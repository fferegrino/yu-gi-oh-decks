So I decided to take a look at Alte,"So uh...orcust is gone. The new January 2020 banlist was surprisingly announced yesterday and, my god did Konami slaughter the meta! So with a brand new meta forming and a whole format before us, I thought I'd take a look at a deck thats been here since the start of master rule 4. Altergeist is another one of those backrow-centered decks that revolve around telling your opponent 'No'. It's main purpose is to get multiple disruptions on board through traps and altergeist monsters &amp;, with its new support, use link monsters to its advantage and slowly peck at your opponent until they die. So with that gruesome explanation, here's my Altergeist build.

To start, this deck is strong. And I mean - <em>really </em>strong. While play-testing I managed to go 9-0 with this deck, facing everything from Orcust to SPYRAL. This deck can search out Multifaker with ease, using cards like: Meluseek, Hexstia, Spoofing and more. You mainly only want to go into either Linkuriboh, Almiraj or Hexstia in the extra - however all the other cards are also good and work well in certain situations. Unlike a lot of builds, I do not run Kidolga. I think it's not that useful and there are other optimal cards you could play, especially when maining Pot of Extravagance.

Since the new banlist kinda killed the whole format - I sided in cards based on previous match-ups. I'd definitely recommend siding at least two copies of Imperial Iron Wall and a playset of Secret Village - for the added degeneracy. Other than that; Lancea and Evenly Matched are my only other recommendations. The rest could just be filler, like an extra copy of Knightmare Phoenix or an Abyss Dweller that you'll probably never make.

My build can also use chain-blocking to its advantage: let's say you opened a Meluseek and a Pookuery. You normal the Seek and link it away using Pook's effect; making Hexstia. Then, search a Multifaker with Seek, and chainblock it with Pookuery. That way you have a free spin during your opponents turn. After that - Link away Hexstia into Linkross, and bam! You have another search for an Altergeist trap plus two tokens for next turn.

Overall; this deck is a hard 9.3/10. Going first you'll <em>always </em>win game 1. You can end on so many disruptions and - even when they break your board - still manage to plus 2 and possibly kill your opponent. The only minor downfall is game 2 or 3 - but if you know your match-up then simply siding in some cards will end your opponent quickly. This is definitely a deck I'm considering for the new format - and I'd recommend it to players experienced with the game, or even just starting!"

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

Do you like Gren Maju, banish cards gain a lot LP and ATK. But you think in these times with this deck I won't win with anyone. Nothing more wrong, with a good idea you can do a lot. And this is the most beautiful in YGO new life old cards.

Give control of it to your opponent than special summon. Special summoning will trigger Ryu Okami's effect allowing you t0 send a card from your extra deck to the graveyard. Send Cyber Dragon Nova, which will let you special summon from the extra deck, which will trigger Ryu Okami's effect again, etc.

<strong>Main Combo</strong>

You will need the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Ryu Okami in your GY</li>
 	<li>Give And Take Set on the field</li>
 	<li>Photon Sanctuary in your hand</li>
</ul>
First activate Photon Santuary which gives you 2 tokens. Than activate Give and Take which will special summon the Ryu Okami in your GY to your opponent's field. It will also change the level of one of your tokens but that doesn't matter. Link away your tokens and make Hip Hoshiningen. This will trigger Ryu Okami's effect allowing you to send Cyber Dragon Nova to your GY which will allow you to special summon Cyber End Dragon which will trigger Ryu Okami again and again. You can summon up to 3 Cyber End Dragons, but the third one will also trigger Ryu Okami. At this point you have 2 more options:
<ul>
 	<li>If you have Felgrand in grave, you can send Prank-Kids Battle Butler to grave which will special summon felgrand.</li>
 	<li>You can send Elder Entity N'tss which can destroy a card on the field when sent to your GY.</li>
</ul>

Since Anubis didn't play a full deck, i used cards that fit his theme since he was essentially the Egyptian lord of the dead, mummies &amp; Zombies were his main theme that i feel represented his character perfectly. My character decks are not meant for Official Yugioh Tournaments. Fun play only.

Fresh strong first turn board wit","<a href=""https://youtu.be/_s0XaT5czYg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/_s0XaT5czYg</a>

Fan favorite Generaider forged with Orcust and World Legacy making it competitive, fun, and fresh with new gameplan and interaction. Best card is Girsu, not only it can start your full combo, it is an Orcust piece too which means very useful in the grind game. I will explain full Lib combo with Girsu (1 card combo).

For the Lib combo, you normal summon Girsu, dump World Armor, activate Girsu ss token, link off token for Linkuriboh, ss Lib (using Linkuriboh, important), activate Lib search Succession, activate Succession ss World Armor, activate World Armor add Monsrtosity, link Lib off for Linkross, activate Linkross (chain Lib if you want to spin opponent's card) ss 2 tokens, ss Linkuriboh from GY using token, ss fusion Trishula (using token, Linkuriboh, and World Armor), activate Monstrosity (ss 2 lv9 from deck or 1 lv9 from hand) ss Mardel and Dovelgus, activate Mardel add Genereaider Boss Stage, activate Dovelgus ss Orcust from hand, overlay 2 lv9 for True King of All Calamities, and proceed with your Orcust combo (using Linkross and Orcust you just ss before).

The Orcust combo ceiling is low without Harp (basically revolves around Orcust Knightmare, dump Wand, activate Wand ss Knightmare from banished pile; Brass ss Orcust from hand; Cymbal ss Orcust from GY), so dont expect much. During opponent's draw phase, Stage can be activated in response to opponent's normal draw, ss Hoarr along with Generaider tokens (fodder for Hoarr or I:P).

Card synergies: Hoarr (dark for Allure, lv9 for Monstrosity), Mardel (searches Stage, lv9), Dovelgus (ss Orcust from hand, lv9), 2 Wand + 2 World Armor (just in case it's drawn, combo pieces, World Legacy fodder for Orcustrated Return, dark for Allure, dumped Wand can ss Armor from hand), 1 Cymbal, 1 Brass (if Cymbal is drawn, you can dump this and ss Cymbal from hand, essentially acting like a second Cymbal while can summon other Orcust from hand too), and the staples like handtraps + s/t removal + generic draw cards.

Extra deck: Combo pieces (including Orcust), I:P + Topologic/Knightmare (can be used with Generaider tokens), and other rank 9 target (Enterblathnir or Infinitrack). It is hard to make Borrelsword, so you can replace it with other generic if you want.

Side deck: Matchup specific.

Cards to think of: Scrap combo (good one, but needs more space and we already choose Lib combo), Unchained Abomination (or all other great I:P target; extra deck is too tight, you have to replace something to include this, applies to other generic extra deck monsters too), Gizmek Orochi (resource is important, so the banishing cost is too big of price to pay; can be played depends on you), your suggestion cards go here.

Full combo replay: <a>http://bit.ly/2RsM1U8</a>

Expected 1st turn: (with Crescendo set)<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/CTsShRR.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Great first turn board, possible disruptions (I:P to Unicorn or Topologic), possible negations (Crescendo, True King of All Calamities, Hoarr), Orcust recursion and protection, big bodies, sometimes can play through handtraps, lots of handtraps for going second, and easy OTK.

Cons: Board can be shut down using strong cards like Super Poly etc (but Calamities effect will still linger even after being outed, so another pros), drawing the lv9 Generaider sucks sometimes.

PS: Shoutout to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/vz6ldDKyOnM"">Lithium2300</a> for the Lib combo."

UPDATE! good cards to add in this deck are 3 copies of demise of the land which activates mystic mine, and one copy of metaverse which does the same thing.

&nbsp;

This deck focuses on drawing all the five pieces of Exodia while holding back the opponent with the mystic mine.

Try to have 3 reckless greed seted because of that you draw 6 cards and you wait just 2 turns to draw again, not 6. A good way to add a piece or two or maybe if you are lucky all pieces."

This deck's strategy is to burn away the opponents life points quickly and make sure Uria is well fed. With Emergency provisions and magic planter in there, it helps for activating and swiftly getting rid of Continuous Traps to feed Uria's attack stat. I also added Thestalos the Mega Monarch too as secondary option to help the process of burning the opponent's cards and life points quickly. With this being a purely fire based deck, it makes his effect even more potent."

<p class=""LC20lb DKV0Md"">Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.</p>
Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

I was so excited to hear about this archetype, then they made them cute little pirate trolls and I fell in love. I have done about three days of playtesting with different variants and this is the one I decided to upload. I think this deck has one major issue and that is the attribute restriction. Currently, the deck has one huge restriction and no real way to make it worth it. Whitebeard forces you to only summon in archetype monsters and you need him to make the link monster really useful. Any two monsters including a patroll monster make the link and then you want to have another plunder on the field so that you don't have to equip the link. Then only having three attributes available doesn't really let you make usage of your cards.  So I play two kaijus to try to supplement this. Dogaran and Gameciel are fire and water respectively so you can summon the less common attributes easier. You can cheat these out if you have IKS or if you summon the dark world monster to your opponent's field.

So far I've had a lot of fun with this deck and I will continue to try to improve it for those who are looking. I was surprised that many other people didn't upload variants of this deck. I assume that is because it is a strange archetype and it's hard to find supplemental cards. Try to keep a plunder patroll card in hand during your turn so that you can use the effects of the boats cause often you use all your resources on your first turn. The field spell is the best way to put one back in your hand then discard it for its effect, but this is still not very reliable.

Have fun and please leave comments below as to my ratios. More kaijus, less kaijus, more dangers, play toad...whatever you can think of I would love to hear it."

Well tested and checked Gouki deck with access to the most powerful monsters from extra deck.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/gouki-extra-power-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/gouki-extra-power-2020/</a>

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/very-good-megalith-deck-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/very-good-megalith-deck-2020/</a>

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-trickstars-2020/</a>

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/red-dragon-archfiend-deck-2019-3/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/red-dragon-archfiend-deck-2019-3/</a>

Do you like Gren Maju, banish cards gain a lot LP and ATK. But you think in these times with this deck I won't win with anyone. Nothing more wrong, with a good idea you can do a lot. And this is the most beautiful in YGO new life old cards.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Thunder Dragon gameplay remains the same as before by going first and trying to lock the opponent with it's powerfull monsters, the Master Rule 5 allows better and easier plays by enabling very easy multiple Thunder Dragon Colossus summons on the board. The Nemesis engine adds extenders to go for powerfull control monsters like Apollousa and countains an easy to summon boss monster that can lock the special summons of an attribute (mainly we'll choose dark attribute monsters) for the upcoming opponent's turn or wipe boards following our starting position

The Thunder Dragon package is classical, we have Dragonroar to special summon from the deck/recycle cards, Dragonmatrix to tuto other copies and boost monsters when having a normal summon, Dragondark to tuto other copies and tuto cards, Dragonhawk to resurrect monsters and cycle the hand, and Dragonduo to banish cards from the deck and tuto when having an easy to summon beatstick.

The Danger package generates consistant summons to go for great link monsters like Borrelsword Dragon and Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess when making the xyz 4 and xyz 8 summons easier. They also allows us to get rid of Batteryman Solar that was mainly used as a starter to open Dragonhawk plays and link summons and consumes the normal summon. A Danger monster is a good last play to generate a free target for Archnemesis Protos effect when starting first.

The Nemesis monsters special summon themselves by sending back any banished monster to the deck so you can recycle key cards and spam the board, they are also supplementary types and attributes that enables the summon of Archnemesis monsters to trigger powerfull wipe board/floodgate-like effects. Nemesis Umbrella can recycle Nemesis monsters send to the graveyard by Danger monsters or as materials for extra deck summons, Nemesis Flag tuto Nemesis cards and Nemesis Corridor can recycle banished Nemesis monsters, notably being a one card Thunder Colossus combo and a free trigger for Thunder Dragon Titan's effet. Archnemesis Protos is easy to summon and a good way to pressure opponent's board by destroying all monsters of a chosen attribute and preventing their special summon untill the end of the opponent's turn (basically when gong first we choose Dark that is the most popular attribute in Yu-Gi-Oh! and won't threaten our board since Thunder Dragon Protos will protect itself from destruction)

Aloof Lupine is a great starter that can banish 1 Thunder Dragon from our hand and 1 from our deck so we can trigger 2 effects and have 2 free targets for the summon of low level Nemesis monsters. It's also a free target for xyz4 summons to finamize boards.

Chaos Dragon Levianeer and Destrudo, The Dead Drake of Dread are two good extenders. The first opens easy xyz 8 summons when being a good option to cut 1 card of the opponent's hand when starting first or destroy 2 opponent's card when starting second, and the second is a free synchro 7 summon.

&nbsp;

The spell package is restrained to maximise monster's interactions, we simply use Allure Of Darkness to draw and abuse of it's banishing cost to activate Thunder Dragondark and Dragonroar's effect to have a direct starter and a +2 CA with a direct target for Nemesis monsters. Gold Sarcophagus directly banishes a monster from the deck to start any loop. Thunder Dragon Fusion is a searchable way to summon Thunder Dragon Colossus and recycle ressources when having a direct way to grind the gae for the next turn if there is any. Lastly Monster Reborn is a way to search out specific Thunder Dragon monsters discarded by Danger monsters to use their effects and have an extender that will allow a specific extra deck summon.

&nbsp;

The main extra deck monsters are Thunder Dragon Colossus and Thunder Dragon Titan. Colossus prevents the opponent to use tuto effects and can survive destruction anytime you want since you can banish a thunder monster, it Simply summons itself by tributing a thunder monster after you used a thunder monster effect from your hand (Nemesis Corridor is a one card Colossus since it activates it's effect from the hand to special summon itself, being thunder type). It's level 8 and easy summon conditions, specially in Master Rule 5 format, makes it a direct extender to summon xyz 8 monsters. Titan is a 3200 atk beatstick that can destroy a card without targetting it each time a thunder dragon monster is activated from the hand, meaning you can bypass threats like Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax pretty easily, and sports a protection against destruction by effect with a simple cost of banishing any 2 cards from the graveyard. Note that Thunder Dragonmatrix and Dragondark's hand effect are quick effects, so you can use them to destroy cards during your opponent's turn.

The xyz package countains good control monsters and a great extender. First Number 60 : Dugares, The Timeless can notably draw 2 cards and discard 1 to have a +2 CA if discarding a Danger monster and is a Fire attribute that opens plays on Archnemesis Protos. Evilswarm Nightmare can face down a monster that is special summoned up to 2 times in a row so you can pressure the opponent's extra deck summons, Abyss Dweller lock the opponent's graveyard and Number 38 : Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy is a spell negate that can redirect attacks to protect other monsters in specific configurations.

The only synchro monster is F.A. Dawn Dragster, a spell/trap negate that is free to summon with Destrudo's effect . A summon using Thunder Dragon monsters generates CA by sending them to the grave, meaning a free synchro summon in terms of rentability.

Lastly the Link package countains Knightmare Phoenix and Knightmare Unicorn to handle the opponent's board, mainly backrow, when going second. Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess is a multi monster effect negate and Borrelsword Dragon is a good OTK generator that is a safe gameplan if we open a fair number of Danger monsters.

&nbsp;

Now, the extra deck. This deck likes to open first, so the main siding options are designed to play second.

Twin Twisters, Red Reboot and Imperial Order are great options to handle the backrow focused deck. The first destroys up to 2 backrow cards and is free if discarding a danger monster, the second prevent a trap from activating and completely shut down decks like Altergeist and Subterror, also harming True Draco and Salamagreat strategies, and the third is a radical answer to Pendulum and Sky Striker when being a way to shut down numerous extenders and searchers of other decks.

Nibiru, The Primal Being breaks going first combo decks by tributing all it's monsters and summoning 1 token to replace them, be aware to use it at the good timing since cards like Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess can negate it's effect.

Borreload Dragon is a monster with pretty good built-in protection effect that can bypass the most resilient beatsticks surviving destruction effects.

The Melody Of Awakening Dragon and Archnemesis Eschatos works hand in hand, the first is a spell that tuto the second and can also search a Chaos Dragon Levianeer in addition to Eschatos. Archnemesis Eschatos is a solid answer to type focused decks like Salamangreat and Orcust, and is evenly good against Dargonlink, mirror matches and other decks by enabling OTKs or locking down the opponent Following the match up and our starting position."

This deck draws a fine line between versatility and splashability","Hello! I'd like to apologize for the recent inactivity. I am currently resolving some issues IRL which I don't feel comfortable sharing - but I'll do my best to keep dishing out these awesome decks. I might not be able to upload daily however - so I've set myself a target of a new deck every other day. So with that out of the way, here's the card list.

Adamatia is a strong, independent archetype that archetype that focuses on...nothing? The reason this deck appeals to me a lot - not taking in to account that rocks finally have good support - is it's versatility and the ability to change playstyle on command. It is a synchro based deck that focuses on bringing out tuners, and searching/stacking your deck. I, of course, have decided to make a more-or-less negate heavy strategy: out of impulse of course. Due to them being rock monsters, Block Dragon works surprisingly well in this deck - thats why I run a 6 card engine. The main concept is to use level 4's like Gigantes or one of the eggs - to make Naturia Beast. What's great about this deck, is you most likely will always manage to find a way of summoning it. Instant fusion also helps out - making the level 3 earth attribute fusionist.

A really good tech card that works well with this deck - is Muddy Mudragon. Since it's a level 6, you can make this card at literally anytime due to the Adamatia monsters - with this, you can use cards like Destrudo and use its built in polymerization effect - making Dragun of Red-Eyes. That plus Naturia Beast and some disruptions with the Adamatia synchros and you've got a near unbreakable board.

In conclusion: I'd give this deck a solid 8.2/10. I really like the fact you can play this deck in so many different ways - using cards like Block Dragon to your advantage, and even playing it pure. In my opinion, it deserves all the hype its getting - and will definitely be a fan-favourite after April's new change. Great deck - hopefully konami puts out more bangers!"

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

This deck prevents from using enemy monsters effects and blocks his extra deck.  Much better deck than other decks with this archetype.

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.
<p class=""LC20lb DKV0Md"">Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.</p>
Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

Lucky coin deck but not only that. A decent hybrid deck made up from burn cards , floodgates and of course random effects. Joey Wheeler would be proud.

Very good Megalith deck with Cyber Angel Benten engine. Reinforced with a small “crystron needlefiber” – “glow up bulb” combo giving us extra Link 4.

Its effect, allowing it to be level 8, helps Galaxy Expedition. If you have a Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in the GY, via a Trade-In discard or The Melody of Awakening Dragon Discard, then you can use Galaxy Wizard to search Galaxy Trance and combo from there.

Due to Argosaurus also being a Level 1 monster, you can summon it with Miscellaneousaurus, and if you sent Misc to the Graveyard with its effect first, your opponent will not be able to stop Argo's effect from going off. You still want to go second (obviously), since Argo's effect can make summoning Link Monsters easier, potentially allowing you summon your Link 3 and 4 monsters."

The Last Warrior From Another Planet returns more effective and stronger than ever. Take your opponent spell or trap (with good hand both). Block monster  when you have the advantage on the field. With only the possibility SET monsters  opponent should not threaten  using monsters effects ;)

You like brute force and OP effect ? Since banning RHONGO this is the most powerful effect in the game. There is no draw phase or battle phase fortunately only for the opponent ;)

Or mayby you wont win with finesse and class, using only cut monsters ? With this deck we not afraid super poly, dark ruler no more or evenly matched. We are not afraid also monsters effects.

His eyes are neon green and more circular compared to Flame's eyes, giving him a more youthful look.

&nbsp;

Through banlists, Psy-Frame was indirectly hit by loosing 2 Metaverse and 2 Terraforming that are searchers of Psy-Frame Circuit, the key card of the archetype. So the Sky Striker Engine is usefull to add consistancy by generating draw power, CA and enabling more gameplans if we are forced to go second.

The Psy-Frame monsters works as hand traps, they respond to particular actions to special summon themselves from the hand and special summon a Psy-Frame Driver from the hand/deck/graveyard to negate an effect or an attack and destroy the card (Psy-Framegear Alpha being the exception with it's tuto effect). The two monsters will be banished at the end phase if they remain on the field, and you can only activate this effect if you control no monsters. Psy-Framelord Lambda and Psy-Frame Circuit are the most important cards of the deck, the first bypassing the conditions of activation of the Psy-Framegear monsters and the second consisting on a rapid synchro summon using the two summoned monsters (there are 2 Psy-Framelord synchro monnsters that banishes themselves until the next standby phase to trigger their effect so you control no monsters anymore and can continue to resolve your Psy-Framegear monster effects from your hand even without controlling a Psy-Framelord Lambda). Psy-Framegear's effects can be stopped by Ash Blossom so be sure to use them at the good timings, but since they don't have others activation restrictions and will remain in your hand, you will be able to use them again immediatly.

&nbsp;

The monster engine is built to countain the Psy-framegear that will be usefull in the most cases before siding, so we have 3 Psy-Framegear Alpha to respond to an opponent's summon and tuto, 1 Psy-Framegear Beta to negate an attack and destroy the attacking monster, 3 Psy-Framegear Delta to negate and destroy a spell, and 3 Psy-Framegear Gamma to negate a monster effect and destroy it. Psy-Framegear Epsilon isn't main decked because being able to respond to trap cards is mathematically more specific, so we'll side it to optimize the consistancy. 2 Psy-Frame Driver are enough to avoid bricks when enabling the deck to work even after banishing disruption effect. Blackwing - Steam The Cloak is a one card combo to gain access to Psy-Framelord Lambda : normal summon Cloak then link summon Salamangreat Almiraj to create a token that you'll tribute to summon Cloak from the graveyard, then link summon Psy-Framelord Lambda and use the newly created token to bring out a Linkuriboh and gain a little protection effect for your Psy-Framelord Lambda. Lastly Ash Blossom will slow down the opponent to handle it's boards more easily when starting second, and will back up the Psy-Frame monsters to prevent your opponent to come back by locking a tuto/specific summon effect.

The spell engine countains of course Psy-Frame Circuit, and Sky Striker cards with some generic draw/back up. Psy-Frame Circuit allows instant synchro fusion when a Psy-Framegear's effect resolves, enabling synchro 7 and 8 summons during the opponent's turn since all Psy-Framegear are level 1 and 2 tuners, and sports a battle effect that discards a Psy-Frame monster to boost a Psy-Frame monster you control by the attack of the discarded monster (your monsters will be able to peak at 4000/5000 atk so you can bypass some specific beatsticks or protect yourself). The Sky Striker engine countains Engage to search other pieces of the engine and draw, Hornet Drones to create a token and summon Kagari that will recycle Sky Striker spells, Aterburner to destroy a monster then a backrow card, Widow Anchor to negate a monster's effect and steal it and Shark Cannon to banish a monster from the graveyard or take control of it. Note that if you have to be aggressive you can use the stolen monsters with Widow Anchor/Shark Cannon to rapidly summon a Borrelsword Dragon. Lastly we use Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero because it can send a Psy-Frame Overload to the graveyard if we have one in the opening hand when being able to search a Sky Striker spell, it's equally a neutral target for Set Rotation. Terraforming and Set Rotation are field searchers to get access to your Psy-Frame Circuit, Set Rotation is good combined with Sky Striker Airspace since it won't give benefic effects to your opponent in most cases and can bring out Mystic Mine in some situations. Mystic Mine is a great card to temporize the game if we have a mediocre hand and is also an option to open the game if we go second so we can force out a negate or be safe to make our loops without being interrupted by monster effects. Lastly Foolish Burial Goods send Psy-Frame Overload to the graveyard from the deck and Upstart Goblin and One Day Of Peace are good neutral draw cards that litterally say that we play at 38 cards.

We run only 3 trap cards, one Metaverse to directly seet a field spell from the deck so we have Psy-Frame Circuit or Mystic Mine during the opponent's turn, and 2 Psy-Frame Overload that can banish cards on the field and overall banish itself from the graveyard to tuto any other Psy-frame card. Note that Psy-Frame Overload can be chained to your other effects to protect yourself from some disruptive plays.

&nbsp;

The extra deck is composed of level 7 and 8 synchro monsters that directly help the control gameplan of the deck and a little Link monsters base to concretise boards. First we have Salamangreat Almiraj and Linkuriboh that pairs with the Blackwing - Steam The Cloak combo. Psy-Framelord Lambda allows your Psy-Framegear's effects to resolve even if you control monsters, and tuto any Psy-frame card when one of your Psy-Frame monsters banishes itself (even if he leaves the field). Lastly Borrelsword Dragon is a way to go for aggressive plays/finishers in pair with Widow Anchor and Shark Cannon to use the opponent's ressources.

The synchro monsters first countains Psy-Framelord Zeta and Psy-framelord Omega, level 7 and 8 monsters that can banish themselves to respectively banish an opponent's special summoned attack position monster and a random opponent's card from his hand until the next stanby phase. Zeta can also return from the graveyard to the extra deck to recycle a Psy-Frame monster. Omega can return from the graveyard to the extra deck to return any card from the graveyard to the deck so you can recycle specific monsters, and can return a banished card to it's owner's graveyard during the opponent's stanby phase so you can recycle your Psy-Frame Overload to gain extra tutos. The fact your synchro Psy-Framelords banish themselves means you won't contrl monsters anymore so even if you didn't summoned Psy-Framelord Lambda you will be able to use other Psy-Framegear effects, and when returning to your field they won't use your extra monster zones anymore. F.A. Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage Dragon are a spell/trap negate and a negate all that will back up the Psy-Frame monsters or finish a board if you Don't control Psy-Frame Lambda. Black Rose Moonlight Dragon can bounce monsters to disrupt boards by directly cuting ressources, being a good weapon against fusion and synchro focused decks. Black Rose Moonlight Dragon is a great way to wipe entire boards, mainly if your opponent mostly his backrow. Finally Dragon Ogre Deity Of Tenyi is a good weapon against combo decks that will banish monsters and extenders to prevent comebacks, it can also attack two times in a row on special summoned monsters to add a little offensive power to the deck.

&nbsp;

Now the side deck. It's mainly designed for going second games since we want to go first to set the field for our Psy-Frames to operate.

Twin Twisters can destroy up to 2 backrow cards when potentially discard cards like Psy-Frame Overload, to have a better match up against decks using consistant backrow that could be annoying. Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves is also a searchable card that can destroy 1 backrow card plus 1 monster.

Dark Ruler No More will neutralize combo deck's boards and let you free to set up your board.

Artifact Lancea is a must have that notably stop Orcusts as well as Thunder Dragons.

Psy-Framegear Epsilon is a card to add to countain decks using traps, and is also a good way to handle the most Dangerous floodgates against decks like True Draco.

Stardust Dragon is a specific tech against True Draco that is a hard match up with it's floodgates and backrow that destroy our cards when sent in the graveyard, it has the advantage to stop True Draco's backrow secondary effects and counter Diagram. It tribute itself to resolve it's effect so since True Draco usually Don't run Called By The Grave, it won't be able to hit Stardust Dragon after it's effect resolution so it will come back later to permanently pressure your opponent's plays.

Lastly Borreload Dragon is a way to bypass monsters like Avramax that would be a nightmare for the deck if your opponent is able to bring them out."

Bring on Eternity Code!","Let me just start by saying Eternity Code and Master Rule 5 excites me more than a 5 year old in a toy store. Dusting off the ol' Dinosaur deck ready for April 1st, I've been playing around with different strategies for the deck. An example of this is the new Jewel Beast - Argosaurus. That bad boy is a 1.5 card combo to end on a Linkuriboh, a Rank 4 of your choosing, and either an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno OR Overtex Qoatlus. However, the main combo for this deck involves Ultimaya Tzolkin. Sounds insane right? But thanks to Master Rule 5, it is not only possible, it is the nuts. Ending on a board of Apollousa, a Level 7/8 Dragon Synchro, and either Ultimate Conductor Tyranno OR Overtex Qoatlus is nothing to laugh at. You can further extend this with a Naturia Beast if you have access to Giant Rex. Would I consider this Meta-Breaking? No. But it sure can be difficult for most decks to get around with the buff to Dimensional Barrier.

I will be happy to explain how this combo works if people ask for it."

Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

This new monster allows you to instantly open into the ideal e,"First off, why? I have never used broken to describe a deck on my daily uploads: but what other deck can we call broken if not this one?!

Konami have done the outstanding move of giving an archetype that's already broken - even more disgustingly amazing support. Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu is by far the most fantastic Orcust card. It can work as an combo starter, and extender - and instantly allows you to start up your combo's with a token on board. The list I've made is a rather simple one - focusing on getting the Striker Orcust endboard as fast as possible: which happens nine times out of ten. But there are some insane combos you can make - seeing as though it is both a Mekk-Knight card and becomes a level 4 tuner, which enables ib like never before.

An optimal engine you might want to play is also Scrap. The main reason I cut it was primarily because of Girsu's effect - doing the same if not more, and with the fact that Golem acted as a garnet which somehow I opened way too much! Still the ammount of monsters you normal summon reduces, but if you want to add it I'd recommend cutting the Zerovoros in extra, Mathematician and Phantazmay in main.

An end board you might want to make is most likely Longirsu, Dingirsu, Cresendo and Babel with 1-2 orcust monsters in grave and a Gizmek orochi. With the new support, this practically isnt a challenge - so open well and your opponent might as well scoop. The second board you could make is I:P, babel and some monsters in grave. This instantly opens a way to nuke your opponents board with Zerovoros, and will usually end to passing back to you, and you getting 4K beatstick and your opponent being wide open. Which if you open another combo opener, could lead to a potential OTK.

Overall: this deck deserves no lower than 9.8/10. Orcust are one of the most meta-defying engines out there, making top cut almost every YCS and Regional there is. With this new support: Konami have shown that this deck will not die, and continue to crush people one-by-one like bugs. As much as we hate this deck: It is one - if not - <em>the </em>best deck in the meta. There is no deck at this moment that can rise up to it, and I'm not surprised why. It has yet to have its fall from grace - despite everyone wanting it to. Can't wait to see this deck rise up to Tier 0 alongside Dragon Rulers and TeleDAD. Konami have made a big mistake..."

Updated for the New Master Rule.,"This deck is the best that it's ever been. With new support (direct and indirect) and Master Rule 5 coming up, this deck can go off with the full Ritual Beast Combo (3 Searches + Floating) or place down an indestructible Crystal Wing + some disruption as a backup plan. The deck has always struggled with consistency, but it can now do something more than -Summon a monster and pray- most of the time. Wynn allows you to search all of your Beasts (except Winda and Lara) or the Wind Witches or even Droll and Lock if you've already got the combo while dumping beasts in the grave to extend. I've been playing Ritual Beasts off and on since they were released and am very satisfied with this list.

&nbsp;

A couple of things you should be aware of:

-The Wind Witches: They lock you out of summoning level 5 or lower Wind Monsters, so if you have Elder+Cannahawk/Pengu or like combo, don't use them. They are for the hands when you can't go off with RB's.

-The Dragon Ruler is to get dead Ritual Beasts out of your grave.

-For Experienced RB players: The Research Lab/Zefra Field spell thing was...neat, but with the limiting of Terra it's just not worth it anymore. Feel free to playtest it and tell me if it's any more consistent, but I don't think it is.

-For Players new to Ritual Beasts: This deck can be deceptively complex. I recommend finding some tutorials online. If you don't know, you can use Ulti-Cannahawks First Effect, then chain his second effect and summon back one of your targets. As long as one makes it to the grave, the search effect still resolves. Opening Elder + Cannahawk/Pengu should net you 3 searches or 2 Searches plus an ideal board (4 RB's + 2 Steeds). Also note that Ulti-Apelio is uneffected by everything when she attacks, so any attack boost it got is shut off (it's annoying). Just remember, practice makes perfect. YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. The deck is VERY rewarding to learn and get better at.

&nbsp;

I've had a love for this deck for a while. I love the art, the cards, and the unique deck playstyle.

Discard and special summon out the arse. 
Win game? 
Profit. ","Papa's got a brand new bag (except not really). &gt;:D
Ok, so in all honesty, this deck is my personal pet project. Has been for a couple years now, basically since the Danger! stuff came out. I sincerely believe the Dangers! can be good all on their own with just a few cards to help them along. No extra engine per se (except my 2 card Dark World Grapha Recycling Service, you can pry that from my cold, dead hands), just a lot of nice cards that play well with the discard-centric mechanics of the deck.

The primary goal is still predominantly the same, except now the deck also has no issue going first, but it's ability to dismantle bigger negate-happy boards relies more on destroy effects than it does... well.. Lava Golem. I mean, it's still there, in the side, since we don't need our normal summons if we side out Vainty's Ruler, but it's not center stage anymore, as it has been in previous iterations. No, instead we welcome two new players to the game; The Fabled Good Boi and Infinite Impermanence! Why? Because Cerburrel isn't once per turn, making him basically another Tsuchinoko to this deck (I.E. good for links and/or tribute summons) and for that unique flavor of removal that is Brionac, and because this deck loses hard, and I mean HARD, to Abyss Dweller. So we run a hand trap that can be used turn 1, or we can at least hope to see it in our opening hand going second. If you don't have Infinite Impermanence, you're probably a sane individual with more reasonable and/or varied hobbies, and you can use PSY-Frame Gamma for the same kind of protection. I opted for the trap because it's got more utility (especially going first or after turn 1) and because it requires only 3 spots instead of 4. Also I hate myself and am a connoisseur of poor life choices.

Going first for the deck, comparatively, is actually a bit of a better time than trying to break really big and obnoxious boards. It's a good time when you can end on a board like, say, Vanity's Ruler, I:P and Lancelot (so as you can negate any nasty Evenly Matched activation as well) and maybe a fodder card, for a Knightmare Unicorn response, but it's also very realistic with a bit of luck. Just remember that, if it's at all possible, your 5th summon should be either Vanity's or Azathot to make sure you don't get Nibiru'd to nothin' but nubs.

On to the extra deck! This is your main toolbox. Anything that can't be popped has to be dealt with from here. Fortunately, between the two Link 4's and Unicorn, you do have a fair few options in that regard, and as long as you've got a bit of luck with your random discards, link fodder is no object. And generally speaking, anything Soldier of Chaos can't deal with, Borreload can.

That's about it, really. I think each step I take with this deck is really only a half-step forward in most cases, but progress is progress. I'll be taking this to a Regional event this weekend, so I can see how it does and maybe do another update with what I learn. This entire description and deck list is mostly for my benefit (as I enjoy keeping a log of not only deck lists but also previous versions of this deck for posterity), but if anybody who deigns to read this has any comments, criticisms or fun words of encouragement, feel all kinds of welcome to speak up. :)

Cheers! And happy new years!"

This banished-based archetype allows you to not only plus, but to get some extra negates on field if you play your cards right; so with that being said, let me explain why this archetype is so good, and what can it do.

First of all, let me just state that this is a splash archetype. I do not see this doing well on its own - it has a nice gimmick and all don't get me wrong, but just not enough cards or good effects to make it worthwhile playing this set of cards by themselves. However: cards like Nemesis Corridor still do have worthwhile effects. You can shuffle back a banished card, like it states, and then use it as fodder for colossus. It's a really cool play, as it allows you to extend and put a restriction on your opponent. Corridor is also available as a target for Raidjin, another disruption. I won't necessarily bother explaining the Invoked combos - as I've covered them in the past.

I run the Striker engine for consistency, and it does the job pretty well. One thing I would want to mention is Protos - it's a decent card and enables targets for your nemesis monsters, but you'd usually side it out game 2 and 3. It's also a nice beatstick when it comes to it, but usually you manage to make a pretty decent control board. Also, when showing the deck to my friend I'd had come to mind that I should most likely clarify: Secure Gardna is the target for Mechaba - just to put it out there.

In the end: this deck deserves a good 8/10. It's nice, and definitely uses the nemesis archetype nicely. Over all, not the best iteration of Invoked, but hopefully you enjoy it and have fun playing the archetype."

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.

Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.

In my opinion completely crazy draw deck with happy end ;)  My completely new unique idea, how to get Exodia in 1 turn.

The Last Warrior From Another Planet returns more effective and stronger than ever. Take your opponent spell or trap (with good hand both). Block monster  when you have the advantage on the field. With only the possibility SET monsters  opponent should not threaten  using monsters effects ;)
