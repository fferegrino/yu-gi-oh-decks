Leave your comments please,"Hello, one and all once again to the land of Yu-Gi-Oh. Today I have prepared for your a Yu-Gi-Oh deck the likes of which have been seen before many times before. I have made a few choices that aren't necessarily spicy but they do divulge from the traditional HERO build. I ask for you to leave questions below because I have been playing this deck for a long time and I would love to answer your questions about the deck. Also, if you have any comments that can make the deck stronger do that as well.  &nbsp;  Here I will explain my main deck tech choices -  3x Twin Twisters -- I refuse to lose to mine and it can be helpful against other super important back row cards like Salamangreat Sanctuary, Lost World, Altergeist, and so on. It can also be a great way to bait out interruptions early.  Pot of Avarice - If you get the standard combo of Faris and any other HERO then you will have five monsters in the grave that don't necessarily need to be there. Extra deck monsters and one or two of's that you would rather draw can go back without hurting the deck at all. Just make sure that you don't get rid of miracle fusion material if thats a potential play for you. I usually do this when I cant search mask change in a turn and I really want to try to draw it.  Pot of acquisitiveness - More Malicious no problem. The same thing with the dynatag, or the cards you banish off vyon. I see it as a way to restart your play if your opponent draws one of their outs to your board. I will say that this and Avarice usually get sided out game two and three. What is important is that the first game has the most randomness to it, and it is always better to reload your resources just in case.  Destiny Hero Decider - I hear one guy say, ""If you need to use celestial then you're losing."" I though long and hard about this and decided to play this instead. You can add back plasma or honest neos which would otherwise be stuck in the graveyard. You can also slow down mystic mine if you can activate monster effects.  Elemental HERO Shining - I won't play Miracle fusion without more than one target. I chose this because you can miracle fusion a nibiru token for its summon. You can also banish Honest Neos from grave, and then when shining is sent to grave (ie linked off) you can add that Neos back. The only time i've wished I had something else was blast. I wouldn't play Anki but that is just me.  &nbsp;  This is where I discuss my side deck options -  Super Poly and its targets - It's Super poly I wont explain more. I play earth golem for spyral and salamangreat. I play Starving venom because it is a good card and many decks use two darks. The third I have is mudragon and it's iffy. I play him mostly for the madolche matchup I think, but there are other situations where you can hit spiral boards, or shadoll boards. It is the least often used choice but I like playing three to cover all the bases.  Red Reboot/Royal Decree - You don't play any traps and altergeist and paleo suck to play against. I side out the pots and reinforcement for these three and keep the twin twisters in.  Dark ruler no more I think I use mostly for Dino and the HERO matchup. Most HERO decks don't play well against other HERO decks. Dino is also this decks worst matchup and I will not debate that with anyone. Dropping a dark ruler on a dino board gives you free rein to destroy their board. I prefer to plasma the UTC off the board instead of just giving it back, and then the monster effects stay off. I try to make dark laws as fast as I can after using Dark Ruler so that their entire field gets banished. I have considered playing evenly matched over this, but it's too expensive.  Ash Blossom - Over all else Ash can kill every deck. Do not jump at the first search, unless it is like turn three. I held an ash against prank kids until mid combo to ash the summon and it stopped him outright. Unless its a normal summoned stratos, or something else that the opponent has to get off and is only once per turn wait to ash.  Thats all guys I hope you like it I have spent a long time making the deck my own and it feels so kickass. Thank you for reading, and please please please leave some comments for me to check out."

Maybe Sunrise to support more then win :)","<p>Despite, this deck does not contain expensive cards like Evil HERO Malicious Bane or Evil HERO Adusted Gold or not even the so popular but pricy Vision HERO combo makers like Vision HERO Faris and Vision HERO Increase, this deck is amazingly fully functional. It relies on the several special summons that the variety of HERO monsters can engage into, the wide variety of fusion monsters the HERO archetype has to offer and all the necessary support in the correct ratio that allow the deck to perform the combos. The main floodgate this deck offers are Masked HERO Dark Law and Destiny HERO Plasma. Masked HERO Dark Law can keep the opponent from attempting GY plays, while Destiny HERO Plasma is the response to any on field monster effect. This deck can rely on many individual special summons, which makes the summoning of Destiny HERO Plasma a lot more easier. Once summoned, Destiny HERO Plasma can also absorb any 1 monster on the field, which by negating all monster effect on the field, it results in a guaranteed to get passed all in build protection that the monster may have and easily perform the steal. The link monster Xtra HERO Dread Decimator and the honest-like effect that Elemental HERO Honest Neos are used to give attack increase to flood gate monsters Destiny HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law and prevent that any monster can run over the low attack values that they individually have. Additionally the newest Fusion monster, at the time of me posting this deck, Elemental HERO Sunrise can give 1 in-battle protection to any 1 HERO monster being attacked except itself, by destroying any 1 card on the field during battle phase, between battle step and before damage calculation.

Then your goal is to bring Frightfur Kraken and Frightfur Tiger out. Tiger will pop any cards on the field up to the number of materials used for its summon.  Kraken can attack twice and Tiger gives both 300 ATK for each Frightfur on the field. So with 600 to both Tiger and Kraken, Tiger popping their monsters and cards, when battle happens if you are not opposed then Tigers 2500 ATK and Krakens 2800 ATK x2 will be 100 life points over OTK.  &nbsp;  A major combo that helps is Bear, Toy Vendor, then WIngs.  Send Bear to the grave to set a Toy Vendor from deck.  Activate it.  Discard Wings from your hand to activate Toy Vendor.  Now, while Wings is in your grave, banish it, with Bear and send the Toy Vendor to grave. (It doesn't HAVE to be Bear, any other Fluffal works too)  This will let you draw 2 and search your Deck for any Fluffal or an Edge Imp Sabres.  &nbsp;  Frightfur Patchwork is an amazing card in this Deck, if it gets ""Ashed"" however, it really hurts.  Frightfur Fusion is great when the first strategy wont work, if you can get Tiger out or Sabre-Tooth, then use Frightfur Fusion while you have Edge Sabres in grave and a ton of Fluffals, then you can Fusion for Frightfur Wolf, who can attack up to the number of materials used for Fusion.  &nbsp;  Good luck"

You can read more about Trinity Format here.</a>  The idea behind this deck was both to provide a more solid and streamlined focus for the Cyber Dragon decks I've played in the past and attempt to adapt the strategy to a future where Megafleet will lose a lot of its luster.  The main plan was to create beneficial trades and eliminate threats in the opponent's board while building up to the win condition of the deck, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>. (To be fair, Infinity himself only came up in two games and in one of them the opponent conceded instantly). The method to accomplish this was, of course, another key card of the deck: <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>. Its milling effect is probably the most important thing in this deck because it opens up a lot of lines of play depending on your hand/field/GY. Namely, if summoned during the opponent's turn (with <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion </a>or <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion </a>for example) you can cheat the 3 summon limit and make infinity by milling <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz </a>and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>.  The ABCs exist as an alternative starter engine and potential mills for Rampage, with <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster </a>himself being quite a potent threat against a lot of strategies that rely on floating, thus earning the title of the alternative win condition.  As for the co forbidden/semi forbidden cards, unfortunately Infinity and ABC are semi and co respectively, increasing the deck's size substantially. For my second co forbidden I opted for <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster </a>and, finally, I decided to play trinities of <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core </a>and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>. Core himself is the starter of the deck and the extra copy both increases consistency of your plays and allows you to be less limited in his use, especially concerning his second effect. The double Herzes are quite interesting in that they provide more opportunities for recycling used Cybers or pseudo-searches with Rampage but they also create a perfect loop as discard fodder.

Consistent Aromaseraphy Marjoram + Cross Rose + Black Garden with great recur,"<img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b1/Akiza_Izinski.png"" alt=""image"" />  Cross Rose Dragon is an underrated link monster coming in Duel Overload. This deck will fully utilize its potential at disrupting and recursion. I'm building this deck under current World banlist (OCG has Linkross but with Lonefire Blossom and Predplant Ophrys Scorpio on the list, while TCG has 3 Lonefire and Ophrys while still waiting for Linkross). So using one of the banlist is kinda even out the upside and downside.  Basic strategy is getting <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax + random level 3 monster</strong> on the field. To achieve that, the Predaplant package is very suitable, also they are plant monster which work with the rest of this deck. Scorpio + its fodder in hand can result you a full combo, making it your best card and one card starter. The route is similar to Releaser Dragun combo route (good route for generic synchro). Summon Scorpio, use Scorpio ss Cobra, use Cobra add Instant Fusion, use Instant Fusion ss Sea Monster of Theseus, link off Theseus + Scorpio/Cobra for Halqifibrax, use Halqifibrax ss O-Lion, link Halqifibrax off for Linkross, use Linkross ss token (we only need one token, can summon 2 but beware of monster zone getting clogged), tune O-Lion and token for Martial Mech Marcher, use O-Lion and Martial ss O-Lion again and a Mecha Phantom Beast Token, synchro summon Marjoram using Martial + Mecha Phantom Beast Token and Garden Rose Maiden using O-Lion+Cobra/Scorpio, use Marjoram and Garden Rose Maiden add Blessed Winds and Black Garden, link off Garden Rose Maiden + Linkross for Cross Rose Dragon.  It's hard to play the combo in MR4 because Linkross only provides one link arrow. The rest of the cards are just to turbo out Scorpio or being a lv 3 monster for Halqifibrax combo and bunch of power cards like handtraps and its prevention, and some breaking board/backrow card.  Expected first turn:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/xJB9vci.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Very consistent combo, great recursion thanks to Cross Rose, Garden Rose Maiden, and Blessed Winds. Can include power cards like handtraps or to break board.  Cons: Very bad matchup against dino deck esp with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, the Rose Dragon Synchros miss timing alot, like Black Rose Dragon cant activate if ss from Cross Rose activating during a chain link 2 and Black Rose Moonlight Dragon (not even a Rose Dragon) might miss timing too despite being an ""if"" effect."

The main strategy here is graveyard setup and big numbers. Uni-Zombie gives you access to synchro plays, so you can always blow up the field with Black Rose to nuke the field and attack directly with King of the Skull Servants (hopefully). You can actually summon BLS because Wightprincess is a Light attribute for some reason, but she is the only one in this deck so he can brick a lot. Lady in Wight makes King of the Skull Servants spell/trap immune, which is pretty cool.  I have Princessprite in the Extra Deck because she is the best generic rank 1, and Wightprince activates when detached as XYZ material, so that's a thing. Underclock Taker is good for setting up OTKs because it just gives you a 0 attack monster to swing into if he's pointing to King. Beelze because I can. Borrelsword because I own one, and I would be dumb to not use it.  As far as some of the techier options in this deck:  -Hey, Trunade! is a good bait card. you either waste an opponents negate or get rid of their Solemns, and if nothing else you can set it as a dud for them to pop.  -Final Attack Orders is actually really fun in this deck because it pretty much eliminates stall strategies outside of Waboku and Battle Fader.  -MST over Twin Twisters because I prefer to not discard on my backrow destruction.  -Grand Horn because of personal preference.  The side deck isn't an actual side deck, it's just some cards I've experimented with and had mixed results with. Opti-Camouflage Armor just made me feel bad, plus it doesn't work when Lady in Wight is on the field. Snowman Effect is just a win more card. Battle Mania is kind of pointless because if your opponent just gets rid of all of their monsters they don't have to attack, but when it works you pretty much win instantly. Shiranui Style Solemnity is actually pretty decent, but I don't like banishing all of my stuff (also why I don't run allure). Thunder Dragonduo would work really good with Solemnity if it returned banished monsters during both end phases, but since it works only on your opponent's end phase, it's too slow to do much. Creature swap gives your opponent a 0 attack King to swing into, and then revive to attack with, but you have to control two Kings for it to work."

A very liner deck that aims for the OTK with its boss monsters, Gaia The Magical Dragon Champion and Sky Galloping Gaia The Dragon Champion. Both these monsters are treated as Gaia the Dragon Champion when on the field which synergieses well with both new and old support. They both each also have unique effects which are optimal for different situations. The new Gaia The Magical Dragon Champion has the ability to destroy a card as a quick effect during the main phase at the cost of 2600 attack and gains 2600 attack after destroying an opponents monster by battle. On the other hand Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion searches Spiral Spear Strike upon summon and can change the battle position of opponents monsters it battles. The new fusion spell Spiral Fusion doubles the attack of both of these monsters and allows them to make up to two attacks on monsters per battle phase. Cursed Dragon - Curse of Dragon searches a spell or trap card that specifically lists Gaia The Dragon Champion in its text and when its used as fusion material can negate the effects of all your opponents monster with less attack than a Gaia The Dragon champion you control. It be special summoned from the hand or graveyard with Gaia the Magical Knight, who can be normal summoned without tribute if you control no monsters or your opponent controls a monster with 2300 or more attack. Bombarding Catapult Turtle acts as a Lonefire Blossom for the deck, tributing a monster in order to special summon a Gaia The Fierce Knight Monster or a level 5 dragon monster from the hand or deck. The field spell Charging Gaia serves as the main searcher of the deck, searching either a Gaia The Fierce Knight monster or level 5 dragon by revealing the corresponding card in your hand. Charging Gaia also has an additional effect that prevents your opponent from activating cards of effects during the battle phase, ensuring an OTK. The final piece of new support used in this deck comes in the form of Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight. It can be brought out by tributing a dragon fusion you control and can change an attack position monster to defence when summoned. These effects are good for pushing for the OTK or dodging effects and attacks. It also has the additional effect to tribute itself to search out a level 7 or higher warrior type monster, making it a good utility one of. There were also traps released that supported Gaia, but I felt that they were unnecessary in a dedicated OTK strategy.  The other cards included in the deck were to clear the field for an easy OTK. Hand traps such as Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring and Infinite Impermanence as well as generic go second cards such as Lightning Storm, Instant Fusion and Super Polymerization. Some older support such as Curse of Dragonfire, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of Beginning and Gateway to Chaos were also utilized to increase consistency.  The biggest weakness of the deck is being forced to go first, which is why I included a Dragun of Red-Eyes package in the side deck for when that happens."

If you draw 2 combo Fire fists this is what you search. Only 1 because Red resonator and Kaleido Chick are your primary normal summons, but the deck would take a massive hit without atleast running the one Elephant</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear </a>- You Never ever mind drawing this because its a combo piece of a hyper common combo, you want to draw this infact. I enter Tiger King loops 90% of games</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Rooster</a> - Another reason you need Elephant is to make Drawing Rooster amazing. You always need Rooster in a deck for Horse Prince, You also kinda need 2 in a deck for Tiger King. 3 would be bricky tho but my deck justifies running 2 better then any other incosistent Fire fist list you saw</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Buffalo"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Buffalo</a> - Commonly dumped of Eagle tho sometimes you dump bear to revive it off Eagle, just a free lvl 4 summon off Eagle. This is not a bad draw he is a combo piece, No lvl 4 fire fist is a bad draw, and tbh each fire fist monster in this deck is a fine draw. You really just dont wanna draw 2 rooster or 2+ Dragons.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven</a> - Required combo piece for some combos. Sometimes you need Raven for Rooster, the card is good combo piece overall</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Dragon"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Dragon</a> - Because you literally summon this card sometimes 7 times a turn.. Yep 7, combo piece and an extender, Drawing 2 is horrid but it shouldnt happen in a 45 card deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Coach Soldier Wolfbark"">Coach Soldier Wolfbark</a> - Adopted by Fire fist familiy, he is needed for Tiger King loops, he is the first card you summon along with second bear. I showcased this 6 months ago everyone has cought up to it. You typically summon Bear + Wolfbark, Then 2x Dragon, then 2x rooster, then 2x Lunalight cards.</li> </ul> <strong>Fire Formation core 8 - Spells, 1 trap</strong>.  - You might think this is a little but keep in mind Resonator and Luna engine turbo out the fire formation spells via Either Horse prince or Tiger King, thats just smarter then running the bad formations or more of the Ok ones. <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fire Fist Tenki"">Fire Fist Tenki</a> - better then in standard Fire Fist deck (In pure FF deck tensu is the most important FF spell) because it searchers Lunalight engine to which means this card became a better extender Tiger King summons Kaleido Chicks and sets tensu to net you Tiger (Certain loops)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fire Fist Tensu"">Fire Fist - Tensu</a> - just amazing, the activation is not OPT which matters, without this card the deck would suck at tiger king loops.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fire Formation Domei"">Fire Formation - Domei</a> - searchable extender, Usually rooster sends it to the graveyard so that you can revive a Dragon so that Dragon can revive again.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fire Fortress Atop Liang Peak"">Fire Fortress Atop Liang Peak</a> - 10 counters Turn 1, in some rare combos you cant do that but then you put 6 counters search Tiger and end on impressive board anyway, He summons Ancient warrior link Shuanglong or Gladiator beast Heraklinos if you arent Horse Prince restriction locked.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ultimate Fire Formation - Sinto"">Ultimate Fire Formation - Sinto</a> - Hi dark ruler no more, bye. Its hopt, you can access 2 every game but I value consistency over power, you dont need more power</li> </ul> <strong><span>Lunalight Engine <span>-</span></span></strong><span><span><strong> You cant play just 7 monsters</strong>, you need a second lvl 4 sendable of Kaleido chick for some combos, because else you cant Revive anything since every lunalight is under xyz material, and it has to be lvl 4 because thats what makes Diamond Dire Wolf</span></span> <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Lunalight Kaleido Chick"">Lunalight Kaleido Chick</a> - this + tiger or red resonator is a long Tiger King loop which does like 7 negates + tornado + dweller.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Lunalight Tiger"">Lunalight Tiger</a> - Searchable of LiangPeak, Resonator combos, Just a great card tbh</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Yellow Marten"">Lunalight Yellow Marten</a> - You either run 2 Marten, or 1 Marten + 1 any other lvl 4 Luna (Emerald being one of the better ones)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lunalight Emerald Bird"">Lunalight Emerald Bird</a> - This card adds mini consistency while Marten adds mini resiliency to d.d crow..

You can check out their video here if you want: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4WWV23YvUA&amp;t=407s</a>  &nbsp;  As soon as I saw this amazing use of <a data-name=""rescue ferret"">rescue ferret</a> and <a data-name=""cyber-stein"">cyber-stein</a> I imediatly tried to make a new zombie deck for myself because I really love zombies. It turns out that the deck is actually insane under the new master rule with <a data-name=""Crystron Needlefiber"">Crystron Needlefiber</a>. The main goal of the deck is to go first and get <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> and <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a> on the field so you can negate literally anything except <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler no more"">Dark Ruler no more</a>. I would like to note that I don't play the expensive dangers in this deck because I simply don't have them and I wanted to build a deck without them.  There are some cards that I added to the deck which I like to explain:  <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>: This card is actually perfect for the deck, it lets you discard any card in your hand and it is dark which makes it easier to go into <a data-name=""Curious, The lightsworn dominion"">Curious, The lightsworn dominion</a> which is the main part of your combo.  <a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a>: I have never seen anyone use this card but let me tell you: it is actually insane. First of all it is a rank 2 tuner(also dark) which makes it a target for needlefiber. Second of all you can special summon him if you banish him with the effect of <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>. He also lets you draw and discard 1 card if you special summon a zombie from your grave while he is on the field which is pretty good aswell. Also if you already have <a data-name=""Cyber-Stein"">Cyber-Stein</a> in your grave and you don't need 2 search him with <a data-name=""Rescue ferret"">Rescue ferret</a> you can actually summon <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> and <a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a> from your deck instead.  <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>: I don't really like him in the deck but I feel like you have to play him for 2 reasons: 1. It can happen that your only option will be to send him to the grave with <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> or <a data-name=""Armageddon knight"">Armageddon knight</a> to go into needlefiber. 2. He is actually really useful if you have multiple <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> in your hand.  <a data-name=""Burial from a different dimension"">Burial from a different dimension</a>: This card is actually broken with <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>. It is the best feeling to get 3 Mezukis back into the grave.  <a data-name=""Pot of Acquisitiveness"">Pot of Acquisitiveness</a>: recycle your banished <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>.  <a data-name=""Jewels of the Valliant"">Jewels of the Valliant</a>: just another foolish for the deck.  &nbsp;  Hope you enjoy the deck!  &nbsp;  <strong>Update:</strong> Í don't play plaguespreader, burial from a different dimension and pot of aquisitiveness anymore and I think the deck is more consistent now. The addition of <a data-name=""Union carrier"">Union carrier</a> is really good for the deck since it provides another way to dump <a data-name=""Necroworld Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>, <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>, <a data-name=""Glow up bloom"">Glow up bloom</a> or even doomking into your grave.  <strong>Siding:</strong> if you go second exchange:  <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber-Stein"">Cyber-Stein</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>  <a data-name=""Jewels of the Valliant"">Jewels of the Valliant</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""World legacy succession"">World legacy succession</a> <strong>with</strong> <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> <strong>/</strong> <a data-name=""Twin-Twisters"">Twin-Twisters</a> <strong>/</strong> <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a><strong> /</strong> <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>  <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>, <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> with<a data-name=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon""> Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyovertum"">Predaplant Triphyovertum</a>  &nbsp;"

Send Paleozoics to the GY to summon eldlich, I guess. I really made this deck because i noticed Eldlich uses a bunch of traps and spells, so just put them there.  I would probably increase the amount of El Dorodo Aledeltando, since I find my self not getting it very often. Hastor is just in case you get the level 2 ice barrier tuner in there. Doomking is there as a target for elixir spells/traps, and you can chain it off summoning Eldlich (there's no zombie world because it interfears with summoning Toad). Necro face is there because I like having a way to shuffle my banished cards.  Feel free to change the ratios of cards and let me know your experience"

Going first is no problem, going second can be OTK!","""Mathmech"" is a very underrated archetype that can explode on your opponent very quickly and end games and matches fast. The deck is tricky to beat around with constant increase and decrease of attack (which can also take place during the damage step), the deck can create pretty good hand advantage and has a pretty solid grave recovery from extra deck monsters/spells/and main deck monster effects. This version of the deck can go first and actually it has been better in my opinion to go first against meta decks because there are ways you can stop deck searching, and clear the field without destroying monsters/spells-traps all on your opponent's turn.  Going First,  The opening play is to get two monsters on the board. Usually you want to start with <strong>Balancer Lord</strong> and ANY other monster is fine but its better if you have one that can be S<em>S</em> just in case his effect gets negated for the extra normal summon, you'd then <em>SS</em> <strong>Mathmech Addition</strong>, <strong>Subtraction</strong> or <strong>Sigma</strong> (<strong>Note</strong>: When u <em>SS</em> S<strong>igma</strong> try to <em>XYZ</em> summon using him so he goes to grave and his effect can be activated from the grave otherwise he'll be banished). Next you go into your extra deck for links, <em>link</em> summon <strong>Link Disciple</strong> and then <em>Link</em> summon <strong>Link Devotee</strong>. Use effect of<strong> Disciple</strong> to tribute D<strong>evotee</strong> and then use D<strong>evotee's</strong> effect to summon 2 tokens. Next, you summon <strong>Cyberse Wickkid</strong> by <em>linking</em> one token and D<strong>isciple</strong>, and then use the other token to summon L<strong>inkuriboh</strong>. <strong>Wickkid's</strong> effect will then activate allowing u to add a ""Cyberse"" tuner from deck to hand by banishing a monster from grave BANISH TARGET WILL BE <strong>BALANCER LORD</strong> (<strong>Note</strong>: NEVER banish ""Mathmech"" monsters, with this effect only <em>link</em> monsters or <strong>B</strong><strong>alancer lord</strong>). If you already have <strong>Mathmech Nabla</strong> in hand add <strong>Mathmech Sigma</strong>. Then <strong>B</strong><strong>alancer lord</strong> effect will activate from being banished allowing you to <em>SS</em> one from the hand to which you <em>SS</em> <strong>Nabla</strong>. Use <strong>Nabla</strong> effect to tribute <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> to <em>SS</em> a ""Mathmech"" monster from deck. (Note: Selection is important, DO not <em>SS</em> <strong>Addition</strong> or <strong>Subtraction </strong>these are the monsters you want to draw into) (Note: Try and pick Mathmech monsters of different names, you want to have atleast 3 different named targets in the graveyard.) Next step is to <em>XZY</em> summon <strong>Primathmech Alembertian</strong> and use his effect to search the deck for <strong>Mathmech Superfactorial</strong>. Set it and any other cards and pass turn.  <strong>Mathmech Superfactorial</strong> is a game changer. This card is essentially your key to stopping plays because it allows you to <em>Synchro</em> or <em>XYZ</em> Summon on your opponents turn. Your main target for this card is going to be<strong> Primathmech Laplacian</strong> to send one monster/spell-trap/and card in hand to the grave.  Going Second OTK  Very Simple... Do what you can to make <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> and beef him up! <strong>Final Sigma</strong> is a low-key broken AF card! cannot be effected by anything while in the extramonster zone, also he does DOUBLE battle damage. <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> + <strong>Mathmech Billionblade Nayuta</strong> = GG  <strong>Mathemch Billionblade Nayuta</strong>  This card can be equiped to any ""Cyberse"" monster, and during the damage step you can send one ""Mathmech"" monster from your deck to the grave to increase your monsters attack by the attack of the sent monster. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: if you send <strong>Division</strong> to the grave you can halve your opponents monsters attack as well, if you send<strong> Multiplication</strong> to grave you can double your monster's attack *only if its in extra monster zone) This all happens during the damage step so its very hard to stop/counter."

Who knew that such a man could stack his way into making the number one most hated deck good again in February of 2020. Zoodiac is a deck that focuses on summoning Xyz monsters' using only 1 monster as material. Oh, you thought Galatea into Ding was an unfair combo - try a whole archetype revolved around that. Zoo is regarded by most players from the zexal era as a 'cancer' or 'tumor' in yugioh...but god is it fun! Watching your opponent's life drain out of the eyes as you whisper for the 5th time this turn, ""chain ash blossom"". While it may not be as powerful as it was in Master Rule 3 - Zoodiac can still stand its ground as a solid Tier 3 rogue deck (even if it lost Drident and Broadbull). So with that all out the way - here's all you need to know:  Let's clear things up - this deck will make another feature appearance soon. With Master 5 being released in just under two-or-so months, this deck won't have to rely on using Gravity Controller to free up zones. That being said: there are significant differences to the deck now that's been put through a new format. 1. The Link Monsters. Ignition Assault brought some new cards along, specifically the infamous link one, Gravity Controller. What it essentially does is clears up a spot for you to use, and then spins itself and a card, giving you two free spaces to Xyz summon in. The other monster, Megaclops, is slightly harder to pull off - but can be seen as your ace monster of sorts, obviously after Chakanine (the card you try to go into the most). Its tougher to pull off as you can't always meet its summon requirements - but if you open Cymbal Skeleton its a guaranteed 4000 right to your opponents face. Megaclops also recovers Xyz monsters for you - meaning you can continuously stack Zoodiac monsters even after making your beloved infinitrack.  I've had someone recommend playing a Crescendo as my Galatea target - but in my opinion that's useless. Not only do you have to run only one orcust card - you rarely see juxtaposed with the three desires. So playing it would ultimately be a brick in the end. Other than that - the only thing to address is the handtraps. It may seem a bit overkill but you usually need to run this many in order to provide disruption to your opponent. Surprisingly, two Droll seems like the optimal ratio right now as SPYRAL isn't too much of a threat as it was at the start of the format.  Overall: this deck is a cool 6.4/10. While it definitely won't take up all 16 spots of top cut like it once did, it's still a great deck to play at your locals. It has all the stacking capabilities like it use to, just not as optimal with its core extra deck monsters being banned and the zone rules put in place by Master Rule 4. I'd recommend this deck to those out there still cherishing the good old days of going 12-0 against pure mirror matches for the whole tournament. I mean listen - if Jay can top with it, what stops you from doing the same?"

You're almost ALWAYS going to want to bring Sera out to set up your combos, normal summon a Traptrix and link immediately.  If you don't have a Traptrix, thats why theres two Magical Mallet in the deck, also in case you draw into Double Or Nothing! you can reshuffle it for the Utopia combo later.  If you drew into Shade Brigandine first or second turn, then when you bring out Sera, activate after to activate Sera's effect to bring a Traptrix monster.  Myrmeleo's effect is MANDATORY, even if your opponent doesn't have a spell or trap to destroy, the effect still triggers.  Which triggers Sera to set a Trap Hole.  &nbsp;  Another big combo, is while you have Sera on your field, and a trap in the same column, if you get to activate the trap (Which activates Sera) you can Special summon Myrmeleo RIGHT BENEATH Sera in the same column.  Myrmeleo's effect triggers popping your opponents spell or trap, or triggers anyway. This triggers Sera and you set a trap RIGHT BENEATH Myrmeleo in the same column.  Now that you have three cards in the same column, Iron Dragon Tiamaton gets special summoned to another main monster zone, destroying all other cards in that column, neither player can use zones IN that column either.  Keep in mind that either player can have more than one Extra Monster Zone, if you have Sera out, they cant Link summon if Tiamaton is blocking the other zone.  Now they have to Normal or Special summon monsters the traditional way to get rid of Sera, or use a spell.  If you brought Rafflesia out, your opponent cant target Sera with effects anyways.  PLUS you have the Floodgate Traphole set by Sera in addition to other Traps you have, limiting them tremendously.  &nbsp;  If going first and can Xyz, then I recommend Raflessia,Tornado Dragon, Redoer, or Allomerus, but only if your opponent is using a deck that has many level 4 monsters.  If going Second then Borrelsword or the Utopia combo if set up right. Pentestag can allow either to pierce so keep that in mind.  Sera activates to ANY normal trap, even your opponents.  Sera is ALSO unaffected by traps in general, meaning you can use your own on her to get her effect to trigger.  Dionaea can target another Dionaea in the grave, which will activate her special summon effect.  Dionaea special summon effect is to set a Trap Hole from grave but banish it during your next turn if still on field, Mantis has a Quick effect however, to bounce one of your Spells/Traps to hand and set another. Getting rid of the bad effect of Dionaea.  Good luck, those are the main strategies I use while shutting down my opponent!"

There's no Mystic Mine, there's no Obliterate, no Incarnate, and it's not a Burn De","<strong>Please note...</strong>  This deck is not like the others. There's no Mystic Mine, no Obliterate, no Incarnate, and this isn't one of those burner decks where you just burn cards to thin out your deck until you get all 5 pieces. All of those strategies are boring, no fun and everyone else uses them. They have ruined Exodia and have given the deck a bad name. No, this is a 100% original strategy to get all 5 pieces of Exodia legitimately. I spent months and months working on this deck and I'm honestly very proud of it. There are some things that need to be worked out but this deck is BY FAR the best Exodia Deck there is. I'll let everyone test the deck out for themselves and see what they think. But for this deck to be successful, you need to know a few things. <ul>  	<li>This deck has 2 huge strengths that are the main focus point. <ul>  	<li>Link Summoning - Summon either Blue Dragon Summoner, Witch of the Black Forest or Jester the Fiend Jester and use them with Magician's Circle. If you have Trap Trick, you can set magician's Circle and Activate it on the same turn. This lets you summon an extra monster. After doing that, switch to Main Phase 2 and Link Summon any of the Monster that you can. This sends both pieces to the GY, getting you 2 Exodia pieces on 1 turn. If you can, preferably Link Summon Wee Witch's Apprentice or Wynn, the Wind Charmer. When destroyed you get to add another Dark Spellcaster or Wind Monster to your hadn't which really comes in handy.</li>  	<li>This strategy works best if you have Inferno Reckless Summon in your hand. If you do, when it's time to choose a monster to Special Summon for Magician's Circle. <strong>MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE BLUE DRAGON SUMMONER! </strong>This is important because this will activate Inferno Reckless Summon. This lets you Special Summon 2 other Blue Dragon Summoner's to the field. Now you can link Summon all 3 of them (Blue Dragon Summoner's effect isn't once per turn) AND ALSO the first monster you attacked with Magician's Circle. That's 4 monsters being sent to the Graveyard which gets you 4 Exodia pieces.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>The 2nd Strategy is for Draw of Fate. But I'm going to keep that to myself for now. Comment or message me if you're curious on what the strategy is. I know you probably think you got it already. But there's a lot more to it then you think.</li> </ul> <strong>ENJOY!</strong> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li></li> </ol> </li> </ol>"

Then, if you're going first, you'll generally want Strahl out on the field for a negate and the special summon during their standby,  If going second, Strahl is still great, however, if House is on the field, your girls switch to their dragon forms at the start of battle, she will destroy opponents monsters on the field for each that switch, at the end of battle if they still have monsters and you switch back she can pop even more.  Guardragon Legacy is good after you fuse to bring your girls back out on the field for more swarming potential.  You can have one of your girls switch to a dragon then use Tinkhec to give it 2000 attack until the end of turn and then have another switch into the Tinkhec now in grave.  Send Off is good for either switching for the summon requirements or switching during their turn to activate Houses effect to destroy when one returns to hand  Good luck, they are extremely fun to use and you'd be surprised how many people forget they switch in battle!"
