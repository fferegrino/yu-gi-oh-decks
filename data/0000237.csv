The effect of Minerva is basically just a draw 3 in this deck and Qaroth is a draw 2. This deck is hyper-consistent due to the amount of graveyard setup and drawing. You have cards like Pot of avarice to help prevent yourself from decking out though you will usually just win by then due to the insane effects that the Lightsworn archetype gets from milling your own deck.

You redo your moves in a cyclic way and forcing interactions with the opponent. Besides how <a data-name=""Snake Rain"">Snake Rain</a> is an absurd card you always send a lot of Ogdoadic monster to the gy in the first game turn and so your deck arrives in turn 3 with 25 cards or less. which greatly improves the top deck of the engine used in conjunction with Ogdoadic. (<a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> + Any Normal Summon) and (<a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> + Any Random Card in Hand) already guarantee you by the 4 main engine names in circulation: <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a>, <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a>, <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> and <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt</a> and thus the cycle can be redone in the next turn. A serious problem with the deck is the advantage it gives the opponent because there are monsters that have a <strong>floating effect</strong> when they leave the field to the gy or when they simply go to the gy, such as the <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Kitt"">Tri-Brigade Kitt</a> and <a data-name=""Nervall"">Nervall</a>, among other examples such as the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Destroyer"">Destroyer Phoenix Destroyer</a>. Enforcer that I happened to be able to send it to gy with the <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> effect and when I used <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> eff it brought the DPE back and that way the floating effect was alive again. As for <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt</a>, the situation is even more complicated because the opponent being able to add a monster to his hand is the worst condition a card could have since many times the card he adds back are hand traps like <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom </a>and <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> that will disturb you too much. That's why Ogdoabyss' best matchup is against Trap decks because they almost never have monsters in the gy so Keurse and Aleirtt's effects become free, but of course a card like <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> solves the problem for the opponent who is Another risk factor in the deck's gameplay: having <strong>Aleirtt banned</strong> virtually makes it impossible for your engine to continue recycling resources. Another problem with the Ogdoadic engine is the fact that you don't retain resources in the hand so as all monsters are in the gy you always find yourself at a card disadvantage in relation to the opponent during turns. About me not using <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a> in this build and its relationship with <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a>: It is the best interaction that the Ogdoadic engine provides us but you will hardly summon it when tribute 3 monsters but with Water Lily and that's the big problem around the card, the fact that it is only <strong>viable if you use multiple copies</strong> of Water Lily and in the beginning when I tested the deck I used 3 copies because it is excellent in the grind game. Then I saw that the deck needed more consistency and I cut it down to 2 copies and finally I realized that Water Lily <strong>doesn't improve</strong> any play of the Ogdoabyss engine if you try to use it <strong>as a Starter</strong> along with <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> or <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> then it is a card that just is good when you have at least 4 Reptiles in GY or have already accessed <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> and Keurse Summon Nauya plays so it doesn't make your engine come out of inertia unless you have already activated other Ogdoabyss cards and therefore lower it for 1 copy was excellent for maintaining deck consistency. I say that using multiple copies of Water Lily is only good if you are using the pure version of the deck. What brought me the most doubts about this build is the use of <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a> or <a data-name=""Aron, the Ogdoadic"">Aron, the Ogdoadic</a> and their speech as follows: Aron has an <strong>interaction effect</strong> that's easier to resolve than Amunessia's because the simplest thing to happen is for the opponent to add a card to their hand and it even manages to be better than <a data-name=""Dark Law"">Dark Law</a> because it doesn't need to be added from the deck but of the GY as for example he trigger eff if the opponent uses the effect of <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Golden Lord</a> of summon because no one remembers but first he adds himself to the hand and then enters the field. This effect is so good that your opponent will think twice before leaving adding cards to the hand for fear of losing an important card. Amunessia's interaction effect is more powerful than Aron's but it's much easier to play around it and we don't have many decks in this format that need to summon gy monsters at the beginning of their moves before dealing with the Amunessia. The cool thing about this effect is that it combo with <em>Keurse</em> because the opponent can summon from a gy monster when Keurse enters the field (by the effect itself) so this is a way to try to force the Amunessia effect to happen but still the opponent can simply choose not to summon the GY.  Now what made me opt for Amunessia is the use of the second effect of the cards because Aron brings the advantage over Amunesia of being able to add any Ogdoadic to the hand that already pays the <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> cost at the same time you decrease the number. of bad draws in the deck having a better top deck. But the fact that Amunessia gives GY summon easily is very relevant if you want to avoid the worst part of Ogdoadic Keurse monsters and especially Aleirtt from <strong>giving free resources to the opponent</strong> and this is relevant from the point of view of having a consistent way to access Aleirtt without the opponent being able to add a monster back to the hand at the same time you return two banned monsters and can very potentially return <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> to the GY for example is something that is priceless. As you don't use Ogdoabyss, the monster you bring won't generate interaction but it already guarantees access to cards like Zeroboros in the opponent's turn with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. Another very good factor of Amunesia is the simple fact that it is a DARK attribute which is relevant if you want to summon it at the end of your play with <em>Water Lily</em>, unlike Aron, which cannot because of the restriction of Orcust monsters. I believe that Amunessia proved to be the best option to use in conjunction with Orcust.  What I find most interesting about Orcust is the fact that the gameplay is very intelligent and I think it is one of the decks that most represent modern yugioh in the way of being cyclical and never running out of gas and having effective interactions with the opponent. I don't really miss <a data-name=""Harp Horror"">Harp Horror</a> and with it the deck won't improve to the point of becoming a meta again, but it will be the ideal way to use having access to Knightmare and <a data-name=""Skeleton"">Skeleton</a> in the GY since the <a data-name=""World Wand"">World Wand</a> doesn't allow you this combination but the Harp Horror does. The fact that Harp Horror is Level 4 is also very good for this version of the deck using the Ogdoadic engine because it improves the mix of moves using <em>Nunu and Nauya</em> and the deck would have more consistency and power. Regarding Orcust card ratios at the beginning I used 3 Knightmare and 2 Skeleton and 1 <a data-name=""Crescendo"">Crescendo</a> but after testing a lot and doing probabilities I came to the conclusion that at first I never want to see 2 Knightmare in my starting hand so I only use 2 copies for decrease this chance and I also realized that whenever I opened with Skeleton in my hand, he was essentially the worst draw among the initial 5 cards, that is, he bricks my hand every time I see him and Crescendo has the conflict that I don't being able to use the Ogdoadic engine in the turn that activates its Search effect which is too costly since the Ogdoadic engine is very important in the functioning of the deck but I confess that in grind game matches I missed setting Crescendo with the <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>. If you find consistency it's something I'm looking for a lot with this deck so much that I've added <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a> which is the best Danger! to use in this deck because it is Level 4, which greatly improves Ogdoadic plays and its effect when discarded has a lot of synergy with Orcust and Ogdoadic cards and it's not crazy to use it because you already have the problem of giving free resources to the opponent with Keurse and Aleirtt so it won't be Mothman! the only villain in history to give the opponent an advantage.  In Extra Deck I have comments to make about the use of <a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a>, <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a>, <a data-name=""Sanaphond"">Sanaphond</a>, <a data-name=""Lambda"">Lambda</a>: these 4 cards are used to improve the playing options of the Ogdoadic engine because thanks to <a data-name=""Zohah"">Zohah</a> it is very easy in the Grind Game to start the turn doing Exciton Knight to force interactions from the opponent besides after using the effect you go to battle phase and do AA-Zeus in Main Phase 2 and force one more interaction. Sanaphond is a counter to the deck's own two engines and you won't be able to use any Orcurst effects on your opponent's turn when doing so but I consider it the best generic RANK-8 option to do with the Ogdoadic engine because it puts a lot of pressure on the field with an absurd atk/def stat that cannot be destroyed by effects. Lambda is very good so you guarantee you have live Gamma in your hand turn 1 and you can return the Driver to GY with Aleirtt so even if you use Gamma and it gets banned in the End Phase with Driver and Lambda trigger eff to add another Gamma from your deck you simply use Aleirtt's effect and let the Gamma live again to protect you from hand traps or interrupt the opponent. About the use of 2 <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> it turns out that you don't necessarily access the second Dingirsu with the Orcust engine but Ogdoadic does this role of the use of the second copy. Regarding <a data-name=""Longirsu"">Longirsu</a> I have to say that the LINK-3 is the worst LINK rating there is unless you are a potencial LINK-4 by nature like <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> but Longirsu when you can do it he proves to be the difference between losing and winning games.  A detail about the combos I was at the beginning testing with <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a> instead of <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a> when I made the tutorials so it turns out that you are supposed to use <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a> in the beginning before using Orcust monster effects so as I now use Amunessia it's much better to save to use Water Lily at the end of the combo. In some combos I don't even use Water Lily because I don't have 4 Reptiles with <strong>different names</strong> in the GY before I need to use the effects of Orcust monsters but that only happens if you want to summon from Ogdoabyss, at the end of the combo it's practically always possible to use the Water Lily to give Summon of Amunessia which is something I want to emphasize about tutoring.

Gizmek Orochi eff and Knightmare target Orochi send Skeleton and Skeleton eff Reborn Dingirsu and Dingirsu Attach Skeleton  Some technical play from the deck: <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> te lock in Special Summon from Reptile monster and you usually get out of lock by doing RANK-4 <a data-name=""Feral Imps"">Feral Imps</a> or tributing it to <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> for example. Forgetting this restriction costs games. <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a> only Special Summons if you have 5 Reptiles with DIFFERENT NAMES in the GY and not if you have 5 Reptiles including repeat copies. <a data-name=""Girsu,"">Girsu,</a> can only create a token on each side of the field if you don't control other monsters. Speaking of lock you on something, all Orcust cards lock you on Dark after using its effects so basically you should always summon from Nunu and Keurse before using the Orcust engine. <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi"">Gizmek Orochi</a> can only use 1 of the effects per turn, so if you want to get the most out of it you must summon it in the End Phase of your opponent's turn to be able to use the pop effect on your turn. It is not uncommon for you to LINK-4 with this deck using 4 monsters as material because Ogdoadic cards are very good at putting 2-3 monsters on the field and unless you have a <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a> or <a data-name=""Longirsu"">Longirsu</a> on the field the Orcust engine will only Give you monsters that count as Link Rating 1. A problem with this deck is the fact that when you're locked in Dark there aren't good LINK-2 options available so you end up having to do it using multiple monsters to access a LINK- 3 or LINK-4 in place.  Overall I think the deck is far from competitive even more with so much unfair in this format where all decks either use a Floodgate that says ""You won't play yugioh"" or use <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (DPE) which is a card very difficult to deal with this deck unless the opponent leaves it on the field to be sent to gy with Dingirsu which wins games alone for no reason. For sure after the next banlist this deck will be better to play at least until the arrival of <strong>Brave Token</strong> which is essentially a new engine to be abused on the same level as DPE bringing many problems to the format and making yugioh less and less fun."

The free value of the card is insane since you could in theory go +5 off it (5 tokens and 1 destruction) though this is rather unlikely and you will usually go +1 or +2 which is still insane. It can be abused to no end with dark monsters that allow you to tribute which is one of the best forms of destruction. This is one of the most unique decks and it is a load of fun to play.

Do you like violence drawing 10 cards a turn?  Well have I got the deck for you!  Remember Dragon Rulers using Super Rejuvenation to go +7 in the end phase because they were all dragons that had discard costs built in?  Like 75% of the Dragunity cards use a discard as cost. And you can play 10 Cards of Consonance targets. Which also adds a draw to your SR in end phase.  The optimal board for this deck is Spheres+Areadbhair+Dragunity Oubliette. You get there by using your discards to pack your graveyard full of Phalanx and Couse, then synchro summoning a Barcha and going off from the +3 that gives you.  It doesn't have the strongest boards but it compensates by loading your hand during the end phase, which is why the deck is 1/4 hand traps. Draw one or two and the negate (which banishes btw) and bounce should hold you through most combos, and Oubliette protects you against DRNM/Droplets.  The deck is also chock full of 1 1/2 and 2 card combos so added to the ease of getting to any of your monsters it's extremely consistent.  &nbsp;"

The idea behind the deck is that Therions are lvl 7 and 8 that allows you to go into lvl 10 and 11 synchros using your PUNKs. I usualy end on Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, a Regulus (or a Therion equipped with it), the PUNK and the Therion trap and a Sharakusai (for synchro during the opponent's turn)  The problem with Therions is that they are kinda bricky if you don't have a way to put ressources in GY first, but PUNK foxy tune is an easy and consistent way to discard a Therions from your hand and start your combos  Noh PUNK Dia Note is amazing and opens synchro 8 plays. Since it's a warrior that has a reborn effect when it leaves the field, it synergizes very well with ""Bulls"" Ein.  Overall, super nice deck, imma test it some more"

Ronin is good for OTK, but don't end your starting board on him.  If you can't get 4 monsters in GY, I'd recommend ending on Ancient Warriors as a final effort.  Searching off of Melffy of the Forest for Melffy Puppy. With Shuraig on board, this lets you get a free destroy with Kalantosa, banish off Shuraig, and negate with Forest.  Because Joyous Melffys can attack directly, you can get free Zeus off of that."

The deck is mostly rock monster based, which makes getting out Adamancipator cards to synchro summon fairly easy. Several monsters can summon each other, and the ones that can't either have good damage output or defensive capabilities. I threw in the stardust dragon synchros for backup, and also because they're some of my favorite cards. With a couple tactical-field-wipes and an enemy controller thrown in, this deck makes for a strong contender, at least among me and my friends ^^;  I had to seek out a lot of these cards on tcg, but there are a few in there that are relatively common shuffling through cards at the local card shop."

The more powerful cards can be used to protect the Melffy cards long enough to Xyz summon. There are plenty of effect cards, as well as spell/trap cards that can serve this purpose, with a particular spotlight on graveyard retrieval and attack/effect negation. Plus, even if some kind of spell, trap, or monster defense can't be immediately set up, the Melffies can defend themselves for a bit. They can be called back to avoid damage, and the nature of their effects makes collecting a hand of Melffies easy, in addition to the regular draw.  This deck was assembled from cards I've come across card hunting. That is, except the Melffy cards which were purposefully sought out, and a few cards found in the Slifer deck."

Many cards in this deck either help that happen or hamper the opponent to enable it.  Card's like Desires and Memories of Hope help you draw into things you need, Limiter Removel's for fast OTK's or Handtraps/Destruction/Mine to stall out the opponent until you can OTK. The extra deck is focused on using the one Special summon you get after using the effect of Numeron Calling to get out a good Monster that won't be easy for the opponent to deal with.  If you have a bit more $$$, I'd swap out the Dark Hole, Harpie's, and Upstart with 3x Lightning Storms."

Shut down your opponent for a turn and follow up with a <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> OTK!  Use any 2 level 4 monsters to summon <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. Ideally one of the materials should be <strong>ZS - Ascended Sage</strong> to search for <strong>The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</strong>, which will summon <strong>Kali Yuga</strong> during your opponent's turn. Set <strong>PKRUM</strong>, then enter your End Phase (to dodge <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> and <strong>Nibiru, The Primordial Being</strong>) to use Utopia Double's effect to overlay <strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragonar</strong>, then use <strong>Dragonar</strong>'s effect to summon any Dark Rank 7 Number monster. On your opponent's turn, in response to any card they activate during their Main Phase (preferably on field), you can respond with <strong>PKRUM</strong> to use your Dark Rank 7 as material to Rank-Up into <strong>D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</strong>!  <em>IMMEDIATELY </em>after his XYZ summon, even in the middle of a chain, <strong>Kali Yuga</strong> will prevent the activation of new cards on the field, AND negate any cards effects currently on the field. This prevents common board breakers like <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>, <strong>Forbidden Chalice</strong>, even <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> from activating OR resolving and essentially prevents your opponent from comboing. If your opponent tries to set up backrow like <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> you can use <strong>Kali Yuga</strong>'s effect to destroy ALL spells and traps on the field so that you can close the game next turn.  This deck excels against combo strategies (if you can go first), but struggles against control strategies. Even with the advantage of being able to destroy backrow, the opponent can simply set <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous</strong> to prevent any <span>OTK</span> (unless you fit in piercing battle damage or other rank 4s that destroy cards).  This deck also does not prevent attacks, so do not be afraid to keep your monsters in Attack Position to prevent any attempt the opponent makes to summon <strong>Divine Arsenal AA Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong> to wipe the field on your own turn (the opponent cannot attack directly with <strong>Zoodiac </strong><strong>Boarbow</strong>, remember it is negated). Your monsters are huge, 3500 and 6000 (<strong>Dragonar</strong> <span>ATK</span> is doubled off of <strong>Utopia Double</strong>), your opponent will be very hard pressed to beat over them unless they play any kind of <strong>Honest</strong>.  Another weakness this deck has is the chance that your opponent plays any form of quick-effect backrow removal, like <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> or <strong>Twin Twisters</strong>. If they attempt to remove your <strong>PKRUM</strong> before their Main Phase, you cannot summon <strong>Kali Yuga</strong>, as <strong>PKRUM</strong> can only activate during the Main Phase. Use <strong>Numbers' Protection</strong>, which is searchable off <strong>Astraltopia</strong>, to stop their attempt. Alternatively, because <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> sees plenty of play, you could play <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong> to prevent banishing for the turn, thereby protecting your <strong>PKRUM</strong>.  Change the monster line up to be any of your favorite level 4s! Change the Extra Deck to help OTK after summoning Kali Yuga! Most of the cards are really cheap, the only expensive cards are Utopia Double itself, and the hand traps and Crossout Designator. Replace these to increase consistency or fill with your own jank. Thanks for reading! Remember to feel the flow and high-five the sky!"

A assault core, B buster drake, and C crush wyvern all represent the “ABCs” of deck building with monsters, spells, and traps. A assault core represents monsters, it protects the monster it’s equipped to from monster effects, it also is the color orange to resemble the card border for monsters  B buster drake represents spells, it protects a monster it’s equipped to from spell effects and is green which is the spell card border  C crush wyvern is a trap protector and is mostly purple which is the trap border  I just put that together myself and kicked myself for not noticing a long time ago"

They can be usefull sometimes when you banish some combo pieces on desires or bricked hands with them, but your play will be a lot less deeper.

With inca engine there is sometimes you can go for Abyss + Red Wyvern, but you must choose well how to interact with your opponent. Red Reign is not searchable besides if chaos ruler can mill it nor Inca engine recycle combo, but it helps covering the interactions that extra deck can't do. You can play a second copy of Supernova as well, it's eff isn't even once per turn; FUN FACT: <a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend plays around </a><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched.</a></li> </ul> that's it.

Detach in battle phase, and double Prime Photon's already massive ATK points. <h3></h3> <h2>Going First:</h2> If going first, XYZ Summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord and Starliege Photon Blast Dragon (Preferably equipped with Photon Orbital, as this will make your board state very hard to deal with)  &nbsp; <h2>Tips:</h2> in case you fail to do OTK you can also summon C107 or Cipher Drago / Neo Cipher Drago or you can also summon them just to increase Prime Photon Dragon's ATK points."

I would make apollousa if you don't have the lost world on the board, but the destroy phoenix enforcer if you do.  <strong>Budget options:</strong> If you can not afford accesscode talker try getting cards like borrelsword dragon, it is a budget alternative.  If you can not afford the destiny hero package than I recommend just cutting the fusion package, making it a going second build with cards like dark ruler no more the rainbow neos package, and other board breaking cards. If you are just playing casually you can also cut the side deck. If you can not afford apollousa I recommend getting number 60, a second dolka, or another good generic rank 4 card for the deck. If you can not get the borreload savage dragon then I recommend changing this to a going second dino deck.  <strong>Going second dino:</strong> If you can not afford some of the more expensive cards than I recommend playing a going second variant.

The field spell is easily the best weather painter card allowing for easy access to the Rainbow painter by using your canvases as link material allowing you to use snow canvases effect to search and then using it as material in the same turn. Having cloud painter on the field at the same time as link summoning your rainbow painter will allow you to return two canvases to the field essentially turning your rainbow into a link 1. The new link 3 moonbow is an option aswell allowing you to summon your banished painters if their effect to return is negated by something like a solemn.

Perfume isn't searchable but Tri-brigades are great deck thinners and their strategy is scary. Milling alot and banishing is the main thing here. Zeus can even attach perfume and send to GY on detach. Main thing though is even if the lunalights never make an appearance, Kaleido foolishes for cost, and are good material makers for Tris. When she's banished, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects during battle phase. Marten can special summon from GY thus is good banish fodder for Shuraig. Leo is a great distraction, and a huge body. You will OTK in the right conditions with Tris clearing field. double dragon can send Imperial away if you aren't feeling it. You will need to set up GY with kaleido early to have the materials in GY for Wolf to banish. This is mostly a tri build but with a twist. Going first you want to go into apollousa with kerass special summon, make sure you fill GY. Rescue cat can summon either Joyous going first with omen as bait for banishes or Herald for negates with apollousa by special summoning Hop Ear."

The fact that most level 8's search virtually the whole archetype makes this shockingly consistent (we're talking virtually every single game).  Standard Going First Combo: <ol>  	<li>Summon Sharakusai and use its effect with the 1 other punk monster you have in hand or on field to summon Carp Rising</li>  	<li> Activate Carp Rising to summon Dia Note and Madame Spider from deck</li>  	<li>Madame Spider effect to search a Punk Trap from deck (usually Dangerous Gabu if you don't draw it)</li>  	<li>Synchro into Madame Spider and Dia Note into Dragite</li>  	<li>Dia Note effect to summon back Sharakusai in defence mode</li> </ol> End Board: <ol>  	<li>1 spell/trap negate with Dragite since Carp Rising in grave is a water (important to use Dragite because the deck has several monster negates but no spell/trap negations)</li>  	<li>Bounce 3 with Sharakusai effect by synchroing on opponents turn with Dragite to summon Amazing Dragon (bounce 3 since the combo ends with 3 level 3 tuners in grave)</li>  	<li>1 monster negate and life point gain with Dangerous Gabu</li>  	<li>3 to 4 other cards for extending into more synchros or Lambda, follow up, or additional interruptions</li> </ol> Pro Tip: If you can spare an e-tele, don't summon back the Sharakusai at the end of the combo so you can avoid Nibiru (you would be at 4 summons at that point). Then set the e-tele and use it on your opponents turn to summon another Sharakusai from deck to pull off the same 3 card bounce with Amazing Dragon.  Going second you can also bait out a lot of interruptions and still end on Amazing Dragon to equalize the game state, if not push for game with a Psychic End Punisher and something else.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You can put any 15 cards in extra decks ","Hi, this deck is built around getting on the field mystic mine (through various spells in the deck) and then drawing and searching through your entire deck through card effects. Apart from the 5 exodia pieces, the only monster is cardcar D and the deck majority is spells. Apart from mystic mine, there are other lockdown and stall cards. The extra deck's only purpose is with pot of extravagance so you could put any 15 cards you want in it. There is no side deck since this card is not very good in matches. This is my first deck uploading so I hope u enjoy :)."

The only thing different is the inclusion of crossout designator which is just here to help insure that your opening combo goes as planned, since it is crucial with only one meow meow mew.  <strong>Tips:</strong> If you are new to this deck I highly suggest you check out youtube to learn about the deck, the combo is not very straightforward and if you do not know what you are doing you will get very frustrated with this deck. Do not shuffle back the meow meow mew unless your opening combo doesn't work, the meow meow mew lets you battle butler 2 times. Reading the cards and understanding how they work will help you out a lot when learning to play any deck, prank kids is a deck that you really need to do that first with.  <strong>Budget options:</strong>If you can not afford the crossout designators, or the Triple tactics talents, then I suggest replacing them with cheaper hand traps or good cards, such as artifact lancea, twin twister, and other good cards. If you can not afford verte annoconda then that can be replaced by any good generic link monsters, such as knightmare Cerberus, A spirit charmer link monster, or even psy framegear lamda, if you are going to play the psy frame package. If you cannot afford a accesscode talker than I recomend borrelsword, or borreload dragon."
