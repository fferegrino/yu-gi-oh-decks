Some cards in extra deck, just because removing them would have been too much of an effort at 10:30 on a Wednesday. The strategy is simple, create maximum synergy with the cards given. Lots of low level warriors and beast-warriors that have more than a few duplicate buffs from the pack. These act as easily buffable fodder for the opening salvos, then eventually as fodder for some high level dragons that have their own buffs built into the deck."

Play recycler with another card in your hand for a single card combo to summon trishula. Summon recycler and send o-lion to the graveyard for the token so you can link into wyvern, use it to get out scrap golem, and use its ability to summon recycler again and send jet synchron to the graveyard. Then discard your other card to summon it and you can synchro. Alternatively if you have a level 2 monster on the field and scrap worm or golem in your graveyard already you can use recycler to get wyvern and get out scrap golem, and use it to summon the worm and synchro trishula. Sometimes you banish jet synchron, golem, or worm with pot of desires so your fallback is borrelsword and samurai destroyer or black rose dragon; real talk on a related note leanchoilia is underrated and makes it possible to win when you'd otherwise be sol, not to mention you can use it to recycle back jack and frogs for ronin summons. Get out the scum toad asap as per usual, usually you can get out opabinia and use it's ability to get another paleo on the field to summon toad, or don't. This deck has engines like an illegally modified honda civic, so you have options even if you face a set back. Just don't jump the gun with your negates or it's hut. Sometimes summoning trishula is not optimal, it's more like the icing on the cake, sometimes it's fantastic by itself but usually it's better when there's a cake already you feel me. Shrub serpent, solemn no card, and back jack package are for dealing with lightning storm and the like. if you have two shrub serpents out that get destroyed, I highly recommend you summon samurai destroyer and dupe frog, trust me on this one. My preference would be for witch's strike over shrub serpent or solemn judgement for sheer maximization of cheekiness and to punish everyone for using hand traps, but unfortunately it's bugged in ygo pro. Eria is in the side deck for when you have to deal with needlefiber or mermails. Extra deck space is tight what with all your toolbox responses, so the only knightmare is the unicorn because i had to cut compulsory evacuation device to make space for cards that don't target, since your biggest hang ups will be monsters with built in protection. It's also why quaking mirror force and evenly matched are in the side deck. Wind up snail is also in the side deck because it returns a set card to the hand, but also you can send it to the graveyard to special summon swap frog. Last but not least, if you draw both a frog and a recycler, hold onto one and use the other to bait out negations and such for smoother sailing turn two. You can throw your opponent for a lot of loops they wouldn't expect from your average paleofrog deck. If I could just play scraps and have a good time I wouldn't have had to work so hard on this."

Works best going first, however prone to hand traps and negates. Makes use of Wonder Xyz and Triverr.","<strong>Aim of deck:</strong> Summon Triverr on Opponents turn using Wonder XYZ + 3 Tellarknigth monsters.  <strong>Strategy:</strong> If you think you are chosen one by the stars, then you should try this deck!  Shock your opponent with your CDS Xyz summoning skills and Summon a Winter Constellation on their turn, freezing your opponents cards and forcing them into refuge! Then discard their unlikely Mirror Force and shutdown their meta deck!! (*not always possible)  &nbsp;  <strong><em>-Explanation:</em></strong>  Worse than Kali Yuga and Archfiend, much less consistent, but fun to see what happens :P.  Consistency is about 1/4 or 25% (not taking into account hand traps/negates). A lot of draw power cards are needed to meet the conditions to summon Triverr on opponents turn. If you get a bad hand you can summon other xyz monsters. Overall, its just a deck in progress and i will apreciate any feedback or questions.  Weak to lock/handtraps/ any meta.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Main Deck:</strong>  -Danger cards: lvl 4 for xyz, and draw power, can send juggler/ or tellarknigth monsters to GY for later revival  -Double summon, to make it easier to summon 3 tellar monsters as your hand will not always be great  - Pot of desires: - only 10 tellarknigths and you dont need most cards, so it works as draw engine  -Avarice/ Ancient Leaf/ Hand Destruction - draw  -Double or Nothing - helps against strong monsters  -Skybridge - can trick your opponent when baiting them - use  Deneb add Altair - chain this to OP effect and summon Vega, Vega summon Altair.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Extra:</strong></em>  -Dugares (Number 60): for draw power  -Bagosooka: Against locks  &nbsp;  <strong>Alternative Variants:</strong>  (not sure how these work bcoz never tried any, just ideas)  -tellar dragma artifacts  -tellar shadoll  -tellar, star seraph  - tellar synchro  Feel free to edit deck as you wish.  &nbsp;"

No you haven't since this deck is almost unplayable in a pure Chemical Strategy and has never seen the light of day unless you,"This Deck goes first. The strategy with this deck is to get VFD on the field along with either Laggia or Dolkka and if you open with the right hand, you can set up for a Bonding DHO to shotgun into Water Dragon Cluster on your opponent's turn. TLDR, monsters your opponent controls when cluster is summoned cannot activate their effects and their atk becomes 0. You can also use it to shotgun into 2 Water Dragons for a Quick Eff. You could Otk with just Cluster summon 2 Water Dragons, but he summons them in def so you have to also play thinks like All-Out Attacks or something to switch them to atk immediatedly. Water Dragon is a basically a level 8 vanilla that can float into 3 monsters when destroyed but you need to have the specific monsters in your gy to do so. It's floating eff doesn't require for it to be on the field and it doesn't miss timing so you caould destroy it with Bahrastos to get 4 bodies on the field. Water Dragon also makes all Fire and Pyro Monsters' atk become 0 but whos playing those kinds of monsters (probably pure dino but whatever)."

Full Combo is Ignister A.I.Land, Achichi @Ignister, and Pikari @Ignister. The extenders you draw into determine what plays you go with which include Balancer Lord, Micro Coder, Gatchiri @Ignister, and Doshin @Ignister. Your goal is to use A.I.Land to facilitate your plays to go into Dark Templar which summons 2 @Ignisters back from the grave when a monster is summoned to one of his arrows. The monster you want to summon here is Bururu @Ignister to one of Templar's zones so you can bring back Pikari and Achichi so that you can go into synchro and xyz plays. If you have further extenders like Succession or A.I.dle Reborn, you can go into Transcode and Fire Phoenix @Ignister. If this board survives, Link everything into Firewall Dragon Darkfluid and just straight-up destroy your opponent.

While zombies main weakness is reliance on resolving a normal summon in the form of Uni-Zombie, Shiranui Solitaire, or Gozuki. I believe the addition of a small Synchron package in the form of Tuning, Jet Synchron, and Quickdraw Synchron, as well as Crystron Halqifibrax all but remedy the renowned fragility of the zombie deck/ archetype. The typical end-board results in Zombie World, Artifact Dagda, Doomking Balerdroch (in the graveyard or on field,) and a Crystron Halqifibrax. On your opponent's turn you can activate Halqi's effect to tag out into a T.G. Wonder Magician, allowing you to destroy your own set scythe and special summon it, locking your opponent out of their extra deck. But wait! there's more! you can activate Wonder Magician's second effect allowing you to synchro on your opponent's turn using itself and Artifact Scythe into Shiranui Sunsaga, which represents an additional interruption in the form of a pop.  Here is a simple combo replay done on  Duelingbook: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=485913-20120302</a>  There are many ways that this combo can be achieved through a versatile and pretty consistent 3 card combo."

That way <strong>before</strong> you activate Neos Fusion (since Neos Fusion locks you out of SS for the remainder of the turn) you can either link them into Beat Cop from the Underworld to give Neos extra protection, overlay them into The Phantom Knights of Break Sword to destroy an opponents card (only useful if going second) or overlay them into Number 3: Cicada King for disruption.  Obviously none of that compares to playing the Numeron engine Turn 1 and then crushing your opponent from there.  &nbsp;  The Predaplant engine can also be used to search Instant Fusion to SS Thousand-Eyes Restrict to link all 3 into Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians. If there are 3 spells in the GYs or field you can then SS Thousand-Eyes Restrict from GY, link Restrict into Linkuriboh and link Selene and Linkuriboh into Accesscode Talker (or any other Link-4 that works). If you used the Numeron engine prior on your last turn you will have enough Spells for Selene's effect (Instant Fusion and Numeron Calling in GY and Numeron Network on field).  &nbsp;  Since Neos doesn't provide much interaction with your opponent the handtraps and floodgates will come in handy since There Can Be Only One doesn't stop you from summoning Rainbow Neos (it does prevent you from summoning more than 1 Numeron Gate and from using the Predaplant engine so keep that in mind)."

Unfortunately, Frogs do not have enough cards to make their own deck. There was a bit of hope in the Create-A-Card Project, but as you probably know, that did not go so well. So, until Frogs get more good cards, we are going to have to stick with the Paleozoics.  Anyways, the focus of the Paleozoics is to slowly snowball advantage, disrupting your opponent in earlier turns and summoning them back from the GY as monsters later on in the duel. When they come back as monsters, they become level 2 aqua WATER monsters, who will be banished if they leave the field. This makes them a perfect mix with Frogs, having the right type, attribute, and level, as well as being Xyz focused, allowing them to not get banished when detached as material.  One of Frog's benefits is that they can mix into practically any WATER deck. For example, if you were to open the following: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + Any WATER Monster = <strong>Coral Anemone</strong> + <strong>Toad</strong> + <strong>Dupe</strong> <ol>  	<li>Pitch your WATER Monster to Special Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>  	<li>Swap sends <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to the GY</li>  	<li>Bounce <strong>Swap</strong> back to your hand</li>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Swap</strong> sends <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> to the GY</li>  	<li>Banish <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> from GY and Special Summon <strong>Ronin</strong></li>  	<li>Link into <strong>Coral Anemone</strong></li>  	<li>Use <strong>Coral Anemone's</strong> effect, Special Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Swap</strong> sends <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> to the GY</li>  	<li>Banish <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> from GY and Special Summon <strong>Ronin</strong></li>  	<li>Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></li>  	<li>During the Opponent's Standby Phase, activate <strong>Toad's</strong> effect and Special Summon <strong>Dupe</strong></li> </ol> </li> </ul> One big flaw with Frogs is that they are weak. Their stats are too low to be taken as a threat, hence why they prefer going first, preventing your opponent from building their board. <strong>Dupe</strong> provides a solution for that. If you have 2 <strong>Dupe</strong> Frogs out, they will prevent your opponent from attacking altogether. Notice in the combo above, we never used <strong>Swap's</strong> final effect, which gives you an additional Normal Summon, as long as it is used for a Frog. If you open <strong>Swap</strong> + <strong>Dupe</strong> + Any WATER Monster, you will be able to end on <strong>Coral Anemone</strong> + <strong>Toad</strong> + 2 <strong>Dupes</strong>.  On an additional note, since the main deck does not have any WATER Monsters other than Frogs, we will always have an extra mill in the above combo. This means we can send an extra <strong>Ronin</strong> to the GY. <strong>Nibiru</strong> is a popular hand trap right now. But, just because a hand trap is good, doesn't mean everyone knows how to make the most of it. If your opponent plays <strong>Nibiru</strong> the moment you hit 5 summons, it would be at Step 9, right after you milled for the final time with <strong>Swap</strong>. Adjust the combo so that you have 2 <strong>Ronins</strong> and 1 Frog (<strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong>). If your opponent plays <strong>Nibiru</strong> right there and then, you would 2 Frogs and 2 <strong>Ronins</strong> in the GY (and a <strong>Coral Anemone</strong>, but that doesn't matter here). Banish the 2 Frogs, Special Summon both <strong>Ronins</strong>, and overlay for a <strong>Toad</strong>. Note that if your opponent is smart, they would wait for Step 10, and then they would play the <strong>Nibiru</strong>. Nothing you can do about that.  As for <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>: <ol>  	<li>Set <strong>Scapegoat</strong> during your turn.

The entire deck lives and dies by how many times you can search and special summon your 1 copy of infernity archfiend. By doing this with (mostly with necromancer) you can build massive boards full of negates and powerful like and synchro monsters to effectively win the game in a single turn. The main cards you will be using are infernity archfiend, Necromancer, Mirage and Saryuja. If everything goes to plan you will end up with a board not even a kaiju can break, else wise your deck is dead."

This will be your main problem, so having as many counters to zexal as possible is a must. Ghost ogre is extremely good to get rid of the zexal so you can go into accesscode and OTK next turn (Granted you're still alive). Zexal is extremely hard to play with, so cards like ash blossom and Infinite Impermanence really help against it. You'll also want plenty of rank 4s such as bagooska and abyss dweller to stun your opponent. Traptrix rafflesia stops handtraps, especially nibiru. You could consider running artifact sanctum and scythe, which stuns most decks, but in a salamangreat deck it really isn't necessary. Cards Like parallel eXceed are good for your rank 4 plays, and also extenders. Only 2 desires are necessary, it decreases your chance of drawing more than 1 and also removes any possible chance of you drawing 2 more desires of one. In the side the the lightning storm and evenly matched can help you immensly if you're playing against zexal. You can get rid of the zexal once it has been exhausted. Summon limit and gozen match are RIDICULOUSLY good in this format, especially against things like halqifibrax and other long combos. You are technically playing 8 gazelles in this deck, so no need to worry about not drawing one. Last but now least, 2 of the salamangreat traps are really useful. You can also search them with gazelle, but they're really good to see in your hand because they are just so disruptive."

Zexal is not as dangerous to this deck, but it is still a threat, so this deck has many cards such as Imperm, ghost ogre and evenly matched to stop the zexal. With multifaker back at 3, altergeists actually might have a competitive chance again, and here it is. Playing tons of traps is essential for altergeists, so we have evenly matched and imperial order in the main deck. Altergeists are also another deck that can play pot of extravagance, so 3 of that as well. Imperm is obviously a must, and summon limit is in the side deck because it is so powerful. Artifact sanctum and scythe also made their way into the side deck, it is so stunning against utopic zexal and also a trap. Altergeists do a lot of summoning on the opponent's turn, so zexal isn't a massive threat but still extremely dangerous. Secret village of the spellcasters is a really good side deck card, especially against numeron. Selene is a good extender as well."

Stromberg provides home for the warriors and is a 1 card Isolde while protecting them for battle. Able to,"With the falling of Linkross in OCG, it brings the Infernoble ceiling low and Stromberg provides a house for them. With both Quiet Life and Stromberg, it will be hard for opponent to break our Isolde Halq board. At the same time we also searched both BLS and Immortal Phoenix Gearfried as reinforcement because you are the king and they wont fail you.  The combo is simple, as it is just another Halq/Auroradon stuff. You just need Isolde, add Gearfried/BLS, ss Grappler Angler, make Halq, ss 001, make Auroradon, ss 001, make Arc Light (for early negation), use Auroradon tribute itself and 1 token, ss O-Lion, make Vanguard Roland and use its eff chain O-Lion, make Savage, add BLS at the end phase. You can even put them all at def position cus Stromberg is there to protect.  Stromberg is our best card and main starter, it means Glife and Terraforming are essential. Glife is also a great toolbox as it is a s/t pop and can be summoned from deck by Stromberg. Iron Hans and Knight as our main target, run 2 each as backup cus 3 are too bricky. Renaud is there as it is a plus with Living Fossil. 2 Fire Flint Lady as our best extender and it replaces Grappler Angler if we draw that tuner (Fire Flint Lady ss Grappler from hand and both have same lv1, means u wont need more equip if summoned from Isolde). Quiet Life goes along with Stromberg as floodgate (this deck doesnt run any normal summon anyway). 3 Durendal as advantage cards (you can put another good equips too, like Axe of Fools, etc.). Staples are just there cus f*** meta, man.  Extra deck is just combo pieces and generic links, play double/triple Isolde as follow up play (link climb). For side deck, Gamma is good as it kills S0 while giving us Halq or lv8 synchro.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/tEGjm1y.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Consistent combo, multiple negations, floodgate, staples, and great followup.

Chain for Bahamut Shark to activate it's effect and either special summon Number 71 to chain for Blackray Lancer or special summon Toadally.  2.) Keep Xyz summoning until you have 3 or 4 and link summon Infinitrack. Activate Infinitrack's effect and special summon 1 xyz from the GY once per turn. Infinitrack is also a really great beat stick.  &nbsp;  Note: If you want lots of Xyz monsters on the field special summon Xyz Remora. ;)

The Kaiba experience,"IMO the strongest possible deck using fusion and the Blue-Eyes package.  <hr />  Combos:  Summon maiden with eyes of blue, activate sage with eyes of blue -&gt; two blue eyes on the field (for an XYZ)  Dragon shrine-&gt; mill a dragon spirit of white (counts as a normal monster so you get another discard)  -&gt; Then mill either: white stone of legend (summon a blue-eyes in your END phase)  OR a Kidmodo dragon (skip your BATTLE phase but special summon a dragon from your hand).  <hr />  Future fusion:  Reveal ""Five-headed dragon"" to mill 5 different dragons (more dragons in your GY are preferred for Dragon Mirror, also lets you activate GY effects).  Dragon mirror should be used for a Blue-Eyes ultimate dragon based on situation (2 available):  -Alternative ultimate dragon: Lets you destroy 3 enemy cards if you used an alternative blue eyes as material  -Neo alternative ultimate dragon: Lets you attack 3 times with 4500 atk if this is the only card you control  <hr />  XYZ guide:  Nr 97 Draglubion can SS any of the other ""number"" monsters with 1 material (giving you two dragon XYZ monsters for the price of one). This is generally the best XYZ play. The best choice for each situation is:  -Nr 100: Numeron Dragon- Will have at least 9000 attack, and 8000 more if you have any XYZ dragons other than Nr 97 out. Pick this if enemy has allowed an OTK state.  -Nr 38: Hope Harbringer- Negate 1 spell/trap  -Nr 107: Galaxy-Eyes- Change all monsters to their original atk/def  -Nr C107- Tribute 2 monsters to be able to attack 3 enemy monsters (the least useful effect- 4500 atk beatstick)  The other XYZ dragons should be used situationally, eg ""Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis"" can be used to blow up backrow  NOTE: Thunder End Dragon can only use 2 normal dragons as material (must be Blue-Eyes white dragon)  <hr />  This deck can grind, using Deep-Eyes to remove enemy monsters and Dragon Spirit to banish spells/traps.  The overall power-level of this deck is tied to the power level of the fusion cards. If you want to take the focus away from fusion (and make this deck more competitive), cut future-fusion for imperm. This deck is not meta, but it is very consistent and fun to play."

Even though you can't go in to your battle phase when your going first you can set up a nice bored with this card.</span></li>  	<li><span>Battlin Boxer <span>Switchitter</span> <span> : <span>While not being no where near as good as <span>Sparrer</span>, <span>Switchitter</span> Can still be very use full. <span>Switchitter</span> has the effect that if you have a <span>Battlin Boxer</span> in the graveyard you can special summon it to your side of the field. This card paired up with Foolish Burial  can get you to your best card<span> Isolde</span>. (More About Her Later) Those are the 2 best <span>Battlin Boxer</span>, now on to important extenders </span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span>Blue Mountain Butterspy</span> : This Combo extender can help push you to make <span>Isolde</span>. Whit it's special summon effect from hand when you normal summon a warrior can make this the best extender if you don't open up  <span>Sparrer<span>. </span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span>Junk Forword <span>: The last crucial piece of the deck is none other than <span>Junk Forword<span>. This card is the first card you put on the field if you open it, why you might ask? It's effect states that is you have no monsters on your field special summon this card. That's it, that's why it's the best starter. </span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span>Isolde<span> : By far the best card in your deck. If you can make this card it's like drawing Exodia, YOU WIN. Nah, but on a real note this is the main card this card is the Heart And Soul of this deck, and it won't be a warrior deck without <span>Isolde<span>. This making this card Confirms that you can get<span> Borreload Savge Dragon</span> and <span>Trishula The Ice Barrier Dragon<span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span> Crystron Halqifibrax <span>: The most Annoying, Degenerate, Hated card in this current format is of course played in this deck. The Deck would not be any good without this card. It allows this deck to at least compare to some decks. Now that you know the Key Cards in this deck  it's tie for the combo. </span></span></li> </ol> <p><span><span>Combo Time</span></span></p> <p><span><span>Make Isolde, (Any Way Doesn't Matter)</span> <span>Isolde Effect To Send 4 Equip Spells to Grave, And Special Summon Rose, Warrior Of Revenge. </span></span><span>Next Link Isolde Into Linkross And Summon 2 Tokens.

It's a body and a negate and you can make it so yea. 1 <strong>Unchained Abomination</strong> for removal. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong> which negates all banished effects and it also a potentially 2 negates per turn. <strong>Union Carrier</strong> to equip <strong>Mezuki</strong>. <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> to summon <strong>Bloom</strong>. <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> for draw power and tribute summoning <strong>Doomking</strong> LULW. <strong>Avendread Savior</strong> for grave set-up which is sent as cost. <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> to get <strong>Bloom</strong> into the grave.  Side Deck: 2 <strong>Kasha</strong> for shuffling your opponent's board into the deck. 3 <strong>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</strong> since it triggers <strong>Doomking</strong>. 3 <strong>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story</strong> to get out <strong>Solitaire</strong>. 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> for more removal. 3 <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> which works well with<strong> Zombie World</strong>.  <strong>Draculea Vampire</strong> is bad end of story."

Goal is to use Isolde to start Needlefibre combos that end on Apollousa or Mechaba while searching you Faris and a HERO monster for its effect. This makes Vyon into a back-up starter, which can go into Isolde through either Malicious, or Sunrise. Fire Flint Lady improves this by being full combo with Stratos, while also letting you search Mask Change by searching and summoning Shadow Mist. Armageddon Knight is full combo by itself, sending Mally, then Shadow Mist after Cross-Sheep summons it. Dark Rose fairy is a free Extender during the combo, but is here to facilitate Arma Knight combos when you see your other bricks, reducing the number of hands that brick out. Extra Deck is all about turboing out your negate(s) and then using HERO and fusion spells to top off your board. Flame Swordsman into Cross Crusader bridges the gap between Cross-Sheep and Wonder Driver, which is useful for resetting Mask Change. Flame Swordsman can also be decent to end on in this deck in low-end boards, since it has a good floating effect, while having Cross Crusader gives you back-up HERO plays you can make when you are forced to Faris early."

You feeling lucky?,"This is my variant of the Cubic Deck, I really don't like the Summoner Monk version of this deck so I decided to make an OTK variant with a twist, instead of playing a version that takes advantage of new cards like Pot of Extravagance and Pot of Desires, I feel I kicked the luck of this deck up to an eleven as I ditched those cards for Cup Of Ace, it adds a bit of a twist because it leaves the outcome to a coin toss that I believe most players wouldn't say no to, this card is essentially a Pot of Greed with a  50% chance your opponent draws instead if you're lucky you might be able to go through an entire duel  without them  drawing at all and I like  the added  challenge it provides"

First Triamids have field spells that gain value from being sent from the field to the Graveyard; cards like <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> provides an extra way to pop your field spells. Both Archetype also have some mutually beneficial cards such as <a data-name=""Magicians’ Souls"">Magicians’ Souls</a>, which lets you cycle spell cards with grave effects, and <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>, which lets you set up powerful locks with the barrier statues.  <span><strong>How does the deck Play?</strong></span>  The Evil Eye Half of the deck is played very similarly to the popular Invoked engine. Using the field spell: <a data-name=""Evil Eye Domain – Pareidolla"">Evil Eye Domain – Pareidolla</a> to search <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> to search either <a data-name=""Evil Eye of Selene"">Evil Eye of Selene</a> for a special summon destruction or <a data-name=""Evil Eye Retribution"">Evil Eye Retribution</a> for a spell/trap negate. On top of this the Triamid field spells primarily <a data-name=""Triamid Cruiser"">Triamid Cruiser</a> can be played over and destroyed to either search for or summon <a data-name=""Triamid Sphinx"">Triamid Sphinx</a>. Sphinx helps enable OTKs that would be very hard to come by otherwise.  The strongest combo in the deck is using <a data-name=""Ties of the brethren"">Ties of the brethren</a> on either Serziel or on of the Level 4 rock earth monsters. This summons fantastic stun cards directly from the deck.  For <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> summon <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abyss"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> and <a data-name=""Hand-Holding Genie"">Hand-Holding Genie</a> in defense position. <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abyss"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> stops most decks from special summoning and <a data-name=""Hand-Holding Genie"">Hand-Holding Genie</a> gives all of your monster’s battle protection by forcing your opponent to only be able to attack a 2600 defense or more monster. For a level 4 rock earth monster summon <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a> and <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a>, However Koa’ki Meiru’s and <a data-name=""Triamid Master"">Triamid Master</a> provide other niche options. Fossil Dyna stops all special summoning and <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a> stops an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> from negating Fossil Dyna’s effect along with other good stun effects. Something worth mentioning is that the Triamid field spells boost attack and defense of rock type monsters, this helps make your stun monsters harder to kill by battle, which is one of their infamous weaknesses. I’ll also say that <a data-name=""Holding Arms"">Holding Arms</a> and <a data-name=""Holding Legs"">Holding Legs</a> are to interesting targets for Ties of the brethren that can be sided in depending on the match up.  <span><strong>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</strong></span>  Consistency is probably the biggest weakness of the deck. Even with fantastic cards like <a data-name=""Magicians’ souls"">Magicians’ souls</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> its never going to be a perfectly consistent deck.  <span><strong>What to do Going Second?</strong></span>  This deck has some fun options going second. Not only do you have <a data-name=""Triamid sphinx"">Triamid sphinx</a> to help OTk’s, the deck easily can side in <a data-name=""Fossil Fusion"">Fossil Fusion</a> to summon the Fossil extra deck. <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> are obvious helps to going second. I suggest siding out Stun cards like <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a> and the barrier statues as well as <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>.  &nbsp;  Credit to: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/hoden/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/author/hoden/</a>  for giving me this idea"

There are some optimizations that can be made to this list, but I wanted to put out a list using only cards I have, and honestly, this deck is really solid. I have done 200+ test hands, and at least 2/3 of them have ended with 3 interruptions. I also own Bagooska and Abyss Dweller, so please let me know if either of those should replace Tornado Dragon.

Going 2nd:  Proc all of your effects before activating Numeron Network.

This deck revolves around this card :).  You need as many draws and searches to get mystic mine as possible. We have the terraforming, duality, extravagance, left arm offering and metaverse. These are all good cards for getting to your mystic mine.  Obviously a win condition is needed, so we have 3 cauldrons, a wave motion and a final countdown.  Silent Wobby is a card that you can put on your opponent's field in order to keep your mystic  mine alive.  Some other good cards are: Goddess skuld's oracle: This card lets you sort your opponents deck! Field barrier: Stops mystic mine from being destroyed. Prohibition: Stops any 1 card from being used for the entire duel. Solemn Strike and Dark bribe: NEGATE Mystic mine: duh"

Requires 2 bricks in the extra deck and only makes Savage if you see 1 extender, but you reliably do make Apollousa + Winda + Savage.  Changed Qadshaddol Keios for Shaddoll Beast. If you leave the Union Carrier on the table and destroy Beast with Tracer's effect you draw a card! You can also still clear the Carrier and forgo the draw. This works because you don't use Verte Anaconda until after you make Borrelsword. Yay free draw.  Upped the card count to increase the odds of seeing hand traps, and increased extenders accordingly."

Also added card trader, since some cards will not allow you to continue drawing later, having more than one in the hand at the time, can be detrimental, so card trader fixes that, hope you guys like it.

Reggarding the Sacred Beasts package, this deck doesn't play Uria at all, as it makes it less competitive. The main beaters/win conditions are of course Hamon and Raviel, played at 2 each of them because drawing 1 is always nice for starting your combos to summon them and to have several copies to respond if they are destroyed or banished. Not much to explain about the ratios of Beckoning and Summoning beasts but remark that the Dark Summoning Beast is played at 2 because it might be a brick if drawn alone without any of the other ones, so I decided to cut it to 2. Necessary the Seven Gates at 3 and the Fallen paradise at 2 (as it is searcheable by the effects of many cards of the archetype).  This profile also includes 2 copies of Effect Veiler, for slowing down your opponent combos or stop monster effects that could remove your sacred beasts from your field/game if fallen paradise isn't active. I also play 1 copy of the <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair as it is an incredible tech for a deck based in sacrifying dark monsters to summon your main boss monsters (Raviel and Hamon), it cannot be tributed nor targeted by card effects (nice protection) and it comes back from the graveyard each time you tribute a dark monster.</a>  Reggarding the spells played in the deck, the Pots are the best solution to the consistency problem of the deck which, in my opinion, is the main problem this deck has and playing both at 3 it is quite fixed. Foolish Burial at 1, as it can help you to start the combo for summoning the Sacred Beasts at mid-late game if you send the proper monster to the graveyard. Finally, reggarding the spells, something that must be always played in decks that aim to compete against meta strategies is 2xMystic mine + 1x Set rotation... I mean, you won't understand how helpful this is until you play it. If your field is cleaned and you need time to recover yourself to start again with the combos for summoning Hamon and Raviel, the mystic mine is your best ally.  To end with the main deck, you play 3 copies of the Awakening of the Sacred Beast, card that in the field, together with any Sacred beast will give you a lot advantage + life points recovery. Furthermore you play some techs in order to take control of the game such as Crackdown at 3, completely necessary in a deck which might have problems to summon monsters if combos are stopped, so you can protect yourself from direct attacks by takig your opponent big monsters. I have also decided to play There can be only one at 3 because it is the best card to compete against the meta nowadays and it doesn't enter in conflict with your main win condition which is having Hamon and Raviel on the field (there's no conflict with Diabolos either). Finally you play a copy of Skill Drain, because once your sacred beasts are summoned and protected by the fallen paradise, this card will almost lock your opponent out of the game.  Finally I want to remark that you might think that some cards such as Mystic Mine, There can Be Only One or Skill Drain might enter in conflict with your own strategy, but you must remember always something: You decide when to play your own cards, not your opponent.

The four-star XYZ cards are interchangeable and easy to summon, if you pull the seventh on turn one number 99 will mitigate the poo of that, he also makes it easier for that occasional cxyz. There are too many great rank 8s, I like these. I don't much care for bringing out Cyber Dragon, so It isn't in here. It's a great card tho. Anyway, galaxy soldier is purely a search, it can be used as fodder for the single link card or be fodder for Hyper Galaxy etc combos expedition. The link card is great support all around, Gives you a card and whatnot, advances plays, disrupts etc. But the xyzs are better, that's why I only have 1.  Numeral hunter is disgusting and works well in this deck for one reason: occasionally your broken galaxy xyz gets stolen. Or maybe someone brings out something like Zexel.  Anyway, it's simple. Have fun.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The deck's name is a parody of ""Stairway to Heaven"", a song by Led Zeppelin.  &nbsp;  Negalogia AA-Zeus is broken already, but it is one of the best tech choices that Trains can have, and not just due to its spot removal. For one, if your opponent survives getting attacked with Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe, you're gonna want to use it to summon this card. Otherwise, you're just leaving a large beatstick out with no protection or disruptions.  &nbsp;  As for its nuking effect, if you use it and send Urgent Schedule to the Graveyard while it's Set, you can use Urgent Schedule's floating effect to search a Level 10 Machine. Similarly, if Super Express Bullet Train is sent to the Graveyard, whether by being detached from AA-Zeus or by its effect, Bullet Train's effect can add a Machine from your Graveyard to your hand.  &nbsp;  And I'm not gonna lie.

The main strategy of this deck is to get Madam Verre and Haine on the board, and shut down your opponents plays.  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  Big Witches - The bosses of the deck, you'll be sitting on these for most of the game. Discards a spell to activate their effects. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Madam Verre - Not only used to beef up your other Witches, she can also negate the effects of all monsters face up on the field. Probably the best Witch in the deck.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Haine - Makes other Witches untargetable, and can pop a card on the field. The second best Witch in the deck</li> </ol> Baby Witches - These witches can tribute themselves and discard a spell to summon another Witch from the deck. Normally a Big Witch, but they can special each other too. You want to see these in your opening hand most often. They also all have unique grave effects. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Schmietta (3x) - Easily the best Baby Witch. Best stats out of all the others, and more importantly, her grave effect allows you to send a Witchcrafter card from your deck to the grave.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Pittore (2x) - Her grave effect allows you to draw a card, and the discard isn't usually a big deal since your spells add themselves back to your hand. Also used to dump your other Baby Witches.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Potterie - Used mostly when you're running out of steam, her grave effect only works when you have no cards in your hand. Allows you to add a Witch from your grave to your hand, most often a Baby Witch.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Genni (2x) - The second best Baby Witch, her grave effect allows her to banish a Witchcrafter spell and copy its effect. Allows you to use the same spell effect multiple times in one turn.</li> </ol> Other - <ol>  	<li>Ash Blossom (3x) - Pretty self explanitory, can be replaced pretty easily with Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence (I'd totally run this if I could afford it). We run a reasoning, and Ash Blossom is an awkward summon off of that, but otherwise insanely good.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong>Spell/Traps</strong>  Witchcrafter Spell/Traps - All Witchcrafter Spells (minus Bystreet) share the same effect - adding itself from your grave to your hand if you haven't activated its effect this turn. Bystreet and Patronus have different effects, but still do things in the grave. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Creation (3x) - Searches a Witch from your deck. Usually used to fetch a Baby Witch, however can also be used with Unveiling to summon a Big Witch. Pretty self explanitory.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Holiday (3x) - Monster Reborn for Witches. Also pretty self explanatory, we only run one copy of each Big Witch, so this is used to bring them back.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Unveiling (3x) - Specials a Witch from your hand, and stops your opponent from activating anything in response to spellcaster effects. The second effect is relevant since its a quick play spell, making your opponent unable to interrupt your effects on their turn. If you decide to run Effect Veiler, they cannot chain Called by the Grave to its activation after you play this card, which sometimes comes up.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Draping - Bounces spell/traps, quite useful when pushing for game.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Collaboration - Allows a Witch to attack twice, as well as stopping spell/trap effects until the end of damage step. When combined with Madame Verre's attack boost, this can deal absurd damage.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Bystreet - The only continuous Witchcrafter spell we run, and protects your Witches from destruction. Can be send from the field to the grave to activate any of the discarding effects, and places itself back on the field during the end phase. You'll be dumping this with Schmietta quite often.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Patronus - Used to recycle Witches, and search other spells. Its grave effect allows you to add any of your banished spells from Genni/any of your opponents effects.</li> </ol> Other spells - <ol>  	<li>Reasoning - All of the Witches are different levels, meaning you normally get a free summon off this card. We run a low monster count and a high spell count, as well as your Witch spells adding themselves to your hand in the end phase, meaning this card is perfect for this deck.</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial - Used to dump Baby Witches, normally Schmietta, so you can use their grave effects.</li>  	<li>Metalfoes Fusion - You'll find yourself discarding your spells often, making this card a free draw.</li>  	<li>Monster Reborn - Self explanatory</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave (3x) - Also self explanatory, used to stop any hand traps/grave effects your opponent uses.</li>  	<li>Instant Fusion - Used to summon Thousand-Eyes Restrict for removal, Millennium-Eyes Restrict to stop any hand traps/effects on your turn, and rarely Winda to stop any special summoning.</li>  	<li>Magician's Restage - Can be used as a Monster Reborn for most of your Baby Witches, but is a little hard to get off the field. If you discard this for any of your Witches effects, it searches one of the Magician's Hands.</li>  	<li>Magician's Left/Right Hand - The Left Hand negates the first trap that activates, and the Right hand negates the first Spell. I've found the Right Hand to be better normally, but having both on the field can be a nightmare for your opponent.</li> </ol> <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Honestly, the Extra Deck doesn't matter too much in this deck. Winda and the Restrict fusions are there for Instant Fusion, and the Selene/Accesscode Talker combo is strong.

At the same time Ancient Cloak, Silent Boots","My favorite character archetype empowered with Sacred Beast engine makes it super viable because it's a 1 card Curious Lightsworn which is Beatrice+Dante combined, although we dont need the Dante effect lol. Combo: <a>https://bit.ly/305LVHz</a>  All we need is <strong>1 Sacred Beast engine (Dark Beckoning/Spirit Gates) + 1 random PK</strong>. After having Dark Beckoning + Chaos Summoning on field, make Linkuriboh, use Spirit gates discard PK ss Chaos Summoning, make Relinquished Anima, make Curious dump PK (Tear Scale/Ancient Cloak, depends on what u need), use Ancient Cloak add Silent Boots, ss Tear Scale from GY, use Tear Scale discard 1 card dump Ragged Glove, ss Silent Boots, make Leviair, use Leviair detach Silent Boots ss Ancient Cloak, use Ragged Glove dump Fog Blade, use Fog Blade ss Silent Boots, make 2nd Leviair, use Leviair ss Ragged Glove, make Apollousa using Curious+Ragged Glove, make F0 using 2 Leviair, use Silent Boots add Fog Blade.  Pay attention to what PK we have in hand and GY, cus all is hopt and <strong>dont overdump/overextend our resource</strong>. Going second you can Accesscode (replacing Apollousa) + F0 for OTK. The card ratio is explainable, 3 Tear Scale (starter, combo piece, extender, best card), 3 Silent Boots (best extender, Fog Blade grind game), 2-3 Ancient Cloak (combo pieces, grind game, but bad starter), 1-2 Ragged Glove (extra copy of any PK, but bad starter), Stained Greave (worst PK, consider to cut it out), 3 Fog Blade (negate atk and eff, revives PK). I dont play the Rank-Up-Magic as it is slow and we have Accesscode which is better for OTK/wiping board. The Break Sword lineup is perfect cus it revives 2 and you can either follow it up with Raiders' Knight (for more Break Sword) or Knightmare Unicorn/Accesscode.  Sacred Beast engine is standard, 3 Dark Beckoning, 3 Spirit Gates, 1 Chaos Summoning. Just draw either 1 of Dark Beckoning or Spirit Gates and it's GG. All the staples are depending on matchup (Numeron Eldlich I'm looking at you) while being lv3 for rank3 synergy. Bammboozling is there for early negation or if we run out of resource, kinda better than Number 3: Cicada King cus Cicada doesnt negate handtrap. Borreload as another good dark link for non-targeting/destruction.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/pIZiwmx.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Salamangreat strong level, multiple negations, big monster, can OTK, super recursive, and big staple slot.  Cons: Only has monster negation.  <img src=""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w6VmtiK__Rk/maxresdefault.jpg"" alt=""image"" />"

All its monsters pop out of your hand to play during the End Phase, and then jump back to the hand when frightened by attacks or summoned monsters, in order to call out more friends.  Unassuming at first, and seemingly an advantage engine without any way to capitalize off it... but under the surface, Melffy decks are a high-execution deck capable of controlling and wiping boards, playing a huge variety of different monsters, and taking advantage of Synchro, Xyz, and Link alike! Let's get into it and see just what they're capable of!  (Note: This is not a tier 1 deck, but I've endeavoured over the last few months to experiment with assorted Melffy builds, and I can guarantee you that this is probably one of the most powerful variants you'll find on here!)  <strong>Table Of Contents: </strong> <ol>  	<li><em>Melffy and You - A Guide To Your In-House Cards</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and Toolboxing - A Guide To Basic Control</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and the Extra Deck - A Guide to Closing Out Games</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and Variation - A Guide To Options And Side-Decking</em></li>  	<li><em>Final Notes</em></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and You -- A Guide To Your In-House Cards --</span></strong>  Melffy, as of now, is a deck composed of five Main Deck monsters (of which one is a vanilla), three Xyz Monsters, two spells, and a trap. This isn't the largest of archetypes, but with the consistency its two most important main deck monsters allow, it doesn't have to be. Let's take a look at them!  All main deck Melffy save Rabby (their vanilla) are <strong>LV2 EARTH Beasts</strong> (with nary any ATK or DEF) that share the same two effects, with hard Once Per Turn limits on each: During your End Phase, you can summon them from your hand, and when your opponent Summons a monster or declares an attack while you have Melffy on board, you can return them to your hand to do a certain effect. <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> is the strongest, <em>summoning from deck any Level 2 Beast</em>, including any of your other Melffy! Run three copies and never look back.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Cathy </strong>comes in second, <em>searching any Beast from deck.</em> Not just level 2 - ANY Beast. This allows for some very funny plays, as we'll look at later. You can argue anywhere from 1 to 3 copies of this, but I prefer to play 2-3.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Pony</strong> and <strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> are tied for the lesser of the four, respectively <em>getting a Level 2 beast from grave to hand</em> or <em>Special Summoning a beast from hand.</em> We run one of each, for toolbox utility - with Melffy Puppy, you only really need one.</li> </ul> Next up, a look at their Extra Deck friends... or at least, the ones that have ""Melffy"" in the name. Melffy have a <strong>lot</strong> of viable ED picks, as you'll see very soon... <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> is their flagship Xyz, allowing an <strong>inhouse omnisearcher once per turn</strong> (that can also grab backrow!), as well as a<strong> clunky but powerful Fiendish Chain when you bounce a Melffy back to hand.</strong> This can't stop on-summon effects like a Halqifibrax or Conquistador activation, but it can lock down almost any other monster! Run 1-3.</li>  	<li><strong>Excited Melffy </strong>(translation not official) is their newest piece of support, and at 2000 ATK their only real in-house attacker. Its first effect, <strong>being able to detach a material to grant Melffy direct attacks,</strong> is mostly useless given the archetype's low statline, but it's got a niche usage of setting up <strong>Negalogia AA-Zeus</strong> plays (more on this later). Its second effect, however, is far more important - being able to <strong>bounce a Melffy Xyz back to the Extra Deck to revive Melffy up to its materials! </strong>The full use of this ability will be discussed in full a bit later, but keep it in mind for now. Run 1, I'd say.</li>  	<li>And, uh... <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> is bad. Sorry, but she's just not good! At 2 materials she's a 1000 atk waste of space, and if you get her up to 5 materials you get... a worse Yubel. Which was a card released in 2007/2008. Run 0.</li> </ul> Finally, let's look at their in-house backrow! <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Tag</strong> is a <em>quick-play, archetype-locked Monster Reborn.</em> This allows for a searchable revive at any time, even of your Xyz Monsters - and sets up a one-card <strong>Utopic Future Dragon</strong> play, as will be discussed later. It also allows for Zeroboros interaction, extra material, and simply getting your Puppy or Cathy back on the board when you need them. Run however many you wish, but I lean towards 2.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Hide-And-Seek</strong> is a rather unique continuous spell. <em>It grants all of your beasts protection from effect destruction once per turn</em>, and also lets you <em>shuffle three beasts from grave to deck once per turn to draw a card.</em> Against decks that can't threaten your backrow efficiently, Hide-And-Seek (which I'll refer to as HAS) can <strong>constantly shuffle your Rescue Cats and garnets back into deck while gaining you advantage</strong> - and against decks that can, you can still just search it out to essentially turn Melffy of the Forest's effect into a recycle and a draw. Run any amount - some decks run 0, others run 3, I personally run 2.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Time</strong> is their only trap, and lets them remove materials from an Xyz to bounce to hand other cards on the field, as well as granting that Xyz 500 ATK for each during that turn only. It's... well, it's not good. At 1 material (such as with a Forest that's used its effect already), it's a 1-for-1 that only bounces to hand. Given this is a trap, it's inherently slow and prone to destruction, and the ATK boost will never matter since it's miniscule and you're probably using this on your foe's turn. Run 0 - you have far better disruption choices.</li> </ul> So that's all the Melffy. Now, the part you've been waiting for - <em>how do I use these?</em>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and Toolboxing -- A Guide to Basic Control --</span></strong>  The bread and butter of the Melffy archetype is making <strong>simple boards with a ton of recursion and disruption,</strong> locking the opponent out and then beating them down in the grind game. They function best going first, though they can also work going second if they need to. To understand the potential of Melffy, we first have to take a look at what their two ace main deck monsters - Puppy and Cathy - can grab. So let's do that!  <strong>-Puppy's Pals-</strong> are few, but crucial. <ul>  	<li><strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> is Puppy's best friend. <strong>When it's summoned by a beast, you can pop a card on the field.</strong> Yes, that's all it does - simple, reliable, on-summon removal. Time your Kalantosa summon just right, and you can nip your opponent's combo in the bud - have a Melffy of the Forest on the field, and you can negate a second monster along with it! Plus, you can use the Kalantosa for summons later. Run at least 1, but numbers vary - do you want to run multiple and potentially clog up your hand, or do you want to run 1 and risk it being banished or otherwise unavailable? Personally, I run 2.</li>  	<li><strong>All of the other Melffy</strong> can be searched, and then proceed to fire their own effects the next time an opponent summons. This is great if your Kalantosas are locked in your hand and you need Fenny, or if you need Pony to grab something important from the grave.</li>  	<li><strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong>is a tuner that can also discard dead cards in hand to revive beasts, letting you go into a Melffy Xyz or a level 4 synchro. It's not as useful on the opponent's turn, but if you manage to trigger Puppy during your turn, it can be smart.</li>  	<li>Finally, if you don't need any of them, <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> can summon a second copy of itself from hand or grave when it hits the field, granting you extra material. It's very useful as a combo extender for other reasons, as we'll talk about later. I like running two of these.</li> </ul> <strong>-Cathy's Comrades-,</strong> not limited by the Level 2 restriction Puppy has, are far more numerous, to the point where choosing which to search smartly can separate victory from defeat. <ul>  	<li><strong>Rescue Cat</strong> is an absurdly powerful searcher (albeit one that takes up your normal summon), and can act as a searchable one-card setup for multiple monsters. You can even recycle it with HAS later to do it all over again! Run threeeee.</li>  	<li>But if you're looking for something more immediately useful, <strong>Hop-Ear Squadron</strong> can use itself from hand and a Beast on field to Accel Synchro during your opponent's turn, letting you immediately transform that Kalantosa on board into a <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>for massive disruption.</li>  	<li><strong>Danger! Bigfoot!</strong> is a thoroughly amusing option. Melffy can have trouble putting BIG NUMBER on the board and making spot removal besides Kalantosa, so having a way to cover both of those, get garnets out of hand, gain material, and cycle through your deck all in one is fantastic. Run 0-3, it's really up to you and can vary based on what Melffy variant you're running.</li>  	<li><strong>Valerifawn</strong> is an option, but is typically outclassed by Rescue Cat.</li>  	<li>Once again, <strong>any other</strong> <strong>Melffy </strong>can also be searched, so if you have Cathy and really, <em>really</em> need Puppy, you can do that. Or just get it through Forest instead.</li> </ul> With Puppy and Cathy on board, you can easily pivot into destruction, negates, prep for your next turn... they're the dynamic duo of the deck, but they're not enough by themselves. How do you get them on board reliably? How do you make a board besides them?  Let's take a look at our summoning suite and how to use them. <ul>  	<li><strong>Rescue Cat</strong> we've already talked about, but a closer dive into it is important. It's searchable, has little to no limitations, and can make on the spot anything from a Naturia Beast to a Utopic Future Dragon based on the situation. In order to make the most out of it, we run two level 3 semi-garnets - <strong>Peropero Cerperus</strong>, which is a destruction enabler while in grave, and more importantly <strong>Mine Mole, </strong>which gives you a free draw whenever you perform a Synchro Summon with it. This makes Rescue Cat plus out of its mind.</li>  	<li><strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> is a lot more spicy. You need to have no monsters on field to use it, and it only gets level 2s, and it locks you into only Beast monsters from the Extra Deck... but in return, it doesn't take up your Normal Summon, and gets you three monsters. You'll typically want to grab <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> so as to get one into your graveyard (or get 4 for the price of 3 if you have one in grave already), but the other two monsters you summon are up to you. <ul>  	<li><strong>Notably, with both Obedience Schooled and Rescue Cat, the effects of the monsters you summon are negated, and they die at the End Phase.</strong> This has some unique and not readily apparent synergies with HAS and Excited Melffy - the first will protect all of them from that destruction, letting you keep them on board for later material.. and the latter you can make using whatever you summoned and then convert it into the Melffy you summoned during the next turn, <strong>with their effects back</strong>! This can be a nasty surprise for enemies not expecting you to drop Puppy and Cathy onto your board out of nowhere!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> is the odd summon out. By targeting a Level 2 EARTH Beast, you can get two more from your deck... but at the cost of 2000 LP and locking you out of Special Summoning for the rest of your turn. It's an ideal way to end your combos - after doing everything you wanted, target a piece of material on board and drop two Melffy directly from deck, ready to plus you all the way to a victory the next turn.</li>  	<li>We've mentioned <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> a lot so far, so it's worth going over momentarily - when it's summoned, you get to summon another Baby Tiger from hand or graveyard. If you set one up in the grave with one of the above cards early, every time you summon it again you'll gain free material, letting you extend your combos beyond what Melffy would normally be limited to.</li> </ul> As you can see, this gives your deck a lot of summon flexibility. This variant of the deck runs 3 Obedience, 3 Cat, and 2 Ties, all but guaranteeing you'll see a few of them in your opening hand. You can open with Obedienced... then if your opponent negates it, fire off another one, or maybe a Rescue Cat, keeping the pressure on any deck that doesn't create a million negates.  Now that you've seen how Melffy can keep control of the board, why don't we look at... their Extra Deck options?  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and the Extra Deck -- A Guide on Closing Out Games --</span></strong>  I will level with you - Melffy have a TON of Extra Deck options. Between Synchro, Xyz, and Link, many doors are open to them, and their toolboxing nature wants them to keep as many of those doors open as possible, so there's a lot of room for variation. But we'll go over the picks that this deck runs, in order to get a look at how the deck plays. Also worth noting is that Obedience Schooled locks you out of anything but Beasts if it resolves, so if you've used it this turn, you'll have to make a board of the Melffy Xyz and perhaps a Missus Radiant, Sandayu, or Naturia synchro. Keep that in mind!  We'll start with the most important facet of their extra deck, and their main way to finish games with a bang: their two big non-Melffy Xyz Monsters!  <strong><span>-- The Xyz --</span></strong>  <strong>Number F0:</strong> <strong>Utopic Future</strong> and <strong>Utopic Future Dragon </strong>have been mentioned a few times during this guide, and for good reason. You can make them of any two non-Number Xyz of the same rank (so, your Melffy Xyz), and each has a powerful effect. <em>Utopic Future takes control of monsters it attacks during the battle phase,</em> letting you steal lethal if the opponent's trying to sit on one BIG monster, but the more notable one is Utopic Future Dragon - an <strong>indestructible 3000 ATK beater </strong><strong>that can negate any monster effect... and then STEAL that monster,</strong> if it was on the opponent's board!  Summoning these in this deck becomes immensely simple if you have a copy of Excited Melffy or Melffy of the Forest in the Graveyard. Simply summon Rescue Cat (or Baby Tiger if you already have one in the graveyard), granting you the two material for Melffy of the Forest. Use its effect to search a copy of Melffy Tag, reviving the other Xyz from the graveyard. You only used one card from hand, and you now have all the material you need to summon your Future Dragon!  --  If Utopic Future Dragon was the big bad payoff for Forest, <strong>Negalogia AA-Zeus</strong> is the payoff for Excited Melffy. You can summon it using an Xyz Monster if you attacked with an Xyz Monster that turn... and oh, would you look at that, Excited Melffy lets itself direct attack! This lets you easily create a 3000 ATK beater that can wipe the entire board (and it doesn't destroy, so it gets around pesky destruction-immune things) quite easily.  --  We also have one other Xyz - <strong>Number 64: Ronin Racoon Sandayu</strong> creates powerful tokens that can copy your other big Xyz Monsters' ATK stats, clash into enemy monsters, or be used as material. It's also a Beast, letting you have more options while locked under Obedience - just remember since it's a Number, you can't use it to make Utopic Future.  Next up is their midrange options - Synchro Monsters!  <strong><span>-- The Synchros --</span></strong>  <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> is a very, very good card, and you'll be making it off Kalantosa and Hop-Ear a <em>lot.</em> It locks off any deck that wants to discard or Foolish, and can also tribute itself to negate and destroy, well... essentially any effect! These two abilities make it something that's easy to make and useful in almost any circumstance, albeit one with very frail ATK and DEF. <span>It also searches for Ritual cards when sent to the graveyard, TEMPTING you to give in to the jank and play Ritual Melffy, no matter how idiotic and janky it may be... (Note: Do not do this.) <span>Overall, it's really good, and you can run anywhere between 1 and 3 of it, depending on how much Extra Deck space you're willing to allot.</span></span>  <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> is a bit of a weird one. It's a decent body against lower ATK decks, and when it's destroyed by an enemy card, it becomes a Fiendish against an enemy monster that also lets you steal that monster if it's destroyed. It's mostly a way to deal with decks that Herald can't touch - they can't walk over it as easily, and have to deal with consequences if they do. You can cut it if you want, but I've found some nice success with it.  --  <strong>Naturia Beast,</strong> however, <strong>is not a Hop-Ear summon but a Rescue Cat play!</strong> It needs an EARTH Tuner, meaning your Valerifawn, but at the cost of milling two cards can <strong>negate and destroy... <em>ANY</em> Spell Card.</strong> Yes. <em>Any</em> of them. Any amount of times per turn. This is useful against countless decks - locking off Field Spells, stopping Extravagance draws, countering combos.... You can make it easily by playing Rescue Cat and searching for Valerifawn and either Mine Mole (which lets you draw) or Peropero Cerperus (for later destruction).  You've also got <strong>Naturia Barkion</strong>, its Trap-killing equivalent, hidden in the Side Deck (along with a lv 3 tuner to make it doable with only two material off Cat). The reason it's not in the main Extra Deck is because, unlike what Big Eldlich might attempt to convince you of, most decks don't run many Traps! Plus, it banishes from grave instead of milling as cost, meaning it's more difficult to sustain. Still, spec it in whenever you need it.  Now, onto the last part of the extra deck - the Links!  <strong><span>-- The Links --</span></strong>  The main reason why Links work well with Melffy is because of <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. As Melffy summon themselves during your End Phase and mainly activate during your foe's turn, you can find that while you have a ton of advantage, you can't find a way to actually use it for anything... <strong>Masquerena solves that problem, letting you Link Summon in the midst of your opponent's plays to disrupt them!</strong>  Extra Deck room is tight, so we only really run three Links to capitalize off this, but they're still very good! <ul>  	<li><strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> spins whatever it wants back to deck, helping grab those things out of reach by Kalantosa.</li>  	<li><strong>Topologic Zeroboros</strong> bombs the field the moment something plays next to where a Link points - by using a Melffy Puppy or Melffy Tag to summon something to its linked zones, you can banish the opponent's field on either player's turn, while still letting Zeroboros serve as a beater!</li>  	<li>Finally, <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is indestructible by battle or effects when made via I:P, and can easily wipe out enemies by itself.</li> </ul> Additionally, we have<strong> Missus Radiant</strong>, who is... I'll level with you, it's not great. It only gives your monsters an ATK boost, and recycles an EARTH monster from grave after it leaves the field. However, it's the only Link you can make under Obedience locks, so it's useful nonetheless.  --  That's it. You've now seen practically all this Melffy deck has to offer - recursion, advantage, field wipes, and more on-opponent's-turn effects than you can shake a stick at.  And yet, we're not done! Melffy have so many different options, deckbuild types, and side deck choices to keep in mind that there's probably no limit on varieties of this deck that can be made! Let's close out this guide by taking a close look at them!  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and Variations -- A Guide to Options and Side-Decking --</span></strong>  First of all, we should cover this deck's primary three weaknesses.  <strong>Melffy has a problem with high ATK monsters. </strong>Anything above 3000 ATK that's resistant to destruction will need some smart plays to overcome - perhaps nuking the board with Zeroboros, or stealing that monster to take game early with Utopic Future.  <strong>Melffy also has a problem with boards that pump out a mass of negates.</strong> Reusable negates, in particular, hurts the deck bad - since their plays are spread out across both their own turn and their foe's turn, OPT negation effects become far stronger than they normally would be.  <strong>Finally, Melffy has a problem with things that stop them from gaining field presence.</strong> If your normal summoned Rescue Cat is negated, and you don't have an Obedience Schooled, you might be limited to just playing Puppy/Cathy from hand on end phase and passing, and that's often not enough.  In order to subvert these problems, adding in hand traps, tech cards, and utilising Side Deck space can be crucial. Dark Ruler No More in the Side Deck helps you go second, as does Evenly Matched and Nibiru. 3 Called by the Grave in the main deck cuts down renegade Ash Blossoms (of which you have some of your own, for if you're going second and can't make your disruption), and two Three Tactical Talents lets you further capitalize if you're up against a deck playing a lot of negates.  I also am currently running Effect Veiler for more disruption on the foe's turn, but that's a matter of choice, as is most of these - the world of Yu-Gi-Oh is vast, and there's many other tech choices to subvert the weaknesses of the Melffy!  Now, let's take a look at some other Side Deck cards, Melffy variants, and other choices that may not have made it into this decklist. <ul>  	<li><strong>Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree</strong> is a Level 10 Synchro with <em>juuuust </em>over 3000 ATK and targeting immunity as long as it's not your MP2. You can make it easily with Danger! Bigfoot! and Hop-Ear (or Valerifawn) and it's annoying to get rid of, so you can run it if you want.</li>  	<li><strong>A larger Danger! package</strong> can also be considered, including Danger! Jackalope! as another Beast-type searchable off Cathy, but I tested it and found it not really worth it - 3 Bigfoot covers yourself nicely enough.</li>  	<li><strong>The Fabled Cerburrel </strong>is a Level 2 Tuner that summons itself when discarded! If you're running more copies of Twin Twister or the aforementioned Danger package, you can use it as a way to get free material if you find yourself discarding reliably. Keep in mind that since it's LIGHT, you can't summon Naturia Beast with it. <span>If you really want to be spicy, you can proceed to run <strong>The Fabled Unicore</strong>, which negates all enemy cards and destroys them while each player has even amounts of cards in hand, and use discard effects and Melffy self-bouncing to try and match hands. It's not good, but it IS funny.</span></li>  	<li><strong>Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</strong> is a 2250ATK mechlad that can be dropped from the hand if either player summons a monster from the Main Deck (HINT: PUPPY). You can then summon a monster from your Deck with DEF equal to an enemy monster's ATK and with a matching attribute - this sounds absurdly specific, and it <em>is</em>, but there's a lot of format-specific jank you can pull with it, so keep it in mind!</li>  	<li><strong>Closed Forest</strong> stops your opponent from using Field Spells as long as it's around (and for a turn if it's popped). It's a silver bullet, and you can cut it for more Side Deck room, but it IS hilarious when it works.</li>  	<li><strong>Tribrigade Melffy</strong> is a deck hybrid that can work pretty okay. It does run into problems with Obedience Schooled, so cut that down if you want to use it, but it's still good... though you should probably run a different Tribrigade variant, at that point.  Out of the two pure beast Tribrigades, <strong>Tribrigade Ceras</strong> can summon itself by discarding (something something Cerburrel synergy?!), and can use your graved Beasts and Beast-alikes to Link Summon, which is cool, but means you can't use that graveyard stuff for Melffy Tag or HAS or the like. <strong>Tribrigade </strong><strong>Felidgette, the Fruitless Flower</strong> is an interesting Missus Radiant alternative, offering summoning from hand and a janky hand-cycling effect in place of Missus's attack boosting and grave recycling. Either of these can be run as tech choices in a ""pure Melffy"" deck like this one if you want!</li>  	<li>You can run a <strong>Melffy Ojama</strong> build if you want, but I find that typically Ojama have better things to hybrid with and better ways to mass-search themselves in archetype with tools like Ojamatch and Ojamagic, and Melffy have better things they could be searching than mostly-Normal monsters.</li>  	<li>Of the other things you can search with Melffy Cathy, there's two main notable ones - <strong>Red Hared Hasty Horse</strong> is a decent body that's easy to summon, easy material, and can help you steal lethal even earlier alongside Excited Melffy. More notably, however, <strong>King Tiger</strong> <strong>Wanghu </strong>is a <em>hilarious</em> stun piece, outright declaring ""no, you lose"" to decks that run mostly monsters under 1400 ATK in the Main Deck and have no ways to out it.</li>  	<li><strong>Super Rush Recklessly</strong> was a stun choice I ran in previous variants of Melffy. It's a trap that lets you destroy a beast you control to spin an enemy's card back to the Deck... but since it needs that destruction to happen in order for the spin to trigger, it whiffs if you have a HAS on the board, and since it's a trap, it's slow and vulnerable to destruction. If you're not running HAS, though, feel free to take it for a... spin.</li>  	<li>Since Negalogia AA-Zeus can attach monsters from your Extra Deck when a card you control is destroyed, you can run a single copy of <strong>Elder Entity N'tss </strong>to allow pops if Negalogia goes down.</li>  	<li>If you really want to run <strong>Melffy Rabby</strong> for the cute factor of it, you can do it alongside <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong>, but I find it's bricky and a little redundant when you already have Rescue Cat.</li> </ul> <strong><span>-- Final Notes --</span></strong>  And... that's it. You should now have a comprehensive idea on how to start up, use, and experiment with a Melffy tempo deck! The Melffy archetype is an adorable font of potential and interesting deck strategies, and I've honestly loved experimenting with it ever since the first cards were shown in Japan - if it gets more new cards in the future, I'll be sure to take a look at them! I hope reading this has convinced you to take a trek through the Forest as well, and see just what interesting choices you can find there!  I'd like to thank <a>QuincyMcCoy</a> from the YGOrganization on the idea to use Amazoness Baby Tiger - he makes fantastic creative deck build ideas, be sure to check them out! Additionally, if you'd like to check out a completely different but still unique and powerful Melffy deck idea, why not go look at <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffy-combo-fibrax-and-the-friends-of-the-forest/"">Renren's Halqifibrax build?</a>  Thank you for reading! If you've come this far and enjoyed this deep dive into the archetype, a like or comment would be thoroughly appreciated! Ciao!"

Nothing but Mayakashi.,"This deck blinds first to set-up your synchros for interaction on the next turn. But, it fares well enough going second as well, but it does lose to like 1 negate against <strong>Hajun</strong> or <strong>Dakki</strong>.  This deck simply needs 1 path to <strong>Dakki</strong> and a level 1 monster on the field. 3 <strong>Hajun</strong>, 3 <strong>Dakki</strong>, 3 <strong>Yuki-Mususme</strong>, 3<strong> Uni-Zombie</strong>, 3 <strong>Shiranui Solitaire</strong>, and 3 <strong>Mezuki</strong> is the normal ratios. You can play <strong>Dakki</strong> at 2, but it is such a big target for interruptions that having more than 1 is advised. Also, you can side out the <strong>Solitaires</strong> for things like <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> or <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> since the <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> path in this deck is lackluster. 3 <strong>Kinka-byo</strong> since you need to see those level 1 monsters those being <strong>Hajun</strong> and<strong> Yuki-Musume</strong>. 1 <strong>Shafu</strong> for recursion and 1 <strong>Pankratops</strong> since its a good card if you are forced to go second.  3 <strong>Mayakahsi Return</strong> since it is <strong>ROTA</strong> and <strong>Foolish</strong>. 3 <strong>Desires</strong> since draw power. 3 <strong>Where Arf Thou?</strong> since you need to have level 1 monsters in your opening. 3 <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> to deal with backrow decks. <strong>One for One</strong> of course for the level 1 monsters. 3 <strong>Mayakashi Metamorphosis</strong> since it gets out a body and recycles your banished zombies. 1<strong> Mayakashi Mayhem</strong> just for some spice. You can probably play <strong>Mayakashi Winter</strong> instead if you want.  Extra Deck has 2 of each <strong>Mayakashi</strong> Synchro since you tend to need to make more as the game progresses. 2 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</strong> since you are locked into <strong>Mayakashi's</strong> with <strong>Hajun</strong> and <strong>Dakki</strong> and <strong>Dakki</strong> only triggers off of the summon of <strong>Mayakashi</strong> Extra Deck Mons. If that weren't the case, I'd play <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> or <strong>Avendread Savior</strong>. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong>. It's a good card, but its own archetype can't make it consistently. 1 <strong>Thousand-Eyes</strong> since its a level 1 that is removal and one that you can synchro with.  Side Deck is 3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 3 <strong>Belle</strong>, <strong>Instant Fusion</strong>, 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, <strong>Imperial Order</strong>, 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, and <strong>Red Reboot</strong>."

It uses all of your monster zones, including the extra monster zone, and ends on discard 1, draw 5, with Savage and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.

When going first with this deck, you can side out <strong>Nibiru</strong> and <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> for <strong>Secret Village</strong> and <strong>Magician of Black Chaos Max</strong>. Despite this deck blinding second, <strong>Super Poly </strong>isn't main decked since your targets are only for specific match-ups.  <strong>Black Chaos Max</strong> makes it so that your opponent can't activate monster effects the turn it is summoned so you can shotgun into it on your opponent's turn with <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>. <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic </strong>however is your main fusion spell to go into your <strong>Dark Magician </strong>Fusions or <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> if you have turn something into a dragon monster with the effect of <strong>Dragoncaller Magician</strong>. But most of the time, you will be getting to <strong>Dragoon</strong> with <strong>The Eye of Timaeus </strong>it gets you one monster destruction per turn, but it's still a <strong>Dragoon</strong> on the field which takes a lot of effort to get off of the field. <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic </strong>can also get you a <strong>Starving Venom </strong><strong>Fusion Dragon</strong> during the battle phase to get the last bit of necessary damage that you need.  <strong>Dark Magic Circle</strong> is your main source of removal in your deck so its at three copies. <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> is a good card but the downside of blowing up your field when its destroyed makes it great at one copy per deck. <strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong> summons your one of <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> (no need to play it at more than 1 copy) and searches a board wipe (<strong>Dark Burning Magic</strong>).  We are playing <strong>Dragoncaller Magician</strong> since it's pend effect make 1 monster you control a dragon monster and its monster effect makes itself a dragon monster so that you can hard make <strong>Dragoon</strong>. Also it has an effect do double the attack of a fusion, synchro, or xyz monster that used it as material when battling a dragon.  <strong>BLS Solder of Chaos</strong> is almost like a pseudo-<strong>Dragoon</strong> since it is pretty hard to get off the field. <strong>Borrelsword</strong> is for more damage. <strong>Daybreaker </strong>instead of <strong>Selene</strong> since we are not playing <strong>Endymion </strong>cards and also <strong>Daybreaker</strong> is a source of removal.<strong> Ebon High Magician</strong> floats into a spellcaster and it allows you to activate traps and quick play spells from your hand on your opponent's turn. <strong>Dracossack </strong>is a generic rank 7. <strong>Harmonizer Gradielle</strong> is a very unique card and aside from being a generic rank 7, it can be good against certain strategies.  We are not playing <strong>Apprentice Illusion Magician</strong> since this decks strategy is more reliant on the Extra Deck than overall field control with <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> and <strong>Dark Magic Circle</strong>. You could also play <strong>Chaos Space</strong> to search <strong>Magician of Black Chaos Max</strong> considering if you also play something like <strong>Psy-framegear Gamma </strong>or <strong>Palladium Oracle </strong><strong>Mahad.</strong>"

There are a lot of different cards splashed in, except for the combo enablers, because every Main Deck Monster effect is a HOPT.  <strong>There is no specific combo, except for the last</strong> <strong>steps.</strong><strong> </strong>I'll mention important parts below.  <strong>This Deck includes OCG and TCG exclusive cards: </strong>Decode Talker Heatsoul (OCG), Code Exporter (OCG) and Scrypton (TCG). I would cut out Scrypton but need to replace it with something, so that the Deck still works.  &nbsp;  <em>Q&amp;A:</em>  <strong>What is the main play?</strong>  Link climbing. Most of the Deck consists of monsters that special summon themselves or act as extenders. You will need enough Link monsters in your GY, so that the <strong>combined Linkrating equals 28</strong>.  <strong>Why consists the Deck of 48 cards.</strong>  After trying to optimize it I noticed that a 40 card Deck could never be enough to mill for Cyberse Clock Dragon. You have to mill 30 cards from your Deck, <strong>after</strong> Link climbing like crazy and searching through your Deck countless times. 48 cards gives the best consistency (seeing your important Combo cards in the Starting Hand), while having enough to mill at the end. It depends sometimes, how you combo of, keep track of your Deck Size, because Cyberse Clock Dragon <strong>can't mill more</strong> then you have in your Deck.  <strong>Which cards are important?</strong>  The only important card is <strong>Cynet Codec. </strong>It is searchable with <strong>Micro Coder</strong>. Lady Debug and One for One can search Micro Coder so you are basically playing 10 copies of Cynet Codec.  <strong>Garnets?</strong>  <strong>Starliege Seyfert </strong>(if you don't have already Levianeer in the hand) and <strong>Catapult Turtle. </strong>Depending on the Starting Hand you can get rid of 1 Garnet with Cynet Mining (also searchable with Micro Coder: <span>search it only if you already have a Cynet Codec in hand</span>)but opening both Garnets is a Combokiller.  <strong>How does the FTK work?</strong>  Cynet Codec is your endless extender. Link climb until the combined Link rating of your Link monster on the Field and in the GY equal 28, keep track of your Deck Size that must also be in the best case scenario 30 at the end of Link climbing.  <span>Important: <span>While almost any Effect locks you into special summoning Cyberse from the Extra Deck, Transcode Talker's effect locks you entirely into Cyberse. <strong>Do not activate Transcode Talker's effect to special summon from GY. </strong>Otherwise you can't summon Levianeer and Catapult Turtle for the finishing blow.</span></span>  You will need 1 copy of <strong>Clock Wyvern</strong> in your hand: searchable with Cynet Codec, when summoning <strong>Excode Talker.</strong>  You will need <strong>Cynet Fusion</strong> in your hand: searchable with <strong>Clock Spartoi.</strong>  You will need <strong>at least 2 monster including at least 1 Link </strong>on your field after finishing the Link grind. <ol>  	<li>Activate Cynet Fusion and Fusion with Cyberse Clock Dragon with Clock Wyvern and 1 Link monster on the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Do not </strong>activate Cyberse Clock Wyverns effect yet.</li>  	<li>Link into <strong>Clock Lizard.</strong></li>  	<li>Activate Clock Lizard's effect.</li>  	<li>Bounce Cyberse Clock Dragon back into the Extra Deck and choose your Fusion materials from your GY. <span>Now you have to count the combined Link rating of the Fusion materials, those must equal your remaining cards in your Deck and has to be at least 30. You climbed for 28 because Clock Lizard is a must play and also a Link 2.</span></li>  	<li>Summon Cyberse Clock Dragon again <strong>and activate his effect.</strong> Mill 30 cards from your Deck (best case, because we need Catapult Turtle, Starliege Seyfert and Chaos Dragon Levianeer in the GY. It could happen that if you have 31 cards left in your Deck and mill only 30, that on of those 3 is missing. <span>Better mill everything, then bricking</span>)<span>.</span></li>  	<li>Cyberse Clock Dragons ATK increases for 30k points, all in all 32,5k.</li>  	<li>Activate Starliege Seyferts GY activate and add Levianeer from GY to hand.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Levianeer from your hand by banishing <strong>only LIGHT monsters</strong> from your GY.</li>  	<li>Activate Levianeers effect and special summon Catapult Turtle from GY.</li>  	<li>Use Catapult Turtle's effect and tribute Cyberse Clock Dragon.</li> </ol> Here is a replay of me FTKing a Tag with 16k Life.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUw76yEkp8U&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>"

The deck runs numerous warrior monsters: three copies of Blue Flame Swordsman, which give a very good performance when played with ""Marauding Captain"" and ""Valkyrian Knight"" (that even though not part of Joey's cards I added to the deck because of its good interactions with the above said cards).  Then the classic Jinzo, Gearfried and its evolution and, to conclude, some support for Red-Eyes used by Joey in the anime: ""Paladin of Dark Dragon"" and the very good ""Lord of the Red"". Manju of 10.000 hands to ease their summon. ""Fusion Reserve"" to recover Polymerization and work faster on your fusions."

That's what cards like ""Coffin Seller"", ""Nightmare Wheel"", ""Bowganian"", ""Lava Golem"" are for. Adding to these the classic cards Marik uses to stall the opponent, like ""Holding Arms"", Vengeful Bog Spirit"", ""Mirror Force"" and ""Metal Reflect Slime"", makes of his deck a force to be rockoned with. Also, the recent support around this last card: ""Reactor Slime"" and ""Egyptian God Slime"" make possible a whole new play around ""MRS"". (EGS run at 3 because Reactor Slime allows for recovery of MRS which is alone required to summon its fusion"".  The strong calibers are here represented by ""Helpoemer"", ""Legendary Fiend"" and ""Masked Beast Des Gardius"".  However the strong point of Marik's deck is represented by its egyptian god: ""The Winged Dragon of Ra"". Almost useless some time ago, now it has been relaunched greatly in the game by the new support that makes use of the very strong effects Ra had in the anime: ""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"" and ""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Immortal Phoenix"", but also the spell cards ""Ancient Chant"", ""Blaze Cannon"" and ""Millenium Revelation"", that allow for good search power and recovery of Ra from the grave. ""Monster Reincarnation"" to boost even more the recovery of your god card from the grave and of those monsters like ""Juragedo"", which is much better to have back in hand rather than special summoned.  Also the classico common cards of the Duel Monsters era remain: ""Pot of Greed"", ""Graceful Charity"" and ""Monster Reborn"", a key card in this deck."

This lets you 1.) Get a free Ghostrick name on the field, 2.) Search a Ghostrick Spell/Trap for free, and 3.) Leave an open normal summon for a Ghostrick Monster to lock your opponent. Optimally the deck searches <a data-name=""Ghostrick Scare"">Ghostrick Scare</a> and sets <a data-name=""Ghostrick Nekomusume"">Ghostrick Nekomusume</a>, This is a recur-able Book of Moon that turns into a flood-gate that flips all level 4 or higher monsters face down.  With the regular rank 3 toolbox cards like <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>, and<a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow""> Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> can help provide additional negates/ card destructions to help solve matchups. The deck also plays a small Burning abyss engine, because with any 2 level 3 monsters you can get access to <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>, he lets you send <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the burning Abyss</a> to special any of the Burning abyss monsters in your deck letting you extend your plays this turn and gain recursion for the next.  <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a> is my favorite tech in deck letting you get additional value off of any trap card. It might seem weird at first to tech Multifaker with so few trap cards in the main deck but that is such a small problem due to how searchable the Ghostrick spell/trap line up is. A small thing to note is that while <a data-name=""Ghostrick Scare"">Ghostrick Scare</a> can’t always be activated <a data-name=""Ghostrick Night"">Ghostrick Night</a> can always be activated, so sometimes it’s worth it to search night instead if Multifaker is in your hand and you can’t get a face down Ghostrick monster on the board.  I’ll also mention here that<a data-name=""Marauding Captain""> Marauding Captain</a> is a very good card in this deck that lets you special summon a Ghostrick monster ignoring its' must be set condition, while also being a level 3 monster.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</span></strong>  Outside of raw power and dependence on going first the deck is relatively decent. It’s surprisingly consistent, Book of moon Effects are very powerful in the current game, and the deck even has decent recursion. Looking at the current state of Yugioh sometimes it’s just not enough to have a few floodgates and disruptions.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>What to do Going Second?</span></strong>  &nbsp;  Side out the Ghostrick main deck cards, Side in handtraps. Spam monsters to get to links like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and try to OTK."

Orcust is still super strong and with these 3 engines combined you can not brick, go first or second and win! In testing the deck did extremely well and this is 100% competitive just like my other decks I post for you guys. Going first you can do full Orcust combo and / or end on Mechaba, using Aleister to make Almiraj, then set <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> under Almiraj and special summon any Mekk-Knight then with Almiraj and that Mekk-Knight you go into <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star"">Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</a> <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star"">and search Succession and special summon back the Mekk-Knight. From this point you can use the two Mekk-Knights to go into </a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme"">Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme</a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star"">, which is a cool tech I like because he is hard to get over. Also, ending on Mechaba after that. Although if you have an extra monster you can use it and the Mekk-Knight special summoned from Succession in the previous step to go into IP. Then use Invocation to banish Aleister plus the Mekk-Knight to fusion summon Mechaba. You can also do full Orcust combo, it just depends on your hand. During your opponent's turn you can use IP's effect to use itself and Mekk-Knight Morning Star to go into the Mekk-Knight Crusadia Link 4. It will be almost impossible for your opponent to get over considering you also have a Mechaba / Orcust stuff on board. Going second you just special summon the Mekk-Knights and OTK using cards like </a><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star""> and Purgatrio etc... The cool thing I like about this deck is Blue Sky can search Girsu, which is normal summon for full Orcust combo. Pretty crazy huh?! If your opponent somehow stops you from playing going second, sometimes you will be able to use the Orcust engine to continue playing and OTK through. Hope you guys enjoy!</a>"

You have to hit level 1 extenders on your way through the combo, but the card draw really helps, and you set up Roland into Charlemange very easily. The advantages to this engine (over Romulus Dragons) are access to Calamities is that your Gearfried is significantly more powerful and reliable, and you can search without stretching yourself too far in deck building. The disadvantage is lack of good access to great 1 card starters - the deck relies so heavily on Fire Warriors that trying to run Neo-Space Connector or Amra Knight engines seems iffy. It also generally ends on smaller board states, though you could argue making Calamities a lot of the time is better than a board full of negates (I'm not 100% sure this is the case, but it's true often enough).  Added Smoke Grenade of the Thief and replaced the Fire engine with the Aqua Dolphin engine, giving us 5 ways to rip cards out of our opponent's hand. This slightly reduces the level 1 count of the deck, but the deck is a very flexible combo deck, so making Calamities slightly less often isn't such a big deal (especially with Gearfried as an easy level 9)."

The Deck has some versatility as you can use different Elemental Heroes for different purposes.  One of the few boss monsters can make sure your opponent isn't able to use any floating effects like Sangan as it will be banished instead of being sent to the GY thanks to the effect of Elemental Hero Dark Law, on top of that whenever your opponent draws or searches their deck for a card(s) they will randomly have to banish one card from their hand.  Elemental Hero Anki can make sure you can keep attacking more than once, when it destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the GY, however be aware that this will not work when Elemental Hero Dark Law is out as it will also circumvent the effects of monsters you control that rely on destroying and sending other monsters to the GY.  Elemental Hero Acid can make short work of your opponent's backrow, while Elemental Hero Blast can cut a monster's ATK in half and is also able to send a spell/trap card back to your opponent's hand at the cost of 500 LP, once in either player's turn.  &nbsp;  I'd just suggest trying the deck out and seeing for yourself.  &nbsp;  If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment below!  &nbsp;  Thank you and have a nice day!"

This can easily be achieved with its many searches such as Wicckid and Alembertian, which is gotten to via Link Disciple and Link Devotee. But in the scenario where you have to first you can change your Final sigma into a I:P, a set Superfactorial with Diameter in GY for an extra negate and any hand trap you have drawn. The deck can play through quite a few disruptions and in the grind game, it gets really hard for your opponent to out Final Sigma. All in all its a fun OTK deck that core is relatively cheap if you buy 1 Alembertian. I hope you enjoyed, bye."

Step 1 is to get Nopenguin either on the field or in the Graveyard. He will be very important for later.  Then, if you draw an Aquarium Stage, you should totally activate it. Then set either Penguin Soldier or Nightmare Penguin face down. Their effects send cards from your opponent's field back to the hand. Except they don't, because the effect of Nopenguin will Special Summon itself from the GY, and then any effect that would cause a monster to return to the hand will banish it instead. Then, thanks to Aquarium Stage, your WATER attribute monsters won't be destroyed by battle.  If you're worried about some useless face-up penguins crowding up your field, don't worry. Book of Moon, Book of Eclipse or Ghostrick Doll can make sure they go back face down so you can use their effects again.  Once you've crippled your opponent's deck, you'll need to attack. That's why this deck had options. Tributing one monster will allow you to summon Great Emperor Penguin, which will allow you to Special Summon two other penguins. There are also plenty of Rank 3 and 4 Xyz monsters in the Extra Deck to use, though these can be swapped out with any you prefer. We just need something to attack with once we've banished all your opponent's important cards.  Royal Decree is also in this Deck, because most of the cards that would stop this strategy are Trap Cards, and we don't really need Trap Cards in this Deck anyway."

We are using <strong>Forbidden Droplets</strong> to negate your opponent's monsters' effect and to halve their ATK to start building up the OTK. We have <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> if we don't open <strong>Forbidden Droplets</strong> or if we have backrow to destroy. <strong>Red Reboot</strong> for traps. <strong>Nibiru, Ash Blossom</strong>, and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> to disrupt your opponent. This deck doesn't need that much engine cards just like <strong>Salamangreat</strong> so you can play a lot more handtraps and disruptions for going second.  Your main starter is <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> since it gets you to <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon</strong> which gets you <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> which gets you <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> (an abomination of a localization if you ask me). That is then the full OTK. <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> gives your <strong>Gaia</strong> fusion 2600 more ATK and another attack. <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> then gains 2600 more ATK when it destroys a monster by battle. You can also have it lose 2600 ATK to target 1 card and destroy it. <strong>Artillery Catapult Turtle</strong> gets to to <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> or <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon</strong> from your deck.  Field spells include <strong>Gateway to Chaos</strong> and <strong>Charging Gaia</strong> to search <strong>Gaia</strong> cards and <strong>Charging Gaia</strong> also gives you battle phase protection. <strong>Set Rotation</strong> because there is no reason not top play it in this situation.  <strong>Spiral Spear Strike</strong> is for piercing and a sort of ""win-more draw power.""  <strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion</strong> to search <strong>Spiral Spear Strike</strong>. <strong>Idaten</strong> and <strong>Shura</strong> because why not. <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> to destroy spells and traps. <strong>Proxy F Magician</strong> to get to some Fusion Plays. <strong>Soldier of Chaos</strong> because it good.

It has various Rank 8 options that can stop your opponent from making plays or set your own plays up for the next turn. Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord and Lancelot can prevent an effect from activating, while Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon can set up your graveyard for the next turn. You should try to recycle resources using Starliege Seyfert, Slash Draw, and Chaos Emperor, The Dragon of Armageddon. There are multiple styles that this deck can be played in, and you should adapt depending on the opponent you are facing."

So I tried the basic build with 3x Cyber Dragon and 3x Machine duplications but I felt I briked alot because I had either 2 machine dupes in every turn in hand or 2 cyber Dragons included one machine dupe so there where like 3 cards always that hold me up from playing the game consistent.  For my new strategy I was thinking about how many handtraps the current top tier contestors play and how can I build a viable CyDra-Deck that can compete with them?  Let us look over the Deck:  Monsters:  1x Cyber Dragon = your target for  herz or Nachster  3x Core = Basic Game-Starter who searches you any spell or trap, usually searches plant or emergency for your herz/soldie  3x Herz = Target to get on the grave and has synergie with Galaxy Soldier  2x Nachster= You want him in the grind game or after you get nibirud in the with summon what is rare because you have Infinity always on your 5th  1x Vier = target for cyberload fusion or just chainblocking core !carefull he can destroy your plans to 5th summon Infinity and get Nibirued  3x Soldier = basic play into infinity and our rank 5  2x Jizikiru = clean out the opponents board from their boss monsters and you can use him for fotrtress dragon  1x Pankratops = great going second card with removal  3x Ash = holds enemy from detaching or just searching from deck  3x Veiler = usefull against Needlefiber and to stop your opponents monster from their effects + target f or galaxy soldier effect  3x Gamma = nice handtrap stops Opponent from play and can quick end their turn  1x Frame = target for gamma  Spells:  3x Emergency = basic searcher  1x Revsystem = reborn for your cydras or ss from hand  1x Plant = searches your galaxy soldier from deck or herz if needed in hand  1x cyberload = target anaconda or give tickle out last dmg for the otk  1x overload = basic target anaconda for your rampage  1x one for one = combo starter and extender  1x foolish = extender and bait for ash  Traps:  1x Overflow = good removal  2x evenly = I don´t got 3 otherwise I would run 3 of them great if you can´t otk that turn or need to clean board  1x red reboot = for the otk and anti trap from your opponent  3x Imperm = negates one effect and is pretty necessary  Extra:  Almiraj = Basic target to get core in grave for plant  Relinq = generic link 1 perfect target for herz and nachster can also soak the kaiju you place to your opponents side  Anaconda = Basic OTK enabler  Sieger = another otk enabler and also protecting your cydras with 2.1k boost  2x Nova = basic rank 5 target, second effect is nice if get nibirued to early  2x infinity = why not, more infinity more negates  2x Rampage = basic fusion target to otk and remove 2 or more  1x Drill Driver = new monster want to test it but seems nice with getting one level 5 back  1x Twin = Can OTK with Cyberload Fusion  2x Megafleet = removal from linkmonster  1x Fortress = removal all machine monsters amazing against orcust and also good if the enemy controlls a kaiju from you  Side:  I put the Dragoon engine in it because we want him as soon as he is released.. more negates more consistency with Anaconda. I would switch Effect Veiler for this Engine and in my Extra Deck maybe the Drill Driver  &nbsp;"

Today I created a Heroic Challenger Deck. This Deck revolves around using multiple Heroic monsters to bring out their Xyz monsters. Their best card, <a data-name=""Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades"">Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades, can bring out any of the Heroic monsters from the Deck, but for it's cost, you are restricted to Summoning only Heroic Xyz monsters for the rest of the turn, which is kind of a bummer, but understandable. But despite this, they were overall not as bad as a Deck I thought it would be. Below are some tips and things you should know about the Deck.</a>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>This Deck can be at it's best when going second. Going first isn't terrible for the Deck, but they do not have as many options. The best move you should perform if this happens is to go into <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Heroic Champion - Gandiva"">Heroic Champion - Gandiva</a>, <a data-name=""Heroic Champion - Excalibur"">Heroic Champion - Excalibur</a>, or even Kusanagi if you want.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Starters: Photon Thrasher, Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd, Goblindbergh, and Neo Space Connector. Lightning Storm for going second if opponent has a troublesome board.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The Side Deck has the rest of the archetype along with other cards that work well with the Deck. Do whatever you please with it.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>For those who don't know how Isolde Combo works with Deck: Normal Summon Connector, then use it's effect to Special Summon Aqua Dolphin (Dolphin's effect isn't mandatory). Use them both to Link Summon Isolde, then use effect to add any HEROIC (since we will be bringing out Thousand Blades). Use Isolde's effect to send 4 Equips to GY, then Special Summon Thousand Blades.

Cant get more meta then this deck, but it","<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Very consistent build of the new Dogmatika archetype in combination with the invoked boy. Dogmatika is currently a decent archetype but needs support from other cards/engines to make it competitive. Iblee and sangan are in this list for consistency and to create a 'softlock' with winda. Both cards also set up the dogmatika combo the same as aleister does. Additionally if meltdown/terraforming gets ashed you still have a decent NS with those cards. Iblee and sangan are no bricks, bc. you can send them with shaddoll apkallone, forbidden droplets or mechaba even if you have aleister as your NS. They basically add consistency and multiple options in matchups to the deck. &lt;3  <strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>The ratios of the cards are not final! Needs more testing to 'perfect' the build -&gt; Comment if you know better ratios of the cards used :)  ------------------------------------------------------------  <strong>Tbh. you dont need to run the invoked engine in this deck!</strong> Its just very compact so you can maindeck a bunch of handtraps to play against the other meta b***s**t.  In addition i decided to run iblee and sangan. Both cards do basically the same as aleister, just differently. 4Head  <strong>Sangan is worse than aleister</strong> as a starter but searches a handtrap/ecclesia for the next turn.  <strong>Iblee is arguably better/worse than aleister.</strong> But iblee sets up a 'softlock' with iblee on opponents board and only 1 SS with winda (+ shaddoll schism disruption). In addition iblee prevents handtraps like nibiru, impermanence, phantazmei, gamma, and more... By itself iblee absolutely destroys meta decks like eldlich, bc. they usually dont play an extradeck link card (in high level competitive play) to out it. -&gt; Free win going first!  -&gt; <strong>Both cards do not interfere with aleister as the better NS.</strong> You can still send sangan/iblee from the hand to resolve the shaddoll apkallone, forbidden droplets or mechaba.  &nbsp;  <strong>Other cards than the invoked engine could be (no complete list):</strong> <ul>  	<li>3x sangan + 2x tour guide to search even more handtraps or Ecclesia in the EP</li>  	<li>3x mekk-knight orcust girsu with a very small orcust engine -&gt; but plays get very complicated, bc. orcust locks into darks; but it is possible to do combos: e.g. galatea + crescendo or just dingirsu for protection</li>  	<li>3x iblee + cynet mining -&gt; again iblee is super underrated as a 1 card NS that stops handtraps</li>  	<li>3x formud skipper with parallel exceed -&gt; but needs min. 2 extra deck spaces</li>  	<li>3x trickstar candina + corobane + light stage</li>  	<li>gizmek, cyber dragon, time thief, true draco,...</li>  	<li>.... pretty much any 1-card engine that does something usefull and has a dark/light attribute</li> </ul> <strong>PS:</strong> Sidedeck is garbage -&gt; basically just cards good against eldlich, bc. i hate this deck with a burning passion  Thanks for reading and you are beautiful &lt;3  xqcL"

From this we can use these cards to make link summons from almeraj to crystron Halqifibrax to search Deskbot 001. From this you can make Auroradon to trigger deskbot 001 in grav to bring it back onto the  field from grav to essentially make VFD. After we made this combo, using cards in hand and draw advantage from comboing into VFD we can use the effects of Dogmatika. This makes it more consistent for Dogmatika to trigger their effects onto the field.  Combo Tutorial:  https://youtu.be/Osh_59q2oFU"

Also jfc there are so many Dark monsters rn, boy can smack through an eldlich or a savage dragon.  Girl: If you don't run at least a copy, the dark magicians cant float at all, also sending her off of souls isn't unreasonable if you don't have an eternal soul at the ready for DM, you can bring her back with it too, buuut if you weren't using it to make verte you'd be summoning DM lets be real. Could be a REBD if you want the second pop  Keeper: If you're holding DM, it's a one card dragoon! if not, it searches REF for next turn (if they negate the effect activation so you're not locked into fusions, you can use it and either souls or apprentice to make verte, which remains a instant dragoon)  Blue Boy: haha draw engine go brrrrrr  Eye of Timaeus: So the downsides, it has to target a DM, and you cant search it at all, but you don't need a second material, it makes all your fusions, and all it requires is an on board DM, it's probably not actually good enough, but god if it doesn't feel great singing its name to the eye of the tiger while slapping down a dragoon.  Secrets of Dark Magic: Quick play poly, searchable, use it after you spend all your attacks to get in for lethal.  &nbsp;  Big eye: Steal their shit and hit em with it, probably could be some link 3 instead  Selene: Super easy to make, then jumps right into Accesscode, giving it 3k boost"

My first version of this combination.,"This deck can go for crazy combos. If you mill enough Mezukis you can build almost every board. The strenghts  of this deck is, that it has many possibilities going first. You can summon things like Apollousa, Doomking, Avramax, Archlord Kristia or Rank 8 XYZ. The weakness is the lack of constance. If your mills are bad or your hand is to bricky this deck will suck. But summoning the new Chaos Ruler will help alot. After he arrives the combos can go on."

Just spam Xyz monsters onto the field.  This deck heavily relies on its normal summon. If you don't have an extender after your normal summon is <strong>Ash Blossomed</strong> or negated somehow, your turn is basically over unless you have an extender in your and even with that, your turn won't be as great as it would've been. Your starters include <strong>Beautunaful Princess</strong>, <strong>Buzzsaw Shark</strong>, <strong>Lantern Shark</strong>, and <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong>.<strong> Beautunaful</strong> gets you to<strong> Buzzsaw</strong> or<strong> Lantern Shark</strong> from deck. <strong>Lantern Shark</strong> and <strong>Buzzsaw Shark</strong> get you to rank 3's, 4's, and 5's. <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong> isn't the best starter, but it does do the job well especially if you have the right extenders.  Your extenders include <strong>Beautunaful Princess</strong> (off of <strong>One for One</strong>), <strong>Left-Hand</strong>/<strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>, <strong>White Stingray</strong>, and <strong>Xyz Remora</strong>. <strong>Tuna</strong> summons <strong>Buzzsaw</strong> or <strong>Lantern Shark</strong> from deck (the one whose effect you haven't used yet). <strong>Left</strong> and<strong> Right Hand</strong> are like midgame extenders; you really don't want to open with them. <strong>White Stingray</strong> is a very nice extender and recycler. <strong>Xyz Remora</strong> is best used to remove the materials from an Xyz monster and since you do, you special summon the 2 materials from grave an now you have 1 more xyz monster. The Xyz monster with no material can be used for<strong> Full Armored Crystalzero Lancer</strong> if it was a rank 5.  <strong>Lifeless Leaffish</strong> is just a fish target for your special summons. It can send your<strong> Left-Hand Shark</strong> from deck to grave to have an extender if you also control <strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>. It can also recycle 3 fishes for you to draw 1 card.  <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> send <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong> or <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>. <strong>Revive Slash</strong> banishes from grave to rank up a water xyz monster you control.<strong> Kairyu-Shin</strong> protects against board wipes. <strong>One for One</strong> is for<strong> Beautunaful Princess</strong>.<strong> RUM</strong> is for <strong>Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</strong> or <strong>Number c103: Ragnafinity</strong>. <strong>TTT</strong> since <strong>Called By</strong> is Limited (this deck rather play <strong>Called By</strong> but its more of a brick at this point). <strong>White Mirror</strong> for an extender and searcher. <strong>Whitefish Salvage</strong> recycles fish and floats into a fish when destroyed. <strong>TT</strong> since we are playing <strong>Kairyu-Shin. </strong>  Extra Deck: <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> is of course great for its effect and it is water support. <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> summons <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong> (which is at 2 now). <strong>D/D/D Wave High King Caesar</strong> is a non opt <strong>Solemn Warning</strong> that you can rank up into with <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong>. <strong>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</strong> since it is for <strong>RUM</strong> and it's removal.<strong> Number 103: Ragnazero</strong> since it's a <strong>RUM</strong> target and more removal. <strong>Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark</strong> since it floats into a monster (also Manga ZEXAL is waaaay better than the anime).<strong> Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</strong> and <strong>Number C101: Ragnafinity</strong> for your<strong> RUM</strong> targets. 2 <strong>Toads</strong> for<strong> Bahamut Shark</strong>. 2 <strong>Valiant Shark Lancers</strong> as <strong>Dridents</strong> and a <strong>RUM</strong> stacker. Also <strong>Mistarboy</strong> since water deck.  Side Deck has the staple himself,<strong> Nibiru</strong>, along with your third copy of <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong> and <strong>Xyz Revive Splash</strong>. <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> for going second removal. Your second and third <strong>TT</strong> for <strong>Kairyu-Shin</strong>. 2 <strong>White Howling</strong> for spell decks. Finally, 3<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong> as disruption."

Get as many monsters on board as possible. Use Jizukiru to get rid of your opponent’s best monster. If you have other Jizukiru’s in your hand, special summon them.  2. Link summon into Borrelsword Dragon  3. Activate Overload Fusion to banish the Cyber Dragon monsters from grave to summon Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Use both of his effects.  4. Attack with both Borrelsword and Rampage. Typically, this is enough to win.  5. If Borrelsword and Rampage don’t get the job done, activate Cyberload Fusion during the battle phase to special summon Cyber End Dragon or Cyber Eternity Dragon and swing for game.  I play 3 Machine Duplication and 2 Cyberload Fusions because they form a nice loop of recycling Cyber Dragons and prevent Machine Duplication from being completely dead as a late game top deck. The chances of bricking are worth it, and I can search Cyberload with Core."

""Fur Hires"" are a rather spammy beatdown-focussed archetype. Their overall goal is to fill the board with a number of monsters and use their trigger effects, which activate upon entry of other ""Fur Hires"" in case of every monster from Level 1 to 4, or trigger effects that check how many different ""Fur Hires"" you actually got on the board in case of monsters from Level 5 to 8. In addition to that, the smaller ""Fur Hires"" are all able to summon a differently named ""Fur Hire"" monster from the hand, while the bigger ones either bring some sort of protection for the crew members or negation effects. The huge number of monsters that is amassed by playing this archetype correctly can then be used for Extra Deck summons to strengthen your board presence or simply be rammed into your opponent's face for an OTK. When I was building the deck, I focussed on their spamming capabilities over making them more control-oriented. The key card is definitely ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" and he should be the first Extra Deck card you want to summon if no other, more immediate problems are staring you in the face from the opposing side of the field.</p> <p>Aside from chain summoning ""Fur Hire"" monsters, you can use the ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>""/""<a data-name=""Reproducus"">Reproducus</a>"" combo to Special summon ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"": Use ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>"" during the opposing End Phase, use two the tokens (choosing two that are not directly under the Extra Monster Zone) during your turn to summon ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" and change the type of whatever ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" points to into anything other the Beast (since the ""<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>"" token is Beast-type) or Dinosaur (since ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" is Dinosaur). Use the three monsters left on your side of the field to summon ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"", while still being able to choose a sizeable number of the archetype and not using up your Normal Summon nor any ""Fur Hire"" cards in the process. Another option featured in the deck is the use of the ""Sky Striker"" engine, which summons a token via ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones"">Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</a>"", then uses the token to summon ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a>"", who then recycles the card for another token which leaves you with a Warrior and a Machine monster and therefore an easy ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" after your Normal Summon.</p> <p>After you got enough of ""<a data-name=""Folgo, Justice Fur Hire"">Folgo, Justice Fur Hire</a>"" and his plays, you are more than welcome to go into other options like ""<a data-name=""Archnemeses Eschatos"">Archnemeses Eschatos</a>"" for an easy beater with an awesome effect, your archetypal big boy in ""<a data-name=""Rafale, Champion Fur Hire"">Rafale, Champion Fur Hire</a>"" with added negation or ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" for yet more draw and spam for further extension. The newer ""Tri-Brigade"" Extra Deck monsters can also help strengthening your board: ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade &lt;a data-name=&quot;Rugal the Silver Sheller&quot;&gt;Rugal the Silver Sheller&lt;/a&gt;"">Tri-Brigade </a><a data-name=""Rugal the Silver Sheller"">Rugal the Silver Sheller</a>"" can trigger the effects of your smaller ""Fur Hires"" during the opposing turn by being able to summon a Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged Beast monster from your hand while als weakening the opposing board if he leaves the field for whatever reason, meaning that using him fo further Link summons if possible. ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>"" can provide a sizeable amount of banishes if you play your cards right and have enough monsters to assemble, but in the worst case scenario he is still a 3000 ATK beater with one banish for free.</p> <p>Other than that the deck is filled with options that allow you to continue playing more monsters after your opponent's negates or even just to get more monsters ready. ""<a data-name=""Mayhem Fur Hire"">Mayhem Fur Hire</a>"", ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Rookie Fur Hire"">Rookie Fur Hire</a>"" all work in a number of situations and can provide playstarters if the first try was negated or if the effect were annulled.</p> <p>Granted, the deck itself is nowhere near competitive, but is still able to negate fairly competently while still being able to net an OTK once in a while.

Despite the fact that the ""Worm"" archetype came out during the early days of Duel Terminal, they are still a fairly solid deck in a more casual environment. While the archetype features 26 monsters, only a few of those are really worth playing, but those core monsters can pack quite a punch.</p> <p>""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>"" is your main searcher and will often be your first turn monster to set face-down for that fact. It obviously still searches if it does not survive an encounter with the opposing monsters, but with ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"" you can make sure that ""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>"" searches, lives to be used for Xyz and Link monsters, while your life points stay unharmed aswell. Swarming comes in form of ""<a data-name=""Worm Xex"">Worm Xex</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Worm Yagan"">Worm Yagan</a>"", the first one being the ""Worm"" version of a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"", while the other one can revive itself when ""<a data-name=""Worm Xex"">Worm Xex</a>"" is alone on the field. With ""<a data-name=""Worm Call"">Worm Call</a>"", you can easily summon cards like ""<a data-name=""Worm King"">Worm King</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>"", the first one being your main beater and a walking monster removal while the other one is a gimmick option that can nuke the opposing monster zones and potentially become the biggest beater you have access to. ""<a data-name=""Worm Zero"">Worm Zero</a>"" is an option to go into via ""<a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"", but the card is nothing to rely on every game (even though it might push ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>"" to new heights stat-wise). ""<a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>"" is the well-known Light handtrap and allows you to fight (and surprise) opponents.</p> <p>The backrow is filled with Stun options including ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" to keep Special summons in check (also, it has the handy effect of being useable twice), ""Solemns"" to keep the opposition from doing anything stupid and ""<a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>"" to punish the opponent for destroying your backrow. ""<a data-name=""W Nebula Meteorite"">W Nebula Meteorite</a>"" is a seriously useful card in combination with some ""Worms"" and a ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"", triggering ""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>'"" search effect and ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>'s"" nuking, then flipping everything down for another round, summoning a ""<a data-name=""Worm King"">Worm King</a>"" for free and then drawing a truckload of cards. Finally, the added ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" make the deck more versatile and quite a bit faster.</p> <p>""Worms"" are, despite my efforts to make them somewhat useable, still a rather weak archetype. However, I feel like this is a decent attempt on making them somewhat playable against other decks on the same power level. I also gave an entire archetype analysis a spin, which you can read on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/archetype-analysis-worm/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/archetype-analysis-worm/</a>.</p>"

Running this with my favorite spell card, Super Polymerization and a few easy to summon fusion cards (predaplants, trishula, starving dragon)  The rest of the extra deck is used primarily for their effects in the graveyard due to Disciple from Nadir and Dogmatika Maximus which allow you to discard cards from your extra deck.

Summon Psi-Reflector and show Assault Mode Activate in hand to target Assault Beast from the GY. Link both into Predaplant Verte Anaconda. Trigger its effect, paying 2000 LP, to pitch Red-Eyes Fusion, Dark Magician, and Red-Eyes B. Dragon to summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon from the Extra Deck.  2.

Obviously it's not meta, but it's more playable as a tier 3-2 deck.","This is not a fan-base deck, while making this deck I took into consideration the most useful Fortune lady monsters, spells, and traps while still maintaining the deck's main strategy which is synchro summon fortune lady every and the banished zone. It's more of a control based deck with a synchro/link toolbox in the ED. It can go both first and 2nd (if you open any handtrap) but it's recommended to go first with this deck.  This is the deck's core, in the side deck are only SPELLCASTER handtraps, you need to play at least 9 more spellcasters besides Fortune ladies so your fortune lady past's effect have enough resources to summon FL Every.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/DMPyal0"">https://imgur.com/DMPyal0</a>  &nbsp;  UPDATE No.1: I've switched a Rivalry of warlords and lightning storm out of the maindeck and side deck, those cards are not that great for this particular deck, mainly because the new replacements, both crackdown and royal decree are more versatile against meta and non-meta decks, also rivalry locks you down from summoning halqifibrax, accesscode, crystal wing, etc.  It does hurt the opponent, but in specific cases it hurts you more than them. (vs salamangreat, blue-eyes, etc.)  Royal decree is mostly against mystic mine and other heavy trap decks like traptrix, in the sidedeck we already have secret village which counters mystic mine a lot, but obviously, it's not enough.  I will later post a bunch of tech cards that can be used in this deck for future formats alongside the core of this deck so you guys can also tweak for yourselves this deck.  UPDATE No.2: added Triple Tactics talent to the deck, both upstart and Fortune lady rewind weren't needed. Monster reborn &gt; Rewind.  UPDATE No.3: swapped drolls for shifter, shifter hurts eldlich a lot, and because of Fortune lady past's effect, you can banish shifter to keep your GY empty, and if you have another copy in your hand, you can keep looping it for more than 4 turns with FL past. And because of this, I took out MR for Rewind, and replaced 3 Called by the grave for 3 Triple tactics talent."

This deck is both unexpected and powerful if givern a turn to set up. who wo,"The main strategy of the deck is to set up flood gates and get out 1 of the main Elementsabers, Lapauila or Molehu, then grind your opponent out of resources slowly but steadily. 1 of my favourite things about the deck is that with there GY attribute changing abilities it is easy to some the dreaded Dark Armed Dragon which still to this day is a powerful boss monster. Their in archetype final battle, Elemental Training, allows you to dodge targeting effects while also going into a new Elementsaber and protecting the field spell, Palace of the Elemental Lords. You don't need more than 2 brain cells to play this deck but it is somewhat funny watching your opponent struggle to a deck of kids in armour. all in all, it is a cheap and somewhat competitive deck that if they get the right support could easily become meta. If only they had a way to stop the defect of skipping your next Battle Phase. Thanks for reading bye."

The <strong>Shaddoll</strong> part of our deck is for beefing up our <strong>Crusadia Equimax</strong> with our <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions. There isn't a high number of <strong>Crusadia</strong> main deck monsters since we want to be able to beef up <strong>Equimax</strong> with Fusion monsters and not <strong>Crusadia</strong> monsters.  <strong>Reclusia</strong> isn't in the deck since we can just use things like<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> for removal and<strong> Forbidden Droplets</strong> for negations. If you really want, you could replace the one <strong>Leonis</strong> for one <strong>Reclusia</strong>. You need to have playable cards in your hand very often during your combos so we are playing <strong>Shaddoll Beast</strong> and <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>. <strong>Squamata</strong> can send <strong>Beast</strong> to get you your draw or send <strong>Hedgehog</strong> for material for <strong>El Shaddoll Fusion</strong>. <strong>Wendi</strong> and <strong>Ariel</strong> are purely for different attributes for <strong>Apkallone</strong>, but you can still use their grave effects. If you send <strong>Wendi</strong> you have have a expendable tribute for <strong>Equimax</strong>'s negation if you summon it to a zone he points to. One <strong>Crusadia Testament</strong> so as not to brick your hand with a useless card during the main phase. <strong>Shaddoll Schism</strong> is to make things like <strong>Construct</strong> and<strong> Winda</strong> on your opponent's turn if they survive.  Side Deck has <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> as another material for <strong>Construct</strong> and an interruption if necessary. <strong>Shaddoll Dragon</strong> is against Backrow Decks. <strong>Magicalized Fusion</strong> to get things like <strong>Winda</strong> out going first since for <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> to be at its best, your opponent has to have an extra deck monster on their field. <strong>Imperm</strong> for negations if needed.<strong> Red Reboot</strong> for Trap Decks. 2 more<strong> Schism</strong> for going first and you want to see it.  You never want to normal summon the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> part of your Deck. Your entire <strong>Crusadia</strong> combo depends on a normal summon of a <strong>Crusadia</strong> monster. A good hand should have at 2 <strong>Crusadia</strong> monsters and ways to do your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> plays. Once you get to <strong>Equimax</strong>, if you also have <strong>Maximus</strong> on the field, you've basically won if you can make your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions. The fusions you really should make are <strong>Apkallone</strong> and <strong>Winda</strong> since<strong> Apkallone</strong>'s materials are fairly simple to have onboard and <strong>Winda</strong> is a Floodgate. You kind of have to play with your hand with this deck."

This is not a literal play deck, but it is still playable. It just currently does way too much. A bad hand leads to too much stalling, which leads to not having enough to stop your opponent from disrupting your plays when finally getting them.</span>  <span>So what am I doing here? I'm combining 2 control themes into one. From testing, I can easily choose which control style for the situation. Rikka for unconventional control. Generaider’s for established, familiar, give and take-style of control. </span>  <span>My winning strategy is to control the board. Hit hard. Obviously, I am finding it hard to get around T1 unbreakable boards. But I find that the more Konami builds on Rikka Fairy archetype will lead them to being the go to deck-type to break those boards. Due to Flurries being such an under-rated, under appreciated and very strong card. </span>  <span>Lastly, I have not fully incorporated the ROTD additions. Strenna and IDP. Seeing as I've only played with them online and am still waiting on my priority 1st class snail mail so I can get my hands on them; to play with locals.</span>  <b>Rikka Fairy:</b><span> </span>  <span>The Rikka selection of cards are not set in stone. Due to my choosing so few Rikka spell/traps, I shouldn't play as many Mudans. Seeing as Strenna will bring in the element of recycling/recurring things from GY. </span>  <span>Also, Mudan is more for a pure Rikka heavy deck profile. Seeing as Glamour can target 2 Rikka Fairies of the same lv, if you pay tribute. Rather than just 1 Rikka Fairy.</span>  <span>I went with 2 Primula and 1 Cyclamen for level maintenance to go into whatever Rank plays the situation calls for. I mean, if played right, I can technically go into any rank between Rank 1 to 11. </span>  <span>Finally, I put 1 Rikka Petal in the mix. She's necessary but also not necessary at the same time. If I'm going for Jorm or True King, her recurrence is blocked due to them not being plant, but she can help recover when it comes to it. Also, she’s a good banish bait. </span>  <b>Generaider:</b><span> </span>  <span>I kept the Generaider side package short and added Trias to the package because Trias is the most amazing lv9 of all times. It's almost always live in hand or the graveyard. God forbid nothing happens to my Generaider tokens that aren't sniped. I can pop a unprotected card and draw 2 and have a lv9 body, on the board, for XYZ play and discard fodder to have it ready to do all over again. 1 copy of Boss Room because it is a hefty brick if it's already on set or the opponent plays around it.</span>  <span>I want to test out Trias at 1. Maybe 2. If you don't know what Trias Hierachia is; She is a lv9 that SS herself if you have X Fairy(-ies) on board. Tribute 1, she comes out. 2, destroy 1 card. </span><b>Non-targeting.</b><span> 3, draw 2 cards. Quick effect. I have bricked with her. Having 1 in hand. 1 on the field. 1 in the GY.</span>  <span>Mardel because… I mean, it’s Mardel! She fetches any plant. Any generaider card. For setup, for extending, recovery...</span>  <span>Loptr, is a playmaker who literally sees board play; start to finish.</span>  <span>I am considering adding Harr, due to his big body and effect. I would almost want to add Monstrosity, but I would start leaning towards a more pure Generaider deck. </span>  <b>Generic Plants:</b><span> </span>  <span>Lonefire is way too staple to not use. Also, helps Snowdrop bypass tributing restrictions in order to go into non-plant xyz plays.</span>  <span>Rose Lover for an extra SS and GY target for the opponent.</span>  <span>Rose Girl, for her extend-ability. Also, let me play around with Queen of Thorns for the lulz. She is kind of on the chopping block when I start downsizing. Still, her constant SS’ing herself and returning to my hand and lv4 status keeps her in contention to be a staple lv4 in a Rikka deck.</span>  <span>I dropped Evil Thorn. Too often I found myself opening with 2, sometimes 3 copies, which really defeats the purpose of playing it.</span>  <b>Spell/Traps:</b><span> As going with control; Solemn trap cards are necessary, seeing as Rikka and Generaider’s don't have SS3 killer traps outside Rikkas having Pollinosis. Since there are non plants in the deck, Pollinosis becomes a brick more often than it can actually be used.</span>  <span>Pot of choice is Avarice, to send my Rikka and Generaider’s back to the deck and draw 2. I found Avarice helps Strenna focus on recurring spell/trap cards. 3 feels bricky. Might drop to 2.</span>  <span>Kuji-Kiri Curse is fun. It’s ideal target is Trias Heirachia. </span>  <span>Foolish Burial has multiple targets to send to GY for plays.</span>  <span>Monster Reborn. Necessity. But cut-able. </span>  <span>Raigeki. It’s fun... Will be dropped. </span>  <b>Extra Deck:</b>  <span>The extra deck is not established. Mostly big scary boss monsters that, once hitting the field, become questionable win conditions.</span>  <span>Teardrop is a fun boss to have in the early game, going for an early to mid game win. Alongside Generaider’s and Trias hitting the field, Teardrop can get pretty big, due to tributing. Even counts for Flurry making your opponent tribute their non-plant monsters.</span>  <span>Kanzashi, is on the chopping block. She is more of a tech card. It's cool to steal from other GY's but… niche. Her effect does play well with Snowdrop and lead to extending your board. But it's abit slow.</span>  <span>Jormungar. Excellent boss. His Generaider title suits him. Unfortunately, he is very unprotected but… even every second of him being up is basically + in your favor, and if Harr is up… even more shenanigans. </span>  <span>True King, big bad boogeyman monster. Excellent floodgates. Good body. Good target for 87s effect. Disgusting when paired with Queen of Thorns. I mean, disgusting at the time that is.</span>  <span>Queen of the Night, just a beater, that can progressive get bigger the longer she is up or buff other bosses. +300 AP.</span>  <span>Ingunar for his SS4 effect. Sucks that it is actually SS1.</span>  <span>Super Jasmine. Because it would be crazy to not have her in a plant deck. Might drop her to 1, but 2 feels right for the moment.</span>  <span>Lastly, Alsei. I'll admit I don't really know how to use Sylvan cards. Never been a huge fan of the excavating, especially with Rikkas having lacked the ability to recur things from the GY. I'm definitely dropping Alsei soon. If I keep him, it will be because of Strenna and I will re-add Rosebell spell cards and Princessprite.</span>  <b>Side Deck:</b><span> This is not my actual extra deck. Just a bunch of ideas I have on hand, couple to-do items and shirt wish list cards. Those 15 cards are estimated at ~$500 usd. Whereas the 60 card main deck and 15 card extra deck is about $200-205. Luckily I sniped most of them when they were cheap(-er).</span>  <b>Overall:</b><span> </span>  <span>This deck is fun. Needs tweaking. Needs more. Will surprise your opponent and shake the confidence in some people. Best moment while playing this deck is telling your opponent ""Nope"".</span>  <b>FREE MY BOYS DANDYLION AND GLOW-UP!

I was using Spellbooks as my engine for BM for a while but wanted something new. With the help of Black Fang Magician and plenty of search support cards for Pendulum Magicians, it's quite easy to get Black Magicians on the field and resurrect them if they're taken out. Plus, the Pendulum Magicians second as great buffs for your Black Magicians and Extra Deck Cards. Bricking is possible, but doesn't happen often, and even when it does you can usually outlast your opponent until you start getting some heavy hitters on the field.

The Numeron engine is small and easy to fit into any deck not reliant on the extra, and Fortune Ladies actually generate a crazy amount of card advantage. Bricking is very, very rare.  &nbsp;  Monsters -  3x Numeron Wall - Activates your Numeron field spell from the deck, meaning you love to see this turn one. Also works as a Battle Fader going second.  3x Ash Blossom - It's 2020 Yugioh, this should be self explanitory.  3x Fortune Lady Light - When this card leaves the field via card effect, you get a free special from your deck. We have a bunch of ways to trigger this ourselves.  2x Fortune Lady Past - The tuner of the deck, letting you summon the Fortune Lady boss monster.  2x Fortune Lady Fire - When special summoned by a Fortune Lady card, it can target and destroy a monster your opponent controls. Not the greatest of removals, but still comes in handy.  1x Fortune Lady Wind - When normal summoned, allows you to destroy spell/traps on the field. You aren't going to find yourself normaling this often, and it's really just run for the name.  2x Fortune Lady Water - Pot of Greed in spellcaster form. When special summoned while you control a Fortune Lady, you get to draw two cards. This thing'll generate an insane amount of advantage.  1x Fortune Lady Dark - Allows you to special Fortune Ladies in the grave when it destroys cards by battle, mostly used as a beatstick and for the name.  2x Fortune Fairy Hikari - When drawn, you can special this card. It then allows you to send a monster you control to summon a level 1 spellcaster from the deck. Normally you'll be sending itself for a Light, but sometimes you'll be able to send Light and trigger her effect which is exciting. The summon condition doesn't sound very good, but you draw so many cards with this deck, it's really easy to trigger.  &nbsp;  Spell/Traps  2x Numeron Calling/3x Numeron Network - The rest of the Numeron engine  2x Spellbook of Secrets/3x Spellbook of Knowledge - A draw engine you can stick in any spellcaster deck, with an added upside. Knowledge will trigger Lights effect if she's on the field, allowing you to both draw two and special one. Depending on the board state, the special could be Water, allowing you to draw another two, etc etc. Lots of draws.  3x Fortune Vision - Mostly used as a searcher. Also works as protection through the banish effect, but only on your own turn really, which is less good. The other effect to reduce battle damage is annoying, but that's about it.  2x Fortune Lady Calling - Special a Fortune Lady if you already have one. Can be used to summon and trigger Water, or can be used to grab a Light/Past from the deck as an extender.  1x Fortune's Future - Return a banished Fortune Lady to the grave to draw two. You'll have a Fortune Lady banished most of the time, but I could only find room for one of these. Just more draw power.  2x Future Vision - One of the more annoying field spells in the game. The banish effect will trigger both parts of Fortune Vision, and shuts down a lot of decks that rely on a normal summon. Also triggers Light as soon as she's summoned, which is real nice. Unfortunately, the return effect is not a special summon, so it won't trigger Water.  1x Magicalized Fusion - You go through cards so fast in this deck, this is really just a free boss monster.  1x One for One - Can be used to summon Numeron Wall turn 1, and can also be used to grab Light or Past.  1x Fortune Lady Rewind - Really helps in getting that last extra damage. Banishing 5 with Magicalized Fusion, and then summoning them all back, leads to a big chunk of damage.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck -  Numeron Gates - Necessary for the Numeron engine. Combined with the field spell, will sometimes just win you games on their own.  2x Utopic Zexal - 2 is probably overkill, but I've had games where I've used both. The boss of the Numeron cards, and just stops your opponent from playing the game for multiple turns. If this card doesn't get hit at some point I'll be surprised.  2x Fortune Lady Every - Non targeting, Non destruction removal. She'll keep bringing herself back too, really annoying to deal with.  1x Quintet Magician - Really a free boss for a deck with so many names. You'll get the destruction effect more often than not, and has a crazy amount of attack and built in protection on top of everything else.  1x Black Rose - I've noticed this deck has issues removing monsters outside of Every and Fire effects, so I'm running this to compensate. You could probably easily find a replacement, but this card will come up. Also I really miss running Black Rose  1x Formula - Mostly used for the draw, Past is level 1, and we have 8 level 1 non tuner monsters. Formula can still be used to make both Every and Black Rose.  &nbsp;  I haven't been playing this deck for the longest of times, but hopefully you guys enjoy it as much as I have."

The ""B.E.S."" archetype features battleships whose level starts at 5 and therefore originally needed a lot of tribute summoning to get started. Fortunately, the Field Spell ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" was made around 2017, which allows the archetype to skip the slow method and simply put some space ships on the table. The ""B.E.S."" monsters themselves gain counters upon being summoned (with some members asking for Tribute Summons, while other member do not really care how they enter the field) which protects them from battle destruction for the cost of one counter per battle. They automatically destroy themselves upon battling without counters, but in fairness this does not happen that often.</p><p>The main combo of this deck is ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" plus ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"". The Field Spell boosts the stats, gives added protection, searches the other part of the combo in form of ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" upon entering the field, gives extra counters and allows you once per turn to summon an extra ""B.E.S."" monster from your hand. ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" will then search out members of the archetype during the End Phase of a turn you lost monsters, which you can use to the fullest by blasting the field and ending up resource-positive, while the opponent took an actually blow to their board state.</p><p>The core of the deck is made out of three copies of ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Blaster Cannon Core"">B.E.S. Blaster Cannon Core</a>"", ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-3"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-3</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-2"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-2</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Blaster Cannon Core"">Blaster Cannon Core</a>"" is absolutely fantastic, can be Special summoned at almost all stages of the game and gives the deck another sizeable beater for the OTK strategy. ""<a data-name=""Big Core MK-3"">Big Core MK-3</a>"" has a less useful summon mechanic than ""<a data-name=""Blaster Cannon Core"">Blaster Cannon Core</a>"" but recycles ""B.E.S."" monsters from the graveyard for more longevity. ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-2"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-2</a>"" is slightly worse than the other two, but is still a solid beater who can be Special summoned via ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" and Normal summoned via its own effect. One ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Tetran"">B.E.S. Tetran</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Crystal Core"">B.E.S. Crystal Core</a>"" are also part of the ""B.E.S."" line-up of this deck: They will both enter the field with only one counter when summoned via ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"", but they can remove the counter to pop backrow or change battle position respectively. There is also one copy of ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" in the deck which is mainly used as another Special Summon option while also giving access to ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>"", and two copies of ""<a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=71197066"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/71197066.jpg"" data-card=""71197066"" data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher</span></a>""&nbsp; as a useful option to summon that also provides spot removal.</p><p>On the ""Kaiju"" front, I run one ""<a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a>"", who will all mostly end up on the opposing board either via their own tribute effect or via ""<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>"" (which triggers ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" if you blast ""B.E.S."" monsters with it). The two copies of ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" are for my side of the board and are one of the ways to OTK the opponent together with any almost any ""B.E.S."" monster and a ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"".</p><p>Talking about ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"": The same fact that applied to ""<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>"" also applies to ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"", meaning you can buff your monsters, wait for the End Phase if you did not manage to kill and then simply build another board via ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"". Other generic options the deck sports are ""<a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>"", since you almost lose nothing by negating the effects of your monsters, while the opponent has good chances of being stopped by it, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for more swarming and kill potential, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=49238328"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49238328.jpg"" data-card=""49238328"" data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</span></a>"" as a draw spell with pretty much no drawback in this deck, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=70368879"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/70368879.jpg"" data-card=""70368879"" data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</span></a>"" as one blank card, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=54693926"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/54693926.jpg"" data-card=""54693926"" data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</span></a>"" as a board-breaking tool, and both ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=73628505"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/73628505.jpg"" data-card=""73628505"" data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</span></a>"" and ""<a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=89208725"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/89208725.jpg"" data-card=""89208725"" data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</span></a>"" for easier access to the Field Spell.</p><p>The Extra Deck is not that important in ""B.E.S."" since you will be mostly relying on your Main Deck monsters to do the damage, but one can fit some options into it that might prove worthwhile once in a blue moon. ""<a data-name=""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" are all in the deck for their non-destruction removal effects with alternating ranks of 9, 8 and 7, allowing you to use whatever combination you can access the easiest in any given situation. Some of the Link Monsters are ""<a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a>"" as a beater, the ""Knightmares"" for backrow and monster removal, ""<a data-name=""Pentestag"">Pentestag</a>"" as an option to give a beater piercing damage, ""<a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a>"" for her bounce effect, ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" for further stat boosts and ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" for those rare cases when you lose your Field Spell but still have monsters to work with and try to turn the game back around.</p><p>That should sum everything up.

Your aim with this deck is to win by Catapult Turtle tributing a 22000+ Cyberse Clock Dragon for FTK. This is achieved with my optimised strategy using Code Talker link climbing.  Key card is Cynet Codec, which lets you search out any Cyberse from your deck with the same attribute as a Code Talker you just summoned. Hard once per turn of course. You search out monsters that can special summon themselves or other monsters easily, search from deck or link off from hand, like Lady Debug, Widget Kid, Code Generator, Backup Secretary, Mathmechs, etc. But do NOT use the effect of Transcode Talker while you are Link climbing!  To have Codec in hand to get the loop started, you have several key cards. The first one is Micro Coder that allows you to search a Cynet spell from your deck when used as Link material, and it can link itself from the hand. Next you have Lady Debug, which can search Micro Coder. Then Cynet Mining, which can search Lady Debug. Altogether that's eleven ways of having Codec in your starting hand, twelve if you play Debug at 3 and 13 if you play One for One.  Then you also want to have Clock Wyvern in your hand to fuse with a Link monster to get Clock Dragon. You might have it in your starting hand or get in one of the ways described above, and off of the link summon of Excode with Codec on field. You can use its on-field effect to make a token, but don't link off Clock Wyvern itself! Cynet fusion is gotten by getting a Clock Spartoi - doesn't matter which monsters you use, you want all your Link monsters in GY anyways.  Then continue to Link summon until you have two preferably high link-rating monsters on field like Bomber Dragon or Avramax, and link into Clock Lizard. Use its effect to return the Clock Dragon you linked off before into your Extra Deck, and fuse Wyvern with as many Link monsters in your graveyard as possible, so that their link rating reaches your remaining deck size (usually ~22-25), and mill the rest of your deck.  Seyfert returns Levianeer to hand, and because we didn't use Transcode's effect before, we can special summon it by banishing 3 LIGHT monsters from GY. This then allows us to special summon Catapult Turtle from GY via Levianeer, and tribute Clock Dragon for 11000+ burn damage turn 1.  As it turns out, this deck is surprisingly consistent, and you can add any cards that go well with the special summon-theme of the deck, like Cache Eve L2 or Linkslayer.  &nbsp;"

Deck idea formulated after 4 Exodia encounters which i lost close. First Submission have fun with th,"Play this deck if you are sure that you go up against Exodia or are in a Tag Duel - it is for fun and allows you to bypass strong monsters.  Main strategy:  <strong>Nightmare Horse</strong> can attack your opponent directly but has only <strong>ATK 500</strong> therefore you have the equip spell cards <strong>United We Stand</strong> and <strong>Mage Power</strong> which you can search via <strong>Armory Call</strong> and <strong>Hidden Armory. </strong>Exodia decks come usually with the Field spell <strong>Mystic Mine</strong> which prevents you from activating monster effects and declare an attack at all therefore you  have the monster <strong>Gate Blocker </strong>to negate it beforehand which your opponent has, as many Exodia decks have usually a lot of drawing and defensive but no offensive power, no counter for.  <strong>Sangan's</strong> effect can be used to search for the monsters having <strong>ATK 1500 and lower</strong> which is tha case for the more defensive monsters with the attritype DARK which will be used as material for <strong>Dark Armed Dragon</strong> and <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer Foolish Burial </strong>will help you in that regard. For the course of the duel you should keep track of which parts of Exodia are in the deck of your opponend as chaos <strong>Lullaby of Obedience</strong> can be used to get your hands on one part of the 5 required pieces the opponent decides if you add it to your hand or special summon it.  Secondary strategy:  <strong>Ojama Trio, Ojama Duo, Ground Collapse</strong> and <strong>Soul Exchange</strong> are here to either block your opponent monster zones or get rid of face up monsters by tributing them and summoning a monster to your side. I decided against <strong>Kaiju's</strong> for that aspect.

Opening with Machina Reployment opens up another line of play by giving your the additional monster to go into Scrap Wyvern. This means you can get Machina Citadel on board in addition to the standard endboard, which represents another form of disruption on the opponent's turn.  Urgent Schedule, Tuning, Triple Tactics Talent, Crossout Designator, along with any other 1-card Halqifibrax enablers can be included in the deck depending on the format."

The main draw engine of the deck is having Endymion, the Master Magician (Effect Monster) in grave or hand, and building spell counters on your Magical Citadel of Endymion ( Endymion's Lab becomes Magical Citadel on the field) so you can remove 6 spell counters from them and special summon Endymion and get a spell card from grave, usually the best target is Wonder Wand, as with this combo you special Endymion get wonder wand equip send to grave then draw 2 and extend your combo with more spells to draw even more cards in a turn. Endymion's Lab is a COMBO MULTIPLIER for Spell counters, so for each copy you up your spell counter multiplier from 1x, to 2x, to 3x PER SPELL CARD!!!! And you get a free spell card just for special summoning Endymion so your already halfway to ANOTHER DRAW 2 CARDS when you activate that one free spell. I have drawn my entire deck on turn one on multiple occasions with only a 2x Multiplier. You can increase your combo multiplier by 1x per turn (Can only activate Endymion's Lab once per turn) so try to avoid picking this card up for that precious negate if possible. Its secondary effect can be used to summon Endymion, the Mighty Master Magician from deck by removing 6 spell counters from field when any spellcaster type monster is destroyed by battle, or you can summon reflection for the disruption/bounce and a search if its destroyed."

Not letting your opponent have a turn at all.,"<span>This deck has 2 main goals: the far more reliable Megalith lockdown with Bethor on deck, and the far more disrespectful ""Turn Skip"". </span>  <span>In either case, you want to find a way to start summoning Megalith Ophiel and/or Megalith Hagith to start searching for more cards to combo further and build towards summoning Gallant Granite to search for Block Dragon. If you summon Gallant Granite into an Extra Monster Zone, you can link it off into Gravity Controller to easily put it and its other material into the GY to be banished for Block Dragon's summon. It's also better to summon Block Dragon from the GY after using Megalith Phul or Megalith Unformed to send it from your hand as Ritual tribute.</span>  <span>Megalith Phul is easily the best card this archetype has going for it. Being level 2 makes it easy to summon with Megalith Unformed (which is why I feel only 2 copies are necessary), it can ritual summon other Megalith monsters <em>from your deck</em> without even having to tribute itself off (and this is a quick effect!), and it can modulate its own level, so if you <em>did</em> want to have Phul use itself as tribute, you could potentially make it level 8 first to then summon <em>any</em> Megalith you want from your deck with Phul being the sole tribute.</span> <p>Megalith Lockdown</p> <p><span>Megaltith Phul is the key to the more lockdown oriented approach. The goal is to combo for as long as possible to load your GY up with as many different Megalith's as possible (just beware of Nibiru), and end with Phul on board (best if you have a lvl 8 Megalith in hand, and Aratron on board, or have just made Phul lvl 8 by its effect). Then, during your opponent's turn, use Phul's effect to summon a Megalith Bethor from your deck or hand to wipe out your opponent's board whenever you see the opportunity to do the most damage. </span></p> <span>Adding to the ""lockdown"" nature of this strategy is Barrier Statue of Drought. Being 1 of only 3 normal summons in the deck (the other 2 being 2 copies of Manju), you will likely be able to search for the Barrier Statue along with another lvl4 Megalith off of Block Dragon's effect and Normal Summon it to lock your opponent into Special Summoning only Earth monsters (something that barely has any effect at all on this deck). Normally Barrier Statues are pretty easy to deal with, just requiring you to use your Battle Phase to attack over their measly 1000 ATK/DEF, but if your opponent attempts to move to their battle phase, you can blow away whatever they've summoned by using Megalith Phul to summon Megalith Bethor, leaving them stuck under the Barrier Statue lock.</span> <p>""Turn Skip""</p> <span>This strategy relies on a particular quirk within the rules of the game regarding the Main Phase 2, namely: you cannot proceed directly to a Main Phase 2 without first entering/conducting your Battle Phase. If you have no Battle Phase, you don't get a Main Phase 2, and if you don't get a Main Phase 1 <em>or</em> a Battle Phase/Main Phase 2, you essentially get no turn.</span>  <span>To achieve this, all you need to do is summon Amorphactor Pain the Imagination Dracoverlord (all level 4 Megalith monsters can summon <em>any</em> ritual monster from your hand, not just Megaliths) and set Thunder of Ruler.</span>  <span>Even if you don't manage to get both pieces of this combo together, Amorphactor Pain is still a beefy level 8 Earth ritual monster that can be rather easily summoned or used as material, and it still skips your opponent's Main Phase 1 while also shutting down all Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters on the field. Even Thunder of Ruler can be handy in providing extra protection for your Barrier Statue of Drought, preventing your opponent from simply attacking over it to remove the restriction on their Special Summons, if you find it in your opening hand without Amorphactor Pain.</span>"

Plufines the Unconventional Commander is super great in Metaphys, not only it banishes Ascension for Assymetaphys as starter, it also sets the trap banished as recovery if it's destroyed by your opponent. <strong>All we need is to banish Daedalus and Nephthys</strong>, so we maxed out the starter cards such as Daedalus, Nephthys, Plufines, Aloof, Crossout, Gold Sarc, and Assymetaphys. <strong>Nephthys</strong> will add Daedalus (monster nuke)/Nephthys (backrow nuke), <strong>Daedalus</strong> will send Tyrant, and Tyrant will ss Metaphys from hand on our next turn to nuke, it means we have to juggle our resource between Daedalus/Nephthys/Tyrant.  We don't run Ragnarok as it is a gamble, only mills 3 (very lackluster), and its second effect is a win-more effect. Decoy Dragon as extra body, only run 1 cus it's super easy for opponent to play around it. Also if we have excessive resource, we can banish more Tyrant/Nephthys as extra body/search.  Pros: Good consistency for nuking, big staple slot, banishing is a super strong mechanic.  Cons: First turn board is weak.  PS: all the ""old monster"" name mentioned is their Metaphys retrain."

Canonically, they were made to fight against the ""Worm"" archetype which is reflected in the game by their anti-Light Attribute effects and certain cards working specifically against face-down cards. While the idea is not that terrible, the archetype certainly started rather weak and got only worse over time due to power-creep. However, I tried to make the most out of a deck which sole reason of existence is to fight the Light Attribute.</p> <p>The first card I need to talk about is ""<a data-name=""DNA Transplant"">DNA Transplant</a>"". There are some very good Light Attribute archetypes like ""Lightsworn"", ""Cyber Dragon"", ""Blue-Eyes"" and many more, but since it is only one out of six Attributes in the game (I am aware that Divine exists, but I rarely encounter a deck that focusses on that Attribute) chances are that you will have to play against decks that you have no inherent bonus against. ""<a data-name=""DNA Transplant"">DNA Transplant</a>"" was played in a previous version of this deck since it allows you to transform the opposing monsters into Light Attribute, but I opted to skip the card due to not being consistent or searchable and instead added options to give to opponent the Light monsters I am playing.</p> <p>Speaking of which, in case the opponent has Light monsters you can work with a few nice options. ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Quarantine"">Ally of Justice Quarantine</a>"" flatout prohibits the Special summon of Light monsters, ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Core Destroyer"">Ally of Justice Core Destroyer</a>"" has weak ATK but destroys any Light monster without breaking a sweat and the Extra Deck ""Allies"" can also help getting the job done.</p> <p>Both ""<a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a>"" are Light Attribute and can be switched onto the opposing board via ""<a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a>"" while still triggering their effects for you if they get destroyed. ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" removes threats you cannot get past normally, while also being fairly easy to beat via ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Core Destroyer"">Ally of Justice Core Destroyer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a>"". Finally, ""<a data-name=""Leeching the Light"">Leeching the Light</a>"" is one of many ATK boosting options, allowing you to either use the opposing monsters to fuel your monsters' ATK stats via correct matchup or enabling the effect yourself by putting either a ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>""/""<a data-name=""Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju"">Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</a>"" onto the opponent's side of the field or switch monsters via ""<a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a>"".</p> <p>In reverse, most of your other monster options are Dark Attribute, which is also something this deck tries to make use of. ""<a data-name=""Dark Salvo"">Dark Salvo</a>"" can fetch another monster from the graveyard and gives you an easy way into Link 2 or Level 7 Synchro monsters. ""<a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a>"" is the second ATK booster to talk about, giving your monsters battle protection once per turn, further swarming upon destroying something and even gaining ATK bonuses by taking damage in battle. The last effect can also be triggered intentionally by ramming whatever you have available into the summoned ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" and giving your attacker the difference as attack power for the cost of your life points. The copies of ""<a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a>"" give you more sizeable bodies upon losing monsters.</p> <p>Naturally, there are some generic options aswell. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" means board clearing and an empty front row normally causes massive damage, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is obviously for monster revival, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" provides some swarming and the vast amounts of Levels in the deck makes hitting the right number rather difficult and ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>"" are there for consistency reasons. The three copies of ""Limiter Removal"" give the deck the option of threatening OTKs on a regular basis.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is really just an extension of your Main Deck, which features options that are nice to have but not always needed. ""<a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>"" gives ATK boosts, ""<a data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</a>"" searches anything you want from your deck monster-wise, ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" is another option to force the Light Attribute onto a monster, ""<a data-name=""Platinum Gadget"">Platinum Gadget</a>"" is more floating and pretty much serves as an option if you have to go into something in your Extra Deck but have no good option to use otherwise. The ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" is an amazing board-clears and easily makeable via ""<a data-name=""Black Salvo"">Black Salvo</a>"". Lastly, ""<a data-name=""Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf"">Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf</a>"" can turn one of your Machine monsters into an instant-killing attacker if the right ATK boosts are available. The two ""Ally of Justice"" Extra Deck monsters are choices you can go into as I mentioned, but they are in all fairness rather situational.</p> <p>While I think that this is pretty close to the ceiling of what can be done with ""Ally of Justice"", it has to be said that the archetype is still rather weak and the deck is pretty bricky, since none of the archetypal cards features any form of good searching or even solid interaction with its own archetype. However, this does not mean that one cannot build decks with them. If you want to know more about the archetype, feel free to visit the article on my blog: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/01/09/archetype-analysis-ally-of-justice/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/01/09/archetype-analysis-ally-of-justice/</a></p>"

A pure Blackwing Deck that mixes up just slightly.,"So, this is my take on a pure Blackwing Synchro deck.  Main plays here obviously revolve around the use of Auster the South Wind and Simoon the Poison Wind. <ul>  	<li>Simoon is your main combo starter, if he and any other Blackwing are in your hand, you can banish another Blackwing to grab a Black Whirlwind from your deck, which will allow you to search Auster (or any other Blackwing you want to grab from deck to extend your combo). This not only provides you an easy search, since Simoon's 1600 attack points will allow you to search just about every other Blackwing in the deck besides Bora the Spear and Kris the Crack of Dawn, but you will be able to normal summon whatever you searched because Simoon's effect does not take up your turn's normal summon.</li>  	<li>Auster can not only bring back any one of your level 4 or lower Blackwings, but has a secondary effect that works in tandem with Blackwing Armor Master, Blackwing Full Armor Master, or even Black-Winged Dragon, for the cost of banishing it from the GY. Bear in mind that Auster cannot be special summoned at all (It shares this trait with Blackwing Blizzard the Far North). Auster also works well with the 3 copies of Allure of Darkness since it will summon your Blackwing banished by that effect.</li> </ul> There is no Go-To combo for this deck, as it's meant to be more versatile than a standard combo deck, which is why there's a large variety in the Synchros here.  Small tips and tricks other than the Simoon/Auster plays: <ul>  	<li>Foolish Burial is meant for Vayu the Emblem of Honor or Zephyros the Elite. Vayu is used to Synchro summon from the GY (usually with Bora, Kris, or Zephyros to create Blackwing Gram the Shining Star or Assault Blackwing Sohaya the Rainstorm, which, if you have a lvl 7 such as Chidori the Rain Sprinkling or Raikiri the Rain Shower on the field already, that's an easy setup to Accel Synchro Summon Onimaru the Divine Thunder).</li>  	<li>If you put Zephyros in the GY, it's best to use his effect on a face up Black Whirlwind, or Gale the Whirlwind/Bora the Spear in order to resurrect him, since both Gale and Bora have no limit on their special summons.</li>  	<li>Using any two main deck monsters to summon Raidraptor Wise Strix, use its effect to pull out Zephyros the Elite from your deck for easier combo extension, as opposed to Bora or Kris.</li>  	<li>Blackwing Breeze the Zephyr, upon being searched by Black Whirlwind, can immediately special summon itself.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave is meant for Ash Blossoms or Ghost Ogres that try to stop your Black Whirlwind.</li>  	<li>Blizzard + Harmattan can create a lvl 6 (Nothung the Starlight) which then extends your combos since he gives you an additional normal summon.</li>  	<li>Twin Twisters/MST is simple and effective Spell/Trap control. In the case of Twin Twisters it's mostly good to discard Zephyros or Vayu for their GY effects.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Here's hoping we get some new Blackwing cards in the near future :&gt; They have a lot of potential!  &nbsp;"

The ideal play with this deck revolves around pitching either Bigfoot! or Thunderbird! off of the effect of Tribrigade Ceras to Special Summon it from the hand and triggering the effects of the Danger! monsters to remove the appropriate face-up or set threat  on the field while simultaneously filling the GY with Link material for the effects of our Tribrigades.

Cards such as Liquid Soldier, Solid Soldier, Blazeman, and Summoner Monk give you an extra boost to your speed. The magic and trap cards are designed to summon or recall as many monsters as possible to make even more fusions. EH Ocean is the engine of this deck, because it allows you to return any monster in your hand or in the extra deck (except the 2 XYZ and 2 non-HERO monsters) even if in the GY. The third copy of Ocean is in the side deck because liquid soldier allows you to summon any monster of level 4, or lower, specially. All elemental hero fusions don't have specific monster names to summon them, so all available monster cards can be used."

Time Thief:  Regulator is your go to card because he can special 2 Time Thief monsters. Depending on your hand you will have to adapt, but most of the times you will be able to get enough monsters on the field to xyz.  Link summon into Bujinki to then special redoer, or go into redoer immediately, again, depending on the situation. Try to use Chronorecorder as material, banish redoer and bring back Chrono on the field. At this point you should still be able to special something (either a dogmatika or a Time thief), use them as material for Perpetua.  Redoer comes back at end phase.  Use Perpetua to give material to Redoer (Time Thief Flyback) and special a time thief from grave (best option is Time Thief Winder because his effect will activate and you can add a Time Thief card to hand.) You can use this oppurtunity to get a Negate/Time Thief Retrogade but this is completely up to you. Use Redoer to interrupt, or get rid of dangerous monsters. Also more draw power.  Dogmatika:  Dogmatika Ecclesia is a really good card that gets you another dogmatika card in hand. She also is a level 4 so she can be used as material. Dogmatika Fleurdelis is a good handtrap to have in hand that can also boost your other Dogmatika Monsters. The goal is to get Maximus on the field to use the grave effects of your extra deck.  You can either use Fossil Warrior Skull Knight or Elder Entity N'tss to destroy cards from the field, or use Titaniclad the Ash Dragon to special or add dogmatika to your hand. (You can special Ecclesia and her effect will activate)  Shaddoll:  The goal here is to block your opponent with Winda. Using Dogmatika Maximus or Dogmatika Punishment you can send Shaddoll Apkalone to grave to get Shaddoll Schism.

Hyper Librarian and Junk Speeder to draw essentially your whole deck on your first turn.,"I'm not very good at writing out combo guides, especially for decks like this that don't have one big long combo, instead using a bunch of smaller combos that string together, so bear with me.  The combo starts with getting a Junk Synchron in your hand and a non-tuner level 2 in the grave. You can achieve this easiest by using Quickdraw or Junk Converter to send the card, and opening Tuning, Junk Converter, or just Junk Synchron itself. From there, summon a level 2, Synchron Carrier lets you summon Junk Synch, Caligo summons itself when Junk Synch is on the field, and Doppelwarrior summons itself when Junk Synchron revives a monster. Next, go into Junk Speeder,  summoning another Junk Synchron and a Jet Synchron. From there, summon Hyper Librarian, then turn Jet Synchron and Junk Speeder into Stardust Charge Warrior, drawing one from Hyper Librarian and one from Charge Warrior.  The combo is pretty fluid from then on, with it really not having any one defined set of cards.

Dark World Deck 2020,"The strategy of this deck is simple. Summon a ton of cards while also drawing a ton of cards to dig for your main combo pieces ultimately creating an extremely oppressive board that has only a couple weaknesses. Ideally you want to open a lot of dangers and if you don't your combo can be cut short before you can really get started. That is the inherent weakness of the deck. However, this doesn't happen all that often unless you are having really bad luck with getting your dangers sniped or if your opponent has a lot of hand traps.  The combo pieces you want to dig for are Cyber-stein and plaguespreader. Best case scenerio you get to hold onto your normal summon until you draw cyber-stein but sometimes you will be forced to normal summon something else like armageddon knight or plaguespreader. This is not a big deal because you can summon the cyber-stein off of saryuja's effect. Usually the first monster I summon from the extra deck is Dugares the Timeless. He is easy to summon since there are so many level 4 monsters in the deck. You are almost always going to activate Dugares' first effect, the one that lets you draw 2 and discard for non-cost. This effect is SO good in this deck because the discard will allow you to get a dark world effect if you discard it. If you have a Broww the Hunstman in hand you want to discard that, giving you another draw. After that just summon more dangers until you have 4-5 monsters on field so you can summon Saryuja. If you had 5 monsters on field try to leave a level 4 on field. This will allow you to use saryujas effect to summon plaguespreader from hand (if you drew it or had it already). You can also summon plaguespreader from the GY so don't worry if it ends up there. Once you have Saryuja, a level 4, and Plaguespreader on field, you can go ahead and link Saryuja off for Linkross. You want to summon 3 tokens upon activating linkross effect. This will now allow you to summon Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys and DRAW 4 CARDS off its effect. By now you will probably have at least one beginning of the end or pot of avarice in hand so now it is time to dig for Cyber-Stein. Just keep summoning and drawing cards until you get Cyber-Stein. You can even use Pot of Avarice to put Saryuja back in your extra deck to summon it again to dig for Cyber-Stein thus also granting you a free way to special summon it. Sometimes Cyber-Stein will be towards the bottom of your deck so my rule of thumb is if you have under 10 cards left in your deck it is best to just give up on it and settle for ending on Apollousa Bow of the Goddess, Ravenous Croc, and Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If you are able to grab Cyber-Stein, you are going to use its effect to summon Naturia Exterio. This card is very strong as it pretty much lets you negate half the game since it negates both spells and traps and is not once per turn or even once per chain. You just have to make sure that your deck has enough cards to put out enough negates without decking out.  Sorry if this description is confusing but it is kind of hard to make a step by step for this deck since it is all about random drawing and luck. Just test it out and you will eventually understand how to play it efficiently. Also, you can do the draw 4 combo by using Genex Ally Birdman and another monster to summon Crystron Halqifabrax and use its effect to summon Plaguespreader. Now you just need 2 more monsters on board to make Saryuja and then use its effect to summon a level 4.  If you have any questions, please feel free to message me!"

There's still a lot of room for improvement to the deck, even with just the current card pool, and I was excited to see Dogmat","Eldlich deck running the Dogmatika engine to hate on the extra deck. A bunch of Rotas let you put El Shaddoll Apkallone into the GY to find the new trap, thus setting up Winda and maybe an extra negate. Forbidden Droplet gives us a spell speed 4 way to help shut down a board full of negates in the high end, and also the benefit of pitching Eldlich cards is pretty high. Eldlich numbers are pretty standard, Extravagance and Magicians' Souls work together to gather card advantage, and no longer requires bricks since Dogmatika monsters are spellcasters.  The extra deck includes a few different packages. There isn't a lot of room for hand traps in the deck, so I'm running packages of 6. Nibiru and Dark Ruler are for combo matchups, though you can also run a combo of Dark Ruler and Forbidden Droplet for Spell Speed 4 negation. Effect Veiler can come in as a generic hand trap, which is generally useful in stopping the opponent's turn, usually alongside Imperm. Lightning Storm, Red Reboot, and Anti-Magic Arrows are for backrow matchups, Eldlich, Altergeist, Guru, to stop their traps, though some Eldlich decks must be treated as combo decks instead. I'd like Cosmic and D.D. Crow for the mirror, but hating on the extra deck and making Winda should help against combo variants, and hopefully the high consistency helps pull ahead against more pure control variants."

Do your best everyone!","The core of the Rock deck has remained the same, but there are some new cards to add to the pool, such as Miracle Rupture and Koa'ki Meiru Supplier. Supplier is a clear upgrade over the other janky generic Earth Rock monsters, but Rupture to send Revival Golem might actually be worse than just running Unexpected Dai, since the Golem isn't a tuna. On the other hand, you can use it as an extender mid-combo, which isn't an option with Unexpected Dai, and you can still build ridiculous boards off of just Gallant Granite.  The other new option is Forbidden Droplet, which gives a spell speed 4 way to get through multiple monster effects at the cost of cards from the hand. Seems like an immediate going second staple in the side deck, and looks main deckable in a lot of circumstances.  The deck still ends on the same(ish) boards, a bunch of lines of interaction plus maybe Abyss Dweller, hopefully I:P with Block Dragon for fun and profit. With Droplet in the Meta I couldn't see Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos as quite as good an option anymore, but maybe I'm overthinking things, since I'm not sure Dweller fares better against the card."

Come here if you want to beat Eldlich and Rocks &#x1f440;,"With the newly added Archetype Dogmatika from the Rise of the Duelist Expansion also comes the new strategy ""Dogmatika Invoked"". Already being a top tier deck in the OCG it may be worth a try to also try it in the TCG.  The Invoked part of the Deck focusses highly around getting out Aleister. You can search him by Magical Meltdown, which also prevents the negation or interruption of your fusion summons. By normal summoning Aleister you can add the Spell Card Invocation. This can be used to fusion summon the Fusion Monsters. First of all, after normal summoning Aleister, the first thing you always do, is to Link summon Almiraj and then Link summon Secure Gardna. Like that you have the needed requirements for Invoked Mechaba, which should be your priority when going first.  The Dogmatika part of the Deck focusses more on putting Monsters from your Extra Deck on to the Graveyard to get out your Main Deck Monsters. Ecclesia is the card that can search you any other Dogmatika Card by normal summoning her or by special summoning her when a Monster special summoned from the Extra Deck is on the field. Maximus can be a great card to get 2 monsters from the Extra Deck into your Graveyard, while also forcing your opponent to put 2 in their graveyard. Fleur de Lis is best searched by Ash Dragon in the End Phase, because if you special summon her, she can negate the effects of one of your Opponents Monsters. Punishment can be good for clearing two monsters at once by first of all dumping N'Tss into the graveyard and afterwards with the effect of N'Tss also destroying one of the Opponents Monsters. With Nadir you should always add whatever the situation needs. If you have no Ecclesia I would suggest always getting her, in order for you to search another Dogmatika Card after searching her and therefore getting even more cards into the graveyard.  The Last Part of the Deck is the Shaddoll part. It is small but still very important! With any of your Dogmatika cards you can dump Apkallone into your Graveyard activating her effect to search you a Shadoll Schism. If you have then another Dark Monster on your field or your graveyard and the Apkallone still in the Graveyard you can proceed to special summon Winda in your oppponents turn, which prevents him from special summoning more than once.  Next up, I will explain why I put the Extra Deck monsters into the Deck like I did: <table>  <tr> <td>El Shaddoll Apkallone</td> <td>Like I already said, she is the searcher for Shadoll Schism so you can Summon out Winda</td> </tr> <tr> <td>El Shaddoll Winda</td> <td>Winda is very easy to get out in this Deck. You just need a Dogmatika card and one other Dark Monster (what Aleister coincidentally is). Apkallone also forces you to discard a card after activating her effect, so if you draw the Shaddoll Beast you can pitch it, draw a card and also get Winda. So much with only one card!</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Elder Entity N'Tss</td> <td>It is just a great card to pitch in your opponents turn with Punishment. Its 2500 ATK gives it a great variety of cards to destroy with Punishment and after that lets you destroy even another card!</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Augoeides</td> <td>Some play this card at 2, but I really do not like that. If necessary you can cycle it with Omega but in my opinion it does not see enough play to be worth the 2 slots. At one it is really good if you want to clear one card of your Opponents field easily and against some decks, they can not comprehend having to destroy the first special summoned card of theirs and cannot play around it. Great floodgate if you play against the right decks. Also really easy to get out later in the game if you have many Fusion Monsters in your Graveyard.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Mechaba</td> <td>Mechaba is the best Invoked card out their! You have a theoretical omni negate with only 1 card! Aleister into Almiraj into Secure Gardna gives you the needed materials and Aleister even searches you the Invocation. Because often your Mechaba gets Called or you have at the moment no easy way of recycling it, you really want to play 2 of them. Also you can get out 2 of them sometimes and they are only once per copy so you have 2 omni negates at once.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Purgatrio</td> <td>This is just the card for you to easy board wipe your Opponents monsters and often to OTK him. It is also very easy to get out with just Aleister and Almiraj. Nothing special, just a good card.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</td> <td>This card is just there for you to add in your End Phase after pitching him with Nadir, Punishment or Maximus a copy of Fleur de Lis for the great interruption in your Opponents turn.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PSY-Framelord Omega</td> <td>This card is a great way of recycling your already pitched cards. Also you can side in Gamma and Driver so you can sometimes even bring him out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Wind Pegasus @Ignister</td> <td>Good for interruption, if your Opponent somehow destroys one of your cards but even better in stopping OTK's. When your Opponents tries to, for example, kill you with Borrelsword, he has to first of all kill one of your monsters, which gives you the window to bounce him back to the Extra Deck to live one more turn.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aleister the Invoker of Madness</td> <td>You do not know how many times I have the situation of being able to summon something with my  Invocation but I have no Aleister. Well that is why I put this card in. Of course you cannot just pitch him with Dogmatika cards and proceed to summon your Invoked cards, but still, I really often had the situation where this guy gave me the Aleister I needed. Also he is a backup when I banished again all of my Aleisters with Pot of Desires lol.</td> </tr>  </table> For Handtraps I chose Ash Blossom (3x), Ghost Ogre (2x) and Impermanence (3x) because I think they are the best working in this Deck but also in this format. You can easily swap them out like you want. The same goes for the Side Deck, only Gamma and Driver I would really keep if you want to play Omega, it gives you so much more value. If you want to, you can drop the Omega, Gamma and Driver and instead put Construct into the Main Extra Deck to have another target for Schism. I chose to put her into the Side Deck because in some Match ups she can be really really useless. Dark Ruler can also be swapped for Droplet and Evenly Matched can be swapped for Lightning Storm. The Kaiju comes sometimes really in handy when you want to get rid of negates like Borreload or co. With Nibiru I am thinking of putting in third one, same goes for Called. The Side can easily change depending on the format, but this one really works out for me in this particular format.  Last but not least a few warnings and tips when playing with this Deck. <ul>  	<li>Always start with your Invoked cards before using the Dogmatika Cards, they lock you out of the Extra Deck!</li>  	<li>Do not give up to easily when seeing a big enemy board, the Deck can play through these boards really good!</li>  	<li>Beware that Punishment locks you out of your Extra Deck the next turn if you activate it in your opponents turn, so you will have to wait with summoning things like Invoked Monsters.</li>  	<li>The deck is at first glance really easy to play due to the linear combos and easy to understand cards, but it is not as easy as it seems. It is a Deck where you really have to know the format and the other Decks that await you in order to win. Because of the simple and linear cards you have, you really have to be good in every situation. The Deck is not forgiving when it comes to mistakes, every game looks different when playing this Deck. Also their are very cool interactions and cheesy plays possible with the Deck you either have to learn or have to come up with them while playing.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  If you master this Deck I guarantee you a really fun time, due to the different situations every time playing. Right now it is a really strong deck and probably Tier 1 or Tier 2. If you seek for a variation of Dogmatika without the Invoked part I recommend checking out the Dogmatika Eldlich Deck, which I also like playing and which is even stronger than the Dogmatika Invoked variation. If you want to play an Invoked Deck without Dogmatika I would recommend playing Invoked Shaddoll, which is really bad in the current format, but still really fun and capable of winning Locals or even Regionals. Another variation could be Invoked Eldlich which is really good right now, but I would say worse than this Deck and also not fun to play in my opinion or you can play Invoked Mekk-Knight, the oldest meta variation of Invoked, which is pretty okay.  When further questions occur or some more tips are needed you can ask in the comment section and I will try my best to help.  I wish you a lovely day and take care!  &nbsp;"

Hand traps can be combo pieces too!,"Dogmatika and Nekroz actually have some interesting synergies. Notable, the Nekroz monsters are summoned from the hand, not the extra deck, and the deck likes searching by sending Herald of the Arc Light. Rather than try and fit a third engine into the deck, I decided to normal summon hand traps that can go into Almiraj then Secure Gardna, to get a monster from my extra deck onto the field and in the bin. In this sense, the 12 hand traps double as our normal summon. The usual board state you end on is some Dogmatika cards, Nekroz of Unicore, and El Shaddoll Winda on your opponent's turn. Basically you lock them out of the extra deck, and then if they break that you lock them out of summoning. You also have a slew of negation options, with Fleurdelis, Clausolas, and Apkallone (in addition to hand traps and Nekroz cards which are situational hand traps).  The whole plan is normal summon a hand trap, link it into Almiraj, into Secure Gardna, summon Ecclesia, add Maximus, Summon Maximus, send Herald + Apkallone, add a ritual spell/monster, add Shaddoll Schism, discard 1. After that all you need is one Unicore/Clausolas/Brionac/Kaleidoscope and you're making Unicore and Winda.  I have no suggestions for the side deck. Since you need to run hand traps with less than 1000 ATK you can normal summon for the combo, choices for interaction are limited. I put some cards there, but probably the best call is not to side."

Kaijus clear bosses and set for the mekk-knights, Invoked for more negates power and flexibility. Mekks for overwhelming OTKs if all else fails This deck is about being smart with your plays. use your opponents cards for more summons (invoked or link) {Brain control / mind control}  Also do know i will educate you like you´ve never played invoked, or mekk-knight decks before so i will state the obvious.  <span><strong>Run down </strong></span>  i suppose there is never a specific play but its a very flexibly deck. 8 handtrap negates / 3 traps (negate´s) ,  1 handtrap, 1 monster, 4 kaiju, 2 spells (monster removal) , 1 handtrap, 1 monster, 1 spell (spell/trap removal).  and that isn´t including siding or Extra Deck both of which have more. invoked elysium is a monster wipe, Rainbow is monster spell or grave wipe, Augoedes BLS and unicorn are all 1 monster/card pop/removals.  i have the deck sided very specifically the only card id consider removing is the Nibirus for 1 mystic mine &amp; any 1 other tech card  Mystic Mine is for HEROs specifically shuts them down the best of all cards i´ve seen at worst force them to deck out. at best collect your resources lay a different feild spell and OTK  Artifact because most decks that specifically banish die to it IE: dino´s, Golden castle  Invocation, blue sky, neos fusion &amp; brain control are extras i interchange depending on opponents deck. if they use mostly Extra deck monsters or only end on Extra deck monsters take out brain control and add something else  Ghost bell &amp; ghost ogre  these cards i use less than the main deck handtraps but i still use semi often, you could change them for favored techs  nibiru i´ve recently been playing around with but the fact it nukes your feild as well doesn´t go well with this deck. its a first turn card that doesnt have much use after that lightning storm could atleast help a mekk-knights summon nibiru cant even do that  <span><strong>First turn plays</strong>   (* indicates a new thread of cards) <span>*Aleister -&gt; Almiraj -&gt; secure gardna -&gt; Mechaba (needs aleister in hand)  is the most obvious and one of the few first turn plays  *Aleister -&gt; almiraj -&gt; secure gardna.  *Mystic mine (needs aleister &amp; mystic mine in hand)  is a play against many spamming decks but doesn´t always work summoning mechaba and then mystic mining is an alternative as well but Secure gardna makes it if they attack your fine and then they have no monster effects  *Aleister -&gt; Almiraj *s/t *Mekk-knights (needs aleister &amp; any mekk-knight)  This is okay if your only trying to get bodies on the feild but not good for much else, you     can´t even use blue skys effect i only use it if i happen to have infinite impertinence in hand  *aleister-&gt; almiraj -&gt; secure gardna -&gt; mechaba -&gt;Elysium (need aleister &amp; invocation in hand) this is one of the better plays but still a very weak one  this deck sucks going 1st but as long as you survive a round without being OTKed you should have a chance to win  <strong><span>Going 2nd plays</span></strong><span>  </span>This is really were the deck shines, theres too many plays to list Especially since it doesn´t take into account your opponet´s cards but i´ll list some very basic plays  *purple nightfall -&gt; Blue sky -&gt; 1 / 2 mekk knights (need purple nightfall)      this will put bodies on the field for BLS or predaplant  verte  *aleister -&gt; Almiraj *set spell *mekk knight * Almiraj / mekk knight -&gt; predaplant (need Aleister &amp; a mekk knight)  this will get you rainbow assuming predaplant isnt negated ALWAYS SUMMON RAINBOW LAST to those of you who don´t know.     this also links up with the last play as you can summon purple for blue sky then use blue skys effect and later us blue sky to summon predaplant  Magic meltdown -&gt; aleister *Aleister -&gt; any invoked (need alister or magic meltdown) this is obvious but to those who can´t read what meltdown does is put aleister in hand  *Dinowrestler -&gt; pop *Kaiju slumber/ line up their cards *mekk-knights (Dinowrestler &lt;- optional , Need kaiju slumber &amp; mekk knight blue sky or purple knightfall) another semi obvious play but a useful one <strong><span>NOTES </span></strong> brain control / Monster reborn   ///   neither of these say you cannot use the monsters effect, go ahead and use your opponents monsters effects to aid you just make sure you dispose of the monster before the end of the turn or win if your using brain control     </span></span>"

However, since this deck can make multiple, somewhat lack luster negations and can be used as material for <strong>Mechaba</strong> blinding first seems viable.  A good starting hand for this deck would be a <strong>Souten</strong> monster (any is fine, but <strong>Koukoku of the Souten Kicks</strong> is best for the search for the trap and <strong>Yuuhi of the Souten Fists</strong> is best for fusion plays) and <strong>Souten Calling</strong>. <strong>Calling</strong> can summon up to 5 Tokens which is broken, but you can only fusion summon from the extra deck for the rest of the turn. If you have <strong>Koukoku</strong> on the field when <strong>Calling</strong> is activated you can summon 2 <strong>Gaiun of the Souten Kicks</strong> and have 1 live negate for your opponent's turn. If you have <strong>Yuuhi of the Souten Fists</strong>, you can make the <strong>Armades</strong> (<strong>Kongou</strong>) and a <strong>Gaiun</strong> with a live negate. If you have <strong>Invocation</strong> and<strong> Aleister</strong>, you can then banish an extra token on the field (yes this is legal) or a <strong>Souten</strong> in the grave to make<strong> Mechaba</strong>.  <strong>Koukoku</strong> searches your <strong>Souten</strong> Traps. <strong>Two as One</strong> is garbage but it searches <strong>Souten</strong> monsters and it is a <strong>Set Rotation</strong> target. <strong>Meltdown</strong> is your other field spell and it searches <strong>Aleister</strong>. <strong>ROTA</strong> is actually needed in this deck since there are only 2 unique maindeck <strong>Souten</strong> monsters and you kind of have to see them in order to get negates.  Your interruptions are <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>, <strong>PSY-Framegear Gamma</strong>, <strong>Souten Exorcism</strong>, <strong>Souten's Duty</strong> (it can copy <strong>Exorcism</strong>), <strong>Gaiun of the Souten Kicks</strong>, <strong>Invoked Mechaba</strong>, and <strong>Invoked Augoeides</strong>.  Going second, <strong>Phantazmay</strong> and <strong>Nibiru</strong> are the better hand traps. <strong>Impermanence</strong> can be sided in for <strong>Souten's Duty.</strong> <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> since this deck does not break boards.<strong> Kongou</strong> and <strong>Purgatrio</strong> are your damage dealers.  Since there are tokens in this deck, which are normal monsters, you could play things like <strong>First of the Dragons</strong> which is a <strong>Towers</strong>, but then you would have to play <strong>Polymerization</strong> since <strong>Invocation</strong> doesn't banish for the summon unless it's for an <strong>Invoked</strong> monster.

Your ideal hand is ""Nadir Servant"" &amp; ""Aleister the Invoker."" ""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon"" adds a bit of utility in bringing back your ""Titaniklad, the Ashen Dragon"" and provides another form of non-targeting, non-destruction removal. Always utilize the invoked plays before the dogmatika plays. Additionally, ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"" typically summons better on your second turn, by linking ""El Shaddoll Winda"" with another monster to bring out ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda.""  THEME:  What we find is a chaos Spellcaster deck, wherein the church of Dogmatika fights against the heretical Aleister and the Shaddolls, whose fusion summoning has distorted and incited the power of the void in the Abyss. Empowered beyond comprehension by this chaos, the ""Fallen of Albaz,"" an entity of the void, has transformed beyond ""Titaniklad"" into his final form, ""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon!"" The end of the world is nigh: will each side come together to summon the ultimate Spellcaster, ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon,"" or will the world cease to exist?

With the release of meow meow, the deck has gotten infinitely more consistant, with a 1 card generic combo, a plethora of 2 card combos that either end on toad and butler or set up butler with only 4 summons, or a 3 card combo that can make toad as summon number 4, effectively playing through any handtrap. This build tries to capitalize on these combos, making decent first turn boards that interrupt your opponent. That is not to dissuade anyone from trying a build with more hand traps over the spells that extend your combos, as those builds are superior in some instances.  &nbsp;  In the future, I would like to add in crossout designator, but as of the posting of this, there are no announcements on its arrival to the TCG."

Draw 2+ per turn with the Dark Magician engine combined with the Dogmatika engine, while hati","The Dark Magician engine is really really good at doing exactly 1 thing, and that's drawing cards turn after turn. The Dogmatika engine makes Winda, and hates extra decks, and even assists with the Dark Magician thing by throwing Dragon Knight into the bin. You can also make Dragoon or The Dragon Knight, or even The Dark Magicians with Eye of Timaeus, out here rocking Yugi's playbook. Restage with Souls helps gain advantage while searching Right Hand, a Spell Negate that can even get around single copies of Spell Speed 4 spells, gives the deck a little easy negation on an extender, because being real, if you somehow didn't see Souls, you're not doing a lot.  Trying Wonder Wand and Upstart Goblin in the last couple of slots. I really like how Restage feels in combination with, but any card draw helps find souls, which is basically the deck's whole game plan, and I feel light on it. On the other hand, I don't want to run Allure, because the idea is not to banish the Souls.  Cut Eye of Timaeus. The card is great, but the deck was needing more card draw. I'm up to 2 Wonder Wand. This is not the first time I've tried the card, but I was liking it at 1 copy, and I want to see if a second copy helps increase consistency by drawing me Souls after Soul Servant. That also frees up room for Accesscode and the third Winda.  I think the Foolish Burial Goods engine is really good in DM, especially since you can search Right Hand by sending Restage in addition to the Soul Servant and Metalfoes fusion.  I'm down to one Restage. I think I can improve consistency by upping the card draw, and every copy of Foolish Burial Goods can draw me Right Hand if I run 1. I'm also back on 1 Wonder Wand. At 1 in this deck it does help improve consistency a fair bit.  Clara and Rushka should be good enough for a Spellcaster Link 1 until Magistus comes to TCG. I'd probably run Magistus link 1 over Relinquished Anima, and cut Clara and Rushka for something else, maybe another Link 4 or Big Eye.  Magician Girl was just here for the Soul Servant, so I've replaced her with Palladium Oracle Mahad. This might occasionally be another extender with a relevant floating effect, but really, all it has to do to make the slot if be occasionally slightly more useful than DMG.  Turns out DMG being a 1 Tribute monster with 2300-2600 ATK points is more relevant than occasionally special summoning a level 7. Or at the very least it started coming up pretty quickly. I still want to run Eye of Timaeus, but I think I want the Restage / Right Hand more."

To get him fast, use Ojama Duo but be careful because your enemy could use the tokens to summon a Link-Monster. Use United we stand to make the emperor even stronger."

Decatron + Rekindling = 8100.","This deck is 60 cards deep because drawing infernoids in your infernoid deck is a bad thing regardless of the build  The deck plays 30+ going second cards, 19 of which are hand traps you can use on your opponents turn like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and some of which can also be used on our own turn like <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, and we add another 15 going second cards that can be used to force out negates like <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and push through an opponents board, several give you access to your bricks... I mean monsters, such as <a data-name=""Void Imagination"">Void Imagination</a>, <a data-name=""Void Vanishment"">Void Vanishment</a> to search Imagination or <a data-name=""Void Feast"">Void Feast</a> should you actually go first, <a data-name=""Void Apocalypse"">Void Apocalypse</a>, while a mediocre card it can bait an <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, or set up <a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a> as well being a Void card to be used with Feast, although it will never be searched off of V<a data-name=""oid Vanishment"">oid Vanishment</a>, although it often is a wonderful top deck milling 1 or more infernoids with its second effect.  Because drawing infernoid monsters is so bad I filled the rest of the deck with extenders that go well with <a data-name=""Infernoid Decatron"">Infernoid Decatron</a> like, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a> and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>. One normal summoned Decatron plus a reborn card is <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> into a 5300 atk <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>  plus a summonable <a data-name=""Infernoid Attondel"">Infernoid Attondel</a> for 8100 damage.  The play is normal decatron and send whatever (pop a card depending on what was sent), link into <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>, reborn decatron and send attondel, link into halqifibrax which summons veiler, then link into <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> link into Accesscode targeting Selene for 5300 atk, then summon Attondel by banishing whatever the first noid sent was and decatron for an additional 2800 atk. This combo is reliant on both players having 3 spells on the field or in the grave but you can always just place Apocalypse, Vanishment, or <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> of the field to add additional spells to the count.  Another nice play comes off of resolving Feast, you just summon a decatron to zone 2 and 4, and <a data-name=""Infernoid Sjette"">Infernoid Sjette</a> to any other zone. Next you can make 1 decatron and sjette into an <a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a> to return the other decatron to hand to be normal summoned regardless of which extra monster zone your opponent may occupy. Then you can potentially co-link Akashic with a <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, or a <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, Accesscode, or <a data-name=""Crusadia Equimax"">Crusadia Equimax and use her second effect to call whatever card you want in your deck, I usually call Rekindling as its a 3 of and there is a possible benefit of milling </a><a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a><a data-name=""Crusadia Equimax""> to use on a future turn.  The galaxy cyclone also combos with mine and feast, you can activate cyclone in grave to turn off your own mine then chain feast while your opponent cannot respond with monster effects. You can also play around mine with feast and imagiantion if your opponent has two or more monster and one was from the extra deck. You can summon </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">Infernoid Tierra, and use it to mill 2 </a><a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">and something else. You can then use N'tss to pop mine and chain feast to dodge Ash.</a>  &nbsp;"

Purgatrio is only in there to OTK your opponent. We play 1 of each Construct, Winda and Apkalone reasoning being you only need 1 of each for your 1 combo going first.

Sick of Dogmatika already? Got the Adamancipator blues? Well good news, there's a deck for you!  <strong>Why play Salamangreat in this meta?</strong>  Salamangreat can naturally run a large number of handtraps and removal, meaning it can be tailored to fight whatever is popular at the moment. While not the <em>best </em>deck, Salamangreat can be built to combat <em>many </em>decks. Salamangreat can also shut down most rogue decks with ease.  <strong>Card Choices:</strong>  2 Pot of Desires: 3 bricks too often, and there's a good number of cards in this deck that you don't want to banish.  Salamangreat Fowl: Probably the most contentious spot. This can be replaced with a Jack Jaguar, Lady Debug, or a trap; however, the extender can be useful in setting up early boards.  Gravedigger's Trap Hole/Traptrix Rafflesia: Losing to Nibiru sucks, especially if you just get OTK'd the following turn. Can also be used to stop other hand traps, like Ghost Ogre and Ash Blossom (although if you've made Rafflesia, they've probably already tried to handtrap you)  Ghost Ogre vs. Nibiru: Nibiru used to be the maindeck anti-combo tech of choice, but many decks like Adamancipator can stop Nibiru, and decks like Eldlich, Dogmatika, and Numeron simply don't care if you have Nibiru. We still run it in the side, but Ghost Ogre stops more threats among the top meta decks. It shuts down Numeron especially hard.  D. D. Crow: This can be replaced with Phantazmay or Nibiru if you don't find yourself playing against much Eldlich. However, with Invoked Dogmatika running around, shutting off your opponents from making Invoked plays can be clutch.  2 Lady Debug/2 Flame Bufferlo: You can play 3/1 Debug/Bufferlo if you want, but often times I find that having 6 searches is unnecessary, and Bufferlo can draw into traps or extenders. Also, with Parallel eXceed, you have more cyberse monsters to pitch to Bufferlo, if you find you don't need the eXceed.  3 Cosmic Cyclone: You really, really don't want to lose to Numeron. There's a lot of it these days, so doubling up on ways to out it is good. You can replace these with other hand traps if you aren't facing a lot of Numeron  2 Infinite Impermanence: You can run 3, cutting a Cyclone, Crow, Gravedigger's, or Fowl, but I find that two suffices with all the other hand traps and answers you have.  <strong>Side Deck:</strong>  3 Sphere Mode: Just another way to deal with Adamancipator and Combo Eldlich. This spot can be modified to fit your needs.  3 Dark Ruler No More: See Sphere Mode  3 Evenly Matched: See Dark Ruler No More  2 Phantazmay/1 D. D. Crow: Play whatever you want here. These slots are somewhat extraneous.  <strong>How to play: </strong>  Going first: Build a board and try to set up some backrow. Watch out for Nibiru.  Going second: Accescode Talker and OTK. Any Salamangreat monster and Parallel eXceed is a 5300 ATK Accescode + 3 pops that can attack twice. Not much can beat it.  &nbsp;"

With Rampage and Sieger you have your OTK but with an extra Infinity there isn’t much your opponent can do to stop it.  First determine how many cyber dragons you can get out on the field, if you don’t have a full set to make Sieger, Infinity and Rampage, ditch Infinity if you want to go for the OTK or play save with Infinity and Sieger with some backrow. If you can summon enough you can create Infinity easily with Galaxy soldier or with a Cyber Dragon Vier and Cyber Dragon Drei combo. When you do create him don’t forget to use Nova's effect to get back a Cyber Dragon from your grave if you managed to get one there (can be done by linking Sieger first). After you got your Infinity you can go ahead and create Rampage, since you are now able to negate any one effect, they throw at you. Create Rampage with overload fusion, or Cyberload fusion which is searchable for Cyber Dragon Core, or you can use the new Cyber Pharos card to do it. With that you can pretty much delete your opponent’s backrow and use Rampage his effect to get 3 attacks, buff him with Sieger effect in combat phase and you can attack 3x with a 4200-attack monster. That is often game if you play your cards right.  Quick side note: if you are planning on summoning Infinity do it early because this prevents an unwanted Nibiru being summoned, because then you can simply negate it.  This deck gives you the possibility to get yourself out of the toughest spots and creates its most powerful monsters in many different ways."

Offers good cycling and removal with cards like Trade-In, Desires, Lightning Storm, et","A go 2nd Gren Maju deck. Overall this deck offers a good amount of cycling and removal, allowing you to get to your key cards and clear the field for a quick OTK. It's very easy to banish 30+ cards in one turn and get a Gren Maju with 10 000+ ATK.  You don't always draw Gren Maju and there's no reliable way to search it, however it's still possible to OTK without it. Most of the time you can OTK on the 2nd turn. This deck doesn't do well against boards with lots of negates or monsters immuned to targeting/destruction, so I'd say it's just a casual deck for fun.  Core of the deck : Gren Maju and Pot of Desires. Don't play these at less than 3.   Hand traps are here to slow your opponent going first, feel free to swap them for other hand traps if you don't like these ones.  Lvl 8 Danger cards combined with Trade-In allow for deck cycling and removal. Bigfoot needs to be at 3 but you can play Thunderbird at 2.  Eater of Millions and Orochi help to banish cards and give access to more removal. Always play them at 3.  Castle of Stromberg offers banishing although slower than the other cards and gives easy access to Hexe Trude for extra removal. Hexe Trude is also a target for Trade-In. You can change the ratios for Glife and Hexe Trude if you want.  A single Kaiju, because it's always good removal and it's a target for Trade-In. Feel free to swap it for something else.  Lightning Storm is an excellent go 2nd card, allowing you to clear the board or backrow if you're playing against a backrow heavy deck. Just be careful not to use Orochi on your opponent's turn or you won't be able to use Lightning Storm. Raigeki is an ""extra copy"" of Lightning Storm.  Extra Deck is filled with Rank 8s as it's easy to go into them. You don't really use it going 2nd since you'll most likely banish it, but going first you can easily put Hope Harbinger or Seven Sins on board for negation or protection. I didn't put much thoughts into it since it's entirely banished most of the time, so you could tinker with it to see what works best.  I don't play Extravagence or Duality because their restrictions restrain the Deck too much. You could play Allure but it's kinda bricky.  I don't play Dark Ruler No More &amp; Evenly Matched because this deck needs the Battle Phase. You could try a Kaiju engine with Interrupted Slumber for more field removal if you are not satisfied with Raigeki + Lightning Storm. Necroface is also an option offering great recycling."

This is a highly experimental deck, but it makes Halqifibrax surprisingly consistently.  Let's talk about the card choices.  <span><strong>MONSTERS</strong></span>  1x Infernity Archfiend - The iconic Infernity card. Unfortunately at 1, and with Lavalval Chain being banned, this card is surprisingly hard to special summon. However, when you do, you get a search, provided you have no cards in hand.  3x Infernity Wildcat - Part of the new support from Phantom Rage! You can discard an Infernity to special this card from the hand, which allows you to both get a tuner on the field without using your normal and empty your hand. You really want to see this in your opening.  3x Infernity Conjuror - Also part of the new support, can special summon itself from the grave with an empty hand. Mostly used as a non-tuner body.  3x Infernity Necromancer - Allows you to special an Infernity from the grave with an empty hand. This can be used to trigger Archfiend, or grab a tuner from the grave for your main combo.  2x Infernity Mirage - Can tribute itself to special summon 2 Infernity monsters from the grave with an empty hand. Great for either starting your combo, or grabbing more resources in the mid-late game.  1x Armageddon Knight - We have so many monsters we want to dump into the grave, so this card is pretty self explanitory.  5x Danger Monsters - The Danger engine is really useful in this deck. The discard effect helps in emptying the hand, and maybe grabbing some extra cards along the way. Worst case scenario, all of them are dark, making them Allure targets.  1x O-lion, 1x Deskbot 001 - Combo pieces. Deskbot isn't the worst thing to draw, since Halq can summon from the hand, but drawing O-lion means you're going to be playing a slow game.  <span><strong>SPELL/TRAP</strong></span>  3x Infernity Paranoia - More new support! Allows you to tribute a dark to special an Infernity of the same level from your deck. Also allows you to add back Infernity monsters from the grave on later turns. Amazing with Conjuror or Wildcat in hand, both giving a Halq summon. Since the tributed monster doesn't have to be an Infernity, you can also tribute a Danger monster for either another level 3 or to set up an Archfiend for later.  3x Allure of Darkness - Draw power. Also allows you to empty your hand.  1x One for One - Gives you either Mirage for summons, or a Deskbot for an emergency tuner.  3x Transmodify - Probably the most controversial card in the deck in my opinion, especially since we really only run 1 target for it. The Archfiend summon is SUPER important, however, and I feel like this adds a little bit of consistency to your searches.  1x Foolish Burial, Monster Reborn, Infernity Launcher - We like the grave  One thing to point out about the spell lineup is we don't play any quick plays, meaning all of these can be set before you use them to empty your hand. Remember this, it comes up often!  3x Infernity Suppression - With an empty hand, this stops monster effects! Can be used aggressively on your opponents turn to stop effects, or more commonly, to stop hand traps on your own turn. As good as it is, it only works with an Infernity on the field, which can make it dead sometimes.  3x Infernity Barrier - Stops everything but summons. Same as above, but the negation is incredibly good, it feels wrong not to run this at 3.  1x Infernity Break - Not great removal, but removal nonetheless.  <span><strong>EXTRA</strong></span>  1x Halqifibrax, 1x Linkross, 1x Metal Marcher, 1x Barricadeborg Blocker, 1x Auroradon, 1x Herald, 1x Borreload Savage - Combo Pieces. I'll link the main combo below!  1x Omega - For the rare times we can make an 8 and can't use Borreload Savage  1x Goyo, 1x Coral Dragon, 1x Infernity Hell Archfiend, 1x Desert Locusts - Level 6 Synchros are braindead to make in this deck, with both Coral Dragon and Desert Locusts being Halq targets on your opponents turn.  1x Accesscode, 1x Knightmare Unicore, 1x Knightmare Phoenix - General links, to be honest I don't go into these often but they're there if you need them.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>MAIN COMBO</strong></span>  In case you don't know the main Halq combo, this is what I do.  Link into Halqifibrax &gt; Special Deskbot &gt; Link into Linkross &gt; Synchro for Metal Marcher &gt; Special Deskbot &gt; Deskbot and Linkross into Barricadeborg &gt; Link into Auroradon &gt; Special Deskbot from grave &gt; Auroradon special O-lion from deck &gt; Synchro into Borrelsavage &gt; Synchro into Arc Light  &nbsp;  Like I said, this deck is super experimental, but hopefully you enjoy it as much as I have!"

You can think of this deck as <strong>Salamangreat Gazelle</strong> the deck since each card in the archetype Special Summons itself in someway. You really want your starting hand to have a lot of extenders so you can go into your synchro and xyz plays. If you want to do link plays, you have to do it before using any of the<strong> Gazelle</strong> effects.  The starters you want to see are <strong>Datascape Rabbit - Tutu</strong> and any way to get <strong>Datascape Gate - Qinglong</strong> into the grave other than <strong>Datascape Servant - Laolao</strong>. <strong>Rabbit</strong> is your normal summon and an extender from grave. <strong>Laolao</strong> summons a <strong>Datascape</strong> from grave so you don't want to summon it at this point since you won't have any in the grave. <strong>Qinglong</strong> banishes itself to search a <strong>Datascape</strong> monster and you should really search <strong>Laolao</strong> at this point so you can special summon the <strong>Datascape</strong> that you discarded from <strong>Qinglong</strong>. From there, your first priority should be making interruptions on your opponent's turn like <strong>Number 3: Cicada King</strong> or <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys.</strong> The last interruption you want to make is<strong> Datascape Fox - Xianxian</strong> since its <strong>Herald</strong> eff is for your cards too. If you know that your opponent runs <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> you can make <strong>Naturia Barkion</strong> with things like<strong> Psychic Wheeleder</strong>, <strong>Psychic Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Gallis the Star Beast</strong> (these also can act as your extenders).  Every card in this deck is an extender (YEP CRACKED). <strong>Desires</strong> since we NEED to see those extenders.  Interruptions you can make for your opponent's turn are<strong> Datascape Fox - Xianxian, Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, Naturia Barkion, Adamancipator Risen Raptite, Hyper Psychic Riser</strong> (in dire situations or you bricked), <strong>Desert Locusts</strong> (if you made <strong>Halqifibrax</strong>), <strong>VFD, Number 3: Cicada King, Datascape Phoenix - Fengfeng</strong> (for recovery), and <strong>Datascape Shell - Jiajia. Datascape Gate - Zhuque</strong> is also a negation.  Since we are going first, we are trying to make as many interruptions as possible and since every card in this deck can be <strong>Ashed</strong> we are playing<strong> Called by the Grave</strong>. Also of course we are playing <strong>Barkion</strong> for <strong>Impermanence</strong>.  Going second, we can side in things like<strong> Ghost Ogre, Nibiru, Tactics Talent, Dark Ruler No More, </strong>and<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>. Going second, <strong>Hyper Psychic Riser</strong> is like <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> on legs, but don't use it for that since it affects you too. You can also go into the<strong> Aussa</strong> link to get value off your opponent's grave. I don't advise playing the <strong>Wynn</strong> link since there are very few decks that will probably use wind monsters.  The most cracked card in this deck is <strong>Datascape Capital - Jiulong</strong> since it can summon 4 Extra Deck<strong> Datascapes</strong>, but you need to control 4 <strong>Datascape Gate</strong> cards. Unless we see more support for this deck by which I mean more<strong> Gate</strong> cards, I don't see people trying to resolve this effect."

Seeing how things would work. Depending on the deck you face is why I have the side deck like it is. Without those cards that help negate or stop searches, your chances of winning are a bit harder. From testing the deck out, I did notice that going just pure DM didn't work as you do need cards like ash blossom and whatnot.  &nbsp;  Basically you want to get as with any DM deck, DMC, Eternal Soul on board and to protect them from destruction. Getting Dragoon helps with negating and to destroy cards. Magicians' Combination for an extra negate, Destined Rivals to stop monster effects. Having Solemn helps with stopping monster summons or a magic/spell effect. Magician Navigation is more used as to get to the grave for an extra negation. Rarely used to actually summon Dark Magician. Nibiru helps with stopping field swarms and such.  Any tips would be very appreciated as I do know the deck can still be improved and whatnot."

(Also, Tsuyu Asui is best girl, and My Hero Academia is best anime!)","This is a Paleozoic Frog deck that uses the Trap Card, Warning Point. Warning Point triggers when a monster is Summoned, and prevents that monster from attacking or being used as material for a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link Summon, and also negates that monster's effects for the turn. I mainly got the idea to use this in Frogs because that deck is chockful of Normal Traps. Not to mention that it can be searched out by Lilith, Lady of Lament and Trap Trick.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""Kero!"", the Japanese onomatopoeia for a frog croaking. In My Hero Academia--or ""Boku No Hero Academia"" for you filthy weebs--Tsuyu Asui has a habit of saying ""Kero."" In the English dub, that sound is replaced with her saying ""Ribbit!""  &nbsp;  This deck functions just like a normal Paleo Frog would, so you absolutely NEED to go first! The Side Deck also contains some floodgates, Anti-Spell Fragrance, and Solemn Judgment, just in case your opponent is playing this deck's worst nightmare: Lightning Storm.

Waiting for the new ""Raiders"" and phantom knights support (ocg now), I realized this build. Very fast and versatile with many skilled combos. The Main one is this by having a Simoon, another blackwing and Blizzard the far north/ or black whirlwind in order to take one more blackwing when you normal.  1. Attivate Simoon's effect. Place whirlwind and add Auster. Normal summon Auster and call back the banished monster by Simoon's effect and add Harmattan for whirlwind's effect (if you preaviously had a whirlwind in the hand, take Blizzard too).  2. Special summon Harmattan without activating its effect on the field and Synchro summon Nothung in the Extra zone. Normal summon Blizzard for Nothung's effect, special summon Harmattan from the GY and add Oroshi the squall from your deck because of black whirlwind. Now attivate Harmattan's effect targeting Blizzard to make it become lv4, special summon oroshi from your hand.  Now you should have:  Simoon, Nothung in the extra zone, Blizzard the far north, the blackwing special summoned by Auster and Oroshi for the monsters and At least 1 Black Whirlwind in the spell/trap card zone.  3. Now, use Nothung and Oroshi to summon Blackwing Tamer Hawk Joe on the field (Absolutely not in the extra monster zone), the use its effect to call Nothung back and then, use Nothung and the blackwing preaviously special summoned by Auster to link summon Raidraptor-Wise strix. Use wise strix's effect to special summon Zephyros from the deck. Then, xyz summon Raidraptor- Force strix by using Zephyros and the lv4 Harmattan as material.  4. Use force strix's effect to add Raiders' Wing to your hand.  Special summon it by detaching Zephyros from Force strix and then, call back Zephiros by returning black whirlwind to your hand (avoiding so the Simoon effect in the end phase). Then, use Zephyros and Raider's wing to special summon another force strix and its effect by detaching Raiders wing to add another lv 4 winged beast monster from you deck (generally Bora or Kris). Then, wise strix's second effect activates and set from you deck to your field the Rank up magic- phantom knight's force.  At this point you should have on the field:  Simoon, Blizzard, Wise strix (in the EMZ), 2 Force strix (one of them without xyz materials) and the set Rank up magic quick spell (you won't activate it this turn).  5. Use Wise Strix and the force strix without materials to link summon Verte Anaconda in the Extra monster zone. Then, use Blizzard and Simoon to synchro summon Borrel Savage Dragon targeting wise strix in the GY to equip him.  6. Finally, use Verte anaconda's effect to send the Red Eyes Fusion spell from you deck to the GY (as Wells as Dark magician and Red eyes Black dragon) ti special summon Dragun of Red Eyes.  7. In the opponent's draw phase, use the set rank up magic on your force strix, remote 6 dark monster from the GY and overlap xyz summon Raidraptor- Ultimate Falcon.  &nbsp;  And this was the dark combos starting by Simoon. Eventuali, you can also start different the and set up the rank up soul shave force instead of the quick one to use it on you turn to special summon Cyber dragon infinity. Then, after you summon red eyes dragun, use the first effect of Cyber Dragon infinity to absorb the verte anaconda (considering that you should have At this point, 1800 Lp because of both the effect of soul shave force plus verte anaconda which can't be' used first the rank up It you want summon Infinity too).  I just considered the Basic combo. In reality, you could have much more than this.  Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

I also noticed that galaxy photon was pretty useless without afterglow dragon. This deck does not have galaxy eyes afterglow because it is not released in the TCG sadly. I started to put in a lot of other engines together into this deck and had to watch a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh Videos and combos and I got this deck. Some people might ask how to play this deck and how it is even close to a combo/meta deck.  <span><strong>Dogmatika</strong></span>  The reason why I played Dogmatika was because it was just a light engine that stopped everything. And it was a light engine. That's useful to Galaxy Soldier that was almost the only reason why I decided to play it. I unfortunately won't be playing the invoked engine along with it. I'm pretty sure everyone knows how to play dogmatika. If you don't then you should watch this video:<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpbKTbbCs8E</a>  <span><strong>Chaos Galaxy</strong></span>  I can't explain it better than this video. If you don't want to play my weird version of the deck play this deck, it's actually meta worthy. Most of the deck is based around it: https://youtu.be/vID5pVkcz-o  &nbsp;  I think the side deck is self explanatory. The extra deck is covered in both of the videos. Have A Nice Day"

Generaider starters: Loptr, Boss Quest, Terraforming.  Your main strategy is to do your Jet synchro stuff + add the Generaider package to get an extra negate &amp; OTK potential. You can make this better by playing Linkross but lets be honest, being a Chad is more fun.  https://youtu.be/51BeW_cTl48  "

With Negalogia, this deck is able to wipe every board through D/D/D Stone ","Alich, Calcab, and Farfa all have built-in interaction, so going 2nd we'll be able to trigger them by giving up their special summon effect because we run many lv3 fiend extender anyway since Darius needs fiend lv3. From there, Darius effect is super handy as it cant be destroyed by battle and it destroys opponent's monster. Main phase 2 we can rank it up to Negalogia to wipe the board.  Alich/Calcab/Farfa ratio depends on your matchup as they all do different things (Alich is the best in my testing because it negates monster effect and we can clean it with Negalogia). Against meta, its impossible to go Negalogia freely, so we run big staples to combat/make way for Negalogia to wipe board. Also if forced going first, we will heavily dependent on side deck (you can use floodgate or negation backrow).  Pros: Fun take on BA archetype, bunch of removal cards, and strong staples.  Cons: Bad going first, Eldlich/other GY deck will benefit from Negalogia."

Than ritual S  Nekroz of Brionac tributing Shaddoll Appkallone to search for Shaddol Ruq , which you can use next turn to summon Shaddol Winda with Appkallone and Linkuriboh.

The goal of this deck is to power up Firewall Dragon Darkfluid haveing a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Ritual in your gy.  Though expensive, Extra-Foolish Burial can speed this up for the Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz. Foolish burial can be used likewise with ritual. Do note that extra deck monsters who were not summoned properly can not be summoned from the gy.  Your get some Special Summon monsters in the gy by link summoning with them.  Parallel eXceed, Cyberse Clock Dragon, and Cyberse Quantum Dragon can be individually used as material to summon Cyberse Magician. Magician and Cynet Ritual can be searched by Cyberse Witch.  Cyberse Integrator can be used as material for Cyberse Reminder. By detaching integrator you can add Cynet Fusion to your hand to fuse Reminder and Cyberse Synchron (special summoned by Integrator) to summon Diplexer Chimera. Chimera can then tribuw itsself to set up another fusion. Thats 2 monsters in the gy. It does require Armored Bitron/2 Clock Tokens (You can also use 1 Clock Token leveled up Cyberse Synchron), Cyberse Synchron, and a level 3 to execute. Any of these (Excluding Tokens) can be searched using Cynet Mining (can be searched by Clock Dragon), Cyberse Magician, or Armored Bitron (can't summon itself). Backup Supervisor can search for Backup Secretary as the level 3.  Be careful when using Cynet Ritual and try not to banish your key Special Summon monsters from the gy.  Clock Lizard and Clock Spartoi can assin in Fusion Summoning. Cynet Mining , Cyberse Magician, and Armored Bitron can search for Clock Wyvern if you're looking to summon Cyberse Clock Dragon.  Darkfluid's maximum natural atk is 13000. With only 2/4 it can have 8000, enough for an OTK!"

Ideally you want to go first as this deck struggles pretty hard to break established boards, so your side deck should generally focus more on solving this problem if the many hand traps prove insufficient. You can get to a Butler off of any Prank-Kid, by doing as follows:  - Normal summon any Prank-kid, link into Meow-Meow (which summons a different Prank-Kid from the hand/deck) - Link the Meow-Meow and that Prank-Kid into Bow-Wow-Bark (which summons a different kid) - Link the Bow-Wow-Bark and that Prank-Kid into Dodo-Doodle-Doo, using its effect to search out Prank-Kids Pandemonium (and summoning a different Prank-kid from the deck <strong>which <span>MUST</span> be either Fansies, Dropsies or Lampsies</strong>) -Activate Dodo-Doodle-Doo, adding back the other two materials for Battle Butler from your GY to your hand -At this point, with some combination of Fansies, Dropsies and Lampsies in your hand/on your field, activate Pandemonium to fuse all 3 into Battle Butler (which locks you into Prank-Kids for the rest of the turn, so you'll want to either summon your Eldlich the Golden Lord using his own effect first, or wait until your opponent's turn to summon him using Eldlixer of Scarlet Sanguine/White Destiny) *Side note: when you mill a card for Fansies' effect, just send a copy of Prank-Kids Place since you won't be needing it at that point. Furthermore, make sure to not banish any Prank-Kids from your hand for Rocksies' effect as you need all 3 other Prank-Kids in play to make the Battle Butler.  Technically you can do this combo without Rocksies (instead just going Kid -&gt; Meow-Meow + Kid -&gt; Dodo + Kid -&gt; Dodo effect to add back kids -&gt; Pandemonium for Butler), but using Rocksies allows you to fix a dead handtrap in your hand (like Nibiru) and sets up an additional attribute in the GY for Accesscode Talker later.  Otherwise, this deck works just like your typical Eldlich affair, with Crystron Halqifibrax + Selene to get an easy Accesscode Talker turn 3/4 using Effect Veiler. The Extra Deck is extremely flexible beyond the Halq/Selene/Accesscode package and the Prank-Kids cards, so really you can run whatever you want (I opted here for several links to link away already-used Conquistadors and Huaqueros, but really you could run whatever you want). Furthermore, the Side Deck should obviously be tailored to fit your own personal preferences/needs.  Is this particular combination of decks any better than the countless other Eldlich mashups (Invoked, Dogmatika, etc.)? Probably not, as Prank-Kids are notoriously fragile and are countered by just about every hand trap currently played. That being said, the double Battle Butler wipe is certainly funny to pull off and can set you up for an easy grind/OTK later as your opponent struggles to get enough field presence to power through your Eldlich cards."

The ""Battleguards"" are not close to being a popular or even known deck type, but I tried to make something out of it to the best of my ability.</p> <p>Obviously, the deck needs three copies of both ""<a data-name=""Swamp Battleguard"">Swamp Battleguard</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Lava Battleguard"">Lava Battleguard</a>"", since they are what gives the deck its name. On their own, they are rather uninteresting and even in pairs they only boost their stats by a small margin, but with ""<a data-name=""Feast of the Wild LV5"">Feast of the Wild LV5</a>"", we can Special summon the duo for further Xyz and Link summons, or to go into their ""boss monster"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Battleguard King"">Battleguard King</a>"".</p> <p>The ""Star"" series of cards provides some further summoning material, with ""<a data-name=""Tenma the Sky Star"">Tenma the Sky Star</a>"" being Normal summonable without tribute while you control an Earth monster (a requirement that the ""Battleguards"" can provide), while ""<a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>"" can enter the field via Normal Summon when a Light monster is present. They also bring their friends with the other Attribute with them when summoned, allowing for some swarming and the summon of ""<a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a>"", who then can summon the Fusion monster ""<a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>"" for a surprisingly helpful beater with an in-built search effect.</p> <p>To make summoning some Level 5 monsters a little easier, I included both ""<a data-name=""Overlay Booster"">Overlay Booster</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Super Quantum Red Layer"">Super Quantum Red Layer</a>"" into the mix, both sporting a Special summon effect and being overall useful for the strategy.</p> <p>In the backrow you will find ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for easy revival, ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" as a ghetto OTK option, ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" for board clear, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" for draw power (we play enough copies of everything, so the banish effect is pretty much irrelevant), ""<a data-name=""The Monarchs Stormforth"">The Monarchs Stormforth</a>"" as both removal and tribute summon option if needed and ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" to gain access to either ""<a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>"" if you need an added effect on a Level 5 Warrior monster or ""<a data-name=""Giltia the D. Knight"">Giltia the D. Knight</a>"" if you could start a summon chain with ""<a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>"".</p> <p>The Traps consist of ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"", which stops the opposing effect monsters while lowering their ATK to beatable levels, ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" as a better version of ""<a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a>"" in this deck since any damage you can inflict helps in the long run, ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" to steal the opposing defenses, ""<a data-name=""Battleguard Howling"">Battleguard Howling</a>"" for further damage and board control and a ""<a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" in case you need to revive another monster.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is mainly Rank 5 Xyz monsters with useful effects, some Links to have certain options available, the ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" targets as well as ""<a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a>"" for the ""<a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a>"" summon.</p> <p>The deck is nowhere near consistent. In fact, it is very bricky and can have some serious issues in certain situations, but that is exactly why I listed it as a Casual deck. If you want the challenge of working with ""Battleguards"" though, this deck can be the way to go.

Ok.  The deck has many ways to get <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a>, but only one <a data-name=""Numeron Calling"">Numeron Calling</a>. This is because I've never had a duel where I could have one if I had another, it was either doomed from the get-go or win more. Add more if you feel you need them, the Extra deck is already cluttered as is.  Go for the likely to be banned ZEXAL or if the opponent will counter this, <a data-name=""Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a> or Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, I prefer it over Avramax, but he's in the extra deck if you need to swap.  If you don't get Numeron Network early on, aim for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> as they can control games by themselves.  Eldlich, Dogmatika, and Invoked easily cycle themselves as long as you draw their recycler card (For Eldlich, just send a trap to the graveyard) Shaddoll are kind of the weak link sadly, as there's only so much space.

Summon a Crusadia monster. Use it to link summon Magius. Special summon another Crusadia monster to Magius' zone by it's own effect. Activate Magius' effect to add another Crusadia to your hand. Link summon a LINK-2 monster. Summon the new Crusadia monster by it's own effect. You may now active activate additional effects if you chose Spatha or Regulex. Link summon again for either Equimax or Topologic Trisbeana. If you find yourself too vulnerable with only Equimax. Consider using I:P Masquerna as it's material to protect it from effects, or use Regulex to get Crusadia Power to protect it. You can also get Crusadia Revival to boost it's ATK, make it less vulnerable in battle. If you think you can win a battle, you can use Crusadia Testament instead to draw cards and hopefully get a Crusadia monster to boost Equimax's ATK.  Kaiju Monsters can be used to take advantage of Equmax's or Regulex's Up-pointing arrow.  If you're looking for a more defensive play, Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax is a great candidate. Your opponent can only attack it, and it gains ATK equal to that of a special summoned monster it's battling. Not to mention that fact that your opponent can't can't target it with card effect, making this much more difficult.  &nbsp;  Seriously though these new backgrounds are awesome!"

Finding a natural home alongside the Invoked engine, Invoked Dogmatika has quickly become a competitor in todays meta. However, there is some uncertainty surrounding this deck. While though the deck's potential is high, its consistency tends to be an issue in long tournament settings, and has a tendency to produce awkward hands and scenarios, that can leave it outpaced in a world filled with, ""Halqross,"" combo decks. That being said, in the hands of an experienced player, Invoked Dogmatika is, without a doubt, one of the best decks in the current meta. I would rate it as a Tier 2 deck."

The plan with this Deck is very simple, as always: Get your Field Spell up and prevent the Opponent from doing anything about it.  Some of the ""one of"" cards in this deck might seem off, but both Wave and Power are searchable and in this particular match-up not the cards you really need, but still have their value. Powers effects are both situationally useful, getting a copy of an Equip Spell back is huge and lowering Attack/Defense can sometimes be make or break in this particular match-up. Usually you want more than 1 Power in the Deck, but Blue Eyes sadly doesnt really too heavily on Effect Monsters so ultimately its best at 1. Wave on the other Hand is usually not good enough to be ran, but since Phantasm Spiral likes long Duels more than most other Decks this card can help you get there by summoning a Dragon of your own no matter what while discarding one of your opponents Hand cards.  I'm personally running Beast-Warrios over Megalo here, only because the 100 extra Attack from Tenki is useful vs Blue Eyes and because Blue Eyes banishes our Field Spell so Sea Stealth Attack isnt as good sadly :(  &nbsp;  Enough of that. A few words to every card in this Deck (including Extra Deck, which are cards that are good in general for this Deck)  <strong>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</strong>: Our ""Boss"" Monster, biggest Hitter, we can summon them from Deck/GY/Hand with the equip Spells, never run 3, maybe run 2, most of the time 1 will be enough. A lot of decks don't run him, I like him though.  <strong>Gene-Warped Warwolf</strong>: 4 Star Normal with 2000 ATK, thats all we want. Beast-Warrior so he works with Tenki  <strong>Dragoons of Draconia</strong>: 4 Star Normal. Very rarely useful for its Pendulum Spell Effect, mostly there to not run out of Steam, also Beast-Warrior for Tenki  <strong>Ash-Blossom</strong>: Probably the best Handtrap  <strong>Fire Formation - Tenki</strong>: Searches a Beast-Warrior and gives 100 ATK. be careful as it can eat up precious Spell/Trap Slots.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Crash</strong>:</em> Probably the best equip Spell, works when attacking them Directly and can potentially neutralize threats by shifting them to Defense Position.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Grip</strong>:</em> Gives 500 ATK, really useful to make our Boss Monster actually be able to kill other Boss Monsters head on.  <strong>Phantasm Spiral Wave</strong>: Highly Situational, thats why only 1 copy. Summons Dragon after Battle Phase sadly, but atleast discards 1 card from opponents Hand.  <em><strong>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</strong></em>: The best card in the Deck. The entire reason we're playing this. Get this out, if you can protect it you're probably winning.  <strong>Card of Demise</strong>: Really Powerful in the right situations, useless in the wrong ones. Not a must have card, but definitely a strong one.  <strong>Dark Hole</strong>: Board Clears are good for us, we like slow Games because we can get value out of Pacifis. Can destroy our Token in our turn to make room for a new one to trigger Pacifis in their Turn again.  <em><strong>Heat Wave</strong></em>: Best card for going first aside from the Field Spell. Stops most Decks from doing anything at all, doesnt annoy us in the slightest.  <strong>Raigeki</strong>: Better Dark Hole aside from clearing our own Token, just an overall good card, if you have it toss it in.  <em><strong>Terraforming</strong></em>: Sadly we can't have 3 anymore and that hurt the Deck plenty, always a must have card.  <strong><em>Skill Drain:</em></strong> Probably the single strongest card in here aside from Pacifis. If your opponent has no out vs this card they might lose the game on the spot. That's how strong it is.  <strong>Champion's Vigilance:</strong> Deny all when you have the Token or Dragon. 3 feels clunky, 1 feels like not running it at all. Experiment yourself, it's always a good card.  <strong>Solemn Warning:</strong> Just helps with our Gameplan  <em><strong>Metaverse:</strong></em> We have to run this  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Battle:</strong></em> This is the reason why Pacifis is as strong as it is. Searchable  destroy anything that you can play from Hand when Pacifis is on the Board, never run less than 3.  <em><strong>Phantasm Spiral Power:</strong></em> Negates Effects, match-up dependent but usually incredibly strong, since it can retrieve Equip Spells from GY you should always run at least 1.  <strong>Quaking Mirror Force:</strong> Most Mirror Forces are good, this one felt the best vs Blue Eyes. Experiment yourself but they're basically just Stun Cards that buy another Turn and potentially set-up your next Turn.  &nbsp;  <strong>Megalosmasher X:</strong> another 4 Star Normal 2000ATK card. We like these, this one is a little special, I'll explain in a bit.  <strong>Mystic Mine:</strong> If you can afford its a good card for going 2nd.  <strong>Advance Draw:</strong> Just a card to think about if you're really budget.  <strong>Fossil Dig:</strong> Only with Megalosmasher X, searches it.  <strong>Painful Decision:</strong> I'd only run if you run 2 sets of 3 copies of Normal Monsters  <em><strong>Pot of Extravagance:</strong></em> If you can afford it, use it.  <strong>Unexpected Dai:</strong> A lot of the time basically a Monster card, can sometimes help set-up Extra Deck (yes, you heard correctly)  <strong>Lose 1 Turn:</strong> Really strong stun card, if you can fit it you should probably run it.  <em><strong>Sea Stealth Attack:</strong></em> This card almost needs to be in the deck. It can retrieve Pacifis from the GY, protect our Spells/Traps (think Skill Drain) and turns Megalo and our Token into destroyer machines. Sadly doesnt help when Pacifis is banished :(  <em><strong>There can only be one:</strong> </em>Powerful card but be careful with it because both the Token and our Dragon are Wyrm-Type  <em><strong>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi:</strong></em> Just a really strong card, experiment with it yourself.  <strong>Evenly Matched:</strong> If you can afford it, its good for 2nd.  <strong>Storming Mirror Force:</strong> Another good Mirror Force  Extra Deck:  You don't really need one, but there are situations where you're gonna wish that you did indeed get these  <em><strong>Utopia/Utopia the Lightning:</strong></em> You need Utopia for Lightning. Lightning gets rid of basically any Boss Monster, its insane. You might not need it vs every Deck, but sometimes it's your only out.  <em><strong>Bagooska:</strong></em> If your opponent can't deal with it ( a lot can't ) it buys precious Time for our Deck, really good, but rare to summon.  <strong>Gem-Knight Pearl:</strong> I'll be honest, in over 100 Duels vs Blue Eyes I've summoned this card once, and it almost would have won me the game. Never ever even thought about summoning it vs any other Deck, it might come in handy though. It's cheap so get it if you can, it might save your game one day.  &nbsp;  There are a lot more potential cards such as the Paleozoic cards and a few more Extra Deck options, but I personally only found these to be relevant.  That's a lot to digest but I hope this gave some overview over the Deck and that it helps you find your own Deck List of Phantasm Spiral. Due to the nature of having the core just be the Field Spell + Cards to search + probably some Normal Monsters the Deck has a decent amount of flexibility. I sincerely hope you have fun with it, your opponents won't :D"

In some ways it is extremely boring - the main goal is Needlefibre into True King of All Calamities. However, it's also a little bold, in that I've shaken up the True King dino formula a little bit to try and increase consistency, at the cost of interactivity. This is a real cost, and it does lead to the usual problems with super heavy combo decks, especially in a combo format. So, why are you playing Dinos as a going first deck instead of Adamancipator?  One reason is flexibility. Your deck is intrinsically good going second and has easy OTKs (as well as a Borrelsword combo just in case), and the ability to break boards. You also have easy recovery plays in Double Evolution Pill, and while your combos are smaller, that leaves room for more follow-up plays. You won't extend as far as rocks, and you don't get the advantage of Koa'Ki Meiru Guardian, but rocks can also generally be stopped on the Needlefibre, whereas your opponent might not always be able to stop you from using Dinosaur effects at all with Miscellaneousaurus, and that makes it hard to stop Calamities and the Pill at the same time.  I tried to build it with this in mind, so that while you blind going first you're prepared to win going second.  The numbers on Dinosaurs are pretty standard, but there are some meaningful inclusions and exclusions. Lost World is cut - the deck needs a face-lift and Lost World, while an easy consistency boost, doesn't make a whole lot of sense going first. A meaningful inclusion is Carboneddon and Guarddragon Justicia. This can make Coral Dragon of off 6 1 card starters, but more importantly, is also the whole Calamities combo. You don't really care if you see the bricks, since you like having tuners anyways, and Carboneddon is still a Dinosaur monster you can use to activate effects, then get some free value off of.  The extra deck is just layers of combos. The most important is making True King of All Calamities off of Needlefibre, but the extra deck can also make Borrelsword Dragon off of Needlefibre (with the small downside of running Jet Synchron over Deskbot 001, which in turn gives the deck an extra 1 card starter). Since sometimes you have a couple of extra monsters on the field and can't do the combo, we have I:P, with Unicorn and Apollousa being the most notable targets.  Almiraj and Secure Gardna seem weird, but they make Baby dinos with Pill into UTC, and give him fodder. It's just more ways to start plays, so that most combinations of cards will get you onto the field.  I wanted more room for hand traps, but even without Lost World, the Diagram ""engine"" is still really good in the deck. It doesn't hurt to leave Ravenous Croc or Vermillion Mech on the field when you make Calamities, especially with I:P around, and you just need more ways to pop cards. Gamma seems essential - I need high impact hand traps that are flexible and generic. There's just a lot of stuff only Gamma will answer, and Gamma is generally a better option than other hand traps going second. I don't really care about having bricks in the hand going second, I need the highest impact hardest to interrupt stuff possible. Imperm makes the cut on the other 3 spaces. You could run 7 hand traps, and I think statistically that would be a more correct ratio, but I feel like it's worth seeing hand traps less often to hand them be high impact.  Back on Ash, making space for Deskbot 001. This makes Borrelsword a reliable follow-up and makes Jet Synchron a better starter.  Made space for Gamma. Unsure on the True King Engine, in practice it gives another way to pop cards and opens up value, but it's not strictly necessary most of the time, and you don't see those cards most games. On the other hand, sniping extra decks is cool... But is it as cool as Hand Traps? I think I'll start testing a version without the True King Engine...  Cut Jet Synchron, back to 2 UTC. This freed up space for Carboneddon. Having a back-up way to start combos and a free dino extender is actually pretty useful, you get a lot of value off of Carboneddon. I could just run Jurrac Aeolo #2 and save deck space, but Carboneddon gives me an extra extender, and replaces Jet Synchron as another 1 card Calamities.  Trying a more budget-friendly split of One For One, 1 Animadorned Archosaur, and 1 Jet Synchron. This gives the deck 2 more 1.5 card starters, puts back in the Borrelsword follow-up, saves money, and gives us ways to pitch Carboneddon alongside other fringe benefits (like One For One being a Special Summon, and Archosaur actually being better when special summoned usually.)"

This is a 3 cards combo but we're running 7 Instant Fusion + 13 ","Oh boy I never expected Syrus Truesdale deck can be taken seriously. This deck is so consistent to spit out Mobile Base protected with Connection Zone. As long as you have the 3 cards mentioned, <strong>Instant Fusion + 1 roid + fusion spell</strong>, you're good to go. Combo: <a>https://bit.ly/2E8HmUX</a>. I'll explain card by card and their role in deck.  The roid (Speedroid): Double Yoyo (for Halq/Accesscode OTK), Terrortop (best roid, free/searcher), 2 Den-Den Daiko Duke (extender for Halq OTK), Taketomborg (extender), 3 Tri-Eyed Dice (best fusion fodder, negates atk from GY).  3 Keeper of Dragon Magic: Instant Fusion/other fusion spell searcher while being Megaroid City fodder.  Predap package: 1 Ophrys Scorpio (Instant Fusion/other fusion spell searcher while being Megaroid City fodder), 2 Lonefire, 2 Darlingtonia Cobra (2 just in case its drawn).  Fusion spell: Instant Fusion (summons Pair Cycroid for Mobile Base material), 3 Vehicroid Connection Zone (protection and make Mobile Base cant be negated), 1 Poly (Keeper/Ophrys/Verte other target) and 1 Fusion Gate (Set Rotation target).  3 Megaroid City, Set Rotation, and Terraforming: Best card, searches Connection Zone or roid (Speedroid) monster.  1 Emegeroid Call: Negation, also Megaroid City target.  The rest is just staple cards.  Extra deck: 2 Mobile Base (it can summon its copy from extra deck), Pair Cycroid (combo piece). Jumbo Drill (piercing, for pushing damage), Kitedrake (beater and floats), and Chanbara (4.6k damage output) are all just Mobile Base target. Halq/Selene/Accesscode (OTK), Masq (small resource disruption), Cherubini (sends Daiko Duke for link climb/Halq play), Verte (plan B for fusion spell). Knightmares and Borreload as generic good link monster.  <img src=""https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/76-767269_syrus-truesdale-obelisk-blue-yu-gi-oh-gx.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Consistent 5k protected tower that generates plus every turn, can OTK, and big staple slot.  Cons: 3 cards combo, Megaroid City locks to fusion for the entire turn.  Cards to think of: Fusion Recycling Plant (great field but needs discard, we already have too many discard effect and we dont even need the recovered material, Tri-Eyed Dice is better in GY), Halq combo (summons roid from deck but clashes with Megaroid City, so its preferred to use Halq as OTK instead of going first)."

The easiest way is to get the spell card Cubic Karma into the graveyard. This can be done in a few ways, but Summoner Monk, Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel, and Foolish Burial Goods will be the main ways. I prefer going second with this deck, so that you can draw that first card and optimize your chance of being able to summon Crimson Nova.  Every Cubic spell and trap has a graveyard effect, so using cards like Twin Twisters, Karma Cut, and Darkword Dealings to send any spell/trap cards you have in your hand to the grave is usually the best move. <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Summoner Monk, activate his effect, discard any other spell from your hand (if you can discard Cubic Karma even better), to Special Summon Duza, the Meteor Cubic Vessel from your deck, then use Duza's  ability to send Cubic Karma from your deck to your graveyard. Banish Cubic Karma from your graveyard to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand - Crimson Nova. Cubic Karma is not once per turn, so if you get multiple in the grave, even better, start stacking your hand.</li>  	<li>Crimson Nova can be special summoned by revealing any 3 cubic cards from your hand, as long as they have different names.</li>  	<li>Once Crimson Nova's on the field, you should be able to OTK pretty easily. If Crimson Nova destroys a monster, he's allowed to make a second attack, and you can double his attack with Cubic Wave (as long as your opponent has a face up monster). This ATK increase is permanent too, if you don't OTK. You only need to hit your opponent with 5000 damage too, from there, Crimson Nova's ability with cause the OTK.</li>  	<li>If you get the the End Phase, Crimson Nova's ability triggers, and each player loses 3000 LP. Performapal Rain Goat protects you from taking damage if you have him in your hand though (just watch for hand traps like Called by the Grave).</li> </ul> Vijam is a great wall in a pinch, too, since he can't be destroyed by battle, if you need an extra turn to set up your hand.  I know Dark Garnex, Blade Garoodia, and Buster Gundil are bricks and aren't ideal, but from my play testing, I have never really had an issue with them. You can always swap in any three other cards; but I would still pick Cubic cards if you do, because you really want as many Cubic cards as possible for the best chance to summon Crimson Nova. This deck is obviously not meta in any way, and sometimes it's fun to play it different ways. It's not optimal, but getting out Buster Gundil once and while and having him attack 3 times with 3000 ATK is fun.  Not my best or most efficient deck, but it's one of my favorites to play. You can use combinations of Cubic Karma and Cubic Wave to get Crimson Nova's ATK to crazy numbers. Cubic Waves can stack too, so you can double his ATK multiple times. I've even gotten Crimson Nova's ATK over 21,000 ATK once or twice.  &nbsp;  Other Options: I've also seen some builds with Monster Gate and Magical Hats to get as many spells/traps into the grave as well; there's lot of room to explore."

Your main goal should be to protect your field spell. As long as you can do that, you should be fine. One of the coolest things about Pacifis is the versatility of the deck. Don't be afraid to try different builds.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  Spiral Dragon: 3 is too bricky, 1-2 should be enough. I've seen several decklists that just don't use him at all, but I think he is necessary to close up games a bit quicker.  Megalomasher X &amp; Mystery Shell Dragon: The goal here is to have 3-6 normal monsters, of course, other builds would have different rations of monsters. I went with Megalomasher b/c he is a dino (fossil dig), and he can summon Bahamut. Mystery Shell Dragon is a wyrm, meaning we can use him and spiral dragon for tenyi link plays. Plus, both of them have 2000 attack, which is the highest a normal monster can have.  Dimension Shifter: A few months ago this was ash blossom. I am not fully sure what the best hand trap would be here, as there are others I want to try, but these slots can go to whatever meta staple fits in your current format.  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  Heat Wave: Can shut down almost every deck, without hurting us one bit. Must have at 3.  Fossil Dig: See Megalomasher X  Terraforming: We need this because, despite all of the support Umi has, it does not have a searcher.  Phantasm Equip Spells: 2 of each except for wave, as we need to wait until the end of the battle phase to special summon a spiral dragon. Thankfully, it can make your opponent discard a card, so it isn't all bad.  Pacifis: Your key card, the thing that makes the deck viable. Must have at 3.  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  Metaverse: Since terraforming is limited, we have to run this as well.  Phantasm spiral battle &amp; power: Become hand traps when Umi is on the field. Battle is spell speed 2 destruction, while power is an in-archetype infinite impermanence. They also have their second effects, which come up, but are not essential to victory. We don't use trap trick because their appeal is in the fact that you can play them from your hand, and trap trick puts them onto the field. 3 battle and 1 power, but I am considering changing their ratios.  Sea Stealth Attack: Can recycle our Pacifis, protect it and our floodgates, while making our spiral dragon and token undefeatable in battle. 3-of.  Summon Limit: A floodgate that does nearly nothing to us while ruining our opponent's career. Sure, we cant make as big extra deck plays, but its not like we needed it to win.  Gozen Match: Another floodgate, as one can never have too many floodgates. Spiral dragon, ur phantasm tokens and megalomasher X are all water attribute monsters, so this card shouldn't hurt u much. Cant say the same about ur opponent. I am considering bringing it up to 3, but for now its at 2.  Skill Drain: The boss of all floodgates, this card can win you the duel on its own.  &nbsp;  For the extra deck, you can do whatever you want, or not run an extra deck at all. It's your choice. Note that other builds, the Extra Deck may have a lot more importance in the duel. In general, the only deck that shouldn't be running an extra deck at all is Monarchs.  The side deck right now is a mess, filled w/ ideas and speculation. As I perfect the build, the side deck will become clearer. For now though, I would recommend at the very least nibiru, droll, and dark ruler no more. If u have better cards in mind, go for what u thought of, I'm not the best deck-builder in the world.  Overall, pretty fun deck to play, maybe not so much for your opponent. But at least it's not mystic mine. All suggestions are welcome and appreciated."

Trying to get <strong>Dracoverlord</strong> out ASAP will net you wins easily, and is very easy to continually ritual summon turn after turn once you get set up.  Getting <strong>Phul</strong> out will start the Megalith combo, and it's pretty easy to get <strong>Phul</strong> out most of the time. You can use <em>Draitron Nova</em> and summon <strong>Al-Zeta</strong> for <em>Meteornis Draitron</em> and recycle it while still being able to use it for <strong>Phul</strong> with the left over 1,000 ATK Draitron. Megaliths quick-play spell <em>Megalith Unformed</em> will let you use a level 8 monster to get to <strong>Ophiel</strong> which can search and summon <strong>Phul</strong>.  The <strong>Cyber Angel Benten</strong> engine works amazingly within both archetypes, Megaliths for using tributes to ritual summon and Draitrons for their special summon cost being a tribute. After getting all 3 copies you can then search out <strong>Natasha</strong> and after ritual summoning her, which is as easy to do with Draitrons as <strong>Phul</strong> since <strong>Natasha</strong> only has 1,000 ATK, you can then continually steal monsters while also setting up Link or Xyz monsters.  After a while there will be plenty of ritual monsters in the GY to get a nice boost off of <strong>Phaleg</strong> to beat down anything. If you have the ritual spell <em>Meteornis Draitron</em> but no Draitron monsters out you can use the extra deck Machine monsters, and since they don't have a level they won't count towards the 2 star level requirement on both of the Draitron Ritual monsters. This works especially well if you can get <strong>Natasha</strong> out and steal a lot of monsters to link out for more ritual fodder.  The sidedeck has handtraps if you need them and some tech ritual monsters you can throw in for preference."

Budget Fossil Adamancipator Koa'ki Meiru deck running a small Neos engine to faci,"This is my first deck posted, hopefully the first of many more to come! :)  This deck combines 4 engines together and they work harmoniously together! This deck seeks to control the board with Raptite and Koa'ki Meiru until it can get Fossil monsters out for an OTK. This deck features 17 starters out of 45 cards, so this deck is relatively consistent. <ul>  	<li><strong>Koa'ki Meiru</strong> for field control and resources. Destroys themselves to fill graveyard with rock monsters allowing for fossil fusions. Ties of the Brethren allows for summons of 3 Koa'ki Meiru to provide negates and rank 4 plays.</li>  	<li><strong>Adamancipator</strong> increases consistency amongst rock monsters with excavations and provide sychro access to Raptite and more importantly, Dragite.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil</strong> with their fusion card allows access to powerful fossil fusion monsters by fusing rock monsters in your graveyard along with a monster in your opponents graveyard, kind of like Invocation. Fossil monsters have powerful piercing attacks making OTKs easier to achieve.</li>  	<li><strong>Neos</strong> Fusion to summon Brave Neos to the field sends directly from the deck a level 4 monster as part of it's material, allowing you to send Weathering Soldier to graveyard to search Fossil Fusion.</li> </ul> This deck is meant to be as budget as possible, so expensive cards like Adamancipator Researcher ($50+ USD right now) are taken out. Block Dragon is for free summon and rock monster searches. Nemeses Keystone is for recycling banished rock monsters.  Notable cards that can be added to this deck are: Magnet Reverse, Mathmatician, Keeper of Dragon Magic, Rock Bombardment, Gigantes and Tackle Crusader."

Normal summon ragged gloves and then you can use silent boots' effect to special summon him and you can then xyz summon the phantom knights of break sword, then you'll use break sword and the danger to link summon Union Carrier. From there you banish ragged gloves from grave to send Phantom Knights' Wing to grave and banish silent boots to search rank up magic. then you banish phantom knights wing to summon break sword from grave and use rank up magic to get to ophion, then use union carrier to equip buster dragon destruction sword to it. There are other ways to get to ophion but thats simply the easiest way that doesn't require interaction with your opponent."

HAT was a deck made of three different self sufficient engines, which meant dead hands were rare. HAT won't work today, but I think the idea could still work well.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>ENGINES</strong></span>  I chose to work with Evil Eye, Windwitch, Invoked, Dragun, and a small Artifact and Spellbook engine as well. Every single one of these engines can get started with just one card, so even in a 60 card deck you won't dead draw. Running 60 cards also lowers your chances of drawing cards you wouldn't want to normally, such as the normal monsters, scythe, or snow bell. It also gives us plentiful room for hand traps.  Evil Eye - IMO this is an underrated engine right now. Drawing either the field spell or Serziel will give you a normal summonable sticky boss monster that has a quick effect removal. It also allows you to search Basillius, which is a free link 2, which opens up Verte Anaconda for Dragun plays. There are 7 cards you could draw (including terraforming) to get this engine going, and drawing any of the other cards isn't a big deal.  Invoked - The other main engine of the deck, invoked is a bit less good since you aren't guaranteed to draw a light for Mechaba, but it does give you access to Caliga which is another underrated card IMO. Invoked works much the same as evil eye, as drawing either the field spell or Aleister will get the engine going. Once Aleister is summoned once, the fusion spell with recycle him every turn, making sure you always have a play.  Both of these engines rely on the field spell to get started, but neither one particularly cares if it stays on the field, making them easily replaceable with one another.  Windwitch - Another 1 card boss monster, Ice bell is a Crystal Wing by itself. Drawing a glass bell can search you the Ice bell for the next turn as well. As a good half of these engines rely on the normal summon, Windwitch is a great addition since it doesn't ever need to normal.  Spellbook - This also relies on its normal, but both Blue boy and Secrets gives you a draw 2. If you happen to draw Knowledge on its own, you also run spellcasters in Windwitch, Invoked, and in a pinch Dragun is also a spellcaster.  Dragun - Free link 2s means free Red-eyes Fusions. Dragun is a ridiculous boss monster, with the only cost being having to run a few normal monsters. In a 60 card deck, this is less of a problem, and since you can fuse from the deck it's only an upside. Using the spell on its own stops you from summoning for the turn, but if you use Verte Anaconda you can get around this effect.  Artifact - Scythe is a crazy card right now. Locking you out of the extra deck is insane. Ideally you never draw scythe and only draw the sanctums, which again is more likely in a 60 card deck.  Hand Traps - I'm choosing to run Ash because its Ash, Omega for Numeron, and Ghost Ogre and Nibiru for the light attribute which can also be used to make Mechaba. I did try Infinite Impermanence as well, but I was really missing that light attribute.  &nbsp;  Your win condition for this deck can change every game.

Every time i see an archetype with beautiful artworks i try for a long time ways to make it playable (failing miserably most of the time). And that’s exactly what happened when i saw the cards from the new structure deck ""Spirit Charmers"".  This list is the best i could do so far.  I'm enjoying the ""Performage"" package. Hat Tricker is just perfect:  He is EARTH, He is spellcaster, and he is a good extender for rank 4 plays or for ""Awakening of the Possessed - Archfiend Reaper of Nefariousness"". Speaking of which, we want to summon it from the deck as soon as possible to make a Charmer link monster and search a ""possessed"" spell/trap. Trick Clown and Damage Juggler can be discarder in different ways (Danger cards, Dark World Dealings, Masters of the Spiritual Arts) and let us to extend our plays.  Let’s focus now on some specific cards: <ol>  	<li>Awakening of the Possessed. We want to have multiple copies on the field. This card let you draw 1 card (hard once per turn unfortunately) but most important makes your monsters BIG (big big).</li>  	<li>Bagooska. Best rank 4 monster we have, he let us to do a decent board going first and he doesn't affect our ""Charmer"" link monsters.</li>  	<li>Fairy Tail - Luna. My MVP for this deck with Awakening of the Possessed. She is just so versatile (i'm thinking on building a going second-based deck with kaijus and rainbow neos package, we'll see).</li> </ol> I'm going to try different ways to play this archetype since i still have a couple of months before the release of the structure deck.

I love the Legendary Dragons of Critias. Since you run <a data-name=""Crush Card Virus"">Crush Card Virus</a> in this deck, it's quite obvious that you also run the <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a><a data-name=""Lair of Darkness""> package.</a>  <strong>Important Notes on the Deck and the Decklist: </strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>It's a strict casual deck. No chance here against the meta. But since it's a fun casual deck, it can pull some fun duels and wins off.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>The sidedeck in this decklist are rather ""honorable mentions"" cards and not an actual side deck! It's just to keep some different strategies in mind if I'm going to work on this deck again.</strong></li> </ul> Some explanation for certain cards:  <strong><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a></strong>  Since you run a lot of traps, your opponent is going to try to pop as many backrow cards as he can. So it's perfect to play Waking the Dragon in this deck.  I've the following targets in my extra deck: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The Last Warrior from another Planet"">The Last Warrior from another Planet</a> If your opponent pops Waking the dragon before he controls any monsters, the last warrior will completely shut down your opponent until he has a spell / trap removal.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a> If you play against a backrow-heavy deck, this is the ideal target. It can negate any spell / trap, and <strong>it's not once per turn!</strong> And since this deck doesn't use the graveyard at all, you can banish anything you like, except <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> The counterpart to Naturia Exterio. Great beater with monster-effect negations.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> The main beater target. Unaffected by card effects and 3500 ATK.</li> </ul> The possibility that <a data-name=""Waking the dragon"">Waking the dragon</a> gets popped more than once is there, so it's good to have multiple targets in your extra deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a></strong>  I simply love this card. You're able to search out any material for your Legendary Dragon of Critias (except for <a data-name=""Tyrant Burst Dragon"">Tyrant Burst Dragon</a>. But he's not that good and I only have him in the deck is because I like to play all of the dragons...). Another neat combo is, when you have a set <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>, and your opponent activates <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, you can activate it and set a <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>, which immediatly get's destroyed.  <strong><a data-name=""Spirit Reaper"">Spirit Reaper</a></strong>  Staller (the deck is quite slow) and target for the classic <a data-name=""Card Crush Virus"">Card Crush Virus</a>.  The rest should be self explanatory.  I really like this deck, but I know it's not that strong. So if you have any recommendations on how to improve this deck <strong>without losing on it's main focus, the dragons</strong>, feel free to comment. Oh, and I value fun to play over strength."

Make sure Final Sigma is in the extra monster zone to gain its protection and double damaging effects.

Basically, you are trying to get out the <strong>Sun Dragon Inti</strong> and <strong>Moon Dragon Quilla</strong> loop. Nothing else to say except that there is a Charmer engine using their new cards.  Full Combo is ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>,"" ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>,"" (with cards for their discards) and <strong>Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness</strong>. ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" and ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" Special Summon themselves after you discard a card. Then they Special Summon their respective tuner monsters which are <strong>Supay</strong> and<strong> Fire Ant Ascator</strong>. From here, if you have og <strong>Archfiend Eater</strong>, you can Special Summon him as you control a Spellcaster. Then, you can Special Summon<strong> Archfiend Reaper</strong> from your deck by tributing a spellcaster and an earth monster. You should really choose to tribute either ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" or ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" and <strong>Supay</strong> or <strong>Ascator</strong>. Both <strong>Supay</strong> and <strong>Ascator</strong> float into something (<strong>Ascator</strong> summons a level 5 from the grave and <strong>Supay</strong> summon<strong>s Oracle of the Sun</strong> from Deck).<strong> Archfiend Reaper</strong> summons back a level 4 monster from the grave which should be the tuner you tributed. Then once you use <strong>Reaper</strong> for the synchro summon of<strong> Inti</strong> or <strong>Quilla</strong>, he can add a <strong>Possessed</strong> Spell/Trap from your deck.<strong> Inti</strong> and<strong> Quilla</strong> summon each other after being destroyed.  <strong>Possessed Lyna</strong> searches ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" when shes summoned by her effect. <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> gets you to your combo pieces. The <strong>Possessed</strong> cards just get you closer to your combo pieces also. <strong>Oracle of the Sun</strong> really has no purpose here except for being a target for <strong>Supay</strong> and <strong>Ascator</strong>. <strong>Dimmered Path</strong> recycles your ""<strong>Ascator, Dawnwalker</strong>"" and ""<strong>Supay, Duskwalker</strong>"" for next turn (kinda was just putting in cards to get to 40 cards).  <strong>Naturia Barkion</strong> negates<strong> Infinite Impermanence</strong>. <strong>Red Reign</strong> is for that small chance of a 1000 IQ play.  Interpret the side deck however you want. I don't see this deck actually winning games. Inca are just the cards used by Rex Goodwin in the anime; there is no real consistency."

Youre still stuck trying to grind out as many Dl s/t as possible, so this deck wont ever really reach peak until they release a 2021 field spell like the Draitron one  Saffira is a funny ritual, and most Dl monsters are high lvl so any ritual summon is ez enough. That said, pre prep and ritual sanctuary help with searching for both the spell and monster you wish to use.  Ankuriboh is one of the most busted kuriboh because it gets to SS from your grave. What do you SS? Superbia. Then a fairy since no timing interruptions.  Athena is a bad card in most cases. In here, she can send 1 fairy monster you control to the GY, and get back 2 with Superbia."

""Why are you summoning so much?? It's my turn!!"" ""How did you wipe my board again??"" Welcome to Prank-Kids,","Infinite combos and recycling like you would not believe in this deck. You can literally summon either of your boss monsters and board wipe during your opponent's turn without incurring cost thanks to Meow-Meow. It's a 1-card free combo off of any Prank-Kids monster to get a crazy set-up. If you start with any extra resources in your hand (an extra monster, fusion spell, field card, pretty much anything) you can generally combo into both of your boss monsters during your opponent's turn and completely destroy any hope they had of even playing the game.  The ratios I play are pretty standard, the deck just flows like this. I play 3 of the field spell and Terraforming just to bump my odds to 16 cards in my deck that will let me get off my combo. Thunder Dragon Fusion is pretty essential just so there's less fear if I'm forced to banish one of my Prank-Kids off of Rocksies. I saw someone else using The Last Warrior From Another Planet and Cyber-Stein, and I thought it was neat, but not strong enough to include in my main deck, so I've put it in my side just in case I ever want to pull it out, but to be honest, I almost never have to side deck, just because there's not much that can play through this deck (I think I've only ever had to when playing banish-eccentric opponents just to get a second Battle-Butler). If someone can successfully stop the combo early enough, Prank-Kids are done for, but I already play Ash and Called By The Grave at 3 each, and that's about all I've ever really needed.  If I had to change anything, I'd just make space in the side deck for more hand traps and negates, maybe add Infinite Impermanence or Lightning Storm, but realistically, those cards are way too expensive for me anyways.  Always try to go first with this deck just to get your set-up, especially since Meow-Meow can only banish itself during your opponent's turn.  The biggest counter to this deck that I've seen is anything that banishes. Dimension Shifter, Dark Law, Dimensional Fissure, and Macro Cosmos just make me want to die.  If you have any questions about combo tutorials or any ratios that I play, leave a comment down below and I'll try to explain!  &nbsp;"

Extradeck is filled with double and triple copies of important cards to decrease the probability to banish everything that you need. PoE is in the end a ""gamble"" that you may lose sometimes, not often but there's still a certain % to banish everything you need. Always banish 6 for the +2 draw, banishing only 3 is a 1 for 1 exchange with no benefit at all. Also PoE may help sometimes as a bait to get rid of an Ash Blossom, if you already have everything you need to play - just making sure to have an exchange.  <em>Numeron Network and Numeron Wall:</em> none of both are Ash'able because Wall doesn't add to hand, it straight up activates and Network sends as cost. If going 1st and able to play the Numeron play just summon 3 Numeron Gates and go into S0 (Nibiru proof play and lockdown for 3 turns). If going 2nd summon 4 Numeron Gates and OTK, this is the only OTK you have in this deck and it actually is pretty viable. You can find online charts for the calculations, in what scenarios you are able to OTK or if your opponent will survive this round. At this point I would just pass on a video, skip to 4:50 to see the chart. <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOg2GYk1f4o</a>  Also Numeron Wall can protect you from getting OTK'd.  <em>Rikka Xyz: </em>Your main control monster is Teardrop the Rikka Queen, besides S0. Kanzashi the Rikka Queen is decent and if possible should be made after Teardrop, regarding Duelingnexus I have encountered a bug that you can't summon from your opponent GY's as in the replay I wanted to summon BEAWD but couldn't choose it.  <em>Terraforming, Mystic Mine and DRNM:</em> Terraforming can be either a Ash bait, enabler for the Numeron play or complete Shutdown by searching Mystic Mine. Having Mystic Mine in the Start hand is basically a free negation bait or a Shutdown for grinding against Combodecks. DRNM is supposed to break boards with Numeron Gates: summon 4 clear whatever you fear and go into S0.  <em>Rikka Traps:</em> Decent but not a must have - searchable via Petal and situational super cards, running only 1-1 because they might brick and either way playing enough control overall. Rikka Tranquility is supposed to make an Xyz, may be sided out for something superior if the duels ain't really grind-heavy. 1 Rikka Sheet in Sidedeck because it is actually a good Trap for the reason alone it is searchable.  <em>Rikka effects in general:</em> In my replays I have never used an effect to optional tribute a Plant to gain the additional effect, because most of the time it may sound decent but is overall a disadvantage in my opinion.  <em>Extra Deck breakdown:</em>  Nibiru, Lightning Storm, DRNM, Summon Limit against Combo Decks  Lightning Storm, Heavy Storm Duster, Cosmic Cyclone against Backrow heavy Decks.  Royal Decree, Red Reboot in addition to the Backrow heavy Decks but specific for Trap heavy decks as Eldlich variants."

I think anyone who's been to locals has probably run into one of these decks before, and probably has a few choice words for anyone who plays these decks. So how's about we mash them together and make everyone mad?  &nbsp;  The deck can brick, all decks do. But a good hand allows for you to play Guru at first, and then pop off with Altergeist during your opponent's turn. <strong>The perfect hand is: </strong>The Hidden City, Subterror Guru, Subterror Final Battle, Solemn Judgment, and Altergeist Multifaker. Even if you get Ash Blossomed, you can get Guru on the field with two set back row, and Hidden City. But again, that's a perfect hand.  Honestly, you're just looking to play one side of the deck, and drop the other side either during your opponent's turn or right when you're backed into a corner. The side deck is built in a way that should allow you to switch to either Guru Control or Altergeist Control for games 2 and 3."

A lot of decks are playing combo and are unprepared for the grind game, and IMO, Eldlich control is the best grindgame deck in the game right now, provided you build it for that. People argue Salamangreats can grind further, since they don't have to banish their traps, but Eldlich can overwhelm them with more interaction in the early game, and go for the kill with Trains.  I started with basic Eldlich numbers, 3 Red, 1 White, 3 of each (good) Trap Monster, 3 Lord, 3 Eldland, 1 Countertrap (this will never change till these are hit on the banlist, or new trap monsters are printed). I also think 3 Lost Wind is really core to control builds of Eldlich - they help improve the deck's grind game, and actively want to be binned for Golden Lord or Souls. 3 Souls are the deck's normal summon - why run a brick when you don't have to? These are the main card advantage engine of the deck, and a great combo with Cursed Eldland. The last of the trap suite is slightly spicy.  I knew I wanted to run Dinomiscus this format in control. It's a generic answer to any card that can be targeted, it bins Golden lord, but more importantly, it banishes Golden Lord as well as Block Dragon. The extra effect of summoning a monster to use as material is generically useful as well, and gives the deck access to Eria the Water Charmer Gentle. Solemn Judgement makes a lot of sense. I was considering Compulse or the Trap Hole that banishes, but honestly, you should always run the Solemn cards before those. Judgement and Strike are both cards which uniquely answer a variety cards on generic counter traps, but I chose 3 Judgement and 2 Strike, because the deck already has a lot of monster effect negation, even if it's only on field negation.  I'm running Veiler instead of Gamma because the deck wants to grind out games, and be able to activate hand traps after the first turn while on the board. Gamma felt dead for this slower game plan a lot of the time. Also, this way only Ash Blossom and the Eldlich cards are hard once per turns, meaning seeing multiples of cards is less bad.

Thus eldlich cards are a great target for danger or lightsworn to be discarded or milled into the grave.  Thus, the strategy of this deck is to:  1: summon/special summon lightsworn and danger monsters (or use the effect of spell cards like hand/card destruction and reasoning) to discard/mill eldlich cards, jet synchron, and mecha phantom beast olion into the grave.  2: use the tuners (lightsworn raiden,  jet synchron, mecha phantom) to abuse crystron needlefiber and auroradon to summon A: Blazar or B: Borreload Savage and Herald or C: otk with knightmare unicorn + accesscode talker. The Blazar combo is in this video: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/qb_zKsaAXZw"">https://youtu.be/qb_zKsaAXZw</a>  3: use the search/revive effect of the eldlich cards in the grave to set up eldlich disruptions.  The main deck has no hand traps, thus the side deck is filled with handtraps. In the case that a player using this deck is playing a match against a combo deck and he/she knows that his/her opponent is going first, they can side in the handtraps, replacing filler pieces and making this a pure lightsworn eldlich deck with a lot of handtraps. What to side out is the player's choice, but I would suggest keeping the lightsworn engine and the parts of the crucial combo pieces (jet synchron, mecha phantom, deskbot 001) that allows the auroradon combo."

I have tested this deck, and its crazy good. I hope it can get at least 10k views like my first did. I think it got more than that though. Spread the word to your friends. This deck is really good. Its just a basic Trickstar deck but it really works against the meta, trust me and it hardly bricks. Its a going first build. I want to mention a couple of things you guys might be questioning about my card picks... So first off, the extra deck... ah yes it may be a little confusing at first but <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> is a good Ghost Reaper target PLUS it can be summoned off <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>'s effect when its sent to the graveyard. This is a countermeasure against Dogmatika! Same with <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>. A lot of the extra deck is Ghost Reaper targets because in my personal opinion, Ghost Reaper is really strong and slows down most decks or completely kills them. Also I know you see <a data-name=""Life Stream Dragon"">Life Stream Dragon</a>, its a beatstick from Needlefiber's effect! You can summon it from Needlefiber's second effect, tagging out for Life Stream Dragon. I wanted to make good use of Needlefiber and not just have it as a Ghost Reaper target because late game it can come up where you have only handtraps and you can summon 2 ashes for example, in the grind game to make Needlefiber and then during your opponent's turn tag out for Life Stream.

It's the Archfiend Guy again :D  This deck is all about recycling, reviving, searching and destroying with some of the biggest Archfiend monsters around. Archfiend Empress is a fantastic 2900 beater that can protect your other fiends, and also revive stronger Archfiends from the grave. Use cards such as Rhino Warrior, Cherubini and Void Apocalypse to fill the grave with monsters, and recycle your Dark Spirit of Banishment and Malice to Special Summon them back to the field. Combine this with Call of the Archfiend, and that almost guarantees two forms of summoning per turn, making it difficult for your opponent to deal with.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/_MY-_UKkIJQ"">Check out the deck profile here</a>  Enjoy, and I'll see you around!"

The group of archetypes consisting of ""Fluffals"", ""Edge Imps"" and ""Frightfurs"" work in unison to create a strong, consistent and OTK-able Fusion deck with various combos and approaches regarding gameplay, and its overall interactivity explains why the deck is so widely popular.</p> <p>The Main Deck is all about fetching the right cards to allow for multiple Fusion summons and to build a board that can clear the way and go for the face. To reach such a goal, we have a number of solid cards to work with. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>"" is one of your various searchers and fetches other ""Fluffals"" and ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"" upon being summoned from the hand, which can be easily combined with ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"", which allows for the Special Summon of another ""Fluffal"" from the hand. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" is also very useful as Fusion material, since it allows you to draw two cards and discard one when used for a Fusion, which is a definite plus and potential setup depending on what you discarded. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a>"" is a searchable searcher for ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" as well as having a Fusion effect on it own, while ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a>"" can reuse ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" when it is used as Fusion material. Both ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a>"" are only at one, since they are searchable and not really necessary at higher numbers. I also added one copy of ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Angel"">Fluffal Angel</a>"" for testing purposes, which mostly comes into play as a Spell card that can revive monsters, but is more searchable than other options the deck would have at its disposal (with ""<a data-name=""Suture Rebirth"">Suture Rebirth</a>"" being unsearchable and ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Reborn"">Frightfur Reborn</a>"" only being able to revive the wrong cards most of the time; both of those are not in the deck for said reasons).</p> <p>One cannot talk about ""Fluffals"" without mentioning ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"". This card does pretty much everything, from card draw and searches to setup and summoning. For this reason, there are also a few cards in the deck that can interact with the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"": ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a>"" can be discarded to search for them, ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>"" can fetch them back from the graveyard while also having a very useful ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" effect alongside that and ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>"" can destroy it for a draw two effect with an added search, meaning a major plus in card economy.</p> <p>On the ""Edge Imp"" side of things, I am running one copy of ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"", since it is easily searchable via the plethora of effects at your disposal while also featuring its own revive effect (which can also be used to setup ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>'s"" summon effect), ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>"" is at three since it searches for cards and the newer ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a>"" is also featured at three copies for the ability of Fusion summoning monsters as a Quick Effect during the opposing turn without the need of using a Fusion Spell.</p> <p>The Spell line-up is pretty standard for a ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" deck: Three ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" are absolutely paramount since you will Fusion summon a lot and can search for it in your own archetype, three ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"" are there for all manner of effects and interactions, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>"" for being a straight +1 as a searcher, three ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"" mainly to send ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"" directly to the graveyard to trigger its search effect and both one copy of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a>"" shenanigans and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>"" mostly for the secondary effect that allows you to summon additional monsters from the hand. The last three slots I filled with one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" to ditch either ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" for easy backrow removal and to possibility to destroy my own ""Toy Vendor"" alongside some opposing backrow to profit from the search and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" to go into ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"", which not only is a nice fit for a ""Frightfur"" deck due to its effects but also gets rid of opposing monsters in the process. These last three choices are absolutely debatable, but I tend to keep my decks fairly budget-friendly and the copies of ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>"" that are currently found in other ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" decks are fairly expensive.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is also pretty straightforward: ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a>"" is all the rage right now, and for good reason since it offers destruction, setup and ATK boosts in one fell swoop. ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>"" allows for non-destruction removal and multiple attacks, ""<a data-name=""Dangerous Frightfur Nightmary"">Dangerous Frightfur Nightmary</a>"" can grow into a sizeable beater while bringing her own setup and protection, ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"" clears the way and buffs your monsters while ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a>"" potentially attacks for 5+ times; ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a>"" is probably the least useful member, but has its merit in certain matchups. On the more generic side, I run one ""<a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>"" (easily summonable via ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" and the added summon of a ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>"") to summon ""<a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>"" and steal opposing cards. The ""<a data-name=""Cross Sheep"">Cross Sheep</a>"" is there for even more insanity with the right board, since it allows for the resummon of ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" or other monsters which can use their effects multiple times per turn if they leave the field in some way.</p> <p>My list is actually pretty similar to various other ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" lists, but after reading through the archetype you will automatically find certain ratios and cards to be desireable, which is why so many people come up with similar lists and results when it comes to ""Fluffals"" and ""Frightfurs"".</p> <p>If you want to know more about the archetype in general and maybe take a look at an analysis that features all the cards the three archetypes have on offer, feel free to visit my archetype analysis for ""Fluffals"", ""Edge Imps"" and ""Frightfurs"" on my blog under this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/archetype-analysis-fluffal-edge-imp-frightfur/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/archetype-analysis-fluffal-edge-imp-frightfur/</a>.</p>"

The objective is to summon Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord. The easiest way is to get the spell card Cubic Karma into the graveyard. This can be done in a few ways, but Summoner Monk, Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel, and Foolish Burial Goods will be the main ways. I prefer going second with this deck, so that you can draw that first card and optimize your chance of being able to summon Crimson Nova, and to make use of things like Lightning Storm (and Evenly Match, but I put that in the Side Deck).  Every Cubic spell and trap has a graveyard effect, so using cards like Twin Twisters, Karma Cut, and Darkword Dealings to send any spell/trap cards you have in your hand to the grave is usually the best move. <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Summoner Monk, activate his effect, discard any other spell from your hand (if you can discard Cubic Karma even better), to Special Summon Duza, the Meteor Cubic Vessel from your deck, then use Duza's  ability to send Cubic Karma from your deck to your graveyard. Banish Cubic Karma from your graveyard to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand - Crimson Nova. Cubic Karma is not once per turn, so if you get multiple in the grave, even better, start stacking your hand.</li>  	<li>Crimson Nova can be special summoned by revealing any 3 cubic cards from your hand, as long as they have different names.</li>  	<li>Once Crimson Nova's on the field, you should be able to OTK pretty easily. If Crimson Nova destroys a monster, he's allowed to make a second attack, and you can double his attack with Cubic Wave (as long as your opponent has a face up monster). This ATK increase is permanent too, if you don't OTK.</li>  	<li>You only need to hit your opponent with 5000 damage too, from there, Crimson Nova's ability with cause the OTK. If you get the the End Phase, Crimson Nova's ability triggers, and each player loses 3000 LP. Performapal Rain Goat protects you from taking damage if you have him in your hand though (just watch for hand traps like Called by the Grave).</li> </ul> Vijam is a great wall in a pinch, too, since he can't be destroyed by battle, if you need an extra turn to set up your hand.  I know Geira Guile, Blade Garoodia, and Buster Gundil are bricks and aren't ideal, but from my play testing, I have never really had an issue with them. You can always swap in any three other cards; but I would still pick Cubic cards if you do, because you really want as many Cubic cards as possible for the best chance to summon Crimson Nova. This deck is obviously not meta in any way, and sometimes it's fun to play it different ways. It's not optimal, but getting out Buster Gundil once and while and having him attack 3 times with 3000 ATK is fun.  In this deck, you're always looking for ways to burn your opponent (Crimson Nova's effect mainly), but Geira Guile, Gagaga Cowboy, Gustav Max, and Blackship of Corn are all there to help boost that burn damage for an OTK.  Not my best or most efficient deck, but it's one of my favorites to play. You can use combinations of Cubic Karma and Cubic Wave to get Crimson Nova's ATK to crazy numbers. Cubic Waves can stack too, so you can double his ATK multiple times. I've even gotten Crimson Nova over 21,000 ATK once or twice.  &nbsp;  Other Options: I've also seen some builds with Monster Gate and Magical Hats to get as many spells/traps into the grave as well; I've tried those, but I didn't prefer them. I've also tried some Barrel Behind the Door builds where you send Crimson Nova's effect damage that you receive back at your opponent, but it wasn't very consistent. There's lots of room to explore."

The board goal to end on is spirit dragon, seals, triple burst(can be subbed out for borrelsword) and either hope harbinger or photon lord. A really good hand will get all of those on the field. Using seals to bounce a card and summon amorphage goliath is crucial. You can use heart earth dragon with draglubion if you're confident he won't get popped. Photon dragon is here for photon lord to yoink out of the deck on the next turn. Getting off noctovision and chaos space in the same turn is insane since nocto is a free special summon and both of them have an effect to let you draw a card."

Instead, use the other monsters in the hand to keep your monsters on the board alive.

This is still a control deck though and can make set 5 and pass!,"So for this new deck im playing spellbooks but with a mythical beast engine. Unfortuntely there is not much i can talk about this new deck as its a control deck so i will tell what decks I am working on instead. This deck has 65% winrate but i found almost impossible to get something higher than that.  Coming Soon:  Thunder Dragoon Chaos - Thunder Dragons, Red-eyes Dragoon, Chaos all mixed into 1 deck  Dragoon Spyral - Personally i think Spyral actually works with dragoon now so i'll be trying to build that  Volcanics - This deck is consistent at producing interruptions and even scattershots  chain block the raigeki!  Isolde/Paleo Orcust - A deck which is is 100% a more consistent verison of orcust. both of which is eiser to combo off.  &nbsp;  Cards i play and why:  Ill try to keep this short but there is a few cards i wanted to go over.  Mythical Beast Engine - Master Cerberus is a card which is really hard to deal with and jackal can bring out jackal king which is a negate  Dogmatika Punishment - Pop 2 with it send n'tss and then u can pop another one  Spellbook Engine - More interuptions more draw power more removal.  Extra is important i do go into crowley, selene accesscdoe a lot. Nova and Mechaba is for dogmatika matchups.  Hopefully u enjoy the deck and be free to send any feedback."

What you want to do is get Exodius out with Spirit Barrier on the field and Safe Zone equipped to him. At that point, Exodius is protected from nearly everything and you don't have to worry about taking damage. All you have to do is attack any of the opponent's monsters five times.

I haven't been doing that in a while, and that's my favorite deck. So I made this deck profile, aptly named ""UCT Is MVP!"" Anyone who says Ultimate Conductor Tyranno isn't one of the most broken boss monsters in Yu-Gi-Oh is either a liar or an idiot.  &nbsp;  Now, this deck is meant to go second, but if going first, it can potentially set up a nice board consisting of Ultimate Conductor Tyranno and Evolzar Dollka/Laggia--maybe you'll also get a hand trap or two. Jurrac Aeolo is in here because as a Tuner you can summon with Babycerasaurus, it makes a great extender to link climb into Needlefiber, Selene, and Accesscode Talker. And if Accesscode Talker and UCT isn't enough to OTK the opponent, the Extra Deck also has Borrelsword Dragon."

While certainly not Meta worthy, I hope it may be able to compete in that area, as I've put qite a lot of thought and research into this deck.  Basically, if you have the ability to, you want to get out Shaman of the Tenyi with Mare Mare in the grave so that you can get Sahasrara with Mare and a Mini-Mare. If you go second, you can get a Spirit Token, and therefore a Berserker by way of Linkuriboh, ending up with 2 monsters with 3000 ATK. Mystic Mine is in there to stall, and Cynet Storm is there, 'cause a) why not? and b) works with Set Rotation. Notice some cards can be bricks... hence the Side Deck. Note also that if you incorporate some of the Side Deck, you can get White Aura Bihumat (on your opponent's turn, no less). Here's how:  Step 1: Get Halqifibrax (should be easy enough)  Step 2: Use it's effect and get Jet Synchron and use to get Linkuriboh  Step 3: Summon Jet from the Grave, use Linkuriboh and Jet to get Dagda  Step 4: Use Dagda to set Scythe  Step 5: On opponent's turn, banish Halqifibrax for Wonder Magician  Step 6: Destroy Scythe using Wonder Magician's effect, then use Scythe and Wonder Magician to get Bihamut  Congradulations! Your mind has been broken (btw this was taken from a somewhat popular article by baMMax. Giving credit where it's due)."

Having Archlord Kristya is big for stopping summons  and other plays by your opponent. If you have tri-wight you can use it to pure light and get more fairies in hand at the cost of not being able to play Kristya. The side deck is for being more competitive I just wanted to have fun. Btw quick not rotated out a tri-wight up to you it helps with Nibiru again up to you.

Use Union Carrier to equip Mist Valley Thunderbird to Simorgh, during the end phase summon Ape Avian from the had or deck with Simorgh. Proceed to negate a lot of stuff. Otherwise summon the barrier statue if you think you'll need it more.  With simorgh onslaught, you can get the birds in your hand and in your graveyard. You can either normal summon them (you get extra normal summons with bird of the beginning and the field card) or you can try to get them in the graveyard to use their special summoning effect.  The synchros and xyzs are there for when things go wrong and you either need more cards or to destroy your opponent's stuff. Nahata and unexpected dai help getting them out.  If you manage to succesfully lock your opponent out of his turn you can use borreload, and S39 to finish your opponent, if you need to stall longer summon what's left between Dark Simorgh, the barrier statue and Apex avian.  Possible cheap additions to this deck are anti spell fragrance to combo with Dark Simorgh or Harpie's Feather Storm."

We run 9 Prologue and dragon link engine easily fulfill the materia,"No Linkross, no Elpy, it means we only use minimal dragon link combo. We turbo Romulus via Striker Dragon like usual, add Boot Sector Launch and Ravine, use Ravine discard 1 (Memories should be the discard priority if drawn, Dragon Buster comes next) send Absorouter, use Absorouter add Tracer, use Boot Sector ss Tracer, use Tracer pops field ss Synchron, make Pisty on the left zone, then make Striker Dragon again like standard, use Pisty ss 1 dragon, make Borrelend. Set Prologue/Trap Trick to complete the combo. We can have Dragon Buster lock by sending it with Prologue from deck or Ravine from hand if we already guaranteed to have Memories in GY.  The main deck is mainly consist of extender to support normal summoned Buster Whelp for dragon link. REDMD, Noctovision, Monster Reborn, Quick Launch, and World Legacy Guardragon are the perfect choice for it. Only 2 Black Metal Dragon cus its not our main normal summon but its still a 1 card dragon link (but we have to hard draw Prologue/Trap Trick). The rest is just staples.  Pros: Super consistent, big monsters, floodgate effect, many staples.  Cons: Bad matchup against backrow deck, link monster cant be in def position."

If your opponent likes special summoning from hand, slap them with a 1000 LP tax on it with Queen of Thorns. Cauldron is just to help with LP, but in case you go up against Mystic Mine and you have it, tell them to f*** off by playing it and watching them burn. Remember to chain block; all the Aromage effects will activate at the same time and are mandatory, though a lot of them are soft once per turn.

So far this deck has been a lot of fun playing against my friends (and long time Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts) during our evening, ""Duels @ Dusk!"". I think the strategy is pretty self-explanatory when looking at the provided deck list. Not sure if it would be considered meta, but, even without the use of a side deck, I'm 12-0 against ALL of my friend's and their best decks.  Please, feel free to drop some knowledge, as I am somewhat new to the current game as it stands! I like to chat about possible strategies!  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Added a few extra tech monsters/spells to the deck for a few different options. Each variation of the deck performed almost entirely the same way (obviously), unless the effect of the new tech was introduced. 15-1 as of this evening 9/5/2020  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Played a couple games last night with an extra Mathematician. The three Mathematician actually helped the flow of the strategy. This is the best build I've had luck with so far using an almost pure Earth/rock theme to summon Fossils! 9/6/2020  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The deck felt cluttered this evening and after adding so many different tech cards, it felt as if they were only slowing down the main focus: find Fossil Fusions and summon from the extra deck. I ended up removing a lot of the fodder cards and settled on more direct approach. relying on the Adamancipator engine to excavate those lower level cards that help my strategy more, rather than trying to negate the opponent at every turn. This build feels much faster (removing cards such as Gate Blocker, Tackle Crusader and the third Block Dragon) although, I think the single Primineral Kongreat will be swapped out for the full playset of Block Dragons.

So you can special summon with it multiple times within one turn if you run multiple copies or bounce it back to your hand with cards like Blackwing Zephyros the Elite. I chose World Chalice to go with the Empowered engine since it's a combo heavy deck and somewhat focuses on Normal Monsters that the Empowered have some synergy with. Mainly Beckoned by World Chalice since it's a Warrior and can therefore bring out Isolde which is a great combo maker. The deck can make some pretty crazy combos but isn't as consistent as some more ""mainstream"" combo decks. It has a lot of bricks like the bamboo cards and 3 normal monsters. Never the less the deck is really fun to use. I often ended up making misplays because I got overwhealmed by the possible ways I can end the combos.</span>  Replays: https://youtu.be/ZQo4DVJkswg"

Because of this, I had to try them out in Traditional Format and they do indeed work amazing as a early play for turboing the Orcust combo, as well as help lead to really crazy combos.  Adding them to the typical Traditional Format Orcust deck gives them a bit of a boost to them, just watch out for hand traps of course. The Predaplant Engine can search out Dimension Fusion for even more explosive plays. Rarely are any of these cards dead in your hand, especially with some of the new Phantom Rage support.  Side deck is alternative options you can try."

Built-in extenders, main deck boss monsters, ROTAs for days, plenty of one card combos, and even the ability to hand loop.  I wanted to run all the extra bells and whistles as well as full numbers of the combo pieces, but I didn't want to force myself to run 60 cards. I want to consistently combo off, I want to run interaction and protection, and I want those ""extenders"" that make hand looping better, or allow me to make 3 negates.  ROTA is ROTA, it's a Warrior deck, nuff said. Heritage of the Chalice searches for any Infernoble extender, as well as Durendal (thining, searching), or Arfeudutyr (backrow removal). Durendal is especially important as rotas 5-7, because you can loop it out of the GY with Renaud after sending it with Isolde. I'm running back down to 1 Smoke Grenade of the Thief. I do like to see it, actually, but not as much as an actual starter or extender, and the deck always sends it with Isolde, so access to it is still virtually guaranteed. Living Fossil is one of 4 extenders in the deck - maybe okay as a backup to start combos, or in combo with Oliver, mostly here as Equip fodder, because we need 5 different names (in case we see a brick).  Ogier is essential to run for her Equip effect, but 3 of her and 3 of Renaud help make your most reliable opening combos and anti-Nibiru combos more easily. Astolfo is only here because she's technically sort of necessary for certain Infernoble combos, and a decent extender in its own right, worth it as a 1 of to search out for the combos. Oliver is another essential combo piece - you're happy to see all of these, (but notably search most of them out in the usual combo anyways). 3 Gearfried seems essential in this deck, more than 40 cards was a tough sell at first, mostly because of how good Gearfried IS in the hand, but the exchange is having a higher % chance to see your one card starters without giving up interaction. You can search this with some of your main combos anyways, so it's not like you won't see it. Charles sees it at end of turn, and Ogier Renaud also adds it to hand.  Sublimation Knight summons Squeak Knight - a Fire Warrior way to start games. Better than that is Neo Space Connector and Aqua Dolphin, which does the same, but lets you trade a card to snipe a weak monster (like a hand trap) out of your opponent's hand. The only downside is that combo isn't fire, but it is well worth it, since it can force your opponent to use their hand traps early. Not perfect protection, since the card is Ashable, Veiler, Imperm, etc. Still good, especially in a deck already hand looping. Fire Flint Lady is the other extender - free extend, searchable off all the Rotas (Not straight through Heritage, but through Durendal through Heritage), cool bonus effect to trigger Ogier sometimes. Worth it as a one of, super free card. The other warrior Special Summons are just a LITTLE too situational to make the cut, but if you aren't running Imperm or other traps The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine might just make the cut. In a more Nibiru format (which we might see when Dragoon rage dies down) Imperm could be out, and we'd have an extra extender. I can't think of another warrior extender that is worth it.  The last engine in the deck is the Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon engine. Since we're 55 cards, you won't see your bricks as often as a smaller deck, and this really helps make the engine feel super free. It means a TRULY disrupted combo is one extend away from... Well... The best boss monster ever, I'm pretty sure. It also means you can follow-up without wasting too many extra deck slots. You aren't making this ON TOP of your board, EVER (Verte Anaconda and Auroradon are nonbos). But you're making it out of disruption reasonably often, and that makes the deck harder to disrupt properly.  There are 15 interactive cards, with one brick related to them. 9 Hand traps is actually lowish for a 55 card deck, but the other interactive cards are good in a lot of situations anyways. Gamma, Imperm, and Veiler give us good cards that hit on Zexal, Anaconda, and Halqifibrax, generic monster negates are almost always good, and these help ensure going second isn't a lost cause.  Triple Tactics Talent is mostly here to help with the hand snipe plan, it can be very disruptive if your opponent is running hand traps, and all of the effects are good. If you're going second it simply won't be dead, and if you're going first and it's dead you didn't need it. Called are also here to help with hand traps, but can be a good interruption going first, and even has strong applications going second. Wanting these cards on top of hand traps was another big reason for running more than 40 cards. We have hand traps, we are hard to hand trap, we have interaction, and we snipe hands almost by accident.  1 O-Lion and 1 Jet is fine. Sure, some combos need O-Lion in the deck (the biggest ones) but you CAN always combo off when you see O-lion, so I don't think it is worth it at all. I thought about Pot of Desires, but it left me, well, desiring. The deck is consistent enough without it, adding it warps deckbuilding decisions, and I'm unlucky with Desires banishes, so who needs em.  Side Deck was all about having 9 cards to bring in against Combo, and 9 cards to bring in against control. Evenly fulfills the role of board breaker and backrow remover together, Nibiru comes in over Called (Or Dragoon engine) vs combo, Forbidden Droplet can also come in. Since we're more than 40 cards, I needed easy to side in generic cards that I could run in multiples, so sidedeck is that.  Cut Impermanence for Ash Blossom. It's not quite as good as Imperm in this meta (Verta Anaconda dodges the effect very nicely) but this allows the deck to play Shade Brigandine for another warrior extender. I found my spell and trap zones clogged with equip spells, so being able to always activate Ash out of the hand is useful.  Sublimation Knight and Neo Space Connector are both 1 card Isoldes, which end on Auroradon + Savage + Charles, which is an Omni-negate, a pop, and a hand snipe (potentially 2 with Dolphin), and OTK damage on board. Add Oliver or Smoke Grenade to the combo, and you're getting an extra hand snipe off off Auroradon's ability. Add Renaud, and you can also get an extra hand snipe, by adding Smoke Grenade late, and popping Renaud and the Smoke Grenade. Any Isolde will go into this combo pretty easily.  Ogier + Renaud can send Gearfried, pick him up, make Ignoble Knight, equip Durandal, add Fire Flint Lady or Astolfo. It can then summon Gearfried and equip it with Ogier, Boom, Nibiru proof Combo. Since these combos use the Auroradon to search O-Lion you can't do this if O-Lion is in the deck (but between Dragoon and the normal combo, you'll still have options). Ogier + Durendal (or ROTA, Heritage) does the same thing without making Ignoble Knight.  Sub Knight or Neo Space Connector + Renaud is a five interaction board: You can use all of your resources, Halq, Linkross, Auroradon, Ignoble Knight, Jet and O-lion, most of your infernoble cards, and Phoenix Blade, and can end on Herald, Savage, Gearfried, and Charles. All told, that is 1 hand snipe, 1 pop, and 3 negates. Note that thanks to Phoenix Blade, you don't even really have to minus, since you can use Phoenix Blade to fuel Oliver and to pitch for Jet Synchron, meaning the combo also essentially searches you 2 follow-ups (usually a second Gearfried and your other 1 card Dragoon, but occasionally Renaud will take one of these spots, to recur Arfeudutyr vs backrow). This is the main way to see Herald of the Arc Light, but the deck can make it other ways. You can Living Fossil a Sublimation Knight, and recurr Jet Synchron, which will make the extra negate on some boards. If you have Sub Knight (not offa Isolde) and Flint Lady in your hand at the end of your combo, you can use Fire Flint Lady to Summon Sub Knight, then use Squeak Knights secondary ability to become a Tuner when you summon it, make Herald. Last summon! If you successfully combo off without using your Normal Summon, you can Normal Sub Knight for the extra Herald. If you combo off sans Normal, you might be able to use Aqua Dolphin or Neo Space Connector to search it plus Jet Synchron (or maybe Renaud or Oliver).  Divine Sword Phoenix Blade is slightly underwhelming, but it turns on Gearfried, and fuels the full combo. Linkuriboh means Jet Synchron can be a 1 Card starter that makes Dragoon, helping smooth out bricky hands by turning them into low-end plays. You could run Deskbot 001 to have Herald+Savage out of Jet, as well as freeer Herald + Savage out of Isolde. Not really worth it IMO, we're here to snipe hands, and you can still pull off Herald + Savage pretty easily without the extra brick. You can also go Herald + Savage off of just Gamma, but this burns important combo pieces. Still, it makes Gamma feel like more protection for your Rotas.  Other things I've snubbed include: 1) Extra Halqs. More Halq combos is good, and if makes it easier to comeback from disruption, but it's simply not essential. 2) Ravenous Croc. Draws cards + pop cards. Real problem in this deck is opportunity cost - any time you're making Croc you're making it instead of Charles, which in turn means you're trading potentially better protection and a better body (and a hand snipe going first) usually just to draw 1 card. 3) I've snubbed Trish. You can technically make Trish as a going second option, but I'd rather snipe hands deliberately going first. Charles and Dragoon both work to break boards - if I were to run any of these it would be Trish, over Linkuriboh. It would be trading some consistency for flexibility, and I'd rather be highly consistent, particularly since Charles and Auroradon help break boards going second anyways, as does Dragoon. Lastly, if you don't like fun you could run True King of All Calamities. I was more interested in that in the Librarian Synchro version of the deck, which could still do most of these combos, (sans one Anti-nibiru combo) but could also go +6 while making Calamities. In this version, the option feels redundant. Sure, sniping hands and then making Calamities is pretty good, but even in the version more dedicated to doing that it felt a little bad to turn 2 level 9s into one Calamites (especially deciding whether to give up a negate or a hand-snipe/pop.) One final, honorable mention is Nekroz of Clausolas. You can always add Sub Knight to your hand with Isolde, meaning if you see Clausolas you can search Nekroz Cycle and end on an extra Negate (it is also an extra generic Warrior effect monster you can sometimes special summon). The downside to this is that Nekroz Cycle is a complete and total brick, and that you might want to actually USE the monster you add with Isolde as a follow-up, and don't have a ton of excess level 3 monsters to make this play with. I could still see it as a Meta Call - it's a 2 card engine that takes the ceiling of the deck up to 4 negates a pop and a snipe (conveniently 6 interactions... one for each card in a going second starting hand!) I don't think it is really necessary however, and cards like Triple Tactics Talent and Effect Veiler might be stronger, are certainly more flexible and don't require bricks to run. A 1/1 line would mean you'd have the same odds of seeing your extra interruption as your brick, and then you have to shape your plays around 1 situational negate, instead of preparing follow-up plays and using the extra cards in your hand as other forms of extenders or interaction. Super Quantum Red Layer just seems bad. A lot of your combos require all of your zones to be free, and you can't really use it to extend out into Verte Anaconda when you want to. Sorry Power Ranger, you don't make the cut.  Going into Verta Anaconda and saving the combo is viable, as is saving Anaconda for follow-up plays. If you DO want to go Verte Anaconda turn 1, I'd advise going into Isolde first, in order to search a follow-up play - you have 2 for a reason. Shade Brigandine can't make Anaconda (normal monster), but at least you can summon it when you need it (plus, Isolde does make Anaconda anyways. It just doesn't run Isolde into Anaconda)."

I have made a few significant changes to the deck since I last posted here and it honestly feels just as good as it did when we still had three malicious. Without further ado lets get into the changes:  Ash in the main? -- I moved Ash from the side deck into the main taking out the pots and foolish. While the pots were nice for a while the hit to malicious meant that sometimes if your opponent interrupted you at the right time you couldn't use acquisitiveness. I could have just dropped that and replaced it with another avarice, but I decided to take all three cards out and put the most reliable hand trap into the main. I'm sure someone will say, ""Why not called by?"" Because that card doesn't do anything. No hand trap that I can called by really hurts, and if I really want the banish then i would play d.d. crow so its quick.  Adoration replaced by Escuridao -- MBT made a good point that sometimes you get stuck with destiny fusion and cant make sunriser. His solution was to not play miracle fusion and play adoration. I decided that was awful and was capping the power level of the deck pretty drastically. I decided to replace it with Escuridao because it is a super easy poly target if you are locked by destiny fusion, and its a second miracle fusion target that can be mask changed into dark law. So far it has worked very well for me.  Divine Wind??? -- This card is a really cool last-ditch effort card. Imagine you draw absolute trash and the Stratos gets ash blossomed, but you have a mask change in hand. Now you have something to do. You don't need to play blast because you have twin in the main and he's trash so. I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, THIS IS A LAST DITCH EFFORT. Pretty good against numeron too.  The Side Deck -- Quick rundown: 3x Dark Ruler; the no damage doesn't matter. Most of the time you can break a board and set up plasma dark law and stop their ability to rebuild. 3x Prohibition; If you opponent is playing Dino call UTC they have no outs I promise. UTC kills this deck because all your best monsters can be flipped facedown completely crushing your spirit. Also good for Nibiru if you know your opponent is playing it. 3x Evenly Matched; Same argument for Dark Ruler. 3x Lancea plays really well against a lot of decks. No Block Dragon, no Eldlich trap effects in grave, They cant dimension shifter you if that was something you were concerned about. I just really like the card and its not that bad right now. 2x Royal Decree. I played this in my last version and I stick to it. I dropped one copy for red reboot because im a man now. Absolutely brutal floodgate against some decks and it just wins games against some decks. Imagine red rebooting your opponent for 5 turns.

Base structuring. Plants. Counter Traps. ,"Made a bit of progression on my previous Rikka Deck. Card count is up to 50 from 45, but I've gotten it down to 42 with good ratios. This 50 card variant has been my bookmark/point of reference to go back whenever I scrap an idea.  Monster card selection is pretty established. I've re-re-re-submitted Evil Thorn back into the deck profile. I still do not like the low chance, random situation of drawing 2 or even all 3 copies of Evil Thorn. [Oh, it will never happen.] But it can, and it will, and it has.  Rikka cards are at bare minimal due to Evil Thorn. (Again, another reason I don't really want to use Evil Thorn.)  Rikka Petal, as my starter, has a 74%(@40 cards), 73%(@41c), 72%(@42c) , 71%(@43c), 70%(@44c). 44 being the largest size of the deck, I'm willing to settle for. Starting %'s do not factor in One for One. Just Rikka Petal, Glamour, Lonefire.  Spell and Trap cards are for control and countering. With this deck, I am very much, not scared to trade resources. Pollinosis has to be used for its spell speed and proccing tribute effects. I should be, ideally, triggering effects and re-arranging every turn; not just my turn. Strenna, ranking up. Kanzashi, GY stealing. Flurries, popping off.  Strenna role is to recur Rikka cards and then Pot of Avarice, is to recur all plants back into deck.  Field Spells are still an experiment... if doesn't pan out I can always replace those 7 or so cards with something more useful.  Once I can get a good base for the deck, I will add more meta-compliant, staple cards. Reason why my extra deck looks the way it does. I don't need anything distracting in it, while I work out the main deck core.  Deck surprisingly, and hilarious strong 1st turn setup against Dragoon.  edit: pulled Trap package. solid 42 card profile."

Hyper Librarian 1x Formula Synchron 1x Martial Metalmarcher 1x Borreload Savage Dragon 1x Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon 1x Coral Dragon 1x Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys 1x Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles 1x Herald of the Arc Light 1x Ignoble Knight of High Laudsallyn  So, here's the updated version of the Librarian combo build. Between Hyper Librarian, Coral Dragon, and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, you can draw an easy 5+ cards in a turn, while leaving Crocodragon, Captain Roland, and Hyper Librarian on the field. This might not sound like a highly disruptive field, but the idea is to use those 5 draws to find extenders, making an even bigger board. I'm running Coral Dragon over Stardust Charge for a few reasons - firstly, you always synchro it off when you're making it, so the downside of needing to leave the field after being Synchro Summoned is minimal. Also, it is always a Tuner, no Metalmarcher required, which actually helps make Charles + Crocodragon through certain combos. Furthermore, it can work in tandem with Charles, Roland, and Crocodragon to help break boards, since we can discard 1 to pop a card. That's a usuful advantage in a deck that is discarding to hand size more fo the time anyways. The deck has lots of other combos, and all the usual Infernoble stuff is here, with one notable exception.  Chaos Ruler is another spicy spicy pick - basically, when you're going to 2 rank 8s path, you almost always ended up synchroing (formerly) Dragite into Charles (Charles is the main boss monster of the deck). So, why not get a free mill 5, maybe find a Hand Trap, synchro it away into Charles, then res it (banishing Hyper Librarian and Linkross), thus being able to use it with a level 1 Tuner to Synchro Crocodragon? Even if you're short the Tuner, it's another big beatstick on the board that has to be dealt with, at the very least. The only other level 8 I could find that gives advantage is Genex Ally Axel, which is not generic, and would be worse if it was. Chaos Ruler is kind of unique in the way that it gains you immediate advantage as a Level 8 Synchro. The downside is that if you brick on your card draws it isn't a line of interaction, but this is a deck just chock full of Rotas and Level 1 extenders.  I can see why people run Super Quantum Red Layer, it makes the combo harder to interrupt for sure, and Tenyi Spirit type effects are always good. However, when we're drawing so many cards it is just a brick, and while its level isn't the worst, it certainly isn't good. Boost Warrior doesn't make full combo with as many cards, but it helps improve the combo by helping assure you make Roland before Halqifibrax (necessary to all the best combos out of the deck), and it isn't once per turn, so that's pretty cool when you see multiples. It is also searchable with Durandel, man Durandel is a strong card.  The deck is 50 cards. I literally have 40 cards I want to run main, + you need some interaction. Having said this, a 50 card deck with 7 1 card starters has better odds of seeing them than a 40 card deck with 4 starters. You have lower odds of seeing specific Infernoble cards in your starting hand, but you also don't really NEED specific cards, you just need to make Isolde. You'll draw into them ;)  For interactive cards, I'm only running 9, mostly because it feels correct to keep my odds of seeing cards reasonably high in such a heavy combo deck. Effect Veiler is really good right now - I'm running this over Imperm for several reasons, it's Light for Chaos Ruler, it's a Tuner for Halq combos, it's a level 1 meaning sometimes you can normal summon it to help combos, and you don't have to set it going first in order to use it (important, since often all of your Spell/Trap zones get used up by equips). Gamma is actually the best hand trap in the meta. Sure, it is kind of dead if we're going first (especially since you're liable to use most of your combo pieces in one turn), but generally speaking you need your hand traps more going second than first anyways, and Gamma is just high impact while still being generic. You can also add this with Chaos Ruler, and it might win you the game if your board gets broken. D.D. Crow and Ghost Ogre aren't dead in the meta, but Crow feels particularly weak right now, and Ghost Ogre is only really good some of the time. Nibiru is good, but a little specific with a several powerful control decks running around tier 1/2. For my final interactive cards, I'm running 3 Triple Tactics Talents. We're already pretty hard to properly hand trap, and Triple T makes us even hard to. The deck can snipe hands twice in one turn with Smoke Grenade of the Thief while setting up Savage + Charles + Auroradon. That's already really powerful, particularly since opponents need to see specific cards and answer in specific places to stop the combo most of the time. Sure, a bulk of hand traps might slow the game to a crawl, but then they also have to do something on board afterwards. Add to that Aqua Dolphin and the hand pressure is very real. Triple T is also not dead going second, since stealing a Monster is pure Beast Mode, and Draw 2 is always good.  I added One For One and Grappler Angler. One for One is another level 1 extender, which can be an extra copy of Renaud, super important, or can summon level 1 tuners or non-tuners for the purposes of the Draw 3 combo. Grappler Angler gives you a tuner One For One can summon after you've used Jet Synchron, and is an alternative to Renaud for when you used him or Durendal up making Isolde. It also summons Jet for games where you see O-Lion.  Combos  Combo #1 - Any Isolde = Level 9 + Savage + Auroradon  1 - Summon Isolde. Add Neo Space Connector. 2 - Send Durandel to the GY, summon Renaud 3 - Renaud effect, add Durendal to the hand 4 - Durendal effect, add Oliver to the hand 5 - Send Renaud to the GY , summon Oliver. 6 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens 7 - Link Renaud + Linkross into Halqifibrax. Summon O-Lion 8 - Synchro O-Lion with a token into Martial Metalmarcher. 9 - O-Lion effect, summon 1 token 10 - Metalmarcher Effect, summon Oliver 11 - Synchro Oliver + level 1 token into Captain Roland. 12 - Use machine token and Halqifibrax to link into Auroradon. 13 - Summon 3 Tokens 14 - Metalmarcher + a token synchro into Coral Dragon 15 - Coral Dragon + a token synchro summons into a level 9, and you draw 1 additional card. 16 - Roland + token synchros into Borreload Savage Dragon.  If you didn't brick out with equip spells, you can send 4 to the GY to summon Oliver that way (as a level 4), thus setting up the GY with Smoke Grenade of the Thief, and saving Renaud, Oliver, and Durendal for later. If you see a 1 card Isolde alongside either Oliver or Renaud, you can pick back up a Smoke Grenade of the Thief and use Auroradon in this combo to snipe an additional card out of hands. Same thing when you see Smoke Grenade. This is actually the low-end for the deck, but if you see O-Lion you're stuck using it with Halq instead of Jet, and also it is nice to be able to consistently end on this board if you need to - this is the combo that usually puts the fewest pieces onto the board, but unlike some of your other combos, you aren't reliant on card draws to really go off.  Combo #2 - Any Isolde = Draw 3 + Savage + Chaos Ruler  1 - Summon Isolde. Add Neo Space Connector 2 - Send 4 equips (incl Phoenix Blade) to the GY to summon Oliver 3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens 4 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Jet Synchron 5 - Link Jet Synchron + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens 6 - Auroradon effect, tributing itself and a token, summon O-Lion 7 - Synchro O-Lion + Token, summon T.G. Hyper Librarian. 8 - O-Lion effect, summon 1 token. 9 - Use Divine Sword Phoenix blade to banish warriors and add it to hand 10 - Jet Synchron effect, send Sword to the GY, summon Jet 11 - Synchro Jet + cyberse tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1 card 13 - Martial Metalmarcher effect, summon O-Lion. 14 - Synchro summon Synchron + token into Captain Roland, draw 1 card 15 - Synchro Roland + token into Borreload Savageraw 1 card, equip Auroradon to Savage. 16 - Synchro Chaos Ruler, draw 1 card, mill 5  This one is nice and spicy, a little card draw. But remember, thanks to Martial Metalmarcher, Chaos Ruler is a tuner right now. That means, you're 1 level 1 non-tuner extender away from making Charles, and since Chaos Ruler can res itself, you're in turn one level 1 tuner monster away from Savage + Ravenous Croc + Charles. And you've just gone +5 in the hand, and you didn't even have to discard - 1 card can draw you 5 cards while adding a card into your hand with Isolde. What is nice about this one, is that it doesn't matter if Oliver is a level 4 for this one, meaning you can do this entire combo exactly like the one above, for when you see your bricks, though without Smoke Grenade of the Thief Charles just isn't as good. One option is also to do it in reverse - make Chaos Ruler while you have Librarian on the field, and then use a Tuner to make Charles or Croc out of it, draw an extra card, or 2 in the case or Crocodragon. However, to res it your Librarian needs to be in the bin, so you can't actually get both level 9s before using the Librarian. Oh well. The mill 5 is a nice little advantage - you don't really always need it, but it is nice to put Ogiers and Olivers into the bin, and your hand traps are, notably, light attribute. Generally speaking, all of your bricks will be out of the deck before you make this card, so even though we aren't built to get huge advantage out of it, it still seems nice. The summon, on the other hand, is absurd for the purpose of Synchro climbing in this deck.  Combo #3 - Any Isolde = Draw 5, Charles + Ravenous Crocodragon  1 - Usual stuff. Isolde, Neo Space connector  2 - Send 4 equips, summon Oliver  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Oliver and Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Jet Synchron  5 - Link Jet Synchron and Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  6 - Auroradon effect, tribute itself and a token, summon O-Lion  7 - Synchro O-Lion + token into T.G. Hyper Librarian  8 - Use Divine Sword as fodder, summon Jet Synchron  9 - Synchro Jet Synchron + 2 tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1 card, summon Oliver  10 - Synchro Metalmarcher + 1 token into Coral Dragon, draw 1 card  11 - Synchro Coral Dragon + token into Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, 3 separate draw 1 effects  11 - Synchro Oliver + Librarian into Charles  Now, this one I quite like. Built this part of the combo yesterday and forgot it, so I've updated it now. This gives you some a really solid card draw option, and can pop three cards on the board. You're only going to be able to get one extra snipe off of it most of the time, because usually you see Smoke Bomb when you add it to the hand, but this could let you snipe three targeted cards from the hand, if you see it with Smoke bomb and either have or draw into Renaud (7 rotas helps), or two if you just see Renaud and send the Smoke Bomb. It also gives you extreme card advantage, and potentially a gigantic beatstick as well.  You might notice Roland isn't a part of this combo, and you may be thinking ""how do I get my pop""? You can make Roland in this combo, before you go into Needlefibre, if you have one extender, wheras it would be risky to attempt the draw 3 combo without both requisite extenders. Of course, sometimes that means choosing between, say, being Nibiru proof, hand looping twice, and making 3 negates. A good problem to have. Also, you can just make this going second to break boards while drawing cards.  Formula Synchron can be incorporated into either of the above combos to get even more card draw, (draw 7 plus 2 rank 9s, which is True King of All Calamities for warrior decks willing to run 4-5 equips) but it really is tough to say what to cut for it, particularly since it doesn't contribute to your board in any way, aside from the extra draw power. You're still easily drawing 5-6 with these combos, and 7 at the absolute most, and without discarding anything real thanks to Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade. One is better card draw, the other is a better board, or at least better odds of getting the complete board - the draw 3 should be your usual power move full combo, because it's almost always actually draw 5, Charles, Savage, Croc. The draw 5 comes in when you see Living Fossils or Fire Flint Lady on top of your combo, and/or a Renaud to get you living Fossil, because if you pull it off you could be drawing 7.  Combo #4 - Any Isolde = Charles + Savage, with space to make a monster first.  1 - Isolde adds Neo Space Connector  2 - Isolde summons Oliver  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Synchro Oliver + token into Roland  5 - Link Roland + Linkross into Needlefibre, summon O-Lion  6 - Synchro O-Lion + token into Martial Metalmarcher, O-Lion effect summons a token, Metalmarcher summons Roland  7 - Link token + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Martial Metal + token into Coral Dragon  9 - Synchro Coral Dragon + token into Charles, draw 1 card  10 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage.  This is just a mild deviation from the normal combo that results in the same board state, but uses 1 less monster zone, allowing you to, say, put up a Gearfried to protect against Nibiru  Combo #5 - Ogier + Durandel/Renaud = Anti-Nibiru combo  This one is pretty simple, summon Ogier, send Gearfried, activate Durandel, search Renaud, summon Renaud, add Gearfried, Link into Isolde, before you summon with Isolde banish Durandel to summon Gearfried, equip it with Ogier. From there, you can do the above combo as normal. You could make this combo with Renaud + Ogier as well, by making Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn.  Combo #6 - Neo-Space Connector (generic Isoldes) + Renaud = 3 Negates + Charles  #1 - Isolde adds a card, sends 4 eqips to summon Ogier  #2 - Ogier sends Gearfried  #3 - Summon Renaud, add Gearfried  #4 - Synchro Renaud + Ogier into Ignoble Knight of High Landsallyn, equip Durendal from the deck  #5 - Durendal effect, add Oliver  #6 - Use Phoenix Blade (banish Isolde + Renaud)  #7 - Send Phoenix Blade, summon Oliver  #8 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  #9 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Needlefibre, summon Jet Synchron  #10 - Synchro Jet + tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Oliver.  #11 - Synchro Oliver + Ignoble Knight into Charles  #12 - Link Metalmarcher + Halqifibrax into Auroradon  #13 - Auroradon effect, remove itself and a token, summon O-Lion  #14 - Synchro O-Lion + token into Roland, O-Lion effect replaces the token  #15 - Synchro Roland + token into Borreload Savage Dragon, equip Auroradon, 3 negates  #16 - Using Phoenic Blade to insulate yourself from the discard, summon Jet Synchron from the GY  #17 - Synchro Jet + token into Herald of the Arc Light  #18 - Summon Gearfried  Voila, 3 negates, a pop, and a hand loop. A good option to have in the deck, and the real reason to run Ignoble Knight of High Laudsallyn."

ARC-V anime and the true main antagonist of the series. Before his revelation, he is known as The Darkness or Black Shadow residing inside Yūya Sakaki and his dimensional counterparts. He is the original incarnation of Yūya Sakaki (Standard Dimension), Yūto (Xyz Dimension), Yūgo (Synchro Dimension), and Yūri (Fusion Dimension). Zarc's growing aggression led him to destroy the Original Dimension and take on a dragon form known as Supreme King Dragon Zarc. During his confrontation with Ray, Zarc's soul was split into four and reincarnated into four different lives. He is the original owner of the Four Heavenly Dragons and one of true co-creators of Pendulum Summon.  The Supreme King Deck in the anime doesn't have a really articulated play style by itself given its small membership but can work effectively as an engine. Using ""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"", the player is capable of toolboxing into the ""Supreme King Gates"", the archetype's main sources of a Pendulum Scale. Since both ""Supreme King Gate Zero"" and ""Supreme King Gate Infinity"" have Scale values of 0 and 13 respectively, they can potentially allow for monsters of any Level to be Pendulum Summoned, although ""Infinity"" carries a restriction of controlling no monsters in order to Pendulum Summon. So far, there is only one Ritual monster in the archetype, Demise, Supreme King of Armageddon which specializes in the destruction of every card on the field, inflicting 200 points of damage for each card destroyed that way.  Since they cannot do enough on their own given they have few members, the archetype is thus better mixed with other Pendulum cards to maximize the benefits. The ""Supreme King"" archetype pairs extremely well with the ""Magician"" archetype, especially ""Z-ARC Magician"" monsters.  For starters, most of them are DARK monsters so they cannot conflict with the Pendulum Effect of ""Darkwurm"". Secondly their Pendulum Scales have values of 1 and 8, which mix well with the ""Supreme King"" cards since ""Darkwurm"" is Level 4 and both ""Gates"" are Level 7. Thirdly these ""Magicians"" along with ""Chronograph Sorcerer"" are one of the ways to Special Summon ""Supreme King Z-ARC"", the archetype's boss monster. Additionally, the effect of ""Darkwurm"" to Special Summon itself from the Graveyard makes it a useful discard fodder for cards such as ""Pendulum Call"" as the player can instantly gather the means for a Pendulum Summon for no cost and their Pendulum Scales will go uninterrupted.  As a result of this mixture the ""Supreme King"" archetype is capable of more moves, involving greater flexibility in both Pendulum Summon and other Summon mechanics, being able to perform Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Summon.  For Fusions, both ""Zero"" and ""Infinity"" can provide some help since ""Zero"" can destroy itself along with ""Infinity"" to search for any ""Fusion"" card that can help conduct a Fusion Summon, some useful choices including ""Miracle Synchro Fusion"" and ""Odd-Eyes Fusion"". Given the Deck's mostly DARK nature, they can also Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" (and most other ""Predaplant"" Fusion monsters, and ""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"", if need be).  For Synchro Summoning purposes, ""White Wing Magician"" being a Level 4 can open possibilities for either Level 7, 8, or even Level 11 Synchro Summoning when paired with either a Level 3, 4, or 7. Since unlike other Tuner Pendulum Monsters, she has no restriction on what she can Summon (but using her after being Pendulum Summoned will banish her), she is an ideal Tuner for generic Synchro Monsters such as ""Red Dragon Archfiend"", ""PSY-Framelord Omega"" or ""Enlightenment Paladin"". If needed other monsters can be used too, such as ""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"", ""Timebreaker Magician"" or ""Noble Dragon Magician"" can open up room for Level 7 Synchro Summoning such as ""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"" or ""Black Rose Dragon"". Some of these cards can combo well with ""Miracle Synchro Fusion"" as well.  Finally, for Xyz Summoning, the archetype can gain easier access to either Rank 4 or Rank 7 monsters, ranging from utilitarian ones such as ""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"", ""Number 39: Utopia"", ""Number 104: Masquerade"" or ""Timestar Magician"" to the likes of ""Number 11: Big Eye"" or ""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"". ""Darkwurm"" is interesting due to its self-revival ability from the Graveyard which potentially mitigates some of the otherwise common and taxing cost of Pendulum-Xyz tactics. ""Number 39: Utopia"" can negate attacks to prevent your weaker monsters and this card from getting destroyed, while ""Number 104: Masquerade"" can be useful since its first effect sends one card on your opponent's deck to the Graveyard and its other effect can negate an opponent's monster effect and inflict damage to your opponent.  After dumping ""White Wing Magician"", ""Black Fang Magician"", ""Purple Poison Magician"", by detaching them and sending a ""Pendulum Dragon"" to the Graveyard by ""Foolish Burial"", they can then be banished for ""Z-ARC"".  For Pendulum Summoning, other additional and more mainstreamed cards such as ""Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"", ""Archfiend Eccentrick"" or ""Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon"". The former can search either of the ""Gates"" and many of the aforementioned ""Magicians"", while ""Eccentrick"" is an effective removal card. In other words, the ""Supreme King"" archetype is fairly flexible since they can be mixed with multiple cards and provide a handful of utilitarian uses.  As per the Master Rule 4, the deck loses its Pendulum Summon power. However, the player would often stand without Pendulum Summon as per the Pendulum Effect of ""Infinity"" thanks to the archetype's penchant for swarming and controlling the field through its ""boss"".  After swarming the Field with weaker monsters, the player can bring out ""Supreme King Dragon"" Extra Deck Monsters and use them to press the opponent. After your opponent gets rid of them and you managed to get ""Z-ARC"" on the field, you can use ""Supreme Rage"" to devastate, or even finish the opponent."

Maybe this is that?  We've got all of the HERO Rotas here, 1 original recipe ROTA, 1 A HERO Lives, and 3 Emergency Call. HEROs will play these forever, probably, not much to see.  Elemental HERO package is pretty standard, 3 Stratos, the archetype searcher/backrow clearer, 2 Shadow Mist, which searches Mask Change and when sent to the GY searches, 1 Solid Soldier, because it remains essential to combos involving E - Emergency Call, and 1 Honest Neos, a hand trap which is here to be searchable with Isolde. I cut Liquid Soldier. We don't need it to search Mask Change anymore, and we don't need it as a water type, with Grappler Angler and Halqifibrax as main combo pieces. The whole Vision Hero package is here - the idea is to summon these late into the turn, after making Synchro plays, to set up Fusion plays. They also put the requisite monsters on the board for Plasma. Malicious and Plasma are both still obligatory. Plasma is better than ever thanks to Roland buffing it's attacks, and the main combo puts 2 spell negates to go alongside the skill drain. No Evil Hero Package here - you could cut a Synchro monster to run a 1/1 line without impacting the deck much. I'd rather the choice between monster and spell negate. Space is tight.  I'm running 3 Neo Space Connector and 1 Aqua Dolphin. It baits out hand traps real good, and starts the deck's main combos, particularly helpful against Nibiru, which the deck can struggle against. Vyon is also sort of a one card starter, by sending Malicious (or in a pinch Shadow Mist to use Sunrise to get 2 warriors to start combos).  One of the main new additions is Fire Flint Lady, the ultimate extender for the deck. You must remember to time it before your Faris fires off, but being able to activate Shadow Mist or Stratos from the hand is amazing, and it's also the best ""free"" warrior extender. We're running 3 of Durendal, the Infernoble searcher, just to search it, though it doubles as Isolde fodder.  The rest are bricks and extenders.  Going first deck. It's devolved into an almost pure going first deck, despite the serious OTK potential involved, and I've cut all the hand traps and interaction. I made room for Sublimation Knight and Armageddon Knight, more one card starters, and trimmed Formula Synchron and Crystal wing from the extra deck to play Rainbow Neos (if you were smart this would be Dragoon, but I like the flavour and the card has serious applications vs Eldlich and for breaking boards. I added in Immortal Phoenix Gearfried - you can't use it to protect you from Nibiru, but it's a free extra negation at the end of your board, provided you combo off, and can make Isolde in rare situations. I added Phoenix Blade, to insulate the deck from the discard from Jet Synchron. I also added 3 Red Layer, as an easy extender to help ensure this bulkier deck still has really good odd of comboing off.  Combo is  1 - Any 2 Warriors into Isolde  2 - Isolde adds a card.  3 - Isolde sends Phoenix Blade to summon Grappler Angler  4 - Link Isolde into Linkross. Summon 2 tokens.  5 - Link Linkross into Needlefibre  6 - Summon Jet Synchron. Link into Auroradon. Summon 3 Tokens  7 - Tribute Auroradon and a Mecha Phantom Beast token to summon O-lion  8 - O-lion plus a level 3 makes T.G. Hyper Librarian. O-Lion effect summons another lvl 3.  9 - Banish 2 warriors from your GY, add Phoenix Blade to your hand.  10 - Send Phoenix Blade from your hand to the GY to summon Jet Synchron from the grave.  11 - Synchro Jet + Cyberse token into Formula Synchron. Draw 2.  12 - Synchro Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1, resummon Formula Synchron  13 - Synchro Summon Roland. Draw 1.  14 - Synchro Summon Savage. Draw 1.  15 - Synchro Summon second negate (whichever is more applicable).  You then use the cards in your hand to make HERO plays. Note that this is just a basic roadmap - Timing Fire Flint Lady in particular is much trickier. During the end Phase you can send a Durandel to the GY to add a Warrior (this is the preferred place to add Honest Neos)  The search for consistency and the growing desure to run lots of cards in HERO has resulted in the addition of more Noble Knights cards. These are relatively flexible Warrior extenders/combo pieces that give me better reason to run Charles and Gearfried. I initially intended to use Nobel Knight Bedwyr as a replacement for Sublimation Knight, a one card starter I could search off of Heritage of the Chalice, which could also search Durandel, and through that Fire Flint Lady. Basically it's just me reducing a very large deck to piles of cards I can use to search other cards. The thing is, the deck didn't miss the one card starter, ever, plus I never wanted to actually use Bedwetter, since it uses up Durandel and Fire Flint Lady. Ogier turns out to be a much better normal summon. Since the combo is pretty flexible, I decided I didn't need 2 of each brick - the combo with O-Lion in the hand is a little weak, but seeing it far from kills your plays, and in a 60 card deck you'll never see it. Living Fossil was added to the deck as a 4th equip, giving you more options out of Isolde, including Dark Law under Nibiru (love me some low ends), Oliver (when you see T.G. Striker), Ogier (to secure access to Gearfried), and Stratos to pop spells and traps and search any hero. It's also just a cool extender you can sometimes bin and then recover, and is just fine in the hand. T.G Striker may have a worse typing than Grappler Angler, but its effect is at least slightly better, being a free summon going second. The real reason it is here is because I'm covering bases, I often want to send both Smoke Grenade and Phoenix blade at the same time, and sometimes I draw an equip or 2. If you do see it, there are alternatives, such as sending Durendal to summon Renaud, add Durendal, add Oliver, bam, or summoning Oliver directly. if you didn't see the equips. Yes, you can and will sometimes brick out hard, but in general between all the searching, and the fact that your main combo draws 5-6 cards, you'll go through 30 cards in a turn easily.  Cut Astolfo, between banishing for Phoenix Blade and wanting to leave fire monsters in the GY it wasn't a useful extender for the deck. Added Arfeudutyr, which means you can still send for 4 when you see 1 non Durandel equip spell. As a result, I cut the little guy and replaced him with O-lion #2."

The ""Evols"" consists of Fire monsters, which simulate an evolution process. The smallest stage in form of the ""Evoltiles"" consists entirely of Reptile monster, who try to either summon the next higher step in the food chain or generate resources via their effects. The ""Evolsaurs"" are all Dinosaur monsters and are the weakest member of the ""Evol"" group, because all of their monsters have no effect unless they enter the field via an effect of an ""Evoltile"" monster. This alone would not have to be a weakness, but their effects are certainly letting them down. The ""Evolzars"", however, are making up for that by being pretty powerful Dragon Xyz monsters which all manner of negate effects.</p> <p>For the playstarters, I have ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"", who summons an ""Evolsaur"" monster when tributed. By using ""<a data-name=""Evo-Force"">Evo-Force</a>"" on ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"", you gain two Level 4 ""Evolsaurs"" which then can be used immediately to summon a Rank 4 Xyz monster of your choice. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a>"" is there for some cheeky plays in the opposing turn and ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"" qualifies as ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"" fodder since it is a Reptile and therefore a non-Dinosaur monster. ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" generates less resources when used with ""<a data-name=""Evo-Force"">Evo-Force</a>"", but has its own effect to fetch a monster. Also, the effect of re-fueling one of your Xyz monsters is pretty insane and allows the already powerful ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" to negate even more plays the opponent tries to pull off. On the Dinosaur side of things, you have the trusty ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"", who can either fetch necessary cards or delivers graveyard setup.</p> <p>On the ""Evolsaur"" front, I have added two ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Cerato"">Evolsaur Cerato</a>"", since it becomes a 2100 ATK beater quite regularly while also being able to search for further ""Evoltiles"" when destroying monsters in battle. One ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Diplo"">Evolsaur Diplo</a>"" gives you another option of backrow removal in the Main Deck while one ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Vulcano"">Evolsaur Vulcano</a>"" is there for potential revive plays. Further revival can be found in ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"", who also works as a protective option while in your hand. The Main Deck boss monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"" are very useful in both beatdown and stun boards and are also easily summonable via ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"". While ""<a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus</a>"" potentially fetches further ""<a data-name=""Evolution Pills"">Evolution Pills</a>"", they can also be searched by the copies of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"". The ""<a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a>""/""<a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a>"" combo is simply there to give you more consistency for Xyz summons.</p> <p>With ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Evo-Diversity"">Evo-Diversity</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" (alongside the previously mentioned ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>""), there are a few options that help you search for cards and increase the overall consistency. Some Control-/Stun-oriented options are ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"", a personal favorite of mine which lowers the ATK of Special summoned monsters and negates their effects, a few ""Solemns"" to disrupt the opposing plays, ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" for more backrow removal and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" to disrupt opposing searches. ""<a data-name=""Evo-Singularity"">Evo-Singularity</a>"" is an absolute wonder if you have enough monsters to trigger the card and in all honesty who does not want to have multiple negates via ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" which you can then potentially refresh via ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>""?</p> <p>Since the two copies of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"" are not exactly budget-friendly, I would suggest leaving them out and instead fitting an additional copy of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" to fill the deck space if the budget is of concern.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is pretty straightforward: One copy of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" (which can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Evo-Singularity"">Evo-Singularity</a>""), one of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Dolkka"">Evolzar Dolkka</a>"" and three of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" are not bad cards, but I find myself going into ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" way more often than into the other two. The rest really just consists of options for various situations: ""<a data-name=""Pentestag"">Pentestag</a>"" can potentially kill the opponent in combination with ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"", since you can deal more piercing damage than burn, ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" gets rid of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaurs"">Animadorned Archosaurs</a>"" that you are not able to use for summons otherwise, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" are more backrow removal (""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" with two Level 4 monsters and no further cost, while ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" can also use ""Evoltiles"" or ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"" but asks for a card in your hand as additional cost), and ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" if you really need to have a ""Evoltile"" in hand (for example if you desperately need a non-Dinosaur monster for ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"").</p> <p>I personally like the theme of ""Evol"" and could see them being rather good with some more support. However, this current decklist is as far as I managed to get with them in deckbuilding terms. Due to generic Dinosaur support being so powerful, this deck has heavy contenders in form of ""Dino Rabbit"" or ""True King Dinos"" and I would say that both those options are probably stronger than an ""Evol-""-centered build. However, if you want to give the ""Evols"" a spin, feel free to use this list as inspiration. Also, if you are further interested in the ""Evol"" group of archetypes, I would like to invite you to my blog and take a look at the archetype analysis for the ""Evols"" here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/archetype-analysis-evol/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/archetype-analysis-evol/</a></p>"

Save a buck. ,"Super budget approach for a base build of Generaiders. Was throwing together this deck for my nephew and thought this was actually pretty damn good and worth a share.  There are a few pricey cards in here, outside the short printed Generaider cards. Nothing too unreasonable. For example, Condemned Witch. That card itself sits between $5-8 and plays well with Lotpr and Trias. And can fetch your Forbidden Chalice and Lances that can be found in your Structure decks and $1 spare boxes. Maybe later, you can fetch yourself 3 copies of Forbidden Droplets.  World Legacy Monstrosity is pretty cheap steal now with recently getting a reprint(alongside a rarity bump).  Kuji-Kiri Curse, another great card. Might run you a $2. Currently $0.50 to $1.  Ash Blossom(~$11) and Called by the Grave(~$6) are bit pricey as single sells. But you can, and don't know why wouldn't have already done it, get these from the Duel Devastator box. I recommend snagging these from a local store and not online. Save yourself $10-$15. Or... side in some other options.  Phantom Fortress. $1 card.  True King of soon to be, and most likely won't be banned, is a less than $2 option boss.  Nine-Lives Cat is a $0.10 option, that plays well with your Hela and helps loop GY resources from your side and opponents.  Finally, the unfavorable, Purple Trishula. A good $2 optional card, that looks pretty. Helps keep the board tidy with an effect that can be annoying to your opponent.  The overall pricing for this deck sits at about $160. Which sounds like a lot but alot of the pricing comes from Ash Blossom, Called by the Grave, 2 short printed Generaider cards and some of the other non-Generaider card's.  If you're tracking these cards sensibly. You can easily snag these card for barely a headache or pinch to your wallet."

Their restriction doesn't even affect Puppy-Kalantosa play. But, Obedience Scho","No, we wont use the Evil Twin engine for Melffy of the Forest, as the payout for it is super weak, but we still can tho lol. We use the engine for card advantage and interruption with the Kisikil Lilla extra deck monsters. Start with Live Twin monster, make Evil Twin Kisikil, revive Live Twin, make Evil Twin Lilla, revive Evil Twin Kisikil for draw, make Evil Twin Kisikil again so we can summon Evil Twin Lilla during opponent's turn for free pop. Turn 3 we can trigger both the draw and pop. If we have Puppy in hand, we can summon it during the end phase. Monster Reborn allows us to link climb for Unchained Abomination because it re-summon Evil Twin Kisikil.  <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> combo is what we do to utilize Melffy the best. By summoning <strong>Melffy+Kalantosa+random</strong> (the random can be another Melffy, since we only run small pool of beast) will have 2 interruptions right away. If we draw Kalantosa, we have to summon Fenny instead of Puppy. Make Melffy of the Forest using Melffy + random, use Forest detach Melffy add Melffy Tag, use Tag ss Melffy, make Excited Melffy. During opponent's turn, we can use Excited to re-summon Melffy and Kalantosa, making us can trigger 2 Kalantosa.  Main Deck: Evil Twin engine, 12 starters (3 Kisikil, 3 Lilla, 3 Entrance, 3 Cynet Mining). 3 Melffy Puppy (best Melffy, 3 because you wanna see it the most together with Evil Twin engine), 1 Fenny (for Obedience Schooled play), 1 Tag (combo piece, extender), Hide-and-Seek (protection and recursion, because we play control). 2 Kalantosa (Melffy partner in crime, 2 because you can trigger both) and 1 Valerifawn (can re-summon Kalantosa and triggering it, also as extender for follow-up). 3 Obedience Schooled (best Melffy starter lol). Monster Reborn for link climb/xyz material. The rest is just staple.  Extra Deck: 3 Kisikil and 3 Lilla (play the most copies as spare). 2 Forest (generic, gives plus) and 1 Excited (combo piece, also allows Negalogia play). Unchained Abomination and Knightmares are just generic good fiend extra deck monsters. Sky Cavalry Centaurea (great rank 2 xyz with non-target, non-destruction removal, and allows Negalogia play) and last but not least, Negalogia (wipe boards).  &nbsp;  Pros: Super consistent in putting 2 interruptions, big staples.  Cons: Low atk problem.  Cards to think of: Melfy Catty + Hop Ear Squadron (Catty returns to hand to add Hop Ear, it means Catty-Hop Ear cant work by themselves, so I cut it), Nimble Beaver or other rank 2 engine (good but as I stated Melffy of the Forest turbo is weak after testing), Tribrigade (eats resource too much and requires beast discard, we don't wanna discard our Melffy), Melffy Playhouse (possible multiple interruption, but is a win-more because Puppy and Obedience Schooled already do the same), other Melffy monsters (don't do much as Puppy/Fenny)."

I have focused this deck around the same basic combos (vyon, send shadow mist to the graveyard, etc) but have also added some defenses. The ability to use super poly, the hand traps and normal traps make for some okay counters to whatever your opponent is doing, and the use of fusion recovery helps when you are a few turns in and have exhausted most of your monsters. We have 3 copies of stratos for is functionality and for summoning divine wind with mask change. We also use bubbleman and ocean to get out masked hero acid or absolute zero, two fantastic cards. The ability to get out big damage monsters with E HEROES and the great effects of the MASKED HEROES combo very well together.

These effects not only allow recycling for returning cards to the deck if not also because they allow to use the effect of a card more than once per turn if it was set in the area of ​​magic and traps, activate its effect, touch the graveyard and when it is there it can be used once again, being able to deny for example the effect of two different monsters, or destroy two and more. With all this, the deck has a fairly powerful disruption in the opponent's field so, along with its multiple interruptions to the plays of our opponent, we can bet on damage in our turns, which is not bad for the deck. thanks to bidders such as Morningstar, Nasten, Tezcatlipoca, Superbia, Zerato and even Ixchel herself, since their attack values ​​do not go below 2500 and they all provide very good effects and are important to the deck.  &nbsp;  Deck demostration: <a class=""style-scope ytcp-video-info"" href=""https://youtu.be/IfXj3PtkkM4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/IfXj3PtkkM4</a>"
