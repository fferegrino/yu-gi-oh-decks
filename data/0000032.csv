A fun deck that can stand up to the meta and hold its own.,"The main strategy of the deck is the basic Dark magician combos. however Magician Of Chaos adds in a more offensive Ability. I have Teched in Dark Magician Girl with  Dark Burning Magic because of the fact dark magicians have a built in Raigeki and Harpies Feather Duster in one card. However if you wanted, You could remove those two and the deck would function completely fine without it, The main deck count With DMG and Dark Burning Magic is a 42 card deck.  Other useful cards for the deck would be another Dark Magic Veil in place of Monster Reborn. I went with a M.R at the moment because of the fact it can revive any monster I need. but it can also disrupt my opponents plays if need. If you wanted to play a more casual set up, then you could swap out the 2 copies Infinite Impermenace and Called By The Grave for Thousand Knives or Dark Magic Expanded. Other Cards worth of note that i prefer to use are the Mirror Forces and Solemn brigades."

(ex) if you start with a poly and any two prank kids you can pretty much win ever game. poly into rocket get your 2 and pop rocket for the 2 you used. then summon dodo doodle do with 1 of the pks you havent grabbed. always remember red grabs bleue blue grab green and only grab rocksies if you have floater cards in the hand. dodo searches panedmonium the go into bow wow then pop dodo for pandamonium and a red green or blue set pandemonium and wait for opponent standby or when they activate in main phase to get out battle buttler and 3 more prank kids. lots of extenders and draws andcan borreload or borrelsword very easy if you can use poly over pandemonium but as long as you bring out borrelsword/load first you can combo off even with pandemonium haha and chain strike is super easy to pull of 2 to 3 k damage for free and when you pop a flame and drop 1st turn and in there main phase 1 thats an almost 5 to6 k lp difference .  &nbsp;  you have to remember that your cards being popped in the standby phase means you cant chain things like prank kids pandemonium and i think maybe adding in mask of restrict to the sidedeck because kaijus and lava golems straight wreeeeeeck this deck hahah nothin worse than opening borreload beast butler 1st turn and getting lava golemed (happened yesterday haha)

This is a mix of archetypes to allow for Crystal Wing summoning and includes the full,"This deck is designed to allow for easy, consistent Crystal Wings while reviving the use of the Gusto Archetype. This deck also allows you to use the Gusto's original OTK monster Sphreez with the LP dealt to your opponent.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE: This deck is not meant to be a top meta deck, but is a deck which is meant to bring back an old archetype into a level of play which is able to do decently in the current MR4 format. This deck is purely for fun play and for reference for older players who miss the archetype. The guide below is to show some of the useful bits of this deck for new players.</strong>  This deck has multiple ways to summon Crystal Wing that even now I'm still counting them. A few examples are: <em>In the following Examples, <strong>SS</strong> will be used to denote Special Summon, and <strong>NS</strong> will be used to denote Normal Summon.</em>  <strong>Windwitch - Ice Bell</strong> <em>1) SS Windwitch - Ice Bell and Windwitch - Glass Bell using Ice Bell's Effect. Burn for 500DMG with Ice Bell's effect and add Windwitch - Snow Bell to hand using Glass Bell's effect in chain.</em> <em>2) When you have 2+ Wind monsters on the field and no other elements, you can SS Windwitch - Snow Bell from hand.</em> <em>3) Synchro Summon:</em> <em>~ Ice Bell + Glass Bell = Windwitch - Winter Bell / Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</em> <em>~ Winter Bell / Clear Wing + Snow Bell = Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em>  <strong>Speedroid Terrortop + Windwitch - Snow Bell</strong><span><strong> </strong></span><em>1) SS Speedroid Terrortop, and using its effect, add Speedroid Taketomborg to your hand.</em> <em>2) As you control a Wind monster, SS Speedroid Taketomborg from your hand.</em> <em>3) Activate Taketomborg to tribute itself and summon Red-Eyed Dice, with Red-Eyed Dice on summon; change Terrortop's level to 6.</em> <em>4) SS Windwitch - Snow Bell as you currently control 2 Wind Monsters</em> <em>5) Synchro Summon</em> <em>~ Red-Eyed Dice + Terrortop (now lv.6) = Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</em> <em>~ Clear Wing Synchro Dragon + Snow Bell = Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em>  <strong>Speedroid Terrortop + Gusto Egul </strong><em>Same steps as with Snow Bell up to Step 4, however instead of SS Snow Bell, you still have your NS for Egul.</em>  <strong>Speedroid Taketomborg + Windwitch - Glass Bell</strong> <em>1) NS Glass Bell and add Windwitch - Snow Bell to hand</em> <em>2) SS Taketomborg, then SS Snow Bell</em> <em>3) Same Synchro as Windwitch Engine</em>  <span>CARDS OF NOTE:</span>  <strong>Pilica, Descendant of Gusto </strong>Often missed is that Pilica is not Archetype specific and is able to summon back ANY wind Tuner from your graveyard, though their effects are negated and they must be put in Defence mode. This aids with not only making their own Gusto monsters, but also allows you to summon back the Windwitch tuners, eg: Glass Bell can be brought back to make Clear Wing, and you can still summon Taketomborg or Snow Bell from hand to add the 1* monster to make the Crystal Wing. Also, as Pilica is a level 3 Psychic monster, she can also be special summoned using Emergency Teleport. Pilica can also help with disruption, an example: If your opponent Ghost Ogre's your Winter Bell / Glass Bell / Ice Bell while using the Windwitch combo, you can summon Pilica both as a non-Tuner 3 star and to summon back the 4 star Glass Bell. If Glass Bell is negated, you can also use Pilica to bring a Snow Bell back from the GY.  <strong>Gusto Defence Engine</strong> Those who know about Gusto's probably already know this strategy, but for new players let me explain in brief: <em>Gusto Gulldo (When destroyed by battle / card effect and sent to GY) - Special Summon a level 2 or lower Gusto from deck. (Winda or Egul)</em> <em>Winda, Priestess of Gusto (When destroyed by opponents attacking monster and sent to GY) - Special Summon a Gusto Tuner from deck. (Gulldo or Egul)</em> <em>Gusto Egul (When destroyed by battle and sent to GY) - Special Summon a level 4 or lower non-Tuner Gusto from deck. (Winda or Pilica)</em> This can obviously be used as a defence, however this is both a trap and an offensive strategy. So what's the aim of this? Because of the pattern of summons, it is possible to dictate which monster your opponent destroys last. In this case, we can make sure that the last attacked monster is Gusto Egul. Why? When Egul is destroyed we can summon Pilica from deck, who can then summon back a Wind Tuner, eg: Gusto Gulldo. Then in our turn, we can Synchro Summon Daigusto Sphreez and add Gulldo to our hand. We can then summon Gulldo to attack our opponent's monster with them taking all the damage.  <strong>Daigusto Sphreez</strong> Probably one of the main powerhouses of the Gusto, but don't let her low 2000atk for a 6* monster deceive you, Sphreez has a rather evil set of effects. The first effect you will notice is that she can not be destroyed by battle, if you summon her using Snow Bell, you can make her not able to be destroyed by Card effects either, so she is basically an indestructable monster (don't forget, this only applied to battle and for effects that say ""destroy""). Next, we have her effect on Synchro Summon to add a Gusto back from the graveyard to your hand. This allows you to add Pilica (if you have used your NS) so you can make a Sphreez again next turn if you lose her. OR she can be used to add Gulldo to your hand to be NS for attacking. Though both of these abilities are useful, the most important ability is her passive ability effecting all Gusto's. While Sphreez is on the field, all Battle Damage you would take from a battle involving a Gusto Monster you control, is instead dealt to your opponent. When we include the Gusto Defence Engine mechanic listed above this one, this means against a 3000atk monster, we can deal a total of 8300dmg in one turn, and still have Sphreez standing on the field.  <strong>Super Team Buddy Force Unite!</strong> This is actually very useful in this deck for all of its effects, however it is mostly its summon from the Graveyard that helps this deck with increasing the number of synchro monsters or Sphreez damage. A good example of how this card can help is when making another Crystal Wing after your first one was sent to the graveyard. For ease, we will use the example of making a Crystal Wing from Windwitch. After making the Clear Wing for the 7 star, you can target Clear Wing to summon Crystal Wing back from the graveyard and then proceed to synchro summon your second Crystal Wing. This can also be used to help with issues related to interuption as you can also use the card to summon monsters from your hand.  <strong>Gozen Match</strong> Probably the most obvious card for this deck due to the name I have dubbed it. This deck deals purely with Wind attribute monsters, meaning that Gozen Match is a good card to restrict your opponent with no effect on yourself. Also, as a lot of the monsters effect conditions then limit you to Wind Monsters after their use, you almost never have to worry about this.  <span>WEAKNESSES:</span>  Obviously as this deck is not meant as a top competition deck, this deck has quite a few weaknesses. The biggest weakness is that the deck relies heavily on Special Summoning, so turning off the Special Summons with cards like Vanity's Fiend is in most cases fatal.  As this deck relies like a lot of old style decks on having a big boss monster (no matter how powerful he may be), cards such as Widow Anchor and Kaiju's can be a problem. Though Gozen Match is one way to try and counter this issue.  This deck does not rely on link monsters, which in turn makes it a little slow at getting monsters on the field.  Crystal Wing only has a single negate, so you need to time your negate correctly.  <span>OTHER INFORMATION:</span> This deck has many different combos and part of the fun is finding these as the deck can keep summoning monsters constantly so there are many different ways to summon the different synchro monsters. The deck profile provided is for current TCG as of 09/08/2019.  <em>Edit: - Update deck to include new cards </em><em>- Update side deck</em>"

All credits go to the inventor of this strategy whose name I forgot... But I do put the deck together myself and make it somewhat consistent.  The main goal of this deck is to pull off this combo:  1. Have reborn Tengu and red resonator or a self-ss tuner at your starting hand.  2. NS red res to ss tengu or ss a tuner and ns tengu.  3. Link into needlefiber to ss bulb from hand or deck. Tengu ss another Tengu.  4. sync blub and tengu into T.G. librarian. Tengu ss another Tengu.  5. Revive bulb and sync another T.G. librarian to draw 1. Then end turn.  6. Start of oppo main, banish needle to ss format sychron, format draw 1 and T.G. draw 2.  7. Chain to draw effect and sync into quasar/blazar or whatever lvl 12 boss synchro u like. I recommend blazar as it free up the extra zone for future plays.  8. End board: quasar/blazer and 4 card you draw.  That's the main combo for turn 1, then you can link spam into skull dread and two borreload with all the token generating tuners.  Some key cards explained:  Instant fusion: To get the free tuner from Ed.  Fire format : Search Tengu.  Brilliant Engine: To help bricked hands if you cannot ss a tuner or having trouble to get 2 rank 4. Also additional fusion spell can be used latter for discard fodder of summoner monk.  Performages: free rank 4s as they're not HOPT. Help if you can't get Tengu.  Note that this deck is extremely vulnerable to hand traps, a well timed ash or impermanence can break your combo so it mostly likely cannot compete with meta decks. However it's fun if u like summon a boss and link spamming. Also there's no recovery if you get sphere moded and/or dark hole/ragekied.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I'll explain all the cards and why they're there and the strategy, because I have time and why not.  First, you have the 5 Exodia pieces, they're are what you need in your hand to win...duh, there isn't another way you're gonna win with this deck.  2 The Legendary Exodia Incarnate. This card serves many purposes. First, combined with Obliterate, you can get pieces to your hand easily. It isn't affected by card effects so it won't return to your hand, and once you end your turn, you can get a piece back into your hand. Basically summon him, Obliterate him, mill a piece, bring that piece into your hand. It's also a meat shield, well not really with 0 def, but it can be used to defend against an attack. Once it is destroyed by battle though, you can show your opponent how close they are to losing and draw the same number of pieces you showed them. I only have 2, because you don't need more and 3 can cause a bit of clogging.  2 Ra Sphere Mode, basically a pumped up Kaiju, that can also be a meat shield, if you get it back. You tribute 3 (F...ing 3) of your opponent's monsters and they get this ball they maybe able to sacrifice, although your opponent needs to have 3 monsters to summon this. If they find no use for it, you get it back, and it just sits there like a shield. I don't run Winged Dragon of Ra, because Exodia is one and only true GOD.  3 Battle Faders and 3 Swift Scarecrows, basically just used to stall, and make sure your opponent's attacks don't go through.  3 Cardcar D's, use them to draw, they won't stay on the field, so they don't stop your battle phase stalls or take an attack, lowering your LP.  3 Pots of Duality, you can use them to bring anything you need to your hand whether that be to draw more, stall, or bring a piece into your hand.  1 Upstart Goblin and 1  One Day of Peace, extra draw power, Your opponent's LP don't matter, all that matters is getting the pieces or one step closer to them so that extra 1k LP you gave doesn't matter if they'll just get OBLITERATED by Exodia. 1 DOP gives you an extra turn where you don't take damage, so extra stall power. You won't attack so your opponent really gains no edge at all.  3 Dark Factories, this is in case you have the vanilla pieces in the GY (Arms &amp; Legs), you can get them back into your hand at a fast pace, bringing back 2 pieces into your hand, downside, you need 2 pieces in the grave, can't just bring back one.  1 Hand of Destruction, it gets rid of 2 of your opponent's cards which might ruin a combo they have planned, but it could help them...cough cough Dark World cough...(Old example) or it could let them draw into something they want/need. I use it as extra draw power especially if I have 2 exodia vanillas as well as a Dark Factory.  Next, the classic Raigeki, if it can go off, basically wipes your opponent's field of monsters.  I have an insurance policy called Pot of Acquisitiveness, this is in case your opponent banishes a piece, or 2, or 3. If they banish less than 3, just bring back battle faders as well to continue stall, although you'd be a bit slowed down since your deck is bigger, but it's better than having a piece banished meaning you can't win.  The last spell, Magic Planter, this is used as draw power, while also getting rid of one of your continuous traps, Obliterate or Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light. If you haven't activated Obliterate's 1st effect and you don't need it, send it to GY, draw 2, get a piece back or an Incarnate from the GY into your hand. Or Send Swords, so if your opponent decides to Atk directly, banish it, basically ending the battle phase.  Now the traps, 3 OBLITERATES!!! basically you can send a monster back to the hand, yours (ie Incarnate...although it won't lol, or something else idk) or your opponents, annoying them and making them summon that back oof, wasting their effort and resources. Then send a piece of Exodia or Incarnate (people who send Incarnate are weird). Combining this with the effects of Incarnate or Dark Factory, getting to Exodia becomes a lot quicker.  Next 3 Threatening Roars and a Waboku, these are more stalls, you can use them in any number variant, (ie 2 TR, 2 Waboku), I prefer TR, because it prevents them from atking, monsters aren't targeted, some effects that go off because they battled or attacked can't be activated (ie Timelords...that duel took forever) so for me,  3 TR, 1 Waboku.  Lastly, 2 Heavy Dust Storm, it gets rid of up to 2 of your opponent's spells/traps or <em>yours </em>(ie Swords or Obliterate so you can use their 2nd effects, just like how magic planter sends them to GY). You won't atk your opponent anyway, so its drawback doesn't matter. It's like Twin Twister, but you don't need to discard, and is perfect for this deck.  THIS DECK MUST BE 40 CARDS, 40!!! This is to ensure no clogging and getting pieces and other cards you need/want faster and more probable. Also people who use deck with more suck and show rethink their lives.  Extra Deck  3 Number 63's. In case you have a battle fader, and you want to get rid of a piece/SS to use Dark or Exodia Incarnate, etc, go into 63 and use it's draw effect. More draw power, sets up GY at times for cards listed above, and puts your on field lv 1's to use.  I have 1 Number 81, in case you have a Ra and an Exodia Incarnate you don't need, go into this. At 3.2K ATK/ 4K DEF, it is a big meat shield, and its effects makes sure it can't be affected by other card effects, forcing your opponent to basically destroy it by battle.  Other cards I have include Skypalace Gang and Superdreadnought, basically damage your opponent or destroy an opponent's card (Sky). Or it can just be a meat shield, IDK, you decide how to use it if you choose to."

Well your wrong. Spyral is just as powerful and after making deck from scratch oh boy is Spyral insane. This deck is definitely a going first deck. You always to go first whenever possible and just link spam your opponent. The Sky Striker engine is a small part of the deck to be able to get <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster"">Sky Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster</a> and use it to protect your <a data-name=""SPYRAL Double Helix"">SPYRAL Double Helix</a> since it will be the only monster on the field after using two Spyral monsters to summon it. It acts as 5 more copies of <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> since you can add Eagle Booster off Engage. Theres just way too many combos with this deck to explain. A really cool combo I love doing though is getting out <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> after using Double Helix to get out <a data-name=""SPYRAL Master Plan"">SPYRAL Master Plan</a> and sending a <a data-name=""SPYRAL MISSION - Rescue"">SPYRAL MISSION - Rescue</a> from your hand to grave to send back <a data-name=""SPYRAL Resort"">SPYRAL Resort</a> from your field to deck that way you can use the Rescue to special summon back Master Plan and link her off to use her effect and get back Resort plus another Spyral monster which is insane. Sometimes I have found myself getting so much plus on the first turn that I don't know what to do with it all while play testing. This deck almost never bricks too! I love it. This is just one of those decks you have to figure out the combos yourself since there are just so many ways to destroy your opponent going first after using Double Helix's effect to special summon Master Plan. Enjoy and I hope everyone has a happy new year!"

Use Electrumite to send Madonna to the extra deck then, destroy Wild Hope in your pendulum zone to add Madonna to your hand and activate Wild Hope's effect to search and draw with Electrumite, then you can search again with Madonna. It's one of the better strategies with the deck."

Necrovalley is sometimes best when opponents keep using the graveyard as we know a shuffled tower into the deck is annoying but necrovalley can help loads so if you have terraform use judgement get the valley.  &nbsp;  !!!!mistake and iron wall!!! can hurt or help you if iron wall is up drop gama on the opponents side as the wall is stoping the effect or if mistake is up tower is useless to pull cards but kaiju effects can still be used but with necrovalley and skill-drain and remove brain washing this creates the ultimate defense as your opponent cannot play ....this is also the time for a kaiju army.  SANDAION is the master of the deck as skill drain and the Doctor as i like to call him is usually a fun combo but the doctor can be destroyed in this state as his effect is gone but you now have a one turn 4k killer.  With out skill drain look to getting Gama with tower up in a special summon shootout:  1 ss Raiden or Star d kaiju to opponent  2DR.who to your side  3SS gama to your side. the doctor kills the stronger kaiju then gama is free to pull points  a dark hole and a time lord goes a long way so drop it like its hot &amp; this is also fun with the slumber  Zaphion is preferred choice in a time maiden pull on first turns you will often find it is easy to kill a Timelord via negating effects but she has a great death present for you Celestial transformation lets you special summon them from the hand but they do not die as a result of the card but be warned this card can leave you without monsters in the hand if tower is not up Zaphion and advance draw is fun for a triple draw but i like to keep her for the back row issues  Honest is fun but he can be replaced with any card you like but he has helped me win many a duels ... but he can go....and you know what he did I have two easy replacements for him and i am currently running with x3 cat of ill omen it just makes moving into the stages easier the other replacement is battle fader as he is able to stop  a battle phase  updated I added the field spell mining cave to further annoy the opposition and remain in complete control never use this card first it is a near the end of the duel card like evenly matched its to get complete control of the game  replaced dark hole with interrupted kaiju the cave gives more control and added honest fader with cat of ill omen just to mix it up  *the spell mining cave spell has a draw back you must have less monsters than the opponent...and never the same amount as the opponent*  so many combos and regrouping you can do to get control of the game another dreadnaut monster was added to be a finishing blow nothing more do not use the big guy unless you are able to remove brain washing or spell mining cave BEFORE his summoning people love to take him from you  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

However, the core of the deck is inconsistent, so we have to add some engines into it to make it more reliable.  In this deck I use the SpellBook engine and the WindWitch engine. I do use the most recommended ratios ( 1-2-2 and 3-2-1 respectively).  Now, what you would like to prioritize is getting the DM combo started with Dark Magical Circle with either Eternal Soul or Magician Navigation while having a Dark Magician in hand. If you are missing something, go with Magicians Rod and you will be fine. However, sometimes, you only open with the Rod without anything else, that is when the engines come into play. The Windwitch engine is the stronger of the engines in this deck because of how easy it is to put an indestructible (because of WW Snow Bell) Crystal Wing on the field. But going this route blocks the extra deck and any special summon, so you should really play this on turn 1. The Spellbook engine will thin you deck and then give you 2 cards. Very nice little engine, but will use your normal summon that you probably really need to summon Rod.  I can setup the standard board with Rod ( without having to play Apprentice Illusion Magician to get a Dark Magician in Hand), I'll play the Windwitches before so that I can bait any handtraps my opponent might have in hands. If I don't have Rod and no way to setup standard DM board, I'll go with both engines. I'll try to play Secrets to get Spellbook Magician of Prophecy hoping it will get Ashed, then no matter the result, will go full windwitches. Once I have Crystal Wing on board, i'll continue with Spellbook Magician and Knowledge to complete the engine. I don't go with Spellbook Magician before playing the Windwitches, because if it gets Ashed or Effect Veilered, I have no way to  special summon Ice Bell, while if Glass Bell gets stopped, it wont prevent me from playing the rest of the Spellbook engine.  Finally, depending on the match-up, I will side either Ghost Ogre or Effect Veiller  with an Ash Blossom or Droll &amp; Lock Bird to get the Secret Village of the Spellcaster combo with Metaverse. It is very disruptive for the Trickstart, Sky Striker, True Draco players. Any other decks that require spell cards are shutdown, because no one really runs any Spellcasters in their decks ( I once got a Sky Striker player normal summing a Droll &amp; Lock Bird just so he could play)."
