And a bit annoying to face. It uses a few resources and uses graveyard as a really good resource pack. With this deck, you can go either first or second. Going first gives you the chance of going full combo and making a really good end board on your 1st turn. Going second on the other side isn't that good but it can make amazing plays as well and may have OTK potential. The rokket monsters are the main way to summon extra deck cards. Galaxy spiral dragon is used to summon number 38 hope harbinger dragon titanic galaxy and save you from some attacks and 1of your opponent's spell cards each turn. Scarlight red dragon archfiend is used to destroy opponent's special summoned monsters(your's too if any) and then do a decent amount of damage by this effect. Borreload savage dragon can be summoned really easily and can have 1-4 negations. Side deck created to face any kind of deck. Chaos Dragon Levianeer is used to destroy up to 2 of opponent's cards.

It is an aggressive deck and best going first. First thing you want to do is get out zombie world. Which you have multiple ways to access.  This deck is very consistent and easy to play. Now I will list the purpose of each card in the deck.  <strong>Main Deck</strong>  <strong>Monsters</strong>  Doomking Balerdroch: 1 monster negate and banish per turn with zombie world out.  Jack-o-Bolan: Send a zombie monster from your hand to the graveyard. The best cards to send are Necroworld Banshee and Glow-Up Bloom if you have zombie world out. While this card is on the field during your opponents turn you can use it to summon a zombie monster from your graveyard.  Necroworld Banshee: This card is mainly to get zombie world out. You want this in the graveyard at all cost while you do not have zombie world out yet. Do not summon unless you have no other option. This is also the first card you want to send to the graveyard with any effect while you do not have zombie world out on the field.  Mezuki: This card is used as a way to make Union Carrier more usable. If you have a way to send  Shiranui Solitaire: Summon this to use its effect to summon Uni-Zombie.  Uni-Zombie: If you do not have zombie world out use this to send Necroworld Banshee from your 1 Your hand and 2 Your deck if Necroworld Banshee is not in your hand. And after you do that use its effect to send Glow-Up Bloom the the graveyard. This card can also be used to synchro summon.  Dragon Buster Destruction sword: Drawing into this card is like drawing into a garnet. It is not something you want to draw but it is ok if you do. Do not send it to the graveyard as it is the card you equip to Doomking Balerdroch with Union Carrier. Doing this locks your opponent out of the extra deck.  Glow-Up Bloom: Send this card to the graveyard while zombie world is on the field to special summon Doomking Balerdroch from your deck. Keep in mind. You can only do this once per turn. A very good way to use this is to summon it to the field with another zombie monster while you have zombie world on the field to go into Union Carrier and then use its effect allowing you to summon Doomking Balerdroch and lock out your opponent from their extra deck.  <strong>Spells</strong>  One for One: Use this card to send a monster from your hand to the graveyard while you have zombie world on the field to special summon Glow-Up Bloom. Then Link Summon Linkuriboh to activate Glow-Up Blooms effect. This card is also an easy way to get out Union Carrier as you summon Glow-Up Bloom with this card and have another zombie monster on your field you can link summon Union Carrier and activate Glow-Up Bloom you can then Special summon doomking Balerdroch and then equip Dragon Buster Destruction Sword to it to lock your opponent out of the extra deck.  Dragged Down into the grave: Make sure you have nothing in your hand you want to keep before playing this card. This is a good way to check your opponents hand for any troublesome cards and you can force your opponent to send one of the cards from your hand into the graveyard.  Harpie's Feather Duster: Use this card to clear you opponents back row. This is a good card in any deck.  Triple Tactics Talent: This card is very good. Once your opponent activates any monster effects on your turn you will be able do one of these things: Take Control of one of your opponents monsters for the rest of the turn, Draw two, Or discard one card in your opponents hand of your choice. I recommend drawing 2 tho.  One Day of Peace: Essentially a plus a card to raise efficiency of the deck.  Upstart goblin: Just use it. It makes the deck basically a 39 card deck.  Card Destruction: Allows you to use zombie graveyard effects and see what kind of deck your opponent is using for your virus card. Cards to set, summon, or activate before use are; Zombie world, Uni-Zombie, Eradicator Epidemic Virus, and Rivalry of Warlords.  Terraforming: Use to get zombie world.  Foolish Burial: Use to send Necroworld Banshee to the graveyard if you do not have zombie world out. And if you do have zombie world out use to send Glow-Up Bloom to the Graveyard.  Twin Twisters: Discard and destruction of opponents spells and traps.  Super Polymerization:Use this card to special summon using your opponents monsters while you have zombie world out. If you go first set this card and wait until your opponent has 2 monsters out. If you go second activate zombie world first then use this card.  Zombie world: makes all monsters zombie type.  <strong>Traps</strong>  Infinite Impermanence: Used to negate a monster effect.  Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Use this card to send Balerdroch to the graveyard during your opponents draw phase. If you do not know what type of deck your opponent is using always choose spells.  Rivalry of Warlords: Used with Zombie world to limit your opponent to basically 1 monster on the field.  <strong>Extra Deck.</strong>  Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon: This is the monster you summon with Super Polymerization.  Union Carrier: If you manage to get this card out only do it by using Glow-Up Bloom as a Material for it while Zombie world is on the field so that you can get out Doomking Balerdroch to the field to equip your Dragon Buster Destruction sword to.  The rest of the extra deck cards are not as important and you can choose to use them or not.  For the side deck you can change those cards if you want to."

Lock your opponent out the first turn, the second turn go into hot red abyss (and bane if you want), and any links. Flash and DNA could be taken out for more meta cards but this works very well for me even against top decks. DNA surgery is clutch when you have to use buster dragon to make hot red so you don't lose it at the end of the turn.  Main weaknesses: dark ruler no more, mystic mine, nibiru  Barring borrel savage, the whole deck is budget-friendly at about $100. That being said, Borreload Savage is necessary. Buster will lock out all monsters, and barrel load savage is needed to prevent any big s/t plays."

The basic combo of this deck is to end on Borreload Savage Dragon (3 negates), Herald of Arc Light, Draglubion, and Hope Harbinger which can be done through many different combinations however the most common would be Jet Synchron and two level 8's on the field. This board is very hard to play through with 3 negates (2 omni), prevents monsters from getting to the graveyard, directs attacks to hope harbinger, and possible protection for dragon's with return of the dragon lords. If you can get 2 more level 8's on field you get an extra negate with photon lord. There is usually enough resources on the next turn to go into dingirsu.  The advanced combo for this deck requires a white stone of legends or ancients, world legacy guardragon, and one level 8 on board, this will achieve an end board of Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres, Borreload Savage (3 negates), Herald of Arc Light, Hope Harbinger.

Yes, we run Alphan instead of ritual lineup cus it makes Verte and replaces itself wh","Based on Light Tsukiko deck in OCG Structure manga. It uses all the good stuff being Herald and Timelord. But instead of using ritual, we're using Super Quant because the card advantage it gives us. I'll explain the Alphan setup, if you summon Alphan (normal summon or from Diviner of the Heralds and One for One), use eff choose Alphan, Red Layer, and White Layer (they are the best Quants main deck, it guarantees us pluses). 2/3 chance Red Layer goes to gy for free ss and the other 1/3 chance if it is summoned, we use Red recover White (not Alphan, but the big one), ss White using Red as fodder triggering Red eff for free ss. Also pay attention to White Layer effect, as its <strong>second eff</strong> may look good but it really is not, like if we already triggered Red eff there's no need to use White 2nd eff, also it ensures us to trigger another Alphan we recovered later next turn. The <strong>third eff</strong> is super great, but we have to recover Alphan from gy only, because if White is summoned/milled through Alphan, it means we would have 2 Alphan outside of the deck, we need all 3 different Super Quant in deck to trigger our recently added Alphan from gy for follow up play.  The Diviner combo is easy, we dump Trias Hierarchia (or White/Red/Time Maiden depends on what we need if we already have Trias in hand), use Trias ss itself by tributing Diviner, trigger Diviner ss Valkyrie Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, make TK of All Calamities using Trias + Sigrun while still having Sechster on the field, it means any extender can result to Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. The extenders we use are: Red Layer, Hecatrice + Valhalla, Tuner's High (searches Diviner by using lvl1 fairy fodder, works with Alphan, Time Maiden, and Sechste), Time Maiden (Tuner's High fodder, first eff to break board by adding Zaphion for backrow or Metaion for monster, second eff for follow up play doing the same as 1st eff), Foolish Burial (dump Red Layer if we have another Super Quant in gy or Trias/White Layer), and lastly One for One. The Super Quant field is there cus its just 1 material xyz for Red/White Layer as additional disruption.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/a5/TsukikoKuroda.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Great first turn board while still having Dragoon as backup if interrupted, only uses minimal resource, big staple slot, follow up play is super great thanks to Alphan and Timelord lineup, Timelord is also good going second.  Cons: Bad matchup against backrow deck."

And Pot of Avarice!,"Salamangreat deck I'm working on. The goal is to set up as many interactions as you can in the early game, then eventually follow up with a 1 card Accesscode Talker, a 5k beatstick with 2 attacks thanks to Update Jammer, and 3 targeted destructions as well to break boards.  I'm running 6-8 normal summons. 3 Lady Debug and 3 Formud Skipper are both full combo with Accesscode Talker. Lady Debug is also the start to a pretty good Salamangreat board, since it searches Gazelle or any other extender you need. Formud Skipper only has one target, Parallel EXceed. This should help you start Salamangreat plays while also getting you easy access to Abyss Dweller. 2 Foxy are backup starters, okay normal summons in a pinch, but they're also relatively free extenders and lines of interaction. I decided to skip One For One, as I don't want Skipper bad enough to pitch a card for it.  3 Parallel EXceed make full combo with any other monster, which is the main draw to them, and give easy access to Abyss Dweller. Not much else to say, just a powerful Cyberse monster that is an engine requirement and a combo piece all in one.  We've got a lot of 1 ofs in the the deck, since I'm skipping Desires. Gazelle makes the deck tick, a total engine requirement that is at 1 for a reason. Micro Coder helps make Code Talker combos possible and can search Cynet Conflict or Cynet Mining. Seems good as a 1 of. Falco, Spinny, Mole, and Jaguar are all Salamangreat extenders with various upsides. Seems worth it to run a single Mole to make the combos easier.  For hand traps I have 3 Ash, 3 D.D. Crow, and 3 Called By The Grave. Ash is not amazing right now, but the deck can recurr it, and Ashing ever turn is actually still pretty good. D.D. Crow is essential against Adamancipators, and still super clutch against Eldlich. Called is likewise useful in both of those matchups, and also protects our search heavy deck from Ash and any spicy Droll out there.  3 Cynet Mining can find either combo (which use different cards) or any extender, and can also pitch cards you want in the GY there, as well as be searchs with Micro Coder. Salamangreat Circle is also limited for a reason, both effects are stellar, and having you pick of them is insane. Salamangreat Sanctuary is an engine requirement, basically a total brick if you draw it, so even though you need it I'm only running 1. Will of the Salamangreat is essentially a free extender in any situation, and a very good one. I'm only running 2 because I don't want to see 2 copies together as often. The last spicy, spicy choice is 3 Pot of Avarice. People told me not to do this, but in testing I'm liking it a lot. Basically all of the deck's combos put 5 or more extra deck monsters in the GY off of 1 or 2 cards, and the deck is full of free extenders that remain useful as your turn goes on. This also lets you recycle used Salamangreat Monsters to continue making plays after you would be out of gas. It's insane this card is at 3, and I think more decks should take advantage of that. The downside is it won't find you a starter in a hand full of bricks, but in testing this basically never comes up. The deck is full of 1 and 2 card combos.  For traps I have 2 Rage, 1 Roar, and 1 Cynet Conflict. Conflict could basically be Roar #2, I might be wrong to run this, it's just here so Microcoder can search it as part of the Accesscode combo. It does help in that circumstance. Good traps are good, getting multiple lines of good interaction I can search is helpful to surviving to OTK with Accesscode. Might switch to 2 Roar.  For the extra deck we have 3 Balynx, insane card, must run 3. It starts all of your combos by searching Sanctuary. 3 Sunlight Wolf. With Pot of Avarice you'll easily go through more than 3 of these in a game. This can recurr Ash, recurr your traps making Gazelle even better, recurr combo pieces or extenders. 2 each of Heatleo and Pyropheonix. This give ways to interact with your opponents and Salamangreat beatsticks, very good for doing what Salamangreats do best. I'd love more of these, but that's what Avarice is for. Update Jammer, Transcode, and Accesscode are for the Accesscode combo. 2 Transcode is for the Code Talker trap - you can often end on Pyro Phoenix and Transcode Talker with both counter-traps.  Against Eldlich, side 3 D.D. Crow, 3 Cosmic Cyclone, and 3 Called. Very similar to normal set up. Against Adamancipators side 3 Nibiru, 3 D.D. Crow, and either 3 Called by the Grave or 3 Dark Ruler No More, depending on whether you're going first or second. Against Altergeist side 3 Cyclone, 3 Lightning Storm, 3 Evenly. Against combo going second, side 3 Evenly, 3 Dark Ruler, and 3 of any relevant hand trap or Lightning Storm if you know they end with backrow/attack position monsters such as links. We're basically counting on a recurrable Ash being good enough against everything else (along the other lines of interaction like Roar, Circle, etc).  1 card Accesscode Talker combos  Lady Debug Combo <ol>  	<li>Summon Lady Debug, searching Gazelle.</li>  	<li>Link Lady Debug into Baleynx, searching Sanctuary.

That deck was a Blue-eyes themed deck, with some of my added favorite cards. I have now added a better side-deck, better blue-eyes cards, and a slightly better extra deck, plus some more tuners. You can just wait until you get Blue-eyes and Alternative, or use cards to get them, like Melody of awakening dragon, then get rid of your opponents monsters with Alternative's effect, and fuse to get Alternative Ultimate. It's a really good card. You can bring back dead dragons with Red-eyes darkness metal, and get them into the graveyard with Dragon's shrine, or you can get White stone in the graveyard, to special summon a blue-eyes monster. Or you can let your monsters get destroyed and then summon interplanetary purplythorny dragon to the field, and use instant fusion or poly to fuse some tuner from your hand/field to create Sea Monster of Theseus, then with those two syncrho summon Ascension Sky dragon, or use other tuners to summon other Synchros, like Brionac. There is a slightly more detailed description with links to the cards I'm talking about on the other deck. Either way you should look at it, because they have some differences in card types.

Basically you start with Faris, Stratos and other fodders to play the Xtra Link monsters to have materials for fusions, in order Cross Crusader using Malicious to add a Hero (possibly Adusted Gold, Hell Devicer for materials and Dread Decimator to boost). Make Sunrise, had Miracle Fusion, do another fusion in view of what you face, summon Malicious Bane with Dark Calling, break the weaklings, go for opponent's LP. Dark Law, Super Poly and Dark Ruler in case you need them.  The side is little cause I think the main deck is good as it is, and you can switch some fusion depending on the opponent. Not sure what else to add. Maybe something in case you have to go first.  Any suggestion is welcomed."

Link Balancer Lord and Pikari @Ignister into Cyberse Wicckid, and use Parallel Exceed to special summon itself because you summoned a link monster. Use Cyberse Wicckid to banish Balancer Lord and add Bururu @Ignister to your hand.  Activate Balancer Lord's effect to special summon the Bururu @Ignister from your hand. Then use Parallel Exceed's effect to special summon another copy of itself from the deck, but remember, both Parallel Exceeds are level 4 due to being summoned by Parallel Exceed's effect. Activate A.I.Land. Link Cyberse Wicckid, Bururu @Ignister, and 1 Parallel Exceed to make Dark Templar @Ignister. Then link the other Parallel Exceed into a Linguriboh. Use Dark Templar @Ignister's effect to special summon Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister from your graveyard to zones Dark Templar @Ignister point to. Synchro summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister using Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister. Bururu @Ignister will revive the other synchro material, so in this case, Pikari @Ignister. Pikari @Ignister will make Wind Pegasus @Ignister level 4. Xyz summon Light Dragon @Ignister using Wind Pegasus @Ignister and Pikari @Ignister. Now link Linguriboh and Dark Templar @Ignister to summon Accesscode Talker.  So now you have Light Dragon @Ignister to destroy your opponent's board and Accesscode Talker with 5300 attack points ready to destroy your opponent's cards by banishing different attribute monsters in your graveyard, which is a lot of different attributes. Not to mention you have 2 or 3 cards in your hand left, it just depends if you're going first or 2nd. Also thanks to @Rei on discord for teaching me this combo!  &nbsp;"

Back with another deck profile here, but this time I chose to remake my old Salad list, because it's kinda old, so here is a new deck with why the cards are included in the deck at all!</span>  <span>Monsters(23)</span>  <span>3x Parallel eXceed - This card is a new card that I think should be played more often, and it definitely will with all its cool effects! One of these effects are to special summon itself from the hand to a link arrow zone when a link monster is summoned to the field, and if you do, its level is 4 and its stats (ATK and DEF) are halved, it also has another effect to bring another copy of itself to the field from the deck. So, what I'm getting from this card is that you can instantly make any generic r4nk in the game with just one special summon and a link summon (of course link summon first). This card is great for just making our pal Number 41: Bagooska from the deck immediately, potentially becoming a complete overpower towards your opponent.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Jack Jaguar - Jack is part of the Salad monsters, really only here for its effect to shuffle one Salad monster from your grave to your deck to special itself to a zone a link monster points to. So, this card is just a neat way to get r4anks easily, or more links on the field. This could be a target for Gazelle, mostly being so.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Fowl - This bird is also here for its level (4) and its effect to special itself from the hand if another Salad is summoned on the field, being great for, again, being material for either a r4nk or a link summon. But it has another little effect, too. This lets it target a facedown on your opponent's board, and basically negate it, while it's set facedown on the field, all at the cost of the demise of a Salad from the hand, which is actually more of a benefit for the deck than a downside.</span>  <span>3x Lady Debug - Ah, Lady Debug, by far the best searcher of the deck, letting you add any level 3 or lower Cyberse monster from your deck to your hand. This card was </span><i><span>so good, </span></i><span>that it was limited for a time, and now its back to 3, which is convenient since we lost a little consistency when we had the card limited. This is your primary normal summon, being a search if its overall summoned. This is yet another level 4, being good material for r4ank, links, and really good for Baleynx.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Falco - This Salad is here for its effect, if sent to the graveyard, to set one Salad spell/trap from the gy, which is good for getting that essential rage back to the field, or that roar that will come in handy later game. This card is a good level 4, and therefore is r4ank and link material.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Gazelle - This card is also very good, being limited currently, having the effect to Foolish Burial and Salad from the deck (besides itself) if it was summoned, and then could be special summoned if another Salad went to the gy, besides itself. This card can start so many plays just by being on the field and having its effect go through.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Spinny - Spinny is only here to discard and special itself from the gy. Spinny just adds towards our goal to link summon, aiding as a link material for pretty much everything.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Foxy - Any Salad deck would be a joke if we didn't have a decent normal summon out of Foxy, being a good face up spell/trap destroyer from gy, or excavating cards until he finds a Salad card, adding that to hand, and shuffling everything else back. He adds to the link summoning cause, and yeah, he's the second most important normal summon.</span>  <span>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - This card.... is just too good! being able to negate just about ANYTHING a meta deck throws in your way, and only being negated by a select few cards, some of them never showing up in people's decks. Ash is probably THE best hand trap of the game, besides Nibiru.</span>  <span>1x Micro Talker - Micro Talker is here for many reasons, one of them being it can be used as link material from the hand, which is nuts, and it's other effect that if it was sent to the gy as link material from the hand/field, you can add any one Cynet spell/trap from your deck to the hand, and if it was used as link material on the field, the search was instead a level 4 cyberse instead. As I said, this card is </span><i><span>crazy.</span></i>  <span>3x D.D. Crow - This is a very affordable hand trap, being good, too, banishing a card from your opponent's gy is nothing to laugh at.</span>  <span>2x Formud Skipper - Formud is actually a decent card in Salad, being able to mimick one of your link monsters and make reincarnation link summoning WAY easier.</span>  <span>Spells (10)</span>  <span>2x Will of the Salamangreat - This is probably the best spell card for this deck, either to special summon a Salad monster from the hand, once per turn. But, in my opinion, the better option was to special summon Salad monsters, up to the number of a reincarnated link summoned Salad monster on the field, which can be from 1-3, being Salamangreat Baleynx, Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf, and Salamangreat Heatleo. </span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Sanctuary - This is the field spell of the deck, giving you the ability to reincarnation link summon any Salad link monster. We only play one to avoid any consistency issues with the deck, having extra copies can damage the hand and hinder the deck’s consistency. We also only run one because it can be easy to search out by the combo starter of the deck, Salamangreat Balenyx.</span>  <span>3x Cynet Mining - Cynet Mining is the best searcher, for our searcher, Lady Debug, or our little friend Salamangreat Gazelle, or heck, add Micro Coder for its useful effect!</span>  <span>1x One for One - This card is only here to either add Formud Skipper or Micro Coder from our deck to the hand, could be a easy bait for that Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring your opponent may have.</span>  <span>2x Pot of Desires - This pot is basically the generic draw support of the meta. Sure, banishing 10 cards facedown is kinda bad, but you get two cards off of it, and it's why we play more than one copy of certain cards. Also, before you use this card, finish the necessary combos before using this card.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Circle - This card is, again, a searcher for either Gazelle or Foxy, being able to get you cards you need, of the Salad archetype, from your deck to the players hand.</span>  <span>Traps (9)</span>  <span>1x Cynet Conflict - This card is a negation card for the CodeTalker archetype, and were running it because we have two different CodeTalkers in the deck, Accesscode Talker, and Transcode Talker.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Roar - This negate is for our dominate archetype of the deck, Salamangreat, therefore you're probably gonna use this one more often, as it can come back from the gy after use if there was a reincarnation linked monster on the field, but it gets banished when it leaves the field. So, with this effect, it can be reused.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Rage - This card is the deck’s main removal, being able to effectively destroy up to 3 cards on the field, being great for Sky Striker matchups since that’s the usual amount of cards they have on the field.</span>  <span>1x Gravedigger's Trap Hole - This card...., how do I explain this amazing new card? It's effect by itself is powerful, letting you negate a effect from your opponent's hand, grave, or a monster's effect from banished, THEN you can inflict 2000 damage after already negate an effect. This card is the only card you can set with our Traptrix Raffleisa's effect, which sends it to the gy and then gains it's effect. This trap matches up well with Thunder Dragon, negating the majority of it's effects AND making them fear that possible face down, but then there is Dinos, which are also a problem right now, but most importantly, mirror matches are going to be a breeze, unless it's this exact deck, then I would watch out if I was you.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Extra Deck (15)</span>  <span>1x Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir - This card is probably the best r4ank in the game, if it's not Abyss Dweller, who'll we'll get into later. In it's effect, you have to detach a material from it each standby phase, if not, destroy it. But, it's neither targeted nor destroyed by card effects if in attack position. The real reason why it's here is for it's other effect, which can initiate some OTK's this deck may have, and that is to make every monster on the field (face up) to defense (also face up), and negates any effect that may activate in response, as long as it's a monster effect. This card is a must have in every deck that can make r4anks, or at least a recommendation.</span>  <span>1x Number 60: Dugares the Timeless - This card is another great r4ank that can be pretty game changing, with an effect that can skip your next draw phase, and then let you draw two cards and discard one card, excellent fuel for Gazelle's effect if you discard a Salad monster. Another effect it has is to skip your next main phase, and then special summon a monster from the gy in face-up defense position. Then the last effect is to skip your next battle phase, then double one monster's attack points (your field) for the rest of that turn. You can only activate one of these effects, and you gotta detach two materials to activate any of the effects listed above you.</span>  <span>1x Traptrix Rafflesia - This card is mainly here for the same reason as Gravedigger's Trap Hole, mainly for it to detach a material from itself and then send a ""Trap Hole"" trap card from the deck to the gy, then it's effect becomes that. So in this case, a really good effect that will benefit this deck a lot when it's in a pickle, also Nibiru gets negated from this (Gravedigger's Trap Hole's effect on it, of course).</span>  <span>1x Accesscode Talker - This card should be played for many reasons, one of those reason's are that it can gain attack off of a link monster used for it's link summon, 1 rating being 1000 ATK. Another reason would be it's removal effect, which is pretty straightfoward, banish a link monster, pop a card (monster) with the same Attribute, but you can't banish monster's with the same Attribute as the monster you used to activate Accesscode Talker's effect. Oh, one more thing about it's other effect, it can't be responded to, negated, nothing, absolutely nada. The second effect also doesn't target, making it insanely powerful in that single fact. It is also not a once per turn. With that, this card can possibly be banned in the upcoming banlists.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Heatleo - This card isn't used an awful lot in this deck, mainly used for it's cool back row removal effect, or that useful attack boosting effect, but other than that, it's just not used as much as the next Salamangreat card on this list.</span>  <span>1x Transcode Talker - The infamous Transcode Talker and Update Jammer combo. I'll tell you how to do it in the bottom.</span>  <span>1x Update Jammer - Same reason as Transcode, simply for it's neat effect and it's role in it;s combo, which will be shown below.</span>  <span>3x Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf - This card is the main link summon (besides Balyenx) that you must accomplish on turn one. This isn't optional as you need to make this before comboing off, unless you decide to take the turn two approach and combo into the old Transcode and Update OTK.</span>  3x Salamangreat Baleynx - Baleynx is the starter of the deck, being the first monster from the extra deck every game, or at least that's the priority for this deck as it protects Salamangreat cards once from destruction.  1x Splash Mage - This card can act as a monster reborn for your Cyberse monsters, but it negates it's effects, also it locks you out of special summoning any other monsters for the turn, besides Cyberse, which, if you think about it, isn't that horrible, since all of the monsters in the deck are Cyberse. Another reason why this card is here is for fuel for Accesscode Talker's effect, since you can't banish the same Attribute of the link monster used to activate it's effect.  &nbsp;  Side Deck (15)  The cards currently placed in the Side Deck are simply for filler, you can do whatever you want with this part of the deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Combo:  NS=Normal Summon  SS=Special Summon  &nbsp;  Update+Transcode  NS Lady Debug  Activate it's effect to add Salamangreat Gazelle  SS using Lady Debug into Salamangreat Baleynx  Use Balenyx's effect to add Salamangreat Sancturary  Activate Sancturary to then reincarnation link summon another Baleynx  Activate Gazelle from hand to SS itself when the other Baleynx is sent for Reincarnation Link Summon Baleynx.

Welcome to the Brotherhoo","Hey Everyone, Rhysbans (Reese-bans) is here again with another installment of Karakuri in the Halqifibrax era. Before you chalk this up to a ""oh, this is just another Needlefiber + Tier Z deck that can get the surprise win every so often"" you'd be misunderstanding this deck. The deck is both an offensive and defensive deck that can beat Eldlich Auroradon, break Adamancipator's boards, beat Invoked, and dance around the new Trish Ritual decks coming out in the meta. On top of that, I am using Card of Fate - a card you'll either need to google or scoff at.  Before you leave, there are multiple reasons why I am running Card of Fate in a Karakuri Auroradon build. First, never has it mattered less what is in your opponents hand during your turn. Sure they can draw into hand traps, but the fact that you are pushing more resources into your own hand to extend plays is worth the effort.  And in many ways, my only real goal for turn one is to get a Jet Synchron in my hand at all costs; and, let's be honest, your opponent is going to have a way to get their cards in this era of Yugioh. A simple -1 for an extension can get you the combo pieces you need for a VFD, Naturia Beast, Prohibition, or Karakuri Shogan lvl 9. On top of that, if you have any sense of the duel your playing/current meta trends on EdoPro then Prohibition is a staple this format. Nibiru, Ash, Halqifibrax, Eldlich the Golden Lord, and then use Google for anything else you want to Prohibit.  If at this point you are still reading and now think, ""Wow this a tier Z deck with trash tech, this guy is full of crap."" Let me explain the combos in the deck.  Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh -&gt; Halq + 001 -&gt; Auroradon trib self and one token for O-Lion -&gt; Get lvl 8 Karakuri it searches for lvl 1 -&gt; Synch off for lvl 9 Karakuri -&gt; Lvl 9 searches for lvl 5 Karakuri -&gt; 001 + Lvl 5 + Token (lvl 3) == Ravenous Croco == 2 draws -&gt; 2 lvl 9s == VFD  &nbsp;  But Rhysbans, that combo can be broken. We have Prohibtion and Called by the Grave for protection. Don't feel comfortable with Prohibition? Trade in my Called by the Grave. You are running 3 tunings, 2 Jets, and 2 Card of Fate to get that Tuning/Jet in your hand at all costs.  Combo two: Have a Lvl 2 Karakuri in hand  Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh -&gt; Halq + 001 -&gt; Auroradon trib self and one token for O-Lion -&gt; Get lvl 8 Karakuri it searches for lvl 1 -&gt; Synch off for lvl 9 -&gt; Search Lvl 3 Karakuri -&gt; Extra NS from Lvl 3 to Lvl 2 -&gt; Lvl 2 searches for their Premature Burial Card or their Counter Trap or their Negate Effect Trap (you have options)-&gt; Naturial beast with 2+3 -&gt; If you took premature burial ss the lvl 8 and either do the lvl 1 effect for a draw or link off with 001 to get another lvl 9 (your call on what) and then you can have VFD and Naturia Beast. GG  Using the Gizmek lvl 9, and have played with two in this deck before shrugging into the Card of Fate. Gizmek Lvl 9 in this deck is butter.  Last Notes: You will get disrupted, you will have recovery plays. You aren't running bricks in this. Dark Hole isn't tech, it's stupid not to run Dark Ruler No More and non targeting spells in this era.  Poster Child: Karakuri 177. This card is a one star hero- searcher for a premature burial, or counter trap that is anti s/t, a way to get into a lvl 9 banisher and lvl 8 drawer, or their Infinite Impermance.

It has been shown to take out full power Orcust with Maxx C. Please enjoy and have fun with,"This deck has a lot of moving parts, But ill going to get into the nitty and gritty, so be prepared. The Invoked and Shaddoll part of the deck is to primarily help to go first, with Winda and Mechaba. Dragma are your main damage dealers and Extra Deck destroyers. Since they destroy your OWN deck, N'tss and Shadoll Fusions are a no-brainer. There are some weird choices in this, so hang tight. The main boss monster(s) of the deck are Construct, Cardinal of Dogma Tetradragmatton, and Fleur-De-Lis, the Knight of Dragma, just to get that out of the way.  The Dragma part is the main part of the Deck. It gets rid of both yours and your opponents Extra Deck. Seems Great for a Go first deck, but as you will see, they're better at going second. Be forewarned, as both of their searchers (Ecclesia and Disciple from Nadir) lock you out of Extra Deck, so make sure to keep that in mind. Your smaller monster for the deck is Ecclesia, the searcher, and Adin, the summoner. Both of them share an effect stem, ""Cannot be destroyed by battle with a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. You can only use each of the following effects of (this monsters name) once per turn. <ol>  	<li> If a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is on the field: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.</li>  	<li>(insert individual effects here.)""</li> </ol> Ecclesia has 1500 Atk and Def. She can add any Dragma card to the hand, at the cost of locking you out of your Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. This can help Swarming the field with her and Adin, and they're both Level 4, so If you open with both of them in your hand, you can make a Rank 4, like <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. Adin has 1000 and Def, and can Special Summon a Dragma from the deck when he's destroyed. This can also obviously help, as it can get their larger monsters out, like Maximus and Fleur-De-Lis. Now, let's get to their larger monsters.  First, is Maximus Dragma. He has 1500 Atk and a PHAT 3000 Def. It can special summon itself by banishing a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster in your GY. We haven't seen it yet, but they do have some options to dump these. though you Can summon this with Adin, so that's a plus. It's other effect has both players dump 2 cards WITH DIFFERENT NAMES from Extra Deck. This also locks you out of the Extra Deck, and your opponent gets to chose, that's not an issue. you get to dump an N'tss AND an Apkallone. Though a combo I'll get into in the Shaddoll part, this can allow you to banish the cards your opponent just dumped.  Then, there's Cardinal of Dogma Tetradragmatton. it's a 3200 Atk and Def behemoth that must be special summoned by banishing 4 Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/OR Link monsters, with no other ways to summon it, not even from the GY. and when it attacks one of your opponents Special summoned monsters, it destroys all of their Attack Position Monsters then burns for 800 for each Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monsters. While this has no protection whatsoever, that's a good tradeoff for being able to get rid of ALL YOUR OPPONENTS ATTACK POSITION MONSTERS. The burn on this is just icing on the cake.  Finally, there's Fleur-De-Lis, the Knight of Dragma. He can special summon itself from the hand if a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is on either player's field. The wording on this is important.  the others effects can be negated, while this cannot, unless they use a Solem or something. The other effect on this guy is that when any Dragma declares an attack, you can have all of them permanently gain 500 Atk (both of these are hard OPTs). This helps to Beat those Virgin Adamacipators into shape. getting Tetradragmatton to 3700 Atk is super deadly.  &lt;!--more--&gt;  Now, it's Finally Time for the Spell/Traps. There's a Normal spell, Field Spell, and 2 Traps. you waited 6 paragraphs for this, so let's just jump into it. Disciple from Nadir is a Normal Spell that reads, ""Send 1 monster from your Extra Deck to the GY, then add 1 ""Dragma"" monster or 1 [NAME REDACTED] from your Deck or GY to your hand with ATK less than or equal to the sent monster's. For the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck. You can only activate 1 ""Disciple of the Nadir"" per turn."" This helps to get your combo pieces for obvious reasons, but there are no monsters in the Extra deck that surpass 3200 Atk, so <a data-name=""Tetradragmatton"">Tetradragmatton</a> can't be searched.  Now, the field spell,  <a data-name=""Dogmatic Nation Dragma"">Dogmatic Nation Dragma</a>. it reads, ""Neither player can target ""Dragma"" monsters you control with the effects of monsters that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. You can only use the following effects of ""Dogmatic Nation Dragma"" once per turn. <ol>  	<li>After damage calculation, if your ""Dragma"" monster battled an opponent's monster: You can destroy that opponent's monster.</li>  	<li>If this face-up card in the Field Zone is destroyed by an opponent's card effect: You can make each player send 1 monster from their Extra Deck to the GY.""</li> </ol> This is the protection that the Dragma need, but it isn't necessary. They can get rid of the threats before they threaten them. but you can crash your Dragma into a monster, and destroy it.  Next, the traps. Let's start off with Dragma Encounter. It allows you to special summon a Dragma from your hand. But it can also add a Dragma from your GY to your hand OR special summon it. that or effect is for Tetradragmatton, as it can't be special summoned from the Grave. How does it help? Hmm, it recovers during opponents turn so that's a plus. But it's a trap, so...  Finally, we get to Dragma Punishment. It says, ""Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; send 1 monster from your Extra Deck to the GY with an equal or higher ATK, and if you do, destroy the targeted monster. Until the end of your next turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck. You can only activate 1 ""Dragma Punishment"" per turn."" Do I need to say why you need to run it? Anything under or equal 2500 is getting destroyed AND another pop thanks to N'tss having 2500.  &lt;!--more--&gt;Next is the Invoked part of the deck. Like I said before, this is to help the deck with its main weakness, going second (Like Mekk-Knights.) Just running 2 of Aleister, <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, and <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> is enough, but I recommend adding <a data-name=""The Book of Law"">The Book of Law</a> to the mix for 2 reasons. <ol>  	<li>It can cycle through Invoked on a Quick-Play. When Mechaba is done with his effect, put out a Raidjin.</li>  	<li>It works on BOTH PLAYERS INVOKED MONSTERS.  With invoked being so rampant, having this can turn your opponents Mechaba to your own Prgatrio.</li> </ol> Now onto the Shaddolls. Beast for a draw, Dragon for dem Eldliches, Winda to set your Dragon, then there's Ariel. Remember when I said you could banish the cards you sent with Maximus? This is how. send Ariel by the effect of Apkalone, then banish 3 cards from their GY. This can hurt Eldlich, OR thanks to punishment, you can get rid of a Hal combo by banishing their Jet and Hal. Pretty good, huh?  &lt;!--more--&gt;  Now, why don't I have a Side Deck? Because I don't know what to put in there. Please tell me what to put in there to make this deck even better! Thanks for reading this essay. I'll try to make something like this every day. Hopefully Next day, Mathmech, my favourite archetype!  &nbsp;"

The deck is better going second because of the Monarch engine but has good options going first with cards like Re-qliate, Soul Transition, and Monarch Stormforth.  Cards like Skill drain, Rescue Hamster and Cyber Dragon Nova/Infinity are an option of course, however this list is supposed to be pure Qli´s and personally i don´t like them in the deck.  If played correctly you can get a lot of advantage, that said the deck is not easy to play if your not familiar with Qli´s.  As always don't copy a deck 1 to 1, add your flavor to it.  I love Qliphorts a lot and i´m working on them all the time to make them as good as possible."

If you draw into Jet Synchron/tuning/one for one, you can create a true king of all calamities. This is how the combo works.  1 normal summon Jet Synchron  2 link summon Linkuriboh with Jet Synchron  3 activate Jet synchron's affect and discard a card( for this combo it will be Adamancipator Analyzer) to SS itself (if you drew into Deskbot 001 discard it with jet Synchrons affect)  4 link summon Crystron Halqifibrax with Jet Synchron and Linkuriboh  5 activate crystron halqifibrax affect and SS deskbot 001  6 link summon Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon with deskbot 001 and crystron halqifibrax  7 activate Auroradon's affect and SS 3 tokens  8 trigger Deskbot 001's affect to SS itself  9 activate Auroradon's affect and destroy Auroradon and 1 token to SS Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion  10 synchro summon Garden Rose Maiden with O-Lion and 1 L3 token  11 activate O-Lion's affect and SS a token  12 synchro summon coral dragon with Deskbot 001 and Garden Rose Maiden  13 Synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys with coral dragon and 1 L3 token  14 activate coral dragon and draw a card  15 activate Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys and draw a card  16 activate Garden Rose Maiden's affect and SS Coral Dragon  17 Synchro summon Vermillion Dragon Mech with coral dragon and last L3 token.  18 XYZ summon True King of all calamities with Vermillion Dragon Mech and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys  This is the basic jet synchron combo but I am going to continue with what you can do with Adamancipator after this combo is performed.  19 activate Adamancipator signs and SS Analyzer. Place Dragite on top of deck with signs affect.  20 activate Adamancipator Analyzer's affect SS Dragite.  21 activate Dragite's affect to draw a card  22 SS Adamancipator Seeker with its own affect  23 activate Seeker's affect and SS Koa'ki Meiru Guardian  24 Synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon with Dragite and Anylizer  25 activate Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Auroradon to it  26 Synchro summon Raptite with with Seeker and Guardian  27 activate Raptite and Summon another Analyzer  28 SS Adamancipator Researcher  29 activate Adamancipator Researcher and SS Tackle Crusader  30 Synchro summon Draco Berserker of the Tenyi with Analyzer and Tackle Crusader  31 Synchro summon Adamancipator Risen-Dragite with Raptite and Researcher  32 Summon block dragon in defense position by banishing Guardian Tackle Crusader and Seeker  Now you have an incredible board with True king of all Calamities, Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, Adamancipator Risen-Dragite, and Borreload Savage Dragon.

In order to being able to do so, I put some cards that supports the strategy. First of all, Legacy of the duelist to limit your opponent setting card (which Is the only thing he can do, after the Zexal's effect succeded). Then Lightning storm, to have your opponent's field cleared when you go second, or when it has some dangerous board. A personal choice, is the Overlay Regen to improve Zexal's attack and consequently that chance to keep it on the field. Another important card of this deck to prevent Zexal to be targeted when activate its effect, is Sauravis which is good against cards like Infinite Impermanence or Sky striker- Widow Anchor. I also put mystic mine to overstop your opponent in some cases For the side deck feel free to substitute some cards with Mind drain, or some drain cards except Skill drain. Prohibition is an evergreen side deck cards that many Players undervalues, but in this deck is good. Another good card could be ""Lose 1 turn"" because of the timing of zexal and another one could be the new lv 10 Gizmek monster, up to enter in tcg. You have a 9 on 10 chance to put zexal on the first turn with this deck. Enjoy!"

A few highlights  Card Destruction + Cat + Ayers gives you a free summon on cat and leaves a normal summon and +2 draw -2 cards, good for bad hands or even a good hand with a rag in grave and +2 can give you a higher chance faultroll and maybe lucky*2 faultroll  Tensu/Tenkai Combo is amazing for this deck. Rag in hand and Boggart + 1 monsters (Cat/Monk) give you normal + Boggart Normal so you hit +2 Monster, +2 Cat, Needle -1 leaving you Boggart, Nat Beast,  Boggart + Needle = link 3 going to Apollousa allowing for Magic negate and Monster effect negate.  Hand loop 1 Faul/Cat/Tensu/Rag (This one is a harder one to pull off due to the combo needed) (You can also play off 1 Faul/Cat/Reborn(Runs a lot in this deck) but you can get all 5 first turn  There a lot you can do, but as you've noticed the Cat/Monk is the biggest weakness overall."

Down below will be the old information for those that want it.  The only real update to the deck is the fact that we now have Called by at 1 and so I filled choose to fill in more from what the extra deck already had. However, an option to compensate for Called by that have been brought to my attention is Debunk. It is a trap card so you'll have to play that wisely. A tech option is adding in Zeus replacing Avramax as in my play runs of the deck he is very often not touched. Now just with the replacement of Zeus doesn't mean you'll be cleaning house, but he can help.   The OG stuffs The idea of the deck is to run in one of 3 routes.  1) Run the normal Crusadia line to Equimax or Avramax and punch out your opponents life points.  2) Spam out your Super Quant extra deck monsters to get your King with 4+ material and then beat at your opponent with him.  3) My favorite yet a challenge, is to end with Equimax and Super Quant King on field with 4+ material. Equimax should point at your King so he gains the ATK boost and since your King has 4+ material he can still attack. Effectively attempting to overwhelm the field with power.  Level 3 and 4 Crusadia monsters make for easy spamming out to the Super Quant Mech Beasts even if you don't use Super Quant monsters to make the beasts. Only down side would be the inability for that monsters quick effect if it doesn't have the corresponding layer.  The side deck functions more in favor for the Super Quant engine then anything else and is only what I use. Level 3 and 4 Crusadia monsters make for easy spamming out to the Super Quant Mech Beasts  Obviously you're free to try what works better for your play style."

The Main Combo: 1. Summon Controller(Via Dai or Normal Summon) 2. Summon Tenyi 1 3. Link Into Monk 4. Summon Tenyi 2(If Ashuna was Tenyi 1, Make sure to use Ashuna GY ability after This summon) 5. Summon Shaman 6. Discard Card to summon Mare Mare(Get it to GY with Vessel, Foolish or Discard from Shaman) 7. Summon All 3 Tokens 8. Link Tokens and Mare into Sahasrara. End Board: Shaman, Controller, Sahasrara. If you expect a negate to appear on the board soon, make sure to get the Sahas tokens out sooner rather than later.  Extra Deck: You shouldnt really be looking to summon Baxia, Yazi, or Triforce if you need to activate Shaman's Summoning effect. Triforce is meant to be very late game, because summoning it off of a sahas token gets you the ability to resummon Baxia and Ashuna. Yazi, Baxia, and Ogre are you more common 2nd Turn Plays.  If I find that the controller is not a big enough Monster to protect itself, Sub it and Triforce out with Warwolf and Naturia Beast. And if you're going second, most likely will sub out Called for Dark Ruler(If playing against Big Board Decks).  Definitely want feedback so post down below with thoughts and possible tweaks."

Main combo if Going 1st: Servant Effect summon(However you can with the spells in hand) Use Servant Effect to bring out either Master or jackal(Depends on which you prefer. Best bet is Master) Summon Controller(Most likely from Dai before Servant Effect) Synchro Triarm and use effect to force a discard on the opponent.  If Going 2nd, Switch out Triarm with Horus in the combo and take control of an opponent's Monster.  Engine 2: Summoner Monk Effect to bring out blastfan Blastfan adds Oracle which summons itself Link into I:P Link into Selene Resummon Blastfan off Selene to get another search(Repeat each time when necessary)  Side Deck: Sub in Halqi Linkross combo using Overseer rather than O-Lion to be able to Turbo into selene with synchro fodder on the board."

Ash blossom on your NS Aleister hurts most but because of that we brought the called by the grave. Nibiru as one of the main interruption in this format can be avoided easily because even the main combos do not use that much summons. This deck itself does not offer much negates however many other forms of disruption like <a data-name=""Dragma Punishment"">Dragma Punishment</a> or you drop a <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> during their combo (with apkallone). If you see in game one that your opponents is playing a combo heavy deck but tries to avoid Nibiru or sets up early negates in his combo then swap Nibiru for Gizmek Uka and according barrier statue.  Your main 2 card combo is <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> and <a data-name=""Maximus Dragma"">Maximus Dragma</a> both are searchable in this deck so the combo is consistent enough to pull it off regularly. You NS Aleister, search Invocation -&gt; Link Almiraj -&gt; Link Gardna -&gt; Invocation for Mechaba -&gt; SS Maximus (remove Almiraj) -&gt; Maximus effect, drop Apkallone and either Ashen Dragon or something situational like N`tss to pop a card or Sabre Dancer to prepare for OTK -&gt; use Apkallone to search Shaddoll Ruq, set Ruq -&gt; Do all the other Stuff you want -&gt; During End Phase you can search Fleur-De-Lis (additional interruption) if you dropped Ashen Dragon with Maximus -&gt; Opponents turn, Main Phase, use Ruq to fusion Winda. Try to chain this to an effect that SS something so that they immediately used their one SS after winda hits the field -&gt; Use Fleur-De-Lis effect -&gt; SS Fleur-De-Lis and negate the monster they just put on the field. If they cant clear your board with Spell/Trap cards or the few monster they summoned you successfully locked them out of the game.  Any feedback is appreciated."

On a good hand(Crystal Beacon + Crystal Bond) you can easily go +7-9, and you can even recover from much less good hands and go +6-7 if you get good luck with the Adamancipators. This deck is obviously far from viable, and would need major improvements to be considered even slightly so. Firstly, it doesn't really have a way to get past handtraps, and even though it can get a lot of advantage, almost every card in the deck NEEDS to be there, so finding room for handtraps while still staying consistent will take a better duelist than I. Secondly, there is a bit of luck involved, especially with the Adamancipators. It's not <em>too </em>important on a good hand, but if you open with just Pegasus, you better pray for some good luck. Thirdly, I don't really know how to make a good side deck, so you'll have to do that yourself. Also, this card is technically TCG legal, but Zenith isn't out in the TCG. All you need to make it OCG legal it to take out the second Saryuja, I recommend replacing it with Link Spider.  On a side note, do NOT do what I did in the first clip and use Raptite's effect to summon a monster and then summon Saryuja. Instead, use your Zenith's ability and special summon a CB from the deck while adding a Rainbow Dragon to your hand. This allows you to thin two more cards from your deck before you summon saryuja, not to mention you'll be shuffling some bricks in your hand to the bottom of the deck, making it easier for Raptite to pull a monster from the top 5 cards of your deck."

PLEASE!)","I know I'm late to the party, but I had made a Paleozoic Frog deck after the MR5 Banlist for the TCG. The deck just isn't the same without 3 or even 2 Toadally Awesome, but I decided to make do with what I had.  &nbsp;  The reason why I named this deck ""Toadally Screwed"" isn't to lament my favorite control deck getting nerfed. It's because it runs an engine of 3 Fury of Kairyu-Shin and 3 Torrential Tribute. Fury of Kairyu-Shin works moderately well in this deck. After searching Torrential Tribute with it, and then summoning a Frog with Toadally Awesome or summoning a Paleo trap, you can protect your monsters with Fury's graveyard effect.  &nbsp;  Hopefully, Konami will pull their heads out of their *ss and just limit Bahamut Shark instead, since it contributed to Toadally Awesome getting Limited."
