My complete breakdown for how to build and pilot starry knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Unlike normally where I just list my card and reasonings I decided to write a little info on every starry knight card and how many copies of those cards, from my experience, you should play so you can build your own Starry Knight deck!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight is a deck with a play style that is actually kinda similar to zombie world where you have a big boss monster and everything else is meant for utility and recursion.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let’s start</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Night Starry Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The face of the deck! Starry Night Starry Dragon is a card that is completely required when piloting starry knights, it has a few effects that I’ll explain.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">First off it has an effect when it hits the field provided it was in your hand, upon entering it gives you the option pop a card Which is really handy, there is no opt on this so juggling it for repeated pops is a thing, in fact that’s what the deck is meant to do!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s second effect is actually really good for certain matchups, the dragon here has a continuous effect that makes it immune to all dark monsters from both battle and card effects, it’s third effect is the cherry on the top though</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The last effect is the only effect that has any opt on it, but it’s a soft opt. If Starry Night Starry Dragon attacks a monster you’re able to just banish that monster and attack again, no targeting, no destruction, this means that Starry Dragon is literally anti dragoon, it’s able to out it and can’t be negated by it or effected by it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When it comes to how many of this mighty dragon you should play I suggest one or two, I like two because I get a backup if my opponent manages to disrupt it, and three is a little excessive because you got enough ways to get it so two is enough, you can play one but that does come with the issue of not having a backup.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Rayel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel is probably one of the best cards Starry Knights have to offer, it comes with two helpful effects.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On normal summon Rayel gets to search any Starry Knight spell or trap to add to your hand, it’s a hard opt, likely because of Starry Sky which I’ll explain later.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel has a second effect that’s commonly overlooked but you can banish it from your graveyard to summon a Starry Knight from your graveyard for a lot more recursion and utility.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rayel should be played at 3 and you shouldn’t play any less than that, it does so much by providing a really good normal summon and has a built in graveyard effect that helps you in the grindgame.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Orbitael</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The newest card to be released in burst of destiny, Orbitael does it’s job and it does it well</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s really good with utility and has an ashproof search effect, to cherry top it that ashproof search is a quick effect so you can collect two spell or traps really easily.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first effect on Orbiteal is a quick effect, you can tribute a light monster and in return set one Starry Knight spell or trap from your deck, it’s really helpful for a steady stream of resources when combined with its second effect.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The reason orbiteal is probably the best starry knight card is because of the fact that it has the second effect that it has, if a level 7 light dragon you control is returned to your hand Orbiteal is able to summon itself from your graveyard instantly allowing you to recycle it and keep on gaining card advantage every turn, it doesn’t banish when summoned this way either! Despite both of these effects being hard once per turns it’s a extremely good card that you will use a lot when playing Starry Knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3 Orbiteal, it is far better than pretty much any other Starry Knight in the game at the moment and makes your life so much more easy when playing Starry Knights.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Astel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Astel has two effects, each useful in their own way</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first effect Astel provides is a quick effect to tribute a light monster to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The other effect is a graveyard effect where Astel can banish itself to provide 1000 attack to a level 7 light dragon you control, this is a quick effect and has caught players by surprise.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All Astel really does is it’s job, but that’s all I ask of it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As far as Astel goes I actually recommend 2-3, I’ve lost duels playing one Astel because I couldn’t summon Starry Dragon because I ran out of Astel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Ciel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ciel is a lightning overdrive card, it can bounce a Starry Knight or level 7 light dragon on your field back to you hand in return for summoning it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If Ciel is in your graveyard and you don’t own a monster you can banish it to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand, this effect doesn’t come up that often but it’s neat to have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The amount of Ciel played is completely up to preference but you should play at least one</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Flamel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Flamel isn’t as good as the other Starry Knights but I’ll explain this one regardless</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’re being attacked you can pitch Flamel from your hand or field to summon a level 7 light dragon from your hand. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the graveyard Flamel can banish itself to take a level 7 light dragon on your field or graveyard and return it to your hand.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Flamel is either played at 1 or cut entirely, sometimes it’s effects can help but it doesn’t push forward the strategy of your deck much, I play one for the sake of having it just in case</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Sky</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The field spell for Starry Knights, the two effects are decent</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You get to normal summon a Starry Knight or level 7 light dragon in addition to your normal summon every turn, mediocre at best</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you bounce a level 7 light dragon then Starry Sky draws you one card, resource flow is neat but Starry Knights already have a second hand in form of the graveyard</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Copies? Your choice, it’s cool but not good enough to run terraforming</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Ceremony</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can collect a level 7 light dragon with this card making it a good card alone, but summoning that money upon your opponents effect is a really helpful tool,</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 2-3 of this, it’s a great tool to have in general but you can definitely get away with 2</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Bellfire</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rota with a built in gimmick summoning effect, though there’s not much more to say about it it’s a great card in general</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Play 3, maximize on this card always, it’s your main searcher and makes Rayel able to search any Starry Knight card in the game</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Arrival</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can bounce or summon a level 7 light dragon, this trap is a really helpful card and helps you in so many ways despite how simple it is</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Run 2-3 copies of this card, it’s such a useful tool to have</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Starry Knight Blast</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">By bouncing a level 7 light dragon on your field you can negate a card which is cool but that’s all there is to say about it</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is completely up to you, I really can’t say more</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ok that’s all of the Starry Knight cards!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now for some techs to list</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Bahalutiya, the Grand Radiance:</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of if you want to play it for it’s gimmick, helps tremendously sometimes</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 barrier statue is the heavens and 3 ties of the brethren</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">90% of Starry Knight gameplay is on your opponents turn but adding in a floodgate is also super brutal.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Strengths include</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Very good at outing problem monsters like dragoon via starry dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Very resilient because of it’s second hand in form of the graveyard allowing it to take multiple negates and still play</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You get to have tons of backup options in case your first idea is negated.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Really good at control.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Weaknesses include</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A little underwhelming</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Insanely hard to pilot</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If your opponent still plays through everything you toss at them then it’ll be really hard to bring back a game</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Has to go first</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Below is the build I’m currently using, please enjoy.</span></p>"

Every Exorsister xyz monster has unique ability when they xyz summonned and they are really good at putting multiple interruptions for your opponent on their turn  <strong>Deck Description</strong>  Beside this archetype is really good at xyz summoning on your opponent's turn, they still need some conditions to actually work and create multiple interruption to prevent your opponent from doing their stuff. So if your opponent doesnt really use their graveyard, maybe just cheat some big monsters and battle like some otk strat out there, you will definitely stuck and then lose. So to prevent that, i add few engine for rank 4 xyz and most importantly is the trap card called ""Wonder XYZ"". This trap basically just allow you to xyz summon on your opponent's turn, and it has synergy with Exorsister's Trap too (Exorsister Vaids), so it will makes this Archetype more playable than before. Also i put some generic card on the side deck like kaiju and dark ruler no more for going second, and few hand traps depends on the condition. This archetype is really simple, so for the combo or gameplay, you can just learn it yourself and explore it for more.  But despite all that, this Archetype will still be very overwhelmed against Meta Deck. I hope konami will release more support for this archetype in the future."

First remember always that the Dogmatika cards block in the current turn the Despia Fusion Summons, so u need of think what to do in sequence and this deck have much combo. Second is hard to use this deck because u need of to know all the cards effects (all the cards have 2 or 3 effects) and think also the cards to send to grayeard. This is a Chaos version because 2x of BLS and BLS work great in this deck. Dramaturgia of Despia is a great card, when u fusion summon with him, go in autoreborn and if ur opponent summon a Fusion, Syncro, Xyz or Link un select a monster of opponent field and negate his effect and is level 8. Albion the Blackclad Dragon is a +1 card in hand or a level 8 special summon. Ad Libitum of Despia in a reborn if u fusion summon with him, don't is much playable how Dramaturgia, but 1x is good in a Despia Deck. Albèrt, Jester of Despia is a engine of Despia deck, when u normal or special summon him (effect Ad Libitum, effect of First Darklord, Monster reborn etc..) u can add a spell/trap Branded, is a fusion monster is crashed for battle or effect u can reborn him form GY and negate 1 effect monster. Fallen of Albaz is wonderful, with him u can fusion summon (-1 card in hand) with opponent monster and this card work great with the magic Fusion Deployment (summon form deck and fusion with oppenet monster). Despian of Tragedy is nice card because if is sent to GY , banished BY EFFECT, u can add Despia monster from Deck and u can banish this card from GY for to set a magic/trap Branded from the deck. 3x Effect Veiler is good in Despia deck because work always and is light for fusion summon. Ecclesia (Dogmatika) is engine of dogmatica, but in this deck is ok to have only 1x, with she if is special or normal summoned (special summoned also for Ecclesia effect) u can add a Dogmatica card (monster, trap, magic) and this card cannot be destroyed by battle with a monster summoned from extra deck. Dogmatika Maximus work fine because is special summoned if u remove a extra deck card in ur GY (also for this is important think what do u send in GY form Extra Deck) once per turn u and ur opponent send 2 extra deck monsters to GY. Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted is special summoned from hand, u can special summon him and negate 1 monster effect, when attack u can (for always) +500 atk all dogmatika cards. If u can, for inflict much damage, xyz summon rank 8 for number 97 (ur opponent don't can target this card), effect number 98 and special summon numebr 100, effect and 9k or more of atk. If u can and want protect u form 1 opponent magic and future attacs special summon rank 8 numebr 38. The firts of darklords is a very good card in this deck because opponent don't cat target and u can special summon from the GY one time for turn, this card work better in Despia pure version, look for my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/despia-competitive-version/"">Despia (Good Version)</a>. Despia, the Branded Theather is field card for fusion summon, you can add this card from the deck with despia effects cards and when 1 faity monster is destroyed for attack/effect you can special summon 1 level 8 fusion monster from the GY (all levels 8 fusion monsters and no only Despia!) The shaddols extra deck monsters, despia, brigrand, titaniklad ect.. have all 2nd effect that work in GY and work fine with Dogmatika cards and the trap Shaddoll Scism. Don't send to GY from extra deck Despia cards, fusion fummon 1st this cards, for example Masquerade, the Crimsongleam Dragon if fusion summoned inflick ALWAYS -600 for EVERY card your oppenet use, is normal with this card inflict from 2k to 4k of damage in only 1 turn and Despian Quaeritis every turn make atk 0 for all monsters (no fusion 8 stars) and opponent cards how Ritual Blue Eyes and much, much others are unusefull with this monsters.  Branded in Red is a nice card, but dont' is the best start with this card in hand the first turn, for this is in 1x, with this magic u add to hand 1x Despia or Fallet of Albaz card from GY and after this fusion a 8 stars or more monster, but this fusion summoned monster don't can direct attack (no FTK), but for example if u summon Albion the Branded Dragon u can continue with another fusion summon without limitations for attacks, or fusion summon the card u need without direct attack. I remember (again) that is very important to know in perfect mode all the affects of extra deck (also normal deck ok..) for use this Despia Deck. Test is and u will see how work fine. I accept (after u have tested the deck) all suggestions. TYVM for all."

The purpose of these cards is to fuse into annoying boss monsters with a single card, Aleister the Invoker. You search for Aleister with the Magical Meltdown, and on normal summon he searches an Invocation, which is like a Miracle Fusion for Invoked monsters. You can then link him into a Magistus woman or Almiraj (the first 2 ED cards) and fuse them into an Invoked fusion monster (the next 4 ED cards). This should bait out some disruption and you can move to...  <strong>Step 2: Do Dogmatika Stuff</strong>  The <strong>Dogmatika</strong> engine is 3 Dogmatika Ecclesia, 1 Dogmatika FleurdeLis, and 1 Dogmatika Nexus, 3 Nadhir Servant, and 1 Dogmatika Punishment. The purpose of these cards is to (1) dump cards from the extra deck for spot removal and (2) search disruption. Ecclesia can be normal or specialed if there's an ED monster on the field, and on summon can search one of the Fleur de Lis, Nexus, or Punishment, which are a Veiler, double extra dump, and Raigeki Break, respectively. The cards to dump are the next 5 cards, and do stuff like searching, popping, and reactive removal. If you didn't open the Nadhir Servant or couldn't summon Ecclesia, you can move to...  <strong>Step 3: Do Eldlich Stuff</strong>  The <strong>Eldlich/Golden Land</strong> cards are the backbone of this deck. As in, even if you're hit with a bunch of disruption, you'll always have Eldlich stuff to do. The idea is that you summon (1) Eldlich the Golden Lord with Scarlet Sanguine, or with its own effect, (2) use the Golden Land continuous traps as disruption (specifically a Raigeki Break and D.D. Crow) and (3) banish the Golden Land and Scarlet Sanguines from the grave to set the other from the deck. Just a nice, consistent resource loop to fall back on. The last 2 ED cards are for Eldlich and are a pseudo-cowboy, a way to get a Golden Land trap from hand to GY, a way to get a Golden Land trap from field to GY, and a beefy boy.  <strong>Gotchas:</strong> <ol>  	<li>While you have Cursed Eldland up, you can only attack with zombies, so it's common to use big boy Eldlich's in-hand effect to pop it.</li>  	<li>A lot of summoning restrictions <ol>  	<li>After you resolve Ecclesia or Nadhir Servant, you can't summon from the ED <em>for the rest of the turn</em>.</li>  	<li>After you resolve Dogmatika Punishment, you can't summon from the ED until the <em>end of your</em> <em>next</em> <em>turn.</em></li>  	<li>After you resolve Scarlet Sanguine, you can only summon zombies for the <em>rest of the turn</em>. Don't wanna make any illegal summons.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>"

Sadly, Zombie World deck is one of the main counters to this deck strategy because it makes all the cards turn into Zombie monsters.  I usually use Urgent Schedule as soon as possible to bring Super Express Bullet Train and Infinitrack Harvester, then link Infinitrack Goliath using Harvester in order to send it to the graveyard and use Infinitrack Trencher on my Graveyard (if able) to bring back Infinitrack Harvester and use its effect to mix its level with Super Express Bullet Train and get 2 level 12 monsters to XYZ summon Number 77: Seven Sins, or ZEUS, but I prefer Seven Sins because Zeus is easier to summon just by using a low rank XYZ monster like Gear X Gigant.  Also we can use Machine Duplication to multiply the number of Harvesters instead of sending it to the Graveyard, in order to have more monsters to tribute and activate effects. There are many strategies to play in this deck, but I will let you find them out. (I need to work so I can't stay for long writing, sorry)."

Magician Salvation is good for getting Eternal Soul on the field without Dark Magical Circle, and Illusion of Chaos helps unbrick your hand and get you Magician's Rod or Magicians' Souls.  &nbsp;  Your goal here is to go first and sit on either Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or Illusion of Chaos --Ideally both. And this deck can consistently summon on both of them in one turn. It also has one copy of Sauravis in case your opponent tries to use Veiler or Imperm on your monsters, and one copy of Dark Magic Attack because Trap decks are the spawn of Satan."

The archtype’s strategy caught my eyes because it resembles a lot of link plays, two monsters to make one. The only problem that I have with this strategy is speed, only because it is an old strategy in a modern format. So the tri-brigade in conjunction with the test panther are here to make this deck great once again like the Roman Empire (probably will fall too hehehe).</span>  <span><b>Inside The Gladiator's field:</b></span>  <span><span>The final goal with the gladiator beast’s strategy is to make a final board with </span><b>“<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>”, “<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>”</b> and<b> “<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>” or “<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>”, “<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>” </b>and the<b> “<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>”</b><span>. These two boards are decent, each one in its one way.  The first one gives you 4 to 5 monster’s negates (3 to 4 by Apollousa and one by Domitianus) and one spell/trap negate (Heraklinos). The second one can give you one monster negate plus a lock down in a form that negates every monster’s summons but wind ones.</span></span>  <span><span>To make this board, the vital piece is “</span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span>''. Why? You can ask me and I will happily answer. The role of this piece is to search any gladiator card: it can be a monster that is missing, a spell to extend or the only trap for the next turn. This card effect goes even further, shuffling a gladiator beast monster to search for another one. This effect counts as summoning by a gladiator beast effect, so any gladiator beast’s effect that needs this to activate will activate. With that being said let’s go to combos:</span></span>  <span><span>First of all, </span><b><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Kerass"">Tri-Brigade Kerass</a></b><span> or any other tri-brigade need to hit the field. It can be easily fulfilled by the normal tri-brigade combo. Second, a gladiator beast needs to be on field too. For that, </span><b>3x <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a></b> <span>plus the normal monster support like</span><b> <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> </b><span>are here to speed things up. With this set up, </span><b>Kerass</b><span> will cheat </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> from the extra deck, so it can search any Gladiator beast’s card, preferably </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>. </b><span> After that, Test Phanter’s second effect can shuffle the Andal or any other gladiator beast to summon any gladiator beast ,counting as a summon by a gladiator beast’s effect. Soo, counting as you searched </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>,</b><span> you need to summon </span><b></b><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Gladiator Beast Augustus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;""><b>Gladiator Beast Augustus</b><span>,</span></a><span> in this way by the effect of him </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a> </b><span>will be summoned, dropping (by her effect) in the GY </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a></b><span>, gaining his name and level.</span></span>  <span><span>With two level 5 or more Gladiatores Beasts on field, by contact fusion, </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></b><span> can hit the field. He can cheat any fusion Gladiator Beast, soft once per turn. This is a good way to do what you need to do:</span></span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span> If you want to destroy any card  you can bring </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a> </b><span>(destroys two card on the field upon summon)</span><b>,</b><span> using him and </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> to bring </span><b><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>, </b><span> locking the opponent with  the </span><b><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>;</b></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span>If you want bring as much negation as possible and have </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a> </b><span> in the hand you can summon </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a> </b><span>(one monster negate and a body of 3500), using </span><b>Kerass</b><span>, </span><b>Tamer Editor </b><span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Phanter</a> </b><span>as link material for</span><b> “<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>” </b><span>will have 3 negates, after that resurrecting </span><b>Tamer Editor</b><span> with  </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback, </a></b>you can cheat<b> <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>, </b><span>to finish the board;</span></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span>If you want lock plus one negate you can bring </span><b><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>,</b><span> using </span><b><a data-name=""Test Phanter"">Test Panther</a></b><span> and Nerval to bring </span><b><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>,</b><span> locking the opponent with the </span><b><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>.</b></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""></li> </ul> <span><b>For the Tri Brigade battle:</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Tri Brigade Combo is simple as everybody already knows.

Generate tons of res,"Normal Pendulum combines the power of the “normal” monster support racked up over the years with the power of pendulum summoning! This deck is a casual budget deck (about $30 without the non-mandatory expensive cards) that is easy to use, has a lot of future potential and customizable to your liking. Normal Pendulum functions as a swarmy beatdown deck that can generate resources constantly and summon gigantic boss monsters every turn.  &nbsp;  The<span> <strong><u>BREAD AND BUTTER COMBO</u></strong></span> for this deck turbos out Draco Masters of the Tenyi, which gives you 3 link arrows to use for a pendulum summon. Once you pendulum summon using Draco Master's link arrows, you can create your board from there, depending on the situation. After establishing your scales of 2 and 7, this combo requires only two cards, Hallohallo, and a level 4 normal monster/Unexpected Dai. <ol>  	<li>Get a normal monster other than Hallohallo on the field (either by normal summoning it or using Unexpected Dai).</li>  	<li>Link summon Link Spider with your normal monster.</li>  	<li>Activate Link Spider’s effect to summon Hallohallo to it’s link arrow.</li>  	<li>Link both for Halqifibrax, summoning another Hallohallo.</li>  	<li>Link Halqifibrax and Hallohallo to summon Draco Masters of the Tenyi. Now you have three link arrows to pendulum summon!</li>  	<li>Pendulum summon both Hallohallos and your level 4 monster from your ED, as well as any other left over monsters in your hand. Now you can make your board however you like according to your situation.</li> </ol> My favourite endboard going first is Avramax + Moonlight Dragon, giving you protection with a beefy hard to kill boss and a monster bounce. Going second, once you summon Draco Masters you can pop 3+ effect monsters due to your army of normal monsters on the field, then you can OTK once you clear their board!  If you have extenders or additional material on the board, you can potentially make a 4 material Apollousa complete with Black Rose Moonlight Dragon/Stellar Wind Wolfrayet/Tornado Dragon. You also can put all your eggs in one basket and potentially make a 4000-6000 attack Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, practically ensuring your link arrows for next turn's pendulum summon.  The end boards possible for this deck is extremely variable. Be creative!  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum features 6 <span><strong>DRAW CARDS</strong></span> specific to normal monsters that can + like crazy, giving this deck a lot of resource generation which allows you to catch up to other players despite your weaker cards.  <strong>Shatter the Darkness</strong> (unreleased card, current “earthshattering event"" in my list as a placeholder) gives you a draw once per turn when you summon a normal monster. It also has very beneficial effects for your level 5+ normal pendulums and Extra Deck monsters using normal monsters as material, turning them into beatsticks with it’s “Honest” like attack boost effect!  <strong>Heart of the Underdog</strong> is an ancient card that is not once per turn. This deck features 22 normal monsters, so this card can draw you many cards in one go! This card can also be used in multiples in the field, so the effect stacks allowing for more draw power! It’s not unusual for this card to allow the player +3 or +4 card advantage during their draw phase!  <strong>Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</strong> turns your normal monsters into mini “towers” rendering them UNAFFECTED by monster effects. Also, this modern age of Yugioh basically guarantees an opponent special summon an effect monster so you can draw two cards easily. Consider this card a pot of Greed that provides monster protection.  &nbsp;  Nine<span><strong> CONSISTENCY CARDS</strong></span> tailored to support normal monsters ensure that you never brick with this deck (in playtesting I’ve only bricked once in 20-ish games). If you’re missing proper pendulum scales, search for it! Need Hallo-Hallo or a level 4 normal monster for the combo? Add it from the deck or summon it!  <strong>Painful Decision</strong> is ROTA on crack for normal monsters, since it’s also a foolish burial. Throwing a normal monster in the graveyard enables more destruction ability for Draco Masters of the Tenyi which depends on normal monsters in the GY.  <strong>Summoner’s Art</strong> is simple, adds a level 5 or high normal monster to the hand. Ideally, you’d want Sky Dragoons of Draconia as your pendulum scale 7 since it’s pendulum effect of card destruction is very helpful.  <strong>Unexpected Dai</strong> summons from the deck a normal monster. If you’re missing either part of the bread and butter combo, summon it! If you already have both of them, this acts as an extender, netting you a 4 material Apollousa, 5000 attack Arrival Cyberse, etc.  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum features a army of 22 <span><strong>NORMAL MONSTERS</strong></span> which are all Pendulum monsters. Make sure you set the scales 2 and 7, and pendulum your way to victory! Many of these monsters have pendulum effects that are relevant to your normal monsters:  <strong>Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect adds any normal monster from your deck to your hand if your normal monster destroys an opponent’s monster by battle.  <strong>Sky Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect target destroys 1 card on the field when your normal monster inflicts damage.  <strong>Sea Dragoons of Draconia</strong>’s pendulum effect summons a normal monster from your hand if a monster is destroyed by battle. I only opted to use 1 of this card because it’s effect isn’t useful most of the time since your hand tends to never have monsters anymore. Also level 3 isn’t a very good level for making synchros and XYZ in this deck.  <strong>Dragon Horn Hunter</strong>’s pendulum effect boosts your normal monster’s attack by 200. Every normal monster cannot be destroyed by battle.  <strong>Lancephorhychus</strong>’s pendulum effect gives all your normal monsters piercing verses defense position monsters.  Other relevant pendulum effects:  <strong>Foucault’s Cannon</strong>’s pendulum effect is this deck’s backrow destruction.  <strong>Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA</strong>’s pendulum effect is extremely strong, banishing every spell and trap that is sent to the graveyard. This free to summon effect monster also is very nasty going first. This card sends every single monster summoned while it is on the field during the end phase, even if it leaves the field, disrupting combos and set-ups the opponent tries to make. This card is slightly not budget friendly, so it can be replaced by Rescue Rabbit, which works very well too.  &nbsp;  Normal Pendulum is very good at generating materials necessary to summon a lot of extra deck <span><strong>BOSS MONSTERS</strong></span> to the field, due to the pendulum summoning mechanic and card nigh broken drawing ability for normal monster support. They’re mostly self-explanatory, but here are my favourites to summon in this deck:  <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong> functions as the “towers” for the deck. Since he is so difficult to remove (especially with the support of I:P Masquerena) your link arrows for pendulum summoning are fairly safe with him around.  <strong>The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</strong> can also be turbo’d out first turn in this deck as a 4000 ATK monster (just make sure you have 4 attributes when you pendulum summon)! This deck features all 6 attributes, so you can potentially make a 6000 attack final boss monster. Your opponent generally cannot out this monster, and you straight up win.  <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> and <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</strong> are the go-to dragons in this deck, depending on the situation. Rose Dragon is ideal going first, allowing the player to potentially disrupt a combo by bouncing a key monster. Cyberse Quantum Dragon is better going second, breaking apart boards with the bounce effect in the battle phase as well as attacking twice.  <strong>Unchained Abomination</strong> RIP AND TEARS boards apart with it’s rage! Nuff’ said.  <strong>Dhampir Vampire Sheridan</strong> is my personal pick since this deck has easy access to rank 6 toolbox. It’s the best Rank 6 monster in my opinion, allowing for a targeted send removal + an ability to monster reborn your opponent’s strong monster.  &nbsp;  The <strong><span>SIDE DECK </span></strong><span>features other cards that once can potentially use in the deck to change playstyle or for budget options. </span>  <span><strong>Skill Drain, Heat Wave Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi (Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon can be summoned with this card),</strong> and <strong>Tyrant's Throes</strong> allow for a more ""stun"" focused playstyle of this deck. I chose not to use them, since I like to play aggressively. Feel free to use these cards in your version of the deck!</span>  <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong> is a good budget replacement for Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA and it works very well, generating resources and increasing consistency. <strong>Denko Sekka</strong> is also a good budget replacement, since this deck does not really normal summon much.  <strong>Lyna the Light Charmer, Magician of Hope, Majester Paladin</strong> and <strong>World Gears</strong> are perfect budget options to replace the more expensive monsters in the extra deck like Halqifibrax, Apollousa and Avramax.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</span> </strong>  I have a confession to make, I’m one of those weirdos who <strong><em>HATED</em> </strong>the pendulum mechanic for “ruining” Yu-Gi-Oh, especially during the infamous PEPE format. This is my first ever pendulum deck I’m making and getting IRL, so it’s kind of a funny apology to all the hate I’ve unjustly dished out to pendulum over the years. I was a close minded Yugi-Boomer with nostalgia tinted glasses at the time, forgive me pendulum enthusiasts.  Anyways, this deck was super fun to make and playtest! Since it’s a non-archetypal deck, it reminded me of making a deck when I bought packs as a little kid and smushing every sort of card together into a deck until it functions (badly lol). It’s also pretty cool since everything comes together and actually works out! Normal Pendulum is super customizable too, and I made this deck the way I like playing Yugioh – boss monster turbo beatdown (that doesn’t involve long combos).  There is so much support coming out for normal monsters with Magikey, Tenyi, Token, Blue-Eyes/Dark Magician stuff coming out, so this deck has upwards potential. All in all, Normal Pendulum is a fun casual budget deck that is easy to use for those new to the pendulum mechanic.

For those of you who want to have a FUN game of Yu-Gi-Oh, or are broke as fuck like me, welcome back.  Compared to the version I made back in April, this deck has gone through a few alterations now that a couple of cards have come out. For starters, the link engine I ran has changed from Evil Eye to the much better and more versatile Scrap engine. This gives the deck some access to a few level 9 Synchro plays that do see their play from time to time. If you want some level 8s I recommend against it, as you always want to use the scrap engine to get out your Artifact Dagda, otherwise you'll struggle getting enough Artifacts onto the board. I've also replaced the 3 Varja with the much better Beagalltach. This give you much more control over what you want to pop, as we've now geared to a much more trap heavy lineup. Whilst Varja was explosive, I often found myself popping too many of my useful traps, so the change is much more useful with the slightly reduced Artifact lineup. To improve consistency, I've added 3 Pot Of Duality which are very helpful in a starting hand and if you do draw them later, can prove their use when you've Xyz Summoned and are just looking for more plays in the late game. MST has been replaced with the much more useful Heavy Storm Duster. I often found that MST was not giving me enough mileage, as I would have to choose between my opponents backrow or my own Artifacts to trigger. HSD allows you to get more bang for your buck, with both triggering your Artifact effects, but also giving you the option to pop your opponents backrow if need be. The battle phase skip is nothing to worry about, as you'll only every activate it on your opponents turn anyway. I've also rejigged the Artifact lineup slightly, utilising a slightly smaller number and only 1 of the 'other' Artifacts that I deemed useful. I also replaced Fail naught with Mjolnir as it just gives you quicker access to you Artifacts' effects, rather than having to wait a turn to pop them. The lock in to Artifacts is not too bad, as you'll only really be activating it late game to bring back one back. In replace of Breakthrough Skill is the outright denial in Solemn Strike. Hand traps ruin my fun and I'm not having it, no sireee no. The Xyz lineup has also slightly changed, some cards have fallen out, whilst others have come in for reasons you can probably guess.  And there u have it. My pure Artifact deck 2.0 As always, any feedback or tips you guys have is always appreciate, hope you guys enjoyed."

But they don't see any play in the meta (and will never see play). This deck ","Without a doubt, Ancient Gears are one of the most powerful OTK decks... But they don't see any play. This deck profile is meant for those who want to bring AG to the spotlight and win.  Of course, they're not built for the meta, but their ability to obliterate decks in a single turn is funny. I used to play <em>a lot</em> of Kaijus to remove annoying cards on the board, but I dropped the number down a little to see more of my fusion and special summoning spell cards. The main play strategy is revolved around bringing out the big fusion monsters for quick and brutal finishes, and one of the most powerful combos of doing that is with Ancient Gear Catapult.  Ancient Gear Catapult is amazing for being able to pop either one of your main piece spell cards, Geartown or Ancient Gear Fortress, or act as a bait to ensure your fusion or searching plays. Destroying a spell card with Ancient Gear Catapult allows you to special summon one Ancient Gear monster from your deck <em>ignoring its summoning conditions</em>. If you pop Geartown or Fortress, it's better to bring out the classical Ancient Gear Golem or the new one (Ultimate Pound), because the Field and Continuous Spell allow you to summon out your regular Ancient Gear cards, like Wyvern or Frame.  The usual play on your OTK turn is having no monsters on your field, with Catapult and either Geartown or Fortress in hand. Activate the Field Spell or Continuous spell cards first, then destroy them with Catapult to summon out Ancient Gear Golem or Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound. Geartown/Fortress's effects activate after their destruction, so use them to Special Summon Ancient Gear Wyvern to the field. Once Wyvern is summoned, use its effect to add Ancient Gear Box to hand, which will activate once it's searched from your deck to add Ancient Gear Frame to your hand. If you have a Fusion/Polymerization Spell Card in hand after all of that, immediately fusion summon into big finishers. If you do not have a spell card to Fusion Summon, instead of grabbing Ancient Gear Box with Wyvern's effect, add Ancient Gear Hunting Hound or Ancient Gear Fusion from your deck, which will allow you to access your fusions.  Before those plays, if you have a Kaiju in hand, you can rip away an annoying monster on their board with it. After that, proceed with the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo.  Of course, there are situations where you are going second, and you don't have Catapult and/or Geartown/Fortress. Luckily, there are Fusion Spell cards like Power Bond or Ancient Gear Fusion to draw into, and enough Ancient Gear monsters to allow you to play. Overload Fusion is great after you either use all of your monsters to already fuse, or they were all sent to the graveyard by your opponent.  Two Limiter Removals ensure that you get over big monsters and still be able to win with one attack.  Going first is a bad time for Ancient Gears, a majority of the time. So, I put in three Ancient Gear Howitzers, one Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, and one Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon for protection and increasing survivability chances after your first turn. Bringing them out is easy with Fusion Spell cards, and the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo.  Sad thing about the Xyz plays is that Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is a Level 9, but the card is great going second for OTKs and for removing backrow to ensure Main Phase 2 combos on turn 2.  Ancient Gear Ballista is in here because it's like another Catapult for going second, but it requires you to have two EARTH Machine Monsters already on the field. It's easy to do that if you do the Catapult + Geartown/Fortress combo first, and then if you have an extra Geartown/Fortress, destroy it with Ballista to keep extending and <em>really</em> ensure that OTK.  Ancient Gears will never be meta, and will never see meta play, but the gameplay of the deck is so much fun. It's just generate big numbers with absurd effects behind them, and swing for game in one turn. This deck profile and strategy is just for those who want to experience the same joys as I and my friends do playing this deck."

This deck can obviously play going first or second, but with Trap Trick and Red Reign, it's better to go first, especially since Red Supernova is a powerful negate the nukes the opponent's board.  There is another going first strategy with the side deck cards. Siding in the Synchro Calls in place of the Infinite Imperms allows the player to set up a first turn where they have the ability to synchro summon into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on their opponent's turn and literally make them unable to play. Simply, the first turn end board is having Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend and two Creation Resonators (brought out by Crimson Resonator) sit in the monster zones, with Synchro Call sitting in the backrow (or Trap Trick to set Synchro Call on your opponent's turn) and ready to bring out your Red Rising Dragon from graveyard to immediately go into King Calamity.  The Clear Wing and Crystal Wing package is helpful in some scenarios and intended strategies, so I had them be placed in the side deck. The reason why they're not in the extra deck is because Red Rising Dragon's ability to revive Resonators locks the player into only synchro summoning DARK Dragon Synchro monsters for the rest of the turn, and it's a lot better to have Red Supernova (generated by Red Rising reviving Crimson Resonator from the graveyard) be your first synchro summon. However, there are obviously situations where you can't synchro climb through even numbers, and being locked into DARK Dragons leaves you the safe and ensured option of going to Ancient Pixie Dragon. Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth is also there as a Level 5 option, but it's also alright to run the Speedroid Level 5 synchro, too.  I've thought of playing the Rokket Synchro package to bust out more synchro monsters, but in today's meta, Hand Traps are definitely needed. Three of Ash Blossom, Three of Ghost Ogre, and Three of Infinite Imperm helped me play out of certain combo decks and allowed me to survive longer till I achieved victory, but three (or whatever proportions) of other hand traps is fine to play in this deck.  I don't focus on Link strategies in this deck, and of course I have ran into hilarious situations where I could have made certain Links if I put them into the deck, but those are <em>very rare</em> opportunities.  Red Dragon Archfiends will never be meta, but their extra deck cards have seen play in those high levels of gameplay. I've always loved RDAs and the purity of it with the Resonators and other Jack Atlas support, so I bring this deck to those to have the same joys and interests."

The Deck uses a small <a data-name=""Super Polimerization"">Super Polimerization</a> engine made of <a data-name=""Predaplant Anaconda Verte"">Predaplant Anaconda Verte</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, plus all the usual targets, including <a data-name=""First of the Dragon"">First of the Dragon</a>, very easy to make and can quit the duel.  The true core of the deck is <a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat"">Number 29: Mannequin Cat, which can summon any monster from Deck, Hand or GY, if </a><a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> is on the field. In order to make Number 29, we will use </a><a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> and the Sacred Beast engine. </a><a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat""> takes the place of </a><a data-name=""Legendary Maju Garzett"">Legendary Maju Garzett</a><a data-name=""Number 29: Mannequin Cat"">, being in addition searchable also by </a><a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked Warden"">Ahrima, The Wicked Warden, and it can tribute to OTK and generates a level 1 token for our </a><a data-name=""Ahrima, The Wicked Warden"">Linkuriboh.</a>  The Deck finds very good follow up cards in <a data-name=""Recurring Knightmare"">Recurring Knightmare</a> (which I am very happy to be able to play here) and <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a>. These two cards can recurr a Linkuriboh, a Number 29, therefore any monster from everywhere, including the floodgate <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abiss"">Barrier Statue of the Abiss</a>.  The Deck is completed by one <a data-name=""Capshell"">Capshell</a>, in order to have some recurrable draw power, <a data-name=""Lost paradise"">Lost paradise</a>, more draw power, <a data-name=""Diabolos, Lord of The Lair"">Diabolos, Lord of The Lair</a>, just because it's great, and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> plus <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>.  The use of <a data-name=""Mind Crash"">Mind Crash</a> is in my opinion mandatory, since it can be chained at <a data-name=""Crash Card Virus"">Crash Card Virus</a> or Epidemic Eradicator Virus to Complete the hand control opera. Basically any monster and the tokens are good fodders for CCV and all our big beaters, but also the super poly targets, are good for EEV.  I hope you will enjoy this version. I have many others, but I think this one is the one that will benefit the most from <a data-name=""Piris Reis Map"">Piris Reis Map</a> and <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> once they are available.  Since the Deck is very weak on banishing, you may consider to add three <a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Chaos Hunter</a> in the Side Deck, maybe in place of <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>.

While the Despia package slightly boost consistency as their Field Spell; it doesn't orchestrate the consistency of the deck, but rather carries the deck when no fusion spells are present in your hand; need a monster like Shaddoll Winda or Invoked Caliga for locking your opponent during the next turn; or you want to go an extra mile to expand your board. The Dino package also acts as fusion fodder and fuel to Special Summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, and link summon into Verte Anaconda (Especially with Giant Rex + Gold Sarcophagus). The Dragoon package is also present for OTK validation, negate wall (when paired with Invoked Mechaba or Shaddoll Shekhinaga), etc. As for Pot of Desires, I chose to play that over Allure of Darkness simply because I don't entirely need my whole deck to achieve necessary board building results."

Essentially the aim is to go second and break the opponent's board with the many powerful blowout cards such as Raigeki and Harpie's Feather Duster, following up with a Suship board providing either a swift OTK or a close OTK with either a Zeus or negate+steal.  <strong>Main Deck Card Choices</strong> <ul>  	<li>3 of each Suship - 3 of all the Suship monsters allows max consistency.</li>  	<li>3 Rescue Rabbit and 3 Unexpected Dai - act functionally as 6 extra copies of Rice Suship for bonus consistency, or for extending combos allowing multiple xyz plays.</li>  	<li>3 Effect Veiler - bare minimum handtrap I used as a cheap version of Infinite Impermanence; feel free to replace with whatever handtrap you feel works best.</li>  	<li>3 Alpha - breaks tough boards going second by skirting around protection effects. Also good at soaking up a negate so you can make Suship plays.</li>  	<li>3 Parallel EXeed - very good card to use for extending further with XYZ plays or as link fodder. You usually summon this off of a spare Rice Suship linked into a Link Spider.</li>  	<li>3 Suship Field Spell, 1 Suship Trap - I feel this ratio works nicely as you will hit the field spell a lot when drawing allowing extended plays, and the trap card is searchable afterwards for recycling and setting up for a turn 4. The duels usually don't last long enough for more than 1 of the trap to resolve and so I don't feel another is necessary.</li>  	<li>2 Desires, 1 Upstart - 2 Desires so you see it but don't draw it enough to banish everything: banishing any number of Rice Suship is devastating as there is no in-engine way to recur them. Upstart for 39 card deck consistency, the extra LP should not be a problem with the damage you can output.</li>  	<li>1 Monster reborn - it's useful sometimes, whether it's used for stealing a dragoon or recycling a Suship.</li>  	<li>Blowouts: 3 Dark Ruler, HFD, Raigeki [Optionally you can run 3 Dark Hole if you don't mind cutting Veiler, or even adding 3 Lightning Storm over Alpha or the field spell] - break boards, win games.</li> </ul> <strong>Extra Deck Card Choices</strong> <ul>  	<li>2 of each Suship XYZ - these will never be summoned more than twice.</li>  	<li>2 Zeus - broken card, clears the field of anything you can't out, turns a dead Suship XYZ after the battle phase into a powerful interruption. Unlikely more than 2 will come up.</li>  	<li>Number F0 - Utopic Future and Number F0 - Utopic Future Dragon - mostly used as a turn 1 play if you are made to go first as a way to set up an interruption with protection. Negates and steals a monster with no downsides up to 3 times (OPT). Can be used instead of Zeus as an option in Main Phase 2 if you don't want to wipe your field.</li>  	<li>Link Spider - Rice Suship --&gt; Link Spider --&gt; 2 Parallel EXceed</li>  	<li>I:P Masquerena and Knightmare Unicorn - standard 3 card interruption engine if you have nothing else; simply end on I:P and a monster then you can quick effect bounce to interrupt an opponent's play, which can sometimes end their turn.</li>  	<li>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops - many decks just cannot out this card and its powerful, annoying effect. A 3rd option to end a board on after dealing damage.</li>  	<li>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World - very nice removal card that Suship can easily make with their strong swarming game. It can sometimes win games on its own, but it is very situational so feel free to replace with an Apollousa or something.</li> </ul> For the side deck, consider kaijus as they can out anything your Suships or spells can't. Floodgates like Anti-Spell Fragrance, Imperial Order, etc work nicely too as the deck isn't too reliant on spells past its own turn. Floodgates are especially nice to replace the destruction staples/Dark Ruler if your opponent makes you go first. Overall though it is best to prepare your own sidedeck tailored to your own need with the deck and your local meta.  As for lines of play, the basic plays are very simple and can be figured out in a few test hands. The goal of the deck is to make the Suship XYZ monsters with Rice Suship and the respective topping Suship as materials for maximum advantage. Ending on the Rank 5 Suship, the Icefish XYZ Suship, and Zeus would be an optimal end board for example. There are some small pieces of knowledge that are harder to work out which I will list below: <ul>  	<li>Urchin Suship can shuffle Spells and Traps to summon itself, which can be used to get it out and put a dead field spell back in the deck.</li>  	<li>Try not to end your board with the Roe Suship XYZ (the red one) as it has no useful effects on your opponents turn, while the Icefish XYZ offers destruction protection and an attack buff.</li>  	<li>Multiple Icefish XYZ' buff effects stack , which can provide your field with a much larger OTK potential.</li>  	<li>Urchin Suship can target itself.</li>  	<li>Pot of Desires is very risky in this deck - don't use it unless you really need the extra cards as you risk making your deck unplayable.</li>  	<li>Likewise, Dark Ruler No More, while helping you establish a board, stops you from dealing damage and actually winning, which Suships need to do as fast as possible before they get crushed by a higher tier deck. So while it is nice to negate a field, try to use it as a last resort in this deck. Alpha can bait out negates at a much lower cost.</li> </ul> Thank you for reading and I hope you will enjoy the unique and fun style of gameplay Suship offers!"

Their art is unique, and they've got some powerful mechanics to play around with. Unfortunately, unlike Subterror or Krawler World Legacy, they've never been good enough to see widespread play. Now, with the release of Dawn of Majesty, and Tindangle Jhrelth's arrival to the TCG, I believe Tindangle's ready to join the ranks of Yu-Gi-Oh's most memorable Flip archetypes!  <hr />  <strong>Deck Composition</strong>  With Jhrelth and Dholes available to the TCG, Tindangle has become a self-reliant archetype. As such, the main deck features almost no Tindangle-specific monsters (Danger!? Tsuchinoko? is an exception), Spells, or Traps. On the contrary, the Extra Deck is a mix of generic options. While Acute Cerberus is run at three, he's a poor boss monster that's much more useful as an extender. Before we discuss strategy, let's take a moment to go over some of the best cards present in this deck!  Hand Traps: <ul>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> - No surprises here. This isn't a meta deck, so I've sacrificed room for hand traps in favor of cards that make the entire deck more consistent.</li> </ul> Draw Power: <ul>  	<li>2X <a data-name=""Tindangle Protector"">Tindangle Protector</a> - He's not the best, but he's worth mentioning. Flip him at the right time, with the right combination of set monsters, and you can easily turn some games around.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, 3X <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>, 1X <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a>, 1X <a data-name=""Into the Void"">Into the Void</a> - All fantastic choices. Each of these Spells gives you more cards in your hand, filling your Graveyard at the same time.</li> </ul> Main Deck MVP's: <ul>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> - Draw a card, or fill the Graveyard. Either choice is good!</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Dholes"">Tindangle Dholes</a> - Being a Level 5 monster, it's less than ideal to draw Dholes. However, he's incredibly powerful in conjunction with Jhrelth, and he's the reason I no longer run Foolish Burial Goods in my Tindangle decks.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Jhrelth"">Tindangle Jhrelth</a> - He's the monster that makes Tindangle decks run smoothly. Fast to play, with fantastic effects (Including the ability to self-summon), Jhrelth is the Tindangle support that we've been dreaming about.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Delaunay"">Tindangle Delaunay</a> - Tindangle's most powerful card, Delaunay shines brightest in the Graveyard. By constantly populating your field with monsters, Delaunay enables the deck to spam powerful Link monsters.</li> </ul> Extra Deck MVP's: <ul>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a> - With so many Level 4 monsters, it'd be a crime to not run at least one Xyz monster. Exciton is my go-to, but I'm sure there are more synergistic choices.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Fiendess"">Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</a> - Sees play in every decent Tindangle deck. Many decks run her at two or three, but I don't find myself summoning her often enough to merit that sort of inclusion.</li>  	<li>3X <a data-name=""Tindangle Acute Cerberus"">Tindangle Acute Cerberus</a> - While he's very easy to summon, he's an awful boss monster (No built-in protection, he's a ""beatstick"" that caps itself at 4,000 ATK). However, with his ability to summon a Tindangle Token after declaring an attack, he's a perfect extender for Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax or Unchained Abomination.</li>  	<li>1X <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a> - In my opinion, an absolute must-have  for any Tindangle deck, primarily due to his easy summoning conditions.</li> </ul> Notable Exclusions: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Stairs of Mail"">Stairs of Mail</a> - Decent support, but, for it's effect, it's not worth the space. I'd rather maximize on Tindangle's monster effects.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Spirit of the Fall Wind"">Spirit of the Fall Wind</a> - I see this card run at three in a lot of Tindangle decks. I don't get it. It's too slow, doesn't synergize well, and has to be Normal Summoned to use its effect, leaving you more vulnerable to attack. Avoid this one!</li> </ul>  <hr />  <strong>Strategy</strong>  Tindangle is a Link-spam deck that utilizes the Graveyard as a second deck. After a turn or two, you'll be able to put out a Link-4 monster every turn, with material to spare for a Link-2, or setup for the next turn. While it's relatively slow to play, Tindangle excels at filling the Graveyard in a short amount of time.  In terms of combos, there's not much to discuss. Tindangle monster effects are simple to understand; Once you've got them memorized according to monster, you'll be able to figure what to send to the Graveyard at a moment's notice. Here's an example of how Tindangle monsters work together:  Combo 1 (Dholes, Jhrelth in hand; Trinity, Intruder in Graveyard): <ol>  	<li>Activate Jhrelth's effect; Discard Dholes, send Delaunay to Graveyard.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Jhrelth; Intruder's effect activates; Chain Dholes, select Trinity.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Trinity, resolving Dholes's effect; Special Summon Intruder.</li>  	<li>Result: Jhrelth, Trinity, Intruder face-down on the field; Delaunay in the Graveyard.</li> </ol> Tindangle monster cards love to work together, and each brings a little to the table; Mill a monster, mill a Spell or a Trap, Special Summon from your Graveyard, or search a Tindangle card. Once you get the ball rolling, you'll find a good chunk of your Extra Deck out on the field, bringing the pain to your opponent... Good hunting!  <hr />  <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <ul>  	<li>Experiment with your Extra Deck composition. I've seen everything from Code Talker's to Topologic's... Have fun with it!</li>  	<li>Even being non-meta, this deck runs quite a few expensive cards (Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Danger!? Tsuchinoko?, I:P Masquerena, and Underworld Goddess of the Closed World are among the most costly). If you're looking to play this deck purely for fun, I'd highly suggest giving Magical Hats a try! It's a funny little Trap that helps put Spells and Traps into the Graveyard.</li>  	<li>If you're trying to play a Trap-heavy Tindangle deck, the Fiend Griefing engine is a must.
