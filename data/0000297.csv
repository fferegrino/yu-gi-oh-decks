This fan favourite and Starwars/Wizard of Oz themed deck returns as one of the dominant going-second strategies of the Extra Zero Event! This deck's strategy is to blind second, clear the board with board-breakers and summon giant spaceships to OTK your opponent! This deck easily OTKs with the correct cards in hand, especially with Kozmo Farmgirl or Emergency Teleport. Kozmo can also play a very competent grindgame as each monster floats into another as long as they're destroyed, allowing the pilot to beat grindy control decks like Eldlich and Flundereeze.

Play it if you want to make people sad,"  &nbsp;  <strong>Watch video for games!</strong>  This deck is deceptively powerful. You will have the upper hand vs alot of the meta picks during this tournament especially Floo, but not limited to all back row decks including true draco. The decks goal is to put your opponent in a permanent stun lock of <a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus , This will Ultimately cause the opponent to rage quit or have 0 % chance of winning with all their spells and traps being rendered useless. Now how do we get this lock going?</a>  Its simple, We need <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a> and we need <a data-name=""Malice, Lady Of Lament"">Malice, Lady Of Lament</a> and finally we need <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> . This will allow you to spam search your deck for ways to get eradicator virus, cycle the virus with Malice and have a target for it with Darkest Diabolos. The Virus is particularly good Vs. Floo because they only run a certain amount of threats, so as you see in the games we show in the video once we take care of their tributes they can't recycle them anymore due to Lair of darkness being able to fill their board with tokens they cannot get rid of.  &nbsp;  The deck is very fun and hilarious to play.

But if you think that 7 Reloads is a bit too much you can throw the Marrillas out for 2 Dogmatika Punishment and have more removal.

Only one of each Level 8 Kaiju. I wanted to keep Kaiju count as small as possible to avoid drawing too many Kaijus. Having one more Kaiju doubles your chance of drawing too many Kaijus (two or more) from 5% to 10%. Luna and Alpha can bounce Kaijus back to your hand for another use. Slumber is a decent board clear - but also its GY effect can come in useful; especially if your opponent mills it for you (eg: Zombie Vampire).  Ecclesia tags out into a Level 8, Iris Swordsoul. You'll want to target Luna or Ecclesia with Sauge de Fleur and chain their effects to Sauge's targeting to gain extra value. Iris Swordsoul isn't ideal to draw but its summoning condition might not be too hard to meet (using your imperms or your opponent's negates). If you're lucky it could even be disruption on your opponent's turn.  Handtraps also serve as a backup normal summon to synchro Psychic End Punisher. Ogre is backup E-Tele target as well."

Probably not but let's try anyway.","A budget version of my main deck from Master Duel intended for real play, the deck is focused entirely on going second and winning off of 2 level 8's into Dragluon into Numeron Dragon.  Going first, the best option is usually to set up Spirit Dragon and sit on it unless you absolutely need to go into Azure-Eyes, although Hope Harbinger is also very good.  The deck actually does pretty well in the long game as long as the opponent can't remove True Light, as a free reanimation every turn represents serious inevitability.  The deck's biggest weakness is bricking hard from all of the random dragon garnets.  Since I had to drop a huge amount of the handtraps I would normally be playing over budget concerns, more hands should be able to combo, but the caveat is that breaking the opponent's board is so much harder.  At least kaiju are good at that, not to mention how well they interact with a Relinquished Anima summoned off a White Stone.  My rule for deckbuilding was no card with a TCGPlayer average price over $10, although I did allow one exception in the form of a singular Bingo Machine Go that can be searched off True Light and find either of the Blue-Eyes starters.  If I had more budget, I'd have 1 Abyss Dragon to find Chaos Form, 1 Heart-Earth for going first, 1 Soldier of Chaos as a banisher, maybe 1 ZEUS for control, 1 Star Eater to synchro with Ash, and some combination of additional Imperm, Droplet, Lightning Storm, Ash, or even Droll and Lock.  I'd also note that the sidedeck is half being used here as a maybeboard so don't give it too much thought."

Streamlined and built more around the upcoming POTE meta.,"Konami has confirmed that the new Mayakashi support will come out in November in the ""Magnificent Mavens"" Holiday Box. Knowing this, and thinking that the meta won't shift far from Tearlaments and Spright by November, I wanted to make a ready-to-play Mayakashi deck for when the deck finally becomes playable in the TCG. Granted, Mayakashi isn't going to be tier 1 or the like, but I feel this specific build is strong enough to take on the upcoming meta.  One thing about Mayakashi itself is that it isn't strong enough to function on its own. It has a strong going-first combo that can easily result in a pop, two negates, or more, but it cannot play through negates and it cannot go second. To remedy this, I've included the Eldlich engine, which I feel can fill both of the niches. I've also included a small Zombie World package because of how well it works with Mayakashi and Eldlich.  &nbsp;  A few notes:  <span>3x Yuki-Onna, The Icicle</span> Mayakashi - This card does everything for the Mayakashi archetype. Not only does it allow you to link climb into Yuki-Onna, The Absolute Zero Mayakashi, it also allows you to special any of your synchros during your opponent's turn. Because of this, I decided to play 3 along with 2 of the link-2, because you can link up and down, which allows you to dump 2-3 of this card into your GY in a single combo chain.  <span>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</span> - I like this card not only because it works against Tearlaments, but also because it can insulate your combos from D.D. Crow as well as keep Dakki in the GY. Granted, D.D. Crow is much better in the Tearlaments match-up, so I've also thrown in two in the side deck.  <span>No Crossout Designator</span> - I experimented with this card for a while because stopping Nibiru, The Primal Beaingis so crucial in this deck, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it's not really a worhwhile addition. 9/10 times my opponent would have a Nibiru + another hand trap (which is really hard for Mayakashi to play through) or I would just not draw Crossout. I eventually figured that, even if I did get Nibiru'd, I could just fall back on the Eldlich cards or slap a Zombie World down and sit on a couple of hand-traps. I decided to substitute Crossout with Triple Tactics Talent since it could snipe hand-traps or just act as a Pot of Greed. I prefer to play only two, though, as drawing more than 1 makes for a very bricked hand.  <span>1 Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi and Shiranui's Tale</span> - To me, this card is a gimmick/a win-more card. I will say, if you can pull this off then you will win the game (usually), but so much has to go right in order to resolve this card that it really isn't worth playing more than 1. Your Hajun, which is an negate magnet, has to resolve, Dakki can't be D.D. Crow'd or Ghost Belle'd, and the field cannot be Nibiru'd, AND you have to have either drawn this card (without letting it brick your hand) or have searched it with Mayakashi Return. The best part about this is that it's a searchable trap that can be used with Eldlich the Golden Lord, and that it can recover a banished Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi. The full Mayakashi combo is strong enough without this, anyways.  <span>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</span> - This card is the most consistent to summon monster to out high attack monsters that are unaffected by card effects (e.g. Psychic End Punisher).  &nbsp;  I really love Mayakashi and want this deck to be the best it can be. Any and all comments/criticisms are welcome."

Have Mystic Piper and Kinka-byo be your only normal summons and try to thin out your deck via playing the Good Stuff&trade; and having Piper be a recurring Pot Of Greed. You obviously are not going to win with Piper. He is there to take up your normal summon slot and allow you to draw into answers. The primary win condition to this deck is via the Extra Deck or the Adventurer Token engine. I wouldn't suggest building this deck at all.

There are a lot more plays that can stem from this but this is the bare bones Plans for what this deck is gonna do. I will break why each cards are in the deck and what they do here.  <strong><span>The Monsters: </span></strong>We're running an Onomat(The Dododos, Dadadas, etc) engine in this deck due to them being able to spam themselves out onto the field for Rank 4 plays with Utopia double and Xyz that need 3 materials like Number 104. With their searching spell card they are good at what they need to do. ZS - Ascended Sage plays really well in this deck since it's a free special summon on an empty field and it searches our Rank-up-Magic limited Barian force when used to summon a utopia monster. Utopic Astral Hope is alright in this deck since it's also a special summon but it's only when you have an Xyz Monster(s) o the field. It also has a searching effect but the discard cost makes it situational. Astra Kuribo is just a free special summon as well as providing protection to our Xyz monsters when used as material, shame that protection goes away when we use our Rank-up-Magic on said monster; Pretty good overall. Ash-Blossum is just a good handtrap so :3  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells:</span></strong></span> Onomatopickup and Onomatoparia are our searching spells to add our Onomats to our hand. Prime Discard targets for Onomatopaira are Utopic Onomatopoeia(can be revived with Zybababancho Gagagacoat) and Dodododwarf and Gogogoglove(can revived itself). Ascension of the Seven Emperors is the new support that came out recently, it searches out our Rank-up-Magics and Barian Spell/Trap cards as well as setting up Barian Chaos Draw for our next draw phase; Really nice card to have in this deck. ZEXAL Construction is another spell searcher that can add, ZS - Ascended Sage, Zexal Contruction, and any NORMAL(can't search Rank-up-Magic Quick Chaos unfortunately) Rank up magic spell card; although instead of discarding for cost you need to send a card from your hand back to your deck, good targets for this are Double or Nothing, Rank-up-Magic the Seventh one and Barian's Chaos Draw.  For our Rank-up-Magics we are running two Limited Barian's Force and Urgent Chaos; these are just the generally best choice for this deck. Limited Barain force is pretty flexible with being able to turn any Rank 4 in our deck into a Number C106 for a field negate. Urgent Chaos lets us dodge targeted effect by ranking up our Xyz Monster, Rank-up on our opponent's turn, rank-up during the battle phase to get an extra attack in, and it's our rank-up-magic that can rank-up Number 107 into Number C107 since Limited Barain force can only work on Rank 4 monsters. Rank-up-magic the Seventh One and Barian Chaos Draw allow us to cheat any Number C10x out from the extra deck, we can do this semi consistently with Ascension of the Seven Emperors; you only really want one of each of these to not have Bricky Hands.  Memories of Hope is an interesting card, it can potentially allow for a lot of Draws when our board is created(With the bare bones plan for this deck involving at least 3 Number Xyz Monsters hitting the Field, we can get even more Number Monsters depending on our starting hand) but you'll only get the maximin benefit after achiving our end board so you'll end up not using the card until the end of your turn. Potentially it can end up being a useless card if you cannot bring out any Xyz Monsters but the reward of being able to draw more cards is also pretty good. It's good enough at 2.  Double or Nothing is needed for Utopia Double effect, you can also go for an OTK if you want with Utopia since it is in the deck. Called by The Grave helps with dealing with handtraps. Zexal Feild allows us to attach one of our Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck to our Xyz monster, use this to attach a monster to THE KAISER to allow it to summon 3 Number monsters from the Extra Deck.  <span><strong><span>The Trap:</span></strong></span> Eternity of the Seven Emperors is our only trap in this deck, it allows us to add a negate to our board which isn't half bad. It's a shame that we can only search it with Ascension of the Seven Emperors.  <strong><span>Extra Deck:</span></strong> Our extra deck consist of only Number Xyz Monsters and Number C monsters.  <span><strong><span>Utopia:</span> </strong></span>Used to activate ZS Utopic Zage's Search if you can't summon Utopia double. Use Rank-up-Magic Limited Barain's Force to turn it into Number C106 for a field negate. You can also go for an OTK by going into this card with Utopia double.  <span><strong><span>Utopia Double:</span></strong></span> used to go into THE KAISER or Utopia  <strong><span>THE KAISER:</span> </strong>Use this to cheat out our Number Monsters. Know that you can't special summon after using this effect as well as damage you deal being halfed for the rest of this turn.  <span><strong>Number 101/C101:</strong></span> Pretty good removal and the Chaos Number has a decent Floating effect.  <span><strong><span>Number 104/C104:</span></strong></span> You want Number C104 since it's one of this decks few disruptions on your opponents turn. Really good card if you can bring it out.  <span><strong><span>Number 105/C105:</span> </strong></span>Number 105 is a pretty fun card overall if you crash into a big card. Number C105 has some targeted Destruction with some burn damage effect. Both just ok cards.  <strong><span>Number 106/C106:</span></strong> Easy to make cards that can be a plan B for this deck if you can't bring out THE KAISER  <span><strong>Number 107/C107:</strong> </span>Number 107's effect only will be meant to deal with Battle Traps/effects so it end up being situational. Number C107 is a feild Negate as well as being the one of the Biggest Beaters in the Deck. You cheat these card out with THE KAISER and The Seventh One.  <span><strong><span>Barian Hope:</span></strong></span> Can be a pretty big beater but it's copying effect usually requires a bit of set up to work. Really wish we got a re-train for this card that can use the effects of Card's attached to itself. Neat Card tho.  <span><strong><span>Side Deck:</span> </strong></span>The 4 Xyz monsters were considered for this deck but they have problems; You cannot bring out Number 102 normally so you need to bring it out with Kaiser and if you rank it up into Number C102 then you can only use it's effect once. Number 102 /C102 are very situational since most deck don't modify their attacks and this deck doesn't have a way to change the opponents monster's attack. Then was have spell/trap removal with Feather Duster and Twin Twisters.  I hope you the person reading this can have some fun with this deck. It's not that great but that's alright. Just go have some fun with some freinds. Good Night fellow duelists."

OUR draw phase.,"50 cards, but you rarely draw a hand that doesn't have a starter. Not the most powerful deck, but usually pretty good!  Invoked plays on your turn, Generaider plays on theirs. Generally your best turn 1 board will be some combination of Mechaba, VFD, Boss Stage, and DPE. Mechaba and Harr are generally enough to stop most hands. Against Floowandereeze, summon Caliga to shut off their gimmick. You aren't making Accesscode often if at all, so feel free to replace that line with whatever you want.  Target Mechaba or any level 9 Generaider with Monstrosity for an instant VFD. Only use it to summon from hand as a last resort.  Droll synergizes really well with this deck since you can make them draw cards, then make them discard one with Harr and chain Droll to stop them from searching again that turn."

""Son bienvenidos mis amigos""  -Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc"" data-name=""https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc"">https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc</a> )  &nbsp;  A little early for any significant religious holidays; but not too early for any significant deck that came out from the mother herself. Now is it really the most significant and obscene defensive deck in the current day? The answer to that is sadly no (that would be Eldlich and all his forms). However with Konami almost ready to unban her cards from the banlist (after so many years), we can easily argue that it's a lot better as a potential anti-meta deck (and more fluent than possibly Nekroz). Not to mention with the most recent support that came out in the OCG is soon to move it away from it's floodgate like strategy, which is kinda nice honestly.  &nbsp;  Now at most, True Draco is pretty easy to understand and play for those who want to learn archetype based strategies (almost as easy as interpreting some parts of the Catholic Bible). For starters, this archetypes continuous Spell/Traps run on tributes; their effects trigger with tributes; and they can be tributed for tribute summoned (for monsters such as <a data-name=""Majesty Maiden, the True Dracocaster"">Majesty Maiden, the True Dracocaster</a>; but can also be tributed using any other faceup continuous Spell/Trap on the field). Their recovery spell, <a data-name=""Disciples of the True Dracophoenix"">Disciples of the True Dracophoenix </a>is by far their most useful card for play extensions (in my opinion). Not because it recovers important cards such as <a data-name=""True King's Return"">True King's Return</a>; but it cleans out the Graveyard to make use of a very important hand trap I tend to try to make use of, <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>. Other floodgates such as <a data-name=""The Monarchs Erupt"">The Monarchs Erupt</a>, <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> had made significant impacts to halt any sudden movements against more fast paced decks (like Braded-Despia, P.U.N.K, and Floowandereeze).  &nbsp;  That being said, the most massive issue that True Draco does have is the fact that (besides that generic floodgates do backfire on itself) it's worst matchups are against other stronger, more fluent floodgate decks that don't mind cards that dodge the effect of <a data-name=""The Monarchs Erupt"">The Monarchs Erupt</a> (mainly Eldlich). I'm for certain that this is because True Draco doesn't have a strong enough archetype based card pool that Eldlich has; but that isn't the case. Rather it could be the reality that the archetype in general isn't as fast pace as it was back in it's prime, compared to what came afterwards."
