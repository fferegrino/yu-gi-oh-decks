Have your recent Gacha pulls been very lackluster? Do you believe Altergeist to be too strong of a tier 0 deck that would be unfair to play against so you wish to play a fairer control oriented deck? Whatever your reason to turn to S-Force I judge you by your life choices that led you here.  But now that you have decided to fight the good fight in the name of justice and chase after I:P Masquerena all day and night (oh I see, so that's why you're here) we might as well have a look at a deck list.  &nbsp;  <span>You know a deck list is going to be good if whoever made the deck feels they need to explain and justify their choices beforehand. But alas, here we are:</span>  If you rather play Pot of Extravagance (because you inherited 500.000$ to afford those pots and all the extra ED monster it requires) you can easily cut out the Ghost Reaper targets.  Since I'm instead playing Pot of Desires I chose to run 2 S-Force Showdown. Same with Orrafist, since he's not too bad. Well he's not good either but Ghost Ogre'ing a monster once is better than not ogre'ing at all.  &nbsp;  <span>""I'm sorry, I've spend the past week starring at Rappa Chiyomaru and have honestly no idea what this deck does"":</span>  Well hello there, man of culture. If you haven't taken the time to go through this deck's line of plays by yourself - for completely understandable reasons - let me do you a favor and go through their 2 main combos.  <strong>Rappa Chiyomaru + Gravitino:</strong> ""I Normal Summon Aleister!"" Sorry, force of habit. I meant Normal Summon S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru. You then banish Gravitino in hand for cost returning her to your hand to Special Summon S-Force Oka-San (apparently some people call her Pla-Tina). She will then Special Summon your banished Gravitino who in turn adds a S-Force Spell/Trap to hand. Add S-Force Showdown and Special Summon Chiyomaru from hand.  <strong>Rappa Chiyomaru + Pla-Tina + any S-Force Monster:</strong> This combo too starts with Normal Summoning Chiyomaru. (I think I'm starting to get over my nightmares) This time you banish the remaining S-Force from hand for Chiyomaru's effect. This S-Force cannot be Pla-Tina since she cannot Special Summon herself with her effect. If you had Gravitino you could just do the above combo meaning realistically the S-Force you'd banish in this case are either a second copy of Chiyomaru or Orrafist. Now Chiyomaru will Special Summon Gravitino from deck who will again search you Showdown. Showdown will Special Summon your Pla-Tina in hand (yes, she only shows up at the very end of the combo, I'M SORRY!) who will Special Summon the S-Force monster you banished at the very beginning for Chiyomaru's effect.  <strong>Tl;dr or the ""still can't get my eyes off of Chiyomaru explanation"": </strong>First combo ends in Chiyomaru, Pla-Tina and Gravitino. Second combo end in your banished S-Force, Pla-Tina and Gravitino.  &nbsp;  <span>""So that's it?"":</span>  I hear ya (and Konami I hope you can hear them, too) and well, yup. That's it. A 2 to 2.5 card combo that results in 3 monsters on the board with no interruption. But what it does do is giving Mekk-Knights a run for their mechanics (and losing the race by miles). They affect your opponents monsters in the same column as your S-Force monsters. Most notably is Gravitino who makes it so that if your opponent's monster in the same column leaves the field it gets banished instead. So try placing your three monsters in the middle three zones to cover both EMZ to force their Link Monsters to get banished after link climbing.  But the spice lies with the rest of your hand. There can be only one is one insane card. (What, you expect me to elaborate?) If you draw Specimen you can actually link 2 of your S-Forces away for I:P and then Special Summon Gravitino back in the same column as an opponents monster. I'd advise you to use Pla-Tina and Gravitino as link material since Chiyomaru's effect is a Quick Effect to summon another S-Force in a zone your opponent controls a monster to force a banish with Gravitino's effect if you happen to have another S-Force in hand to pay for her cost. (no I'm not keeping track of how many cards I'm hypothetically holding) Your Chiyomaru could then Special Summon Orrafist for an actual interruption. If all else fails, you have a good array of handtraps at your disposal with Dimension Shifter, Ash Blossom and Ghost Belle.  &nbsp;  <span>""Where's Isolde?"":</span>  Another good point, well done. As nice as it feels to resolve Isolde, set up the aforementioned board with a bonus Apollousa I doubt you've played any actual Yu-Gi-Oh since your kindergarden days. The chances of your Isolde engine getting ashed at your Normal Summon is a high as it gets leaving y\ at the mercy of a bloodthirsty zombie lord and it's genetically modified human-animal hybrid pets and his intergalactic weapon of mass destruction. I wouldn't wanna be your Torn Scales. So where's the difference if they ash your Chyiomaru you may ask and you may not! Chyiomaru's a quick effect, your Gravitino is already banished so amy S-Force card will do to set up the same board during your opponents turn. So if you can't win anyways, might as we steal their turn. I swear we're on the side of justice!  &nbsp;  Well, that should be about it.  Now go fight crime and get your game on!"

However having fun and win games is not as big of a trouble as the first sentence made it sound. You summon big beatsticks, clear boards and throw hand traps as if you friend fell over and you just prepared a whole batch of snowballs meant for their face.  We split this deck in two paths you always want to do.  The Armed dragon path leading to a Level 10 Thunder / Lv10 thunder + White or vanilla for board clear,  And the Windwitch path which will  make you a protected crystallwing.  Thanks to the Windwitch combo not needing the normal summon, you just need to draw your bell or search it with wynn and start the combo.

So the primary strategy is to set up your twin loop while locking them out of the game with backrow and Gryphon, and using Abomination to pop cards on the field with Lil-la. This also allows you to use floodgates like order as one turn stuns because Abomination can pop them when you don't need them anymore. Excced lets you extend into I:P and set up Gryphon lockout, Unicorn spin, or Underworld Goddess. While Alpha is a card you can summon with either twin links on the field can act as spot removal and extend by being link material. It's not needed but its an interesting tech. If you don't want to play Gryphon and are looking for something more aggressive you can swap it out for an Accesscode. Don't know what the meta will look like post LIOV so hand trap ratios can vary, and always looking for ways to improve the deck so suggestions are welcome!"

The synergy between these archetypes is very good which ma,"<span><strong>This deck is as casual as they come. It's by no means competitive or meta, but it is interesting...</strong></span>  <span>This deck has 2 goals. Summoning high level xyz with the trains, the Flying Pegasus and the Anchor Drill and getting your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant out. Ancient Gears on their own are not that good in my opinion so a little support from an archetype that can frequently summon is nice.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>You don't really want to draw this card. You can't special summon it and tribute summoning this thing gets countered very easily which ends up with you losing 2 or three cards (if geartown is on the field only 2). It's why I put them at 1. I don't think you will even use more than 1 Golems in a duel. The longer the duel lasts the harder it becomes to win.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon: </strong>I can hear you thinking to yourself; ""Why Gadjiltron Dragon? Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is much better!!"" True the card is better, but for what we are trying to do here Gadjiltron Dragon suits this deck better with it 8 star scaling. With this card you can get very easily into Seven Sins and banish your oponnent's monsters often locking them out of their effects in the process. This card is searchable with Urgent Schedule, Ancient Gear Wyvern and can be returned from the graveyard using Bullet Express Train. So only 2 as well.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Wyvern: </strong>This card is basically the Elemental Hero Stratos of this deck. It searches out any Ancient Gear cards in your deck. You can extend the combo searching for Ancient Gear Box first and then using the effect of Box you can add an Ancient Gear Frame or Infinitrack Anchordrill to your hand. You go plus 2 for no cost so run three at all times. </span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Box:</strong> This the garnet in the deck so you really don't want to draw it. I run the card at one because it is recyclable so you can just use it from the graveyard again. Running at 2 could be possible too but I would not recommend it at three. The risk of drawing increases substantially.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Frame:</strong> When summoned you can discard one card in return for an Ancient Gear Fusion or Ancient Gear Golem. Handy card in a pinch but often you'll use Wyvern instead. We use 1</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: </strong>A walking polymerization. When summoned it does 600 damage to your opponent but We use it for its ability to fusion summon any Ancient Gear monster. Often we fuse into Ancient Gear Howitzer to get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field. Definitely use 3.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Howitzer:</strong> In my opinion a very underrated card. Unaffected by card effects and it can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent... Every turn. Your opponent probably wants this card destroyed. But if for some reason he doesn’t and you don’t really care for the burn effect you can always destroy it yourself to get Ancient Gear Golem out to fusion summon a Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. If you have Ancient Gear Golem out in the field and you use Ancient Gear Fusion you can use material from the deck to complete the summon instead. So Howitzer is a powerful card that opens the path to an even better card. We run 1 or 2.</span>  <span><strong>Super Express Bullet Train</strong>: A rank 10 train card that is very easy to bring out. All you need, is to have only earth machine monsters on the field. Usually the plan is to bring out this card together with Heavy Freight Train Derricane and possible Flying Pegasus and Anchordrill to xyz summon your bossmonsters. Downside is that it can’t attack without sending 2 cards you control to the graveyard. This however poses no problem for us because we only use it as xyz fodder. A nice extra is that it lets you take back a card from the graveyard to your hand if Bullet train is in the graveyard. I run 2. I wouldn’t use three to prevent bricking.</span>  <span><strong>Infinitrack Anchordrill:</strong> Has enormous synergy with the Ancient Gear archetype. It is usable for Ancient Gear Box because it has 500ATK and it can summon another card from the hand. Besides that it can combine the stars for both cards making lets say Gadjiltron Dragon and Anchordrill fodder for the rank 12 xyz Seven Sins.</span>  <span><strong>Heavy Freight Train Derricane: </strong>Just like Bullet Express Train it is so easy to bring out. Use this card for xyz fodder too. Ideally we run 2.</span>  <span><strong>Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede: </strong>Lets you summon a card from your graveyard in defense position but without its effect. Nice effect but we will use its secondary one more often. It lets us copy the level of another face up card to either Flying pegasus or the other way around. Best used with the trains or level 8 monsters. I use 3.</span>  <strong>Exodius: The Ultimate Forbidden Lord: </strong>We use this card as xyz fodder too and it lets you recycle the cards in your graveyard. One is enough.  <strong>Machina Citadel: Same with Exodius:</strong> we use it as xyz fodder and sometimes you can use its effect to destroy your opponent's monsters. One is enough.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Spells (we don’t really use traps in this deck.)</strong></span>  <span><strong>Foolish Burial goods: </strong>Use this to send Ancient Gear Catapult to pop Geartown. One is enough.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Catapult: </strong>We use Catapult to pop Geartown and summon Ancient Gear golem and Wyvern to get into Chaos Giant. Only way to really summon Golem aside from tributing and using Howitzer. Run three at all times, it is the foundation of the Ancient Gears.</span>  <span><strong>Geartown:</strong> Used in tandem with Catapult this can give you a Chaos Giant and more. Like Catapult, run three at all times.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Fusion: </strong>If used with Ancient Gear Golem you can search the deck for materials too. Chaos Giant can be out in one turn this way. I would run three.</span>  <span><strong>Terraforming:</strong> Speaks for itself really.</span>  <span><strong>Urgent Schedule:</strong> This card lets you summon 2 monsters from the deck. One lvl 4 or lower and one level 5 high or higher. This used to be quite an expensive card but is more affordable nowadays. Getting 2 free summons when your opponent controls more cards is very helpful for your xyz and fusion plays. I recommend running 3.</span>  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Fortress:</strong> I have mixed feelings about this card. On one hand it protects your Ancient Gears but on the other hand it is an extremely xenophobic card. When popped it allows you to summon an Ancient Gear monster from your hand or grave but for the rest of the turn you can summon ONLY Ancient Gears. So be careful with this one. I run 3 but you could run 1, 2, 3 or even none I don't really know with this one.</span>  <span><strong>Pot of Avarice: </strong>Very nice card to recycle your cards in the graveyard again and it gives you 2 extra cards in the hand as well. We use 1 or 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The extra deck</strong></span>  <strong>Double Headed Anger Knuckle:</strong> This card is good for getting those level 10 cards on the field. We use only one.  <span><strong>Ancient Gear Ballista:</strong> This card is a godsend for Ancient Gear players. It synergizes immensely with the trains and earth machine monsters in general. It only requires 2 earth machine monsters to summon it. Ballista can add one Geartown to your hand or any Ancient Gear Monster in the main deck. Usually what you want to do with this card is to add a Geartown to your hand, you play it and then activate Ballista’s secundary effect to reduce an opponent’s monster ATK/DEF to zero and send the Geartown to the graveyard as cost which in turn activates Geartown’s effect. </span>  <span><strong>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant:</strong> The one card I’ve been talking about so much. With his 4500 atk and powerful effect it’s a force to be reckoned with. Unaffected by spell and trap cards and the option to attack every monster your opponent controls once. If that wasn’t good enough already it does piercing damage too. Run 1 or 2, it depends really.</span>  <span><strong>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>Sporting an attack of 4400 this card this card is quite the powerhouse too. Its effect isn’t as good as Chaos Giant but it can get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field when destroyed, giving you the chance to get another Chaos Giant. We run 1 or 2.</span>  <span><strong>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem:</strong> Essentially a weaker version of Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. When fusion summoned with more than one Ancient Gear Golem it can attack multiple times in your battle phase. When destroyed by card effect you can get your Ultimate Golem out and that way you could get an Chaos Ancient Gear Giant too.</span>  <span><strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: </strong>A rank 11 xyz easily summoned using Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora. Can attack up to the number of attached materials plus one. You can boost the attack of this card by 2000 by detaching one card which makes Liebe a powerful beatstick. 1 is more than enough.</span>  <span><strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora:</strong> Can detach one card to make another unaffected by card effects. When used on Chaos Giant it makes the card nearly invincible.</span>  <span><strong>Number 77 Seven Sins:</strong> Out of all the rank 12 cards this one is the easiest to summon. There are 3 ways to summon it and they all have their merits.. We can summon it the normal way by using 2 rank 12 monsters, this has the advantage that we can use its effect immediately and banish your opponent monsters. The only downside here is that seven sins has only 1 card to protect itself when targeted for battle or by card effects unless you don’t activate the effect. The second way involves xyz summuning Rank 8 Dingirsu Orcust of The Evening Star to your field. You then overlay Pain Gainer on it and then into Seven Sins. Last way to summon it is to xyz summon Ravenous Tarantula into Sevens Sins or first into Pain Gainer and then Seven Sins. We run only one, the resources needed for this card are substantial enough that you probably won’t get another one on the field.</span>  <span><strong>Number 84 Pain Gainer</strong>: Also 2 ways of summoning it but doing it the normal way  is not really possible in this deck. We mostly use Dingirsu or Ravenous Tarantula to summon it instead. Usually this card is just a stepping stone for Seven Sins or if you can summon Seven Sins the normal way and still have room for Pain Gainer it can be a good card on its own. We Also run one.</span>  <span><strong>Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula:</strong> If used a bit further down the duel this card will turn all your monsters into beatsticks on steroids. It adds the difference in life points as attack and defense to face up cards you control. This in combination with a Chaos Giant will completely destroy any monster. We mostly use the rank 10 trains or a Flying Pegasus to Xyz into it. If you decide to not go further the xyz chain and keep it as it is you can punish special summoning with it too. Every time your opponent special summons a monster they lose 600 lifepoints. And if that wasn’t enough you can detach one monster to destroy all monsters your opponent controls that have attack less or equal to this card. You could run 2 but I run one.</span>  <span><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy:</strong> A very good  generic staple usable in a lot of decks. It has decent negate and forces cards to attack this one instead of another card your opponent wants to attack. When an xyz card is destroyed you can add half the attack of the destroyed card to another xyz you control. 1 is enough.</span>  <span><strong>Dingirsu The Orcust of The Evening Star:</strong> Really a good staple as well. I am actually inclined to use Dingirsu more then Harbinger in duels. You can use this card for Pain Gainer too. Aside from that it can protect cards from destruction by detaching materials. Run 1.</span>  <span><strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid: </strong>Can be used as material for Dora when you destroy a monster by battle. It has build in protection as well. I would run 1, it’s a good card but I don’t use it all that often.</span>  <strong>There is no side deck in this profile. I leave this to your imagination.

Another difference is I field Lady Debug for extra search over Balancer Lord.  <em>Spells:</em>  Usual set of A.I./Ignister spells, I run 2 A.I.Land and a Terraforming over 3 A.I.Land to reduce opening hand flooding.  <em>Traps: </em>a Mirror Force for extra removal, and an Impermanence for some extra negation (have another in the side deck if i feel like i need 2)  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  Link: The Arrival and Darkfluid are the main boss monsters, with Accesscode as a backup. Dark Templar is used to Soul Charge out more Materials for links/synchros/xyz, while Fire Phoenix is a nice board presence card especially w/ TAI Strike. Wicckid and Splash Mage provide some cheaper link plays, providing either protection for other monsters or getting more stuff out of the GY.  Synchro: Wind Pegasus is nice for some Spell/Trap nuking along with it's other effect, while Cyberse Quantum Dragon, like Wicckid provides protection for other monsters and also is a decent monster in general.  XYZ: 2 Light Dragons. Light Dragon is nice.  Sideboard: I have some stuff in my sideboard for getting more control cards to stay alive if it's an issue since my deck isn't as laser-focused on OTK as other @Ignister decks. (Lightning Storm, Harpie's FD, SoRL, another copy of Impermanence, Dark Ruler, etc.)  &nbsp;"

Long story short short: Junk Converter + Opponet with no hand traps = 90% win.  This deck revolves around summoning Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity during your opponets turn which makes them <strong>unable to use any effects.</strong>  In order to do that you will need to follow this simple one card combo:  In order for this to work you will need to have junk converter in hand. He can be searched with reinforcement of the army or you can draw into him with the multiple draw cards which you have.  The combo is:  1.Junk converter effect search for junk synchron.  2.Normal summon junk synchron and special summon converter.  3.Synchro into Junk speeder.  4.Use converter effect to ss junk synchron from gy.  5.Use speeder effect to special summon from deck ""Satellite Synchron"", ""Cyberse Synchron"" and ""Steam synchron"".  6. Synchro summon using Junk Synchron and Junk Speeder into Chaos Ruler.(You dont have to use the effect but it is good way to add cards like caligo and dopper.)  7.During opponets turn use steam effect to synchro summon using ""Chaos Ruler"", ""Steam Synchron"" and ""Cyberse Synchron"" into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  8.His effect will trigger and so your opponet will not be able to do anything :)  <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>  This deck is not only limited to this combo even though it is its main purpose. You can try to go into as many synchro's as possible depending on your hand. You can also use any card that is on the field excpet steam synchron, cyberse synchron and chaos ruler since those are needed for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  P.S.  This is the first deck that I have submitted so if you have any suggestions please tell me :)"

Charles is the thematic choice, but there's a new generic level 9 synchro running around these days who's pretty good. Called, uh... Shenshen? Who completes the Macro lock combined with Herald so any card going to the graveyard from hand, deck, or field is banished instead.  Interrupted, I find I can still usually end on at least Herald plus Savage in most circumstances, which is not insignificant, especially with Drytron.  I'm open to criticisms and suggestions, of course, you all know where the comments are."

After you dump them in, you can go into Verte and use Verte to send the fusion spell, dodging it's hard once per turn and going into the larger fusions. Then you're able to swing in for a ton of damage and hopefully finish off there. The deck's incredibly consistent, can finish off the game in a single turn, and most importantly, it has furry girls with nice tits."

I believe this to be the most consistent form of the deck, being able to wack out Red Supernova on the first turn. This deck is pretty gamer in my honest and valued opinion. So, what's the strategy? Generally, you want a level 2 tuner and a level 4 non-tuner on the field to Synchro into Red rising dragon, and develop from there. The level 2 tuners in this deck are RED resonator, and CRIMSON resonator.  Red is decent, and it can aid in the recovery of life points if special summoned back from the grave via Red Rising Dragon, however, I prefer Crimson. Because, this way, If you have just summoned Red Rising Dragon and that crimson Resonator is the only other monster on the field, you can activate its effect to summon EITHER -- 2 more Red Resonators (LP bonus this way) or 1 Synkron Resonator and a Creation resonator (returns a resonator in the GY to your hand). If this succeeds, you have the perfect setup to go into Red Supernova Dragon - an incredibly powerful card, or (if the situation calls for it) King Calamity, by going into a RDA and then using your remaining two resonators to synchro in the the magnificent level 12 card.  I included 2 copies of Twin Twister just in case something like Zombie World is activated, preventing the summon of Red Rising Dragon. 3 copies of Resonator Command is a must -- it shouldn't be any lower than 3. Red Screen, as described in another, similar deck list (credit is where credit should be due) is simply put, a better version of Swords of Revealing Light. I included some draw power cards, because on the off chance you brick, it is imperative that you draw cards immediately, without waiting for the next Draw Phase.  That should be all, I tried keeping it as close to 40 cards without affecting the strategy. Thanks to the Rulers of Hell decklist for being the basis of my edited version. All criticisms welcome."

The Meta is dominated by combo decks that end in floodgates, control decks that set for five only to xyz summon for six and every other deck is just Shaddoll. Players resort to religious punishment to obstruct their opponents and Invoked is still exactly where it has always been. Has anyone seen Dragon Link?  At least one thing is for certain and that is that Salamangreat will find some way to adapt to whatever is currently meta and slightly change their deck to fit it's needs. If Fire monsters are good at one thing it's fighting fire with fire. If VW's emission scandal wasn't enough they've done did it again and brought floodgates back into the meta so the people at Salamangreat HQ (which is just a redecorated Sanctuary) quickly responded with, well, fighting fire with fire: Floodgates.  The current Meta decks are incredibly divers in their types. Hence, Rivalry of the Warlords. VW has wyrm and psychic, Drytron has machines and fairies and Eldlich Zoo has zombies and beast-warriors and the occasional spellcaster casting Divine Smite with a Nat20 for way to many d8s. I also heard there's a new villain trying to take over the tri-state area. Well slap a fedora on your Rivalry and call it Agent R: Good news, you just won. Locking these decks into a mono type really messes with their board and if you're hit by a Nibiru because you're opponent is stuck in July 2020 you'll at least force him into rocks, rendering all of his monsters useless unless they are playing Adamancipator. You should be fine.  If you're opponent has what is formally known as DINO DNA - <span><span>You see,</span> a few</span> <span><span>years back</span> on</span> <span>a routine dig..<span> - or plays any other deck that has more attributes than it has types, Gozen Match is a fantastic floodgate. You can't access your Code Talkers under it but Salamangreat Rage's first effect can pop if whenever you feel the flood has done it's job and you can safely leave the comfort of the arc. Just don't get stranded on a mountain; I know someone who had that happen to him.</span></span>  Parallel Exceed, or friendly neighborhood...something..is back but he's not here to leave, he's here to stay! (think I kinda messed up the saying) He's not an extender for your turn 1 Borrelsword because you're not used to winning the dice roll, instead he enables a small r4nk toolbox with Abyss Dweller and Bagooska.  Since you're not playing too many extenders (notice the complete absence of Will of the Salamangreat) you have enough space to comfortably run Called by the Grave and Upstart Goblin for a nice 39+1 card deck. Droll's dead this format, right?  WeLl AcKcHuAlLy, I pReFeR lAdY dEbUg. If this is you then congratulations, you just graduated clown school. (It's an actual thing and it honestly sounds cool. I'm sure it <span>mad</span>e you a very confident person which explains your bravery to make such foolish statements.) Bufferlo can be chain blocked, it gives you draw power, dumps your Salamangreats, is a fire monster (which is very important for Gozen Match) and it's also not a bug but instead belongs to a near endangered species that could use some more representation. (No, I'm not talking about Chemicritter players)  As always, Forbidden Droplet can be swapped for Dark Ruler No More and Accesscode Talker can trade places with Topologic Zeroboros.  Almiraj is probably the most flexible extra deck slot but I've seen more hands with Parallel eXceed and a handtrap as my only NS than I have a seen the video of Trif Gaming getting banned from Konami.

","So, here's what I refer to as a ""Dark pile"", AKA just a pile of fucking generic  Dark attribute support. The core of this deck is PK with a Danger! engine, to get fodder on the field easier for Bardiche, in order to set up a backrow of Pog Blade so you can pog the opponent's combo pieces. The Dangers! are fantastic for dumping PK's to grave and getting tons of bodies on field, and they also serve as a great source of draw power. There's also the duo of Dark Grepher and Armageddon Knight, which both help to fill up the grave to extend plays. As should be obvious by now, the graveyard is essential for this deck. I also included a small Levianeer package, so at the end of your plays, you can banish 3 unused Dark's to get out Levi and rip a card from the opponent's hand, making them start with 1 less card, as this is a going 1st control deck. In the extra, it's mainly a toolbox of various large monsters. There's Bardiche, which is your main large monster to summon as to set up a huge backrow. You also have the huge Xyz line-up, which is mainly there to be ranked up into VFD/Cali Yuga, but if you're unable to rank them up with Magic Force, you have the alternative option of poking in and going into Zeus instead. You also have the small Xyz Dragon package as to go into either Rebellion to finish off the game, or Requiem for negates, coupled with Pog Blade. This can make for an incredibly powerful deck if played right, but it sure as fuck isn't a meta contender for the time being, at least in my opinion. It's too fragile to cards like VFD and Vanity's to be able to go up against various meta decks. But, it's still incredibly fun and shows what PK is capable of doing in their long legacy. Update: Swapped around VFD and Cali for some better going first/second rank 8 options. Henry helped me with them; he's surprisingly chill on Discord."

The deck is oriented around aroma gardening and blessed winds.,"This and any deck that uses the aroma engine highly relies on backrow not being disrupted. If your opponent has a fast way of getting rid of your backrow (by being destroyed or banished) then you can replace them, since the main deck plays multiple backrow cards except for 2 slecific aroma traps, they aren't as important as blessed winds. Otherwise your gonna set up and with a protected stardust dragon you don't really have to worry about anything, except for evenly matched. That card hard counters this deck, so if you really want, you could swap some cards for a predaplant anaconda-dragoon combo. But if your opponent negates your backrow continuously, you'r in trouble. Most likely your going to lose if you faced against a fast paced combo deck. But on the other hand, this deck holds some combos too. Combo 1: you need a tuner and any other monster (that's why i play mind control) to easely make halqifibrax. Combo 2: you will need 2 plant monsters and A LP gain when you summon aromaseraphy jasmine. You'll search angelica or rose girl, but if you have both you can search something else. Then you need an extra monster for the 3rd effect of aromaseraphy jasmine. You'll special lonefire blossom and keep in mind that specialing all 3 copies of lonefire is not a good decision since you want to draw it. Combo 3: if you have a dna surgery you can surprise your opponent by normalling rose tentacles or using fragrance storm on your opponent's monster. Combo 4: when your opponent declares an attack on an aromage monster you control, if you have humid winds: activate humid winds to search marjoram then you can special summon her and banish a card(s) in your opponent's GY. Apart from all of that, it's all control based and oriented around your backrow. The best aroma backrow is aroma gardening, it can stall you long enough to get you back in the game, after that the 2nd best is blessed winds. Your whole deck is made around those cards. If your opponsnt desen't manage to disrupt you hard enough, you'r gonna generate resources like crazy. Another reason why i play dna surgery is for your extra deck monsters to gain extra effects from your aroma monsters, and another bonus is that it can potentially mess your opponent's effects, so i recommend you flipping it before the main phase. Only con about dna surgery is that it doesen't change types in the GY, so you can't recycle your extra deck monsters. Best cards to foolish burial are rose girl and flower bot, but sometimes aromages especially laurel and angelica."

I mean psychic wheeleder and psychic tracker as extender, the release of bardiche in legendary hero decks, Cherubini in DANE, the last support wave in PHRA and the release of tour guide of the banlist, the deck has now pretty good combo potential. </span>  <span>The playstyle of Pk is simple, firstly you try to get 2 level 3 monsters onto the board to summon cherubini, secondly you use cherubini to get graff or libic into the gy to get a cir out of the deck/hand or if you used tour guide allready to get one of them to the field and linked them of you can send any of your pk's to the gy and then you can go into bardiche and activate cir to get cherubini back onto the field. From here you have several options to come to the end board.</span>  <span>The 1st turn endboard (if you didn't brick or got nibirued) is 1 bard which is equiped with a wizard buster dest. sw.,1 I:P (apolousa/knightmare uni.), 1 verte anaconda,  1 union carrier, 1 dragoon and 2 fog blades. And on you're second turn you're going to OTK youre opponent with accesscode and arc rebelion, if this didn't work you can use AA-ZEUS and I:P as a back up plan.</span>  <span>The SPICE: 1 wizard buster dest. sw. is a great out against decks like drytron, it's basically a dweller for monster eff's. </span>  <span>The weak spots: This deck has obviously many weak spots, but I will only list the greatest. Artifact lancea, nibiru, forbidden droplets, dark ruler no more, Skull meister/ghost belle, d.barrier.</span>  <span>Future support: This deck is always happy if level/rank 3 or really generic XYZ support (like AA-ZEUS or F0 utopic future dragon) is on the horizon. The next card that we could get in the TCG that we know of is F0 utopic future dragon which is an upgrade to F0 utopic future. If we get this here in the TCG the endboard could shift from I:P for apolousa to F0 dragon. And here is why: 1.It has protection against destruction effs.and battle, 2. You can negate a monster eff and steal the opponents monster if he controls it and 3. If you have dante as XYZ material and detach him you can recycle Cherubini.  </span>  <span>And that's my Pk deck for the Feb. 2021 format. I'll update this deck as soon as new support is announced. </span>  <span>Ps. when do we get F0 utopic future dragon in the TCG komoney?!!!</span>"
