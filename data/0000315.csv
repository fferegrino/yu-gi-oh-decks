I would run 2 digs if I had them, because it's more generic, but it's also a UR, so...</p><p>General gameplan is to use scrap recycler, dark grepher, girsu, or armageddon knight to send a harp horror to GY and do Orcust stuff.</p><p>There is an extended scrap combo you can do if you open scrap recycler (or a way to it) and don't draw your garnets (golem, rosenix, world wand... yeah i know). It takes advantage of Golem and Recycler not being once per turn to use them multiple times in a turn. Combo is as follows:</p><ol><li>Recycler sends Rosenix to GY</li><li>Rosenix effect to summon token (sometimes a Danger! in hand can be used instead if you got ashed or something)</li><li>Link Scrap Wyvern</li><li>Wyvern effect to summon a scrap from GY and immediately pop it, to trigger 2nd effect:</li><li>Use Wyvern's 2nd effect to summon Scrap Golem from deck and then pop the wyvern (or a set spell you don't need, or an opponent's card if you're not on turn 1)</li><li>Golem effect to summon Recycler</li><li>Recycler sends World Wand to GY</li><li>This allows us to link summon Lib with golem and recycler</li><li>Lib effect to set World Legacy Succession (if it's not already in hand)</li><li>Succession to bring back Golem</li><li>Golem to bring back Recycler</li><li>Recycler sends Harp Horror (Note: If one of your recycler targets has ended up in the GY through other means, you can send a skeleton at this point instead)</li></ol><p>At this point you can either go into a 3 or 4 material Appolousa (depending on if Wyvern's still here), or another link-4, and use Lib's GY effect to shuffle an opponent's card away, then follow up with Orcust plays, but if we're going first I prefer to instead use Harp to summon Knightmare, link her + Golem into Galatea, Wand summons Harp, Galatea sets Babel, Knightmare sends Skeleton to GY, Overlay Galatea into Dingirsu and attach Knightmare, then link Dingirsu + Scrap Recycler into I:P Masquerena so you can go into a 2-3 material Appolousa (or other link-4) on your opponent's main phase, once they've played a card you want to shuffle away with Lib. We also have a skeleton in the GY that can bring back Dingirsu to send an opposing monster to GY (without targeting!) should it be necessary.</p><p>Alternatively, if you haven't done full combo, ending on Galatea + Masq with babel up lets you make a bomber dragon on opponent's turn and then use orcusts in GY to summon something into its zone and blow up the board. If you're really feeling spicy you can make a bomber dragon while Dingirsu is out and has material on it, using its destruction protection to only explode your opponent's field.</p><p>Another fun little technique is to use Knightmare during opponent's turn to send world wand and give Apollousa another 800atk, which gives her an extra negate. You can also use Knightmare as a combat trick during the damage step.</p><p>Oh yeah and the reason Wind Pegasus @Ignister is in the extra deck is for when you open scrap raptor with recycler already in hand, you can get scrap factory instead and then when wyvern pops you can summon an extra scrap raptor from deck (make sure wyvern is CL1 and factory CL2, then pop factory with wyvern cause you won't need it any more) and synchro wind pegasus with raptor + recycler later down the line (before you go into your link-4 or orcust plays). Feel free to swap it out for a knightmare cerberus or some other link monster you like if that feels like overkill (it is (but it's funny)).</p><p>Also, you can swap Borreload Dragon for Avramax if you'd prefer. I don't have him.</p><p>The Danger!?s exist as extenders if you get negated and sometimes, if you're lucky, they will unbrick a hand where you drew world wand or something. Mostly I just think they're cute, and a good way to get extra bodies on the field for link plays. You can also use Nessie as part of this package if you're feeling spicy. But honestly you could probably cut the Danger!s out for more handtraps and a 3rd raptor, if you want.</p><p>Speaking of handtraps, replacing the effect veilers with more copies of maxx c, ash, imperm, or adding crossout designator is probably worth doing if you can, but I don't own more copies of those cards because I'm a freak who keeps spending her crafting points on stupid sh*t instead of rounding out her collection of staples.</p><p>Finally, if you really want to have the Optimal Deck Size (truly enlightened players recognise that the optimal deck size is in fact 41-44. I will not be answering questions about this.) you can cut one of the orcustrated returns. I like running 2 because it can be a pseudo-opener or extender and/or unbrick bad hands.</p><p>Enjoy, and may your opponent's Ash remain firmly out of their opening draw.</p>"

Though far from meta-level, I have had it tested a dozen times to see its consistency, and it could play through some interruptions when going second and could easily get to Mirrorjade + another fusion going first. <br /><br />I am not one for detailed outline of how this deck works but the general flow (depending on the hand and interruptions you might get):</p><p>- Set up at least to Mirrorjade and preferably either masquerade or Despian Quaeritis (either through Aluber's effect and aim for branded fusion or through using Albaz's effect and fuse with an opponent's monster. If possible, kaiju the opponent first). When using branded fusion, use ad libitum as the other material, so you could make use of his recycle effects later on.</p><p>- Summon sequence: Lubellion -&gt; Albion -&gt; Mirrorjade, then set up for either Masquerade or Quaeritis with the remainder in your hand.</p><p>- If your monsters are disrupted, aim to recycle for Mirrorjade by searching for branded in red and target albaz or aluber again. Then chain this effect with the banished ad libitum (from using Albion's effect)&nbsp; you can search branded fusion again and chain it with ad libitum's effect to special summon Mirrorjade again.</p><p>- Other strats in a pinch: stall the opponent with Dimensional Barrier, the Artifact strategy, DRNM or worse yet; TCBOO (after you've made a safety net for yourself).</p><p>There are plenty of other players who've made a more detailed description of this archetype, but at least I would like to share my list for the cheapest set up I could think of (sadly, no ash...). Cards that you could add to increase the consistency further: 1x Branded fusion, 3x Branded opening (but not in this list due to the price at the moment) and 1x branded in red. Of course, ash too if you have them already or can afford them. So far, I could hold up fairly well in my locals.</p>"

This is mainly done with the 10 searchers this deck has access to, that being Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, Blue-Sky, Orcust Girsu, and World Legacy's Memory. <br /><br />Hard-to-out extra deck bosses are usually the win condition in this deck, like a I:P Masquereena boosted Avramax, an untargetable/undestroyable Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme or the column-dependent battle phase champion Mekk-Knight Morning Star.</p><p>In a simplified gamestate vacuum, Mekk-Knight Avramax is nigh-unkillable and often is a ""checkmate"" on your opponent.

Dimensional Fissure and Macro Cosmos work together to banish all cards from both players' graveyards, making it difficult for the opponent to use graveyard-dependent cards, effects, and strategies.</p><p>The deck's main win condition is to protect Dimensional Fissure and Macro Cosmos in order to continue banishing cards and disrupt the opponent's gameplay. To achieve this, the deck employs a range of support cards such as D.D. Survivor and D.D. Scout. These cards have effects that activate in the banished zone, which allows them to ""infinitely"" revive monsters and maintain a strong board presence.</p><p>In addition to these support cards, the deck also utilizes the powerful monarchs: Cauis, Raiza, and Mobius. These cards provide a range of effects that help to clear the opponent's board, set up bricks, and hit backrow, which can be a prevalent issue in Master Duel.</p><p>I personally have had great success with this deck, going 10-0 in matches against top tier decks such as Crusadia and Beetrooper. This deck not only offers a high level of competitiveness but also offers a budget-friendly option as it does not require the use of the Extra Deck in most cases.</p><p>Overall, Macro Monarchs is a well-rounded deck that offers a unique and effective strategy for disrupting the opponent's graveyard-dependent gameplay. I highly recommend giving this deck a try for players who are looking for a strong and budget-friendly option.</p>"

This deck also uses many trap cards to disrupt the opponent and make it difficult to create combos. Unlike most Cyber Dragon decks, this deck can go both first and second without many problems.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why I Haven't Added These Cards</h2><p>I have decided to use only one Cyber Dragon because when you use multiple Cyber Dragons the deck becomes very bricky. I have also decided not to add Machine Duplication because it is a card that often is a brick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>thank you for looking at the deck I have created and I hope you enjoy trying this deck out.</p>"

Auto win on basically any match up.","<p>The main goal of the deck is to see atleast clockwork night and one cyber dragon. However if you do see clockwork and rivalry and your opponent has no spell or traps to remove it, you basically auto win. Once these two cards are on the field together your opponent gets one summon then they are locked into machines, if they don't already have mosnters on the board. If they do already have mosnters than they immediately are locked out of playing anything except machine monsters which about 1% of decks can play through. If they do have any sort of removal for your floodgates you should already have an Omni negate set up if not two of them, seeing as you consistently see the combo pieces to either make infinity turn one or regulis turn one.</p><p>The reason why this deck is the most versatile and best for every match up, is because any cyber dragon + clockwork = contact fuse of your opponent's entire board. I have successfully contact fused a full 6 card tear board on turn two with literally two cards, putting my fortress dragon at 7500 atk and needing one more decent size monster to win the game. Also the combination of floodgates I have chosen has made it almost impossible for any deck to play except for mine.</p>"

Ghoti can perform quick synchros when ss and melffies can search out Pinny and Hop ear to achieve the same. Due to the nature of banish + next turn plays of the ghoti and the many numbers of melffy, the deck can play through and around quite a few handtraps/negates. Crossout is a extremly useful interupt and extender/starter that works the same as gold sarcophagus.</p><p>Melffy Wally, Puppy, Lifeless leafish are all 1 card starters.</p><p>The melffies can be used to search out pinny or hop ear and both their effects trigger in hand. depending on the opening hand you can usually have 1 banish from Askaan. And could go into 4-6-8-10 synchro climb while using melffies to pop/bounce and banish/board wipe with fish, providing a lot of interaction during your opponents turn. with muliple melffies you can also chain block to protect catty's effect, grating at least a lv 4 syncho with Pinny.</p><p>The 3 evil hero cards are used as back up when the opening hand isnt great, ss evil hero, normal summon any lv2 in hand xyz into Melffy of the Forest and search Puppy or Wally to start, these can then search more melffies in your opponents turn and gather enough resources to perfrom synchros. Melffy Fenny is a extra search target when you got catty/puppy + wally in hand</p><p>Other options:</p><p>dream shark is searchable through Arionpos' float effect and can be used to go into the lv7 white aura synchro which can then revive a fish tuner in the gy and go into any lv9 synchro, in this case shenshen for more interuption, but the combo isnt very consistent because dream sharks summon condition but a good option if you start with only fish. Baronne is a generic good option, but chengying and rudy rose feel better in this deck. Chengying has a natural synergy with the ghoti's heavy banish focus and Rudy rose is a good way to clean your opponents gy while setting your own ghotis and pumping Chengying and Deep Beyond's atk for a potential otk</p><p>The hand traps are all generic space and can be replaced with anything</p><p>The deck could work well with Sprights and could use a bystial or fenrir package but out of personal preference I did not add them in.&nbsp;</p><p>Feel free to experiment and provide feed back &lt;3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

They are kinda difficult to build in a pure way even with all the support they got. This List is made from many years of experience with this Archetype in a way to get the most out of many different Morphtronics with the additional Focus on their Boss Monster Power Tool Dragon. Let's go into Detail:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Power Tool Path</strong></p><p>In general your focus should be to Build up a Power Tool Dragon or the new Braver Dragon as soon as possible and they are not only great Beatsticks with some Tower Functions. They can also get out the Equip Spells from your Deck fast and make your whole Deck more Consistent.</p><p>2 Power Tool Dragons equipped with their Equip Spell Double Tool C &amp; D can create a perfect attack Wall while guarding themselves from destruction and negating any effect of Monsters they Battle with 3300 ATK. Note that the C &amp; D equip is only usable on the OG Power Tool Dragon or a Morphtronic Machine Monster with LV4 or Higher.</p><p>Power Tool Braver Dragon is missing the protection, that's why you play the Supermagic Sword Raptinus to make up for that. That card feels like written for Morphtronics since it can also change Battle Positions and give an additional Normal Summon. Extreme Life is obviously there to make use of Bravers own negation/battle position change effect to get out Lifestream Dragon, or to just be a imaginary 4k Beater with Card destruction Ability.&nbsp;</p><p>At first sight Power Pickaxe looks like a strange addition but think a moment about it. You can use the effect to Banish a Monster from the opponents GY and gain 500 ATK first and then use Bravers effect to get rid of the Equip Spell for his own effect. Maximum Advantage to be made right there.</p><p>The Power Tool Mecha Dragons can facilitate additional Draw Power if needed. The Lifestream Dragon is useful if many Equip Spells are already in the GY and/or your Life Points are very low. A very good backup Card.&nbsp;</p><p>The one who combines them all is Ultimaya Tzolkin. You will need Lifestream Dragon to summon him in this Deck but once there he can easily summon one Power Tool Monster every turn and get targeting protection too. He even summons Power Tool Braver Dragon and triggers his effect.&nbsp;</p><p>To end this Paragraph see the Power Tools as your Main way to get your Deck going up to speed. They are very important for the Morphtronic Strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Morphtronics arrive</strong></p><p>To even summon Power Tool Boss Monsters you need the help of the Consistency bringers, the Morphtronics. They each have a different Effect based on their current Battle Position. There are numerous ways to get to Level 4, 7, 8 and 9 in this Deck and it's a bit up to luck too.&nbsp;</p><p>Your 3 different Level 1 Telephones bring the Main Search and Summon Power for this Deck. Morphtronic Converter a powerful Spell helps to set up these Monsters and their effects. They require a Die Roll which makes their effects a little luck based but they are all soft once per turns making big Combos very easy.</p><p>But that's not all! The Scannen can search for Spells &amp; Traps, while the Scopen can set up a instant level 7 Synchro summon. Remoten also has applications in that area.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's still not all. There's also Gadgets which support this Archetype. Gadget Gamer being the best one, again setting up for a L7 Synchro Summon and searching your Level 1 Starters. Gadget Box is always treated as Morphtronic Card and is easy to access through Scannen and is basically an additional L1 special summon every turn in form of a Token.</p><p>With all these tools you will be easily summoning multiple Power Tool Monsters in one turn. But what if I tell you that's not the only way to go?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Morphtronics Strike Back!</strong></p><p>Now with all this Consistency it's obvious you will have Space for another Main Deck Strategy. The Direct Attack OTK! Morphtronic Boarden allows every Morphtronic to attack directly. Boomboxen can attack twice and is a legal target for the equip C &amp; D and Radion is a 800 ATK Boost for all Morphtronics. The Field Spell is another 300 ATK on top, every time you change a Battle Position.&nbsp;</p><p>With all that said it's very easy to reach 8000 total Damage through direct attacks to OTK the opponent. When the opponent is to focused on your Power Tool Boss Monsters surprise him with this Backup Plan. This is also highly effective to get past unbeatable Towers and win like that and it's easy to set up within one turn too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Additional Spice is always good</strong></p><p>So the Telefon FTK is well known but not part of this pure Variant... BUT Morphtronic Clocken can Deal 1000 DMG by tributing itself (Or more if you wait many turns) and you can loop that effect a few times too. All depends on you rolling a 2 or Higher and having the means to re summon Telefon and Clocken multiple times. Convoluted for sure but effective nontheless. It does make the Direct attack OTK even more dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Trap Impact Return is a quick effect Speed reborn from the GY or the Banished pile and can shuffle back S &amp; Ts from the opponent on activation. This card is 110% useful I can't even explain it all here.&nbsp;</p><p>Staplen can create a Attack Wall like C &amp; D when combined in any way you desire. One Staplen and one C &amp; D = Attack Wall. Slingen is a little Removal Tool. Earfon is the L4 Synchro useful in many Situations, especially to use Braver Dragons effect many times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So it's the best Deck ever right?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No not at all. All these Combos described can be easily stopped with all the usual stuff like Nibiru and Floodgates. Having to rely and Die Rolls and having some weird downsides/costs on some cards make this Deck miss the Mark to reach the Overpowered territory. It's a Combo Deck in it's Core.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>Morphtronics are fun. You have many possible Combinations within this Deck and can surprise your opponent with unusual ways and Cards. Try this Deck if you like bigger Combo Decks that aren't super complicated to understand. I really liked them ever since their Anime Debut and maybe you too will find them to be fun to play^^&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★★☆☆</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

That results in one <em>Askaan </em>-&gt; <em>Big Ghoti</em> on your opponents turn. If you have either <em>Snopios </em>or <em>Zep </em>in your hand you can also summon a <em>White Aura Whale</em> afterwards. I am not a fan of the combo-on-your-own-turn-with-Coelecanth-variant, as <em>Big Ghoti</em> also banishes your own cards, and then all the cool set-up would go to waste.</p><p><em>Shif </em>is the best of the Ghoti Tuners due to being able to banish itself from the GY. <em>Paces </em>is probably the worst one, as it cannot banish itself from the GY, only from field. <em>Zep </em>only works when banished on your opponents turn, which is good and bad. <em>Ixeep </em>summons itself when added by the Field Spell, similar to Salamangreat Gazelle. <em>Snopios </em>is very good, as it can add itself back to hand. <em>Eanoc </em>is bad, same for the traps.</p><p><em>Lifeless Leaffish</em> can either set up <em>White Mirror</em> or send <em>Shif </em>so you can banish it and make <em>Arionpos </em>-&gt; <em>Askaan/Whale</em> on your opponents turn (via <em>Zep</em>). <em>Silent Angler</em> is just an easy extender, but be careful with it's summonlock. <em>Beautunaful Princess</em> get's you any fish you want/need and is summonable with <em>One for One</em>. </p><p><em>Supay </em>is <strong>really </strong>good, as it get's you any Lv. 6 Synchro, which is nbasically all you want to do turn 1.</p><p><em>White Mirror</em> is an insanely good card, a perfect extender that also gets you follow-up. The fieldspell is also really good and does basically anything the deck wants.</p><p><em>Arionpos </em>banishes you either your tuners, or you can banish <em>Snopios</em>, banish a tuner from GY and then add <em>Snopios </em>to hand. It also searches you <strong>any</strong> fish by banishing a fish with same or lower level when it is used as Synchromaterial. <em>Askaan </em>usually banishes itself and an opponents card, and then it can come back. it revives itself no matter from where it is banished, so you can revive it on your turn again with e.g. <em>Snopios</em>. <em>Big Ghoti</em> is insane. Just banish everything and then hit your opponent for like 5000 ATK. <em>Guoglim </em>is... really bad. There are some set-ups with it when you have <em>Arionpos </em>+ a Tuner on your turn. But it's better to just make <em>Dragite</em>. <em>White Aura Whale</em> is... insane. You Lightning-Storm your opponent, do piercing on 2 monsters, and revive yourself... without a OPT. But be careful, the on-summon effect can miss timing. <em>Chengying </em>is a good Lv. 10 to make on your own turn, as you bansih a lot, so you can easily trigger it and reduce the stats of opponents cards by a lot. <em>Stardust Charge</em> is there because sometimes you need to clean up a board of a lot of small monsters, and you sometimes need another Lv. 6 Synchro. <em>Keeper </em>and <em>Cerberus </em>are there to out e.g. <em>Bagooska</em>.</p><p>Play handtraps/staples at your own leisure.</p><p>The deck is surprisingly good, and I think whis is the way to play it atm. But we need an additional wave of good Ghoti cards so that it becomes really good. The cards are often in their own way and underpowered (e.g. <em>Zep </em>can banish itself from hand and one fish from your GY, but not as a quick effect. <em>Shifs</em> ATK boost is SS1 and only until end of turn, etc.). So I hope we get more cards for them</p>"

Here's my list, as well as an extensive, in depth guide on how to play the deck! CHOO CHOO!","<p>This is the build of Rank 10 Trains (AKA Earth Machine) that I've used to make it all the way to Platinum on Master Duel.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>OVERVIEW:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Rank 10 Trains is a beatdown deck that's main gameplan is to rely on sheer brute force and is capable of achieving easy OTK's as early as turn 1! The deck is very simple to pick up and play, but is very difficult to fully master. Games with Trains almost never last more than a few turns, making it the perfect deck to use for ladder climbing.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>GOING FIRST:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If you're on the play, your gameplan is to always summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=49032236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49032236.jpg"" data-card=""49032236"" data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</span></a> ASAP.&nbsp;</p><p>With <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=49032236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49032236.jpg"" data-card=""49032236"" data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</span></a> you have what many duelists consider to be the ""true Boss Monster"" of the archetype. Juggernaut may be the win condition, but Number 81 is your true workhorse and backbone. Under most normal circumstances, you almost always want to summon Number 81 in Defense Mode if you're going first.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes Number 81 so dangerous as an opening lead is it's resiliance and Spell Speed 2 ability to react to the opponent and bunker itself in and become a truly unkillable monster. Number 81's ability gives it an immunity to literally every single effect.&nbsp;</p><p>How can we abuse this to our advantage? With <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=13647631"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/13647631.jpg"" data-card=""13647631"" data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Heavy Freight Train Derricrane</span></a> of course! Derricrane is the linchpin to the deck. Combined with the Quick Effects of Number 81, detaching Derricrane gives you some reactionary spell speed 2 destruction. A single well timed Number 81 + Derricrane can criple an enemy's combo. And now you're pulling WAY ahead with an unkillable 4000 DEF wall.&nbsp;</p><p>To give yourself an even bigger, backbreaking disruptive advantage; we have one of the most useful and underrated Trap cards at our disposal: <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=22866836"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22866836.jpg"" data-card=""22866836"" data-name=""Spin Turn"">Spin Turn</span></a>!&nbsp;</p><p>If <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=22866836"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22866836.jpg"" data-card=""22866836"" data-name=""Spin Turn"">Spin Turn</span></a> is in your opening hand, summon your Number 81 in ATK Mode, so we can make full use of Spin Turn. Also, if you plan on using Spin Turn, make sure to activate Spin Turn before activating Number 81. This way you can swap 81 into defense mode before it becomes immune to all effects.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>GOING SECOND:&nbsp;</strong>When Trains are on the draw, they become one of the most lethal and consistent OTKs in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Under normal circumstances, our gameplan is to present a turn 1 kill.

A well timed Trap Card or Quick Effect can stop Juggernaut from ending the game.&nbsp;<br />This is especially true the higher up the ranks you get.

Quickly equip Heavy Forward to your Number 81 as an extra XYZ material. Because having 3 XYZ Material on Number 81 is way more important than people realize.</p><hr /><p><strong>LATE GAME:&nbsp; </strong>The late game should be spent being belligerent and using your massive Trains to trample over your opponent's monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>An interesting quirk I've noticed about modern Yu-Gi-Oh cards is that less and less monsters are being printed with the ""can't be destroyed by battle"" ability. Which we can use to our advantage, and for the monsters in the game that can't be destroyed by battle? Don't worry! Most boss monster ATK points cap at 3000, while yours can reach numbers quadruple that!</p><p>What makes Trains so enjoyable is that you very rarely have to worry about opposing boss monster special abilities that prevent them from being targeted or destroyed by effects. All you need to do is make a big train with more than 3k atk and crash into everything. Popular decks like Dragon Maids, Blue-Eyes, Red-Eyes, Thunder Dragons, Adamancipators, Sky Strikers, Odd-Eyes and Dark Magicians simply cannot face Trains in a head to head battle.

It has a massive trouble against Kaijus and can't compete with decks that focus on nothing but early game disruption. It also does not like cards that manipulate attributes because it requires such a high volume of Earth Machines. It also can't afford to cut core cards because it requires such a high density of specific machines to make the deck work. So it is very hard to find room for cards that Trains desperately want to use.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sideboard is full cards that I believe can remedy these weaknesses as best as we can.&nbsp;</p><p><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=60879050"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/60879050.jpg"" data-card=""60879050"" data-name=""Train Connection"">Train Connection</span></a> : Useful as an extra way to beat over problem boss monsters who think they can grow bigger than <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26096328"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26096328.jpg"" data-card=""26096328"" data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</span></a>, hooking Juggernaut up with a Train Connection makes Juggernaut capable of hitting for 16000ATK!

This monster has an Ignition Effect that allows it to set up to 4 ""Rescue-ACE"" Quick-Play Spells and/or Normal Traps directly from the Deck per turn. The other cards in the deck support this card advantage by providing utility, consistency, recovery, and additional swarming options.<br /><br />The ""Rescue-ACE"" monster lineup includes Main Deck Machine and Warrior monsters. The Level 3 and 4 Warrior monsters have a Quick Effect that allows them to Tribute themselves from the hand or field to Special Summon a Machine ""Rescue-ACE"" monster from the hand, GY, or Deck when the opponent activates a Monster effect on the field. The Level 6 and 7 Machine monsters can be Special Summoned from the hand when a ""Rescue-ACE"" monster is Normal or Special Summoned to the field, other than themselves.<br /><br />The Deck's secondary key monster is ""Rescue-ACE Hydrant,"" which can actively search for ""Turbulence"" and has additional self-protection effects. It also enables additional effects for the Deck's Spell/Traps. The theme's Spell and Trap cards provide control, with Quick-Play Spells and Normal Traps having basic supportive/disruptive effects that are enhanced when ""Rescue-ACE Hydrant"" is on the field. The Field Spell ""Rescue-ACE HQ"" aids in resource management and monster summoning.<br /><br />The inclusion of hand traps such as Nibiru, Ash Blossom, and Impermanence helps to control and disrupt the opponent's board. Therion Regulus is included for its synergy with the Machine-type monsters, acting as a free extender and better disruption. The goal of the deck is to control the opponent and beat them down for the win.</p>"

Surprisingly easy to get both of them out in the same turn, even with Sieger sometimes. A lot of decks run 2x only, but I choose 3 to take advantage of Clockwork Night together with other deck synergies.</p><p>Cyber Dragon Core - Easy search and versatility. Its mandatory effect allows to search for other combo-enablers. The GY effect is broken enough on its own (paired with Clockwork Night, as it extends to complete board clear). Usually searching Cyber Emergency, but able to search for Repair Plant as well (if you have the other one in your hand already, as you're only allowed to play one Emergency per turn). Almiraj succeeds in getting rid of it to enable Repair Plant activation, we always want Cyber Dragon(s) in the GY.</p><p>Cyber Dragon Herz - I run 3x in a deck without Clockwork, but here, 2x is enough. Send it to the GY for Cyber Dragon search, push for Galaxy Soldier (fastest Nova-Infinity out) and get the <em>omni-negate&nbsp;</em>out. Foolish runs good here if you don't manage to pull Galaxy Soldier in the starting hand.</p><p>Galaxy Soldier - 2x is just fine, you don't need 3x. Pair him with Cyber Dragon Herz for search and XYZ summon, not much to say.</p><p>Cyber Dragon Nachster - Only one needed. Had to make room for Clockwork, otherwise I'd run 2x at least. Its effect is nifty and allows a bit of tiptoeing around opponent's negates and traps.</p><p>Cyber Eltanin - Board wipe, plus you get your machines in banish so you can use with with Cyberload Fusion and/or Overload Fusion for Chimeratech Overdragon.</p><p>Ghost Belle - Can be easily swapped with Ash Blossom. I went for 1x Ghost Belle because there's no place for 3x Ash and we want to keep deck at 40.</p><p>Jizukiru - Self-explanatory. Also, it's a machine- you're able to&nbsp;<em>contact fuse</em> It. (You can also search it with Repair Plant, just like Galaxy Soldier or Eltanin)</p><p>Clockwork Night - Complete board clear. Contact fuse everything they got and get Chimeratech Fortress Dragon with 5000 ATK / 5000 DEF out easily. Therion King Regulus would be a good search for this, but I really don't own him so I've just built a deck around Cyber Dragon(s).</p><p>Cyber Emergency - A combo starter if you open with it. Search anything that allows you to combo further.</p><p>Machine Duplication - Get your Cyber Dragons out.</p><p>Power Bond - Fuse into Chimeratech Rampage Dragon for OTK (or just use its effect to fend off Herz and, usually, Core).</p><p>Called by the Grave - Good card if you're going second (even first).</p><p>Cyber Repair Plant - Another search for your combo-enablers.</p><p>Cyber Revsystem - In case everything else goes wrong, search it with Core and allow yourself another turn to live with&nbsp;<em>contact fusion.</em></p><p>Cyberload Fusion - Polymerization for Cybers.</p><p>Foolish Burial - Send Herz (or Cyber Dragon for Nachster target).</p><p>Forbidden Chalice - Effect negate.</p><p>Instant Fusion - Panzer Dragon and Chimeratech Rampage target (it can still use its effect to send monsters to the GY).</p><p>Harpie's Feather Duster - Backrow removal.</p><p>Lightning Storm - Removal.</p><p>Limiter Removal - OTK potential (you don't need more, you already got Power Bond and multiple attacks with Chimeratech Rampage Dragon).</p><p>Monster Reborn</p><p>Overload Fusion - Into one of your two DARK machine monsters.</p><p>Raigeki - Removal.</p><p>Twin Twisters - Backrow removal (plus you get the GY effect from Herz or if you need Cyber Dragon in there, maybe even Core).</p><p>Cybernetic Overflow - Excellent card.</p><p>Infinite Impermanence - Read the above.</p><h3>EXTRA DECK</h3><p>Chimeratech Fortress Dragon - I still think 2x is enough, I wouldn't know what to take out for another one either. In a meta as fast as this, you wouldn't see the light to use the third one at all, 2x is just enough.</p><p>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon - Same as the thing above.</p><p>Chimeratech Overdragon - Finisher.</p><p>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon - MVP of this deck.</p><p>Panzer Dragon - hehe.</p><p>Chronomaly Vimana - The only good rank 5 target for your Cybers (since you're not allowed to play 2 Infinities in the same turn).</p><p>Cyber Dragon Nova/Infinity</p><p>Cyber Dragon Sieger - Great card for boosting ATK in the BP (it's considered as ""Cyber Dragon"" as well).</p><p>Linkuriboh - Get rid of your little Cyber that you have left on the field (or if you need to meet the Repait Plant requirement).</p><p>Salamangreat Almiraj - Get rid of your little Cyber that you have left on the field (or if you need to meet the Repait Plant requirement).</p><h3>SIDE DECK</h3><p>Contact ""C""</p><p>Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell - You run a lot of spells. Why not?</p><p>Cosmic Cyclose - If you need more backrow removal.</p><p>Lost Wind - Great card.</p><p>Non-Fusion Area - As dumb as it seems, it doesn't screw you over. You XYZ summon anyway, if it's stopping your opponent from playing, you can play off of Vimana-Nova-Infinity as well as your Link.</p><p>Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror - For DARK users.</p><p>System Down - A lot of consideration went into this one, I just didn't like running it in main deck (even with 3x Clockwork Night in the deck, it just seemed way too unlikely to draw it in your starting hard as well as one of the Clockworks, you have no way for searching either of them out).</p><p>Solemn Judgment - If you're really struggling.</p><h2>Other choices and possibilites</h2><p>Rivalry of Warlords - Tried it. Too bricky, most of the time you don't even need it.</p><p>Of course, you can build a side deck on your own, depending on what you face and play against. I built mine out of cards that I own and that I frequently use against people at locals. Others staples would be favorable.</p>"

Other than the primary dragonmaid engine this deck is outfitted with enough negation cards to allow the user to block most attempts by the opponent to counter play. This deck is weak to flowandreeze and other decks that banish cards as this deck is heavily reliant on graveyard interaction. Use the link monsters especially hieratic seal in order to put cards in the graveyard so then you can summon more monsters during your opponents turn or your following turn if necessary.&nbsp;</p>

It is composed of LIGHT Fairy and DARK Beast Fusion monsters, most of them have 0 ATK (aside from ""Freki the Runick Fangs"" who has 2000), but is almost entirely Spell cards, with no Monster Cards or Trap cards in the main deck. The majority of the Runick cards are Quick-Play Spells, which can disrupt the opponent's plays and banish cards off the top of your opponent's deck, or Special Summon one of their Fusion Monsters from the Extra Deck to an unoccupied Extra Monster Zone. However you can only activate each of the Quick-Play Spells once per turn, and are forced to skip your next Battle Phase after they resolve, a drawback that does not negatively impact them greatly as their monsters will never be doing any attacking themselves. Their main card is the Field Spell ""Runick Fountain"", which they rely on to allow their Quick-Play Spells to be activated from the hand on the opponent's turn and to recycle them, while providing draw power.</p><p>All of the ""Dogmatika"" monsters have effects that counter/disrupt Extra Deck monsters.</p><p>Dogmatika will be both deffense as well as board breakers to throw off you OP strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>think of the deck as a Runick deck with teeth. the objesctive is to deck out your OP, but you can fight back if you have to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>some kinks still need to be workded out.</p>"

This is my 2nd time doing this deck and I think this is the best possible verion of this deck. each card can pretty much combo into anything you want or need as all extra deck cards require Light and/or level 4 monsters. The only problem I've run into with this deck is anything that have more than 3 negates and a monster that is unaffected by card effects and that has a high atk as the highest potential atk this deck can achieve is 4400 with Arcanite magician with Aiwass but no protection, alternatively you can have Zoroa with Aiwass and/or other extra deck cards to have it negate all extra deck monsters matching the same type as the equiped card.</p><p>Aside from those problems I've been able to prevail against many decks specifically those that heavily rely on the extra deck, through the use of magistus, the graveyard, through the use of exosisters, and main decks through the use of everything, primairly from the use of removal by banish by exosisters and inturptions and monster stealing through fusions and big beatsticks by magistus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So far the popular decks I've beaten so far are Floo, Tearlaments, Edlitch, marincess, and labrynth. There are also decent altnerative side cards you can play namely dynatherium, D.D crow, and shallow grave. you can also potentially play quintet magician (Good luck with that) I've found that its most consistant to play it with Keeper of dragon magic and magicalized fusion, as it is a level 4 monster and a spell card that can be used by summoner monk.</p>"

Uses the dogmatika cards as destruction and the subterror cards as banishing and negation. If you want 3 TCBOO, that works, just remember you can only control one copy of each of the three-of in this deck (as always). The reason Kumongous is in the side deck instead of Gameciel is in case you want to use Subterror Succession to search for it (though that requires a higher level Subterror Behemoth, which I haven't put in this deck). It also works in general since it's only 200 ATK above Gameciel.</p><p>Activate Hidden City-&gt;search for Guru (Fiendess if you have Guru, and Nemesis Archer if you have both)-&gt;Set Guru-&gt;Hidden City effect-&gt;Add Fiendess, or Archer, or Final Battle/Cave Clash. Cave Clash can pull off Guru's quick effect without needing another monster. If you can't get Guru on field and Fiendess in hand, then go for the Ecclesia-&gt;Punishment line if you can. I've never used Terrors In the Hidden City, so its use in this Deck is so far unknown.</p><p>There aren't really a lot of FLIP monsters to synergize with in this deck. You could maybe argue the pot of greed FLIP monster, but there really isn't a cheap way to summon it. There are some other decent subterror behemoths, particularly the one that flips all other monsters facedown without targeting, but most other than Umastryx are kinda meh. Umastryx itself is also targeted, but adding Ultramafus can get some untargetable monsters off the field with either Archer or Umastryx. Alternatively, Subterror Succession Ultramafus for Kumongous.</p><p>Harpie's is in side Deck cause this deck can harshly lose to spells and traps- though N'tiss and some other dogmatika cards can help with this as well. One fun thing is that Final Battle can stop the negation effects of Skill Drain, Ash, Called By, and some others as well, which is why it's at 2. Plus, all 4 effects are actually pretty good, and can help you refrain from being defeated quickly.</p>"

We're playing 60 cards becauseThat Grass Looks Greener is legal in this format and we want to take advantage of it to mill 1/3 of our deck and load up our GY with materials for ABC Dragon Buster and trigger Cyber Dragon Herz, maybe mill a target for Nachster as well. Best case scenario, we end on at least 1 ABC Dragon Buster for an interruption, 1 Cyber Dragon infinity for an omninegate, a Cyber Dragon Sieger for battle protection, and an I:P Masquerena so we can potentially make a 4-material Apollousa on our opponents turn using the Machine/Union monsters we summon from the banished zone on our opponents turn using ABC Dragon Buster's second effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of ways you can combo with this deck, some more consistent than others. Ideally, if you open Terraforming/Union Hangar, you'll use your normal summon on either A-Assault Core, B-Buster Dragon, or C-Crush Wyvern, and use Hangar to equip Union Driver, then use Driver's effect to equip another Machine/Union from the deck (one of them should be Buster Drake). Unauthorized Reactivation serves the same purpose. From here you can either make Masquerena or Union Carrier, if you make Carrier you can either equip Photon Orbital in order to search Galaxy Soldier and make Cyber Dragon Infinity, or equip the last Piece you need to make Dragon Buster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't open Hangar or 1 piece+Unauthorized Reactivation, your second best option for a normal summon is Cyber Dragon Core. This lets you search for either Cyber Emergency or Cyber Repair Plant on summon. The former searches a Cyber Dragon monster from the deck, the latter searches any Light Machine if Cyber Dragon is in your GY. Gizmek Yata allows you to summon Buster Drake and Core in the same turn, but it locks you into Machines for the turn, as does Cyber Dragon Nachsters revival effect. The best way to use Nachster is to revive it with Cyber Dragon Nova after making Masquerena or Phoenix, then triggering its revival effect once you don't care about being locked into machines for the rest of the turn.</p><p>We're playing Veiler instead of Imperm because it's a Light monster that synergizes with galaxy soldier Galaxy Soldier. Jizikiru is our Kaiju of choice because we can easily contact-fuse it away with Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, and also because it's a Light. We really want to minimize the number of non-Light monsters in our deck because of Galaxy Soldier. The rest is pretty standard stuff: Foolish to put a Machine/Union/Herz in the GY, One For One does the same thing plus puts a material on board. Some Pot spells for draw power, the 3 Ash, and, of course, we're Maxxed out on the dreaded insect.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>"

Clock worknight comboing with warlords is really good making all their monsters machines and on top of that set rotation is good to lock them out of spells if they do so use it and if not&nbsp; they cant set field spells until they do use it then once used since they have not spellcasters they cant use spell card. It's still and easy otk deck, Plus you may burn them now and use more of the train's. Also you can use superpoly on your cyber cards for rampages effect to fully kick off since they cant negate the summon but they can negate the on field summon effect so careful with that! The rest is to remove problem cards on the field using kaijus or the Chimeratech cards then you can go into rank ten plays. also if they have a kaiju you can summon one if in hand or you can use the spell to pop cards and summon one on yours then one on their's. Leeching the Light can still be played in this too&nbsp; for any of the plays. You are going to make any boss monsters you make gain 3,300 and that all monsters on your field not just one. This deck is more of a stun cuz of the goal is to turn all card machine and lock them out of monster summons and spells then you can burn for 5k with the numerons will only count as 3k plus the trains if you can go into it. You can after that summon a monster and otk even with the low attack cybers cuz of the kaiju and leeching the light also there's nibru with honest gainning his attack. Vipers&nbsp; also alone can otk, One give's a token the other gives attack to light machine monster as you attack. The main combo for this deck is to see one kaiju leeching the light one numeron gate spell and the monster so it can bye pass one negate. Also they can't negate the numeron monster with ashe. And this is the reason you are not adding it. Also you can side out one honest and Nibru for the Hope cards so you can draw..... or not cuz ashe is a thing... if you feel cross out would be better or triple tactic if its better. Use what you can to make it worth the fun.</p>"

Since then they have formed a conglomerate that can even beat the strongest of <em>Tear 0</em> decks (provided your opponent doesn't draw Nibiru, Shifter or Droll &amp; Lock).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck is really fun to play. While the individual engines are striaghtforward, combining the combo lines and trying to figure out how to optimally play a hand feels very rewarding and the deck plays surpisingly different to all currently viable decks.</p><p>The Punk engine brings the explosive combo plays and enable a lot of the other engines.<br />The Adventure engine grants protection and card advantage and enables different combo routes.<br />The Ishizu cards are oviously strong against graveyard reliant decks, but also recycle resources and are searchable (kind of).<br />The Naturia cards are incredibly synergistic and enable some crazy endboards.<br />The Therion engine grants some needed protection after the Vernusylph restriction and also generate a lot of advantage.<br />The Vernusylph cards tie this whole mess together. Hail the <em>DUCK</em>!</p><p>You can put up some really strong boards that are sometimes unbeatable and it doesn't brick as often as you would assume looking at the list. Though it's sometimes impossible to activate some engines depending on the hand. <br />The Punk trap, the searchable Klebek and Mole Cricket allow to play through Dark Ruler and Droplet suprisingly easily. Different setups also make this deck really hard to deal with and sometimes allow for instant wins.<br />Going second also isn't as bad, since you can push through quite a bit of interaction, especially if you draw Vernusylphs in combination with other engines. Resolving the same Scrap Dragon multiple times via the Vernusylphs is not only strong, but also really funny.</p><p>The biggest downside of the deck is that it's almost impossible to side deck. Since 57/60 cards are engine cards and the only non-engine card, Fenrir, might as well be one, there is nothing to be side out. Also considering that it's a 60-card deck means that you have to side in almost all of it, if not in it's entirety, going second. Therefore I build the side in a way were you can either side out the entire adventure engine or the Therion, Ishizu and 1-of Adventure and Deer Note for the entire side before the Lifetrancer.<br />Lifetrancer is your win-con for time, Barrierstatue is an optional win-con going first and Zombie World is GG against Floo.</p><p>Another downside is, that there is no room for tech slots. You might be able to shave some cards to get maybe 2 to 5 slots open, but thats probably it, unless you cut an engine like Therion or Ishizu entirely. You cloud consider to cut the Adventure engine, but the value and protection it grants is most likely too important.<br />The same problem also arises if you consider the ever shifting meta game. Depending on where the meta goes, it could happen that this deck won't be able win a singular match.</p><p>But most importantly is that the acronym is <em><strong>P.A.I.N. T.V.</strong></em>! We are truly blessed by the <em>DUCK</em> for such an acronym!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

That card provides a lot of advantage since it facilitates using Kaiju monsters twice per turn against your opponent since it can bounce it back to your hand. Plus, the card can be easily summoned which faciliates summoning 2 XYZ monsters in one turn.<br /><br />For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

No problem it's Flower Cardian time! No no no wait! It's not as difficult and boring as you think. My goal today is to explain Flower Cardian as simple as possible and tell you why it's so strong, let's start:</p><p><strong>The VERY important Starters</strong></p><p>In this Deck you will find 13 Cards which get things started, every other card is essencially a Brick at first. Sounds terrible but the odds of drawing at least one starter are on your side 90% of the time from my experience.&nbsp;</p><p>For the Spells the 1x Flower Gathering and the 3x Super Koi Koi are the starters. 3x Flower Stacking can prepare a Starter for the following turn if you can survive one turn with an empty board.&nbsp;</p><p>The Monster Starters are the 3x Level 1 Pine (The grey colored one), 3x Cherry Blossom (The red and pink colored one) and 3x Cherry Blossom with Curtain (the purple colored one).&nbsp;</p><p>You have to draw one of these 13 Starters or you can't play the game at all. Flower Stacking kinda brings it to 16 Cards if you manage to survive one turn.</p><p>I don't like playing more then one Flower Gathering since Ash Blossom negates it and it's the only card which doesn't gain advantage of any kind when it's milled to the GY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The general Idea behind the Cardians</strong></p><p>Whenever you summon a Flower Cardian monster you will almost always Draw 1 Card and show it, if it's another Flower Cardian Monster you keep it in your Hand, if it's a Spell you discard it to the Graveyard.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost all Flower Cardian cards have no Once per turn so it's easy to go through your whole 40 card Deck as early as turn one to create big Synchro Boss Monsters.</p><p>You want to use one of the three different tuners which all share the ability to change the level of all Monsters you control to 2 for a Synchro summon to create these Synchro Bosses. That means you have to summon many Cardian Monsters to get out many Synchro Monsters in one turn.&nbsp;</p><p>5 Cardians = LV10 Synchro Monster</p><p>4 Cardians = LV8 Synchro Monster</p><p>3 Cardians = LV6 Synchro Monster</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The three different Cardian types</strong></p><p>Every Cardian can be placed into one of three categories:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The free special summons</strong></p><p>These Cardians can special themselves onto the field when a Cardian with a lower level then themselves already exists on the field. They always have 100 ATK and DEF.</p><p><strong>The one tributes</strong></p><p>These type of Cardians can special themselves by tributing any other Cardian Monster on the field and always draw one card when they are summoned. They always have 1000 ATK and DEF.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The specific tribute ones</strong></p><p>The last type of Cardians can only be special summoned by tributing a Cardian with the same level which is already on the field. They always draw one card on summon and can special the drawn card if it's a monster. They always have 2000 ATK and DEF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Goal for Turn one</strong></p><p>The best thing you can aim for initially is to special summon the 3 Synchro Bosses onto the field. The LV10 Lightflare, LV8 Lightshower and the LV6 Boardefly.&nbsp;</p><p>With that you get a Spell &amp; Trap negation with 5K attack which gives the ability to negate Monster effects during Battle for all Cardians and replaces itself with any other Cardian Synchro Monster if it leaves the field by the opponent.</p><p>A 3K tower that gives targeting and destruction protection to all Cardians and burns the opponent for 1500 during his Draw Phase.&nbsp;</p><p>And a 2K boy who gives piercing to all Cardian Monsters and prevents Monster effects and Special summons from the Graveyard.</p><p>In short a very formidable Board that can easily Deal with Meta threats and easily OTK the opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Additional Spice&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If your Synchro Board gets broken through mainly non targeting Removal you can use the Spell Super All In to revive any 4 Cardian Monsters from the GY and special a 5th by drawing it. The big downside if you fail to draw a Cardian can be prevented with Lightshowers destruction protection (I had to read this 3 times to understand how it works).</p><p>The Maindeck Monsters can change the order of the top 3 cards of the opponents Deck or place them on the bottom. Extremely useful in Master Duel to find out what you are up against.&nbsp;You have access to non targeting Monster and Backrow destruction too. Even a 1000 ATK gain Handtrap is part of the Maindeck lineup and the Moonflowerviewing Synchro can enable a 2k direct attack with her effect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tips from me for beginners with this Deck</strong></p><p>The L6 Synchro Moonflowerviewing can enable a Draw 1 which is 100% safe meaning you don't have to discard the card even if it's a Spell. Very useful if the cards don't fall into your favor to keep advantage going.&nbsp;</p><p>The green colored LV11 Willow Cardian in the Maindeck is very important. His effect allows to recycle 1 Cardian from grave back into the Deck to Draw 1 card. This card draw is 100% safe again so no discarding even if it's a Spell. The level 8 Zebra Grass can also enable safe Draws but is less useful in that regard. Try to loop Willows effect as often as possible by recycling Willow with Willow.</p><p>Don't Panic if you don't find tuners fast enough sometimes. A Board of 5 different 2K beaters is often formidable enough to clear the game too especially with all the non targeting Removal which is accessible for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Special summon the LV10 Synchro first. He's useful for it's negation and ability to be any other Flower Cardian Synchro should he leave the field. Be sure to summon him in the Extra Monster Zone to have space for the others.&nbsp;</p><p>And lastly special your Cardians with 100 ATK in defense. If the opponent interrupts you, you will be glad to have them in defense.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>This Deck doesn't play the Yugioh you know and it somehow works very well. It's easy to reach Diamond in Master Duel with this Strategy but beware your biggest enemy Nibiru. The usual offenders like Kaijus, non targeting Banish and Barrier Statue stun also work well against this Strategy so if you can choose go first.&nbsp;</p><p>You will win many games from the opponent scooping since this Archetype is known for it's long turns. If you want quick wins it's kinda possible with this Deck simply because 50% of the time the opponent will surrender to not watch you go full Combo.&nbsp;</p><p>If you choose to pick this Deck up you will notice how much fun playing Cardians can be (The opponent may have less fun). I like these based on Hanafuda fellas a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★★★☆</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

A true control build with new flair- faster and more oppresive thats for sure!</p><p>The win condition is to control and suppress reaction and board builder up, followed by beatdowns from Fluer, Fenrir, Guru and/or Umastryx.

Often times they are combined with Ancient Gear, Gadgets, Orcust, and even Cyber Dragons; however, today I present to you a strategy meant to cater to putting on full display the capabilities of the Machina force without the assistance of others (barring... some Infinitrack cards because we just need to fill the deck space okay...?) Got it? Good, let me brief you on the deck here:<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Resistance: Formerly used to have a problem against banishing, up until we got Ruinforce to remedy that problem entirely. Now, even if your Machinas are removed from play, you can rely on Ruinforce to put them back in circulation AND trigger any on-summon effects in the process. It's quite potent and makes them a deck that works well regarding both the GY and banished pile. And should your Ruinforce ever be banished, you can just resolve the GY effect of Overdrive to shuffle it back in.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Arsenal: The Infinitracks allow the Machinas to manipulate their levels to access a plethora of toolboxed options in the Extra Deck. Though those options aren't always needed as the Machina cards themselves function very well together to establish a fortification between hand, field, and GY that can be rather annoying to deal with if managed properly. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Easy to Pick Up: Once you get used to the lines and how the cards talk to one another, you'll find that the deck is pretty straightforward to pilot, especially since almost everything in here is an Effect Monster anyway. You'll mostly be rewarded for your usage tactical trades with Fortress or navigating complex gamestates with Air Raider, Irradiator, Resavenger, and the Machina Spell/Trap combo. It sounds like a lot on paper, but it's not too bad... maybe. Look, just find Limiter Removal and use it with Ruinforce to instantly win the duel.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Infinitracks: The Infinitrack Monsters, while great for adding diversity and options to the deck, unfortunately eat up a LOT of summons to get going. It's best to use them as a backup or to establish a River Stormer. If you've got Drill or Harvester, consider just using them to cheat out Xyzs rather than for standard Infinitrack lines. This isn't an Infinitrack-focused deck after all.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Little Protection: The only real searchable protection we have in this deck is through Defense Perimeter's continous benefits and that is more like a lightning rod than a diffuser. You'll want to think with less of a mindset of protecting the castle and more about how to breach the opponent's. Trade well and you'll be rewarded for it. Don't and... it'll be pretty challenging to deal with some backrows and board breaking monsters.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Inconsistent Interaction: All of this deck's ways of dealing with the opponent primarily deal with board-breaking already established boards or hard drawing specific forms of removal. We are playing Harmonizer Gradielle and Tornado Dragon but calling those cards reliable disruption across the board is a little generous. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that the briefing's over, let's get you sortied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br /></p><p>Machina's playstyle is pretty different from its TCG Advance counterpart since we don't have access to Citadel and the crazy setups that card can get up to. Instead, we'll just have to settle for board breaking and mid-range with a pretty decent top end if we happen to go wide with our various Emergency Teleport-like effects. Let's start with the basics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Machina Redeployment: </strong>This card's absurdly potent and enables so many various lines of play that it's honestly baffling that this card is allowed at three copies. Now, the two modes this card offers you are very different in what lines of play you get access to. Starting with the <strong>first mode</strong> of discarding any card, you'll want to grab Machina Gearframe and any other Machina Monster of your choosing that is not Unclaspare. I recommend going for a level 4 like Possesstorage so you have a follow-up play or Resavenger so you can opt to just stop on two monsters, or potentially three if you opened one that can Special Summon itself. Use Gearframe to grab Unclaspare then use its effect to summon itself from the hand. Bin either Fortress or Ruinforce and decide if you'll go into Gear Gigant X or not. If you do, you'll want to use Gear to pick up Ancient Gear Box and usually Anchor Drill to have a guaranteed Rank 4 or 8 follow-up play with no restrictions. The other targets for Gigant X are also valid, but this option's definitely the safest one to go with in most scenarios. Regarding the <strong>second mode </strong>will depend a lot on the Machina card that is discarded, but for simplicity's sake, let's just assume it's a card that is a Monster not named Ruinforce. You'll want to pick up Possesstorage and Machina Overdrive. You'll just toss down Possesstorage and loop the monster back then set Overdrive and you're good to go in the simplest of cases. Use Overdrive to pivot into either Fortress, Air Raider, or Metalcruncher as necessary. If you're looking for something more aggresive, feel free to go for an early Fortress play with Redeployment and pick up Defense Perimeter. This will make it so that Fortress is always the attack target for your little guys and will draw all monster targeting effects, helping to resolve its handloop effect at resolution. That a lot to take in? Well it shouldn't be, it's the first card we've talked about thus far!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Machina Overdive:</strong> Sometimes you don't open too well or just need a way to catch up quickly because you've bricked on a high level Machina. You'll use Overdrive to tag into Metalcruncher then pick up Gearframe, Ancient Gear Box, or Flying Pegasus. If you have a Machina in hand you'll also want to consider Air Raider and Irradiator as they enable some pretty fantastic pivots when playing from behind to quickly get back into the game. Pegasus can be used with Metalcruncher to Earthslice the board apart or explore a number of other Xyz options to deal with the opponent's armada. Box's virtually the same way, picking up Anchor Drill, but if you're really far behind consider going for Gigant X and finding Gearframe to get your Machinas continuing to cycle.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Dragonlark Pairen:</strong> If you happen to find yourself in a scenario where you have Harvester but no way to benefit from it because the levels are 6 when combined, then you can go into Pairen. With the first Harvester search, ideally you'll pick up Brutal Dozer, but if you need a discard outlet for whatever reason, you'll go with Trencher instead. Then, during the opponent's Standby Phase, you'll use the detach effect to detach Harvester and pick up another search which will usually be Anchor Drill. If the other material attached to Pairen is worth summoning back as well, then by all means feel free to go for that one instead. Pairen will inherently protect itself and draw aggression while also redirecting things back to your resurrected monster, giving you some time to be in the driver's seat and fill up your hand a bit despite not actually putting up a form of disruption. Neat huh?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The openings won't always need to be the same, but they are extremely consistent which feels refreshing when it comes to limited formats where most of the cards are one-ofs so you'll often find no two openers looking the same. Once you're more comfortable with identifying your Air Raiders from your Irradiators and such you'll pick up your own openers that best suit your hand and opponent to better accomodate the Machina strategy.<br /><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />Most midgames with the deck will just feature you going quite wide or having game planned ahead by a couple moves and setting up Ruinforce in GY to be there when it's time to throw down. As such, the plays featured in this section will mostly just highlight some of the all-stars that could be easily missed at a glance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Double Headed Anger Knuckle: </strong>You'll only really go for this with Super Express Bullet Train unless you've got a cheeky Knightmare Unicorn play in mind. You'll want to keep looping the two together to get free cards back from your GY thanks to Bullet Train's EP effect. Combine this with Ancient Gear Box in the GY and you'll be turning that add back from the GY into a search from the deck! </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Dhampir Vampire Sheridan: </strong>This card breaks boards and outs things like Dark End Dragon... then can also just steal them like Goyo Guardian- huh. In any case, this card's great to go into with a mid-game Harvester for putting a dent in your opponent's defenses if you can't amass the levels to go into something like a Dingirsu who will give you a similar benefit but will provide your field with passive protection instead or Sky Dragon Overlord to protect your board and GY from being banished and bounced around. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Machina Resavenger: </strong>Combined with your offensive, this card can really just be a nuisance and turn your Machinas into much, much stronger threats than what your opponent is comfortable with running into or being run over by. Using it to overpower something Honest-style will just add it back to hand too, re-establishing its presence and putting you further in control. If you ever happen to lose it too, you can always fetch it back with Irradiator, Possesstorage, and Defense Perimeter.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />This deck doesn't really fancy a grind game, so the next section is more so dedicated to some clean finisher options to look out for.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Machina Ruinforce: </strong>This card's absolutely bloated with all sorts of benefits and perks and it's all the better when actually played with Machinas because it has such a massive target on its back that demands it be answered. You'll want to plan ahead with your levels banished to summon it usually with a Possesstorage, Fortress, or Metalcruncher so that way when Ruinforce gets ruined, you can have a really strong recovery to keep up the pressure and come out on top regarding the trade. Once you enter the battle phase, do not be afraid of anything at all. Paying half your LP will hardly matter in most games, especially since it halves your opponent's LP by the same effect. With this monster being a 1 Summon 4.6k beatstick, that means once the BP is entered, you can freely clear anything you'd like to (and even use fast effects like Tornado Dragon, Overdrive, and other things) and not have to worry about the opponent responding because if they do, they probably lose immediately.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Limiter Removal: </strong>Does this card really need any introduction?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Liebe: </strong>This one's a little tricky to setup since we're not a Rank 10 Railway build but it's definitely an option thanks to the Infinitracks and Pegasus. This will primarily be setup from an Anger Knuckle play or Urgent Schedule on your opponent's turn, then on your turn you'll go into Gangaridai and blow something up (ideally backrow) for 1k damage, then go into Liebe and swing for game. Just remember that Liebe only gets the bonus attacks against monsters, not just in general.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />The lines presented by the Machina archetype are really consistent, resilient, and flexible, sporting a variety of options and synergies that only continue to improve as the cardpool expands. Thanks to these qualities and Konami's unification of Machines in general, you can try some of the following things to switch up your approach on Machina here:<br /><br /><em>Allure of Darkess, Mekk-Knight, Orcust, Cyber Dragon &amp; Clockwork Night, Revolving Switchyard, Fossil Fusion, Gadgets, Crystrons, Ancient Gear, and EARTH Tuners for Naturia Barkion.<br /></em><br />And that's the end of this transmission, Cadet. Hope all of that information wasn't too much for you. Believe me when I say it's a lot easier than it reads- epsecially when it comes to scenarios after resolving Redeployment the first time in a game. I'll continue to iterate on strategies and post guides here, you should probably leave this Armored Unit now. We'll want you in Megaform if you ever want to promote from a Soldier to an Air Raider- all in the name of being a Peacekeeper of course!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
