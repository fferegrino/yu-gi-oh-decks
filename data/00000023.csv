So are huge monsters! So turn Toon Kingdom's cost into a benefit for Gren Maju da Eiza and Eater of Millions.  Doesn't scale fast enough? Throw in pot of desires to both make it easier to draw into something to find a Toon Kingdom and to supercharge your Gren Maju.  Interested in defense? Just stick a Lvl 4 Toon Monster with Toon Kingdom and wait for the payoff. Do additional deck filtering with the strange Goblin Circus, or shut down opponent removal forever with Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell - especially since you don't always need your second Toon Table of Contents.  &nbsp;  A little hard to call this casual with the cost of Toon Black Luster Soldier and Toon Bookmark. Toon Black Luster Solider isn't required, though. Just swap him out for some more Lvl 4 Toons. One of his bigger benefits is that he doesn't need Toons on the field in order to jump in. Also feel free to add in Toon Page Flip if you want to juice it up even more."

Almost like modern day dinosaurs, thoses (almost all the time) little creatures are in every continent of our world while being one of the most common animals that you’ll see.</span>  <span>One of the most famous birds is the not so impressive </span><b>Arctic tern </b><span>(</span><i><span>Sterna paradisaea) </span></i><span>, a bird that flies enormous distances compared to another being, almost 70. 000 kilometers (in normal units) or 46. 000 miles (in burguer units), travelling literare around the world. And that journey, my fellow traveler, is where </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>starts.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Let’s begin our journey</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Above everything, the </span><b>Floowandereeze archetype</b><span> is about a journey of 3 littler Arctic terns (the </span><b>Floowandereezes)</b><span> flying in their migratory route, from Greenland or Iceland to the Antarctic continent. It has a control style of play, with so many cards that are stalls on leg, like  </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a> </b><span> who prevents any special summon  monsters from active its effect while in atk mode or, </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"">Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl</a> </b><span>who is a evolution of</span><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Ultimate Conductor Tyranno&lt;/b&gt;""> <b>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</b></a><b>, </b><span>that can flip face down any special summon monster  in your opponent field. But how does this deck work?</span>  <span>Unlike any other meta contender this deck doesn't perform any special summon. At first this sounds weird, doesn't it? But don’t fear, my fellow traveller,because our destiny point will guide us along the way. Every low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster has the effect that when you normal summon it an effect is activated and soon after you can perform another normal summon, with the down side that prevents you to special summon in this turn.</span><span> Furthermore, when they leave the field they go to the banned pile instead of  GY, while letting your GY completely empty. Thus , you lose your monster , right? WRONG!!  When you normal summon a winged beast monster the can be added to hand once more, even if it were tributed in this right moment.</span><span> “</span><i><span>The best way to describe Flundereeze is if a True Draco player and a monarch player made custom cards together” </span></i><span> once said </span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/giogio/""><b>GioGio</b></a><span>.</span>  <span>We have cards like </span><b></b><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Floowandereeze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp; Eglen&lt;/b&gt;""><b>Floowandereeze</b><b> &amp; Eglen</b></a><b> (</b><span>representing the USA) and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Floowandereeze &amp; Robina</a> (</b><span>representing England) </span><b>, </b><span>that are starters of this deck . The first one searches any Winged-best with +7 star then you can normal summon winged beast monster from your hand, and the latter one can search any -4 star from you deck then normal summon any  winged beast monster from you hand. That is superb because </span><b>Robina </b><span>can used as an extender to add </span><b>Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds or D. D. Crow </b><span> to your hand, and summon it after you out a big board monster or you can search any low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> to help in yours plays; </span><b>Eglen </b><span>in other hand bring to you hand cards like the already mentioning </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"">Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl</a> </b><span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a>, </b><span> and further cards like </span><b><a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>, </b><span> the </span><b>Apex </b><span>being a excellent negate and </span><b>Simorgh, Lord of the Storm </b><span> a really annoying card, but almost every time you’ll search </span><b>Empen,</b><span> because it has an ability of search any spell / trap </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> card.</span>  <span>Other low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monsters are </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan"">Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan</a> </b><span>(representing my home country, Brazil)</span> <span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Stri"">Floowandereeze &amp; Stri</a> </b><span>(representing the Sahel region from Africa, possibly Sengal or  Mauritania). </span><b>Toccan</b><span> can add any </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>card that is banished to your hand then soon after normal summon any winged monster from your hand;  The angry </span><b>Stri is your</b><span> portable</span><b> D. D. Crow, </b><span> that can banish any card from either Gy to perform its </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>effect</span> <span>being a powerful interrupt in the opponent turn. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>The friends along the way</b>  &nbsp;  <span>As I said before, the GY is empty , so you can use the most devilish tech in this format, </span><b><a data-name=""Dimensional shifter"">Dimensional shifter</a></b><span>, a portable  </span><b><a data-name=""macro cosmo"">macro cosmo</a> that</b><span> can literally extort your opponent to pass his/her turn. And the most deadly of all, you can use it further down the duel because you GY will be almost every time empty.  Did This angry dude mess with this deck? Absolutely no, he is almost an  honorable  </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster.</span>  <span>Pots will be our “baggage” in specific: </span><b><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality .</a> </b><span>The first one would be better if were a Prosperity, but you can never complain about what you have, and the second one is perfect since you don’t have to special summon. They can fulfill your hand in no time and accelerate your plays. Another special  baggage is </span><b><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></b><span>, an awesome card to search any low level </span><b>Floowandereeze.</b>  <span>Our map to fortune is </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map"">Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map</a>,</b><span> which (alongside </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town</a>)</b><span> is one of the most powerful items in your journey. It grants you the ability to have an extra normal summon by revealing a </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster and banishing a different  </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>card  from your deck and then normal summoning that first monster... phew... and if you a another low level </span><b>Floowandereeze, </b><span> you can add to your hand by its effect and is not over yet: if your opponent normal summon a monster , you can normal summon a </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster from your hand, in another word, in case that your opponent interrupt your plays you can know play in his/her turn like nothing really happened. </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town</a> </b><span> does the same thing, with an additional effect that you can banish this card and flip face down every monster that were special summon  in your opponent turn. Both of these cards are what make this deck so fearsome to play against.</span>  <span>For our final </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> card we have </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds"">Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds</a>: </b><span>an archetype Soul exchange card. Not so useful , but come on… that’s a really good looking card, like a good summer’s sunset after a really long year in school.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Spice tech!!!</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a>: </b><span>damn you sword so players!!</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a>: </b><span>since its extra deck doesn’t matter I decide to throw this deck on the side, making your opponent sweat in the process;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: </b><span> These cards work amazingly with this deck , since almost all monsters are WIND winged beasts, and </span><b>Harpie's Feather Storm </b><span>is basically a skip a turn, definitely 3 of,  and finally can search </span><b>Harpie's Feather Duster </b><span>if destroyed.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Combos</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Basic combo: using just one </span><b>Robina</b> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Normal summon </span><b>Robina</b><span> an then search </span><b>Eglen;</b></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Immediately normal summon </span><b>Eglen </b><span>that you searched and then search </span><b>Empen;</b></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Immediately tribute summon </span><b>Empen;</b></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Chain link 1 </span><b>Empen</b><span>, chain link 2 </span><b>Robina</b><span>, chain link 3 </span><b>Eglen;</b></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Eglen</b><span> and</span><b> Robina</b><span> go to your hand, </span><b>Empen</b><span> searches <b>dreaming town</b></span><b>;</b></li> </ol> <span>Map+Robina: 1xMagnificent map+1Robina</span> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Activate </span><b>Map</b><span>, use its effect revealing </span><b>Robina</b><span>, banish </span><b>Eglen</b><span> from your deck and immediately summoning </span><b>Robina</b><span>;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Chain link 1 </span><b>Robina </b><span>chain link 2 </span><b>Eglen</b><span>;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Eglen goes to your hand, robina searches </span><b>Barrier statue of the Stormwinds</b><span> then immediately summons </span><b>Eglen</b><span>;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Eglen </b><span>searches </span><b>Empen</b><span>, immediately tribute summon </span><b>Empen</b><span>;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Cl1 </span><b>Empen</b><span>, cl2 </span><b>Robina</b><span>, cl3 </span><b>Eglen</b><span>;</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Eglen</b><span> and </span><b>Robina</b><span> go to the hand, </span><b>Empen</b><span> searches </span><b>dreaming town</b><span> then immediately summons </span><b>Barrier statue of the Stormwinds;</b></li> </ol> <b><i>Thanks <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/giogio/"">GioGio</a> for help figure out this combos (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/flundereeze-x-dogmatika-in-depth/"">Link for his/her deck</a>)</i></b>  <b>Conclusion</b>  <span>After this amazing journey we stand upon this magnificent view, ICE, ICE everywhere,even because we arrived in Antarctica, land of the penguin ahaha.

And also a Fate/Grand Order reference.),"  My third Albaz deck in a row this week. For today, I got an Eldlich Albaz deck profile, named after one of Japan's most famous fairy tales and Fate/Grand Order's strongest Servants, Sakata Kintoki. AKA, the Golden Boy!  ...I'm not even joking. Kintoki's original name ""Kintaro"" literally means ""Golden boy"" in Japanese. And his father was a dragon, while his mother was a man-eating witch. So the name is kind of appropriate.  &nbsp;  Although this deck runs a total of 12 hand traps--14 if you count Eldlich the Golden Lord, you would rather be going first most of the time so you can set up as many negates and disruptions as possible. Eldlich is one of the best monsters to send to the Graveyard with Branded Fusion, since it can then revive itself if you send a set Spell/Trap on your field to the Graveyard.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

No combos, no confusing or complicated card effects. Just really stupid big beatsticks. This is the First real deck I made, and it's kinda ironic that it's also probably the last deck I publish here.

Well, after finally entering the last weeks of school I finally have some time to bring you said decklists. Also, I mentioned there would be changes in how I would continue this challenge, in the form of 2 new rules:  - Almost all Structure Decks have a portrait monster that indicates the Structure Deck's boss monster(s). So, for every decklist for this challenge from now on most feature said monster at 3 copies. In case that more than 1 monster is featured, to add a bit of difficulty, you can only use a combination of 3 cards among those monsters but all must be featured. Lastly, the entire playstyle of the decklist must play around either that monster(s) playstyle or turbo-ing out ASAP.  - To give more ambience to the Decklists for the time they were printed, depending if they have Extra Deck monsters and the time they dayviewed, the status of the Extra Deck will change. For example: Zombie Madness will not feature an Extra Deck, Zombie World will have one, but made mostly of not-so-recent Synchros and Fusions; and Zombie Horde giving that it is the most recent one has an Extra Deck with any kind of card.  So, with these explanation cleared, I bring to you the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong> for the <strong>Zombie Madness Structure Deck</strong>.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> As its name states, Zombie Madness is a Structure Deck based around a Zombie-themed Deck. Giving how old this Deck was printed, it did help to show how even today Zombies' playstyle, being having a lot of GY plays.  This decks' boss monster is <strong>Vampire Genesis</strong>. Is a Level 8 DARK Zombie monster with 3000 ATK/2100 DEF and it cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, must be Special Summoned from the hand by banishing 1 Vampire Lord you control and cannot be summoned by other ways. OPT: You can discard 1 Zombie monster to target another one in your GY with a lower Level than the discarded monster and Special Summon it. <strong>Vampire Lord</strong> is a Level 5 DARK Zombie with 2000 ATK/1500 DEF. If it inflicts battle damage to the opponent: You can declare either Monster/Spell/Trap cards; then your opponent must send to the GY one card of the type declared, at their choice. Also, if this card was destroyed by and opponent's card effect: It Special Summon itself back during your next Standby Phase. There's a high chance you might not recognize either of them if you played/played against current-time Vampire decks giving that both monsters can't help out with their new playstyle even if they have good Levels for their Xyz. However, said Vampire support can help out to search them out and some of the support from this same Structure Deck can cheat out Lord a bit faster.  As for their playstyle, it revolves around Special Summoning Zombie monsters and milling. Yes, milling is also consider to be Zombie's secondary playstyle.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>***Vampire Genesis</strong>: Main Boss Monster of the Deck. Largest body and can bring Zombies from the GY. <strong>*Dark Dust Spirit</strong>: When Normal Summoned or flipped, it destroys all other face-up monsters on the field. One off as an emergency nuke giving its Spirit monster nature. <strong>***Vampire Lord</strong>: Necessary to summon Genesis, easy to summon and tolerable stats/self-revival. <strong>***Pyramid Turtle</strong>: When destroyed by battle, it can float into any Zombie monster from your Deck with 2000 or less DEF. Except for Genesis, it can float into any Zombie from this Deck, more importantly Lord and Spirit Reaper. <strong>***Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower</strong>: Cannot be targeted for attacks if you control another Zombie monster, including another copy of itself so you can prevent your opponent from attacking them at all. Also, each time you Special Summon a Zombie monster on your field, it mills the top 2 cards from your opponent's Deck. <strong>***Spirit Reaper</strong>: Cannot be destroyed by battle, but it self-destructs if it is targeted by a card effect. Mainly used for stalling out battles. <strong>**Vampire Follower</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs ""Vampire"" backrow when Special Summoned and it can revive itself from the GY. <strong>**Vampire Familiar</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs ""Vampire"" monsters when Special Summoned and it can revive itself from the GY. Main searcher for Genesis and Lord. <strong>***Allure of Darkness</strong>(Outside Support): Giving that this deck runs a lot of DARK monsters, it adds that necessary draw power. <strong>***Book of Life</strong>: It targets a Zombie on your GY and one monster on your opponent's GY, then it Special Summons the first target while banishing the second. A brick on turn 1 but useful later. <strong>***Mystical Space Typhoon</strong>: Quick-play backrow removal. <strong>***Call of the Mummy</strong>: Basically Valhalla for Zombie monsters. <strong>*Vampire Kingdom</strong>(Outside Support): Boosts Zombie monsters and turns Lord's and Bone Tower's mill effect into a potential destruction effect as well. <strong>*Vampire Takeover</strong>(Outside Support): Activates Kingdom from the Deck and revives a ""Vampire"". One of Follower's main searchs. <strong>*Vampire Awakening</strong>(Outside Support): Special Summons a ""Vampire"" monster from the Deck but destroys it during the End Phase. Useful to summon Familiar/Follower to search. <strong>***Torrential Tribute</strong>: Another emergency board wipe. <strong>**Compulsory Evacuation Device</strong>: Targeted bouncing effect."

If haven't read the new rules for this challenge, I'll summarize:  - The built decks now must focus on the main boss monster's playstyle and must be featured at 3 at all times. - The Extra Deck must be built around if the Deck even has Extra Deck monsters or had access to depending the era it was printed.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> Being printed during the 5D's era, Zombie World bring a whole new wave of support to the Zombie playstyle, mostly the GY manipulation part, and decides to add new cards that interact with Zombie monsters from your opponent's GY. How? Because of the namesake of this Deck is printed, <strong>Zombie World</strong>. It also decides to add a new playstyle to the Zombie mechanics, that being changing the types of all monsters to Zombies and stealing monsters from the opponent's GY.  Their featured Boss Monster is <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>. Is a Level 7 DARK Zombie with 2400 ATK/2000 DEF that can be Tribute Summoned in Attack Position using only 1 Zombie monster as Tribute. When it destroys a Zombie monster by battle and sends it to the GY: You can Special Summon it to your field. Like a repeating case with the last decklist, this deck offers another ways to Summon him quicker, although its summoning condition is not that restrictive either. If you're crazy enough, I guess you can mix Red-Eyes support to this build to search him faster or reviving him, but I'll leave that to your preference.  Giving that this deck was printed during the 5D's era, it will feature some Synchros and Fusion monsters, but I enssured no way-too-recent monsters were on it.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>Main Deck:</strong> <strong>***Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>: Main Boss Monster. It steals any Zombie monster it destroys by battle and is fairy easy to summon. <strong>***Paladin of the Cursed Dragon</strong>: Solid Level 4 beater. Can revive any Level 4 or lower Zombie monster from your opponent's GY that was destroyed by battle. <strong>***Necroworld Banshee</strong>(Outside Support): Can both protect Zombie World as well as activating more copies from the hand or Deck. <strong>***Zombie Master</strong>: By discarding a monster it can revive a Level 4 or lower Zombie monster from any GY. <strong>***Mezuki</strong>(Outside Support): Can mill a Zombie OPT and it can Special Summon a Zombie monster from the hand if it is sent to the GY. <strong>***Pyramid Turtle</strong>: Really good floater. Can float even into REZD. <strong>*Spirit Reaper</strong>: Emergency battle staller. <strong>**Plaguespreader Zombie</strong>: Main Tuner of the Deck, can revive itself by returing a card to the top of the Deck. <strong>**Book of Life</strong>: Revival card for Zombie monsters but requires setup. <strong>*Pot of Avarice</strong>: Recycling and draw power. <strong>**Dragon's Mirror</strong>(Outside Support): Used to summon Nethersoul. <strong>*Card Destruction</strong>(Outside Support): Hand refresher, giving that some monsters can work well on the GY and can let you use Book of Life turn 1. <strong>*Terraforming</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs Zombie World. <strong>***Call of the Mummy</strong>: Zombie-themed Valhalla. <strong>***Zombie World</strong>: Turns all monsters on the field and GYs to Zombies and neither player can Tribute Summon except Zombie monsters. Main enabler for most of your playmakers. <strong>***Waboku</strong>: Battle protection. <strong>***Bottomless Trap Hole</strong>: Disruption for your opponents' summons. Extra Deck: <strong>**Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>: Cannot destroy monsters by battle but it reduces its ATK to 0 and spawns a Token with ATK and Level equal to that monster's. Accesible with Dragon's Mirror due to being and original Dragon-type. <strong>*Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree</strong>: Generic Level 10 Synchro with targeting protection. <strong>*Giganticastle</strong>: Generic Level 9 Synchro that can be a large beater. <strong>*Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong>: Enough explaining why, is just Trish. <strong>*Iron Chain Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro. Good beater with milling effect. <strong>*Red Wyvern</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro with potential Quick monster removal. <strong>*HTS Psyhemuth</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro that can banish any monster it battles alongside himself. <strong>**Doomkaiser Dragon</strong>: Steals any Zombie monster from your opponent's GY when Special Summoned by any means. More specific to summon. <strong>*Celestial Wolf Lord, Blue Sirius</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro and debuffer. <strong>*Coral Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro Tuner with targeted destruction and draw power. <strong>*Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro with good bouncing effect. <strong>*Armades, Keeper of Boundaries</strong>: Generic Level 5 Synchro and solid beater. <strong>*Ally of Justice Catastor</strong>: Generic Level 5 Synchro that can destroy any non-DARK monster."

In the Zombie Madness decklist I left the 2 new rules that will be used from now on in the series, but to summarize:  - The Deck's plyastyle must play around thier boss monster, and said boss monster must be featured at 3 at all times. However, this is one of the Structure Decks where a special case happens that more than 1 monster is featured in its cover. In that case, there has to be a combination of 3 cards along said monsters. - The Extra Deck must be built depending on the time the Structure Deck was printed and if it has any Extra Deck monsters or has access to them.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> One thing some people don't know is that this Deck forms part of an new OCG series of prebuilt decks known there as the R Series (which I'm gonna assume stands for Revisited given the nature this Decks tend to have). This series focuses on one thing: take an old Structure Deck, retrain their main Boss Monster with a better array of effects, add a few new playmakers that fill the theme of both the Deck and the current meta and it's ready to go. In this case, alongside creating a new version of Zombie World's boss monster, they also added another one and splashed some new cards that not only interact with Zombie monsters but also when Zombie World is live.  On a kind of rare situation, this Deck features 2 boss monsters. First we have <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong>, which is a retrain version of <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>. Is a Level 7 DARK Zombie Synchro monster and requires a Tuner and 1 or more non-Tuners. It gains 100 ATK/DEF for each Zombie monster on the field and both GYs. Also, when another Zombie monster is destroyed by battle, it can Special Summon one Zombie monster from any GY to your field. Even if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on the field or not, Necro Dragon can turn into a good beater that its revival effect acts more like recovery for your destroyed monsters. But if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on, its stats can go way higher, can steal some good playmakers from the opponent's GY and can use them for any Extra Deck play needed.  The other Boss Monster is <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong>, a Level 8 DARK Zombie with 2800 ATK/2000 DEF. During the Standby Phase, if this card is on the GY while a Field Spell is on the field face-up: you can Special Summon it on face-up Defense Position. Also, once per Chain you can activate 1 of these effects on response to the effect activation of a Zombie monster: -Negate that effect. -Banish 1 monster on the field or either GY. All of this effects are hard OPT, but their usefulness more than compensates for it. It returns every turn, making it a reliable material for Xyz and Link plays as well as being hard to get rid off, and his effects can be triggered by your own monsters or the opponents', so you can apply the banish effect each turn and apply the negates against your opponent.  Since the new rule says that a combination of 3 cards must be used among these cards, I went with 2 Doomkings and 1 Necro Dragon, giving that this deck can have a quite generous Extra Deck toolbox. As for their playstyle, they take the focus on GY and monster stealing that Zombie World started and reinforced it, as well as giving them new tools to access their higher Level monsters and Extra Deck faster.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>*Eldlich the Golden Lord</strong>: Easy to summon body with high stats and good effects, even if this Deck runs more monsters than backrow. <strong>*Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</strong>: Another easy to summon monster than can tribute 1 Zombie monster to revive another one with a different name. <strong>**Doomking Balerdroch</strong>: One of the two Boss Monster of the Deck, granting disruption and being hard to get rid off. <strong>*Jack-o-Bolan</strong>: Easy summoning condition. Can revive a Zombie monster from any GY at the cost of banishing himself for the rest of the turn. <strong>***Necroworld Banshee</strong>: Main searcher and protector of Zombie World. <strong>***Gozuki</strong>: Zombie miller. It can Special Summon a Zombie from the hand if he is sent to the GY. <strong>***Mezuki</strong>: Can banish itself from the GY to revive a Zombie monster. Very useful for play extension. <strong>***Shiranui Solitaire</strong>: Can tribute any Zombie monster to Special Summon a Zombie from the Deck with 0 DEF. Gives access to 2 of your main Tuners. <strong>***Uni-Zombie</strong>: One of your main Tuners. Can dump a Zombie from the hand or Deck to change the Level of a monster. Accesible by Solitaire's effect. <strong>***Glow-Up Bloom</strong>: Your other main Tuner, but you will mostly use it for its GY effect. Can cheat out or search high Level Zombie monsters from the Deck, depending if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on the field. <strong>**Book of Life</strong>: Good revival card for Zombie decks, but requires setup. <strong>*Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>: Backrow removal. <strong>***Monster Gate</strong>: Really useful if paired with Bloom, Mezuki or Gozuki. <strong>*Upstart Goblin</strong>: Giving that there are more non-DARK monsters on the Main Deck, using Allure of Darkness can be risky. <strong>*Card Destruction</strong>: Hand refresher. <strong>*Foolish Burial</strong>: Simple mill effect, giving that any monster can benefit from it. <strong>*Monster Reborn</strong>: Simple revival effect. <strong>***Zombie World</strong>: Your Homeland. Lets most of your bigger monsters to interact with your opponent's field and GY. <strong>*Metaverse</strong>: Can search or activate <strong>Zombie World</strong> directly from the Deck. <strong>***Rivalry of the Warlords</strong>: If paired with <strong>Zombie World</strong>, it can heavily slow your opponents plays. Prone to removal though.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> <strong>*Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 8 Synchro that can potentially add 1 LIGHT or DARK monster from your Deck to the hand while also milling 4 cards. Even if you fail the search, whatever monsters you mill are still useful. <strong>*Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 8 Synchro with negation. <strong>*Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</strong>: Generic Level 8 Synchro for monster hate. <strong>*Psy-Framelord Omega</strong>: Generic Level 8 Synchro for hand ripping and for recycling banished monsters. <strong>*Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 7 Synchro and second Boss Monster of the Deck. Can reach high stats and can revive any Zombie when another one is destroyed by battle. <strong>*The Undead Vampire</strong>: Generic Rank 8 Xyz Monster that can also use 2 monsters that were originally from your opponent for its summon. Can mill 4 cards from each Deck and revive one monster milled by its effect. <strong>*Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong>: Generic Rank 8 Xyz monster with Spell negation and can redirect attacks. <strong>*Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong>: Generic Level 8 Xyz monster with non targeting removal and mass destruction protection. <strong>*Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong>: Link 4 for Zombies that can negate the effects of face-up monsters and reduce their ATK to 0 in response to a revival, twice per turn. <strong>*Accesscode Talker</strong>: Link 4 monster and potential game ender. Can reach high attack values and has Spell Speed 4 removal. <strong>*Vampire Fascinator</strong>: Link 3 for Zombie monsters. Steals a monster from the opponents' GY on Link Summon and can tribute a ""Vampire"" monster, including herself, to steal a monster your opponent controls. Gives easy access to Absolute Zero and The Undead Vampire. <strong>*Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi</strong>: Link 3 for Zombie monsters. Negates the effects of a monster on Special Summon and can banish itself from the GY to Special Summon 1 Zombie Synchro Monster from the GY or that is banished. <strong>*Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</strong>: Link 3 for Zombie monsters. Cannot be destroyed by battle and prevents Synchro monsters from being destroyed by card effects. Can bring a banished Zombie Synchro monster to a zone it points to. <strong>*Vampire Sucker</strong>: Link 2 for Zombie monsters. Lets you Tribute Summon Zombie monsters using your opponent's Zombie monsters. Can revive a monster from the opponent's GY to their field and draws 1 if a Zombie monster is Special Summoned from the GY. Very useful with Doomking. <strong>*Avendread Savior</strong>: Link 2 for Zombie monsters. During damage calculation, it can mill 1 Zombie monster to reduce the ATK of the monster is battling with. Very useful to get the higher Level Zombies, like Doomking, on the GY.  And this should be it for this very delayed Halloween special.

It's the only archetype from GX that I remotely enjoy, and honestly, that may be because it only uses fusions lol. Anyway, this deck should be good for use, however, the only thing I see bad with it is bricking with all spells/traps. But let's focus on the strat.  <em><span><strong>DECK STRATEGY</strong></span></em>  The first thing you want to look for is your deck to hand cards, like <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Ancient Gear Frame, and </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern. Then, no matter first thing you get is </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion to get out one of ya boys from the extra deck. I would personally get out </a><a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant since it's the only one with 3 copies in the extra deck, and it's the deck master.</a>  The next thing you have to do is hold out for more fusions cards, whether you add them to your hand or draw them. GET OUT <a data-name=""ANCIENT GEAR MEGATRON GOLEM"">ANCIENT GEAR MEGATRON GOLEM, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. It allows you to get out </a><a data-name=""Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem"">Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem without using a fusion card like </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a><a data-name=""Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem""> or </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Ancient Gear Hunting Hound.</a>  Finally, just absolutely f**kin beat down your opponent. Try your best to get out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound"">Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound, since it can help OTK. You don't have to, but it'll help secure the win.</a>  <em><span><strong>OTHER STRATEGIES</strong></span></em>  <em><strong>Reactor Dragon Assembly Summon/Reactor Dragon Backrow Protection</strong></em>  To do this, the thing you want to do is keep searching the Ancient Gear cards that have destruction effects. For example, <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown lets you special summon 1 Ancient Gear monster from your hand, deck, or graveyard when destroyed. Look for cards like that, and get them on the field. And then, you NEED to get out </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon, so you can destroy those cards to get more summons in during the battle phase. USE </a><a data-name=""ANCIENT GEAR GADGET"">ANCIENT GEAR GADGET FOR ITS SUMMON!!! This allows it to attack twice, so you need it to maximize spell destruction and then summons.</a>"

Any feedback I would be immensely grateful, I didn't watch Zexal's anime, but I fell in love with this archetype.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Atualization 1</p> <p dir=""ltr""><span><span>portanto, deve ser ignorado quando pelo Galaxy Expedition e Galaxy Trance, a melhor combinação com ele, até onde testei, é usar o efeito Galaxy Soldier, descartando um Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon adicionado ao Galaxy Knight do deck, convoque-o para seu efeito e convoque o ""Dragão de Fótons de Olhos de Galáxia"" do cemitério. </span><span>Tirando essa carta, não há muito mais a acrescentar, Accellight ainda é uma boa carta, mas com uma limitação um tanto chata, lembro-me de uma ou duas vezes que tive Galaxy Knight em minha mão pronto para puxar um Photon Dragon do cemitério. </span><span>, mas eu não pude por causa do efeito Accellight, Return Of Dragon Lords provou ser uma ótima carta, pois além de convocar os dois dragões do deck principal (Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon e Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon) do cemitério,</span></span></p> <p dir=""ltr""></p>"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Rocket"", known in the OCG as either ""Vullet"" or ""Varrett""[1] (ヴァレット Varetto), is an archetype of DARK Dragon monsters used by Roken Kogami/Varis in the Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS anime. All ""Rokket"" monsters are legless, mechanical Dragons, with heads shaped like various types of ammunition, and green hard-light wings (except ""Silverrokket Dragon"" and ""Rokket Caliber"", whose wings are magenta).  Sorry for the deck list, I put ""Magnarokket Dragon"" from side deck to main deck and put ""Dinowrestler Pankratops"" to side deck. So, the total of the main deck is 44 card decks.  Strategy for this deck : 1. Make sure when you use the ""Dragunity Remus"" Special Summon effect from the graveyard you already summoned ""Crystron Halqifibrax"" first.  2. You can use the dragunity engine first according to the fifth combo in this video to counter Nibiru from opponent hand.  3. ""Dragunity Remus"" can be replaced if you have an extender in hand. So, when you've used the effect to summon ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"" you can still run combos as usual.  4. For the fourth combo you must pay close attention to what you have in your hand and keep in mind that ""Dragonity Remus"" can be replaced if you have an extender in hand, so you don't need to use 2 copies of ""Dagon Ravine"".

Eldlich: well, Eldlich can help the deck OTK and can special summon zombie monsters from the deck, GY and hand. Basically a good support for the Mayakashi.  Small world: this gives the deck a leap in consistency! If you banish Uni-zombie from your deck you can seach for Yuki-Musume, Hajun and Eldlich the Golden Lord.  &nbsp;  In the end Mayakashi have some nice mechanics but dont have enough extenders to make a good pure deck and the floating effects can be easily evicted by non-destruction effects.  !UPDATE:Added Zombie Reborn and Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

Special summon LinkSlayer and normal summon Alisteir the invoker (search him with meltdown) and summon salamangreat almiraj, after summon Predaplant verte and use eff to summon dark dragoon. If you have Parallel exceed you can do the same thing but you can special summon it from hand when u summon Almiraj.  If you special summon LinkSlayer but u use Onomatopaira combo and  the opponent use veiller or impremanence etc.. on gagaga sister , then u can special summon zubaba bancho from hand and summon predaplant verte and use his eff to summon Dark dragoon.  If you have Parallel exceed in hand , you can summon salamangreat almiraj using Gagaga sister and then special summon parallel exceed and then summon predaplant verte, use eff and summon dark dragoon.  TIP (only for onomatopaira combo): you have 2 predaplant verte in case the opponent use negate on the first one, so if you use onomatopaira combo and u summon the first predaplant verte ,make sure you use the first eff to make a monster dark antribute ,in this way u will provoke the opponent to use negate, and then summon the second predaplant verte and use his eff to summon dark dragoon.  Dogmatika combo and Invoker combo is same, i am lazy to write them, i will just mention this deck is not using Punishment in the dogmatika engine because here is 11 perfect starter cards (meltdown, alisteir, onomatopickup and onomatopaira) so believe me that u don't want to lock your extra deck!  In this deck is not terraforming and not 3 copies of alisteir and not 2 copies of invocation  because u already have 11 perfect starter cards in total...  The 2 Kaiju in the deck is usually to get rid of boss monster and is very helpful ,2 droplet is perfectly fine (u don't want more, sometimes u cant afford the cost)  Some TIPS:  if u are going first, Zeus in the extra deck is usually summoned using Traptrix rafflesia  If u want to use Zeus when u are going second , onomatopaira combo: when u summon beatrice and use the eff to send in gy utopic onomat. attack 1 monster and then summon zeus, use eff of zeus and the field is clear:D , after that use gagagarevenge to special summon bancho and summon predaplant verte and use eff to summon dark dragoon , or if u want to keep zeus on the field , use eff of bancho to sp. summon utopic onomat. from gy and summon traptrix rafflesia .  so is your choice if u want only dragoon or zeus(no materials) + traptrix rafflesia.  &nbsp;  In the side deck is sacred tree beast, u can summon it by gagaga magician and gagagawind. how:  onomatopaira combo: take gagaga sister + gagaga magician, summon gagaga sister and use eff to take gagagawind. use gagagwind and summon gagaga magician, use eff to make him level 7, use eff of sister to make them level 9 and summon sacred tree beast.  i am lazy to write more combos, the deck is good. enjoy  &nbsp;  CREATED SPECIALLY BY ME: DENIS.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

For those who don't know, the deck consists of spellcasters of various levels and attributes that activate their effects by discarding spell cards from your hand, this makes them seem resource intensive but all the archetype spells can add themselves back to the hand during your end phase. With the inclusion of the new fusion, the deck became much stronger even though the fusion spell is sort of mediocre. I found the deck suitable as a control deck that uses the extra deck as a toolbox, hence I chose not to run neither extravagance nor prosperity in the main deck as of the current moment.   </span>  <span><b>Deck starters going first</b><strong>:</strong></span>  <span><strong> Witchcrafters</strong> <strong>(level4 &amp; under):</strong> they tribute themselves and discard any spell to special summon another Witchcrafter of any level from deck; due to this they are very fragile to handtraps and negation, hence playing gamma and driver is necessary in this deck, and going into <a data-name=""Chaos ruler"">Chaos ruler</a> can help fill your GY with cards.</span>  <span><strong>- Witchcrafter Unveiling : </strong>Special summon any Witchcrafter monster in hand and can give your monsters immunity when activating their effects, the Witchcraft monsters already dodge <em><strong><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></strong></em> and <strong><em><a data-name=""Skill drain"">Skill drain</a></em></strong> well, they have a problem with handtraps, this can help play around them. </span>  <span><strong>-Reasoning: </strong>Automatic inclusion in the deck as they are diverse in levels and the smaller Witchcrafters have effects in the GY, you also don't mind having the in-theme spells and monsters in GY, as you can banish a spell along with <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter &lt;a data-name=&quot;Genni&quot;&gt;Genni&lt;/a&gt;"">Witchcrafter </a><a data-name=""Genni"">Genni</a> </strong></em>to extend play; recovery of card with <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Potterie"">Witchcrafter Potterie</a> </strong></em>with an empty hand; <em><strong><a data-name=""Magician's Restage"">Magician's Restage</a></strong></em> can activate adding the floodgate hands; worst case scenario the spells add themselves to hand at the End-phase when you at least placed a boss card on the field.</span>  <span><strong>-Gamma and Driver : </strong>mentioned a couple of times already, together they can help you go into chaos ruler and fill your GY, and they can also go into a link 2 like <a data-name=""Lyna the light charmer"">Lyna the light charmer </a>or <a data-name=""lambda"">lambda</a> and build up into a <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the master magicians"">Selene, Queen of the master magicians</a> for an OTK.</span>  <span><b>-Magicians' Soul : </b>Sends <strong><em>Witchcrafter</em> <em>Hanie</em></strong> or <strong><em>Madame Verre</em></strong> from deck to GY as cost, but also a free special summon with <a data-name=""Anima"">Anima</a> and <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> as a tech option, being a (Dark) [Spellcaster] makes it a wonderful inclusion in the deck with the <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Confusion"">Witchcrafter Confusion</a> spell</strong> </em>and a <em><strong><a data-name=""Super polymerization"">Super polymerization</a></strong></em> target. It can also be re-summoned by restage, and last but not least it helps you draw cards by discarding and/or sending spells from field or hands. All around good card that could be a staple in the main deck.</span>  <span><b>Deck starters going Second</b><strong>:</strong></span>  <span><strong>-Super Polymerization: </strong>it is an absolute beast of a card this meta, with a diverse set of targets that can hit most of the meta decks, best thing is there is little your opponent can do against you, they can't even play <em><strong><a data-name=""secret village of spellcasters"">secret village of spellcasters</a></strong></em> against you, this is especially useful because people are not ending on large boards with many negates this format, so super poly can hit <strong>invoked-Dogmatika</strong><em>(<a data-name=""Shaddoll Winda"">Shaddoll Winda</a> - <a data-name=""Mudragon"">Mudragon</a> - <a data-name=""Witchcrafter vice-master"">Witchcrafter vice-master</a>)</em> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Eldlich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(the mad golden lord&lt;/em&gt;""><strong>Eldlich</strong><em>(the mad golden lord</em></a><em>) </em><strong>Prank-kids </strong><em>(<a data-name=""Rocket ride"">Rocket ride</a>) </em><strong>Tribrigade/birds</strong><em>(<a data-name=""Guardragon Almarduk"">Guardragon Almarduk</a>) </em><strong>Common Dark types can be beat with starving venom/<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoveretum"">Predaplant Triphyoveretum</a>/<a data-name=""Predaplant Dracostapelia"">Predaplant Dracostapelia</a>(live-twins,DPE, etc........ </strong><em><strong>Swordsoul</strong> is probably the most difficult deck to out.</em></span>  <span><strong>-<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>: </strong>Thousand-eyes/Millennium-eyes into Restrict Anima, but that is probably a long stretch, both targets can be summoned w/ <strong>Magician's Restage</strong></span>  <hr />  <span><strong>Extra-deck explained:</strong></span>  <span>[5-6]cards of the deck is a fusion toolbox consisting of <strong>2 Witchcrafter Vice-master</strong>, Super-poly targets and/or instant fusion targets. Since the inclusion of the a Witchcrafter fusion monster, I've found success and synergy in using instant fusion, super polymerization. This can be reduced to 3 slots if you side/remove super-poly </span>  <span>[1 slot for a level 8 synchro], I've found most success with <strong>Chaos ruler </strong>since it can set up the graveyard for you and it can revive itself once very easily to go into access-code talker finisher, but the options are limitless depending on what you feel you need for the deck</span>  <span>[1 slot for a Rank8] <strong>Witchcrafter</strong> <b>Aruru, Madame Verre, and Vice-master are all level 8</b>: some viable options can include <strong>Dingirsu/Sanaphond the Skyprison/Number 38: Hope Harbinger/ Lancelot, </strong>the option to run a Rank8 is optional and running more than 1 is unnecessary since it rarely comes up</span>  <span>[Rest of the ExtraDeck is Links]</span>  <span><strong>Charmers</strong> compliment the deck very well, not only because they are cute girls as well, but because you run a diverse attribute of spellcasters. The most viable ones are probably Hiita, Aussa, and Lyna: most because they can summon handtraps from your opponents deck Ash Blossom/Ghost belle/Effect Veiler respectively, this sets up a guaranteed Link 3 into Selene.</span>  <span><strong>Selene + AccessCode</strong> Talker are an expensive duo to run, but it is a game closer, Access code's 5300 atk + Vice-master's 2700 atk = a clean 8000 damage, together you are guaranteed  from minimum 3 to 4 pops on the field at least, this will win you games on its own not much to say</span>  <span><strong>Artemis/Anima/Linkuriboh </strong>can place your Witchcrafters in deck, all 3 are good in certain situations but above all Artemis has the most versatility since it can be made by any of the small Witchcrafters and is a spellcaster, anima is also a spellcaster and it can catch your opponent offguard, but is a side option since they are less likely to fall for the same trick twice. Linkuriboh can be useful to blink Genni, souls and the restricts but sadly it isn't a spellcaster, so I don't blame you if you don't run it, but on field it can save you from an attack.</span>  <span><strong>Verte Anaconda/Psyframelord Lambda </strong>verte has 3 targets in deck superpoly/instant fusion/Witchcrafter confusion and if you are really bold magicalized fusion is a tech option, but try to banish souls/restrict/anima/any charmer instead of 2 Witchcrafters, since you can make use of the Witchcrafters effect or revive them with holiday. Psyframelord is a generic Link-2 that is light that can turn a dead gamma in your hand live in worst case scenario. </span>  <span>The healthy amount of Dark and light in the extradeck makes reborning Chaos Lord very easy, but it is banished when it leaves the field...unless you make a rank 8 and  detach it then you can do it again.</span>"

The point of the deck is to stall while dealing effect damage, direct attacks, and generally frustrating your opponents. When I first made the deck, it won pretty frequently both online and in real life (still does).  You can experiment with your own traps since I just threw in what I had, and they work well.  The extra deck can also be expanded on, I just never really felt the need.  There are no boss monsters to this deck"

The goal of this deck is to get out the Blue-Eyes Chaos dragon, most people will say it is the boss monster of this deck. The best way to get this monster out is by using the effect of the Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon. I use the White Stone of Ancients to special summon it during the end phase which adds chaos form to my hand, then since it is the end phase I also add the Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon to my hand. Next turn use a Blue-Eyes White Dragon to tribute with chaos form (alternative's name becomes blue eyes white dragon so that's a good choice). Once it is one the field it is usually game over, this deck has a dozen ways protect it so no need to worry. If you build this good luck."

In the side deck, there is a way to get into Dark Simorgh against back row decks. You can put ani-spell to synergize with the Dark Simorgh if you would like, but I found it not necessary. The overall goal is to get to Goliath or Sloth.  <strong>Pros: </strong>The deck actually has a surprisingly good win rate! The field spell can allow for your Saizo to become similar to a towers as long as you have a monster onboard and a ninja in the grave witch can be very useful. I've won games because my opponent cannot out Saizo and then I just drop a Goliath and win. This deck is NOT an aggressive deck and you win by staying up in resources. I find the deck very fun, and it does amazing in the grind game.  <strong>Cons: </strong>It is very meta-dependent. It is good against certain decks in our format, but that changes depending on the match-up. It does not have a great match-up against drytron and against flundereeze, the idea is to stop extra deck decks from going into the extra deck, but any level one decks also are not great because you have to improvise to get into Goliath/Sloth (I once pen summoned tribute fodder for my sloth using two monsters in my deck that just happened to be scales). Lastly, it struggles with monster removal.  <strong>Conclusion: </strong>The deck actually puts up a decent fight against most decks but is very meta-dependent. I hope you have fun with the deck!

The most important thing is having Mystic Wok in your hand. Second is having Ascended Sage or Zexal Construction or Hyper-Rank-Up.  Here the 3 cards combo (Mystic Wok, Ascended Sage, Armed Sage): <ol>  	<li>Special summon Ascended Sage</li>  	<li>Special summon Armed Sage</li>  	<li>Xyz summon Number 39 and use Ascended Sage to add Hyper-Rank-Up, Armed Sage to add Tornado Bringer</li>  	<li>Xyz summon Number S39</li>  	<li>Use Hyper-Rank-Up to summon Number 99</li>  	<li>Use Number 99's effect to summon Number 97 and attach Hyper-Rank-Up to it</li>  	<li>Use Number 97's effect to summon Number 100 by using Number 38 as material</li>  	<li>Use Number 100's effect</li>  	<li>Set Mystic Wok then end your turn</li>  	<li>At your opponent's Draw Phase, use Number 99's effect to summon Number 43, then attach Hyper-Rank-Up to it</li>  	<li>Use Mystic Wok, tribute Number 100</li>  	<li>Use Number 43's effect to take all of your opponent hope and give them despair</li> </ol> If you don't have Mystic Wok in hand, you can still end up with a really strong board.  Here's how:  1 to 5 you just do the same to bring out Number 99  6. Summon Leo Utopia Ray, attach Hyper to it  7. Use Leo's effect to equip it with Pegasus  8. Equip it with Tornado in your hand (was added by Armed Sage's effect)  9. End your phase  10. During your opponent's Draw phase, use Number 99's effect to summon Number 38 and attach Hyper to it  If you do it successfully, you will have 2 monster effect negates, 1 spell negate. Also if your opponent attack, you can change it ATK to 0 by using Number 99's effect  &nbsp;"

The only interesting things should be the ratio of traps I'm using and the side deck.  I run 3 Chuche because you really want to see it through opening it or through Kauwloon, the second one being the more preferable option if you're able to make it live on your first turn.  Normally if someone runs Xuanwu they like cutting Chuche down to 2, but personally I'd prefer the extra trap over not seeing Chuche as much.  My build likes going first, but it has tools for going second as well. I feel like I don't need to explain many of the extra or side deck choices, though those are where most VW decks differ. So feel free to change those around. Dragoon can be swapped out for Invoked Caliga, or not ran at all. If you chose not to run either Dragoon or Caliga, make sure you remove Muddy Mudragon as well."

After that you can pop one of your backrow to summon your eldlich, if you open with eldland the advantage becomes really disgusting.  In the opponent's turn mirrorjade can send another albion to get another branded fusion/opening/albaz to get some fusion plays going, otherwise it can send titanklad wich will get you ecclesia wich will get you punishment.  You can totally mess around with ratios and wich traps to run but I think that the idea behind the deck of mirrojade+eldlich and some set cards is really strong.  You could probably play lord of the heavenly prison, but you'd probably need to make more space for it since eldlich on its own has kind of an hard time triggering it (because the traps lock you into zombies).  Also you could play more ways to get into branded fusion (another alubert, kitt etc), but while branded fusion is a strong play I'd rather play more traps since they are really good this format, and in general is better to open a lot of traps and way to get to branded fusion than just a lot of cards that get you branded fusion.  You could also play the destroy phoenix enforcer engine and it works well with mirrorjade, probably if you cut like the second albaz, 1 huaquero, golden land forever and the lost winds you could totally play like that."

The fiend engine adds <a data-name=""Tindangle Jherlth"">Tindangle Jherlth</a>, which can discard another card and send a Tindangle, which will be <a data-name=""Tindangle Intruder"">Tindangle Intruder,</a> from your deck to special summon itself, then if Intruder was sent to the graveyard it will summon itself. On flip Jhrelth can add or send any flip monster and Intruder can search <a data-name=""Tindangle Angel"">Tindangle Angel.</a>  The Subterror engine can get to <a data-name=""Subterror Guru"">Subterror Guru which can add </a><a data-name=""Subterror Fiendess"">Subterror Fiendess</a><a data-name=""Subterror Guru""> for a negate,</a> Subterror Volteluric can allow you to make <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a>, or Subterror Succession which gives us access to our other engines.  The Shaddoll engine gives us access to the powerful Fusion monsters but the main deck Shaddoll monsters are especially powerful in this deck as disruption and incredibly sticky monsters. The Dogmatika package allows us to access the Shaddoll engine through <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone's graveyard effect.</a>  Floodgates like <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Only Be One"">There Can Only Be One</a><a data-name=""There Can Only Be One""> and board breakers like </a><a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a><a data-name=""There Can Only Be One""> and </a><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being""> are especially good in this deck because it uses a lot of set monsters which are unaffected by these floodgates, and these floodgates also slow the game enough that one or two disruptive flip effects a turn cycle can turn the game in your favour.</a>"

Always summon Harr first, then typically Utgarda. Try to keep Harr on board as he's your most powerful boss. Typically you'll make Jormungandr as your first extra deck monster, the rest are toolbox.  The deck grinds very well with an abundance of interactions and negates as well as Hela's ability to revive a generaider every single turn. Your opening turn is typically very linear, but beyond that the deck has many routes you can advance through based on the game state, so make sure you understand how to manage your resources properly.  Starlight Road and Summon Limit can single handedly win you games in best of 3's, so keep those in your side deck. Feel free to switch the handtraps around for whatever you prefer or is meta at the moment.  You can cut N'tss, Link Spider, and Dyson Sphere from the extra deck based on preference as well."

Not competitive, but did get me the Platinum in Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist so there's that!","This is the deck I built that got me a Platinum trophy on Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist.  It's not competitive in a real-life environment but does the job very well in that game.  I've been a big fan of Spirits ever since Noah's Ark *chirping crickets* in the anime, so hopefully this deck shows off some of the cool stuff they can do!  The main strategy of the deck is to disrupt and hit hard.  Having the ritual monsters break boards via their effects and then using them to special summon out Amano-Iwato (so it isn't bounced back to the hand by it's own effect) to prevent your opponent activating monster effects is the main strategy.  I also like having Great Long Nose as it can really limit your opponents options from breaking your board and getting going again.  I wanted to keep the deck as purely Spirit themed as possible, hence no extra deck, but Pre-Preparation of Rites is far too useful for getting this deck going to leave out and after playing through the game having a deck without Twin Twisters or Mystical Space Typhoon in it just felt wrong to me &#x1f602;!"

Anyway, here is my Heroic Challenger deck, named after pretty much the MVP of ancient Sparta and the movie <em>300</em>, Leonidas I.  &nbsp;  Heroic is intended to be an offensive, go-second deck, and the support they got is supposed to remind you. Their new Rank 4, Cliaomh Solias, can bring your Life Points down to 500 in exchange for doubling the ATK of a monster on your field once the Battle Phase starts. If combo'd with one of their Spell cards, Heroic Chance, that monster's ATK can be doubled again which can easily lead to an OTK. To help facilitate said OTK, this deck runs a total of 8 hand traps and 3 backrow removal.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You want to have about 8-10 cards in hand at the start of you main phase 2. Including atleast 2 Ojamassimilation and 1 Ojamagic. You can easily make A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon with the Ojamassimilation but keep in mind that using the materials for ABC-Dragon Buster and 1 other monster on field to summon Saryuja and still summon ABC while using the materials from the GY. You can also use the effect of ABC once before summoning XYZ to create A-to-Z. You only need 1 Ojama Blue to pull this combo off meaning that you only need 1 of your Ojama Blue, Summoner Monk, Rescue Cat or Ojamatch. 11 Cards in your deck start your combo. If you dont draw them try to use your Ojamas to get a level 2 xyz to summon AA-Zeus or Melffy Mommy and hope for the best."

This one is a lot better and is likely to be the best this deck will get, or at least close. I'll update the explanations to include/remove stuff I changed, but otherwise it'll remain mostly the same with strategy explanation. Also I am including Epsilon who, at this time, is only in the OCG. He will be in the TCG with the upcoming pack in February, so for now replace him with Delta.  <span>Card Explanations:</span>  <span>Main Deck:</span>  Pretty simple strategy with Magnet Warriors. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are all easy to get out using each other, just read their effects and you should understand easily. Epsilon is good for getting them into the GY, which is not something Magnets mind very much as there are multiple ways to get them out of there, and Berserkion can be summoned using Magnets in the GY. The Adamancipator cards are good for getting Magnets out easily as well. Magnet Induction is another good searcher for Magnets, as well as Adamancipator Friends. Monster Reborn is a general good card for Magnets since it offers a way to special summon them for their search effects. Magnetic Field is very good as it allows you to special summon a Magnet from the GY, and it also offers very good battle protection as any monster destroying one of your Magnets (or Adamancipators) by battle will return that attacking monster to the hand. While this is a good effect and is great to have, it is not essential, so I opted not to add something like Terraforming. Ash Blossom is just a general good negate, which are needed as Magnets are not the best archetype in the world in all honesty. Berserkion is a good boss monster on his own, and has a non-once per turn destruction by banishing a Magnet from the GY, as well as summoning the 3 Magnets after being destroyed. Valkyrion is only there for the summon of Imperion, as well as Poly. Deskbot is for a specific combo I'll go over later. Gamaciel is a great form of removal that's very important because this deck struggles a lot with stuff like Dragoon. Adamancipator Signs lets you summon a Magnet or Adamancipator from the GY, basically another Monster Reborn, and if you use it on an Adamancipator you can put a Magnet on the top of the deck for the Adamancipator effect. Adamancipator Friends is good for if your opponent negated everything else you have and you need something in your hand at least. I wouldnt use it until you're out of options since it locks you out of summoning except for rock monsters and most of the extra deck isn't rock.  As for the side deck, I kinda just threw in stuff I thought would be good for general negation. You can put whatever you want I didn't put much time into it.  <span>Extra Deck:</span>  Imperion is the main boss monster of the deck. 4000 attack beatstick plus an almost-omni-negate, and he can summon Berserkion and Valkyrion from the deck upon leaving the field via card effect, similar to Berserkion (which is why I run two copies of both). Baronne is a secondary boss, pretty easy to get out in this deck in a strategy I'll go over later. Borreload Savage Dragon is another good negate, and isn't used nearly as often as Baronne but is still useful in certain situations. Zeus is mainly used if you want a board wipe, which is mainly brought out by attacking with Gorgonic, who also negates. Gorgonic is very easy to get out as it can be brought out with two Magnets, and offers good negation (But be careful, because if you want Berserkion on the field you can't use the Magnets as Xyz material for this or else you can't summon Berserkion). Underworld Goddess is good to get one of their monsters out and negate the others. Acesscode Talker, Knightmare Phoenix, and I:P Masquerena are all general support cards, you should be able to figure out how to use them. Auroradon and Halqifibrax are also for the Baronne summon covered in a bit, and the secon Halqifibrax is for after you use the other one and is good for getting out Adamancipators. Cherubini is useful for getting another Magnet in the GY, as well as offering destruction protection. Verte is the main way to get out Imperion.  &nbsp;  <span>General Strategies and Downsides:</span>  This deck's capability is very dependent on your starting hand, as it contains a lot of monsters, so don't expect this deck to be 100% consistent as sometimes you can just get a horrible hand. That being said, most of the time you can take pretty good advantage of your starting hand to at least get something on the board. After playing this deck a lot, you should get the hang of what order to do certain things, but be weary that this deck is very easy to brick with. One negate on a not-amazing starting hand could lead to you ending the turn with just a useless Magnet normal summoned and that's it. The deck is pretty good at searching though, so playing it at 45 cards is actually better for consistency, and since making that change I've actually bricked less with it.  General way to get out Imperion is to swarm the field with Magnets and at least get two out for Verte. You usually need at least one of the level 8 Magnets in your starting hand so you can search out the other with Alpha and fuse them turn 1. Baronne has a somewhat-fast combo to get it out, which is basically the longest combo in the deck which isn't saying much. You need at least one Adamancipator and any other card, then summon Halqifibrax. Use his effect to summon Deskbot, then link them both into Auroradon. Use his effect to summon 3 tokens, which activates Deskbot's GY effect to summon himself. Deskbot is level 1, the tokens are all level 3, and Baronne is level 10. 1+3+3+3=10, so easy summon for Baronne with just two monsters. This combo also gets Halqifibrax in the GY, potentially to be used for Borreload. Borreload can be summoned with the level 4 Adamancipator and Epsilon, so you won't be getting him out nearly as much as Baronne, but sometimes you'll be in this situation where they're the only two cards on field and this'll be a good option. As mentioned before, you'll want to get Zeus out with Gorgonic generally, as his board wipe can be very useful for some problem cards. The other cards I basically went over already, and they're easy to understand how to use anyways.  This deck has a really big problem against Dragoon, which I guess so do a lot of decks. The only way I can really deal with it (besides just negating Verte) is to Kaiju it, which is why I play 3 of him in the deck. I wouldn't suggest Super Poly, as that makes summoning Imperion almost impossible because you can't use material from the hand. This deck doesn't summon Valkyrion because he's useless as a monster and the normal monsters are obviously bad (them being the intended way to get him out). Of course if you want to change the deck to remove Imperion altogether, go ahead, but I like using Imperion because he's in the archetype and actually not too bad of a monster. I might not have a choice if Verte gets banned though, since then I won't really know how to consistently get Imperion out.  <span>Afterword:</span>  So yeah, that's a basic summary of this deck. My friend helped me make this deck and I thank him a lot for this, as this is absolutely my favourite deck to use and Magnets are my favourite archetype in general. I hope you enjoy using this deck like I do, as even now I'm still finding out some combos this deck can do depending on what cards you get stuck with, and I'm still happily beating all my friends with it (if they don't use Dragoon of course). While this is definitely my most fun deck, it is also a deck made to win, so that's why I'm labelling it non-meta."

They end up in your GY and can summon themselves from there every turn. They spam Level 4, but mostly Level 8 monster to the field. With that being said they don't really do all that much besides that. King and Queen have okay effects, getting better with Light and Dark on the field (the monsters, not the all caps attributes) and Ogdoabyss is crazy strong but not enough on its own, yet its gimmick prevents you from playing anything else really.</span>  <span>At first people tried out Invoked, since this deck doesn't rely on its Normal Summon but quickly moved on after realising that other engines actually contribute to their endboard. I mean what are Ogdoadics gonna do? Send their own Mechaba?</span>  <span>Then there was OTK Ogdoadic. You spam out Level 8 monsters, playing through a few negates thanks to cards like Kaijus, Gizmek Orochi, Beast King Alpha and OTK with Draglubion. While the Draglubion OTK engine remains in most decks, the deck itself has always felt incredibly generic. Nothing the board ended on was really unique. Neither its endboard nor its wincon.</span>  <span>After the release of the new Alien support many people, myself included, tried that out. And while this version had been the most fun and unique so far, it wasn't really the most consistent. You could summon Cosmic Slicer just fine and then summon a Kid but Kid's an uncontested Normal Summon away from being run over with its meager 1600 ATK. And even if you made it past your opponent's Normal Summon you basically ended on a single Bagooska which took twice as long to summon as regular Bagooska.</span>  <span>I think it's no stretch to say this deck was still missing something. There was the ""add 11 cards to my hand"" deck using Bishbaalkin but this deck never took off. (If you can spell Bishbaalkin correctly on your first attempt you play too much yugioh. I play too much yugioh.) By the time you draw all your cards you've already used every card effect there is so either you fill your deck up with handtraps and probably won't get to Bishbaalkin if it's not for exactly Snake Rain or you end up with 6 cards in hand which perfectly mirror your GY and essentially have become useless. And then of course you only end on slightly more than the previously mentioned discount Bagooska.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>In comes DPE.</span>  <span>DPE has taken the meta by storm. It destroys a card every turn and summons itself from the GY every Standby Phase. Let me say that again: Summons. Itself. From. The. Graveyard. Ogdoabyss won't send DPE. DPE actually works with Ogdoadics' own boss monster. Nunu is a 1,5 card combo (send for Zohah) using up your Normal Summon and Snake Rain is a 1,5 card combo (discard for cost) without a Normal Summon which end in DPE plus Ogdoabyss. While this may not seem much, it's DPE and a board wipe and thanks to Water Lily you can easily use Ogdoabyss multiple times by tributing it for Keurse and bringing it back right after. <strong>Ogdoadics have, for probably the first time, became part of their ideal endboard.</strong></span>  <span>Some thoughts and bullet points:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you destroy DPE during your own turn first, while risking of runnning into Called By the Grave, you can use Ogdoabyss first to then destroy any follow up they might still have after having their board wiped.</span></li>  	<li><span>If you open Fusion Destiny you can summon Dagda instead of Verte and pop Scythe during your opponent's turn. Neither Scythe nor DPE will be affected by Ogdoabyss.</span></li>  	<li><span>Gamma is insane in this deck and enables Chaos Ruler, which pretty much guarantees combo. Even if you mill either Dasher or Celestial with Chaos Ruler you can simply add them to your hand and still have just milled 4 cards in a GY oriented deck.</span></li>  	<li><span>Still working on some ratios but Water Lily is so easily searchable that you really don't need to open it (if you can't summon Nauya chances are you won't get enough Reptiles into the GY anyways) and after resolving it's effect twice the game should be decided by then anyways. But yeah, ratios might be subject to change.</span></li> </ul> <span>Okay Dogmatika doesn't really contribute anything unique BUT you can still Normal Summon Ecclesia after using Verte/Fusion Destiny which is cool. You can then add Dogmatika Punishment and, if you used Nadir Servant, add Fleur in End Phase with Titaniklad. They won't survive Ogdoabyss but that's fine, they'll have served their purpose.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>The 1,5 card combos.</span></span>  <span>My shift is about to end so I'll bring this one to a close. I'll quickly go over the two aforementioned combos.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Nunu + card to send:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Send Nunu from hand to send Zohah from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Add Zohah by sending the card in hand</span></li>  	<li><span>NS Zohah and SS Nunu from GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Overlay for King of the Feral Imps</span></li>  	<li><span>Imp adds Nauya from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Send Nauya from hand to send Keurse from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Imp for Keurse and then SS Nauya frrom GY with Keurse</span></li>  	<li><span>Nauya adds Water Lily from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both into Verte (Nauya gets banished) --&gt; 4 Reptiles in GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Water Lily, send and summon Ogdoabyss</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Verte for DPE</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>Snake Rain + discard OR Nunu + Nauya:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Snake rain by discarding a card in hand, sending Nunu, Nauya, Keurse and Aleirtt</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Sendung Nunu for Aleirtt and Nauya for Keurse achieves the same game state</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Summon Nunu from GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Nunu (gets banished) for Keurse and use Keurse to summon Nauya</span></li>  	<li><span>Nauya adds Water Lily</span></li>  	<li><span>Tribute Nauya (gets banished) for Aleirtt, return both Nunu and Nauya to GY with Aleirtt</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both into Verte --&gt; 4 Reptiles in GY</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Water Lily, send and summon Ogdoabyss</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Verte for DPE</span> <ul>  	<li><span>From here on out you can use Nadir Servant, sending Tinaniklad, to search and NS Ecclesia, search Punishment and add Fleur in EP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

So here you go. The digital bugs have the ability to change their level, give a boost to insect xyz monsters when used as a material, and summon each other for an xyz summon. That's the bases of this deck, get out some powerful xys monsters most people underestimate. Link monsters like access code are only there to provide support, they are not necessary but do give an advantage. Only threw in the access code because I was lucky and got one for a pack. The rest are there to support the bugs and provide cover while the boss is summoned. You don't have to stick with this exact set up, I'm sure there's ways to improve it. But if you decide to build this deck I wish you good luck and I really hope you enjoy it."

But because Doomking Balerdroch and Zombie World go together like chocolate and peanut butter, you would still prefer to go first and set up this degenerate 2-card board. Speaking of which, Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon Lord can summon a Zombie from your Graveyard during the opponent's turn, so if they try to get stop your Balerdroch from reviving itself with Called By the Grave or Ghost Belle, Zombie Dragon Lord can use his effect to revive it anyway."

So I did some experimenting and I found that with vampires and zombie world you can summon all three of these synchros on your opponent's turn if you really wanted to. I however decided that those synchros just aren't worth the extra deck space or the effort to summon them. If you want to use them go ahead, but I personally will just take Baroness De Fleur and call it a week.

======================================================================================================================================================================================  <span><strong>Notes:</strong></span>  -This deck is cyberbullied so badly by hand traps that they will literally never be meta. 9 times out of 10 you just hope to either open with crossout designator/called by the grave or your opponent has no hand traps. I wouldn't recommend playing this against a deck that plays a lot of hand traps/counter traps since there is only so much you can do to stop them  -If your wondering how to summon all the other new synchros with this deck, it mostly involves using formula synchron 3 times on your opponent's turn. Jack-O-Bolan/Hela and the level 10 synchro both can do that pretty easily, I don't do it cuz its a lot of extra deck space and only rlly performed through with 1 combo.  -If you have a level 5 or higher in your hand and Vampire Sucker on the field, try not to forget you can tribute your opponent's monsters for a tribute summon (while you have zombie world). If you can get Vampire Ghost Ogre in Grave you can do it on your opponent's turn.  -Swapping to TCG rules is easy, just remove 1 called by the grave and add 1 Crossout Designator  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  <span><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span>  I originally made this deck to keep up with my friends playing super strong meta decks and super strong combo decks. What ended up happening however is I found myself preferring to play Vampires with Vampire Kingdom over zombie world. That said,  Zombie World is definitely better and my friend plays eldlich so don't take my advice on which to play. The side deck is kinda thrown together, not much thought in it. I'm open to any advice, if you have an idea you should post it so others know too. Leave a like if you enjoyed the deck, and thanks for reading."

Honestly a welcome consistency card for getting to network as well since Lava Golem and Numeron Wall are both Fiends. There aren't many monsters in the deck so the lines of what gets to what are pretty simple.  Reveal Wall ----&gt; Ash ----&gt; Lava Golem and vice versa  Reveal Gadarla ----&gt; Lava Golem ----&gt; Vanity's Ruler or Ash or Wall  I am main decking Vanity's Ruler and Solemn Judgment because there's enough blowout cards to deal with basically any deck, so you have the room to just play going 1st cards as well in case someone figures out your strategy and thinks they can make you start. You don't need to do this, you can just play even more going 2nd cards if you wish.  As for the extra deck, I'd say the only cards you care about are the numerons obviously, the Apollousa, the Saryuja, and the Megaclops. Cards like Goddess seem good and can catch your opponent off guard, but Borrelcode and Zeroboros could be anything else that you prefer.  In the side, the only card of note is probably Link Bound, I found this card to be good at clearing monsters off of your field so you can activate network while also recycling a monster and potentially fixing your hand. You probably only ever want to see this card going 1st so that's why it's in the side."

That's what I'm Talking About!  The idea is originally to trigger the TD's using Invoked/Evil hero, but the prices aren't that acessible even right now with a reprint.  Then shaddolls came! And it solved everything, along with the monarch S/T engine to thin your deck. Need a boss monster? Odd-eyes advance dragon can burn your opponent removing threats, as well revive shaddolls and thunder dragons.  This is strictly supposed to play second, if you go first, at best you can tribute your opponent's monster to set a shaddoll beast.  Have fun!"

You don't need 3 Baby in this deck if you play correctly most of the time it won't be missed, some of the combos you can do with just one Babycerasarus. Archosaur has never required more than one copy in the deck and in this version even less, you only need to resolve Archosaur once in the game and I prefer to have Oviraptor and Scrap Raptor as Normal Summons. And speaking of Scrap engine you only need two Scrap Raptor and Chimera in the main deck, as I show in combos you can do full combo using only one Scrap Raptor. Regarding the Ogdoadic engine what I see most people asking is why I use Aron instead of other better Ogdoadic cards and I know why they think Aron is bad because they play Ogdoadic and in the pure version strategy there are bosses much better monsters but in this version Aron fills the needs I need like the 5th name of Ogdoadic. The extra deck I wouldn't change anything, each card helps me a lot, of course I would like to have room for more versatility cards like Lambda or Castel but for now I don't miss it. The Side deck are just examples of good cards for you to dig and play in GY with the Chaos Ruler effect, it's not a real side deck although I think it's very good to test Mind Control and Bigfoot! mainly for being lv8, having 3k atk that takes a Dragoon for example and having the possibility to take out floodgates like Imperial Order and Anti-Spell. Finally, on the gameplay of why the deck is interesting: Turn 1 you usually spend with what Dino does best which is Tyranno + Dolkka and what Ogdoadic does best which is a Rank8 but what makes this deck oppressor are the follow ups, on the way back you have the Scrap engine threatening Borreload Savage, you can have Chaos Ruler in the GY that along with the Ogdoadic engine threatens Dingirsu, you also easily threaten to do Exciton Knight, there's Misc + Rex that threaten Tyranno / Pankratops + a Rank4 which is giant in the grind game. So you generate so much advantage in GY that it's no use your opponent breaking your field, he'll have to OTK because otherwise your turn is scary. This is not the new secret deck that destroys the meta but I believe it is the best way to still play Dino besides being fun and requiring considerable skill because it is not linear, each combo I present can be done differently depending on from gamestate, there are times when you can connect only the Ogdoadic engine and the Dino engine is like Follow Up waiting for a draw to debrick or the other way around.  Below are all the combos I learned from this deck: The basic deck combo is from the standard Scrap Dino moves like Oviraptor + Baby = Misc + Baby = Archosaur + Baby = Oviraptor + Misc I hope you can understand the plays I made because some of these replays are not in a didactic way because they are more test hands that I do randomly mainly in the Scrap part which has more details of the cards I destroyed for each effect that activates or times I add the Double Evolution Pill to my hand out of the blue because I forgot to add it when using Archosaur, which are things you forget when training in a manual simulator. I like to use the expression Cyber Punk 2077 when I find a really good combo that nobody does with the deck and you'll see I have some of them on this list.  Place the URL continuation on the duelingbook site after .com/  replay?id=621416-34750463 Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus Dinosaur Ogdoadic Combo ROUTE of Chaos Ruler excavate Nunu = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Giant Rex + Number 38 or Dingirsu. Using Chaos Ruler to access the Scrap engine is possible but it depends on luck if you can add Nunu or Nauya to your hand which I don't recommend. Play Around Lightning Storm. Don't play Around Super Poly if you make Number 38.  replay?id=813757-33319802 Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus Dinosaur Ogdoadic Combo King of the Feral Imps ROUTE = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Giant Rex + Number 38 or Dingirsu  replay?id=813757-33348537 Deck Full Combo - the apex using Chaos Ruler (not playing around hand trap) doing Evolzar Dolkka only in the middle of the combo = Tyranno + Dolkka + I:P + Number 97 and Number 38 + Possible Gamma in Hand that you can add with Chaos Ruler. I was still using the Number 97 engine in this replay but nowadays I see that the Rank 8 Toolbox I use today is much better. I thought the idea presented in this combo was cool so I'm including it too.  replay?id=813757-33376148 Version 2 of the deck's Full Combo = Tyranno + Dolkka + Savage + Number 38  replay?id=813757-33376688 Full Combo Version 3 = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Number 38 /in GY: Chaos Ruler and Misc and Rex and Ogdoadic monsters /in Hand: monster that you added with Chaos Ruler.  replay?id=813757-33373914 Lost World + Scrap Raptor (Don't Play Around Hand Traps) = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Linkuriboh + Number 38 or 68 or Dingirsu (In this combo Oviraptor destroys the Token in the opponent's field to reborn Babycerasaurus but the DB won't let me destroy it, just to be clear)  replay?id=813757-33348273 Full Combo with 1 Scrap Raptor and playing around Hand Trap = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Giant Rex + Number 38 or Dingirsu and Scrap Raptor in Hand  replay?id=813757-33374185 Full Combo Cyber ​​Punk 2077 with 1 Scrap Raptor (Don't Playing Around Hand Traps) = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Chimera + Number 38 or 68 or Dingirsu (It's Combo Cyber ​​Punk 2077 because your Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is not just Book of Eclipse but a pop without targeting additionally because you destroy Scrap Chimera and Scrap Wyvern's eff trigger to give summon from Scrap Raptor that we still have in the deck to pop a card without targeting, that way you don't need to use Tyranno's effect so early in the combo)  replay?id=813757-33348803 Lost World + Oviraptor (Use Chaos Ruler) = Tyranno + Wyvern + (Number 97 or Number 38 or Number 68) /in Hand: Possible Gamma added with Chaos Ruler /in GY: Misc in GY + Chaos Ruler Or replay?id=813757-33480783 Lost World + Oviraptor (Chaos Ruler ROTA) = Tyranno + Masquerena I:P + Number 38 /in Hand: Add of Chaos Ruler /in GY: Misc + Chaos Ruler follow up + half of the Ogdoadic names  replay?id=813757-33374505 Cyber ​​Punk Combo 2077 Oviraptor + Miscellaneousaurus Blind Second = Exciton Knight + Number 38 or Number 68 + Misc in GY (It's not hard to make Exciton Knight with the Ogdoadic engine too) Or replay?id=813757-34766275 Cyber ​​Punk Combo 2077 Lost World + Oviraptor Blind Second = Exciton Knight + Tyranno + Pankratops + Wyvern + Chimera  replay?id=813757-33374781 Lost World + Babycerasaurus Blind Second combo (Play Around Hand Traps) = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Giant Rex + Number 38 or 68 or Dingirsu  replay?id=813757-33335815 Nauya + anymonster = Number 97 or Number 38 or Number 68 /in GY: 4 more important of the Ogdoadic names This is good if for example you give NS Ovirapor and the opponent denies it to extend moves and pass with something that guarantees you to survive.  replay?id=813757-33334708 Nunu + any Level4 Dinosaur = Number 38 or Number 68 + Ogdoadic Spell/Trap  replay?id=813757-33335402 Nunu + anyLv4Dino = I:P Masq + Aron, the Ogdoadic King  replay?id=813757-33333176 Snake Rain + Discard = Number 97 + Number 38 or Number 68 and Ogdoadic Spell/Trap in Hand  replay?id=813757-33336243 Snake Rain + Discard = I:P Masq + Aron, the Ogdoadic King  replay?id=813757-33337033 Archosaur + Giant Rex (any Dino Lv4) = Rank 8  replay?id=813757-33364312 Oviraptor + Double Evolution Pill = Tyranno + Rank 8 (better to make Number 97 and Number 38) /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Top 4 Ogdoadic names  Scrap Raptor = Rank 4 (Bagooska) or Rank 8  replay?id=813757-33379833 Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Chaos Ruler ROUTE = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Aron + Number 38 /in Hand: Possible monster added with Chaos Ruler eff /in GY: Misc + all the Ogdoadic Names (At the end of the combo it was strange that I summoned Nauya from the deck but actually I made a mistake because I was supposed to send Aron straight to GY and then summon the resolution and this Nauya was supposed to be in the Deck)  replay?id=813757-33379559 Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Borreload Savage ROUTE = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Borreload Savage + Rank 8 /in Hand: Possible monster added with Chaos Ruler eff /in GY: Misc + half of the Ogdoadic names (In this combo I Missplayed not to destroy the King of the Feral Imps after the summon of the second Scrap Raptor so I had an extra body on the table and I could do I:P Masquerena. I ask you to redo this combo because most likely this one I:P should not be on the final board, the rest of the monsters remain the same but there may be some significant change in the Ogdoadic activation sequence lv8)  replay?id=813757-33433361 Oviraptor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Chaos Ruler ROUTE = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Masquerena I:P + Number 38  replay?id=813757-33433724 Ovirapor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Borreload Savage ROUTE = Tyranno + Dolkka + Borreload Savage + Number 38  replay?id=813757-33434633 Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus Combo King of the Feral Imps ROUTE works = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Aleirtt /in GY: 3 Ogdoadic names + Misc (The second test hand with the Chaos Ruler ROUTE shows why it's a risky play, you may just not be able to dig out any Ogdoadic names and have the entire combo hurt)  replay?id=813757-33380488 Snake Rain + Scrap Raptor = Masquerena I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Chaos Ruler + all the Ogdoadic names /in Hand: Search of Chaos Ruler (The first time I had summoned from Aron because of the autopilot but you must summon from Nauya to access Bagooska)  replay?id=813757-33382243 Snake Rain + Oviraptor the 3 possible situations: First: Archosaur add Double Evolution Pill and make Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena /in Hand: Double Evolution Pill + Ogdoadic Spell/Trap (discard of Knightmare Unicorn) /in GY: Misc + 3 ogdoadic names Second: add Misc and let him down and pass with I:P Masquerena + Aron + an Ogdoadic Monster in the Hand (discard of Knightmare Unicorn) + Misc. (I was undecided about activating the spell Water Lily or the Nauya effect and after that I saw that it makes a lot more sense to use Spell in this case) Third: Use Archosaur to add an Ogdoadic name and pass with I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Misc and all the Ogdoadic names. This combo is also possible if the Snake Rain dropout is a Reptile so you can add the Pill straight to the hand which is much better.  replay?id=813757-34766606 what do you do if you draw one of the bricks(Keurse or Aleirtt)? Simple, do the combo normally and at the end do Unicorn and use the eff to shuffle himself back to the extra deck and that way you can discard the Brick to the GY. This was a move that Adamancipator with Block Dragon did a lot, but in their case it wasn't to take a Brick from the deck, but to open space on the field to give summons from Block Dragon. (In this combo I should have sent Nunu to GY instead of Aron because that way the Ogdoadic engine would be complete with the top 4 names in circulation)"

You can still manage backrow decks with the likes of Denko but your G1 is severely hindered by them so if you wanted to play it in a backrow heavy environment, Denko should be considered in the main over something like Chalice or Droplet. List is definitely cuttable to a straight 40 if you wanted to go this route as you could replace one of the monster negates in the main with Harpie's Feather Duster instead for example. If you wish to play the list in the current format, just cut White Exalted of Dogmatika and Dogmatikabre and the deck will function almost the same but with slightly less power. Nadir Servant being able to send Herald Of The Arc Light to search either of the Dogamtika Rituals and then benefit the Nekroz monsters with the search from Herald Of The Arc Light is really nice as well as Dogmatikalamity being able to send Herald Of The Arc Light in order to summon White Exalted of Dogmatika in the same way that Nekroz Kaleidoscope is another feature that is nice to have whilst also boosting the attack of something such as Nekroz of Unicore in order to make it more difficult to attack over in the process.  &nbsp;  Unfortunately, the deck does lose really hard to Droll &amp; Lock Bird but thankfully with the decline in popularity of Drytron in the current meta, Droll &amp; Lock Bird is being switched out for some other handtraps outside of combo decks that can use it and then proceed to put big bodies on the board and attempt to OTK you. I would do a combos section but your main thing is that you play whichever engine you draw while trying to get yourself to the other half of deck in the process through the use of Nadir Servant, Dogmatikalamity and Nekroz Kaleidoscope. Any other questions please feel free to ask. I do by no means think that this deck will be Tier 1, but it will certainly be able to deal with them in a Rouge capacity."

How we get there is pretty typical for cyberdark decks: use Cannon and Claw to search creatures and spells, respectively, with the goal of filling up the graveyard and hand with at least 5 cyberdark monsters. Use chimera to search for Power Bond, and fuse your boss monster. We have two Power Bonds, in case we open with one, and we're running one Attachment Cybern and three Cyberdark Invasion to allow Cyberdarkness dragon to have more negates.  If our boss monsters are destroyed, we can recurse them with Cyber Eternal, which we can search with Cyber Dragon Core. Our main source of removal is attacking, but we can also use Jizukiru to tribute an opponents monster, then fuse him with our Cyber Dragon Core to make Chimeratech Fortress Dragon.  In the extra deck, Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf is there in case we can't make it to full combo.  One of the deck's big weak spots is its inability to draw. If we make our boss monsters and they are removed, we need cards in hand to make followup plays, so try to conserve your hand as best as possible."

Then, use Red Rising's effect to special summon the lvl 2 tuner you used. If it's red resonator you can gain 2100 lp and go into Scarlet Red Dragon and if it's crimson resonator you can bring out two resonators from your deck (like red resonator and synkron resonator) which you can use to go into other boss monsters like Hot Red Dragon, Tyrant Red Dragon, King Calamity or even Red Supernova. Allure, Resonator Call, Resonator Command, Witch of the Black Forest and Synkron Resonator all help get cards needed to start combos and extend combos. The Synchro boss monsters (lvl 9+) also protect themselves and other monsters with their negates or swarm the field with resonators or lower level Synchro monster so you can go into bigger Synchro monsters. This deck is a first turn deck but can also work on second turn if you opponent doesn't have facedowns."

Only use <span>Obedience Schooled if needed because it prevents you from making your boss monsters. You want to get two low-level monsters with a one-level difference on the field to go into polari. Then try and get a level 8 monster in your gy and a level 7 on the field. Then use polari's effect to send the level 7 to the gy and get the level 8 and you should be able to get out your boss monsters.</span>

Sorry it's been awhile....</p> (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/jnWfuCNJ7R8"">https://youtu.be/jnWfuCNJ7R8</a>)  So it has been awhile since I made a decently put together deck that is just as generic as my confidence for life. Anywho, because WCS season is around, and we all know it will be a blood bath that makes 2008 look like someone knocked over a bottle of water; let me clarify that I think Lyrilusc - Tri-Brigade will hold out the longest of all the current decks running around before then. However doesn't mean that Lyrilusc can hold their own with or without the entity of the Tri-Brigade. This time it is not Fraktall that is leading the charge at all. Sure he can mill, be Kit's side posse, and hold on better than Kerass; but in reality, Nervall is the one doing the important work by searching out the needed Birds for the plays that truly matter.  On the note of how the lyrilusc monsters can be useful here, let's say that I'm glad to have Crossout Designator in this deck. The reason in this case is because Special Summoning is your best friend on all fronts; from XYZ summoning, to Link Summoning, to even GY setup. What this gets you is the Utopic Future package. A very obscure package that brings you ""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"": an XYZ monster that negates and steals monsters from your opponent to use them however you want to. Other than that nothing has basically changed out of this aspiring hybrid that has so many chances of making a truly versatile impact."

No seriously, this deck is actually good.","https://youtu.be/N566PCNAK3E  Sharks are an oddity. The archetype itself never did anything relevant in the era it was introduced (Zexal). It mostly was just pack filler. Thanks to last year's set Eternity Code and this year's Brothers of Legend , the deck can finally function!  The deck aims to use Buzzsaw shark and a number of extenders to make rank 4's and control the game.  Number 4: Stealth Kragen is a great control tool. Combined with Gozen Match, you can create a very potent lock that is difficult to out.  You also have easy access to Utopic Draco Future  I purposely omitted a side deck, as you can just chose what fits to your local metagame.  Feedback appreciated"

This Archetype is starving for decent support. No the Gaias don't count, I have desperatly tried to make them work, it ends in pain. No the new Fusion dosen't count either, That one was made for Dark Magician.  You could probably improve the deck (especially the extra deck) a bit more but this is what im rolling with mainly cuz i don't know any other good cards and also laziness.  Just get the Field Spell, Slam that sucker down, go for isolde, get Super Soldier Soul, send his ass to the GY, pop his GY effect to yoink a beginning or evening knight out of the deep dark pits of your deck, use the tokens on the Field Spell and then get the boi out there! Jarngreipr is there for protection if you are either going first, have 2 lvl 1 monsters or have bricked. Puppets cause GY setup into Kaiza and Kaiza cause more GY setup either through Super Soldier Soul or Kaiki for Gilti-Gearfried. Why am I using Vanilla BLS? Because Super Soldier ritual Sucks (in this deck at least).  And also because on the off chance that you want to Ritual summon twice.  Why no Pre-Prep? You got 5 cards to get BLS and a Ritual Spell into your hands AND Pre-Prep only gets the vanilla Spell, not Synthesis (which btw lets u summon from the hand and GY, which is why Trade-in is there)."

This gameplan has 2 big, overlapping issues: <ol>  	<li>It's impossible to achieve turn 1.</li>  	<li>The painters don't offer any meaningful interaction during your opponent's turn in order to survive the turn.</li> </ol> In an attempt to last for long enough to actually get Rainbow out, I'm playing the mother of all floodgates, Mystic Mine. Through Cloudy and Snowy Canvas, you can always keep the number of monsters on your field between 1 and 0 to keep Mine live while you accumulate Painters into rotation, and kill it when you want to push for game.  The deck goes second to make Mine live and to take advantage of one of the Painters' strongest interactions, bouncing Kaijus to hand with Thundery Canvas. The Kaijus serve as recurring removal and they help you actually resolve Mine by taking out any spell negates or quick removal your opponent may have without letting your opponent respond.  &nbsp;  The ED practically doesn't matter, so I'm just playing a bunch of Maximus targets, a chonky Zeus package and an Accesscode suite, but you can pretty much just play whatever you want. You can probably even add a DPE package in there, but I'm already running a Mine deck and I don't want to overdose on cringe.  &nbsp;  The side has barely been tested so it might be a bit janky, but you have a bunch of cards for going first and some backrow hate because the deck kinda struggles against trap decks."

Kind of! I decided to name it ""Yuri the Ravenous Dragon"" after Yuri, the power-hungry user of this archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V.  So here is a Predaplant deck profile featuring the new support from Dimension Force and an Albaz engine! Thanks to two of the Pendulum Monsters that Predaplants got, the deck can Fusion Summon and use Predator Counters much more easily! Branded Fusion can be used to send Predaplant Byblisp to the Graveyard, and then search a different Predaplant for further plays.  &nbsp;  Ideally, this deck can do good going first or second--having both hand trap negation in the Main Deck and backrow removal in the Side Deck--but for me personally, I tend to do better going first."

It's mostly all just level 4 extenders that aim to get you an endboard of Leo Utopia Ray with Pegasus equipped for 2 monster negates, Zombiestein for an omninegate and a Dragonar with 2 materials leftover that you can use on your opponent's turn to get either a Hope Harbinger, Kragen, or even Bagooska in some really desperate situations, depending on what your opponent does. Going second, you either do like every other deck that plays 2 monsters with the same level and go straight into Zeus (through either Utopia into Prime for a 4-mat Zeus or an attack position Bagooska to ensure you get to summon the Zeus in the first place) or you punch something really hard with Utopia Double.  &nbsp;  Before I get shit for running 46 cards, the deck has 3 different engine requirements you really don't want to draw (Double or Nothing, Pegasus and the Rank-Up) and since pretty much every card is just an extender, it doesn't cause consistency issues. If you're completely set on making every one of your decks exactly 40 cards because you have yugituber brain-rot, I'd cut Astral Kuriboh, 1 each of Zubababancho and Onomatopoeia, an Xyz Change Tactics, Shade Brigandine and Armed Sage.  The deck is also not playing F0 because you usually have to do some pretty suboptimal stuff (or draw an absolute god hand) to make it turn 1 and it takes up a lot of Extra Deck space, but feel free to run it if you want to.  Another option to consider is Traptrix Rafflesia with Gravedigger's Trap Hole to avoid dying to Nibiru, but personally I think the deck is running enough bricks already and you need a pretty good hand to summon Rafflesia before you go into Nibiru range and keep going afterwards."

The first deck I ever created myself. Fairly standard Blue-Eyes deck with plenty of fusions, synchro and xyz monsters, plus a couple ritual summons thrown into the mix. Heavily reliant on support cards and spells/traps to get as many strong Blue-Eyes monsters onto the field and finish the duel quickly. Discounting bad luck on the draw, usually plays out very nicely and heavily in your favour if you can effectively utilise monster effects and spells/traps at the right times."

The ones i used are pretty much just examples and you can switch them out with anything (same with the Side). Though i would definitely recommend using Halqifibrax, since Synthess can copy the effect of the Tuner you summon with it and Rocks, since getting back a Symphonic Warrior from the Extra can help alot with extending your combos and it can profit off the Level increase Effect of Basses. In addition to that Stardust Warrior can also be helpful, since it can summon a (face-down) Warrior Rocks, when it leaves the Field (main reason i used 2 copies of Rocks here). You can summon Stardust Warrior relatively easy with any level 7 Synchro plus Halqifibrax tagging into Shooting Riser and sending a Level 4 to the Grave (mainly Synthess to have another free Summon on your next turn). Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider can also be Summoned pretty easily, because most Synchros i used and all the Symphonic Warriors are Wind (Speedroids in general work well with Symphonic Warriors. So do Windwitches and Dragunity.). Virtual World Kyubi can also reset Synthess to use it again (only the Pendulum Symphonic Warriors have hard once per turn Effects). Now to the combos. They can be both very linear and also not. With Deejays/Guitaar to Summon Deejays and Stardust Synchron/Stardust Illumination to mill Synchron in Hand you can directly Summon Majestic Star Dragon or Shooting Majestic Star Dragon (you need Illumination in your Grave to Summon Shooting Majestic Star). <blockquote><div>Summon Deejays and Summon another Monster with it's Effect  Tribute the seccond Monster with Synchron's Effect  search Arrive in Light, activate it and place Converging Wills Dragon on your Deck  Tune Deejays with Synchron for Stardust Dragon, Draw the Dragon and Summon it and Brotaur from your Deck with it's Effect  (optional) Discard 1 for Brotaur's Effect and Target Stardust to search Arma Gram for another Beater and a Negate on your Turn (you could also search Dragonruler Tempest or Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, if you are playing around with Dragons more)  now you could use the Effect of Illumination to Summon Shooting Majestic Star or just go into the normal Majestic Star</div></blockquote> &nbsp;  As for the Symphonic Warriors themselves, they can have some interesting plays depending on what cards you draw (mainly if you have Dress Rehearsal or Symph Amplifire or not). They do however have one 2 Card combo that could be considered as their main starting play. <blockquote><div>Summon Deejays and Summon Synthess (face-down) with it's Effect  activate Guitaris' Pendulum Effect to bounce itself and Deejays  activate Deejays' Pendulum Effect to Flip Synthess face-up  Synthess Flip Effect activates to let you Search a Symphonic Warrior-Monster (Miccs and Guitaris can Special themselves, when you have the Spells on the Field and when you have Summoned Deejays via Guitaar and still have your Normal, you can use that Search for another copy of Guitaar for it's Revive on Normal Effect instead. Alternatively you can use Guitaris' on Summon Effect to bounce the Guitaar from your Pendelum Zone to then Summon it)  Deejays' Effect activates after Synthess' Effect resolves to Summon itself back to the Field</div></blockquote> &nbsp;  This is my first time submitting a Deck, so don't expect it to be the best, but i am having fun with it haha Personally i'm not the biggest fan of Handtraps, so you could probably enhance it yourself by putting in some copies of Ash Blossom and similar. The Deck itself is very fragile, when it has to go against Ash or Nibiru, but when you Draw the Cards you need and don't get disrupted, you can make some impressive Boards. Also before i started with this Deck i haven't played much with Pendulums. I didn't even know that they had to be Summoned from the Extra to Linked Zones haha There might be some generic Pendulum Support that could have helped the Deck lots.  Well anyways thanks for taking the time to look at this and if you have a Deck that could profit from another Normal Summon, 3 Guitaar with 1 Miccs might help lol"

Battle Royal Mode - Joining),"  I'm not gonna lie, when the Spell ""Battle Royal Mode - Joining"" was revealed, I was genuinely at a loss on how to use it. The card is casual trash, but I still wanted to think of SOME way to play it well! So after a morning energy drink and some sunny-side up eggs, I had my light bulb moment: I was gonna use it in Trains! I named this particular deck ""PAIN TRAIN"" after the song ""Here Comes The Pain Train"" by Jay Harper.  &nbsp;  See, Juggernaut Liebe can attack monsters 1 more time for each Xyz Material it has, which means you can target your opponent's Effect Monster with Battle Royal Mode - Joining, so that it has to battle 3 times before it can be destroyed. Liebe can then attack it at least twice (and even use its other effect to increase its ATK to 6000 beforehand) to OTK the opponent!  &nbsp;  Because Trains is an unga bunga Deck, you want to go second 110% of the time. I also put a bunch of hand traps, 3 Dark Ruler, and Lightning Storm in the Side Deck in case you are facing a stronger, more competitive Deck."

This deck has a nice toolbox of Monsters and Spells, all easily accessible and recyclable, allowing you to outplay and outpace countless other strategies with proper play and a bit of luck.  Thanks to the release of the new Fusion Monster Witchcrafter Vice-Master the deck has gotten a much stronger end-boss and a much higher ceiling. As such, it only makes sense to aim to put her onto the field ASAP, and this build tries to do just that. Cards like Magicians' Souls and Magician's Restage, which were previously clunky and unnecessary, are now powerful extenders for producing Predaplant Verte Anaconda. Combined with Magicalized Fusion, this makes it extremely easy to get out Vice-Master turn 1 and get the ball rolling. Generic spellcaster Link-1s make link-climbing even easier, and the nearly entirely spellcaster Extra Deck synergizes extremely well with Vice-Master to allow for some disgusting turn 3+ plays, especially as the typing in this deck allows you to make every Charmer link, as well as Selene , Queen of the Master Magicians (who can also be used to reborn/trigger Vice-Master as a quick-effect). Furthermore, nearly every extra deck monster can be recycled with Patronus, allowing you to easily manipulate the board state turn after turn.  My ratios and reasoning are as follows:   <strong>3x Witchcrafter Schmietta: </strong>Hands-down the best of the starters both in statline and effect. Vice-Master allows you to get creative with your plays involving Schmietta, as you can often mill a card and then quickly add it to your hand to be used (such as Patronus) <strong>3x Witchcrafter Genni: </strong>Not quite as good as Schmietta, but she has enough utility that I run her at 3. She's the best way of accessing Golem Aruru early on, and can allow you to play through interruptions depending on your hand, but she can occasionally be dead with nothing to copy. You could easily cut her to 2 or even 1, but I've so far liked having a decent number of starters to work with. <strong>2x Witchcrafter Pittore: </strong>She can help cycle dead cards out of your hand, but generally she's just worse than the previous two. I run 2 just to keep up the number of names in the deck, but you could easily play 1-0. <strong>1x Witchcrafter Potterie: </strong>Deceptively powerful in the right situations, Potterie helps keep cards in your hand and enables comeback plays if you ever end up in a situation where you're stuck topdecking. That being said, I would probably never play more than 1 as she's typically only good past turn 1. <strong>1x each of Witchcrafter Golem Aruru, Madame Verre, Haine and Edel: </strong>The big bosses are all huge bricks and as such should never be ran at anything higher than 1. You can access them all extremely easily, recycle them from nearly anywhere, and Vice-Master gives you an Extra Deck boss in case you somehow lose them all. Of these, Edel is the worst and is usually only good in corner cases where you draw into the other bosses, but her being summonable off of Vice-Master does allow for some interesting plays. <strong>3x Magicians' Souls: </strong>While Souls used to be mostly pointless to run, it now serves as an extremely efficient card for setting up a fusion of Vice-Master off of Magicalized Fusion and can be used as an extender to make Verte. Furthermore, Souls cycles spells out of your hand to dig deeper into your deck, and in combination with Magician's Restage allows you to generate a ton of resources early on (as you can summon Souls, link it off, activate Restage, revive Souls, then use Souls to send Restage and draw + get the search off of Restage and make Verte for Vice-Master). I would certainly not drop this anymore, and have even considered playing the new Dark Magician Ritual Monster (Illusion of Chaos) to search it.  <strong>3x Witchcrafter Creation, Holiday and Unveiling: </strong>Creation gets you your monsters, Holiday is your best extender through disruptions, and Unveiling makes your cards unrespondable for a turn. Ratios of the spells are somewhat flexible but I wouldn't cut more than 1-2 between Holiday and Unveiling. <strong>1x Witchcrafter Draping, Collaboration, Bystreet, Scroll and Confusion: </strong>The ""bad"" spells, all ran at 1. Each one has its use and serves as another name in the deck, but you can afford to cut these down if you want more room. Scroll and Collaboration are especially niche and tend to be winmore when actually using them beyond discard fodder, but Draping, Bystreet and Confusion are all solid enough to warrant running them at 1. <strong>3x Magicalized Fusion: </strong>In combination with any starter, Magicalized Fusion cheats out Vice-Master and gets your gameplan moving. All of the level 4 or lower Witchcrafters can be linked off for Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden, giving you the required materials for Vice-Master instantly. Furthermore, it can easily be sent off of Verte Anaconda at basically any point to give you a secondary way of accessing Vice-Master if your plays get interrupted. I would run at least the 1, but since opening it is ideal, I personally play 3. <strong>3x Magician's Restage + 1 each of Magician's Left/Right Hand: </strong>Restage is just another extender/recovery option, much like Holiday, but can also be traded out for a decent floodgate in the form of the Left/Right Hands. If nothing else, Restage is the best discard fodder in the deck, and enables some nice plays with Magicians' Souls. To make things even better, neither effect is a HOPT, so opening multiple is rarely an issue. I play 3/1/1, but you could play around with the ratios if you so choose. <strong>2x Witchcrafter Patronus: </strong>The only Trap in the deck, Patronus allows you to cycle resources and keep spells in your hand in the grind game. As Vice-Master can recover it from the GY, it is now ""searchable"" off of Schmietta/Vice-Master and as such I only play the 2 copies (1 to use and 1 as a backup/for the banish effect), but you could easily play 3 or 1 depending on your preference.  <strong>2x Witchcrafter Vice-Master</strong><strong>: </strong><em>The</em> boss monster of the deck, Vice-Master is everything you could ever want and more. She raises the ceiling of your end board, gives you more disruption, keeps monsters on your field and cards in your hand. All 3 of her effects are good, she's easy to make and can be revived/recycled as required. I play 2 as sometimes it's easier to summon a new one than to recycle an old one, but you could get away with 1 copy if you desired. <strong>1x Relinquished Anima and Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden: </strong>Both link 1s serve as a way of getting Witchcrafters/Magicians' Souls into the GY for their effects, to be revived to extend into Verte, or to be used with Magicalized Fusion. Furthermore, these allow you to easily go into Lyna/Dharc using the small Witchcrafters on turn 3+ to push for lethal with Selene + Accesscode Talker. <strong>1x Verte Anaconda: </strong>The easiest way to make Vice-Master, and a nice backup option after your plays get interrupted. Easy to make and typically only needed once, so I play just the 1 copy. <strong>1x of Hiita, Wynn, Eria, Aussa, Lyna and Dharc (the Charmer Links): </strong>As this deck has a member of each attribute, you can make any of these depending on what you need at any given moment. Their spellcaster typing also means that they trigger Vice-Master and can be recycled with Patronus, not to mention that they all ladder into Selene using the stolen monster they summon. I like having one of each of them, but feel free to cut the ones you need less if you find yourself wanting more room. <strong>1x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians: </strong>Selene is an absolutely insane card in this deck, allowing for all sorts of weird plays once your engine has been established. She triggers Vice-Master as a quick-effect, can summon any Witchcrafter from hand/GY, and can be recycled with Patronus. The high Spell count of the deck means she'll almost always have a good number of Spell Counters on summon. Selene also enables an exact lethal OTK by making a 5300 ATK Accesscode Talker + the 2700 ATK Vice-Master, and this can be done extremely easily using the Charmer links. <strong>1x Knightmare Unicorn, Accesscode Talker and Underworld Goddess of the Closed World: </strong>The utility links. Knightmare Unicorn is for niche cases where you need a non-destructive removal option quickly, Accesscode is for breaking boards and pushing for game, and Underworld Goddess is for outing problematic monsters (Dragoon, The Arrival Cyberse, an I:P-boosted Avramax, etc.). All 3 of these are easily accessed thanks to the Charmer links and Vice-Master, which allow you to amass a surprisingly high number of bodies (hence the inclusion of Underworld Goddess).  (The side deck is fairly experimental.

Virtual World extra deck monster.  try to change some cards that fit your playsty","even if this deck has 50 cards on it, this deck is still consistent. this deck trying to combine some level 3 monster that has Psychic-type. myuta has level 3 baby with psychic-type and myutant can play when the baby is on hand to connect the level 8 monster + 1 myutant spell/trap, and myutant field spell on hand, you still can do PUNK. combo :) the level 8 myutant can be a dead card so you can discard it for another card effect that needs to discard/banish 1 card from hand. some other level-3 with psychic can support the PUNK archetype fine because PUNK boss monster (the synchro lv 11) can shuffle as many cards as the level 3 psychic on the GY. I use Overdrive Teleporter because he can provide some good extender combo and instant level 9 synchro, but you must normal summon him. for the extra deck monster I use myutant because they are good boss monster, virtual world extra deck monster card can be a good control card and some psychic extra deck monster like the new level 11 psychic boss monster :) and there some rank 3 xyz if you cannot synchro or fusion. Leviair the Sea Dragon can recycle the banished monster and reuse the effect like NyanNyan. the side deck contain some card that can be helpful too depending on your playing style. Lava Golem can help kill the unkillable monster too :)  for starter hand if you have the more than 1 level 3 monster/punk monsters or 1 punk monster that can summon another PUNK monster (in this case the level 8 PUNK or Noh PUNK Seamin) you can start your combo. (but if only Noh PUNK Seamin on hand and no other monster, your best monster for that turn are just 1 of the lv 8 I'm afraid or you can search for Noh PUNK Foxy Tune(the white lv 8) to special summon 1 level 3 punk and do xyz, or you have other alternative depend on the situation but still 1 seamin still better than 1 other level 3 punk :) Overdrive Teleporter can be a good combo extender try to call 2 card that you need (maybe Noh PUNK Seamin and the baby myutant or other 2 monsters depending on your situation) and try to access the level 9 synchro if you want or another type of board that you want :)  sadly I think this deck need more recycler like psychic overload/pot series. but still, a deck with 50 cards on it can still repeat the combo 1-4 times before run out of resource and some extra deck monster like Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen and Psy-framelord omega can do some little bit recycle with NyanNyan :)"

If u, sadly, go second, hope to draw lightning storm or you will probably lose.  The strategy is really easy, set-up your backrow, interrupt opponents plays and hit hard with ""Lord of heavenly prison"" and the Parshath monster that you summon with ""Rebirth of Parshath"".  If you expect the opponent to destroy your backrow, set ""Waking the dragons"" to summon what do you want from the Extra Deck.

From the high level insects we have 4 options and the <a data-name=""Gadarla"">Gadarla</a> is not necessarily part of the priority targets of the Resonance Insect as it does not generate any type of combo but an interruption to be accessed when necessary.  The number of Normal Summons and Extender should be high because you need to have a two-card combination to make any combo as you need to access the extra deck's Links for your engine to spin out of inertia and how costly this task is once you is Link-2 or higher you need that amount of cards for the deck to work. As these Link-2 <a data-name=""Picofalena"">Picofalena</a> and <a data-name=""Armor Horn"">Armor Horn</a> are very sensitive to interactions, you often depend on your Starters to be able to bypass any hand traps or other interactions on these cards and that's why <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a>, <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a> and <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole </a>are key pieces in the deck's operation as they are very versatile and can be a interrupt against annoying monsters like Winda in the case of Sting the Poison or adding <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> and Gadarla in the case of Resonance Insect or Vanilla for the hand with Gokipole and that way you build your field while handles opponent's interactions. Because of that we have to use <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> and <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> in the deck to have access to these cards as soon as possible mostly sending Gokipole to the GY which becomes a Resonance Insect search for the hand or a Vanilla interrupt, but it also happens that sometimes you don't have extenders on hand to access the extra deck's Links and that way you add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> for the hand that becomes two bodies on the field.  Well, why did I just talk about Starters and mention Gokipole a lot (which isn't even a Normal Summon right and yes you want to send it to the gy somehow) but not <a data-name=""Scout Buggy"">Scout Buggy</a>? Because the Scout Buggy by itself doesn't help you deal with interactions because it's just a ""Tour Guide"" for itself but in the pure version of the deck it's a good starter and also the only efficient way to make <a data-name=""Cicada King"">Cicada King</a> besides mainly being an excellent follow up for the existence of Field Spell <a data-name=""Beetrooper Formation"">Beetrooper Formation</a> having a lot of use every turn in GY which improves the grind game that is the objective of this deck: take the opponent to the grind game and have a more advantageous exchange of resources. Other reasons why it is excellent in the pure version is because it is the second best option for a deck special with <a data-name=""Invincible Atlas"">Invincible Atlas</a> and that happens a lot.  About Sting Lancer, Scale Bomber and Beetrooper Spells/Traps used in the main deck: There was a time when I really liked using 3 <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> (because it's the best Beetrooper card in the game so far) but first I noticed that you never want to draw 2 copies in the starting hand becoming a brick, second in this format the number of hand traps that activate being discarded to gy decreased so it's very difficult for his effect to stay alive on turn 1, third that even with the high amount of cards good to return to the deck in this format thanks to <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> and his friend <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> the Sting Lancer is so easily accessible and recyclable that really 2 copies is the ideal number.  About <a data-name=""Scale Bomber"">Scale Bomber</a> I rarely take advantage of his interaction effect on the field but I keep maximizing it to 3 as he can chain block his Normal Summon but it sure is a card that can be reduced to 2 copies post side just like I do with Battlewasp's special summon extenders. About me not using <a data-name=""Assault Roller"">Assault Roller</a> I say that I never found the card good compared to Vanilla, although it can be an extender even if you have it in your hand the fact is that this deck has few ways to interact with the established field of opponent and Vanilla is one of the few options that the deck has access to destroy the opponent's cards and that's why I consider it a card 10 times better than the Assault Roller besides not needing to ban gy resources to enter the field. In short it is an extender and brick in the same way as Assault Roller but its cost-effectiveness is much better and rewarding, it is so necessary that whenever it is possible to return it to the deck you return it to make <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> an interaction/extender.  Why not use the <a data-name=""Heavy Beetrooper Mighty Neptune"">Heavy Beetrooper Mighty Neptune</a>? When the Spoiler from Beetrooper's supports were all known I saw him as the best among them all because he fixes the problem of banishing several Insects and not having to recycle them back to the deck but in practice it turned out to be a very bad card that brick every starting hand you see her and even in long grind game matches where you get 10 Banned Bugs I didn't miss him in the deck at all. So I currently consider it an unnecessary brick. In the future if the deck gets new support it may improve.  The spell <a data-name=""Beetrooper Descent"">Beetrooper Descent</a> has many advantages to be used but at the same time many disadvantages: The first advantage is that it is very beneficial to have 3 targets for the <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> to add to the hand throughout the game and this is very relevant. Second it makes the Sting Lancer two bodies on the field which is important when you are playing after suffering interruptions from the opponent. Third it is a spell/trap out when you have the <a data-name=""Invincible Atlas"">Invincible Atlas</a> on the field. But it brings many disadvantages that make the difference that is the case to create a token which does not become an Insect in GY to banish with <a data-name=""Armor Horn"">Armor Horn</a> and <a data-name=""Doom Dozer"">Doom Dozer</a> and this lack of resources makes you not able to continue playing or need to do so unoptimized plays and banish Bugs that shouldn't be banned, second that the destroy spell/trap effect doesn't prove as excellent against trap decks as it seems: often your opponent knows you added it with the Sting Lancer and throws around it activate <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> in Standby Phase to banish the Invincible Atlas and that way you can no longer destroy backrow and the worst thing is that it needs to first create the token and then destroy cards so it simply won't work on the <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> effect which is the worst Floodgate against the deck being a card that leaves a lot to be desired against trap match. To be honest cards like <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a>, <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> are much more important to win matches against Anti-meta and backrow decks because they have excellent floating effects if they let the field and trap deck destroy the opponent's monsters at all times to control the field.  About Extra Deck I have to comment that the existence of <a data-name=""Almiraj"">Almiraj</a> is one of the reasons why I don't maximize <a data-name=""Retaliating &quot;C&quot;"">Retaliating ""C""</a> because it simply cannot become an Almiraj and also because the search targets are the worst compared to the versatility of the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and the <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a>. Almiraj is also very important to play around cards like <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> besides being the way the deck can access <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> under the <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> effect since it is Cyberse and you can then summon from an Insect and make phoenix to pop the TCBO and keep playing after that so it's an essential card in this deck and its gy effect isn't hard to use either because like your Normal Summon bugs most trigger effects when destroyed by battle too so it's not It's unusual for you to go into the battle phase and destroy your own monsters like the Resonance Insect, Gokipole and Arbalest the Rapidfire that activate excellent floating effects.  <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect"">Shinobi Insect</a> is a card that should only be used because it is relevant that it is a Link-2 Insect made using two monsters with different names and also it is a free insect to be banned in the GY in place of other important insects, besides being a of the cards that help you play about the effect of <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> until you manage to destroy it. <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> is the extra deck flexible spot and I've already tested using the second <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillion"">Seraphim Papillion</a>, <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a> and <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> but in this format I've been facing a lot of decks that use <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> and I see Wind Pegasus as an excellent card to use against these strategies to make Winda with Schism. It's also not hard to make because of <a data-name=""Primitive Butterfly"">Primitive Butterfly</a> + <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> becoming an out for <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> so it has its uses in the deck. As I don't particularly do an aggressive endboard playing with this deck as most players go through with Counter Trap and Seraphim Papillion to reborn Sting the Poison on the opponent's turn I don't miss the second Seraphim Papillion but I confess it is very annoying having to shuffle him back to the extra deck every turn and the fear of seeing him banned from the gy by the opponent and not having access to him for the rest of the game but this risk I've been punished practically never until now and that's why I decide to keep keeping a versatility card like Wind Pegasus.  About the Side deck I usually don't make big changes from the main deck to the side deck because it's no use filling the deck with tech cards and not having plays after stopping the opponent so I think the side deck is balanced for the problems that the deck faces. <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> is essential when you go first with this deck because postside the opponent will have a lot of hate backrow like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> because you know you don't go through with monster interactions on the field, your interactions are all spell/trap zone and in your hand you will then receive a lot of side cards that Solemn Judgment denies.  On the DPE version that ranked second on the Remote Duel YCS Europe: This version of the deck focused on DPE Turbo makes sense because you trade the bad stuff in the deck, which is the scarcity of extra-deck monsters, to the Insect type. it makes it torture to play with the deck lock on Insects because you have nowhere to go and the win condition is very weak. So instead of lock-in on Insects why not choose to end up with a real win condition called <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>? That's the result. Not to mention that in this version you remove all the engine cards that don't help your deck play because one of the worst things about Beetrooper is the fact that you use a lot of one-offs that you never want to see in your hand because they are searchable and they are just part of your end board, they don't help the deck's resilience and that makes a difference in the deck's performance throughout a tournament. This deck's Bricks are very painful to buy but necessary to have a respectable grind game but the win condition is so weak that you don't even make the grind game most of the time, so this approach of focusing on passing with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer and cutting out all the bad vibes the deck uses makes perfect sense. The deck has Link Climb power, the engine is good but it is the DPE together with <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> that makes the deck viable and for sure this is a deck that has its days numbered because it is impossible to imagine that in the next banlist Verte Anaconda will continue in the game because it is the biggest problem of this format, the number of games I forgive is countless because of the existence of Verte Anaconda in the game. I don't think it's wrong that there are power spells that fuse the deck, I'm not mad at the guy activating Fusion Destiny but for sure he has the option to use Anaconda for that is unjustifiable. You have to choose to hold the best interaction of your deck like Counter Trap <a data-name=""Beetrooper Fly&amp;Sting"">Beetrooper Fly&amp;Sting</a> for Anaconda instead of the opponent's engine cards and this creates something very toxic in the game where the opponent is forcing your interactions just to be guaranteed be able to solve Verte Anaconda because it wins games for you and that has to end. That's why I think the pure version of Beetrooper will improve a lot with the banning of Verte Anaconda because the game is fairer where you can give interactions in the opponent's deck engine and not have to play around Verte Anaconda. The DPE version only exists because of this broken Link-2 that should have been banned a long time ago.  Combos about the deck I made available in this article and they are still valid because BODE supports haven't changed the way the deck plays: https://ygoprodeck.com/Forum/  and in the Article Discussion look for the topic: ""INTRODUCING THE BEETROOPER ARCHETYPE""  &nbsp;"

Heroes aren't the poster boys of fusion no more.,"Predaplants is a very hardcore fusion deck. They fuse as extenders and fuse as final board presence. You can go all fusion only and have the albaz fusion on but you can also do a mix of links, synchro and fusions. There are even options to side in more cards if you want.  When searching predaplant cards, search predapruning if you can first, then some of the effect monsters, and use the pendulum link to search the scale you are missing. I tend to have 5 searches each time.  Not fusion locked tips: Odd-eyes synchron is easy enough to use to make baronne after you fuse the scales to make a random fusion and get the scale 8 back in hand. I also like to have a preda counter on the link monster since it alters levels unless you want that and that way you can summon back the level one from grave.  Fusion locked tips: Cards that locks you under fusion; branded fusion and predapractice. Always send the level one predaplant with the branded fusion. Then of course there is the preda counter strategy that is pure fusion strategy really. There are 5 fusion cards and lots of ways to get materials.  My favorite searchable way to place counters is the trap predaplanning that can foolish the level one on your opponents turn for a search. I want to use necro fusion more but I do tend to have all my cards on board before needing it."

Aluber costs a lot, but if you are thinking of buying this deck he is essential to it, as he is like a Stratos. The main combo is Branded Fusion into Lubellion using Tragedy and Albaz, Albaz searches Branded in Red, then summoning Mirrorjade by Lubellion's effect. Using the Anaconda strat kinda works in the deck, but I have never really used it when I did use the deck. I added deployment just in case, but you can replace it with some handtraps, the same with lightning storm as that card is really expensive. The main weakness is negates and background removal, which is why I added Twin Twisters and Lightning Storm. But overall I've seen success with this deck."

The Deck uses Machine monsters primarily and Dragon monsters secondari","A <b>Cyberdark Deck</b> focuses on the use of machine cards, with dragon cards supporting. Making a proper build of this deck type requires good spell and trap cards that help fill up the graveyard quickly, so you can take advantage of discard cards like Tribute to the Doomed and Monster Reincarnation. Future Fusion and Foolish Burial are also effective for getting level 3 or lower dragons in the graveyard. Fusion monsters are used as auxiliary backup, being formed from, Cyberdark Impact!, Overload Fusion, and Dragon's Mirror they require that there be proper material monsters in the grave, making the use of them late game only, unless used in conjunction with Future Fusion. Virus cards can be used for addition advantage because Cyberdark monsters span the spectrum of their requirements. Synchro support comes in the form of level 7 and 6 monsters specifically Goyo Guardian, Dark Strike Fighter and Black Rose Dragon  Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, and Cyberdark Keel in addition to having equipping effects each have a unique addition damage ability that punishes defensive play by an opponent. Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, and Cyberdark Keel deliver piercing, direct, and burn damage respectively.  Cyberdarks are by themselves very weak monsters, with only 800 attack points, even a skilled duelist will get nervous using a deck like this, it has a lot of weaknesses, being near completely aggressive, relying on the grave to gain momentum, and weak against anti-monster spell/trap cards. Another looming threat is that the opponent turn this deck's graveyard against the duelist, like by using Monster Reborn on a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. A threat like this can be remedied by using dragons that are difficult to special summon like Yamata Dragon and Tyrant Dragon, or even dragons that cannot be special summoned from the graveyard like Diabolos, King of the Abyss, Light and Darkness Dragon, Armed Dragon LV10, Armed Dragon LV7, Dark Armed Dragon, Rainbow Dragon, or Rainbow Dark Dragon.  Ultimately, the high level dragon monsters used for Cyberdark Dragon in this deck comes down to the duelist's taste. If he or she wants to play it safe, then the aforementioned dragons can be used. If the duelist enjoys the Red-Eyes Black Dragon or Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards, they splash in very well. If the duelist wants to use a lot of Synchro Monster, then this deck can be easily geared towards powerful Synchro Dragons as well. Factors in deciding this depend on whether the deck is Dragon or Machine focused, and Fusion or Synchro focused.  The effects of the Cyberdarks only activate when they are Normal Summoned and cards such as Compulsory Evacuation Device, Pulling the Rug and Solemn Judgment will negate them. If a Cyberdark is in the graveyard, use Monster Reincarnation to discard a low level dragon and get the Cyberdark back in your hand and then re-summon it again and equip it with the dragon that was just discarded. Dark Eruption is a very good card for this deck too.  A nice little trick is to use Dark Armed Dragon or Light and Darkness Dragon to be equiped to Cyberdark Dragon. Both have 2800 attack which brings Cyberdark Dragon to 3800 not including the monsters in the grave. With Light and Darkness Dragon, when he's destroyed while being treated as an equip card, his second effect will still activate, wiping your field and summoning any monster from your grave. This can be useful if you just tributed your dragon for a virus, or if it was killed by a spell or trap such as Mirror Force."

Previous to this, every Fabled deck I have seen has pretty much been geared towards 'summon Cosmic Blazar Dragon and pass', this deck can do a lot more. By 'making Fableds playable' have I stuck in other archetypes and some floodgates? Absolutely! But theres genuine synergy here I swear and anytime cards are old enough not to include a 'once per turn' clause there's room for abusing that. </span>  <span>The goal of the deck is to climb into some of the biggest baddest synchros in the game (Baronne de Fleur has REALLY helped this, and it's great at summoning it) while drawing into some of your power cards (Dogmatikas, Nadir Servant especially) and floodgates (Vanity's Ruler, Imperial Order).</span>  <span>MAIN DECK</span>  <span>Rescue Cat, the Danger!s and the beast-type Fableds all aim to summon themselves as much as possible with an ideal combo of Hyper librarian -&gt; Fabled Ragin -&gt; Stardust Charge Warrior -&gt; Chaos Ruler -&gt; BdF netting you a tidy 7 draws, a 5 deep pseudo-search for a monster of your choosing and an omni-negate to boot. Grimro and Kushano help facilitate plays along with Double Summon, Monster Reborn, and Card Destruction to trigger some of your Fabled beasts effects. While risky given the number of decks that love to dump hand components into the grave it's necessary to kick off an otherwise dead hand and potentially gives you knowledge on how to adjust your end board. Stairway to a Fabled Realm is an in-archetype Foolish Burial with a second effect to discard in exchange for a Fabled in the grave. It's rare but it does sometimes come up. Pot of Avarice and TTT are for draw power. Double summon works wonders when you just can't reach the next stage of a combo and can be used to bring out Vanity's Ruler.</span>  <span>The Dogmatika cards are great going first or second and are super versatile being able to extend combos, add negates and OTK. I often find myself drawing nadir servant somewhere along my combo going first and can just set it until the end of my turn giving me Ecclesia on field and Fleurdelis in hand to add to whatever synchro threats I've been able to establish. Alternatively both Ecclesia and Fleurdelis can be used as synchro combo extenders with a Fleurdelis (or Ashiyan) + either of my lvl 2 Fabled tuners making BdF straight off the bat. I know Ashiyan doesn't feature in every Dogmatika deck but given all the synchro climbing he often gets a chance to summon and can fetch a Fleurdelis or Ecclesia that's fallen foul of a Danger! or Card Destruction.</span>  <span>Imperm is great going first and second and very few decks like to play through Imperial Order. Side deck is still a work in progress but Royal Decree is devastating against the decks that don't care about IO and as a 3 of, this deck can almost garuntee working its way through to a copy .</span>  <span>EXTRA DECK</span>  <span>Titaniklad and Nt'ss are standard Nadir fodder.</span>  <span>Hyper Librarian, Ragin and Stardust Charge Warrior are draw power early combo. Dawn Dragster, Crystal Wing, Archfiend Abyss and BdF are negates to build a board with. Chaos Ruler is truly an MVP of the deck. The 5 deep dig will almost always pick you up the missing Vanity's Ruler, Ecclesia or Fabled you need to extend the combo with. On top of that you can Synchro it away to make Archfiend Abyss or BdF and then bring it back to make the other should you have another tuner.</span>  <span>Gossip Shadow gives you at least some form of protection on the odd time when you don't draw a tuner and enables Dogmatika plays.</span>  <span>Halqifibrax helps with link plays, the Knightmares deal with problematic threats while also enabling a sometimes essential discard and Zeroboros is a boardwipe. With Fleurdelis you can even trigger this on your opponents turn should you fancy it. </span>  <span>SUMMARY</span>  <span>It's not going to take the meta by storm, but the Fabled monsters form the core of what is a surprisingly versatile and adaptive deck that can be a real headache for a lot of other decks to get round. I've not seen anyone else play anything quite like this. Perhaps because it is DIFFICULT and there are some cards that will fundamentally just stop it in its tracks but the result is far more effective than I had hoped for when I started out. Open to any and all feedback and constructive criticism.</span>  &nbsp;"

Tips: -You cannot use Transcode Talkers effect because it locks you into Cyberse monsters for the rest of the turn which means you cannot summon the Levianeer or the catapult turtle.  -The Link Ratings that you banish off of the 2nd effect of Clock Dragon must equal EXACTLY the amount of cards that you have left in deck. If the link ratings are too high you cannot activate the Cyberse Clock Dragon's effect.  -You must search the Clock Wyvern off of Codec when you summon Excode Talker  -You can use Firewall Dragon to return extenders to your hand. Most of the time you want to bounce the Clock Wyvern after using it to extend.  -There is too much to explain so im gonna give up here  &nbsp;

Classic starter for this engine is Creation Venus into triple shine, link spider &amp; imduk off the shines into 4 mat Saryuja.  If you don't open with this &amp; have Diviner of the Heralds in your opener, you can use Diviner to dunk Trias Hierarchia, tribute Diviner for Trias &amp; summon Buten from deck to synchro into Master Flare Hyperion (MFH). From there you give Hyperion Creation Venus' effect &amp; ladder to saryuja.  Extensions (1):  After Saryuja's summoned, you can use its effect to special summon Diviner from hand if you haven't used it already. Use same combo as before to pull MFH. Once you get this synchro out, you can use its effect to get Destruction Venus' effect &amp; pull the shine balls from grave. These can be used to Link into Moon (&amp; leaves 1 for effect cost if you're going 2nd or they summon on your turn), or you can banish Buten from grave &amp; synchro for Jiujiu.  Alternatively, if you don't have Diviner in hand or have already used one &amp; have Jet Synchron in hand, Saryuja can be used to special summon Jet &amp; then used as fodder for Linkross, letting you setup into Martial Metal Marcher (MMM). MMM can be used to pull Jet from grave, and Jet &amp; Linkross can be used for Halq, which can pull a DVenus on summon. This lets you summon Hyper Librarian with your remaining Linkross tokens &amp; pull Jet back to field. (MMM MUST be before Hyper Librarian in this route or else you can't summon Jet with MMM)  Route above can also deviate to Celestial Double Star Shaman (CDSS) instead of Halq, allowing you to pull out 2 shine balls from grave, which can line up for a Hyper Librarian with CDSS/Shine/token, or straight up to a level 8. Going into Borreload Savage nets you a 4 turn omni-negate, while Chaos Ruler grabs a 5 card excavation draw.  If you have a Destruction Venus in hand, you can pull it with Saryuja, pull shine balls from grave, &amp; synchro for Hyper Librarian (if you have other tuners to summon), or straight up to Crocodragon to draw 3 with on its summon &amp; setup QE destruction. DVenus in hand can also perform the same combo as the first part of this section, and leaves some room open for Diviner later on. On CVenus start, this can net you +2 in hand if you summon Crocodragon, with 4 total draw in the combo, 1 of which is a 4 card excavation. Slightly better hand advantage at the end, and keeps Diviner open, but can struggle a bit with extending further.  Avarice can pull back nearly the entire combo to make Saryuja (5/6 cards), so if you have this &amp; another Creation Venus in hand, you can pull the Shine Balls &amp; Link-1's &amp; special summon Creation Venus with Saryuja to start up another draw cycle. If you started with 2 CVenus &amp; Avarice in hand, this line gives you +1 w/ 4 draws throughout the combo, 2 of which are 4 card excavations. Monster reborn can substitute for a 2nd venus in this line &amp; keeps your saryuja's special summon free for something else.  Extensions (2):  Things get a bit tricker at this phase, as the board starts to clutter up &amp; available effects become few &amp; far between. This is also the parts of the solitaire game where my memory on what to do gets a bit muddled, if you've reached this stage you probably know what's up  If by some chance you haven't used Diviner yet, pull it out, then do the whole MFH schtick. Shine balls at this point can almost only be used for a Moon, or turned into tuners by Buten to get Jiujiu out, who gets a targeted non-destruct removal &amp; is well protected. Jiujiu can help declutter if desired, or if going second, just send away something you don't like. There's sometimes opportunities to convert Jiujiu into a level 8, but I can't remember the exact routes at the moment.  For the Route in E1 that ends in MMM &amp; Hyper Librarian, the best (maybe only way) to continue off of it is to have a Neptune in hand to sac for a DVenus in hand (or that somehow ended up in grave). Yada yada, Shiny Orb time, do some bs &amp; pop off however the hell you want. Summon a level 8, or if you're desperate for cards, Buten a Shine Ball &amp; synchro for Crocodragon for 2 new cards in hand.  If hyper librarian lands on board, don't worry too much about getting a bunch of cards off of it, it'll pretty often net you a card or 2, but can be safely used for synchro fodder if need be.  Ending:  Good place to be is generally with either/both L8 synchros &amp; Majesty Hyperion on board. Often Saryuja will be awkard to get rid of, so they'll buff anything you put in their linked zones.  With the amount of draw available in this deck, you're pretty damn likely to have Ecclesia or your other Dogmatikas in hand. If you pull Fleurdelis with Ecclesia on Turn 1, save it for turn 2 to negate an opponent's on board monster. If you're confident that an opponent needs their extra deck pieces (like this deck does), you can pull Dragma instead &amp; toss any ED leftovers. At this point anything left in the extra deck won't have much use aside from this (Avarice can also help recycle some stuff for Dragma).  Handtraps/Miscellaneous:  Herald of Orange Light is your protection against setups when you play turn 2 (Crystal Wing, Borreload Savage, etc.).  Called By is handtrap to handtrap negation, handtrap to handtrap communication. Don't use if opponent is just trying to ash blossom CVenus, since all it does is make you waste an extra 500 LP, and none of the combos require ALL your LP.  Dragged Down takes your opponent's hand and slaps Nibiru out of it. Be sure to not use this before you put your starter down though, as they discard from your hand too. (probably after 2nd or 3rd summon is the time to use this. 4th if you want to watch the life drain from your opponent's eyes)  Sacred Water of the Sky can pull a Neptune to your hand, which can sit as a combo extender, or wait til after you've activated Lost Sanctuary, so you can summon Majesty Hyperion on your opponent's turn  Genex Ally Birdman can bounce a Shine Ball summoned by CVenus for its summon, then CVenus can pull the Shine back and you can pull straight to a level 8 or 9. Don't recommend this unless it's your 2nd run of using CVenus' effect.  Arcana EX Light can summon off of Venus' Shine Balls &amp; potentially setup a spell/trap negate that can brick up to 4 cards. On the other side of this, it can become a heavy offensive threat, and return cards from grave to hand. Should be emphasized that this should be used to FINISH the main phase, as the spell/trap negation is involuntary and can stop some plays.  What does Pot of Greed do again?  Good luck with this deck, it's not too hard to get the hang of once you've started it, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed by how many cards end up in play."

The Synchro Monsters of the Ice Barrier break free in Structure Deck: Freezing Chains!  Originating in the very first Hidden Arsenal, the Ice Barrier strategy puts the freeze on opposing strategies while preparing to finish them off with their incredible Synchro Monsters! “Ice Barrier” monsters work as a team to suppress your opponent’s actions. There are “Ice Barrier” monsters that weaken opposing monsters, prevent your opponent from Tribute Summoning, delay the activation of Spell Cards, prevent attacks, and more, but only if you control a second “Ice Barrier” monster. If that second monster also has a similar suppression effect, you’ll get both effects!  The most famous “Ice Barrier” monster of all, Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier, returns in a new, even more destructive form in Structure Deck: Freezing Chains! Not only does this new Synchro Monster banish up to 3 cards your opponent controls, it also Summons the original Trishula if your opponent destroys it! This new Trishula can find a home in any strategy that can use Synchro Monsters, so don’t miss your chance to add this powerful monster to your Extra Deck.  Structure Deck: Freezing Chains includes all of the “Ice Barrier” Synchro Monsters as part of its 5-card Extra Deck."

DPE and Metalfoes, real straight forward","With DPE being one of the best boss monsters of this format, it's no surprise that he fits very well into FA Metalfoes a deck that has great synergy with destroying their own cards for searching and card advantage. This deck runs DPE as well as the basic Halifibrax combo that can end on 3 negates quite easily, you could also consider DPE as a backup strategy for when your main combo line gets disrupted. Other options for the deck include the artifact scythe lock with Dagda as any deck running DPE with a decent extra deck spam engine can consider Dagda.  The main combo line will start with trying to get two monsters, one being a tuner, to try and get out Halqifibrax, from here you simply summon the Deskbot 001 from the deck, link 3 into Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon get 3 tokens, summon the Deckbot 001 from grave with its effect, synchro 4 for a Quandax, use Auroradon's effect to tribute two tokens and summon a Phantom Beast from the deck, get Coltwing, summon the two tokens, and then synchro into Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage. At this point, there are a bunch of extenders you could try going for, but you'll likely end with a Herald of the Arclight or a Baronne de Fleur/Ruddy Rose. IT may seem like a lot but it's pretty straightforward once you get a hang of it.  This combo is quite fragile and can be disrupted fairly easily by a lot of decks so you'll be a victim of games that feel like you lose at the coin flip but you have many options for going second. The deck works well with droplets as there are quite a good amount of cards that you'd like to be in the graveyard. And Dark Ruler no more is basically an auto-include since you can't really combo into most meta boards. If all that fails trying for a one synchro board plus gravity collapse does work quite well as shutting your opponent out of summons for the rest of the turn on a spell speed 3 is, as expected, really good."

Targets for negate are Invoked and utopia double. If i sp summon Ascended/Armed sage and normal summon Alisteir and the opponent negate the eff of Alisteir then i summon utopia double, the opponent use negate eff again but i chain with utopia double. If i used Ascended sage then i summon number 39, after c39 and then dragner. If i used Armed sage then i summon dragner or directly utopia leo ray (most of the times directly leo ray) if the opponent use negate effect for 3rd time in same turn then i can summon utopia lightning or wait the perfect moment (maybe bp) in his turn (utopia double quick eff) to summon utopia dragonik (5000atk), if the opponent target dragonik with card eff or for attack i can use the quick eff  to equip ZW monster from hand or deck (pegasus/tornado) - until the summoning of dragonik the opponent used 3 cards (negates) so he have 3 cards in his hand, he can't destroy dragonik by batle (almost impossible) so he need to target it by a card eff, with these 3 cards in hand will be very hard for him (absurd), keep in mind also that the summoning of dragonik was done by utopia double which is quick eff so i can chain in case he use something , dragonik is also quick eff. If there is no negates and he use just nibiro against me, after nibiro resolves i can summon Mechaba. So i will have mechaba and token with crazy atk. This strategy can work against the most common cards such as veiller, impermanence, nibiro, etc...  With onomatopaira and Ascended/Armed sage i can end on board: -If he use 1 negate against me then my board will be with ascended sage: dragner ,leo utopia ray, abyss dweller and in his turn i will summon number 22 or 41. -if he use 2 negates then my board is: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if he use 3 negates: my board: utopia double + Zubababancho and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik (i can use the eff of bancho the next turn if he is still alive also). -if i used armed sage instead ascended sage, for 1 negate: dragner (i prefer to summon directly leo but i mention it because u can summon both dragner and leo), leo utopia ray, abyss dweller . -for 2 negates: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -for 3 negates: utopia double + Zubababancho (i can use the eff the next turn) and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if i want to play safe and avoid nibiro i will just summon Ascended/Armed sage + Utopic Onomatopoeia and then utopia double and then directly utopia leo ray  and the next turn i will have follow ups in my hand.  I have 2 cards in my extra deck for some situations and a backup plan. Number 101: if i am in bad position and i need to clear the field but the opponent is with monster 3000atk+ then i use number 101, i attack and i use the eff to stay alive, then i summon Zeus and i clear the field. Number 101 is helpful in many situations. Utopia the Lightning: i usually summon that card only when i think dragonik is not needed and after 3 or more negates against me, it's helpful in other situations too.  BRICKS SOLUTIONS: -If u draw the spell double or nothing u can go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado. -If u draw pegasus, use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects. -If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand. -Note: if u are second, in every case try to attack with number 39 (+ double or nothing) and win the duel.  Important note: -in case the opponent try to use negate against u or other, u are able to chain with utopia double because of the activated eff of armed/ascended sage, keep it in mind. -if u use Armed sage, then go directly from utopia double to leo utopia ray (my reccomendation). -if u use armed + ascended sage together for utopia double, be careful which eff u activate first , be smart -Astral Kuriboh is needed in this deck as extra card combo for invoked and onomatopaira, beside Ascended/Armed sage. -You can win a duel with one attack. Combo with utopia double = number 39 = double or nothing. Be smart... -Leo utopia ray eff for negate and halving atk is forever, same goes for Dragonik.  -The deck is good going first/second also. -If u going first u have chance to open Aleister, Meltdown, Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup: 85% + pots = 92%. -If u going first u have chance to open Astral kuriboh, Ascended/Armed sage: 82% +pots = 90% -if u going second and the opponent have a very strong board, u can destroy that board by forbiden dropplet + dark ruler and u can give him a hard time with Forbidden Chalice: 71% chance to open + pots = 85%  This is my updated version, stronger than the previous one (the previous one was with dogmatika which was also good but if the opponent used negate eff then i would end on weak board, that's the reason for this currently update)  P.s. i updated this post few times, last update 31/12/2021."

There's now a lot of combinations of The Weather cards (I'll go over them in detail later) that can summon Rainbow in a single turn with an omni-negate ready.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>When this card resolves, you can place 1 “The Weather” Spell/Trap from your Deck face-up in your Spell/Trap Zone.</span></li>  	<li><span>You can only use each of the following effects of this card once per turn.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you would Link Summon a “The Weather” Link Monster, you can also use face-up “The Weather” Spell/Trap cards in your Spell/Trap Zones as Link material, by treating them as “The Weather” Monsters.</span></li>  	<li><span>During the Main Phase, you can: Immediately after this effect resolves, Normal Summon 1 “The Weather” Monster.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>You can only activate this card once per turn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Changes in deck building</span>  <span>Before the deck was very, very slow. Snowy and Rainbowed Canvas would slowly gain you advantage until you could summon Rainbow and outgrind your opponent from there. Since all of your omni negates float back there's pretty much infinite grind. If a deck can't beat 3 omni negates a turn it can't beat this deck after setting up, that simple. But getting there took a while so people had to rely on floodgates like <span><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a></span> to surive since all of your Weather Painters ""dodge"" the negate. They have great synergy with <span><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a></span> since they remove themselves from the field, leaving your field empty so that Torrential only hurts your opponent and that Gamma can be activated during their turn still.</span>  <span>But the deck's tempo increased tenfold. You are now ending on your Link-3 turn 1, turning off Lose 1 Turn. Skill Drain negates Rainbow's effect to turn your other painters into little and adorable boss monsters. Both of these floodgates lose their strength and space in this deck. This creates not only a purer deck but also a deck that's more fun to play against (objectively speaking). If possible you like to keep Rainbow on the field so Torrential Tribute's much weaker in this deck, too. I kept it in for reason I'll go into later. I opted to keep Gamma in too, since it still has it's uses setting up the board and is strong going second. One brick is only half the bricks every other deck plays nowadays.</span><span> Wow Konami really put Skill Drain to three, huh. That does change things a wee bit. This deck is way faster and a good hand can turbo out Rainbow with a negate turn one but having 6 floodgates that turn off effects is crazy strong and it'd be a shame if this deck wouldn't make use of that. The glue that makes both Skill Drain and Rainbow work together so well is <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff9900;&quot;&gt;The Weather Painter Thunder&lt;/span&gt;""><span>The Weather Painter Thunder</span></a>. It sends both Skill Drain and Lose 1 Turn for cost, meaning its effect will resolve and you can out your own floodgate whenever YOU wish for it. Every card in this archetype is hyper accessible so getting to Thunder isn't a problem. So you either draw into the floodgates and can summon Rainbow once you have multiple Painters for negates to show for it or, if you don't draw into the floodgates summon her turn one, which is highly likely that you can do that, given that you didn't draw any of your six floodgates.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The combos and strategies</span>  <span>The main pieces of your combo are</span> <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow,""><span>The Weather Painter Snow</span><span>,</span></a> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a></span> <span>and</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Forecast"">The Weather Forecast</a></span>.  <span>How to set-up Rainbow + 1 ""The Weather"" monster (during your opponent's SP):</span> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Painter Snow + 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster OR Spell Canvas OR Forecast:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>NS Snow, activate effect to add Snowy Canvas <span>// other Spell Canvas if Snowy is drawn</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Snowy, banish Snow using Snowy's effect to add Forecast <span>// other Spell Canvas if Forecast is drawn</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating a Canvas from deck <span>// I prefer Thundery since it's very niche and I run two</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast to NS a Weather Painter from hand OR activate a Spell Canvas from hand</span></li>  	<li><span>link off Weather Painter and Canvases for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Snow during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Forecast + 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating Snowy Canvas from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>NS a The Weather monster</span></li>  	<li><span>Banish it using Snowy's effect to add Snow</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast to NS Snow</span></li>  	<li><span>Snow effect to activate a Canvas from deck <span>// this is where I go for Thundery</span></span></li>  	<li><span>link off Snow, Snowy and the third Canvas for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Weather Painter during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Snowy Canvas + 2 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monsters OR 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster &amp; Spell Canvas other than Snowy OR Snowy Canvas and The Weather Painter Thunder:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Snowy Canvas <span>// activate Snowy first in case opponent uses imperm/veiler on your monster</span></span></li>  	<li><span>NS a Weather Painter</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you opened Thunder and another Snowy Canvas: Use Thunder's effect here, sending Snowy for a different Canvas and then activate the second Snowy from hand</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Banish it using Snowy's effect to add Forecast</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating a Canvas from deck <span>// still prefer Thundery</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Now either..</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, NS second Weather Painter <span>// if you've drawn two Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monsters</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Spell Canvas other than Snowy <span>// if you've drawn one Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster and a Spell Canvas other than Snowy</span></span></li>  	<li><span>go to the next step if you've drawn Thunder and two Snowy since you already have 3 Canvases face-up</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>link off Weather Painter and Canvases for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li>A<span>ctivate Weather Painter during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span>The Weather Painter Cloud is fantastic follow-up since it brings back two Canvases from the GY. Before they stayed on the field unless your opponent destroyed them but now that they are used as link materials playing a second copy of Cloud makes sense.</span>  <span>Thanks to Rainbowed Canvas you can slowly summon more and more Weather Painters. Once you have enough Weather Painters and Canvases set up you can use them to summon</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Moon"">The Weather Painter Moon</a></span> <span>to link climb into</span> <span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span> <span>while still having 1 or 2 Weather Painters linked to Rainbow for protection.</span>  <span>While the first turn setup consists of only one omni-negate and a summon negate (only if you must!), it's much better than before and quickly gains tempo on your following turn. Generic Trap Cards help maintain your first turn board.</span>  <span>If you open Torrential Tribute you can end on Moonbow + 1 Weather Painter pointed to it. A banish followed up with a board wipe is be better than a single omni-negate and Moonbow floats into Rainbow, enabling your negates during your turn. Your Weather Painter comes back before your opponent's monster banished through Moonbow, too.</span>  <span>Don't underastimate</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a></span><span>. The ideal endboard doesn't rely on Auroral for interruption but if you can't get to that Auroral still provides a good threat against combo decks that rely on specific cards. Worst case it's link fodder.</span>  <span>For Spell Canvasas the only one besides Snowy I consider worth it to run is <span><a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas</a></span>. It bounces your opponnt's S/T cards. While it doesn't negate it's strong against Field Spells and Continous Spells/Traps and to bounce Trap Cards during the EP. Technically works against Equip Spells too but when was the last time you saw a HOPT on one of these.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a></span> <span>is for consistency.</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></span> <span>or</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></span> <span>can easily be played since the ED is very flexible. I think Extravagance is better in this deck than Prosperity. Extravagance should not be run with Piri Reis Map.</span>  <span>The Solemn traps are both strong offensively and defensively. IDP is strong too and doesn't look your like Dogmatika Punishment would. Punishment is therefore no longer a bugdet alternative. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Control, Midrange or Combo?</span>  I had to change this last section which was originally about running this as a combo deck, oriented on summoning Rainbow turn one as consistent as possible with handtraps instead of floodgates. With Skill Drain at three I don't think that's worth an idea anymore. Midrange is a loose term in yugioh but it sits kind of right between the other two. While control doesn't perform that many actions and control performs a whole lot of them, midrange are usually decks that have short combos and both elements of control and combo. This mostly resembles a control deck, yet it can be very explosive very early in the game. In this build I'm on a few handtraps to stop my opponent. Besides Gamma, which is definitely a must have, Imperm and Droll could both be switched out for control-oriented cards like Solemns or IDP. I don't think either choice is bad and it's not like I can go to locals and test it out. After all the release is still a few month away. I'm constently going back and forth and I do like the idea of Gamma and Imperm but I might switch out Droll for Solemn Strike or something like that, idk. Anyways I think this is going to be a fun deck to play. While floodgates are usually kind of stale the archetype has a fun gimmick, interesting cards and two really cool boss monsters and I'm looking forward to trying this out IRL."

Now that I've seen that the deck cost roughly $1200 at the time of writing this, I've decided to cut the expensive staples and make the deck cheaper (because let's be honest, if you're willing to spend that much money on cardboard, you may as well get a meta deck).  To start off, the single-greatest card ever printed (in my opinion), Darklord Nurse Reficule. This is your win condition (alongside Bad Reaction to Simochi), and as such the deck is designed to get this card out as quickly as possible or die trying. Banishment of the Darklords is extremely useful as it just simply adds 3 more copies of nurse to the deck. If this still isn't enough, 5 more consistency cards are included in Pot of Duality, Card of Demise, and Upstart Goblin.  Onto the burn cards, and the entire reason why you will win and lose games depending on how long Nurse and Simochi remain face-up. Gift Card and The Paths of Destiny are the best burn cards you have access to as, with Nurse or Simochi on board, they deal a flat 3000 or 2000 respectively to your opponent. The big-brained among you may have figured out that 3 Gift Card or 2 Gift Card and a Paths of Destiny will kill your opponent flat-out. That fact is why I included 2 Trap Trick in the list. Pretty straightforward. The less-than-straighforward burn cards are Dark Cure and Tri-and-Guess. Dark Cure is this deck's version of Maxx ""C"", as it can scare the opponent into making a much weaker board than they otherwise would have. It's not amazing though since it's entirely reliant on your opponent's gameplan, much like the other listed card, Tri-and-Guess. Now, since the extra deck with this list only has Link monsters, you just have to use that massive noggin of yours to figure out what kind of deck your opponent is playing and hope that it works. This of course falls apart if your opponent is on a Link-only extra deck, but hey that's what game 2 is for.  And now for the remaining garbage in the main deck. Condemned Witch is a really cool card since it can search one of the ""Forbidden"" quick-play spells. The last version of this list used Forbidden Droplet as the search target, but unless you already have copies of that card, Forbidden Chalice is the next-best choice. Witch also serves as another way to drop Nurse on the field, so we're now up to 9 copies of Nurse in the deck. Just Desserts is the easiest way for this deck to clean up a game. It's another card that's reliant on your opponent's field, but I think any deck other than Mystic Mine burn is gonna have at least a single monster on board for you to get value from. Dark Bribe is just the cheapest counter trap I could find that actually worked well with this deck. Solemn Judgment is always going to be better, but it's also always going to be more expensive.  The extra deck is just the cheapest set of Link monsters I could find that also technically benefit the deck. Just replace them with whatever half-decent links you have in your bulk because let's face it, you're never going into the extra deck with Nurse Burn.  The side deck is super variable as it all depends on matchups you might come across. If you have a friend who plays Jinzo, you're gonna need a card like Santa Claws or Raigeki to get rid of it. If you keep getting ruined by Imperial Order, use Heavy Storm Duster. If you're going second and want a cool way to remove a problem extra deck boss, use Psychic Eraser Laser for non-targeting, non-destruction removal with burn attached to it. Yes, this card outs Dragoon. I'm shocked as well.  As for other options, you can fix the deck by using more expensive cards that you actually own. Like adding Extrav or Prosperity to boost the consistency of the deck, or cosmic cyclone/lightning storm to clear problem backrow. Just don't buy those cards to use in fucking Nurse Burn"

Boss monsters are the Beetroopers which are all relatively easy to make in the deck (but usually at the cost of banishing resources from your GY) with Invincible Atlas opening up zones to put Deus-X-Krawler with Mind Meld while being beefy and hard to get rid of outside of non-targeting non destructive removal or battle in turn basically locking down the field while you go do your creepy Krawly things. Ballista can recycle whatever you banish for the Beetroopers when she dies and just get one heavy hit in with her debuff (making the Battlewasp an honorary Bee(trooper) *wink*)  Of course you can imagine the strategy is far from meta but as a huge Insect fan I just had to try to mesh them. If I used even more deck slots I probably also would've thrown in Battlewasps but they aren't valid materials for at least 2 of the Krawler link monsters so I decided against them for now (except for Big Ballista who's there to give the deck even more colour and possibly recycle stuff we used for the Troopers)

From there, you can negate every monster effect that your opponent wants to use and beat over huge monsters.  The combo can sometimes need to be changed a bit depending on your opponent's board. For example, If they control no effect monsters then you should go into a different monster than Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara. If they haven't banished any cards, then go into Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing for an optional card draw at the cost of your next draw phase.  This is not a beginner-friendly deck and it takes a lot of time to get good with it but if you do it's very rewarding. I personally think that I have at least 100 hours playing this deck on Yugiohpro so I think I might have a slight addiction to this deck."

Nimble Beaver and Obedience Schooled are both used get Xyz creatures out quickly, great as an opener or for recovering from mass destruction.  Alpha is pretty easy to special summon in this deck, while Behemoth can essentially be summoned for free if you sacrifice a Melffy or two, return it to hand, and then re-summon it at the end of the round.  Kalantosa is actually the main form of removal in the deck. Search for it with Melffy Puppy or play it from hand with Melffy Fenny to destroy something.  Melffy Hide and Seek protects against destruction and allows us to run Torrential Tribute as a trap version of Raigeki while it's active, and can also be used to keep our creatures from Obedience Schooled... although I really don't know if that's all that useful, given our creature's average sizes. As a bonus, card draw's nice once in a while, too.  Pinpoint Landing is free draw and/or removal bait with any Melffy.  Solidarity's pretty decent in an all-Beasts deck, and three copies can work together, so we might as well run all of them.  Xyz Tribalrivals and Melffy's Playhouse are protection for the extra deck and removal, wrapped up in a neat little package.  Xyz Revival Splash and Monster Reborn are both just handy tools for recursion.  Last but not least for the main deck, Closed Forest adds some slight damage boosts to our beasties, and can lock out Field Spells for the opponent.  As for the extras, Melffy Mommy will be the main hitter, with Ronin Raccoon as a good second choice, while Cat Shark and Joyous Melffys are great support."

Here are some tips to that help with very basic plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>Tips</strong> <ul>  	<li>Your combo should start off with going into either Chaos Ruler, Minerva, or Dominion to mill as many cards as possible. This will allow to get everything in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>You send Imperial Order from the deck to the graveyard with the effect of Dominion, then go into Knightmare Gryphon to set imperial order from the graveyard to your side of the field.</li>  	<li>When you banish 3 light monsters to summon Chaos Dragon Levianeer, also banish Chaos Valkyrie too. Activate Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 and Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2. Since chain links resolve backwards, use Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2 to send Archlord Kristya from the deck to the graveyard, then use Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 to special summon Archlord Kristya from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Crackdown and royal decree were sided so they can be used to be sent to the graveyard by either milling or Dominion and set from the graveyard with Gryphon. Other cards like Summon Limit can be used sided as well for the purpose of the Dominion/Gryphon combo.</li> </ul>"

For example, many ""Ice Barrier"" monsters have effects to protect other ""Ice Barrier"" monsters, be it from attacks (""<a title=""Cryomancer of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Cryomancer_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Cryomancer of the Ice Barrier</a>"" forbids all monsters of Level 4 or higher from attacking while its owner control another ""Ice Barrier"") or card effects (""<a title=""Dai-sojo of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dai-sojo_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Dai-sojo of the Ice Barrier</a>"" protects all of your ""Ice Barriers"" from being destroyed by Spell/Trap Cards). These effects can overlap, making ""Ice Barriers"" capable of creating resilient fields if several of their monsters are out. One of the three Generals of the Ice Barrier, ""<a title=""General Raiho of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Raiho_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Raiho</a>"", does not need other ""Ice Barrier"" monsters for its effect to work, but it can stand on its own as well as complement their lockdowns by taking a toll on the opponent's hand if they rely on monster effects.  Many of the ""Ice Barrier"" monsters are not very useful if alone, making this archetype have issues if not able to establish field presence. While not plentiful, Ice Barriers do have effects of their own to facilitate having several monsters out, such as ""<a title=""Magic Triangle of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Triangle_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Magic Triangle of the Ice Barrier</a>"", and this is also assisted by the effects of their remaining two Generals, ""<a title=""General Grunard of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Grunard_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Grunard</a>"" and ""<a title=""General Gantala of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Gantala_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Gantala</a>"".  The aforementional ""General Gantala of the Ice Barrier"" is one of the archetype's trump cards, being a 2700 ATK monster that can Special Summon an ""Ice Barrier"" monster from its controller's <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">Graveyard</a> during each of their turns' <a title=""End Phase"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/End_Phase"">End Phase</a>.

Specific monsters can be discarded by using ""Strategist"" in conjuction with ""<a title=""Medallion of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Medallion_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Medallion of the Ice Barrier</a>"", making revival effects such as ""<a title=""Call of the Haunted"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" and ""<a title=""Back to the Front"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Back_to_the_Front"">Back to the Front</a>"" viable options to build fields. ""Medallion"" can also be used to gather enough different names for the activation of ""Magic Triangle"".  ""<a title=""Prior of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Prior_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Prior of the Ice Barrier</a>"" is a multi-purpose card - it can be used for its easy Special Summon, quickly enabling another ""Ice Barrier"" monster's effect, or be used for its effect to Special Summon any other ""Ice Barrier"" monster from the Graveyard - the usual target being ""Gantala"", as it can in turn revive more ""Ice Barriers"" turn after turn, but it can revive other monsters for Synchro and Xyz Summons as well. ""Prior"" himself can be easily retrieved by ""<a title=""Salvage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" and ""<a title=""Surface"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Surface"">Surface</a>"", making it possible to use a single copy of ""Prior"" several times.  For the most part, ""Ice Barriers"" want to establish a solid field and, if possible, keep it. While they are definitely capable of Synchro Summoning with their own <a title=""Tuner monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Tuner_monster"">Tuner monsters</a>, and all of their <a title=""Synchro Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Synchro_Monster"">Synchro Monsters</a> are very good, caution must be exercised - their Tuners themselves have defensive effects you must give up on in order to Synchro Summon, and ""Ice Barriers"" as a whole are not very good at gaining and keeping card advantage.  Due to the archetype's lack of draw power, you can use cards like ""<a title=""Shard of Greed"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shard_of_Greed"">Shard of Greed</a>"" and ""<a title=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Maxx_%22C%22"">Maxx ""C""</a>"".  ""<a title=""Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dewloren,_Tiger_King_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier</a>"" and its ability to return face-up cards to the hand make it possible for players to dedicate a build to it and use a variety of Spell/Trap Cards that remain on the field such as ""<a title=""Swords of Revealing Light"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Swords_of_Revealing_Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>"" to pressure the opponent while you can replay them constantly as long as ""Dewloren"" is around. The many means of revival the ""Ice Barrier"" archetype has makes it difficult to break through ""Dewloren"" combos permanently without banishing it or returning it to the Extra Deck."

I felt like making a deck that doesn't use Halqifibrax. Is that less optimal? Maybe. But hey, I like this version, even if it bricks sometimes. Feel free to make any changes you see fit, since in my experiences this deck can brick sometimes, and its grind game is subpar at best. EXTREMELY fun to use, however.  The idea here is to stop your opponent from gaining momentum. I try to get a normal monster on the board and the funny gun in my hand ASAP so I can make some plays. The archetype's Rituals are highly recommended, but the deck can function without them. The Side Deck just lists some alternatives you can run.  Suggestions and feedback are greatly appreciated!  &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Here's the details:</strong>  <span><strong>The Core</strong></span>  <strong>Normal monsters:</strong> These should be level 4 and I like to have as much attribute diversity as possible. 2 Megalosmashers are present because of the dino Xyz monsters. Overall, run one of each (save for light because Mafteal) and I have Clavkiys at 3 because it's a name in the archetype.  <strong>Maginificent Magikey Mafteal (x3): </strong>One of the main playmakers of the deck, you run no less than 3 of these. It revives a normal monster on summon and gives you an extra normal summon if you control a Magikey while it's in your hand.  <strong>Magikey World (x3): </strong>This is one of the most important cards in the deck. It searches a Magikey on activation and can search the funny gun once per turn. It also protects normal monsters from destruction once a turn. I'd run four of these if I could, that's how important this card is.  <strong>Magikey Maftea (x3):</strong> Speaking of funny gun, here it is. If you control a normal monster, you can use one in the deck for a fusion or ritual summon, which is EXTREMELY helpful.  <strong>Magikey Battle</strong> <strong>(x1): </strong>Good protection for your Magikeys, sadly it only protects them from whatever you chain it to, as well as being once per turn. This is one of the targets for Transfurlmine (the magikey synchro).  <strong>Magikey Unlocking (x2): </strong>Something neat about this card is that after negating a Spell/Trap, it changes your opponent's monsters' attribute on the field to one of your choice, INCLUDING those they have yet to summon. For example, if your opponent wanted to summon Wee Witch's Apprentice, which needs 2 dark monsters. If they use a spell/trap at the start of their turn, you can use Unlocking to negate that and declare something like light. Now, any monster they summon is now a light monster for the turn, so they can't summon Apprentice.  <strong>Magikey Mechmusket - Batosbuster (x2): </strong>Searches ANY Magikey card on summon, so it's very good for that and getting monsters in the grave. It's also a Tuner, so you can use it for Synchro plays.  <strong>Magikey Mechmortar - Garesglasser (x1</strong><strong>): </strong>You can also run 2, but it's very searchable. This is easily one of the best monsters in the deck, and you'll want to summon this if you get it in your hand.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Generic Stuff</strong></span>  <strong>Planet Pathfinder (x2): </strong>Something to search World with in case you don't draw it. Also gives an earth monster for the graveyard, but I still run Trumpeter for the sake of consistency. You won't always need your normal summon, since Mafteal gives you another once you have a Magikey around, so this works fine.  <strong>Rescue Rabbit (x2): </strong>For a deck revolving around normal monsters, this needs no explanation. If you feel like it, you can summon 2 Megalosmashers to make Dolkka or Laggia after you do the rest of your plays. You can also run 3, but I ran 2 since it only has 2 targets in this case.  <strong>Unexpected Dai (x2): </strong>Again, this needs no explanation. I have two since if you hard draw it on any turn after your first, it's useless more often than not. You CAN stack it with World instead of more useful cards for the situation.  <strong>Advanced Ritual Art (x2) and High Ritual Art (x1): </strong>Run however many of these you like, just be sure not to run TOO many.  <strong>Terraforming (x1):</strong> Searches World. Enough said.  <strong>Polymerization (x1): </strong>Summon First of the Dragons with this, that's its only purpose here.  <strong>Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, and Called By the Grave: (x3, 2, and 1 respectively):</strong> Do I really need to explain this?  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Extra Deck</strong></span>  <strong>First of the Dragons: </strong>Very nice card to have, since your opponent most likely can't out it with monsters.  <strong>Magikey Dragon - Andrabime: </strong>If your opponent only has one attribute, this is a Raigeki with wings. You can also draw 1 if your opponent's monster dies. I usually only summon this going second.  <strong>Magikey Beast - Ansyalalalalalalalalabolas: </strong>An Instant Fusion target, as well as something else to load the grave with. It's also a Tuner, like Batosbuster.  <strong>Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine: </strong>A Trap Hole on legs. Also searches any Magikey Spell/Trap except for World, and it can't be negated with Ash Blossom, since it sets from the deck.  <strong>Any generic Level 8 Synchro: </strong>Ansyalabolas and Batosbuster are tuners, as well as Trumpeter, so why not?. I recommend Dragite in particular for its backrow negate, since its summoning requirements are generic in addition to Megalosmasher's existence.  <strong>Magikey Spirit - Vepartu: </strong>You don't  always want to summon this, but if your opponent has something such as Dragoon or another monster with good protection, he's your guy.  <strong>Any generic Rank 4 Xyz: </strong>Again, most of the monsters here are level 4, so why not? You can also use Rank 8 monsters, but I would only run 1 or 2 of those max. There are some pretty good generic Rank 4 monsters out there like Castel, so I'd run some Rank 4s.  <strong>Any generic Link monster: </strong>Again, if you have the resources to spare or REALLY need something gone, Link monsters are a good option to have just in case. Phoenix in particular has helped me out of some sticky situations a few times."

I always liked the archtype and the support makes it someonewhat better, nevertheless it still is very subsceptible to any kind of hand trap. Its probably the strongest when going second since it doesnt combo very hard and relies a lot on the enemy GY (Dark Ruler or Lighting Storm are options since you cant play around any kind of negates the enemy sets up).  I added the little Utopia engine that is able to get Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray out easily since a lot of vimpire monsters are level 5 and easy to bring out. The ZW-cards also are no real brick on hand because you can Special Summon them most of the time when using a lot effects from vampire cards that drain your HP.  It is more of a casual deck that cant really compete on a meta level. <div class=""QmZWSe""> <div class=""DHcWmd""></div> </div>"

Thankfully, you have much better options. Both Branded Fusion and Magicalized Fusion allow you to go into your boss monster as long as you've drawn one Witchcrafter name or Magicians' Souls. Branded Fusion also serves as a plan B if you don't have any Witchcrafter names, allowing you to send the materials for Lubellion, make Mirrorjade and have a guaranteed way to make Vice-Master on your next turn by searching Branded Fusion with Albion's grave effect.  For me the main reason to play this deck is the interaction between Spell Chronicle and Patronus's grave effect, which allows you to add 5 Witchcrafter spells from the deck to your hand. To make this easier, I'm playing Foolish Burial Goods, which also gives you access to Genni on your opponent's turn with Witchcrafter Masterpiece and can put a Witchcrafter spell into rotation."

Trains ALWAYS want to go second if you have the choice.  If you have to go first, Dragoon is your best option. It's pretty easy to get two monsters on board to make Verte with how trains work. Dora is your second best option if you have to go first (if you know they can out Dragoon easily). In some special cases you can even make both going first!!!  In a recent regional tournament I had a judge rule that Interrupted Kaiju Slumber WILL WORK under Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds' lock as long as one of the targets is a wind monster. So take that ruling with a grain of salt because that's not how it actually works. That makes Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju your best out to Floowandereeze at the moment. <ul>  	<li>The Kaiju engine is to help break your opponents board by removing problem monsters and possibly getting you even more level 10 monsters. Three Jizukiru and Gadarla to help the chances of opening one of them, and only 2 Slumbers because if you draw one Kaiju you would make the third Slumber a dead card in the deck. One Kaiju card + Night Express Knight + Derricrane is usually enough for an OTK in most cases. Kaiju the problem, summon Express, Special Derricrane, XYZ into Gustav and burn for 2000. Then use Derricrane's effect to destroy the Kaiju. Overlay into Liebe, activate effect to make ATK 6000 and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Switchyard is your bread and butter. Don't have the level 10 you need? Just pitch what you don't want and add what you do. Switchyard gets shut down hard by Ash Blossom unfortunately; so you need to try to bait the Ash first if you really need that search.</li>  	<li>Switchyard + Pegasus +Bullet Train = 3 level 10s. Switchyard to pitch Bullet adding Derricrane. Summon Pegasus, activate effect to special Bullet from grave chaining Derricrane. If you already have those three monsters in hand, pitch Bullet to add Bullet, then do the combo again. Only this time you activate the second Bullet in hand for 4 level 10s. That's either a Liebe and a Dora, or a Dora and Dragoon, whichever board is stronger against your opponent.</li>  	<li>Try not to make both Zeus and Dragoon at the same time, they just counter each other and you'll usually end up sending your Dragoon to the grave when you don't want to.</li>  	<li>Urgent Schedule is one of the best cards in the deck. Depending how good or bad your hand is, you can easily end on a Liebe with Dora protection. Or, it'll save you during the battle phase by summoning two monsters (in defense) to absorb some damage. The two best monsters to summon off this are Ruffian and Bullet Train because of their end phase effects to get the cards you need into your hand.</li>  	<li>One funny combo happens when you have Switchyard on field, Urgent Schedule set, a level 10 in the grave, and a derricrane in hand. During your opponent's battle or end phase, activate Urgent Schedule to summon two monsters. Then, activate Switchyards effect to summon a level 4 and it becomes a level 10. Summon Pegasus making it a 10, then activate Pegasus' effect to summon the level 10 from grave chaining Derricrane so that Pegasus' effect won't be negated. 5 monsters summoned during your opponent's turn and they can't even Nibiru you (if you did it during their end phase). Make Dora first for protection on your turn, then do whatever combo you want that will hit them the hardest.</li>  	<li>Bullet Train and Ruffian are two very good cards you always want to send to the grave to get their effects. Ruffian gets you a level 10 Earth Machine from the deck and Bullet gets you ANY MACHINE from you grave. Adding back Pegasus for more combos next turn or Jizukiru to make your opponent worry about losing their boss monster if they can't win that turn. Trains is a mind game that makes your opponent overthink.</li>  	<li>When your opponent over extends, Nibiru them. A nicely timed Nib can stop a lot of decks. Unfortunately, Nib stops some combos, mainly with Bullet Train, but all you need to do is summon one other monster and you can Verte into Dragoon with ease.</li>  	<li>Angher Knuckle is there for when you can't XYZ summon to try to stall for a turn. It does have very good synergy with Bullet Train for card recursion though.</li>  	<li>Pentestag is there to poke through your opponent's defenses if need be.</li>  	<li>Phoenix and Robot Destroyer are there for backrow removal. Destroyer into Liebe into Zeus gets him 4 to 5 material depending on what effects you use, so that makes a nicely stacked Zeus for your opponent to deal with.</li>  	<li>Skypalace with a Derricrane attached is two pops and a 1000 burn that you can overlay Liebe onto.</li>  	<li>BLS is a good option for a lot of decks that do a lot of targeting or destroying like Altergeist. You also make it the correct way with at least one material being a level 7 or higher monster.</li>  	<li>I know it's weird to not main any hand traps, but with the Kaijus, I haven't really had a problem breaking boards.</li> </ul> With everything said and done, this is my current Trains deck and I usually end up in the top 4 with three other meta decks (we usually always split top 4).

I don't know Tim personally nor do I have any affiliation, formal or otherwise, with The Wiseguys TCG, channel, which is based in Kansas City--far from my hometown. Nevertheless, I would be remiss to not recognize Tim's contribution to deck-building theory around Buster Blader and Dragon Link in general. Tim topped his locals with a version of this deck I'm about to profile, and then proceeded to go on a multi-week (4+ if [Destruction Sword] memory serves me) undefeated tear at locals with his now-infamous Dragon Link-Fallen of Albaz deck. He's obviously not the first to run Buster Blader with Dragon Link, but this particular build is remarkably strong and solves a lot of the contradictions Destruction Sword decks often face, not least among them being how to play through disruptions. If this seems like a shameless plug, check out Tim and The Wiseguys TCG's videos and see for yourself. For my money, he's probably the best and most creative Buster Blader player in the U. today. YGOProDeck won't allow me to directly link to the YouTube video, so those who want to see Tim's deck should search for 'TOP 4 BUSTER BLADER DRAGON LINK DECK PROFILE FT. TIM - GAME CAFE !' on The Wiseguys TCG YouTube channel.  <span><b>Buuuusted Buster Blader</b></span>  Of all the Duel Monsters-era archetypes in YuGiOh, it often surprises newer players to learn that the most competitively viable among them at present is Buster Blader (also called Destruction Sword). This is not my opinion. As recent as summer of this year (2021), Buster Blader decks were taking respectable finishes in remote duel invitationals around the world, fueled in part--though not entirely--by the Dragon Link-dominated format before Guardragon Elpy got whacked. In May 2020,  Nikolas Konikkos took a relatively pure Destruction Sword deck through day-2 of the Niagra YCS tournament, putting the archetype on the map as a potential answer to DLink players everywhere. Other than the small and opportunistic Dragoon package, which requires players to run at least a single copy of Dark Magician to serve as fusion material, none of the other classic YGO icons have seen anything close to Buster's competitive success in recent years.  The reasons are pretty obvious to anyone familiar with the deck. Even by comparison with bigger YGO icons like Blue-Eyes White Dragon or Dark Magician, Buster Blader's Destruction Sword archetype has a remarkable amount of support available at this point. Destruction Sword/Buster Blader, technically two different archetypes for gameplay purposes, has its own fusion boss monster, level-8 synchro monster and one of the easiest Link-2s to make of all time. Trap cards like Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman avoid so many of the pitfalls of traps in general, sending the Buster fusion spell to the graveyard for cost and thus making it Ash-proof. Shortly after Union Carrier took its place on the Forbidden list, Buster Blader finally had its most potent control weapon returned to him, namely the Dragon Buster Destruction Sword that can completely lock an opponent out of using their extra deck.  Admittedly, Buster Blader decks are always going to have their best times when dragon-heavy decks predominate the format. Dragon Link isn't what it once was, falling precipitously to newer decks like Swordsoul and new blends on old recipes, like Dogmatika-Invoked-Shaddolls. Any given day and all things being equal, a competent Buster deck will wipe the floor with a competent dragon deck, DLink or not, but with fewer DLink decks running around in this format, the natural advantage it enjoyed isn't exactly actionable.  That being said, what makes Buster Blader work so well is its devastating, infamous Buster lock. So long as you have a dragon in the graveyard, resolving Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman will special summon Buster Dragon, a level-8 synchro dark dragon, whose effect turns all of the opponent's monsters into dragons. But if the player chooses to send another trap, Destruction Sword Memories, to the graveyard for Prologue's cost, they will also immediately summon out Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman--a level-8 fusion who (1) turns all dragons on the opponent's field to defense mode; (2) negates the effects of all dragons on the opponent's side of the field; (3) gains 1000 ATK for every dragon the opponent controls or has in-grave; and (4) inflicts piercing damage to monsters in defense position.  If that wasn't enough, Buster Dragon also allows a player to equip a Destruction Sword card in the graveyard to any Buster Blader monster--whether the OG Buster Blader, the retrain Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster, or the fusion--on the opponent's turn. There are three Destruction Sword equip monsters with varying effect, but in general, the only one that absolutely must make the main deck is a single copy of Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. Once equipped, the opponent cannot summon from their extra deck. Wizard Buster Destruction Sword, which as far as I'm concerned makes for an excellent side-deck inclusion at x1 in this format, turns off effects from activating in your opponent's graveyard, making it a great antidote to Invoked-Shaddolls decks. Robot Buster Destruction Sword, the third and least useful, restricts your opponent from activating the effects of spells and traps that are already face-up--potentially useful in some circumstances but it doesn't do enough to earn a spot in the deck, main or side.  The Buster lock is incredibly strong, effectively turning off many key avenues of play for the opponent with the successful resolution of a single card. Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman, a level-1 light dragon tuner, helps tremendously by searching out any Destruction Sword card and adding it to hand if normal summoned. If you have a way to get Buster Whelp into the graveyard--linking off, perhaps--before activating Prologue, it's a one-stop shop for setting up the basic Buster lock, serving as the generic 1 Dragon-type material requirement for making the Buster Blader fusion off of Destruction Sword Memories. With a murderers row of trap cards at its disposal, running Trap Trick x3 substantially raises the odds of getting Prologue set in your opening hand, one way or another. The deck's reliability, lightweight core engine and oppressive control aspects make it a very solid rogue-tier deck choice.  <span><b>Weapons of Mass Destruction Sword: Buster Blader in Dragon Link</b></span>  Without gilding the lily here, DLink puts some meat on the Buster Blader skeleton. To function optimally, the Buster Blader core requires running just 10-12 cards, meaning that it can fit nicely into a variety of other decks and coexist nicely with other archetypes. DLink, maybe ironically, is one of these synergistic decks that provide alternate win conditions and boost the consistency and reliability of establishing and, crucially, keeping the Buster lock in-place. Capable of putting up formidable boards loaded with disruption on its own, a disciplined DLink/Buster player has alternate routes to make Buster Dragon beyond simply resolving Prologue, which itself has the drawback of destroying your special-summoned Buster Dragon during the end phase of the following turn. After all, it's a level-8 synchro--something DLink can consistently make with ease. Dragon Link decks are known for their powerful starters and seemingly endless extenders, much of which results in a heavy graveyard full of dragons and other useful cards after turn-1. Dragons in-grave helps resolve Destruction Sword Memories, sure, but DLink's extenders give the player ways to follow up if somehow the opponent outs the Buster lock.  The temptation, though, is to just plop the 12-card Buster engine on top of a 40+ card Dragon Link deck. Theoretically this isn't a huge problem so long as ratios are kept correct. DLink already has outstanding search capacity and the powerful aforementioned starters/extenders to get things going. The problem is the extra deck. Conservatively, the Buster engine could take up as few as 2 cards in the extra deck, but even with cards like Chaos Space to recycle, this will likely leave the player unable to make followup plays in the event of serious disruption. General wisdom tends to say, 2x Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman, 2x Buster Dragon, 1x Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman. But while Buster's footprint in the main deck is light, he's taking up solidly a third of the extra deck. There's no way to run a full suite of the usual suspects in DLink, which also means that certain main deck staples are just not as necessary--even if they might be useful.  Case in point, I'm not running the Dragonmaid package here. We have plenty of trap-based disruption available as it is, and while this modest three-card package punches far, <em>far </em>above its weight, the deck can't go much higher than 45 cards and maintain its consistency. There's also a growing consensus that in a format marked by liberal use of Droll &amp; Lock Bird, Black Metal Dragon is a safer starter than Starliege Seyfert. I'm not sure if I agree, although I've split the difference here and put both BMD and Starliege at x2.  Similarly, the Rokket package here is far more modest and streamlined than a typical Dragon Link deck should run. Rokket Tracer x2 is a recognition of the importance of the synchro summon in this deck--worth more here than Rokket Synchron's extender effect. Absorouter and Noctovision are run at x1 each, though I would consider upping Nocto to x2 because of its little-used tertiary effect in-graveyard to protect cards set in the back-row. At any rate, the deck has plenty of level-1 tuners to make a level-8 synchro play in a pinch. Hell, even Buster Blader and the retrain are level-7 monsters.  <span><b>Busted Branded: Fallen of Albaz as Additional Disruptions in DLink</b></span>  Whether I'm running the Buster stuff at all or just playing a standard Dragon Link deck, Fallen of Albaz will be in the main deck--and at least three potential targets for his Super Poly-like effect will be in the extra deck. Because Albaz is a level-4 dark dragon-type, he's quite at home in DLink and synergizes well with the rest of the deck. Starliege Seyfert and Chaos Space, for instance, can pitch him to search White Dragon Wyverburster. In a pinch, he can even get our link plays started as a normal summon, allowing us to go into Striker Dragon and search the Boot.  But Albaz is more than another level-4 body. Ideally he doesn't show up in an opening hand, but I don't want to accidentally mill my only copy off of Chaos Ruler either. Running Albaz at x2 seems to work best since he's not a complete brick-draw either. Any worthwhile DLink deck is making Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres as part of its end-board--preferably sooner rather than later in the event of a Nibiru cataclysm. When tributed, Spheres will special summon out a dragon from the deck or hand at 0 / 0, making the effect of whatever dragon summoned from the deck all the more important. In the past, Omni Dragon Broutar was the go-to pick in order to search out Chaos Dragon Levianeer. More recently, Chamber Dragonmaid became the gold-standard for its ability to search its recyclable bounce-trap, Dragonmaid Tidying, immediately upon hitting the field.  Fallen of Albaz offers even greater disruption when summoned off of Spheres' tribute effect. So long as the player has a valid fusion target and a card in-hand to discard--which is easy enough since Spheres can bounce a card from your side of the field as well--Albaz's effect will trigger upon hitting the field, fusing off itself and an opponent's monster as materials for one of these targets.  At a minimum, three fusion monsters are necessary in this build:  <b>Albion the Branded Dragon </b>requires Fallen of Albaz and a light monster. It should come as no surprise to anyone that this becomes incredibly easy to make if an opponent drops Nibiru after you have brought out Spheres. Nibiru tributes Spheres, triggering the effect of the latter and bringing out Fallen of Albaz. Since Nibiru the Primal Being is itself a light monster, Albaz can use the Nibiru summoned to your opponent's side of the field as fusion material for Albion.  Albion's effect is stupid broken, especially in this deck. On summon, Albion can summon a level-8 or lower fusion monster from the extra deck by banishing fusion materials listed on the target from the hand, field or graveyard. In other words, so long as you have a Buster Blader in-hand, on the field or in the graveyard, <b>Albion can make Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman without ever needing to resolve Destruction Sword Memories in the grave</b>.  <b>Borreload Furious Dragon</b>, however, is an equally useful target in this build. For one, if Albaz is summoned while Buster Dragon is on the field, any dark monster on your opponent's side becomes a dark dragon-type monster, allowing Albaz to use it as material. This comes up occasionally, although Furious is more typically a follow-up fusion summon off of Albion's effect. This is Dragon Link--you're never going to have a hard time coming up with 2 dark dragons to banish as materials from the hand, field or grave. Furious itself has a useful quick effect, which allows it to pop a card on your opponent's side of the field by popping 1 monster you control.  <b>Sprind the Irondash</b> <b>Dragon</b>--sadly, a machine-type and not a dragon as its name suggests--has a fine effect itself, which allows it to move to a column during the player's main phase and destroy all face-up cards in the column. This can prove useful, but its real virtue is its astonishingly simple summoning requirement: Fallen of Albaz + 1 Effect Monster Special Summoned this turn. Sprind becomes the miscellaneous Albaz fusion target off of Spheres' effect since most monsters summoned on your opponent's turn meet the criteria. Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, for instance, would generally negate Spheres' bounce effect, but since Spheres tributes itself for cost, Fallen of Albaz will special summon from the deck--and as long as Dragoon was brought out that same turn, Albaz can fuse it and himself off for Sprind.  Additional fusion targets come up, like the ubiquitous Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and even Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. Albion, Titaniklad and Sprind all have end-phase graveyard effects too, which search or recycle Fallen of Albaz and/or related spells (Branded in White, for example). Even as we anticipate the release of even better Albaz fusion targets in next year's structure deck, the basic lineup available today still works remarkably well in Dragon Link.  <strong><span>Tech</span></strong>  Since Artifact Lancea is such a powerful hand trap in this format, Artifact Dagda makes a lot of sense in the extra deck--and by extension, so does Artifact Scythe x1 in the main deck. I could see substituting this out since it more or less constitutes just another way to lock the opponent out of the extra deck--something that Dragon Buster Destruction Sword does already when equipped. For now, I've found it useful as a redundancy in the event that the Buster lock gets disrupted. Halqifibrax would make for a solid substitute since it can tutor out Dragon Buster Destruction Sword with its effect, though I've found I rarely went this route in building the initial board. At any rate, Protector Whelp can send it to the graveyard too for Buster Dragon to equip to a Buster Blader on your opponent's turn.  Red Reign x2 probably looks a lot more gimmicky than it really is in this deck. For one, both DLink and Buster decks are making synchro monsters as part of their end boards, meaning its rare that the card cannot activate. We're also running Trap Trick x2, which can search and set a copy of Red Reign. If I open with Prologue and Trap Trick, Red Reign is the target. With Buster Dragon on the board, along with at least 1 level-8 fusion, Red Reign will banish all monsters except those with the highest level. The surviving monsters are unaffected by card effects other than their own for the remainder of the turn, which prevents your opponent from breaking your Buster lock. Since link and xyz monsters have no level, they are banished by default--something I've used to devastating effect against Tri-Brigade. It's also recyclable from the graveyard with the summon of a level-8 dark dragon synchro-monster, which comes up in a grind game from time to time. As busted as Red Reign plays in this deck though, it only narrowly edged out Gravity Collapse, which I've included in the side deck at x2.  Tim Rokov's videos on this deck and other similar builds utilizing Fallen of Albaz go into greater detail on the potential combo lines, and I'll end by reiterating my props to The Wiseguys TCG YouTube channel. I suspect that as Fallen of Albaz sees greater play in meta-competitive decks over the year to come, Dragon Link players will start to experiment with and incorporate Albaz and his many draconic forms into the deck that never dies."

The undisputed star of Counter Fairies is Bountiful Artemis. This final stage of zombie-camel evolution is from a time before every draw effect needed a once-per-turn clause attached to it. But, this is honestly needed for the deck to even stand a chance against any semi-competent deck. Without the ability to regain the advantage you lose by using all of your Counter Traps, you would be completely beaned after a single turn. Run 3 of this card every time you even think of building this deck.  The next star of the show is Guiding Ariadne. Do you remember playing a game of Yu-Gi-Oh and having the internal debate that all players have at one point in their lives where you asked yourself if activating Solemn Judgment was going to be worth the 4000 lifepoints to activate? Well now you don't have to worry. Ariadne just straight up removes the cost of most Counter Traps, letting you activate all 9 Solemns in one game and even a full playset of Seven Tools alongside it.  The final main-deck monster is Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath. That mouthful of a card really shouldn't be played at more than one. You may look at his summoning condition and yell at me for not including a few more fairies, but to that I say: ""Have you read Rebirth of Parshath?"" And hell, if you're in a tight spot you can still summon him the regular way. I'd just rather not banish my Artemis for a bungus if possible.  The rest of the deck is really self-explanatory. Pot of Extravagance, Pot of Duality, and Card of Demise help you dig for your Artemis turn 1. Sanctuary in the Sky and Sanctum of Parshath both turn on Divine Punishment. Terraforming is just here so you can deck thin a smidgen. And then the Counter Trap suite is all up to preference. I do recommend at least having the three Solemns, Divine Punishment, and Rebirth of Parshath. The rest are all variable, and some other solid options not found in the main or side deck are Black Horn of Heaven, Trap of Board Eraser, Spell Vanishing, Ultimate Providence, and Judgment of Anubis. Do not play Grand Horn of Heaven. Trust me, I tried. The card sounds super cool in practice, but it can't negate a summon that does not start a chain, restricts you to only the main phase, and completely shits itself if your opponent drops Prosperity or Extrav (Ya know, two really good cards that most decks run if they can afford it).  The side deck is just to cover your weak spots. Gameciel does what it has always done and just schlorps up a problem boss monster. Heavy Storm Duster pops backrow and dodge's Imperial Order (which this deck really doesn't care about). Lost Sanctuary is just another copy of Sanctuary that can maybe negate an effect once in a while. To be honest, you can just cut this and run one of the Counter Traps I listed above instead. Seven Tools of the Bandit is just if you really really need to stop traps from activating. And Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell is for killing any Pacifis players dreams of playing the game of Yu-Gi-Oh.  This deck can also run Lord of the Heavenly Prison, which is just a really good card to have in backrow decks. Realistically, you were never losing to backrow removal anyway with your 9 spell/trap negates and 12 monster effect negates, but it's still nice to have a 3k beatstick to close out games. You can also run Prosperity if you really want to dig for the exact card you need. I personally think it's better to get a quick draw 2 in this deck than an extra set of Dualities, but that's just my preference. Another card that pops up in Counter Fairy lists is Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord. This card is terrible, but also extremely funny to resolve. Run it if you're a braver man/woman/everything else in between and outside than I. You can also put actually decent cards in the Extra Deck as well.

This description is outdated, I'll write a new one at some point.  """"""Main Deck  Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon is fine at two because its searchable with Beyond and Revolution Dragon and its better to have 2 Arc Pendulum and 3 Revolution because if you need Darkwurm or Persona instead Revolution is a more versatile card to have drawn. Dragonpit is at one to deal with floodgates like summon limit or mystic mine and its also very searchable with Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance to search out Pendulum call. Dharma-Eye is just the best Level 7 Scale 3 or lower Magician Pendulum Monster, giving destruction protection to all of your Magicians for a turn when you Pendulum summon making, it in my opinion, better than the obscure Xiangke and situational Dragoncaller but its effect doesn't come up too often so feel free to substitute it for any of the other two or even another Dragonpit. Gate Zero is at 2 so that your Darkwurm and Dragon Shrines + Foolish Burial are live even if you draw into one copy and its ok to open because its a good scale and useful level for making Absolute. Chronograph is one of your nine starters and its pretty versatile, being useable as a scale 8 and getting you a level 3 magician to make Dawn Dragster if you haven't got the resources to spare for a Celestial. Persona is at one as a low scale to be searched out with Revolution Dragon and a good target for Hieratic if you brick and can't make a full board, its also useful to bring out turn 3 as another negate by searching it out with Skullcrobat. Speaking of Skullcrobat I would run it at three if it were unlimited because its an amazing Stratos-Like Effect that searches your entire deck and its just a shame that is good scale of 8 is hampered by that restriction stopping you from summoning any Supreme King Monsters with it, its the card you want to add off Celestial for follow up plays next turn. Darkwurm comes up a bit too much at three so two is fine to keep your Dragon Shrines live and Still normal summon it occasionally and Darkwurm is at its best if you discard it as the cost for Pendulum Call to then summon it back and essentially go +3, gaining a card on field and a card in hand as well as fetching a Harmonizing to Pend summon later and get its +1 effect. Performapal Celestial Magician is the best scale 8 to end on and you will always want to pend summon it or normal summon it to make Beyond rather than summoning it from deck with Harmonizing so that you can add a Skullcrobat in the end phase. Curtain Raiser needs a reprint and will probably never get one because Konami hates Pends and it serves as the worst starter that you are forced to play because since Astrograph was banned we are in need of more Pends with Special summon effects to use to make Beyond. Harmonizing Magician is amazing and you will usually want to try to use it to summon Dragonpit to make absolute and then tune it with Celestial or if you must because of a bad hand tune it with Timegazer to make Dawn Dragster. Timegazer is a one of garnet that's is absolutely terrible to draw and is only here to be summoned off of Chronograph as a starter. Allure of Darkness is a staple in any deck running DARK Monsters and if you haven't noticed all but two of our main deck Monsters are DARK so run three. Dragon Shrine is the best starter because dumping Darkwurm is great and probably better than Chronograph because its just a more useful type of card advantage than extra spellcasters with bad levels. Duelist alliance is essentially more copies of Pendulum Call and if you already have a Pend Call you can search Arc Pendulum, its also fine to open multiple cos you can search with one then discard the second to activate Pend Call. Foolish Burial is just another Dragon Shrine. Pendulum Call is amazing and I will never run less than three in any deck I ever make ever, you can discard Darkwurm for good advantage and a starter or just discard another card that you opened too many of or isn't live at the moment and it has a neat interaction with celestial where if you use Celestials Pendulum Effect it won't be able to destroy itself but the effect can still resolve. Upstart Exists, always play one in every deck ever unless its a burn deck.  Extra Deck  Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon is easily the best Odd-Eyes Monster being able to shuffle back you previously used Pendulums to Negate anything except a Spell/Trap that activates from the GY, I usually put it in defense position because 3k is pretty good and you can always switch its position next turn. Zeus is hilarious to make going second and the best way to make it is with Utopia int Utopia Prime attack into 4-Material Zeus in MP2. Absolute Dragon is a key combo Piece that you use to make a three material Apolluosa with Beyond and another random Monster meaning it will then float into a vortex as soon as it hits the GY, its other effect is pretty nice to being able to bring back an Arc Pendulum if it negates an attack. Utopia the Lightning is good for Bonking stuff like Dragoon to death and dealing game damage if your opponent is low. Utopia Prime has an effect that might go off like once ever and is mainly a stepping stone to get Lightning and Zeus to 4 materials. Same goes for the regular No. 39. Dark Rebellion is great for doing massive damage and is just fun to use. I've been leaning more towards Adamancipator Risen - Dragite as my ending Level 8 Synchro because you can revive it with Celestial and we already have quite a few Monster Negates so I think it may actually be better to run than Savage Dragon in this deck. Ignister Prominence is the best sort of removal ever and is good to use later game as spot removal, the summon ability is ok so play a single Luster or Master Pendulum if you feel like it. Clear Wing is this decks only board wipe and it also has a pretty good Construct-like effect to destroy before damage calc so its good to have as an option. Dawn Dragster is a good Level 7 to make if you have a Timegazer in your extra deck and one level 7 when you search Harmonizing with Beyond but you don't have any Level 4 Magicians to make Savage/Dragite. Apollousa is possibly the best unbanned/unerrated link 4 in the game and it shows, you wanna make it with Beyond, Absolute and whatever random starter you have left to give it 2400 ATK and still have enough monsters to make a Level 7/8 Synchro, if you can afford it then maybe Unchained Abomination or a Borrel Link 4 would do as a substitute. Beyond the Pendulum is Insane, it searches out any combo piece and has a really good boardbreaking effect that is incredibly easy to chainblock with Harmonizing Magician or Darkwurm, its nuts and I am super Hyped for Dimension Force. Hieratic seal is the last resort option to make if you brick with no starters, get out four monsters, make an absolute then make a Hieratic with the Absolute to get vortex and then when you use Hieratic, summon Persona Dragon is defense position.  Side Deck  this side deck is pretty broad for going against loads of different decks and its also a bit pricey. Sphere Mode is fucking bullshit and if you're willing to give up your normal summon basically any board is toast before it, maybe replace it with a Kaiju if its to expensive. Lava Golem is cheap and is basically a slightly worse sphere mode that still packs one hell of a punch being able to tribute two monsters is still enough to break a lot of boards. Dark Ruler No More, its really great in in this deck fits better than Droplet, Book of Eclipse is an ok alternative if you can't afford a playset of DRNM. D Barrier is possibly one of the most unfair cards that's still legal and since the current Meta is basically free of tribute and Link archetypes aside from Flunders its incredibly lethal to flip as soon as you recognize what deck your opponent is playing. Lastly Judgement is still such a strong card and can stop enemy DRNM or an important summon so yeah pretty good for such ancient card and its always live even if you're at 1 LP.'''  I'll try to list a YouTube video of how to do the main combo at some point if I remember or someone comments telling me too. Also please Konami free our beloved Astrograph and Electrumite and maybe even Monkeyboard if you're feeling generous.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Snipe hunter allows you to dump your entire hand while destroying the field, drawing cards, and special summoning. Use super polymerization to go into big fusion monsters while also possibly sniping your opponent's monsters. This deck is super underrated and I am aware that this is likely a variant better than this but I personally love this version."

It's a hybrid Tenyi build that focuses on some elements of control but also works to swarm the field with monsters while generating a decent hand advantage.  To start, we play three <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a>, three <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a>, two <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a>, two <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a>, two <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and two <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a>, this makes up the core of our Tenyi build. for those of you who don't know all of the Tenyi monsters have the effect to summon from hand, swarming the field so as long as you control no effect monsters, however, while they're in your hand or grave they're secondary effect comes into play. While you control even one Non-Effect monster <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a> can summon a Tenyi from deck, <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a> can banish from hand or grave and target a card your opponent controls returning it to the deck, <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a> can banish to reduce an opponent's monsters attack by 1500, <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a> can negate a card that target's one of your Non-Effect monsters, <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a> can reborn one of your Non-Effect monsters that was destroyed by battle or card effect, and <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a> can add one of your banished Tenyi monsters back to your hand. For the rest of the deck we play two <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> to stop your opponent from gaining too strong a field, two <a data-name=""Mimicking Man-Eater Bug"">Mimicking Man-Eater Bug</a>, that when face down, you are still able to summon Tenyi monsters and when attacked or flipped will target a monster your opponent controls, destroy it, gain that monsters original attack and type, and has the bonus of not being able to be destroyed by monsters with the type you just acquired. In addition, we also run two <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> and three <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> to stop your opponent from attacking. Two <a data-name=""Droll"">Droll</a> and one <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> as the hand traps, a <a data-name=""Called By"">Called By</a> to fill your grave with a Tenyi not in hand, and finally, we're running two <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> to add a Wyrm to hand. Two <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a>, two <a data-name=""Blackout"">Blackout</a> and a <a data-name=""Pank"">Pank</a> for removal, one <a data-name=""Reborn"">Reborn</a>, one <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, and one Metaverse for obvious reasons and one copy of<a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi""> Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a>, what is essentially a pot of greed every time your opponent special summons an effect monster, and it makes your Non-Effect monsters unaffected by monster effects.  For the extra deck, we have three <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> and one <a data-name=""Lanphorhynchus"">Lanphorhynchus</a>, easy link fodder for your main deck Tenyi's. Two <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> to bring back a Wyrm from grave. One <a data-name=""Ra'Ten"">Ra'Ten</a> and one <a data-name=""Sahasrara"">Sahasrara</a> to help flood the field. Two <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> to act as a Non-Effect beat stick. One <a data-name=""Yazi"">Yazi</a> for the synchro, one <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> for spell and trap removal, one <a data-name=""Borreload"">Borreload</a> just in case, and one <a data-name=""World Chalice Almarduk"">World Chalice Almarduk</a> for destruction. The final spot is filled by one <a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a> it can bring back a Non-Effect when it's destroyed, boost Non-Effects attack by 500, lower's effect monster attack by 500.  The side is pretty self-explanatory, <a data-name=""Lancea"">Lancea</a>, <a data-name=""Ash"">Ash</a>, and <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> are all great hand traps. <a data-name=""Dark ruler"">Dark ruler</a> shuts down monster effects, an extra <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection"">Flawless Perfection</a> if you really need to draw it. Two <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a> for negation and possible summons, and two <a data-name=""Dragon Cycle"">Dragon Cycle</a> for searching and summoning.  There's no perfect end board for this deck it's built to adapt and change with games not to OTK your opponent. For the most part, you want to focus on link climbing and spamming with your main deck Tenyi's, setting up a board that has two or three Non-Effect monsters like Monk or Berserker and a few Tenyi's in the grave. You'll want to rely on the disruption this deck provides by using the Tenyi's, Man-Eater Bugs, and Droll's to stop your opponent from comboing off. After that, you can set up with a Vanity's Fiend to prevent special summoning or a Lava Golem on your opponent's side with a Battle Fader in hand or Threatening Roar set to stop their battle phase and rack up some burn damage.  There are a few pros and cons to this Deck I've noticed so far. Pro's: there's a lot of negates and effects in this deck to help you in turn two, it's flexible with what cards can be exchanged from the side deck, and has a lot of removal power against your opponent, and this build plays fairly well through most disruption. Cons: It's only ok going second, it's a little slow, and that pace can sometimes lose you the game, also Gravekeeper, decks that banish your grave, and cards that prevent special summoning counters this deck pretty hard.

Dinorphia/Dinoruffia deck profile December 2021/January 2022 (Post-Dimension Force),"  This is going to be my final deck profile for 2021, and the final video I am uploading for 2021. So here it is, a Dinorphia deck profile featuring the 2 new cards revealed to be in Dimension Force. Dinorphia Rexsturm requires a ""Dinorphia"" Fusion monster and another ""Dinorphia"" monster, and Dinorphia Frenzy allows you to Fusion Summon it using a Dinorphia from your Deck AND Extra Deck as material!  &nbsp;  Since this deck is almost nothing but Traps, your goal should always be to go first, and try to summon Kentregina or Rexsturm during your opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  Oh, and speaking of Rexsturm, it has 2 effects. If any monsters on your opponent's field have ATK that isn't lower than your Life Points, they can't activate their effects. And during either player's turn, you can pay half your life points to make those monsters' ATK equal to your Life Points! So it's a good stun card."

Combo starters are Venus, as mentioned above, &amp; a <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> combo that summons <a data-name=""Master Flare Hyperion"">Master Flare Hyperion</a> to copy Venus' effect. After summoning Shines with these, you can replace 2 of  them with your Link-1's and use all the materials to summon Saryuja  Extenders to focus on are Pot of Avarice, The Agent of Life - Neptune, &amp; The Agent of Destruction - Venus.  Main idea is to spam synchros as much as possible to draw a bunch off of Hyper Librarian (this should always be your first synchro summon if possible).

Predaplant got some nice support, and so did Fallen of Albaz, so I slapped them together with a couple Despia, Dogmatika and Shaddoll cards and called it a day!  The main deck is just some standard stuff really. There's 2 Orphys Scorpio, 1 Darlingtonia Cobra, 1 Chlamydosundew and 1 Spinodionaea(for counters), plus 2 each of the new pends Triantis and Bufollicula and 2 Byblisp from Predaplants, along with 2 copies of Predapractice to help board presence and pull more to hand, 1 Predapruning, and the only traps are 1 each Predaplanet and Predaplanning. They have useful on board effects but also offer something while in grave, planning being a destruction and planet being another fusion card. The Shaddoll package is simple, 1 each of Wendi, Ariel, Beast, Squamata, Dragon and Hedgehog. Squamata gives you more mill, Hedgehog pulls one to hand, Wendi summons one from deck, Beast draws a card, Dragon destroys 1 Spell/Trap and Ariel banishes 3 cards from either grave, and since Shaddolls like going to grave, you'll be activating their effects a lot. I also have one copy each of Shaddoll Fusion and El Shaddoll Fusion. El Shaddoll is a target to add to hand when you Nadir Servant El Shaddoll Apkallone since you can set it and quick fuse Winda on the opponent's turn without having to discard for Super Poly. Dogmatika Ecclesia and Fleurdelis are simple staples and offer Light attribute necessary for both El Shaddoll Construct and Albion the Branded Dragon without having to use your extra deck for them. I chose to run 1 Dramaturge of Despia because I like its recursion and board presence, plus it offers a negate, and Aluber gives additional search for Branded Fusion and the other spells like Branded Opening and Despia, Theater of the Branded. The real stars of the show are 1 Springans Kitt offering even more search, and  2 Fallen of Albaz. I run 2 because I've found myself running into trouble using him in hand for a fusion, then trying to use Branded Fusion to pull from deck. There is a third(technically) by using Albion the Shrouded Dragon, but getting it into position to make it count as Albaz for a fusion has proven troublesome, so I tend to use it to send 1 Albaz to grave and swap Albion for something. The remaining cards are Foolish Burial to get Byblisp to proc, 2 Polymerization, 1 Super Polymerization(removal is always nice) 1 Raigeki, and 1 Monster Reborn. So I'm a little scrubby and I like Monster Reborn, sue me.  &nbsp;  The Extra Deck was harder since there were so many good options I had to choose between, but I ultimately decided at base, it's purely fusions. There's so many cards that lock you into fusion only, I did a test hand and ended up with 4 of those restrictions layered on top of each other. Predaplant Ambulomelioides is EXTREMELY integral because it can be fused in hand, search a Predaplant on summon, tribute itself or another monster to then summon another one, and I like to use it to tribute another low level monster, summon Chalmydosundew, then use sundew's effect to fuse into Dragostapelia. Dragostapelia is  a very good card because it has a quick effect predator counter stack, and a continuous effect where anything with a predator counter has it's effects negated. It spreading counters so easily is very beneficial to 2 of this deck's boss monsters, Triphyoverutum and Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon. Triph gains attack equal to every monster with a predator counter's attack so it can skyrocket very easily with Drago, Triantis(if used for a fusion, it applies counters equal to the number of monsters you control) and Spino. In addition, once a turn, Triph can negate 1 Extra Deck summon from your opponent and destroy the monster. SVPFD on the other hand can tribute any monster with a predator counter to negate something your opponent is doing. Any card or effect (that can be responded to) is just negated, simple as that, so if you can manage Drago and SVPFD, which this deck absolutely CAN do, you get 2 negates with this combo. Chimerafflesia is an extra I added, but it's still useful because its requirements mean you can use most of the Shaddolls and a Predaplant and again, does not need to be on board! For Shaddolls, it's just Construct, Apkallone and Winda, that's really all you need. Or at least, all I've ever seen people use from Shaddoll. Construct destroying any special summoned monster in battle before damage calc, Winda locking players into 1 special summon each turn while it's on board, and Apkallone giving a search when sent to grave, and the negate on summon is a nice benefit if you do decide to summon it. I run Despia Quaeritis because it's got flexible materials, and the quick effect dropping non-fusion and low level fusion monster attacks to 0 is nice since this is a fusion deck. I also run Masquerade, the Crimsongleam Dragon because it's more options to put pressure on your opponent if you go first, causing burn for every play they make. I use 1 Albion the Branded Dragon for using with Branded Fusion to send a Dogmatika to grave, so I can then summon Lubellion with it's effect by banishing the Albaz I sent to grave and a dark monster, which then ideally leaves me a Shaddoll in hand I can discard, or one in grave that I then fuse into Construct. I've done a lot of tests on running optimal lines for this, and this gives you three fusions on board, and only needs a little grave setup prior. I have Titaniklad because sometimes damage is necessary, but it doesn't do a whole lot else other than maybe be a Nadir Servant target or even a Super Poly choice. Mirrorjade is nice for its quick effect non-targeting banish and is a good option if you don't want to make a board full of fusions and only want a couple, both Albion and Lubellion lead really nicely into it. This just leaves Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and, it's just good. Any 2 Dark monsters on field so it is a great Super Poly target to remove troublesome boss monsters like Accesscode Talker, Borrelsword Dragon, Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, Destiny HERO Destroy Phoenix Enforcer, all sorts of nasty stuff just so happens to be Dark, and if Starving Venom gets destroyed, it'll destroy any and all special summoned monsters on your opponent's field it can.  I wanted this deck to have options, and usually, thanks to all the search, I consistently get 3+ fusions on board. Out of all the tests, maybe 5 duels I ended with 2 or fewer monsters turn one, and the remaining like, 40, i've had at least 3, most often 4 monsters on board, and this deck can even pump out a completely full board with Winda, Construct, Drago and Dramaturge.  Also pls no bulli, this is my first attempt at seriously building a deck, I've just been netdecking until now but the new support was too juicy for me to not experiment with. I don't use side decks so I just slapped in whatever."

I feel like D-Barrier is a good option, especially with Swordsoul and Drytron kicking around right now. Floowandereeze is definitely a tough matchup though.  &nbsp;  I don't really think that 3 copies of Secret Village is the way to go, but running the Terraforming to search it is essentially 3 copies, and can thin your deck just a little bit. I also find that Strike, while a really good card, can be too detrimental in the late-game. I know that's a sign of a bad Geist player, so feel free to flame me.  &nbsp;  Lastly, I find that the Extra Deck monsters can be really helpful in the late game, especially if you can get to Hexstia pointing to Memorygant, so I run 2 Extrav. This decision has actually never screwed me over, at least not yet. I just find that being able to keep some stuff in the ED can help when you start getting to the grind game.  &nbsp;  IO and Summon Limit in the Side because, I mean, ya gotta run floodgates if you wanna win.

Draw and several different add engines. Deck almos","&nbsp;  INTRODUCION:  First, does it make sense to upload a deck on old banlist? Mhh for me it has sense, the stupid banlists took us too many great monsters, combos and decks. Of course, I am not allowed to speak for the entire Yu-Gi-Oh community, but that's how my heart feels. I've been working on this deck for a long time (between 2020/2021), unfortunately the first 2021 banlist crush this deck. Of course I expected this and I was going to upload this deck earlier, but striving for perfection did not allow me finish. The name of the deck is not accidental (""Drytron &amp; Perfection"") and I hope you will see it.  Provides a very good foundation for the future decks, especially if the banlist changes accordingly.  I know I didn't show many decks this year (in fact it will be the first), but I had reasons. And I assure you that my love for Yu-Gi-Oh cards is not lost and never will be and I hope people can see this in most of my decks. I'm just a sick man, and I shouldn't be sitting at the computer for a long time. Unfortunately, building and tests a great decks (I hope they are great) sometimes takes a long time. Deck in this form is very strong and hard to stop, but judge it for yourself.  Limited to one ""Cyber Angel Benten"" proper was a death sentence not only for this deck but also for many ritual decks especially cooperating with Drytron archetyp. Apparently KOMANI didn't want ritual decks to spread its wings. But I know and I feel ritual decks give us many more great victories in the future not only in NO BANLIST competitions. And I know that there will be people who will like this deck very much (those who swim against the tide) and for them I do this. Ritual Monsters FOREVER ;)  &nbsp;  DECKLIST:  Now let's move to decklist. You must remember that this deck was created in January and then it was 100% up to date. ""Forbidden Droplet"" - may not be needed at times when ""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"" and ""True King of All Calamities"" are baned. I think you could use instead 3 other cards. Triple Tactics Talent also is optional. Side deck there is only a suggestion. I wouldn't experiment with the rest deck because I think it is optimized perfectly. But it's your decision (and I would make this decision based on opponent's deck).  TACTICS: (I will try to explain it simply so that everyone can understand especially newcomers).  Going first:  Of course at the beginning we should use ""Pot of Extravagance"" if we have him in hand (this also applies to further cards). Next ""Cyber Emergency"" first effect and we add the card we need for combo (that of course will depend on what already we have in hand). We use the second effect Cyber Emergency if necessary and we can discard for example Drytron monster whose effect we can use later in GY. Next ""Drytron Fafnir"" we add the card we need for combo and as above. And ""Preparation of Rites"" and this could be a very important moment, especially if we don't have yet ""Cyber Angel Benten"" im hand ;) Next ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"" and this will be the second very important effect. And vs many hand trap, may turn out to be crucial. Remember that if your opponent has for example use 3 hand traps cards it may not be necessary much, to block him in the next round. One negate or Vanity's Ruler lock or both in the field, depending on the opponent's deck. Also, keep in mind that some of these effects can be used repeatedly in 1 turn.  It is also prudent to use ""Drytron Alpha Thunban"" (if we use for tribute ""Cyber Angel Benten"")   in such a way as to add first ""Cyber Angel Benten"", and then add ""Herald of Perfection"" using effect ""Cyber Angel Benten"" in GY, because ""Cyber Angel Benten"" we usually need it much more ( it's such a small security vs hand trap in some situations).  &nbsp;  The tactic is very simple, consists in entering to the field: ""Herald of Perfection"" &amp; ""Vanity's Ruler"". Enter Herald of Perfection quite quickly (to have something vs Nibiru for example or other hand traps). Drytrons effects take place in hand or in a cemetery which makes this archetype resilient. Obviously the main weapon of this deck (next to ""Vanity's Ruler"") are multiple negates. And so that everything has hands and feet, we introduce Vanity's Ruler &amp; Herald of Perfection with one neat combo. By the way(during comba), we add to your hand ""Vanity's Ruler"" &amp; ""Eva"" (to increase the number of negates +2). You can also add too hand for example: ""Artifact Lancea"" or ""Herald of orange light"" or ""Herald of Green Light"" etc depending on the needs. With good hands, we can also introduce strong link 4 or or higher or for example ""Knightmare Cerberus"" co-linked with Knightmare Phoenix for more fun from game hehe.  TIPS AND TRICKS:  There is another defense mechanism built into deck in case of cards such as ""Dark Ruler No More"" or ""Forbidden Droplet"". ""Herald of Perfection"" is negated, but not his cost. Therefore we can use ""Herald of Perfection"" and use his effect, of course we don't negate anything but the cost we will have to pay and we can use ""Eva"" as a cost then we use ""Eva"" effect to add 2 cards from the deck and we can add for example ""Herald of Orange Light"" vs monsters deck and use an atypical hand trap. In other situations you can also use it we just add other cards for example Herald of Green Light vs powerful spell and so on.  Going Second:  First, if they are in the field set spell/trap or continuous spell/trap (floodgates) we destroy them, we use ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" or ""Twin... cards in side deck. And for some annoying effects I recommend good old ""Evenly Matched"" ;) OR/AND We mainly use links and we systematically destroying the opponent's cards (relinquished anima, Geonator Transverser, Knightmare links or Avramax), depending on the needs. And of course ""Accesscode Talker"" for fast OTK.  SUMMARY:  Finally, I want to thank everyone who uses my decks and over a 1,5 million users ygoprodeck who watched my decks. You have been with me since December 2019 and you were with me through a difficult 2020 year (difficult for me not through COVID). I wants to dedicate deck for Oscar B. you will forever be in our hearts BRO. Thank again and remember, play for fun, not always for win. If you always play for win you newer play for fun. And then it doesn't make sense anymore. Remember also about our younger colleagues, insults and hate this shouldn't be in the game either.  Respect and as always GL HF.              Happy New Year."

This is my very own Satellarknight Zefra list!  It's mainly an XYZ spam deck that seeks to control the board with Triverr while also increasing consistency through a Zefra engine, all while accruing advantage through redundant search effects or bounce effects.  While this deck isn't the most competitive deck on the planet, it is <em>incredibly</em> fun to play, so I thought I'd share it with you all!  <span><em>THE ENGINES;</em></span>  The Zefra cards serve 3 purposes: 1) to prove scales to more easily assemble the necessary materials for a Tellarknight XYZ monster while still triggering main deck Tellarknight monster effects, 2) to increase consistency through Zefraath, Oracle and Providence by either searching up Pendulum Scale pieces <em>or</em> searching other Tellarknight monsters (Zefraxciton and Zefrathuban) for XYZ plays, and 3) to provide a going-first control package with Zefraniu, Nine Pillars, Divine Strike, and War.  Zefraath is a key card here - I've never actually summoned it since you only want it in the Pendulum Scale.  It allows us to dump a Zefra monster (usually Zefraniu going first and later Zefrathuban or Zefraxciton for extending plays) to the extra deck to copy that monster's Pendulum Scale rating.  Assuming we have the opposite Scale set as well, we'll be able to Pendulum Summon that monster; however, since Zefraath's normal Scale is 5, it is very easy to Pendulum Summon our Tellarknight monsters if this effect doesn't go through.  The main deck Tellarknight cards provide consistency, either by searching Scales or follow-up cards with Deneb, dumping Tellarknight monsters in grave with Unukalhai, or by recurring Tellarknight monsters in grave for XYZ plays with Altair.  Vega is good for extending if our Scales don't survive our opponent's turn (although they should due to Providence's in-grave effect) while Alsham gives us access to burn damage if the game is running into time, or we just need an easy finisher.  Keep in mind that all these effects trigger if the Tellarknight monster is Summoned - not just Normal or Special Summoned, but also Pendulum Summoned (hence the value of the Zefra engine).  The extra deck Tellarknight cards are how we win the game.  We usually want to win with Triverr, since it bounces every card on the field other than itself, then let's us discard a card from our opponent's hand, essentially letting us dismantle our opponent's board while (hopefully) discarding any cards they could use for a follow-up play. The hidden power of Triverr is in bouncing <em>our own</em> cards to the hand.  Our board, usually being Oracle of Zefra and Pendulum cards in the Scales, is easily rebuildable, plus we can get repeated activations from a single copy of Oracle, allowing us to set up for next turn.  Plus, Triverr brings back a Tellarknight monster if it's destroyed.  Delteros is spot removal that can float if destroyed while providing protection for us when we Summon monsters.  Constellar Diamond is easy to go into and is a floodgate on a stick against certain decks that want to dump things to the grave or recur cards from the grave to the hand.  The negation effect doesn't always come up, but when it does, it is very powerful.  Batlamyus is there to get us into these three monsters easier if we only have 2 Tellarknight monsters to summon.  <em><span>OTHER CARDS:</span></em>  Ash Blossom and Imperm are here for negations - feel free to change these to adapt to your meta as you see fit.  Terraforming and RotA are here for more consistency - we want to see Oracle, and RotA can grab almost every one of our main deck monsters.  Satellarknight Skybridge - an interesting tech that I like to run.  Essentially swaps a Tellarknight on field with a Tellarknight in deck, which is useful if we need to get some advantage from a monster about to be destroyed <em>or</em> if we draw a dead Tellarknight monster and want something more useful.  Just remember you're locked into summoning Tellarknight monsters for that turn.  Could be shaved/replaced for some of the other cards in the ""Things I've Been Messing With"" section.  The Link Monsters - Gravity Controller is here to get rid of a monster stuck in the extra monster zone (usually a Pendulum Summoned monster), clearing it out for another Pendulum Summon if need be.  It doesn't come up every game, but you'll definitely love the card when it does come up.  I:P, Unicorn, and Borrelsword are good value cards/finishers in the deck, and are easy to make since we can spam lots of monsters.  Abyss Dweller, Bagooska, and Gallant Granite - These are just good XYZ monsters for the deck.  Dweller is a floodgate and really hurts some decks, Bagooska buys us time if we brick, and Granite can search up Zefraath.  <span><em>LINES OF PLAY</em></span>  There aren't really any set combos in the traditional sense here; rather, the deck is consistently trying to get to certain end goals.  Whichever way you do that is dependent on what's in your hand.  Usually, you want to get you Scales set up and have some sort of play for next turn.  So for example, take the following hand: [Deneb, Zefrathuban, Providence, Ash Blossom, and Alsham].  If we are going first, we could search Oracle with Providence, play Oracle, grab Zefraath, activate Zefraath and Zefrathuban in the Scales, activate Zefraath sending Zefraniu, Pendulum Summon Zefraniu and Deneb, search with Zefraniu and Deneb, grab Nine Pillars and Altair, Normal Summon Alsham, burn for 1000 then XYZ summon Bagooska or Dweller.  If we are going second, we could search Oracle with Providence, play Oracle, grab Zefraath, activate Zefraath and Zefrathuban in the Scales, activate Zefraath sending Zefraxciton, Pendulum Summon Zefraxciton and Deneb, grab Altair, Normal Summon Alsham, burn for 1000 then XYZ summon Triverr, bouncing the field and giving us a second Oracle activation next turn in addition to Altair as a follow-up.  In both these examples, the important thing was setting the Scales - you usually want to do this if you can.  However, after this, we had a lot of branching pathways to get to different end boards depending on what we want to end our turn on.  This high degree of searchability is one of the strengths of the deck.  <span><em>THINGS I'VE BEEN MESSING WITH:</em></span>  To date, I've been playing around with some different packages/techs for the deck:  Utopia Package:  This is Number 39: Utopia, Number 39: Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing.  This is an alternate finisher for the deck.  Summon Utopia Double with two materials, then detach a material to add Double or Nothing from deck to hand and special Utopia onto Utopia Double, doubling Utopia's attack.  Then, you attack a monster with Utopia (since you can't attack directly due to Utopia Double's effect), negate the attack with Utopia, activate Double or Nothing, then attack again for massive damage.  I cut this due to lack of room in the extra deck, but it is a fun combo that I may try again later in the future.  King of the Sky Prison:  This is the addition of King of the Sky Prison and 2 Call of the Haunted.  Essentially, you go into Gallant Granite to search King, activate King, then pass the turn.  On the opponent's turn, you activate a Set card (usually Nine Pillars or Divine Strike), Special Summon King, then Set <em>any</em> extender/searcher you may need from the deck for next turn.  If you go into Triverr next turn, you can bounce the King and do it again next turn!  This one is pretty fun to pull off.  <span><em>CLOSING REMARKS:</em></span>  Hopefully this guide gives you a decent look into playing this deck.  As I've said before, it's not the most competitive deck out there, but it's really fun to play and is surprisingly more resilient than you might expect.  Thanks for taking a look at my build, and good luck with your duels!"

You can also change to 1x silent boost having two is just in case you draw one (u need them in your deck for the effect of phantom knight rusty)  not so many key cards in this deck, you can pull crazy field wipes with pretty much anything but best ones are:  -strangle lanius : If you can, DONT use him at all in any of the early links or xyz summons try and keep him on the field to use his special Summon effect later.  -mimicry : to search for whats missing so you can carry on the flood summon or readiness( this deck lets you get ur main cards to combo all most always ) pretty much a raptors nest ( i recommend to search for a pain lanius because you cannot search summon him with the links or xyz effects once you start to combo)  Combo best hand to open with going 2nd:  1x (trap monster) shade of brigandine,  1x strangle lanius, 1x pain lanius, 1x caligo claw, 1x tribute lanius and u can pretty much have any other card  4                                               2                        4                                       4  you would set then summon your trap shade of brigandine, special summon caligo, strangle lanius , normal summon tribute lanius activate his effect to send mimicry to GY activate mimicry to search for singing lanius, use pain lanius and caligo to link into Rr-wise trix his effect will activate to special summon, Choose raiders wing his effect is negated for now.  link2  4                                             4                                       4negated  Use raiders wing and [ tribute lanius] to xyz in to Rr-force trix, activate his effect detach RAIDERS WING  to add lv4 to hand choose what ever you  want all ready got em all, wise trix affect activates choose rank-up soul shave to set, activate raiders wing in the GY to special summon using the material on force trix, then special summon singing lanius from hand.  link2  rank4                                        4                                        4                                        4  Use link 2 and rank 4 to Link into Phantom knight rusty and if you can choose where to place plz pick the left (dont be braindead) activate rusty's affect to send silent boost to GY ; which will let you add a phantom knight spell/trap (choose trap monster  if you didnt  open with his affect at the starting) choose rank-up magic force, then you can banish silent boost to do the same, choose magic launch( if you chose the trap the 1st time chose magic force the 2nd). Activate rank-upasuru soul shave on force trix (obviously) to xyz out lv6 revolution falcon(dont be braindead put him in a link zone) rustry's effect will activate to let you destroy any card on the field go for back rows to bait any negates or continues trap/spells, then use revolution falcon to destroy 1 enemy monster.  link3  rank6                                         4                                          4                                      4  If hes back row decking use rank upsuru magic force to xyz into satellite falcon wipe entire back row it CANNOT BE NEGATED and they cant activate any card effect  lol cry kid, u can now activate strangle lanius to special summon from the GY just choose mimicry, now u can use mimicry and strangle lanius to xyz into either  - blaze falcon to wipe all enemy special summoned monsters if you cannot otk with arc rebellion  -arc rebellion to big ppk and negate face up monster affects  If they have a big pp beat down monster before activating arc rebellion , using the last two lv4s link into verte and bring out the cancer kid destroyer dragun and destroy his big pp beat stick with his effect, then you can activate arc rebell to destroy him for 11,100 LOL ,if he has a 3000 - 5000k beat down activate satellite cannon to remove 800 atk points for every raidraptor in Gy LOLOLOL about 4000k LOLOL( arc rebellions affect is increased from the ORIGINAL DAMAGE of all special summoned)  link3 rusty  rank8 satellite                       link2 verte                     rank5 arc Reb                      lv8dragun  If you chose to special summon balze falcon even after going verte into dragun you have more than enough to end it 9100 total atk.  if hes got beat down stick that cannot be targeted by card effects, xyz into ultimate falcon ([unaffected by other card effects] which lets his effects work on things like chaos max or dragun etc)  this is only a friendly fun ez to use flood deck, problems i get into is GY negates and  apollousa theres so many searches and special summons it doesnt even affect the flow most of the time .  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The Dogmatika engine is simple and effective and brings nice synergies with the archetype because as you use <a data-name=""Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la"">Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</a> then you can simply send an <a data-name=""Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny"">Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny</a> to the gy and use it as a removal opponent's cards even if you don't control any Evil★Twin monster. It's also because of the Dogma engine that I've decreased the number of Link-2 Evil★Twin in the extra deck. On other decklist choices: What do I think of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>? Crossout is a bad vibes card in the sense that it does the same thing as <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> but worse for the need to use targets that need to be in your deck and I believe that not any deck can use it because it benefits a lot decks that have room for multiple tech cards like this one but not decks that have a very small space so it's better to focus on using other cards. Speaking of main deck targets, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> is the main one because there are no ways to play around it with this archetype and only use 1-off because Nibiru conflicts with Evil★Twin's and this problem has already cost me games so I don't find one Very good card to use and I already have two bricks which are the main deck Evil★Twins and <a data-name=""Fleurdelis"">Fleurdelis</a> and I don't want this number to increase. Another caveat I want to make is the use of <a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a> because it is a budget option for the <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> but if you have the Droplet I recommend using it without thinking twice because it excels in this deck and makes your Crossout Designator much better . About the extra deck I see that many players don't use <a data-name=""Sky Cavalry Centaurea"">Sky Cavalry Centaurea</a> but rather the <a data-name=""Gachi Gachi Gantetsu"">Gachi Gachi Gantetsu</a> and I think its use is due to a budget option because Sky Cavalry is much better in the role of accessing <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> by the factor of be able to bounce an opponent's monster in the battle phase and there are monsters like <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin"">Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</a> that you don't want to send to the GY at all, but banish or return to the extra deck. Another card that is not used much is the <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh </a>which in this version has the fundamental role of versus Tri-Brigade you have the Normal Summon of a Live☆Twin Ki-sikil for example denied and then you do Linguriboh to negate the <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a> and then Next you activate <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to clear the rest of the opponent's field. Regarding the Side Deck one change I would make would be to use <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package. Regarding spell/trap removal I like the 7 used and <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is justified in this deck because you have very easy access to AA-Zeus of 4 materials so you will hardly get punished for using Red Reboot and not getting all of your opponent's traps of field. These are all the ideas I bring with this decklist for you to make changes."

If i sp summon Ascended/Armed sage and normal summon Alisteir and the opponent negate the eff of Alisteir then i summon utopia double, the opponent use negate eff again but i chain with utopia double. If i used Ascended sage then i summon number 39, after c39 and then dragner. If i used Armed sage then i summon directly utopia leo ray if the opponent use negate effect for 3rd time in same turn then i can summon utopia lightning or wait the perfect moment (maybe bp) in his turn (utopia double quick eff) to summon utopia dragonic. If there is no negates and he use just nibiro against me, after nibiro resolves i can summon Mechaba. So i will have mechaba and token with crazy atk. This strategy can work against the most common cards such as veiller, impermanence, nibiro, etc...  With onomatopaira and Ascended/Armed sage i can end on board: -If he use 1 negate against me then my board will be with ascended sage: dragner ,leo utopia ray, abyss dweller and in his turn i will summon number 22 or 41. -if he use 2 negates then my board is: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if he use 3 negates: my board: utopia double + Zubababancho and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonic (i can use the eff of bancho the next turn if he is still alive also). -if i used armed sage instead ascended sage, for 1 negate: dragner (i prefer to summon directly leo but i mention it because u can summon both dragner and leo), leo utopia ray, abyss dweller . -for 2 negates: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -for 3 negates: utopia double + Zubababancho (i can use the eff the next turn) and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if i want to play safe and avoid nibiro i will just summon Ascended/Armed sage + Utopic Onomatopoeia and then utopia double and then directly utopia leo ray and the next turn i will have follow ups in my hand.  Why i use number 101? -if i am in bad position and i need to clear the field but the opponent is with monster 3000atk+ then i use number 101, i attack and i use the eff to stay alive, then i summon Zeus and i clear the field. Number 101 is helpful in many situations.  BRICKS (pegasus, double or nothing) SOLUTIONS: -Double or nothing: go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado. -Pegasus: use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects. -If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal  because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand. -Note: if u are second, in every case try to attack with number 39 (+ double or nothing) and win the duel.  -The deck is good going first/second also. -If u going first u have chance to open Aleister, Meltdown, Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup: 85% + pots = 92%. -If u going first u have chance to open Astral kuriboh, Ascended/Armed sage (+searchers): 82% +pots = 90% -if u going second and the opponent have a very strong board, u can destroy that board by forbiden dropplet + dark ruler and u can give him a hard time with Forbidden Chalice: 71% chance to open + pots = 85%  &nbsp;"

This framework of deck aims to use the upcoming branded fusion engine to ea","This deck is a work in progress to test the branded fusion with Witchcrafters; this will probably not be meta relevant in the slightest, so if you are interested in a more pure variant of the build I uploaded one earlier in December. For this reason also, the ratios may not be the most optimal and I'm happy to hear any feedback on this build in the hopes of improving this build once it arrives in the TCG.  <hr />  <strong>Choice of cards in the main deck explained: </strong>  <strong>-A lot of Spellcasters</strong>, literally half the deck (20/40) consists of spellcasters including the handtraps.  <span>10x Witchcrafter monster cards (I go more in depth with them in my pure build #shameless_plugin)  +  8x Witchcrafter spell cards. </span>  <span>Good hands are when you <strong>don't</strong> open Haine and Verre, lucking illusion of chaos the new inclusion can fix your hand while also providing you with a starter. </span>The most ideal opening start would be to open the <a data-name=""Branded Fusion""><strong>Branded Fusion</strong>, this card would fusion summon </a><a data-name=""Albion the branded dragon""><strong>Albion the branded dragon</strong> which on summon can allow you to fusion summon </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Vice-master ""><strong>Witchcrafter Vice-master</strong> by banishing the required material from GY/hand or field. To summon Albion, you send </a><em><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> + 1 Light monster</em>, by sending a light Witchcrafter you can satisfy 1/2 the required materials for Vice-master. Once Vice-master is on the field, you can activate its effects and setup your field, the only restriction the Branded Fusion causes is not allowing you to special summon from the Extra Deck except Fusions, so nothing too harsh. Ideally you want to end your board with either <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine""><strong>Witchcrafter Haine</strong> as your (psuedo-Drident) and/or </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Madame Verre""><strong>Witchcrafter Madame Verre</strong> for disruption. </a>  <strong>-Ash blossom&amp; joyous spring</strong>, as a hand-trap, remains the most popular option of choice for its versatility, but I choose to cut for both <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Effect Veiler&quot;&gt;Effect Veiler&lt;/a&gt; and Droll &amp; Lock Bird""> and </a><strong><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a></strong> as viable options, especially in the current meta; they also are favored for being spellcasters. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psy-Framegear Gamma&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psy-Framegear Gamma</strong></a> <strong>+ <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a></strong><a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver""> are in the deck to make sure your spells go through and the activated effects of the Witchcrafters card are not negated. In case of a disruption on your turn, we have a single copy of <strong>Called by the grave</strong> and 2 copies of </a><strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent </a></strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">for recovery and follow-up.</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">-Magicians' Souls </a></strong>+ <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos""><strong>Illusion of Chaos</strong>, are a compact package that allows you to thin the deck/fix your hand/and draw cards with souls, this engine can be made more consistent with the inclusion of </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Preparation of Rites&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Preparation of Rites</strong></a>. [<em>Beginner Tip: Illusion of chaos can place itself on the top of the deck in a pinch, but keep in mind once you special summon souls, you send from deck to GY and then <strong>shuffle</strong>.</em>]  That should make the main deck clear, honestly learning to play well with the Witchcrafter portion of the deck is probably the most important thing for its success, just to give you the main idea, you want to <em><strong>blink</strong></em> from any <strong>Witchcrafter</strong> &gt; <strong><a data-name=""Schmietta"">Schmietta</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Genni"">Genni &gt; </a></strong><a data-name=""Genni"">ending on either </a><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine </a></strong><a data-name=""Genni"">or </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Madame Verre"">Witchcrafter Madame Verre. In the GY, </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;chmietta&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chmietta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;""><strong>S</strong></a><a data-name=""chmietta""><strong>chmietta</strong></a><a data-name=""chmietta""> can send any Witchcrafter spell card for </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Genni&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Genni</strong> </a>to copy its effect: <strong>[</strong><em>Best card to use with Genni in GY is  <strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter confusion"">Witchcrafter confusion</a></strong> for a fusion summon/ <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Witchcrafter Holiday&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Witchcrafter Holiday</strong></a> for recovery / <strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter creation"">Witchcrafter Creation</a></strong> to fetch <strong><a data-name=""Golem Aruru"">Golem Aruru</a></strong></em> to hand for disruption<strong>]</strong>. If only Schmietta is in grave the best thing to probably send by its GY effect is probably <strong><a data-name=""Bystreet"">Bystreet</a>, </strong>for protection. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Draping&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Draping</strong></a> is for specifically countering <strong><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, </strong>but it can be used for multiple other targets that may come up.  <hr />  <span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <strong>-Fusion</strong> <strong>line-up:</strong> of <strong>6</strong> <strong><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> <em>fusion targets</em> and 2 of the <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;vice-master&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>vice-master</strong></a> herself, the ratios can be adjusted and experimented with this is what I am comfortably running currently. Albion the Branded dragon is what you summon off of branded fusion going first, as this almost always guarantees successfully summoning vice-master. If you feel like high rolling, <strong>Lubellion the Searing Dragon </strong>is your target by sending Haine/Illusion of Chaos and Albaz to GY, activate <strong><a data-name=""Lubellion"">Lubellion</a></strong>'s on summon effect to discard one LIGHT monster from hand specifically to special summon <strong>Albion the Branded </strong>which will banish the Haine and Albaz to give you <strong>Vice-master, </strong>and ending with 3 monsters on field. [<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> you are locked from summoning from the Extra deck only fusion monsters.]</em>  <strong>-1 level 8 synchro monster: </strong>this can basically be any monster as it seldom comes up, but the theory behind <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psy-framelord Omega&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong></a> is that it allows you recover your banished cards. The only way to make this monster is with Gamma + Driver, but you maybe don't wanna make a synchro summon at all as it conflicts with Branded Fusion's summoning condition.  <strong>-Link line-up: </strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Artemis, the magistus"">Artemis, the Magistus </a></strong><a data-name=""Artemis, the magistus"">allows you to send any Witchcrafter normal summon to the grave when you want to activate their graveyard effects but don't want to ditch a spell, that is basically the limit of its function.</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a></strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">is an auto inclusion to most decks that fusion summon these days, however we are not using it nefariously to summon DPE or Dragoon, but to access Vice-masters by using either </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter confusion"">Witchcrafter confusion</a> or <a data-name=""Magicalized fusion"">Magicalized fusion</a>. <strong>Branded fusion</strong> is a terrible option with this monster as you can't special summon at all afterwards. This monster is also very helpful with <strong>Super polymerization.</strong>  <b><a data-name=""Lambda"">Lambda</a>, </b>is to allow you to use Psy-Framegear gamma in hand when you have an already established field consisting of monsters.  <b><a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Selene"">Selene</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Accesscode talker"">Accesscode talker</a> OTK. </b>This combo can be made with any 2 monsters including a tuner, currently only effect Veiler but you can steal a tuner with Triple tactics talents if needed, this allows you summon effect veiler from deck and then link climb into a link-3 Selene, that special summons the same effect veiler from GY or any spellcasters you have really; Link climb again into Accesscode talker with 5300 attack and 2 pops on the field. <em><strong>[</strong>Tip: Accesscoder made this way will have 5300 atk + 2700 atk that vice-master has will = 8000 LP<strong>]</strong> GG EZ.</em>  <hr />  <span><strong>Side deck options for going second:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark ruler no more"">Dark ruler no more</a></li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Super polymerization"">Super polymerization</a> + at least 2 targets</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, the rock</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Harpie's feather duster"">Harpie's feather duster</a></li>  	<li>1x Magician's Left Hand/ Magician's Right Hand [tip: these cards can stop super-poly/dark ruler no more/evenly match]</li>  	<li>1x Rank-8 of choice</li> </ul>  <hr />  <strong>PROS:</strong>  The branded engine adds consistency and power, while the pure variant plays a slower control style of build, this deck is more aggressive and combo oriented. Illusion of chaos is basically additional copies of magicains' souls which almost always found place in the deck. Going second, people have few answers to super polymerization and dark ruler no more, essentially you can go for an OTK almost all the time. The playstyle of the deck is essentially vice-master turbo, the card is a house, it's function is to stop your opponent from making a board to counter yours, Haine supports vice-master by target protection, Golem Aruru protects it from battle, and bystreet protects it from destruction. The rest of the tools in the deck are for consistency and to ensure you end on Vice-master.  <strong>CONS:</strong>  This deck relies heavily on vice-master which in itself, lacks built-in protection and negates. Also it losses heavily to the sideboard. Even though Albaz adds a lot to the deck, it is much more stronger in other decks that build powerful turn one negates. Witchcrafters, even though I love them a lot, minus a lot with their current mechanic; which while it is interesting playstyle, stops it from ever reaching meta status."

The Tellarknight archetype is build to mainly counter Dark and 9/10 times should be winning that matchup, the only Dark deck in the meta right now that would be a bit of a grind game would be against PK. Non dark decks are not hard to out but it but it becomes more of a game of timing also Anaconda isn't just a pay 2000 to special summon using its effect to make one of your opponents cards dark is really strong and opens up super poly plays. The DPE engine helps speed up the deck Dasher allows you to be able to special summon a Teller during the draw phase and Celestial allows you to go +2 in the standby phase after using Dasher while DPE helps you put more pressure on your opponent. The side deck is build to out meta and non dark decks the small Artifact engine can apply a lot of pressure on your opponent as you play traps in the deck and they are going to side things to hit your traps and if they hit a Artifact you gain even more advantage. any questions just common and ill try to answer them asap."

The concept is somewhat borrowed from Cardfight! Vanguard in that its a monster that remains on the board at all times and represents the player.  &nbsp;  This is designed to be a multi-man format (akin to Commander in MTG), hence why i have cards like The Forceful Sentry and Painful Choice allowed despite otherwise being banned in the OCG and TCG since i feel like they do a good job of encouraging negotiations between different players since you have to first designate which opponent you'll use a card's effect on in 3+ man games.  &nbsp;  When selecting the monsters for your main deck, you can only pick monsters that share either the same attribute and/or the same monster type as your vanguard. For example, i can put any dark and/or cyberse monsters in the main deck because Suppression Collider is a dark cyberse monster."

The most common play to make with the field spell and a Springans monster in hand is to activate Gold Golgonda, pitch the Springans monster, summon Merrymaker and depending on what you pitched with Gold Golgonda the combo can branch out:  Branga <ul>  	<li>Send anything other that Branga to GY with Merrymaker</li>  	<li>Activate Branga effect in GY banishing both Springan's monsters</li>  	<li>Search Interluder or Blast as an interruption</li> </ul> Captain Sargus <ul>  	<li>Send Brothers to GY with Merrymaker</li>  	<li>Activate Brothers to Summon Captain Sargus from GY</li>  	<li>Activate Brothers to attach it as material to Merrymaker, giving Sargus a pop on your opponents turn</li> </ul> DPE is is a little more reliable than Mirrorjade at times because, going second you will most likely use Mirrorjade's banish effect which means it is just a body on your oppoenets turn. In comparison DPE can always pop cards. The advantage Mirrorjade has is its ability to send Albion from the Extra Deck to the GY to search Judgement of Stigmata or sending Sprind the Irondash Dragon which allows you search or summon a Springans or Fallen of Albaz.  The deck is fully equip to go second. It features 8 hand traps. Ash and Impermanence are a must in my opinion. If you fix some of the ratios, Gamma fits well into the deck because the Springans XYZ can banish themselves on your opponents turn, leaving you with no monsters on the field which allows you to activate Gamma. Ghost Ogre can be replaced by Veiler. They are both Light meaning they can be used to summon Albion if that situation ever occurs. I chose Ghost Ogre because although it doesn't negate, it takes bodies off the field and it is useful against field spells which tend to generate advantage. Fallen of Albaz is great going second because it forces your opponent to make a decision which can bait out negates or handtraps. Furthermore, its basically the only normal summon in a deck that isn't reliant on the normal summon, so it being negated doesn't cripple the strategy. Lastly, Exblowrer is great going second if you can get material under it.  &nbsp;"

It is undeniable that the deck has come a long way - even becoming playable occasionally. Common Charity will have a good amount of competent decks that gatekeep the format - some with surprising capabilities. I believe some variation of this build of Gren Maju can keep up with the likes of ""Towers"" strategies (often midrange decks that ""turbo"" unaffected monsters with threatening stats) and control strategies, as well as assert dominance over other agro strategies (this deck's forte)  DECK STRATEGY  Many consider Gren Maju to be an OTK deck. Some play it as a stun variant. I Myself view Gren as a Midrange/Control Deck which incidentally can OTK, and have played it this way since Eater Of Millions became legal in the TCG. I personally feel that Gren is best suited for explosive plays, aiming to break the opponent's board (or hard-punish them for not building one on Turn 0). Gren, played in this manner, seeks to accomplish the following win condition against competent decks: <ol>  	<li>Force the opponent rapidly deplete resources in the first turn(s) by mass removal and/or insane attack pressure</li>  	<li>Win in the mid-game by having higher-quality threats than the opponent</li> </ol> PROS <ul>  	<li>Gren Maju decks, if tuned properly, can reasonably break any board and have decent OTK potential.</li>  	<li>This particular build blanks opposing spell/trap removal (pre sideboard), as it has no reliance on continuous backrow or field spells.</li>  	<li>Played skillfully, Gren Maju also provides opportunity for technical plays that exploit the mechanical limitations of some other kinds of decks.</li> </ul> CONS <ul>  	<li>Gren Maju is inherently weak to backrow. This is offset by mass removal like Lightning storm in Advanced Format, but this weakness is pronounced in Common Charity.</li>  	<li>Gren is traditionally unable to grind at a high tempo, leaving it at a disadvantage to highly recursive decks - specifically decks that can recur removal.</li>  	<li>Gren Maju is at a huge disadvantage when hand size is low - despite sometimes insane top-deck draws.</li>  	<li>Gren must have a plan in the side deck to go 1st if forced to do so during a match</li> </ul> The biggest drawback of Gren Maju is related skill/deck-building. First of all, the deck MUST be tuned to a particular meta to be consistently effective against competent decks. This is true for any Rouge Deck. While Gren Maju Decks are fairly intuitive to play, effective deckbuilding is what enables their success. Lastly, you must be very knowledgeable about the rules of the game to be baseline effective at this deck, let alone boast a winning record on a competitive level.  MAIN DECK - MONSTERS  3x Gren Maju Da Eiza  Less ""OTK boi"" and more Removal Through Attacking and lightning-rod for certain negates and removal. Incidentally, sometimes it will result in your opponent's life points being reduced to 0, which is an added bonus. Biggest drawback to Gren is that he is not a 1-Card-Combo... He Needs an enabler to banish cards, which reduces the consistency of this deck. Nonetheless, the upsides far outweighs the downside, and its good enough to name the deck after it...  &nbsp;  3x Eater Of Millions  Depending on the Matchup, the Removal that Eater provides ranges from highly effective to just ok. This card does serve as a secondary Gren Maju, both in terms of removal through attacking and winning through damage output.  &nbsp;  3x Necroface  A tertiary Gren Maju, again serving as removal through attacking and winning through damage output. HOWEVER, this is a ""non-bo"" with Gren while, as well as a conflicting Normal Summon. These drawbacks are balanced with this card's synery with gold sarcophagus and enabling you to grind (sometimes indefinately). Normal Summoning Necroface may result in continued plays with Gizmek Orochi, pot of desires, etc.  &nbsp;  3x GizMek Orochi, The Serpentine Sky Slasher  Easily the best monster in the deck. It fades battle damage by soaking up an attack or simply ""flashes-in"" on your opponent's end phase, is spell speed 1 monster removal, and has decent stats... All while fueling Gren Maju, Eater, or Necroface. This card's  quick effect to special summon itself is very good, and its ability to destroy a face-up monster is good too (when you have the opportunity to use it).  &nbsp;  3x Divine Serpent Geh.  Easily the Worst Monster in the Deck. It is situational, costs half of your life points to use, and takes a little experience to get the feel for when it is good and what situational synergies it brings to the deck. However, it is untargetable, and can usually get over any monster your opponent controls (as long as they have not gained atk). Furthermore, it negates random things like Flip effects during the damage step when it declares an attack, as well as certain problematic continuous effects of the attack target. This card is usually really good against decks that rely on targeted removal.     In an alternate universe, this card is D. D. Assault Carrier, if that card was actually playable.  &nbsp;  3x Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju  This card enables removing a ""Towers""-like monster from the board. Its the Lowest ATK Kaiju at common rarity, and is dark too!  1X DinoWrestler Pankratops  A Solid going-2nd card. Serves as removal via attacking or its own effect. The flexibility this card offers is frankly amazing, despite is lack of a dark attribute of level of 8...  &nbsp;  1x Phantom Skyblaster  Often times, this is a 1 card Link 3, which will often serve as a form of targeted monster removal and an attacker. Dark attribute is good too. It is however, the deck's 7th normal summon, which is pushes the boundary for normal summon only monsters a little bit.  &nbsp;  1x Battle Fader  It has dark dynergy and is enables counter-attack plays that can result in victory. It is outclassed by Gizmek Orochi for what it does, however.  MAIN DECK - SPELLS  3x Pot of Desires  A +1 in card advantage whose cost synergizes with 9 of our monsters - auto include  &nbsp;  3x Allure of Darkness  Card advantage neutral, but has has synergy Necroface, serving as a way to rip apart your opponents deck and eventually boost Gren (or another Necroface). We play 17 dark monsters, to it is sometimes viable to activate this card with no dark monsters In hand, and is rarely dead otherwise.  &nbsp;  3x Forbidden Chalice  One of the best cards in the deck. Since we kind of want the opponent to go off on Turn 0, we don't mind too much on mission out on playing Effect Veiler instead. This card also enables some combat tricks, allowing a Gizmek Orochi to attack over a Radian, a Necroface to get over a boss monster, etc. Also, on the off-chance that magic cylinder is a great card in Common Charity format, this can very well save you from your own Gren... Also good in the mirror (should that ever be a thing you encounter)  &nbsp;  3x Dark Hole  The expectation is never for this card to lead to an OTK, but is is a very good way to punish out opponents for not setting up a solid board Turn 0. Occasionally, this may blow your opponent out, but most of the time, against competent decks, this card will be part of the sequence of plays you make to attrite your opponent into the ground by the mid game.  &nbsp;  1x Monster Reborn  This card enables all sorts of situational plays. It is arguable that Upstart Goblin is better in this slot.  &nbsp;  1x Gold Sarcophagus  In a long game, ensuring that you see a Necroface eventually, can be the difference between winning and losing. Occasionally can lead to banishing some good stuff out of your opponent's deck via this play. Can also get any card in the deck if you figure it'll be good in 2 turns.  &nbsp;  1x Called by the Grave  We want to have offensive turns with this deck, relying on activated abilities of monsters and spells. This card is good at protecting against hand traps, as well as disrupting resources in the opponent's GY.  &nbsp;  1x Foolish Burial  Basically Gizmek Orochi #4. If ever make a rank 8 XYZ with this build, if will probably involve this card.  &nbsp;  MAIN DECK - TRAPS  3x Typhoon  Admittedly, this card is not as good as twin twisters of Cosmic Cyclone - or even MST in some cases. However, I don't this deck is well suited for Twin Twisters (despite Gizmek synergy), and snake-boi Divine Serpent Geh will likely cost us 4000 Life Points for its first activation, adding some risk to Cosmic Cyclone that i'd personally rather avoid. Really, this is a symptom of the bigger issue here: there are not enough playable level 8s for this deck. We would happily leave Geh behind for a competent level 8 - then we could even dump some of the sacky spell cards for Trade In!  Spells enable this deck to function. Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order will prevent us from breaking a well set up board time and time again. Typhoon will always out those cards, and has situational advantages against field spell decks.  Cosmic Cyclone is in the Side deck if you really need it.  EXTRA DECK  3x Linkuriboh  You can make this card with Eater when situations come up where that is advantageous, so try to always leave 1 in your extra deck during gameplay. You can also make this with Battle Fader  &nbsp;  3x Ra'Ten, The Heavenly General  Phantom Skyblaster goes into this card, and then you blow something up with it. 2 of these copies are banish fodder. This card allows you to target and destroy a card at the start of the battle phase,  &nbsp;  3x Steel Star Regulator  An Objectively Worse Ra'Ten. Banish Fodder  &nbsp;  3x Number 62: Galaxy Eyes Prime Photon Dragon  Can get up to 5600 atk on its own and can serve as a situational out to certain cards, if ypou can make this rank 8 play  3x Aegaion The Sea Castum  We need to banish something from the extra deck to summon Eater of Millions and it might as well be this. Can serve as a situational wall/removal, and if your opponent's extra deck is running out you might hit a payoff... or something.  SIDE DECK  1x Macro Cosmos &amp; Dimensional Fissure  If you're going to be forced to go 1st, might as well play cards that make your deck better (despite lost Gizmek Value), and probably make your opponent's deck much worse.  &nbsp;  2x Trap Trick  If your going to go 1st, might as well have 2 more copies of Torrential Tribute and Banquet of Millions in your Deck  &nbsp;  3x Torrential Tribute  One of the best traps in the game and right in line with the deck's plan to induce resource depletion for the opponent. Just know your matchups so you know when to use it.  &nbsp;  2x Banquet of Millions  If forced to go 1st when wen don't want to, this matchup dependent card can ensure that we see out next turn, at which point our gameplan resumes as normal.  &nbsp;  2x Dark Ruler No More  When you know you want to go 2nd and the matchup will inevitably be a grind, or you know that your opponent's board will be very difficult to break.  &nbsp;  3x Cosmic Syslone  Useful for whenever Typoon alone is insufficient.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  HOT TAKES  TRADE IN  So Close... If you're willing to play Schwartzchild Limit Dragon and perhaps another lv 8, you can replace Divine Serpent Geh and some spells for lv8s and some number of Trade Ins. Right now, I think Gizmek Orochi is the only Level 8 worth playing, which is a shame. Gren can't afford to sit with a dead Trade In in hand, and you don't need the ordeal of trading an optimal Gizmek play on your opponent's turn for that pseudo +1 from pitching it with trade In. We just need more playable lv8s. Of course, you do you... I'm Projecting here.  POT OF DUALITY  Not for me... I've never liked this card in Gren. I think Gren plays a sub-optimal stun strategy, and losing your ability to have a maximally explosive turn at any point in the game seems like an anit-synergy to me. I'd rather run something like Upstart Goblin and just hope I banish it every time..."

If the crossouts, and or ash blossom is to expensive add cards like twin twisters, or effect veiler, same with any other hand traps. IF you can not afford an accescode talker than you can add borrelsword, or borreload depending on your budget."

Tyrannical Dong Ying can search a Spell/Trap, or a Level 7 or higher Ancient Warriors monster. Defying The Warlord's Demands lets you special summon an Ancient Warriors monster, then burns you for 100 Life Points x that monster's Level.  &nbsp;  This deck can either go first or second. If you're going first, your goal is either to end on Double Dragons, Dong Ying, and Lu Feng for at least 2 disruptions. If you're going second, your goal is to summon as many big beaters into you can and pummel your opponent into submission.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The next thing is to prevent the opponent from activating his effects with the quick effect of <strong>Rexsturm</strong> and thus be able to summon other Dinorphia Fusion as the situation warrants.  After having spoiled the enemy's plans, on your next turn you will then be able to summon several Dinorphia or lv4 dinosaur monsters again to be able to do XYZ summoning to monsters that will allow you to finish off with the enemy's monsters (for example: AA-ZEUS)"

Has 3 different options for 1st turn boards that can counter pretty much any deck. for example going blind you would want to use apex since its an omni negate that can stop cards like forbidden droplet lightning storm and other 2nd turn cards going against trap based decks eldlich, altergeist, dogmatika and more you would want to side dark simorgh to lock them out of setting cards and barrier statue for decks that like to spam special summons for example @ignisters and Sunavalon it can easily play through handtraps and end on a strong board and is one of the only decks that actually benefit from siding and using strategy."

Summon loads of level 2 beast type monsters (how to should be pretty obvious if you test draw about 3 times) if you can, if not you set up a way to trigger card effects to summon them in your opponents turn. Preferably summon 2 Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu on your first turn (pro tip, put one in the extra monster zone, because your field will get very full.) use both of their effects to summon the tokens. Both Sandayu's are going to be immune except from effects that return them to the hand (Extra deck in this case) or banish them.

This deck gives it all when going 2nd, thanks to the multiple going 2nd options (Chalice, Imperm, Nibiru, DRNM) and also cards like Faris, Destiny fusion, and even adusted gold, which are perfect extenders in case they still manage to stop you.  Fusion destiny is obviously ur strongest card in the whole deck, allowing you to one-card combo Destiny hero Phoenix Enforcer and Plasma.  Unfortunately, the weakness of the deck is always the same: Nibiru.  You can play crossout in the main without any problems, but I do prefer to have it in my side.  While going first, you have multiple ways to play around things like Imperm and Effect veiler, thanks to Mask change and Increase, it's quite hard to stop you because usually, one or two hand-trap aren't enough, or u simply don't care thanks to mask-change/increase.  Always try to make Dark law when possible, even if it's luck-based (if u don't draw mask change u basically can't do Dark law if u want to search it by using liquid to revive shadow mist, u still lose a lot just for dark law)."

The only thing different is the inclusion of crossout designator which is just here to help insure that your opening combo goes as planned, since it is crucial with only one meow meow mew.  <strong>Tips:</strong> If you are new to this deck I highly suggest you check out youtube to learn about the deck, the combo is not very straightforward and if you do not know what you are doing you will get very frustrated with this deck. Do not shuffle back the meow meow mew unless your opening combo doesn't work, the meow meow mew lets you battle butler 2 times. Reading the cards and understanding how they work will help you out a lot when learning to play any deck, prank kids is a deck that you really need to do that first with.  <strong>Budget options:</strong>If you can not afford the crossout designators, or the Triple tactics talents, then I suggest replacing them with cheaper hand traps or good cards, such as artifact lancea, twin twister, and other good cards. If you can not afford verte annoconda then that can be replaced by any good generic link monsters, such as knightmare Cerberus, A spirit charmer link monster, or even psy framegear lamda, if you are going to play the psy frame package. If you cannot afford a accesscode talker than I recomend borrelsword, or borreload dragon."

You can put any 15 cards in extra decks ","Hi, this deck is built around getting on the field mystic mine (through various spells in the deck) and then drawing and searching through your entire deck through card effects. Apart from the 5 exodia pieces, the only monster is cardcar D and the deck majority is spells. Apart from mystic mine, there are other lockdown and stall cards. The extra deck's only purpose is with pot of extravagance so you could put any 15 cards you want in it. There is no side deck since this card is not very good in matches. This is my first deck uploading so I hope u enjoy :)."

The fact that most level 8's search virtually the whole archetype makes this shockingly consistent (we're talking virtually every single game).  Standard Going First Combo: <ol>  	<li>Summon Sharakusai and use its effect with the 1 other punk monster you have in hand or on field to summon Carp Rising</li>  	<li> Activate Carp Rising to summon Dia Note and Madame Spider from deck</li>  	<li>Madame Spider effect to search a Punk Trap from deck (usually Dangerous Gabu if you don't draw it)</li>  	<li>Synchro into Madame Spider and Dia Note into Dragite</li>  	<li>Dia Note effect to summon back Sharakusai in defence mode</li> </ol> End Board: <ol>  	<li>1 spell/trap negate with Dragite since Carp Rising in grave is a water (important to use Dragite because the deck has several monster negates but no spell/trap negations)</li>  	<li>Bounce 3 with Sharakusai effect by synchroing on opponents turn with Dragite to summon Amazing Dragon (bounce 3 since the combo ends with 3 level 3 tuners in grave)</li>  	<li>1 monster negate and life point gain with Dangerous Gabu</li>  	<li>3 to 4 other cards for extending into more synchros or Lambda, follow up, or additional interruptions</li> </ol> Pro Tip: If you can spare an e-tele, don't summon back the Sharakusai at the end of the combo so you can avoid Nibiru (you would be at 4 summons at that point). Then set the e-tele and use it on your opponents turn to summon another Sharakusai from deck to pull off the same 3 card bounce with Amazing Dragon.

Leo is a great distraction, and a huge body. You will OTK in the right conditions with Tris clearing field. double dragon can send Imperial away if you aren't feeling it. You will need to set up GY with kaleido early to have the materials in GY for Wolf to banish. This is mostly a tri build but with a twist. Going first you want to go into apollousa with kerass special summon, make sure you fill GY. Rescue cat can summon either Joyous going first with omen as bait for banishes or Herald for negates with apollousa by special summoning Hop Ear."

Valhalla+Thunder painter is full combo with thunder painter being able to send Valhalla to the gy for snow canvas which can be used to search for the field spell. The field spell is easily the best weather painter card allowing for easy access to the Rainbow painter by using your canvases as link material allowing you to use snow canvases effect to search and then using it as material in the same turn. Having cloud painter on the field at the same time as link summoning your rainbow painter will allow you to return two canvases to the field essentially turning your rainbow into a link 1. The new link 3 moonbow is an option aswell allowing you to summon your banished painters if their effect to return is negated by something like a solemn.

Funny I thought they where extinct. ","This deck has very good synergy, even if you open fusion destiny and a baby you are set. I was not sure about this at first but the destiny heros do not get in the way, and a free disruption is pretty nice. I would make apollousa if you don't have the lost world on the board, but the destroy phoenix enforcer if you do.  <strong>Budget options:</strong> If you can not afford accesscode talker try getting cards like borrelsword dragon, it is a budget alternative.  If you can not afford the destiny hero package than I recommend just cutting the fusion package, making it a going second build with cards like dark ruler no more the rainbow neos package, and other board breaking cards. If you are just playing casually you can also cut the side deck. If you can not afford apollousa I recommend getting number 60, a second dolka, or another good generic rank 4 card for the deck. If you can not get the borreload savage dragon then I recommend changing this to a going second dino deck.  <strong>Going second dino:</strong> If you can not afford some of the more expensive cards than I recommend playing a going second variant. In this variant you will cut the destiny hero package for the rainbow neos package, play 2-3 mystic mine, lightning storm-or raigeki,feather duster, Dark ruler no more, and other board breaking cards.  I will post a going second budget version in the near future."

General strategy is to XYZ Summon Starliege Photon Blast Dragon and Prime Photon Dragon using Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon. Detach in battle phase, and double Prime Photon's already massive ATK points. <h3></h3> <h2>Going First:</h2> If going first, XYZ Summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord and Starliege Photon Blast Dragon (Preferably equipped with Photon Orbital, as this will make your board state very hard to deal with)  &nbsp; <h2>Tips:</h2> in case you fail to do OTK you can also summon C107 or Cipher Drago / Neo Cipher Drago or you can also summon them just to increase Prime Photon Dragon's ATK points."

A assault core, B buster drake, and C crush wyvern all represent the “ABCs” of deck building with monsters, spells, and traps. A assault core represents monsters, it protects the monster it’s equipped to from monster effects, it also is the color orange to resemble the card border for monsters  B buster drake represents spells, it protects a monster it’s equipped to from spell effects and is green which is the spell card border  C crush wyvern is a trap protector and is mostly purple which is the trap border  I just put that together myself and kicked myself for not noticing a long time ago"

This prevents common board breakers like <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>, <strong>Forbidden Chalice</strong>, even <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> from activating OR resolving and essentially prevents your opponent from comboing. If your opponent tries to set up backrow like <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> you can use <strong>Kali Yuga</strong>'s effect to destroy ALL spells and traps on the field so that you can close the game next turn.  This deck excels against combo strategies (if you can go first), but struggles against control strategies. Even with the advantage of being able to destroy backrow, the opponent can simply set <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous</strong> to prevent any <span>OTK</span> (unless you fit in piercing battle damage or other rank 4s that destroy cards).  This deck also does not prevent attacks, so do not be afraid to keep your monsters in Attack Position to prevent any attempt the opponent makes to summon <strong>Divine Arsenal AA Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong> to wipe the field on your own turn (the opponent cannot attack directly with <strong>Zoodiac </strong><strong>Boarbow</strong>, remember it is negated). Your monsters are huge, 3500 and 6000 (<strong>Dragonar</strong> <span>ATK</span> is doubled off of <strong>Utopia Double</strong>), your opponent will be very hard pressed to beat over them unless they play any kind of <strong>Honest</strong>.  Another weakness this deck has is the chance that your opponent plays any form of quick-effect backrow removal, like <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> or <strong>Twin Twisters</strong>. If they attempt to remove your <strong>PKRUM</strong> before their Main Phase, you cannot summon <strong>Kali Yuga</strong>, as <strong>PKRUM</strong> can only activate during the Main Phase. Use <strong>Numbers' Protection</strong>, which is searchable off <strong>Astraltopia</strong>, to stop their attempt. Alternatively, because <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> sees plenty of play, you could play <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong> to prevent banishing for the turn, thereby protecting your <strong>PKRUM</strong>.  Change the monster line up to be any of your favorite level 4s! Change the Extra Deck to help OTK after summoning Kali Yuga! Most of the cards are really cheap, the only expensive cards are Utopia Double itself, and the hand traps and Crossout Designator. Replace these to increase consistency or fill with your own jank. Thanks for reading! Remember to feel the flow and high-five the sky!"

Many cards in this deck either help that happen or hamper the opponent to enable it.  Card's like Desires and Memories of Hope help you draw into things you need, Limiter Removel's for fast OTK's or Handtraps/Destruction/Mine to stall out the opponent until you can OTK. The extra deck is focused on using the one Special summon you get after using the effect of Numeron Calling to get out a good Monster that won't be easy for the opponent to deal with.  If you have a bit more $$$, I'd swap out the Dark Hole, Harpie's, and Upstart with 3x Lightning Storms."

The deck can be cheap if you take out the more expensive cards like prosp, accesscode, zeus, millenium eyes, imperm, and I:P for cheaper alternitives. White howling is a one turn one sided order for water decks witch is really strong. Armory call is metaverse for equip spells, you really want to see sword.

The more powerful cards can be used to protect the Melffy cards long enough to Xyz summon. There are plenty of effect cards, as well as spell/trap cards that can serve this purpose, with a particular spotlight on graveyard retrieval and attack/effect negation. Plus, even if some kind of spell, trap, or monster defense can't be immediately set up, the Melffies can defend themselves for a bit. They can be called back to avoid damage, and the nature of their effects makes collecting a hand of Melffies easy, in addition to the regular draw.  This deck was assembled from cards I've come across card hunting. That is, except the Melffy cards which were purposefully sought out, and a few cards found in the Slifer deck."

The deck is mostly rock monster based, which makes getting out Adamancipator cards to synchro summon fairly easy. Several monsters can summon each other, and the ones that can't either have good damage output or defensive capabilities. I threw in the stardust dragon synchros for backup, and also because they're some of my favorite cards. With a couple tactical-field-wipes and an enemy controller thrown in, this deck makes for a strong contender, at least among me and my friends ^^;  I had to seek out a lot of these cards on tcg, but there are a few in there that are relatively common shuffling through cards at the local card shop."

Ronin is good for OTK, but don't end your starting board on him.  If you can't get 4 monsters in GY, I'd recommend ending on Ancient Warriors as a final effort.  Searching off of Melffy of the Forest for Melffy Puppy. With Shuraig on board, this lets you get a free destroy with Kalantosa, banish off Shuraig, and negate with Forest.  Because Joyous Melffys can attack directly, you can get free Zeus off of that."

It's good going first or second and has many different opening hands. I haven't bricked with it yet, but more testing and I should be able to tell you all more.  This is all before the new Albaz Structure deck comes out too. Awesome fusion and synchro deck."

The idea behind the deck is that Therions are lvl 7 and 8 that allows you to go into lvl 10 and 11 synchros using your PUNKs. I usualy end on Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, a Regulus (or a Therion equipped with it), the PUNK and the Therion trap and a Sharakusai (for synchro during the opponent's turn)  The problem with Therions is that they are kinda bricky if you don't have a way to put ressources in GY first, but PUNK foxy tune is an easy and consistent way to discard a Therions from your hand and start your combos  Noh PUNK Dia Note is amazing and opens synchro 8 plays. Since it's a warrior that has a reborn effect when it leaves the field, it synergizes very well with ""Bulls"" Ein.  Overall, super nice deck, imma test it some more"

Do you like violence drawing 10 cards a turn?  Well have I got the deck for you!  Remember Dragon Rulers using Super Rejuvenation to go +7 in the end phase because they were all dragons that had discard costs built in?  Like 75% of the Dragunity cards use a discard as cost. And you can play 10 Cards of Consonance targets. Which also adds a draw to your SR in end phase.  The optimal board for this deck is Spheres+Areadbhair+Dragunity Oubliette. You get there by using your discards to pack your graveyard full of Phalanx and Couse, then synchro summoning a Barcha and going off from the +3 that gives you.  It doesn't have the strongest boards but it compensates by loading your hand during the end phase, which is why the deck is 1/4 hand traps. Draw one or two and the negate (which banishes btw) and bounce should hold you through most combos, and Oubliette protects you against DRNM/Droplets.  The deck is also chock full of 1 1/2 and 2 card combos so added to the ease of getting to any of your monsters it's extremely consistent.  &nbsp;"

It can be abused to no end with dark monsters that allow you to tribute which is one of the best forms of destruction. This is one of the most unique decks and it is a load of fun to play.

You redo your moves in a cyclic way and forcing interactions with the opponent. Besides how <a data-name=""Snake Rain"">Snake Rain</a> is an absurd card you always send a lot of Ogdoadic monster to the gy in the first game turn and so your deck arrives in turn 3 with 25 cards or less. which greatly improves the top deck of the engine used in conjunction with Ogdoadic. (<a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> + Any Normal Summon) and (<a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> + Any Random Card in Hand) already guarantee you by the 4 main engine names in circulation: <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a>, <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a>, <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> and <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt</a> and thus the cycle can be redone in the next turn. A serious problem with the deck is the advantage it gives the opponent because there are monsters that have a <strong>floating effect</strong> when they leave the field to the gy or when they simply go to the gy, such as the <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Kitt"">Tri-Brigade Kitt</a> and <a data-name=""Nervall"">Nervall</a>, among other examples such as the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Destroyer"">Destroyer Phoenix Destroyer</a>. Enforcer that I happened to be able to send it to gy with the <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> effect and when I used <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> eff it brought the DPE back and that way the floating effect was alive again. As for <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt</a>, the situation is even more complicated because the opponent being able to add a monster to his hand is the worst condition a card could have since many times the card he adds back are hand traps like <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom </a>and <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> that will disturb you too much. That's why Ogdoabyss' best matchup is against Trap decks because they almost never have monsters in the gy so Keurse and Aleirtt's effects become free, but of course a card like <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> solves the problem for the opponent who is Another risk factor in the deck's gameplay: having <strong>Aleirtt banned</strong> virtually makes it impossible for your engine to continue recycling resources. Another problem with the Ogdoadic engine is the fact that you don't retain resources in the hand so as all monsters are in the gy you always find yourself at a card disadvantage in relation to the opponent during turns. About me not using <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a> in this build and its relationship with <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a>: It is the best interaction that the Ogdoadic engine provides us but you will hardly summon it when tribute 3 monsters but with Water Lily and that's the big problem around the card, the fact that it is only <strong>viable if you use multiple copies</strong> of Water Lily and in the beginning when I tested the deck I used 3 copies because it is excellent in the grind game. Then I saw that the deck needed more consistency and I cut it down to 2 copies and finally I realized that Water Lily <strong>doesn't improve</strong> any play of the Ogdoabyss engine if you try to use it <strong>as a Starter</strong> along with <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> or <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> then it is a card that just is good when you have at least 4 Reptiles in GY or have already accessed <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> and Keurse Summon Nauya plays so it doesn't make your engine come out of inertia unless you have already activated other Ogdoabyss cards and therefore lower it for 1 copy was excellent for maintaining deck consistency. I say that using multiple copies of Water Lily is only good if you are using the pure version of the deck. What brought me the most doubts about this build is the use of <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a> or <a data-name=""Aron, the Ogdoadic"">Aron, the Ogdoadic</a> and their speech as follows: Aron has an <strong>interaction effect</strong> that's easier to resolve than Amunessia's because the simplest thing to happen is for the opponent to add a card to their hand and it even manages to be better than <a data-name=""Dark Law"">Dark Law</a> because it doesn't need to be added from the deck but of the GY as for example he trigger eff if the opponent uses the effect of <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Golden Lord</a> of summon because no one remembers but first he adds himself to the hand and then enters the field. This effect is so good that your opponent will think twice before leaving adding cards to the hand for fear of losing an important card. Amunessia's interaction effect is more powerful than Aron's but it's much easier to play around it and we don't have many decks in this format that need to summon gy monsters at the beginning of their moves before dealing with the Amunessia. The cool thing about this effect is that it combo with <em>Keurse</em> because the opponent can summon from a gy monster when Keurse enters the field (by the effect itself) so this is a way to try to force the Amunessia effect to happen but still the opponent can simply choose not to summon the GY.  Now what made me opt for Amunessia is the use of the second effect of the cards because Aron brings the advantage over Amunesia of being able to add any Ogdoadic to the hand that already pays the <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> cost at the same time you decrease the number. of bad draws in the deck having a better top deck. But the fact that Amunessia gives GY summon easily is very relevant if you want to avoid the worst part of Ogdoadic Keurse monsters and especially Aleirtt from <strong>giving free resources to the opponent</strong> and this is relevant from the point of view of having a consistent way to access Aleirtt without the opponent being able to add a monster back to the hand at the same time you return two banned monsters and can very potentially return <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> to the GY for example is something that is priceless. As you don't use Ogdoabyss, the monster you bring won't generate interaction but it already guarantees access to cards like Zeroboros in the opponent's turn with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. Another very good factor of Amunesia is the simple fact that it is a DARK attribute which is relevant if you want to summon it at the end of your play with <em>Water Lily</em>, unlike Aron, which cannot because of the restriction of Orcust monsters. I believe that Amunessia proved to be the best option to use in conjunction with Orcust.  What I find most interesting about Orcust is the fact that the gameplay is very intelligent and I think it is one of the decks that most represent modern yugioh in the way of being cyclical and never running out of gas and having effective interactions with the opponent. I don't really miss <a data-name=""Harp Horror"">Harp Horror</a> and with it the deck won't improve to the point of becoming a meta again, but it will be the ideal way to use having access to Knightmare and <a data-name=""Skeleton"">Skeleton</a> in the GY since the <a data-name=""World Wand"">World Wand</a> doesn't allow you this combination but the Harp Horror does. The fact that Harp Horror is Level 4 is also very good for this version of the deck using the Ogdoadic engine because it improves the mix of moves using <em>Nunu and Nauya</em> and the deck would have more consistency and power. Regarding Orcust card ratios at the beginning I used 3 Knightmare and 2 Skeleton and 1 <a data-name=""Crescendo"">Crescendo</a> but after testing a lot and doing probabilities I came to the conclusion that at first I never want to see 2 Knightmare in my starting hand so I only use 2 copies for decrease this chance and I also realized that whenever I opened with Skeleton in my hand, he was essentially the worst draw among the initial 5 cards, that is, he bricks my hand every time I see him and Crescendo has the conflict that I don't being able to use the Ogdoadic engine in the turn that activates its Search effect which is too costly since the Ogdoadic engine is very important in the functioning of the deck but I confess that in grind game matches I missed setting Crescendo with the <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>. If you find consistency it's something I'm looking for a lot with this deck so much that I've added <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a> which is the best Danger! to use in this deck because it is Level 4, which greatly improves Ogdoadic plays and its effect when discarded has a lot of synergy with Orcust and Ogdoadic cards and it's not crazy to use it because you already have the problem of giving free resources to the opponent with Keurse and Aleirtt so it won't be Mothman! the only villain in history to give the opponent an advantage.  In Extra Deck I have comments to make about the use of <a data-name=""Exciton Knight"">Exciton Knight</a>, <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a>, <a data-name=""Sanaphond"">Sanaphond</a>, <a data-name=""Lambda"">Lambda</a>: these 4 cards are used to improve the playing options of the Ogdoadic engine because thanks to <a data-name=""Zohah"">Zohah</a> it is very easy in the Grind Game to start the turn doing Exciton Knight to force interactions from the opponent besides after using the effect you go to battle phase and do AA-Zeus in Main Phase 2 and force one more interaction. Sanaphond is a counter to the deck's own two engines and you won't be able to use any Orcurst effects on your opponent's turn when doing so but I consider it the best generic RANK-8 option to do with the Ogdoadic engine because it puts a lot of pressure on the field with an absurd atk/def stat that cannot be destroyed by effects. Lambda is very good so you guarantee you have live Gamma in your hand turn 1 and you can return the Driver to GY with Aleirtt so even if you use Gamma and it gets banned in the End Phase with Driver and Lambda trigger eff to add another Gamma from your deck you simply use Aleirtt's effect and let the Gamma live again to protect you from hand traps or interrupt the opponent. About the use of 2 <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> it turns out that you don't necessarily access the second Dingirsu with the Orcust engine but Ogdoadic does this role of the use of the second copy. Regarding <a data-name=""Longirsu"">Longirsu</a> I have to say that the LINK-3 is the worst LINK rating there is unless you are a potencial LINK-4 by nature like <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> but Longirsu when you can do it he proves to be the difference between losing and winning games.  A detail about the combos I was at the beginning testing with <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a> instead of <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a> when I made the tutorials so it turns out that you are supposed to use <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a> in the beginning before using Orcust monster effects so as I now use Amunessia it's much better to save to use Water Lily at the end of the combo. In some combos I don't even use Water Lily because I don't have 4 Reptiles with <strong>different names</strong> in the GY before I need to use the effects of Orcust monsters but that only happens if you want to summon from Ogdoabyss, at the end of the combo it's practically always possible to use the Water Lily to give Summon of Amunessia which is something I want to emphasize about tutoring.

A cool play to watch is <a data-name=""Skeleton"">Skeleton</a> Reborn <a data-name=""Girsu,"">Girsu,</a> and Girsu send Knightmare and Knightmare send <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi"">Gizmek Orochi</a> or <a data-name=""World Wand"">World Wand</a> to summon Skeleton back LINK-2 Galatea and eff Shuffle World Wand and set Babel and make Dingirsu to attach Knightmare and make I:P Masquerena or ANOTHER Galatea Opponent's turn: Skeleton Reborn Dingirsu and eff to Send and Galatea Shuffle Skeleton set Return or Crescendo Even if <a data-name=""Babel"">Babel</a> is sent to GY whoever is your Draw for Turn you can set Babel again. This synergy also applies with <a data-name=""Zohah"">Zohah</a> which is why I use Exciton Knight because you can always return Zohah to hand and Normal Summon and use <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> eff and Tribute to <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> that brings Nauya and that way you can do it the Exciton Knight in the grind game. Gizmek Orochi eff and Knightmare target Orochi send Skeleton and Skeleton eff Reborn Dingirsu and Dingirsu Attach Skeleton  Some technical play from the deck: <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> te lock in Special Summon from Reptile monster and you usually get out of lock by doing RANK-4 <a data-name=""Feral Imps"">Feral Imps</a> or tributing it to <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> for example. Forgetting this restriction costs games. <a data-name=""Water Lily"">Water Lily</a> only Special Summons if you have 5 Reptiles with DIFFERENT NAMES in the GY and not if you have 5 Reptiles including repeat copies. <a data-name=""Girsu,"">Girsu,</a> can only create a token on each side of the field if you don't control other monsters. Speaking of lock you on something, all Orcust cards lock you on Dark after using its effects so basically you should always summon from Nunu and Keurse before using the Orcust engine. <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi"">Gizmek Orochi</a> can only use 1 of the effects per turn, so if you want to get the most out of it you must summon it in the End Phase of your opponent's turn to be able to use the pop effect on your turn. It is not uncommon for you to LINK-4 with this deck using 4 monsters as material because Ogdoadic cards are very good at putting 2-3 monsters on the field and unless you have a <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a> or <a data-name=""Longirsu"">Longirsu</a> on the field the Orcust engine will only Give you monsters that count as Link Rating 1. A problem with this deck is the fact that when you're locked in Dark there aren't good LINK-2 options available so you end up having to do it using multiple monsters to access a LINK- 3 or LINK-4 in place.  Overall I think the deck is far from competitive even more with so much unfair in this format where all decks either use a Floodgate that says ""You won't play yugioh"" or use <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (DPE) which is a card very difficult to deal with this deck unless the opponent leaves it on the field to be sent to gy with Dingirsu which wins games alone for no reason. For sure after the next banlist this deck will be better to play at least until the arrival of <strong>Brave Token</strong> which is essentially a new engine to be abused on the same level as DPE bringing many problems to the format and making yugioh less and less fun."

The effect of Minerva is basically just a draw 3 in this deck and Qaroth is a draw 2. This deck is hyper-consistent due to the amount of graveyard setup and drawing. You have cards like Pot of avarice to help prevent yourself from decking out though you will usually just win by then due to the insane effects that the Lightsworn archetype gets from milling your own deck.

This deck tries to play a longer game than most Tri-Brigade decks, and focuses on recurring resour","This deck is built to play a longer version of the game than most Tri-Brigade decks. This is a bit off the beaten path, and any advice or insight you might have I am open to.  The deck's main goals are two-fold: use the Tri-Brigade monsters to get out their bosses and create card advantage, and use the Melffy engine to remove opponents cards and negate their effects. I won't go over the Tri-Brigade strategy here because I believe most other Tri-Brigade deck-lists have it covered better than I could. The Melffy engine is similar to most others you will see: use Puppy to pull out Kalantosa who then pops a card. We are Tri-ing (sorry) something a bit different by including Melffy Pony and Melffy Fenny. Pony can put Kalantosa back in hand from the GY, and Fenny can summon a Kalantosa from hand (useful if we hard-draw it or recurse it with pony).  We also included the Hop Ear Squadron and Valerifawn, both of which are tuners. We can use those to make Herald of the Arc Light for a negate, or Jiujiu for staying power (it is very easy to get 2 monsters with the same type and attribute in our GY). The only other real departure for our deck from the norm is two copies of Pot of Avarice. Since we want to play a drawn out game, this card helps control our GY, returning any Melffys sent there and recursing our link monsters.

Go again","I was playing before invoked dogmatika dpe/shaddol and i can say Utopia Invoked is much stronger and the price is much cheaper. Utopia Invoked can keep playing even if the opponent use 2 - 3 negates thanks to Armed/Ascended sage because u can chain with utopia double the same turn. The purpose of Kaiju is as board breaker and light target for Invoked engine and Small World. This deck doesn't need Artemis or Almiraj - Gardna for invoked engine.  Magical Mallet is the replacement of pot of prosperity. The most important turn in duel is your first turn, doesn't matter if u going first or second, your first turn is important, u can draw up to 4 new cards if u going first and up to 5 cards if u going second, thanks to magical mallet, much better card for this deck than upstart goblin and pot of desire. also, if u have a brick (pegasus, double or nothing etc) in your hand u can shoufle them back in deck, same as zexal construct.  Small World can be easily used, just banish 1 light monster from your hand, reveal Effect Veiller from the deck and add 1 Aleister, Armed/Ascended sage, Astral Kuriboh or Kaiju to you hand. Basicaly u have acess to every monster in your deck except tornado and bancho, thanks to small world and Effect Veiller. Small world most of the time will be used when you have in your hand (Onomatopaira + Aleister/Meltdown), (Aleister + Aleister) , (Extender + Extender) and/or + kaiju  Always u will want in your hand 1 starter and 1 extender, in that way even if your opponent use 2-3 negates u can still keep playing. Starters (14 cards), chance to open going first 90%: onomatopaira, onomatopickup, meltdown, Aleister (+ small world) Extenders (13), chance to open going first 88%: Astral Kuriboh, Armed/Ascended sage (+ searchers Zexal construct, reinforcement, small world) Board Breakers , chance to open going second 71%: kaiju Consistency (2): Magical Mallet (thanks to it the chance to open starter is increasing to 93% , extender 91% and board breaker 74%)  bricks (2): double or nothing and pegasus (hyper rank, tornado and invocation is considered bad draw but they still can be used) solutions: -If u draw double or nothing u can go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado. -If u draw pegasus, use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22/90 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects. -If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand.  the deck is good going second and first. if u play competetive, then u will see a lot of swordsoul and birds users. tips: if u going against swordsoul then go second and use more monster negate (number 90) instead omni negate (number 22), if u go against birds then go first.  This is my first day testing the budget version, it can go against any meta deck and i can go in tournament with this deck because is not expensive. Invoked dogmatika dpe/shaddol was my previous deck, it is strong, however, Invoked Utopia is much stronger and cheaper. Around 200 dolars should be the price for the whole deck including side deck.  Hand traps lovers, this deck doesn't have space for hand traps, however, hand traps is to interrupt and prevent board to be established but board breakers can destroy already established board. One deck to run hand traps there must be at least 10 - 12 free spaces for them because u can't prevent board to be established just with veiller / impermamence, u must use more than 1 hand trap to do that (except if u are lucky and draw nibiro), but for the board breakers 6-7 cards is perfectly fine because u need 1 card to destroy already established board. So don't replace kaiju for example with hand traps or dark ruler or whatever, everything in the main deck have purpose.  probably i will update the side deck and extra deck in future, but for now is ok Video with few duels from the 1st day testing:  https://youtu.be/g9jnnbiO-no"

It's a ritual combo deck that abuses the non-hard once per turn on ritual summon effects of their level-4 ritual monsters to gain advantage, and their ability to use those monsters to ritual summon more Megalith monsters or any other ritual monsters. This combined with the fact that they are rock monsters and thus could use Gallant Granite to search, the Adamancipator monsters as tuner extenders for Crystron Halqifibrax, and Block Dragon as a repeatable +3 allowed the deck to see niche high-level play during 2020. The archetype was also released on Duel Links in Chronicle of Glory in July 2020 and would see niche play there too especially after the release of Xyz monsters to that game as a deck that could repeatedly destroy 2-6 cards with Megalith Bethor, then attack for large amounts of damage using Megalith Phaleg's boost and could search cards like Cyber Angel Dakini as an out to Invoked Cocytus or make use of a toolbox of Rank-4 and Rank-8 Xyz monsters. In Common Charity then deck functions similar to the Duel Links version in some regards, the deck is built to repeatedly destroy the opponents' cards with Bethor, gaining advantage through the deck's field spell, Megalith Portal, and continuous trap, Megalith Emergence, it has access to a toolbox of Rank-4 and Rank-8 Xyz monsters like Time Thief Redoer, Tornado Dragon, or Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon and it can deal with opposing strategies through searchable cards like Cyber Angel Dakini, Amorphactor Pain, or Artifact Lancea, but it also has access to some of the most powerful set-up pieces of the archetype, Megalith Unformed, which allows you to ritual summon from the deck by tributing twice that monsters level, and Megalith Phul, a level-2 ritual monster that on ritual summon adds a ritual monster from your GY and becomes that monsters level and can ritual summon Megalith monsters from the deck by tributing monsters from hand or field during both players' main phases. Additionally, the deck plays well into some of the more common removal in the format - Kaijus. Most of the boards the deck makes lose very little to a Kaiju, you can still pop 2-4 on your opponent's main phase using Bethor's effect if you bring back Phul using Emergence, and you can use the Kaiju as ritual material, Jizikiru and Dogoran can be the entire requirement for summoning a level-8 Megalith using Phul or the level-8s, the level-4 monsters can use themselves and a Raidan in order to summon a high-level ritual monster, and Dogaran specifically can be used as the entire requirement to summon a level-4 monster off of Unformed or be overlayed with another level-8 to make one of the deck's rank-8 monsters.  2-Card Combos  This Version of Megalith is built around having multliple two-card combos that set up Phul + Portal + Emergance. There are 2 main ways the deck facilitates this Unformed and Advanced Ritual Art. Each of these two card combos can be expanded upon in different ways depending on the other cards in your hand, and most combos that don't start with a piece tend to do similar things just with a higher investment.  Unformed + Senju/Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Senju of the Thousand Hands or Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands, use their effect to add Megalith Och.</li>  	<li>Activate Megalith Unformed tributing Och in order to summon Megalith Phul. Phul adds Och back to hand becoming a level 4 in the process.</li>  	<li>Tribute the Senju/Manju in order to summon Megalith Hagith from the deck, Hagith's effect adds Megalith Portal.</li>  	<li>Activate Megalith Portal, then activate Hagith's effect in order to ritual summon Och from hand using itself as material, this proccs Portal which adds back the Hagith. You can also activate Och to draw a card, and then discard a card.</li>  	<li>Activate Och's effect to ritual summon the Hagith from hand. Activate Hagith's effect again to search Megalith Emergence. Set Emergence.</li>  	<li>You now have 2 level-4 monsters on field - Hagith and Phul, Portal and Emergence, and 1 Ritual Monster name already in the GY. You can overlay the two monsters for a rank-4 or keep them around as ritual material or allow you to play through removal on Emergence depending on the situation.</li> </ol> Advanced Ritual Art + Senju/Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Senju/Manju, use their effect to add Megalith Hagith.</li>  	<li>Activate Advanced Ritual Art to ritual summon Hagith by sending a level 4 normal monster from your deck like Dunames Dark Witch. Hagith effect adds Unformed.</li>  	<li>Activate Unformed tribute the Hagith for Phul. Phul adds back the Hagith and becomes level-4.</li>  	<li>Phul effect tribute the Senju/Manju for a Hagith from deck. Hagith adds Portal.</li>  	<li>Activate Portal. Use the Hagith to ritual summon on field to ritual summon the Hagith in hand. Hagith adds Emergence. Portal can add the Hagith in GY to hand.</li>  	<li>You're in a similar position to the first combo except you a second Hagith in rotation rather than an Och, and you've used the garnet in the deck. This can be worse in certain situations where you want to revive Och with Emergence to ritual summon a non-Megalith Ritual Monster during your opponent's main phase.</li> </ol> Hagith + Manju: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Manju, add Advanced Ritual Art</li>  	<li>Step-2 on from combo 2.</li> </ol> Apart form the Megalith cards and cards mentioned in combos there are a bunch of cards that can be played in this deck in the main, side, or extra deck that have specific applications in this deck compared to others <ul>  	<li>Cyber Angel Benten is a level-6 ritual monster that when tributed can add a Light Fairy monster from your deck to your hand, such as Manju or Senju. This effect is not once per turn and could search itself leading it to be limited because of its interactions with Drytron monsters in advanced. It also has an on field effect that never comes up which is that it does burn when it destroys a monster by battle equal to that monsters defence.</li>  	<li>Cyber Angel Dakini is a level-8 Light Fairy ritual monster that makes the opponent send one of their monsters to the GY, this is non-destructive, non-targeting, non-effecting removal, which means it can out a boss with any protection if your opponent does not have any other monsters on field. This gives the deck a searchable out to Gouki The Powerload Ogre or Lunalight Leo Dancer among other problematic bosses. It also gives your ritual monsters piercing and can return a ritual monster from your GY to your hand during your end phase.</li>  	<li>Cyber Angel Vrash is a level-10 Light Fairy ritual monster that on summon destroys all monsters your opponent controls that were special summoned from the Extra Deck and burn for 1000 for each and attack twice that turn. It also has a Stardust Dragon effect by shuffling a ritual monster from your GY into your deck. If there were less indestructible Extra Deck monsters around I might run this. Being a level-10 changes the ritual maths a little - you can't tribute 2 level-4s, but you can tribute a level-4 and a level-6 or higher monster.</li>  	<li>Artifact Lancea is a level-5 Light Fairy non-ritual effect monster that can be tributed from hand or field during your opponent's turn to stop players from banishing cards. It is a searchable way to deal with Tenyi's follow up for a turn, which is normally long enough to turn the tide such that you can establish control of the game.</li>  	<li>Demise, Agent of Armageddon is level-4 ritual monster that is a non-targeting pop when ritual summoned and if it is sent to the GY, you can target one of your ritual monsters then while that monster is on the field your opponent can't respond to any of your ritual monsters effects - even ones in the GY.</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain is a level-8 ritual monster that after it is summoned your opponent skips their next Main Phase 1 (Which at time of writing is bugged on EDO Pro) and negates the effects of face-up Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Monsters on the field. This can shut down Lunalight as their main forms of interaction are through Xyz and Fusion monsters and the effect to skip their main phase 1 also allows you to effectively Threatning Roar them on subsequent turns when you have dealt with their current field.</li>  	<li>Lord of the Red is a level-8 ritual monster that can destroy 1 target spell/trap and 1 target monster per turn each when a card or effect is activated. This is a decent Pre-Preparation of Rites target that allows you to potentially destroy 2 cards per turn, however the deck already has an in archetype way of destroying even more cards every turn.</li>  	<li>Transonic Bird is a level-4 ritual monster that can send a ritual spell from the deck during your opponent's turn to copy its effect, it's ritual spell Sonic Tracker makes the Bird's level equal the level of its material and can be banished from the GY to target a ritual monster then send a monster with the same type or attribute from the deck to the GY. This enables a 3 card way to resolve Amorphactor Pain before your opponent's next main phase and can set up additional names and target in the GY for your Megaliths, however this is pretty gimmicky, requires more bricks in the form of Earth Chant, and the other effects of Transonic Bird don't synergise with any of the other ritual monsters the deck runs.</li>  	<li>Trade In is a spell that can discard a level-8 monster in order to draw 2 cards. This deck is playing a reasonably high number of level-8 monsters already, so this card could give the deck more consistency, however it can still be dead and when it is, it's only use is to be discarded with Och. I would like to test this card out in the Future.</li> </ul>"

Game 1 we play Mekk-Knight Orcust, pretty fun and basic Mekk-Knight stuff with some Orcust combos on the side after youv'e made your Mekk plays thanks to Girsu.  Game 2 we side out <strong>ALL</strong> the Orcust cards. This includes; World Wand, Knightmare, 2x GIrsu, Skele, Bombard, Crescendo, Return, Instant Fusion, Card Destruction, Winda, Dingirsu, Galatea. And we put in all the Crusadia cards.  Mekk-Crusadia is also pretty swell, basic Mekk-Knight stuff, with the capability to OTK thanks to the Crusadia cards.  Instant Fusion + Winda is actually very good for reasons other than Dingirsu, can use her for Link 2 material, bring her back with Succ for some bullying, but can also bring her back with Secrets as it grabs any level 5+ monster. Something very obvious but I figured it's worth mentioning anyway.  Some notes, Card Destruction is there because I needed a 15th card to side out and I thought it would be fun and dumb to include in the list, could probably find something more useful to have there like, literally any 1 off. Clara &amp; Rushika is there for if you've bricked going second with only an Orcust normal summon and Mekk-Knights in hand, can use it in MP2 to make Mekk plays, not a good card should probably run Linkuriboh for the Girsu token but Linkuriboh isn't cute girls so it didn't make the cut  Also, the deck has next to no goign first plays. Unless you open Girsu or a Crusadia monster, you have 0 going first cards.  &nbsp;"

Also includes a few generic budget cards,"<em>Price based on ygoprodeck.com's TCGPlayer estimated USD price on January 9th, 2022. </em>  <hr />  <strong>Deck Overview</strong>: A simple go-second deck focused on quickly fusion summoning Evil HEROs with Masked HEROs as a back-up option. Also includes a few generic budget cards to boost the overall power level of the deck.  <strong>Game Strategy</strong>: Can reliably summon an Evil HERO fusion in one turn, and all HEROs in the deck can be used as Mask Change targets. If two HEROs are on the field, can Link Summon Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer to search fusion materials from the deck while also increasing the attack of Evil HEROs it points to. A Hero Lives can summon Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to search Mask Change in a single turn. Supreme King's Castle can be used to boost the attack of an Evil HERO in battle against another monster - and can send the Evil HERO Dark Gaia in the Extra Deck to increase by 1600 ATK. Raigeki and Red Reboot are generic cards to improve power level when going second, while the three Solemn Warning are generic cards to improve power level when going first instead.  <strong>Budget Upgrades</strong>: Obvious picks would be going for Evil HERO Malicious Bane, Evil HERO Adusted Gold, and Evil HERO Sinister Necrom to boost the overall power level and consistency of the deck. E -Emergency Call can also improve the deck's consistency. Can also go for extra copies of Keeper of Dragon Magic, Elemental HERO Prisma, and Elemental HERO Shadow Mist."

Typically, your end boards consist of caeser (2 solemn warnings), makina with a dark contract on the field (a weird kind of hope harbinger for monsters that doesnt negate), siegfreid (hot red dragon archfiend abyss for spells and traps) and dark contract with the eternal darkness (continuous trap that locks the opponent from tributing for a tribute summon (flunderezze), fusing monsters from the field or using monsters for a synchro or xyz materials. It also provides nifty protection. It can usually do this around nib (berfomet change a dd to lvl six overlay with lil gengis and make caeser) and can play around dark ruler (hint: respond to dark ruler with eternal darkness then chain siegfried negate). It can play through a through  disruptions, but not a fully established board (in most cases). Thats why we have a side deck. It is a fun, semi-competitive, reasonably budget but pretty damn hard to play deck. The combo lines vary a lot and it can take a bit of thinking to find the ideal route. Have fun!"

Dimension guardian will keep her destroyed but the main draw back is kiwi will be in attack for at least the turn this trap is activated. I am pretty sure once activated Kiwi can be switched to defense. Other than that Quintet is the main monster play especially with Kiwi so that he can not be targeted. A lot of other plays can be made depending on the hand you start with and draw into. Fun deck but can be very bricky.

The 6th version of my first real deck I've owned in real life. None of the,"<p><span>This is an improvement of an older version of this deck with the same name. If you're curious about that deck, you can view it here: https://ygoprodeck.com/wrath-of-the-conductor/</span></p> <span>This was the first deck I posted to YGOPRO. Since then, new cards were discovered, and new strategies were developed, so even when a deck seems finished, it isn't. Usually. This one is. I'm tired of reworking this one, and I'm finally satisfied with the way it performs. The old version relied on summoning <span>Ultimate Tyranno Conductor</span> and maintaining his field presence. This version still does that, but adds in a new gimmick revolving around the Field Spell card, <span>Lost World</span>. I'll explain <span>Lost World</span> first, and the other cards that boost it's functionality.</span>  <span>First and foremost, <span>Terraforming</span> is used for instant access to <span>Lost World</span>. What exactly does <span>Lost World</span> do? A lot. Immediately, all non-Dinosaur monsters lose 500 ATK/DEF. That's pretty busted right there, but we're not done yet. Once per turn, when a Dinosaur monster is Normal or Special Summoned (Extra Deck included), a Jurraegg Token is generated on your opponent's side of the field. While they control this token, no monsters, other than tokens, can be targeted by their card effects. Now hang on, we're still not done yet. When a Normal monster anywhere on the field would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy Dinosaurs in your hand or deck instead. Quick reminder that Tokens are treated as Normal monsters. That might not seem like the best idea, but it is. Let's find out why.</span>  <span>There are 2 monsters in particular to use the destruction effect of Lost World on. These are going to be <span>Babycerasaurus</span>, and <span>Petiteranodon</span>. They have effects that trigger when they are destroyed by card effect, and it doesn't matter if they are in your hand or not. To do this, first Normal Summon a Dinosaur monster, preferably something like <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, or <span>Black Brachios</span>. This will generate said Token to your opponent's field. Next, while a token is present on your opponent's field, declare an attack, then activate <span>Lost World</span>. Rather than destroying one of the tokens by battle, you will destroy one of your own monsters instead. <span>Babycerasaurus</span> allows you to Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> or lower Dinosaur monster from your deck. Your best bet here is either going to be <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, whose effect can still trigger from Special Summoning, <span>Scrap Raptor</span>, the decks one and only Tuner monster, or <span>Megalosmasher X</span>, who has 2000 ATK. When <span>Petiterandon</span> is chosen, you Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> or higher monster from your deck. This is obviously the better option, and lets you immediately summon <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>, or <span>Frostosaurus</span>. (only choose <span>Frostosaurus</span> if <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span> is elsewhere). These cards only lose their functionality if you somehow have all of your high-tier monsters in your hand or Graveyard; the monsters Special Summoned by the baby dinosaurs effects come straight from the deck. After this has been done 1 or 2 times, and your hand and/or field is set up with all the important cards you need, you can start attacking the tokens.</span>  <span>""But BallinFatty, what did all that accomplish? All the Tokens are in defense Position, and we can't inflict piercing damage"". Right you are. Allow me introduce <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, our solution to this ""problem"", that we purposely created. This behemoth of a T-Rex can only be Special Summoned by banishing 2 Dinosaurs from the Graveyard. Assuming you were using <span>Lost World</span> as optimally as possible, <span>Babycerasaurus</span>, and <span>Petiteranodon</span> among many others who have already activated their effects should be there by now. By this time, you should also already have this card in your hand, most of your other high level dinosaurs on the field, and several Jurraegg Tokens on your opponent's side of the field. One last thing this guy can do, if your opponent happens to control any Attack Position monsters, you can destroy 1 monster in your hand or field, which changes all your opponents monsters into face-down Defense Position. This is also a potential way to trigger <span>Babycerasaurus</span>/<span>Petiteranodon's</span> effects. Once your field is set up, and <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> is ready, enter the Battle Phase. <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can attack all monsters your opponent controls, (which should consist mostly of Defense Position Jurraegg Tokens) instantly destroying any Defense Position monsters, removing the possibility of Flip effects activating, while inflicting 1000 points of damage in the process. It should go without saying, but during this time, you don't want to activate <span>Lost World's <span>effect</span></span>. Once the field is clear of monsters, if you have enough remaining attack power on your field, you could potentially win the game by attacking with the rest of your Dinosaurs.</span>  <span>Now that the main gimmick of the deck has been covered, let's take a brief look at the other monsters we have in the Main Deck:</span>  <span><span><em><span>Frostosaurus</span>:</em></span> A Normal monster with 2600 ATK, only requiring 1 Tribute. Can be easily summoned using <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it leaves the field for whatever reason. Not a bad choice for <span>Petiteranodon</span> if your Tyrannos are already present.</span> <span><span><em><span>Megalosmasher X</span></em></span>: Solid 2000 ATK, <span>Level 4</span> Normal monster. Useful for <span>Synchro</span>/<strong>XYZ</strong> summoning.</span> <span><span><em>Black Brachios</em></span>: Useful for revealing face-down monsters, or disrupting a high powered attacker.</span> <span><span><em>Miscellaneousaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to protect your monsters from effects during the Main Phase, fulfilling one half of <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's</span> Special Summon condition. Has a Special Summon effect that doesn't see much use unless the duel goes on for a very long time, and you have at least 4 Dinosaurs in your Graveyard.</span> <span><span><em>Scrap Raptor</em></span>: The decks only Tuner monster, and the only <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur Tuner that exists at all, at the time of writing. It's effect only functions within the Scrap archetype, so it is ignored in this deck.</span> <span><span><em>Souleating Oviraptor</em></span>: One of the most important monsters in this deck. Can be used to add any Dinosaur from the deck to either your hand, or Graveyard. This can get you <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> early on, can provide you with your Tuner, or if <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> is set, instant access to <span>Frostosaurus</span> or <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Tyranno</span></em></span>: Similar to <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, but without the ability to instantly destroy Defense Position monsters. If this monster is on your field, it must attack every monster your opponent controls before your other monsters can attack. Try not to use this guy when <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> is present.</span>  <span>Now for the Spells and Traps:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Fossil Dig</span></span></em>: Used to grab any <span>Level 6</span> or lower Dinosaur from the deck, which is every monster aside from either of the Tyrannos.</span> <span><em><span><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></span></em>: Revives any fallen monster from your Graveyard. Note that <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can be Special Summoned with this card, as long as it was Special Summoned via it's own effect first before ending up in the Graveyard.</span> <span><em><span><span>Paleozoic Canadia</span></span></em>: Changes one of your opponent's monsters to Face-down Defense Position. Useful for disrupting powerful attackers, or setting up targets for <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> to massacre. Once per chain, you can Summon this card from the Graveyard as a Normal Monster, providing yourself <span>Lost World</span> fodder, or preparation for a special <strong>XYZ</strong> monster lurking in the Extra Deck.</span> <span><em><span><span>Paleozoic Olenoides</span></span></em>: Destroys 1 Spell or Trap on the field. Once per chain, you can Summon this card from the Graveyard as a Normal Monster, providing yourself <span>Lost World</span> fodder, or preparation for a special <strong>XYZ</strong> monster lurking in the Extra Deck.</span> <span><em><span><span>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</span></span></em>: Negates Trap Cards at the cost of 1000 Life Points. </span> <span><em><span><span>Survival Of The Fittest</span></span></em>: Adds 1000 ATK to any Dinosaur. Most useful on the <span>Level 4</span> monsters, as the higher level ones already have huge attack powers and can clear the field easily. Destroying a monster with the ATK boosts allows the monster to make a second attack on monsters. Useless on both Tyrannos, as they already have access to multiple attacks per Battle Phase</span>  <span>Finally, lets take a look at the Extra Deck:</span>  <span><em><span><span>Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</span></span></em>: [1 Dinosaur Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] The deck's only <span>Synchro Monster</span>. This monster is very powerful. It becomes the attack magnet while it is face-up, it can destroy a single monster once per turn, your opponent cannot activate Spells/Traps while it is attacking, and you can sacrifice another card you control if this guy would be destroyed. A great target for <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it somehow gets taken out. Can easily be <span>Synchro Summoned</span> using <span>Scrap Raptor</span> and almost any other Dinosaur in the deck.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Dollka</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] Useful for negating monster effects. Can be done twice using it's material.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] The most versatile of the 3 <strong>XYZ's</strong>, <strong>Laggia</strong> can negate a single Summon, or Spell/Trap activation.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Evolzar Solda</strong></span></em>: [2 <span>Level 6</span> Dinosaur monsters] Very rarely used, I just included with the rest of the Evolzar's so he wouldn't feel left out. If you do manage to get this guy out, he is immune to effect destruction while he has material, and can detach 1 material to destroy your opponents Special Summons.</span> <span><em><span><strong>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</strong></span></em>: Requires 3 or more <span>Level 2</span> monsters to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong>. The Paleozoic Traps fulfill this condition when they are resurrected from the Graveyard as monsters. This thing looks cool as hell, and has a decent destruction effect along with 2400 ATK. By detaching a material that was originally a Trap Card (<span>Paleozoic Canadia</span> and <span>Olenoides</span>), you can destroy one card on the field.</span> <span><em><span><span>Trackblack</span></span></em>: **DISCLAIMER: THIS CARD IS NOT RELEASED IN THE TCG**. Despite that, I have tested it out in the downloadable game ""Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dawn Of A New Era"" which has access to most every card in existence, and is constantly being updated. This monster requires 2 Effect monsters to Summon. You can target 1 monster this card points to, once per turn, when it destroys a monster, you draw 1 card. Makes an excellent combo when either <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span> or <span>Frostosaurus</span> are being looked at. This effect does not work with <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>, as his attacks that destroy face-down monsters is considered an effect.</span> <span><em><span><span>Agave Dragon</span></span></em>: A powerful <span>Link Monster</span> with a <span>Link Rating of 4</span>, this monstrosity has many effects, dependent upon the type of monsters used to Summon it. Since this deck only has Dinosaurs, it will see a considerable boost to it's ATK power once Summoned. This card is multi-purpose and also works well in any deck containing a high number of Dragon, Dinosaurs, Sea Serpent, and Wyrms.</span>  <span>That about does it for this deck. Normally I would encourage other ideas and constructive criticism from others, but this is the 6th time I've reworked this deck, and I have no intentions of changing it again. This is the way it is now, and I'm content with that. If you enjoy Dinosaurs, and Non-archetypal decks, give this deck a try. It's very satisfying, with a unique playstyle when <span>Lost World</span> is present, and honestly, any deck that contains Dinosaurs will benefit immensely from <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span>.

You have some great water synchros at your disposal too like dragite and archethys. So how do you achieve this?  How you get penguins to be so good is that you have an in archtype rescue rabbut that you can use multiple times per turn. Here's the combo I came up with:  Get Great Emperor Penguin out on the field in some way  use its effect to summon penguin ninja and puny penguin  use ninja's effect to set puny, then activate squire from your hand to special summon it  use squire's effect to flip puny back up, now making puny live  use squire and puny to go into halq  use puny's effect on CL 1, the hlaq on CL2  Halq will summon Deep Sea Diva and puny will bring back Emp  use Emp again to bring out Nopenguin and polar penguin  go into penguin brave with Nope and polar, this is important because Nope will come back  Penguin brave will activate its effect to set penguin soldier, and the Nopenguin will activate its mandatory effect to special summon itself from the graveyard  then you go into Deep Sea Repititeur with Nope and diva  then go into dragite with your ninja and Repititeur  repititeur will be able to bring back Emp one final time so you can use the effect again to bring out any two penguin monsters, preferably 2 nightmare penguin to go into bahamut shark and bring out Toadally Awesome, but you can go into other stuff with maybe another level 6 synchro.  That's the strategy I came up with, you won't be able to pull it off 24/7 but it stops a lot decks. Feel free to side whatever you want like other floodgates or hand traps and adjust how you see fit."

I again found some cards that would make it better, and here it is! The deck contains:  Main:  3 Luster Dragon- Here only as a material for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""  3 Nexus- Banish 4 opponent's monsters from GY to be special summoned, destroys all ATK position extra deck monsters, AND inflicts 800 damage for each destroyed. Ideal if your opponent plays Invoked.  3 Fleurdelis- Very easy to special summon, negates effects of an extra deck monster and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Ashyan- Easy to summon, adds a monster from the GY to the hand, and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Theo- Easy to summon, cannot be destroyed by battle and transfers 600 ATK from an opponent's monster to itself.  3 Ecclesia- Literally does 70% of support to a whole deck.  3 Adin- Easy to summon, special summons a Dogmatika monster from the deck.  3 Shaddoll Beast- Requires 1 tribute to be set, +1 if flips, and +1 more if destroyed by effect.  3 White Knight- You cannot summon extra deck monsters, but you can destroy an extra deck monster directly from each extra deck.  3 Dogmatikalamity- Used just to summon White Knight.  1 Nation- Only one because you can add it with ""Terraforming"". All dogmatikas are immune to the extra deck monsters' effects and destroy a battling monster instead of  themself.  1 Terraforming- Limited, so only one we can have.  1 Monster Reborn- Limited, so only one we can have.  3 Greater Poly- Very good fusion card, because you can fuse ANY 3 monsters to summon ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".  1 Encounter- Not the best, but useful.  2 Infinite Impermanence- A cheap version of ""Ash Blossom"".  3 Genesis- Returns your banished Extra deck monster and negates opponent's.  3 Quaking Mirror Force- A medusa from Greece mythology, turned into a mirror force. XD  Extra:  1 Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon- Super broken and surely the best ever fusion monster.  1 Number 39: Utopia- Not really the best, but very easy to summon.  1 Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS- Sky Thunder- Easy to summon, has at least 2 Xyz materials when summoned, and does a ""Black Hole"" effect, saves itself  from it, and all of that with a price of just 2 Xyz materials.  1 Decode Talker- Super generic and very easy to summon, it is one of the cards that can level up every weak deck.  1 Decode Talker Extended- The same as the normal ""Decode Talker"", but stronger.  1 Accesscode Talker- Very generic, and also very strong. The upgraded version of previous two Talkers.  1 Predaplant Verte Anaconda- A very good fusion support for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".  Side:  3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- one of the best hand traps ever, screws pretty much everything.  3 Effect Veiler- Simply negates the effects of one monster.  3 Twin Twisters- Destroys two spell/traps on the field.  3 Super Poly- One of the best (if not the best) fusion cards in history.  &nbsp;  Note: You can use ''Cyber-Stein'' instead of Greater and Super polymerization, not just to save some money, but also because it's more useful."

Now you can play the mildly interesting link wyrm deck,"You know how everyone has that one deck? The deck they default to when they want to play Yu-Gi-Oh? This is my deck. Tenyis are one of my all-time favorite archetypes and this might be the last format in a long time that you can play the deck completely unhit. Thanks to Swordsouls and their Wyrm-ness slurping up any cool Wyrm cards for their deck to abuse, Tenyis are sitting in the top tier of the current metagame. And unlike the boring token generators, they aren't new cards. So, as one final hurrah for the greatest archetype to ever grace Yu-Gi-Oh, let's take a look at Tenyi.  I'm pretty sure everyone knows how Tenyis work by now, but in case you don't I'll give a quick summary. Tenyis are a deck that supports non-effect monsters by swarming the board if you only control non-effect monsters and then gaining effects to be banished from the hand or GY to apply a powerful effect if you control a single non-effect monster. Each main deck Tenyi has a different of these second effects and they vary in power from a free special summon from deck to a simple combat trick.  Going through the main deck, the first and most important Tenyi is Ashuna. This card fucking rocks and if you open it, you can end on the best boards the deck can produce. Its effect is the best of all the main deck Tenyis and allows a special summon of a Tenyi from deck with a simple xeno-lock afterwards. Run three until they ban it on the next list for Swordsoul's sins. The next card is Vishuda, another level 7 that instead of providing advantage, it provides a targeted bounce of one card your opponent controls. Again, run three. It might not be the most amazing removal on Earth, but removal is still removal.  The next group of Tenyis are the level 4s. None of these cards have amazing effects, but a pure Tenyi deck needs as many Tenyis as you can run. Nahata is by far the worst of the Tenyis as it only provides a 1500 ATK boost to a non-effect monster. Run at least one since you need Tenyis in deck, but don't max out on it. Next is Mapura which provides a quick negate to any card that targets a non-effect monster. Pretty decent, but most effects don't target nowadays and most players would just target your effect monsters if they see this in grave. Run two or three depending on how much you want that protection. Shthana is the last level 4 and it's by far the best. It gives the deck recoverability that it desperately needs in order to maintain board presence. Run three.  The last main deck Tenyi is Adhara. It's a level 1 tuner which comes up once every 90000 games, but its effect is by far the best part about it. Since your Tenyis end up banished all the time, Adhara just lets you get them back to your hand. Now all the Tenyi effects are hard once per turns, but at least you aren't topdecking for your next turn's plays. Run three and if Konami hits this card, just cry like I will.  The Tenyi spells and traps are extremely good cards as well. Dragon Circle is your search card if dumped off of Foolish Burial Goods, or it can turn your non-effect monsters into Lonefires for Wyrms. Run three. Vessel is the deck's archetypal Foolish Burial and helps set up Tenyis in grave as well as that funky little sea horse we have yet to mention. Also run three. Flawless Perfection turns your non-effect monsters into Towers monsters and gives a Pot of Greed if your opponent special summons while you control a non-effect. Depending on how deep you want to be in the non-effect boss, run one or max out. Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is an archetypal Solemn that I basically never use. Run a few if you know for a fact you will die without negation on board, otherwise just ignore it.  The last main deck cards are pretty self-explanatory. Avarice recycles your links and main deck Tenyis so you don't run out of resources. Foolish Burial Goods lets you use Dragon Circle's better effect. Foolish Burial Not-Goods is your fourth copy of Vessel. Handtraps are handtraps, and you can change the ratios/the actual handtraps by preference. And finally Mare Mare. It's a token generator that you can summon off of one of the Tenyi links. Three tokens to be exact. And those tokens help with link climbing to your best possible boards or even dipping into the hard-to-reach synchro portion of the Extra Deck. I only run one to avoid bricks, but you can run three without losing too much power since it can be discarded for cost of one of their links.  Onto the Extra Deck. Monk is your starter card. Without it, you have no plays. Run three and recycle them often. Next is Shaman. This is your gateway to the sea horse. It lets you revive a Wyrm as long as you discard a card for cost. Now, this Wyrm can be the discarded card. Seeing a pattern? This is the sole reason Mare Mare can be run at more than one as it can be pitched for cost and revived by the same effect. Run two or three depending on how pure you want to be. Draco Masters is a pretty solid card going second. It gives a non-targeting destruction of effect monsters as long as it's the only effect monster you control. Pretty situationally useful given how few board states sit on no effect monsters in this deck (ironic I know), so just run the one. Berserker of the Tenyi is the first of your three boss monsters. As a non-effect monster, it benefits from all of the Tenyi effects as well as Flawless Perfection, but it is just a big dude. Run one or two depending on how many techs you add to your Extra Deck. Sahasrara is the second boss monster of the deck. Gives a token that copies an opponent's monster's stats and then provides protection to your Effect Monsters. Really fucking good, but you'll only ever need one given how recursive the deck is with three Avarice. The final boss monster of the archetype is Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. It gives a quick banish when an effect monster activates its effect (doesn't negate mind you) and can get to some insanely high ATK values if it battles effect monsters. Run one since that's exactly how many synchros you will ever have on field at once in the deck.  Finally, the tech cards. This covers the rest of the Extra and Side Decks. I:P Masquerena is a really solid card in this deck since you can use Mare Mare tokens to make it. The only issue is you usually run into the xeno-locks of the deck during the turns you use that effect, so don't rely on it too much. And with every Masquerena comes an Avramax. Same basic issue as with I:P, but it's a hell of a boss monster if you can bring it out. Apollousa has the same issue, but if you can avoid too many xeno-locks and make it, you get effect negation which is something the deck natively lacks. Another great option is Accesscode. Arguably way better than any card I just mentioned and provides a really quick finisher to the deck. I just hate this card. Yazi and Baxia are cool Synchro techs that get around your xeno-locks 9 times out of 10 and they can help clear boards in some cases.  In the side deck we have a few tech cards as well as general side deck stuff, so it won't be as in-depth. Lava Golem is such a good card in Tenyi thanks to how little they use their normal summon. Just swap it with a Kaiju if you know you never go against people who leave two monsters on board. Ryu Okami is honestly a pretty bad card with how good Dogmatikas have become, but it's a weird floodgate-esque effect that can impact some decks. Just don't side it in if your opponent is on Dogmatika or any other deck that doesn't care if their Extra Deck goes to grave. Mystery Shell Dragon is one of three Wyrm normal monsters, and the only you can normal summon without tribute. I've run into some board states where the Tenyis in hand have no way to make it on board so having a main deck non-effect monster isn't too bad. It just tends to make more bricks then it's worth. Backrow removal is cool and good and Called By is still a hell of a card.  And that about covers the deck. Sorry for the wall of non-colored text, but if you've seen my other decks you should know this is pretty much my standard. This build is definitely far from perfect, so please leave suggestions on how I could improve it. Before the banlist comes out that is. Poor Ashuna. Rip in kill sweet prince.  (Now watch me be wrong and they just ban Protos instead. Please Konami, Ashuna did nothing wrong)"

Despite the uniqueness of the main engine being based around the FA archetype, you might notice that Halqifibrax is the card that makes this deck truly consistent, as such you might consider this another Halqifibrax turbo deck, despite this, the FA archetype does provide some interesting utility that other decks don't.</span>  <span>I'll be breaking down the choices made in the deck-building process down below.</span>  <span><em><span>Main Deck:</span></em></span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Hang On Mach"">FA Hang On Mach</a> </strong>- This is your main FA level four monster and almost every time this is also the card that is going to start your combo along with Auto Navigator, it also offers the backup plan of a macro cosmos that is unaffected by the activated effects of your opponent's monsters, pair this with the main field spell City Grand Prix and you'll have an untargetable monster that is quite the play disruptor </span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Auto Navigator"">FA Auto Navigator</a> </strong>- This is the glue that makes the plays happen, it opens up your deck and fetches you the field spells that make your level modulation plays possible pairing this with UA hyper stadium makes the deck quite consistent, you'll almost always want to see this card</span>  <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;FA&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dark Dragster&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>FA</strong> <strong>Dark Dragster</strong></a> - This card is your main combo extender with the archetype, as such you'll be searching this when you already have Hang On Mach and Auto Navigator it gives you options for going into level 10 synchros and also offers a destruction effect for going second to help break boards, generally you'll go into this after making Dawn Dragster but this card can also be easily summoned with a Hang on Mach and City/Off-Road Grand Prix</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a></strong> - Pretty self-explanatory, draw two from the grave</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - A free special summon, also pretty self-explanatory</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> </strong>- This is the main combo maker off of Halqifribrax you'll also realize that the summon of this card is the main choke point of the deck, simply having Halqifibrax ash blossomed at this point will kill your combo, it's also one of the ""soft"" garnets in your deck as drawing this won't stop you from combing but will net you one less card in hand</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> </strong>- This is the single card in your deck that you absolutely never want to see, this deck does have a backup combo that you can try to play into in the event that this card is in your opening hand but it's not optimal, you'll summon this off of Auroradon</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Test Run"">FA Test Run</a></strong> - This is one of the best cards in the FA archetype, it's non-targeting destruction on a quickplay spell, unfortunately, it does need to change the battle position of an FA monster in order to resolve but this also doubles as a play starter since it special summons from the deck. Unfortunately, it's quite bricky in the deck so you only run one since you can search this off of any of the main FA field spells' destruction</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""UA Hyper Stadium"">UA Hyper Stadium</a></strong> - Fetches you any of your FA monsters and also allows for a second normal summon allowing you to set up the easiest way to get into Halqifibrax in the deck, normal summoning both Hang On Mach and Auto Navigator with the effect of this card</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA City Grand Prix"">FA City Grand Prix </a></strong> - The strongest level modulation and protection effect in the deck, you'll want to end on this card if possible but for the sake of the combo most of the time, unless you have a way to open the combo with Dark Dragster in which case you'd add this card and go into Baronne/Ruddy Rose</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Off-Road Grand Prix"">FA Off-Road Grand Prix </a></strong>- Another field spell that modulates level only in the main phase, you'll only really end on this card if you don't have any other options, this also lets you go into Baronne/Ruddy Rose if you have Dark Dragster but otherwise it is simply in the deck to help start the combo. It does have a delinquent duo effect upon the battle destruction of your FA monsters but you'll almost never see it occur due to the end board of this deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Circuit Grand Prix"">FA Circuit Grand Prix</a></strong> - This is simply used to modulate the level of Dawn Dragster at the end of the combo to get Auto Navigator out one last time to synchro summon Herald Of The Arc Light</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> </strong>- Gets you one of your field spells, usually, you'll add Hyper Stadium. This is essentially the Upstart Goblin of your deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a></strong> - The most recent consistency booster printed in BROL, it gets you any of your mainline FA monsters sans Dark Dragster as you can't normal summon it, you'll most commonly add Auto Navigator</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Pot Of Prosperity"">Pot Of Prosperity</a></strong> - Another consistency booster that allows you to not only allows you to search for combo pieces but also gets you your side deck cards and any other back row disruption in the deck, the restriction doesn't clash at all with the FA search effects making this card an obvious inclusion, it is however not necessary to play this card at all the deck functions very well without it and you can simply slot in more play extenders instead of these.</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> </strong>- Gets you DPE, in the deck to increase the top end power of the deck but also the grind game potential</span>  <span>The remaining cards in the deck can really be anything you want, this list runs Ash, Droplets and a few one-ofs but you have options to tune the deck according to the match-ups you think you'll have to deal with</span>  <span><em><span>Extra</span></em><span> Deck:</span></span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> </strong>- As stated in the explanation of Fusion Destiny this card is simply in the deck to increase the top end power but allows you to play the grind game against decks like Striker and the likes of</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> </strong>- This simply is your backup plan to get into DPE, this is an easy banish for Prosperity oi you feel you won't need it</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> - Your main combo maker you'll want to make this almost every time, this is also your combo's main choke point try to bait out the Ash Blossom with a Piri Reis Map or Prosperity if you feel like you have the combo already</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> </strong>- This is what you'll link into after making Halqifibrax, you can bait the Nibiru out with the summon of this card as the tokens summon regardless of whether or not the Auroradon is tributed at the very least you can make a Baronne</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></strong> - An onmi-negate on a level 4 synchro you'll end on this along with Borrel Savage and Dawn Dragster most of the time</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Crystron Quandax"">Crystron Quandax</a></strong> - A combo piece for the main combo; a level 4 synchro tuner</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Garden Rose Flora"">Garden Rose Flora</a></strong> - A great alternative combo starter if your Halifibrax combo is offline, keep in mind you won't be able to summon DPE because of this cards restriction so this is the less preferable option most of the time</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a></strong> - Your out to Dragoon as well as other undestroyable monsters</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Dawn Dragster"">FA Dawn Dragster</a> </strong>- Your main level 7 synchro works well with the combo to get you one more omni-negate with its level modulation effect in combination with Auto Navigator, also a spell and trap negate</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> - An omni-negate that slot well into the Halqifibrax combo, also one of the beefiest bodies in the deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""FA Motorhome Transport"">FA Motorhome Transport</a></strong> - A beefy body that is tuned in the grind game, pairing it with City Grand Prix makes for a monster with Dragoon level protection</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> </strong>- An alternate level 10 synchro monster to Baronne, it'll win you a lot of game against a deck like Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade that rely on the graveyard to make plays</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></strong> - The go-to generic level 10 synchro monster, if you're playing a synchro deck that doesn't include this monster you must be crazy (or broke)</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> </strong>- An big unaffected beat stick, you can also go into this with any level 1 synchro after being Nibiru'd</span>  <span><em><span>Additional Options for the deck:</span></em></span>  <span>There are quite a lot of cards in the deck that can be fairly expensive to play, thankfully the deck is very flexible so you can play around with the cards quite a bit.</span>  <span>DPE - This can be replaced with a Rainbow Neos engine if you wanna still have an alternate boss monster in the deck otherwise, you can simply replace the entire package with more play extenders or hand traps</span>  <span>Prosperity - Again can be replaced with more play extenders</span>  <span>Baronne - Any synchro that provides utility can replace Baronne, you simply run it in the deck because it's the best level 10</span>  <span>I've talked about play extenders a lot without actually showing what they are so we'll talk about them here.</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Cockadoodledoo"">Cockadoodledoo</a></strong> - This is just a simple tuner that synergizes well with the wind attribute of this deck</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Speedroid Terrortop"">Speedroid Terrortop</a></strong> - A simple wind machine that can get you into the combo</span>  <span><strong><a data-name=""Speedroid Taketomborg"">Speedroid Taketomborg</a></strong> - Another simple wind machine that special summons itself</span>  <span><em>The Combo:</em></span>  <span>For those that like a video to follow along with click <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/GIqgqGpUUA8"">here.</a></span>  <span>The main combo line will start with trying to get two monsters, one being a tuner, to try and get out Halqifibrax, from here you simply summon the Deskbot 001 from the deck, link 3 into Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon get 3 tokens, summon the Deckbot 001 from the grave with its effect, synchro 4 for a Quandax, use Auroradon's effect to tribute two tokens and summon a Phantom Beast from the deck, get Coltwing, summon the two tokens, and then synchro into Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage. At this point, there are a bunch of extenders you could try going for, but you'll likely end with a Herald of the Arclight or a Baronne de Fleur/Ruddy Rose. It may seem like a lot but it's pretty straightforward once you get a hang of it.</span>  <span>This combo is quite fragile and can be disrupted fairly easily by a lot of decks so you'll be a victim of games that feel like you lose at the coin flip but you have many options for going second. </span>  <span><strong>Keep in mind<em>, </em></strong>this isn't the only combo in the deck simply just the most straightforward and simple, I implore you to play around with the deck and find combos that also work.</span>  <span><em><span>Side Deck:</span></em></span>  <span>In this list I play just the usual sides:</span> <span>Dark Ruler helps with playing into a board for turn 2</span> <span>Nibiru helps you beat hard combo decks before they set up the board</span> <span>Droll And Lock also help you lock out decks that rely on searching</span> <span>Comic Cyclone beats mystic mine</span> <span>Anti-Spell helps you beat dark ruler after you've done your combo</span>  <span>As stated previously with 10 flexible slots in this deck and prosperity in the main deck you'll de very likely to see your side deck so consider your options as this list isn't at all concrete.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

These cards can be set as spell/traps, and when they are destroyed they are special summoned, with ranging effects afterwards. This can be used to manipulate the field, making your opponent cautious to destroy spell/traps as it could be a monster. If they don't destroy your cards you can't have monsters, so plenty of quick-play spells that destroy your artifact cards have been included. Because every artifact card is rank 5, it is very easy to summon Xyz monsters, so plenty of powerful Xyz monsters, along with F0 utopia and F0 draco utopia have been included. ""Artifact Failnought"" can be used to place artifact cards that are in the GY into the spell zone to be destroyed, while ""Artifact Moralttach"" is used to destroy cards your opponent controls. Another pro this deck has is that the cards that summon your artifact monsters can also destroy your opponent's spells. When playing this deck you have to make sure that you are setting the artifact monsters first and then destroying them with spells during your opponents turn to activate their effects."

(Still, Rip Lightning Storm ;_;) But even without the inclusion of a reprint for Lightning Storm, we still got amazing reprints with it, which makes it absolutely worth buying a pack of 3 of this awesome SD. Cards like ""<a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>"" and the infamous ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"". But reprints aren't everything this SD has to offer. New cards like ""<a data-name=""Cyber Eternal"">Cyber Eternal</a>"" or the Cyberdark archetypes newest Boss Monster ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark End Dragon"">Cyberdark End Dragon</a>"" are also included and give the deck a huge power boost. Anyway, I'm not going to waste more time, let's get right into the deck profile.  Be careful tho, this'll get edgy. VERY edgy. Seriously.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/00gQISR.jpg"" alt=""image"" />  Let's start with the basics. This deck is really not depending on going 1st or going 2nd. You usually got something for both cases, altho going 2nd is a bit favored, due to the deck consisting of roughly 60% Cyberdark and 40% Cyberdragon, which is usually a going 2nd deck. Anyway, what to do if you are forced to go 1st? In this scary moment you usually wanna go straight into your biggest and strongest Beast of them all: The ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark End Dragon"">Cyberdark End Dragon</a>"". This will most of the time; depending on how your starting hand looks; cost you a good bunch of resources as well as a LP amount of 2000 and will leave you with; again depending on your starting hand; the Dragon and maybe one or two more cards in form of backrow. All you need to get the Emperor Dragon out, is at least one copy of any Trap- or Spell-Card and the new (searchable) Spell-Card ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Horizon"">Cybernetic Horizon</a>"". The rest will be searchable in around 18 out of 20 cases if you don't already have it. What you gonna do is get at least 5 Cyberdark Monsters (No matter which ones) in your GY, your hand or on the field (not as equip spells!), one of them being on the field is the new Cyberdark Monster ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Chimera"">Cyberdark Chimera</a>"". This can be easily done by using the Cybernetic Horizon spell. Make sure to send ""<a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>"" from your Extra-Deck to the GY when using Horizon. Tipp: If somehow one Cyberdark monster is missing, you can also send your second Cyberdark Chimera from your deck to the graveyard to send another Cyberdark to your graveyard by using Chimeras second effect. Now use Chimeras first effect, discard the before mentioned random backrow card and search ""<a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a>"". Use Power Bond to Fusion summon ""<a data-name=""Cyberdarkness Dragon"">Cyberdarkness Dragon</a>"" by using the 5 Cyberdarks in your hand, field or by banishing them from the graveyard, which is possible thanks to Chimeras effect. Uppon summoning Cyberdarkness Dragon, use it's effect to equip Cyber End Dragon to it and then tribute it to summon your Cyberdark End Dragon. As a second option, you can also keep your 8000 ATK Cyberdarkness Dragon. Good thing about that is, that you have an omni negate for every equip card on the field. Even if there aren't any, you can use Cyber End Dragon as well, on cost of putting Cyberdarkness' ATK down to ""just"" 4000. I however, as the going first option, mostly chose to go into the Cyberdark End Dragon, since 5000 ATK combined with being completely unaffected by any activated effects from your opponent is just too good. Just keep in mind, that it won't protect it from Kaiju-like effects as well as from permanent effects or ""passive"" effects like Skill Drain. It is however protected from Super Polymerisation since it has to be activated before actually using something as Fusion material. Another good side note is that you can revive Cyberdarkness Dragon after tributing it via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Eternal"">Cyber Eternal</a>"", getting your omni negate back; this time with ""just"" 6000 ATK but still; if you manage to have it in your hand or search it via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>"". It's a very good combination with the Cyberdark End Dragon by the way, since it can constantly grab 'n' equip monsters from both graveyards, giving your Cyberdarkness Dragon more negates and gives you the possibility to pull out important monsters from your opponents graveyard interupting their plays, like Doomking Balerdroch to just name one.  So that's everything for the going first part. The going second part is actually much shorter, I promise. In this section I talk about some basic and advanced combos since the going second part is literally the whole first part if you wanna sweat a bit or just everything else the deck has to offer.  The deck focuses on literally everything that makes Cyberdark for me: Effectiveness (seriously, don't play this deck against somebody who's only out for fun and casual play, this will come of as a bit unfair), Feeling (Simping for Zane/Ryo) and semi-fun/casual play. That's why I play the deck in it's in my eyes best form, combined with Cyberdragons in the best Zane-manner. You main strategies are of course using the main Cyberdark's being ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Horn"">Cyberdark Horn</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Edge"">Cyberdark Edge</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Keel"">Cyberdark Keel</a>"". Combined with the main searchers of the deck as well as main equip monsters ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Cannon"">Cyberdark Cannon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Claw"">Cyberdark Claw</a>"", they become 2400 ATK beatsticks with additional effects. Claw is your backrow searcher and Cannon is your monster searcher. Whilst equipped with to a monster, Claw that equips and battles can send a monster from the Extra-Deck to your GY which works perfectly with ""Elder Entity N'tss"" to pop a card of choice. Another good option is ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>"", which then let's you search any Fusion spell. Just keep in mind, that a Cyber Monster send to the GY by this or Horizon's effect, can't be revived by Cyber Eternal. It ignores summoning conditions, but only the ones that are one the card but not the ones that are in the games basic rules which need you to summon a Fusion Monster properly first before you are able to revive it by other means. Cannon however let's you send a Cyberdark monster from your Deck to your GY. You may wanna use this to get easier Fusion summons since you mostly use monsters in your graveyard as material. This for the basic playstyle. Now to some ""advanced"" combos.  Starting with the whole selection of Cyberdragons. The Cyberdarks really go hand in hand with the original Cyberdragons (and even need them for Cybernetic Horizon) and you have a big pool to chose from. I go with the very core of the Cyberdragon engine being the normal set of 3 <a data-name=""Cyberdragon"">Cyberdragon</a>s, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> for the search since it can search really every Cyberdragon and Cyberdark- Spell and Trap. <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> is a beautiful combo extender about which I will talk a bit more soon. Lastly ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>"". Another choice which is enough as a one-of due to reasons I talk about later on. As I said before, you need the Light Machine engine to get Cybernetic Horizon to work which is a very important card and they also go very well with the ""Rush-Down-Beat-Down"" tactic (short: RDBD&#x2122;).  The first important combo is the usual ""Get-most-out-of-""-combo involving <a data-name=""Cybernetic Horizon"">Cybernetic Horizon</a>. The card requires you to send one of your Light and one of your Dark monsters to the GY. One from your hand and one from your Deck. It's important to send a Cyberdark monster from your hand to the graveyard to then send a Cyberdragon from your deck to the grave, which will be <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>. It's effect will activate and let you take one of the original Cyber Dragons to your hand. Right after that, you can take another ""Cyber-"" monster to your hand from your deck. You can really take everything that's name is ""Cyber..."", even the <a data-name=""Malefic Cyber End Dragon"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon</a> or cards that aren't even Cyberdragon related, like <a data-name=""Cyber Kirin"">Cyber Kirin</a>. This will give you the maximum out of your Cybernetic Horizon spell.  Lets head on to the next important piece which involves <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>. The sole purpose of this card in the deck is to add it to your hand and normal summon it to activate it's effect and make it's own Level become 5. Here again, by using Cybernetic Horizon, sending a Cyber Dragon Herz to the GY, you can add an additional default Cyber Dragon to your hand together with Cyber Dragon Drei. Summon it, then normal summon Cyber Dragon Drei to go into the Xyz-monster ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"". Infinity is an important monster removal and a strong omni negate.  Next. A way to turn this deck into a true Suicide Bomb is via ""<a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"". What's nice about this, is that it basicly comes just while playing the deck normally. You got plenty possibilities to send Chimerafflesia to the GY, to activate it's effect and search for Future Fusion. Activate it and in case it stays on the field until the next turn (Easy done when already having a Cyberdarkness Dragon out or a ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Invasion"">Cyberdark Invasion</a>"" to prevent your opponent from destroying it), you can show your opponent your ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"", dumb all Machine type monsters in your deck and then use Cyberdark Chimera's effect to get Powerbond and summon the Overdragon with your whole deck, creating a monster just with your Main Deck that can attack your opponents monsters up to 16 times, with 12800 ATK. If you use Power Bond, you got a monster with 25600 ATK. The only drawback is that you receive 12800 damage at the end of that turn, which will definetely kill you. So, pray that your attack with an enormous 25600 will hit it's target like a well-placed Predator Rocket. Cause if that won't work, you'll be dead by the end of your turn.  ...unless you use Cyber Kirin for some reason-  You can see, the target is clear. Deal huge amounts of battle damage to your opponent, until they lay in the dirt. OTK's won't be too rare. Good options if you try going for the OTK are the ""<a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>"" and the ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampagedragon"">Chimeratech Rampagedragon</a>"". Make sure to use ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>"" to tribute problematic Link monsters from your opponent. ""<a data-name=""Rebirth Judgement"">Rebirth Judgement</a>"" is not only one of Zane's cards, but a very good addition to the deck as well. You can use it to make your Cyberdark End Dragon more easy via ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Dragon"">Cyberdark Dragon</a>"". You can also reuse N'tss by equiping it again to one of your Fusion monsters to trigger the destroy effect multiple times. You can also use it to steal important monsters from your opponents graveyard in combination with ""<a data-name=""Cyberdark Realm"">Cyberdark Realm</a>"", which is also another searcher of yours. The deck is highly consistent and you will most likely never draw a dead hand.  As for the Side Deck, there is quite a plethora of options you can go with. The classical ""<a data-name=""DNA Surgery"">DNA Surgery</a>"" trick to tribute away every single monster your opponent controls for your ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>"". <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> to summon an easy <a data-name=""Cyberdragon"">Cyberdragon</a> or ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"" for more Suicide Bomb-Action. ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" is a beautiful option too since you can get rid of it easily by using Cyber Dragon Infinity's effect to take it back.

With the release of Destiny hero - Destroy Phoenix enforcer sky striker has gotten a very big boost. If you are not aware of what the card does it can Destroy one card on your field and then destroy one card on the field. Whenever it is sent to the graveyard It can revive itself during the next standby phase. While this is already a very good card on its own how does it work with virtual world enough to make them a top deck? They use artifact scythe, You can destroy the artifact scythe and a card on the opponents field which will lock them out of the extra deck. You can also destroy destroy phoenix enforcer, and link the scythe into sky striker ace zeke, getting rid of the cards in your main monster zone and 2 cards on the opponents field.  <strong>Budget options:</strong> IF you want a budget version I recommend playing a pure variant as there are not really any ways of cutting the cost, besides cutting the extra deck. If you cut destroy phoenix enforcer you are playing a deck with 8 copies of scythe and no way to pop it. If you are interested in a pure variant/Budget variant I will be making one in the near future."

With Branded Fusion, Branded Thunder Dragons turbo out multiple giganti","Branded Fusion is one of the most ridiculously powerful cards ever printed. This one card and it’s archetype, “Albaz” singlehandedly makes most fusion decks faster, stronger and more resilient. Notable decks that benefit from this branded buffoonery are Cyber Dragons, Buster Blader, and for this deck profile I’m featuring Thunder Dragons!  Losing Colossus nearly two years ago at the start of 2020 that killed the eternal “TOSS” format, Thunder Dragons have lost their meta tier 1 status and became considerably weaker as a rogue deck. Branded Fusion changes this humble status of this former heavyweight meta champion by enabling the deck viable and powerful going first and going second options!  Summon multiple gigantic draconic boss monsters, methodically decimate your opponent’s board, maintain resource advantage through both archetype’s resource loops and when the time is right - swing for game!  <span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span>  The <strong>THUNDER DRAGON</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 16 cards:  <em>3 Thunder Dragons, 3 Thunder Dragondark, 2 Thunder Dragonmatrix, 1 Thunder Dragonroar, 3 Aloof Lupine, 1 Thunder Dragon Fusion,</em> <em>2 Ready Fusion and 1 Gold Sarcophagus. </em>In the Extra Deck there are <em>2 Thunder Dragon Titan</em> and <em>1 Kaminari Attack</em>. Several extra Thunder Dragon cards are cut from this decklist like an extra copy of Matrix, Roar Thunder Dragon Fusion, and Dragonhawk to make space for staples and the Albaz cards.  The <strong>BRANDED</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 13 cards:  <em>1 Aluber the Jester of Despia, 2 Fallen of Albaz, 3 Springans Kitt, 3 Incredible Ecclesia, </em>and<em> 1 Iris Swordsoul,</em> 3 Branded Fusion<em>. </em>In the Extra Deck there are <em>3 Albion, 2 Lubellion</em>, and <em>2 Mirrorjade. 1 Starving Venom </em>and <em>1 Titaniklad </em>serve as additional “superpoly” targets for Albaz.  The <strong>SHADOLL</strong> cards are a minor package in this deck, consisting only of 2 cards: <em>Winda</em> and <em>Qashaddol Keios.</em>  The <strong>STAPLE</strong> cards in this deck take up 10 slots in this deck. <em>3 Allure of Darkness</em> serve as draw power, and 6 handtraps <em>3 Impermanence </em>and<em> 3 Dimension Shifter. 1 Called By the Grave </em>provides protection from handtraps and a potential disruption for the opponent. I chose to make the staples in this decklist affordable, but they can be replaced by more potent (and expensive) cards like Lightning Storm and Forbidden Droplet.  <span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span>  The <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong> with this deck is simple – control the board going first, and OTK going second.  If the game manages to lasts several turns, both Branded and Thunder Dragon cards recycle themselves and provide sizeable resources. At the end of every turn, Incredible Ecclesia recycles herself + Albion grabs you another Branded Fusion from deck. Thunder Dragon Fusion can also be banished the turn after you use it to allow you to search for Thunder Dragonroar, which can be discarded to recover Thunder Dragon Fusion from the banished pile. Since these two archetypes recur almost indefinitely, you should be able to outgrind your opponent in resource war.  <strong>GOING FIRST</strong>, boards that end on Thunder Dragon Titan’s destruction and Winda’s floodgate are often enough to pressure your opponent’s gameplan to a standstill.  Simply use Branded Fusion to dump to the GY the light Shadoll monster Keios to fuse into Albion, then use Albion’s effect to make Winda! Keep in mind you only have one summon to make after making Winda, so be sure to combo off properly making Thunder Dragon Titan first, then making Winda afterward.  <strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, boards are easily picked apart by Thunder Dragon’s multiple pops and Mirrorjade’s banish. Incredible Ecclesia works together with her bestie, Fallen of Albaz to “superpoly” away your opponent’s problematic monsters. All of this often accomplished without using your normal summon! After breaking an opponent’s board, this deck can easily generate enough gigantic monsters onboard to obliterate your opponent’s lifepoints in one turn.  <strong>COMBOS</strong> with this deck simple but take practice to fully master. Combos are typically hand-dependent, but end with a board full of Thunder Dragon and Branded fusion monsters. In addition to the combos featured earlier, here are some examples of additional combos:  <em>Thunder Dragon + Ready Fusion:</em> Activate Ready Fusion to summon Kaminari Attack, then special summon Thunder Dragon Titan by banishing Kaminari Attack and your Thunder Dragon in hand. It is ideal to banish Thunder Dragondark for this effect, since banishing it allows you to search for an essential Thunder Dragon combo piece like ammunition for Thunder Dragon Titan or Thunder Dragon Fusion.  <em>Albion effect  + Thunder Dragondark in GY = Search Thunder Dragon card</em>: If Thunder Dragondark is already in the GY, Albion can banish Thunder Dragondark to create Lubellion. Doing so will trigger Dragondark’s effect to search for any Thunderdragon card that you’re mission.  <em>Ready Fusion + Branded Fusion = Mirrorjade</em>: After using Ready Fusion to create Thunder Dragon Titan, a Kaminari Attack should be in the banished pile. The Branded Fusion combo line (Albion -&gt; Lubellion -&gt; Mirrorjade) can use Kaminari Attack in the banished pile as one of the materials to fuse Mirrorjade, without using up one of your Branded Dragons already on the field!  There are more situational combos that a pilot can do with this deck, but it’s largely dependent on the game state, cards in hand, and what the opponent has. That’s why it’s crucial to practice this deck so one can optimize play. I’d describe Branded Thunder Dragon as easy to play, but hard to master.  <span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Ideally, this deck can feature monsters like Dragoon, Blue Eyes Tyrant Dragon and Invoked Mechaba! All you have to do is use another garnet in your deck, The Light -Hex-Sealed Fusion, dumped off Branded Fusion for the summon of Albion. Albion then makes your fusion of choice, using Hex-Sealed’s fusion substitution ability!</li>  	<li>Your hand going second will likely have ways to fuse into your Branded and Thunder Dragon monsters, but try to bait/break your opponent’s interruption first before heading into your main plays.</li>  	<li>If you want to focus more on destroying multiple backrow, creating Thunder Dragon Titan is the ideal play, since it can pop cards on the field multiple times without targeting and can survive being destroyed multiple times (for ex. Torrential Tribute or Conquistador of the Golden Land).</li>  	<li>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer fits comfortably in this deck, but the inclusion of other cards in Branded Thunder Dragon reduces consistency, lessens access to boardbreakers, etc. If you can put this guy in your deck, I highly recommend it!</li>  	<li>Since this deck lacks an inherent normal summons and doesn’t really set cards, Denko Sekka can be sidedeck option for backrow heavy games. She is also searchable off Thunder Dragon Fusion!</li>  	<li>Chaos cards/chaos engine function wonderfully with this deck. If you’re willing to let go of staples or increase your decksize beyond 40, I recommend fitting Chaos Space, Chaos Dragon Levianeer, Chaos Creator (searchable off Thunder Dragon Fusion), Chaos Valkyria, etc.</li>  	<li>This deck is particularly weak to backrow, floodgates and high impact handtraps. Be sure to side properly to counter your opponents!</li>  	<li>When siding with this deck in-between games, the cards able to be switched the most are the 3 Allure of Darkness (sacrificing consistency), the 3 Dimension Shifter, and the Ecclesia cards (3 Incredible Ecclesia, 1 Iris Swordsoul). Replace these 10 cards with whatever you like going first or second!</li>  	<li>Dimension Shifter works incredibly well with this deck. Careful of using this card since it cuts off some combo lines for both Thunder Dragon and Branded!</li>  	<li>The Branded Albaz and Lubellion require a discard for their cost, and Thunder Dragons provide ample fodder for discards. Dragondark especially loves being in the GY, since it can potentially be banished by Albion’s effect, triggering Dragondark’s search effect.</li>  	<li>Verte Anaconda can be used should you lack access to either Branded or Thunder Dragon fusion. Just keep in mind you can’t summon Verte the same turn you used Branded Fusion since you’re locked into fusion extra deck monsters for the rest of the turn.</li>  	<li>Lubellion can recycle any monster cards used for its fusion effect in the GY or banished pile, including Thunder Dragon monsters. Keep this in mind if you’re running out of particular cards in your maindeck/extra deck!</li> </ul> <span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>  The synergy between these decks almost seem like these two archetypes were designed to support each other! For example, Branded Fusion mills Thunder Dragons to the GY, Albion banishes Thunder Dragons in the GY to fuse while triggering their effects, Mirrorjade recycles Extra Deck monsters in the banished pile, Thunder Dragons maintain hand advantage serving as discard fodder for Branded cards… The synergies between these two are incredible!  I’ve enjoyed the simple control/beatdown strategy of Thunder Dragons for years, combining it with multiple different variants such as Chaos and Rokket to propel this deck forward. With their new bestie Albaz and friends, Thunder Dragons gains an entirely new dimension of power and playability! Who knows, maybe in the future Thunder Dragons may reclaim it’s mantle of tier 1 meta deck once more! <span>Just please don’t unleash Thunder Dragon Colossus again Konami, that card was ridiculous.</span>"

If you need to end the duel faster, we also have Geomathmech Final Sigma, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning, and Gren Maju de Eiza. If you want to make your opponent hate your very existence, we have Number 90, Number 23, Number 68, and Macro Cosmos.  However, if you want to use Macro Cosmos, make sure you already have The Chaos Creator on the field, and also preferably Chaos Zone as well. This way you can just recycle your monsters endlessly.  However, it only really works if you already have a lead and want to prevent a comeback. Also, this lets your Gren Maju easily get tons and tons of attack.  This deck does take 2 or 3 turns to really pop off, so that's why we have cards like Geomathmech final sigma to help stall until you can get Chaos Zone and The Chaos Creator."

If you have not played yugioh for the last 2 years and don't know what Eldlich does, here is a quick summary. Sit behind your traps until you get access to eldlich, then summon eldlich grind a little bit, whenever your opponent is weak go in for game with Eldlich, Superdrednaughts, or accesscode talker.  <strong>Budget options:</strong>If you want to play budget this is an easy deck to do it with. You can cut the pot of extravagance for more traps which will save you around 36 dollars on a deck that is already relativity cheap, You can always cut the side deck. If you can not afford/ dont want to play Ice dragons prison then you can cut it for dimensional barrier, or drowning mirror force, this is the same with skill drain, the artifact cards, or any cards that you find to expensive. If you can not afford the accescode talker cut it for borrelsword, or the knightmare Cerberus.  <strong>Combo:</strong> Set five pass. Combo 2 normal summon ecclisia, search dogmatika punishment, set 5 pass.  <strong>Interesting tech:</strong> The artifact cards. I am playing the artifact cards, because 1 you can pop it with N'tss, 2 what are people siding in against you games 2, and 3, backrow removal so even if you draw it, they will more than likely lock themselves out of the extra deck."

Absolutely not in fact it is one of the top 3 decks in yugioh right now. The deck got a big boost from the release of destiny hero destroy phoenix enforcer. So what does the deck do? The deck is an anti combo deck, with its typical end board being some variation of Invoked mechaba- Shaddoll Winda- and/or Destiny hero destroy phoenix enforcer. The deck is also consistant since all 3 engines only need one card to get to there boss part, Invoked only needs Aleister, magical meltdown, or terraforming. Dogmatika only needs nadir servant, ecclisia, or dogmatika maximus. And destiny hero only needs fusion destiny or access to verte.  <strong>Note:</strong> You can only summon hero monsters after you use fusion destiny, so you should use it at the end of your combo, or if you bricked.  <strong>Combo:</strong> You can normal summon aleister, search invocation. Link aliester into artemis, or almiraj, and then secure gardna, then activate invocation using aliester and a light monster""Secure gardna, Artemis"" And summon invoked mechaba. Then activate invocation in grave to add aliester to the hand and shuffle itself into the deck. For dogmatika you can use nadir servant to search, ecclisia to search maximus, summon maximus pitch shaddoll apkolone, and gravity controller. Apkollone will search the shaddoll schism, set schism, and the non your opponents turn you can use schism to summon winda. Destiny hero Activate verte send fusion destiny and the two destiny hero monsters, summon destroy phoenix enforcer.  <strong>Budget Options: </strong>If you can not afford this deck you can, cut the droll for effect veiler which will save 45 dollars. You can cut the destiny hero package which will take off 150 dollars, You can cut the dogmatika engine for just shaddoll cards, this will take off around 75 dollars off. If you cut the nibiru in the extra deck for dogmatika punishment it will save 33 dollars."

You will see today.,"This deck is focused on sylvan as a strategy. Not plant dot deck  New Sylvan link monster--&gt; best gambling deck ever. Just excavate and see how you gain advantage. Hard to say a strategy but... Go sylvan link, undead vampire, chaos ruler, and aromaseraphy to set up board with whatever happens.  Never add anything with chaos ruler. There is not a target more fun in grave than in hand.  Apollousa is a good endboard if you have random stuff you think won't help.  Use the plant Therion as searcher for field spell by sending whatever you equip, then use as material for rank 8, plant link or synchro fodder. Field spell can find the machine therion to equip the plant therion.  Always try to summon something form grave with undead vampire effects, including opponents cards. that why its is not a plant only extra deck."

This is really a wonderful game. Drytron has been around the meta since its release, at first it did stuff and then put up an extra deck lock, now it puts up negates and locks people out of the extra deck.  <strong>Combo: </strong>I recommend going to youtube to find the combo for this deck because it is kind of long.  <strong>Budget options:</strong> IF you can not afford the destiny hero package then you can drop it and the artifact package for herald of perfection, its ritual spell and preparation of rites. If you can not afford triple tactics talents then you can cut it for forbidden chalice. IF you can not afford accesscode talker you can cut it for boorelsword/borreload dragon. IF you can not afford ash blossom you can cut it for effect veiler. IF you can not afford Zues then you can cut him for knightmare Cerberus. IF you can not afford the Diviner of herald, then you can cut it for a megaliath package, 2 phul, 1 bethor, and 1 Ophiel.  IF you can not afford drytron nova I do not recomend this deck, but you could also cut this for the megaliath package or the herald of perfection pakcage. IF you can not afford the Droll, or nibiru I suggest playing effect veiler, or kaijus."

Synchro <a data-name=""Vahram,"">Vahram,</a> makes any equipped monster a ""Battle Phase <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a></span> eff"" protected from Spell/Trap Destruction so you can equip it on small attack monsters and be able to take out much stronger monsters in battle. Together with <a data-name=""Ninaruru,"">Ninaruru,</a> it gets even better because you can attack monsters twice. <a data-name=""Rilliona,"">Rilliona,</a> in Grind Game you add <a data-name=""Vritra"">Vritra</a> and do LINK-1 and activate Vritra Reborn <a data-name=""Zoroa,"">Zoroa,</a> to trigger eff <a data-name=""Artemis,"">Artemis,</a> to equip and then use Zoroa to reborn. Equipping Fusion <a data-name=""Aiwass,"">Aiwass,</a> already guarantees you to take out several monsters in battle as well as <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> </span>by Boost 1000ATK/DEF. F<a data-name=""orbidden Droplet"">orbidden Droplet</a> is not bad to use in this deck because you have the option to send Equip Spells to the GY as a cost. If you can get to 2 Level4 without Normal Summoning as Vritra Reborn Rilliona and Search <a data-name=""Trismagistus"">Trismagistus</a> and use to Special Level4 Spellcaster from Hand you can make <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru</a> to add Zoroa back to Hand to use as your Normal Summon. Don't Forget <a data-name=""Trismagistus"">Trismagistus</a> protects destruction from Battle. Also don't forget that in cases where it's not important to keep Artemis equipped on Endymion (pretty much whenever you're not using Invocation to Fusion) you use <a data-name=""Endymion, the Magistus"">Endymion, the Magistus</a> <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit</a> effect to filter the top of your deck and improve your hand. You cannot use Artemis in the Spell&amp;Trap Zone as a cost to pay <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus"">Crowley, the Magistus</a> Special Summon effect from the hand because it is considered an Equip Spell and not a Spellcaster monster.  A really cool move to make with <a data-name=""Zoroa,"">Zoroa,</a> is to equip <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru</a>, and use Reborn's effect and then use Ninaruru's effect to destroy itself and an opponent's spell/trap. That way you practically have a <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> in the engine itself to use every turn in a very simple way. I've already managed to destroy a lot of floodgate with this effect for example.  Missplays I made with the deck: You activated <a data-name=""Impermanence"">Impermanence</a> set and equipped Artemis in the same column as Impermanence was activated so that means Artemis has her Equip Spell effect negated. Choosing to use Xyz Rilliona's effect early in the turn and thus not being able to make Bagooska. When you choose to play <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and go to the battle phase and in M2 do <a data-name=""Toadally"">Toadally</a> and <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> always detach Endymion because otherwise you won't have follow up to add to the hand with Toad eff in GY."

It literally does everything and is way too easy to build into. I mean please at least give it some kind of actual cost for its effect since you want frogs in your graveyard. Oh, what's that? You got through the 20000 negates on board? Have some handtraps while I salt some popcorn with the salt from your tears because I feel like it!  Ok, I'm done with my extremely immature rant."

All the trap cards, with the exception of Assault Mode Activate are simply filler and are not part of the engine.  The Psi-Reflector engine is comparable to the Invoked engine in that you can use your normal summon to make a powerful monster.  With one card, you can make almost any level 6-9 synchro monster as long as it has generic requirements. The advantages it has over Invoked is that it is searchable by Emergency Teleport and One for One, so it can be used without taking up your normal summon, which Invoked can not, but does require to run more bricks and cards in general.  The main sequence of play with this engine is to summon Psi-Reflector and search Assault Beast. You then discard Assault Beast to search Assault Mode Activate. Then, you use Psi-Reflector to revive Assault Beast through its effect by revealing Activate, increasing its level depending on the synchro monster you want to summon, and then synchro summoning the said monster.  If you synchro summon Power Tool Dragon, you can use it’s effect to grab Living Fossil and summon back Reflector, and then make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. This lets you play it in a wide variety of decks to gain a hard to beat over boss monster with a monster negate."

","A deck specifically made for the ""Common Charity"" format that is officially supported by Konami. This format only uses cards that come in the <em>common</em> rarity.  Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!  Paleozoic Volcanic controls the field with multiple fieldwipes with the Volcanic engine. This is done by dumping Blaze Accelerator Reload through Foolish Burial Goods and Paleozoic Marella. Blaze Accelerator Reload in turn dumps Volcanic Scattershot. This engine is recycled by Royal Firestorm Guards, the pyro ""Pot of Avarice."" Blaze Accelerator Reload serves as a draw engine on the field, turning a Volcanic card into another potential purple card to control the board.  Meantime, the board is simultaneously controlled with various forms of Paleozoic interruption. Dinomischus banishes, Canadia flips face down and Olenoides destroys backrow. When a trap card is activated, Paleozoic cards summon themselves from the GY as 1200ATK monsters.  While unaffected by monster effects, Paleozoic cards have low attack. That is offset with Moon Mirror Shield + Armory Call, which gives you a towers-like boss monster immune to monster effects and unkillable in battle. In Common Charity format where monster effects and beatdown are crucial, Paleozoic monsters equipped with Moon Mirror Shield are ridiculously powerful.  Since the traditional Paleozoic XYZ monsters are unavailable as common, Number 29: Mannequin Cat is the XYZ substitute, which can generate card advantage as a Monster Reborn. Paleozoic Cambroraster searches for any Paleozoic card with it's effect, and is good protection for backrow. These are the two best Extra Deck monsters used most often. The other Extra Deck monsters are just filler, which can be made in niche situations.  Common Charity is a breathe of fresh air in the face of Yugioh's often stale meta, I encourage duelists to try it out! It's honestly the most fun I've had in Yugioh in a while!"

Currently, Zefra is in an utterly unplayable state and physically cannot win games without relying on several busted-ass crutches to accomplish anything. Konami, make Pendulums great again.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Halqifibrax Combo:</strong></span>  The main goal of this deck is to turbo out <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Crystron Halqifibrax&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> </a>and go into an Auroradon combo to set up at least 3 negates, taking so much time doing the combo that your opponent would wish they'd never entered your lobby. For those that know the combo, don't even bother reading anything listed below, and for those that for some God-forsaken reason have no clue how to do the Halq combo, you'd better get comfortable, because you're about to read some real bullshit. <ol>  	<li>Summon the materials needed for <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>. This is done by using <strong><a data-name=""Zefraxi, Treasure of the Yang Zing"">Zefraxi, Treasure of the Yang Zing</a></strong> which has the effect that when Pend Summoned, it can turn any <strong>Zefra</strong> monster you control into a tuner. The best monster to summon alongside Zefraxi is <strong><a data-name=""Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing"">Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</a></strong>, off which you will search <strong><a data-name=""Zefra War"">Zefra War</a></strong> for an additional interruption. If you're <em><strong>desperate</strong></em>, normal summoning a handtrap is a completely viable option. <strong>Do not summon more than 2 monsters onto the board as all zones will be used during this combo.</strong></li>  	<li>Activate Halq, summoning <strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a></strong></li>  	<li>Using Halq and 001, link summon <strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a></strong>, and activate its effect to summon 3 tokens. Activate Deskbot 001.</li>  	<li>Using 001 and a token, summon <strong><a data-name=""Cupid Pitch"">Cupid Pitch</a></strong>. Activate Cupid's effect and choose to gain a level.</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Auroradon</strong>, choosing his second effect to tribute two tokens and summon <strong><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a></strong> from your deck. Activate Coltwing to summon 2 tokens alongside 001.</li>  	<li><strong>You must do the following steps in order or you'll mess up the combo, and look like a complete idiot in front of your opponent. </strong>Using your L5 Cupid Pitch and a Token, summon <strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong>. I've personally seen it happen, so I'll remind you right now to activate Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Activate Cupid Pitch from the graveyard, searching <strong><a data-name=""Creation Resonator"">Creation Resonator</a>, </strong>and immediately Special Summon it from hand (Borrelsavage is a L8 DARK Dragon).</li>  	<li>Using Creation Resonator and Coltwing, summon <strong><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></strong>.</li>  	<li>Summon <strong><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></strong> using a token and 001.</li>  	<li>Watch Opponent scoop, effectively having made you play solitaire.</li> </ol> <strong><em>Oh no! What if Halqifibrax is negated???</em></strong>  Halqifibrax is the most fucking telegraphed chokepoint in the world, and your opponent might need to get checked if they don't shotgun the Ash or Imperm on it. This is where <strong><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> </strong>comes in. If you did not draw Crossout, remain calm and follow these steps: <ul>  	<li>In most scenarios, you do not expend your Normal Summon. In this case, simply normal summon a monster from your hand and summon Verte to make <strong><a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong>.</li>  	<li>If you hard draw <strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong>, just hard activate it and make DPE.</li>  	<li>If neither option is available to you, these following options are still open: <ul>  	<li>Set Zefra War and pray to God a single pop is enough to stop your opponent.</li>  	<li>Draw enough handtraps to hopefully hamper your opponent.</li>  	<li>Apologise to Trif for playing this abomination.</li>  	<li>Scoop.</li>  	<li>Just draw Fusion Destiny 5head.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span><strong>Actual Zefra Stuff</strong></span>  If you draw a hand that physically cannot go into Halqifibrax, and you deem that Verte is not the right play, your next best card is <strong>Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</strong>. It deadass searches your entire deck upon Pend Summon or destruction (if you need a Zefra monster, add <strong><a data-name=""Zefra Providence"">Zefra Providence</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra"">Oracle of Zefra</a></strong>). Generally, if you need to squeeze as many interactions out of Zefraniu as possible, add <strong>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</strong>, and when Zefraniu is destroyed during the next turn from Nine Pillars, you add <strong>Zefra War</strong> (this card can be used from hand if you have Zefras in both pend zones).  Whatever you do, don't actually summon <strong><a data-name=""Zefraath"">Zefraath</a> </strong>from your face-up Extra Deck. After the Great Pendulum Purge of MR4, this card has become <em><strong>dogshit useless</strong></em>. As it summons from your Extra-Deck, it must go into a Linked Zone, and the fucker tributes the <strong>entire field, </strong>leaving the only available zone the Extra Monster Zone. This means that you literally cannot use its second effect that grants a second Pendulum Summon each turn, making it little more than a fat body. The only exception is when your Opponent has a link arrow that points into one of your zones.  The remainder of the Zefra monster lineup is entirely down to personal preference. You can even replace Zefracore and Zefrathuban with other generic cards if you were insane enough.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Mildly-to-Extremely Questionable Picks</strong></span>  <strong><a data-name=""Zefra Metaltron"">Zefra Metaltron</a></strong>: He is literally here for flavor points. There is probably a better monster to play over Metaltron for the link arrows. Hell, even Draco Master of the Tenyi is probably better...  <strong><a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a></strong>: This is a flex spot. You can literally play whatever the hell you want here. I just like Bagooska as it induces copious amounts of salt. Save some fees on salt. College has ways to make a man broke.  <strong>Knightmare Package</strong>: More flex spots. Knightmares are generically good in most situations, but you can play whatever you desire.  <strong>Accesscode</strong>: Ditto.  <strong><a data-name=""Zefra Path"">Zefra Path</a></strong>: This is strictly a Side Deck option. If you are playing against a deck that <em>does</em> get utterly cucked by this floodgate, you can side it in and search it off Zefraniu.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Terrible Ideas to</strong> <strong>Consider:</strong></span>  Here are some (probably) absolutely awful ideas to try out if you're trying to actively make your deck worse.  <strong><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a></strong>: You can make this off <strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Zefranaga"">Shaddoll Zefranaga</a> </strong>and <strong><a data-name=""Zefrasaber, &lt;a data-name=&quot;Swordmaster of the Nekroz&quot;&gt;Swordmaster of the Nekroz&lt;/a&gt;"">Zefrasaber, </a><a data-name=""Swordmaster of the Nekroz"">Swordmaster of the Nekroz</a></strong>. Why anyone would do this, I couldn't quite say. In the case that you don't play Halqifibrax on turn 1, you can summon Halq, pulling an <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong> from your deck. From there, you summon Selene, use Selene's effect to revive the Veiler and make an Accesscode, I guess.  <strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong>: After being Semi-Limited, Dragoon may actually be a decent consideration over DPE. However, there is still a decent probability of hard drawing the Fusion Destiny, so it's really your call at this point.  <strong>My old Halq</strong> <strong>Combo:</strong> Replace Baronne de Fleur with <strong><a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Arcethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Arcethys</a></strong>, slot in a <strong><a data-name=""Metaphys Horus"">Metaphys Horus</a></strong> in the ED, and replace Creation Resonator with <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Hop Ear Squadron&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong></a>. My old guide covers this combo, but I'll just paste it here: <ol>  	<li><span>Get a monster and a tuner on board, and only those 2 monsters. Resist the urge to pendulum summon everything out of hand. If you're desperate, the handtraps are tuners.</span></li>  	<li><span>Summon <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>, activate its trigger effect to summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> from deck.</span></li>  	<li><span>Link for <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Auroradon</strong>, summon 3 tokens, then summon 001 from GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Using a token and 001, summon <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>.</span></li>  	<li><span>Using Auroradon's 2nd effect, tribute 2 tokens to summon <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Coltwing</strong>. Coltwing effect for 2 tokens, and summon 001 from GY again.</span></li>  	<li><span>001 and token to summon <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>, choose to <strong>increase</strong> level.</span></li>  	<li><span>Level 5 Cupid Pitch and token for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>, equip Halq. Use Cupid Pitch's effect to search <strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong>.</span></li> </ol> <span>During your Opponent's turn, you can use Hop Ear in order to Synchro Summon for <strong>Metaphys Horus</strong> for an additional negate. Keep in mind that Metaphys Horus' negate is an on-summon trigger, <strong>so it will not go on the same chain.</strong></span>  <span>In the case that 001 is negated by either Ghost Belle or Skull Meister after Auroradon summons 3 tokens, <strong>you can either</strong>: use Auroradon to tribute 2 tokens and summon Coltwing, and summon the 001. From here, you make Cupid Pitch and do the standard combo to make a Borrelsavage. Then, you can use the Hop Ear you searched to summon <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</strong> at the start of your Opponent's MP1 using Hop Ear and Coltwing.</span>  <span><strong>OR</strong>: Choose to reduce the level of Cupid Pitch, and then synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon with 3 materials to draw 2 cards. Then use Hop Ear to make Horus during Opponent's turn.</span>  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Nekroz of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Unicore&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Nekroz of</strong> <strong>Unicore</strong></a>: Look, all I'm saying is that Arc Light can search a ritual, and Zefra is totally capable of playing a ritual.  <strong>More Zefras</strong>: If you prefer flavor over playability, you can totally replace DPE, Handtraps, and more with even more Zefras. The only merit is that you have more scales to draw and might be able to make halq more frequently? idk, but hey, you do you.  <strong>*<a data-name=""Tierra, Source of Destruction"">Tierra, Source of Destruction</a></strong>: For anyone who has read the Yugioh wiki, the tips page for Tierra suggests that you play her in Zefra. Unfortunately, this is outdated advice from MR3, and this is no longer viable (not that it ever was.) But I'm not your dad, if you're determined to make this work, then go ahead. Hell, I'll paypal five bucks to anyone who manages this in an actual game.  &nbsp;  Yeah, that's about it. If you want a good Pendulum deck, you're looking in the wrong places. Go watch Trif."

Hit with BIG NUMBER and OTK!","A deck specifically made for the ""Common Charity"" format that is officially supported by Konami. This format only uses cards that come in the <em>common</em> rarity.  Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!  This list is an almost identical list of the Duelist Bombderday who achieved a top 8 in the ""Common Charity 2"" out of 64 players.  Forced to only use common cards, Cyber Dragon loses key combo pieces like Galaxy Soldier and Cyber Herz. Not only that, Cyber Dragon loses its main boss monster, Cyber Dragon Infinity. With It's signature control card out of the format, Cyber Dragons only have one option - HIT WITH BIG NUMBER.  This deck aims to go second, opting to completely obliterate the opponent's lifepoints after breaking their board/backrow. Currently the meta in Common Charity consists of a lot of potent backrow like Solemns, Torrential Tribute, Compulse, etc. so x3 Hey! Trunade serves as this deck's backrow removal. Chimeratech Rampage Dragon also destroys backrow with it's on-summon ability. Monster board breakers in this deck consist of  Jizukiru (searcheable off of Cyber Repair Plant) and x3 Forbidden Chalice.  Combos with this deck are hand dependent, simple and straightforward, but the goal is always the same - summon lots of Cyber Dragons after breaking your opponent's board and OTK. Hands with Cyber Emergency/Cyber Dragon Core + Machine Duplication are essentially full combo.  The Extra Deck features the standard Cyber Dragon monsters, except without Infinity. The only unusual monster is Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine, which is summonable if your Cyber Dragon Nova gets sent to the GY.  This deck doesn't really do well in a grindgame, so make sure to destroy your opponent's lifepoints quickly and efficiently before they bounce back and force you in a unpleasant losing situation.  Common Charity is a breathe of fresh air in the face of Yugioh's often stale meta, I encourage duelists to try it out! It's honestly the most fun I've had in Yugioh in a while!"

This format only uses cards that come in the <em>common</em> rarity.</div> </div> </div> Here is a bit of a simpler deck explanation as opposed to my 2000 word+ articles. I'm gonna pump out quite a bit of Common Charity guides in the near future for the sake of this young and exciting format!  Inspired by the surprisingly successful <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Trap Machina list</a> that topped PAK's LCS Tourney, Machina Train Control copies that strategy, geared for Common Charity!  Losing the resource/boardwipe loop that Machina is famous (Machina Citadel) and its primary searcher (Machina Redeployment) this deck is focused lesser on a Machina strategy but more towards trains. Control the board with Traps and Trains, and grind your opponent out in a resource war!  Designed to turbo out its nigh invincible boss monster Number 81, Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora, the strategy of this deck is a ""protect the castle"" strategy - Sit on a unaffected high attack monster while backed with trap cards. Even if Super Dora is taken out, this deck easily can make it again, especially with access to its fieldspell, Revolving Switchyard.  The traps used in this deck feature some of the most ridiculous floodgates in the game, completely shutting down opponent's plays while your plays are unhindered. Gozen Match shuts down most ""meta"" Common Charity decks like Tenyi and Lunalight. Imperial Order and Anti-Spell Fragrance prevent spell cards from being used.  Machina Overdrive turns any machine into Machina Fortress, a strong boss monster on its own right. Since this deck features many high level machine monsters, Fortress is easily summonable from the hand or GY. Gearframe and Unclaspare also give access to Fortress, since they both foolish burial Fortress to the GY. In the grindgame, Fortress almost always trades more often in your favour, due to it's effects when destroyed by battle or targeted by card effect.  In the grind game, Time Thief Redoer is KING in Common Charity, and he can be made easily with Machine Gearframe + Machine Unclaspare. Other rank 4 options are available, depending on the situation.  The trap cards Crackdown, Torrential Tribute, Judgment and Strike are chosen since they are the highest impact cards that trade positively for the player using them. Torrential Tribute can be used without destroying Super Dora since it can be chained with it's own effect to be immune to Torrential's fieldwipe.  Overall, the gameplan of this deck is to force out a grindgame with a towers monster (Super Dora) and win in a battle of attrition with Fortress. All of this is accomplished with oppressive floodgates which block your opponent's play, while methodically picking them apart with high impact trap cards.  Common Charity is a breathe of fresh air in the face of Yugioh's often stale meta, I encourage duelists to try it out! It's honestly the most fun I've had in Yugioh in a while!"
