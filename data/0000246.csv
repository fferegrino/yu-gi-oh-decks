Oh, yeah, it's also a Fabled deck. Well, turns out Fateful Adventure effect to send a card from your hand to the GY, while not triggering your Fabled effects, does set you up to start your combos with Abanc, Krus or Kushano."

It's used outside of the theme it was made for, but I'm using Necrovalley in it.

I'm returning to the theme I had as my main deck in 2009 and the years following that. This is the first 'proper' deck I completed in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel.

I have used this deck in a duel video on Youtube: <a href=""https://youtu.be/lbK0HOQ-Q2o"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">https://youtu.be/lbK0HOQ-Q2o</a>
It will be used in many videos going forward, so you will be able to see it in action more regularly."

However as a long time lover of the Gravekeeper archetype I have toyed  and  fiddled with this deck to try and find a good balance of searching cards (Recruiter/Headman/Commandant)  &amp; ways to counter and clear the opponents field (Descendant/Supernaturalist).

I physically have all of these cards in my deck that I use to play locally and with friends.

Any help with this deck will be appreciated and I don't want to run Dragoon like everyone else who tries to make GK work."

Use some deck manipulation with slash draw to one-shot your opponent for the otk. This deck has a ton of card draw and can FTK but I won't label it as an ""FTK"" because that would be misleading.

Here is the combo: Use top share and place slash draw on top of your deck, set Big Eye, Use book of Taiyou to flip Big eye face up, place slash draw on the space that would be active (I can't describe it so read the card and how it works), set every card in your hand that you can (leave 1 spell/trap space open), and finally activate slash draw for a ton of damage.

The combo can also be done in other ways like just going for the big eye and hoping for a slash draw since it's just a great way to set up the cards that you draw next if you whiff.

This deck is built very similarly to an exodia deck but requires less specific cards in hand for the combo."

The adverse side effects of high expectation includes depression, agony, and something to do with being slightly bipolar (not to say I am or not). Three years after getting new support for this archetype, the adverse technicality still holds up; but with cards like Nibiru, Forbidden Droplet/Chalice, and infinite impermanence being staples, the deck would struggle more than ever. Luckily there is a market to improve this, and hundreds of people would pull stupid shit for fifteen seconds of fame. That being said this is the post mortem of Magical Musketeers.

In reality, the deck wasn't too hard to make nor play by my own virtue. Rather than trying solely to focus on making the deck as pure as a prostitute on a Sunday, I insist to find some strengths and weakness to make use of a card known as ""Crossout Designator"". So by adding cards like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Imperm, and Forbidden Droplet this would allow the deck to somewhat dodge these as due to negations from some of these most played cards are their weaknesses. Another factor of their issues is the lack of OTK preparations to which ""Magical Musket - Crooked Crown"" and ""Borrelsword Dragon"" has done a good job in doing so. Finally comes card recovery in all forms, which wasn't too big of a deal to solve so I used ""Pot of Avarice"", ""Daigusto Emeral"", and ""Magical Musketeer - Wild"" to allow the recoveries to be slightly easier. Also included was the Phoenix Enforcer package, which has become a staple of sorts with just about everyone these past few months."

Just getting back into the game, and this was one of my first ideas for a build so I went with it.

Pretty standard cyber dragon build- Get monsters out on the field, go into predaplant for chimera, or galaxy soliders into xyz for infinity. Eternity for protection, Sieger for big damage. pretty typical CyDra OTK strategy.

The Dogmatika engine is interesting to me. Ecclesia seems like a good level 4 and can get into utopia for the double or nothing 10k attack, and fleur/maximus are good level 8's for dingirsu for protection.

Zeus and Relinquished for the ""Oh S***"" moments."

Enjoy the 6 more weeks of winter with this deck!,"Welp, this is my first post, more than likely not my last. Someone told me about Rikka and I immediately fell in love with the artwork and theme and pretty much cooked up this list immediately, in no way should this list be considered a final build. I noticed Rikka by themselves orient more towards control, but you can definitely turn them into a monster combo deck that can set you up insane board presence to wipe out your opponent or hold the line with their tribute effects. Also there's plenty of room with their typing, being water AND plants opens up insane options, I wanted to lay more into the plant side of things but there's plenty of water support to be considered as well. I had a ton of fun brewing with these cards and I plan on crafting this deck on Master Duel to see how it fares against the world! This one's for Horohoro and his endless field of butterbur! ... Or Something. Anyways, here's the list.

1x Tytannial, Princess of Camelias: One of the star techs of the deck, I'm a huge fan of the Plant Princesses and even though they aren't in archetype, all of them being Level 8 Plants allows them to synergize well with the main cast with relative ease. Tytannial works as a target negate, and is based after one of my favorite flowers. you can replace this with other cards like any of the other Princesses we don't run or something else like Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light.

1x Talaya, Princess of Cherry Blossoms: My other Princess tech and my favorite of the 4. Provides extra effect destruction protection which I always like to have more of, but feel free to experiment with other options.

1x Hellebore the Rikka Fairy: even though she's my personal favorite main deck monster, multiples will feel cloggy and we already run Camelia anyway. It is nice that she summons herself back for a tribute, I just wish it was a quick effect. You COULD get away with not running her, but just imagine how sad she'd be if you didn't use her at all. :'(

1x Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy: Extends and sets up your xyz plays, you could run more than 1 but it's not entirely necessary.

1x Erica the Rikka Fairy: Rikkas have a battle handtrap! That summons itself back! How cool is that?!

1x Mudan the Rikka Fairy: Adds a Rikka spell or trap to hand when you summon her, probably why she doesn't float back?

3x Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy: Tributes itself to reduce 2 levels, also brings itself back. you could replace this with another water level 4 to make Bahamut Shark but I decided to stick in house for theme-based fun.

3x Primula the Rikka Fairy: Summons itself from hand when another card gets tributed, also increases the levels of your plants by 2, this with evil thorn or lonefire is insane and she's really useful for facilitating other combos as well. arguably the most important Rikka card mechanically so definitely run her at 3

1x Rose Girl: Recyclable Halq target, level 3 for access to level 7 synchro plays.

3x Lonefire Blossom: The ultimate enabler for plants. tributes itself to summon ANY plant from the deck.

1x Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring: feels necessary but not in multiples since Called by hits Maxx C.

1x Spore: Same as Rose Girl but you can make Queen of Thorns with it. also an excellent One for One target.

3x Evil Thorn: Does petty burn damage and pulls 2 from deck making it a free Jasmine most of the time. this is what you;re aiming for with Lonefire and one for one if you don't get a copy in hand.

1x Copy plant: Extra Halq target but can realistically be anything. Go nuts.

1x Rikka Petal: Wittle beebee Rikka! Searches for a Rikka monster and summons itself if you only control plants, not terrible, basically a plant Treeborn Frog.

1x Rikka Flurries: Oh how fickle can they be, amirite? *shot* Forces your opponent to tribute a monster if you tribute a rikka but if you decide to go further into the extra deck it'll destroy itself at the end of your opponent's turn, definitely think before dropping this card, another spell could be reduced for this but I wouldn't try to rely on this one as amazing as the artwork is.

1x Harpies Feather Duster: Wipe up that backrow hate, skill drain is at 3 and vanity's is legal in Master Duel so we definitely want to keep the opponent's reverse cards in check.

1x One for One: One card in hand for a level 1, very fair trade considering 1 level 1 = huge profit. EZ math.

1x Monster Reborn: clutch extender or can revive a Princess

1x Pot of Avarice:Shuffe 5 monsters in grave to the deck or extra to draw 2. Recursion and draw, why be Extravagant?

3x Rikka Glamour: Searches a Rikka and lets you tribute to search any plant. It's really in here more for the second effect than the first to get out a Princess.

2x Called By the Grave: My favorite quick play spell currently since it checks so many things by removing a monster in grave from play AND negating that card's effects. Eldlich and Striker hate this card along with every handtrap amongst other things.

2x Enemy Controller (?!): this can be anything, I just figured it'd be fun to steal my opponents' things mid combo. a better card might be trade-in, ice dragons prison, imperm, but this is for the brave.

2x Twin Twisters: chainable hate for backrow hate.

2x Rikka Sheet: Catch your opponent's monster slippin' and negate its effects, or tribute a plant to make it slide on over to your side of the field for the turn and turn it into a plant.

1x Rikka Tranquility: Rikkursion (see what I did there?). If you tribute a plant you can get another one with the Rikka you summon off this, meaning you can spot dodge amongst other things.

&nbsp;

EXTRA DECK

1x Borrelload Savage Dragon: this can be anything else but since you'll probably send jasemine to make needlefiber why not turn it into 2 monster negates?

1x Perrialis, Empress of Blossoms: Can net you a princess or more fuel to tribute

1x Queen of Thorns: Burn your opponent for playing the game. I might switch Tytannial to Marina to protect this because it makes the other player stop to think for a second, 1000 LP is a lot

1x T. G. Wonder Magician : can be any other tuner synchro, it's just nice to be able to pop things.

1x Sacred Beast Hyperyton: Can detech an xyz to negate a card as the same one attached and can attach something from grave every turn, even more reason to try ouy Marina Princess of sunflowers. We make this by tributing Strenna with an xyz material

1x Teardrop the Rikka Queen: That art. &lt;3 That aside her effect to target and tribute anything on either player's turn is amazing. might drop the bahamut shark gimmick for another one of her and Strenna

1x Kanzashi the Rikka Queen; turns herself into a literal monster reborn if something gets tributed, also protects your board further which is nice

1x Bahamut Shark: makes Toad. that's it.

1x Bagooska the Terribly Tired Taper: make everything take a nap in an emergency.

1x Rikka Queen Strenna: lets you pick up a Rikka monster in grave and if she's tributed makes a bigger xyz with her as material. Hyperyton is her best buddy

1x Toadally Awesome: Shark makes this. this negates things. that's kind of it.

1x Hope harbinger Titanic Galaxy: Negates spells and forces your opponent to target it for attacks. If only he was a plant.

1x Aromaseraphy Jasmine: the link we aim for. lets you tribute a plant for any plant like lonefire.

1x Crystron Halqufibrax: Sets up synchro plays, also summons Wonder magician in emergencies'

Masquerade is efficient at controlling combo decks like PK, Tribri, Invoked. There is a high chance of summoning all 3 that we have in the extra deck so that the opponent thinks very well if he wants to activate each effect.

the key here is to fill grave and extra with metalfoes monster while summoning metalfoes fusion monster. summon alkahest is high priority. mithrilium for recrycling and to combo with vanisher so you can banish opponents monster every turn. necro fusion and super polymerization is the best disruption and board breaker to control opponent's field.

metalfoes also a deck that can make a OTK combo if its not disrupted. but it has a weakness againts mass removal backrow. so make a defense board with metalfoes counter, metalfoes fusion, and bismugear is the best to comeback at the next turn.

you can also mixed it later with fluffal, prank, eldlich, true draco, tenyi, or inzektor if you are bored with pure metalfoes... but if you new to this archetype, i recommend you to play pure first due to many rulings that can help you gain advantage."

The usual Gren Maju players are here with some token generators. Ash Blossom and Lighting Storm/Harpie's are interchangeable with other hand traps/techs or even another Left Arm Offering.</p>
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The objective as always is to banish cards and get out Gren Maju - The tokens can be used to link into Zeroboros with either a 1 star + Skyblaster or a flipped Scapeghost. Use Book of Taiyou to get your tokens same turn. Left Arm helps search Taiyou, or another spell if you don't have Scapeghost in hand. Plenty of Allure of Darkness targets, ideally you're banishing Necroface.</p>
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Knightmare into Zeroboros with the tokens. If you used Scapeghost, you'll be left with one sheep token - use this to have Linkuriboh trigger Zeroboros' banish effect once your opponent has a full board without negates. Win next turn if you're lucky. Just remember Zeroboros' is NOT a quick effect - it resolves AFTER the current chain.</p>"

The deck is a bit expensive due to Dinosaurs being expensive, but this deck can play well even in a Maxx C infested meta, so long as you don't come across True King of all Calamities.

It plays much like it did in the TCG, but with the lack of Artifact Lancea running around as of submitting this, this deck is able to thrive and either stop your opponent from playing when couple'd with a Barrier statue on top of 2-3 disruptions, or can break your opponent's board in typical Dino fashion.

Tornado Dragon can be replaced easily with any rank 4 WIND xyz monster as a way to turn off Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds at will, it's just the one that works best in case of backrow decks."

Well you're in luck!

This deck is made up of only Normal and Rare trap cards and actually can put up a decent fight if you know when to activate cards.

Your main goal is to get some paleozoics on the field, Pacifics into the field zone to get some tokens on the board, phantasm spiral wave attached to a paleozoic or a token, and keep your opponent held down by the trap effects of each paleozoic, the hand effects of the phantasm trap cards, or lost wind as a card.

The extra deck can be something to go into if you have the proper cards on the field, like going into number 96/catshark and socuteboss and wipe the board or some cross-sheep combo, but your main combo will mostly wrap around your main deck. So good luck and have fun!"

","The Basic Idea is to rush out armed dragon thunder lvl10 as quickly as possible and keep it alive. So most of the cards in the deck are about either searching for armed dragon cards to start the combo chain, add more cards to your hand in order to utilize his effect, or protect armed dragon from destruction.

Outside of starting with thunder lv3 in your hand, you have a few ways to get the combo started.

Both Tempest and wind channeler will search for lv 3 at a discard cost to help you get started, but be warned that discarding a armed dragon thunder with channeler will NOT activate their graveyard effects as she's not a dragon. However, pairing it with tempest WILL activate their effects which means more searches on top of the search.

Armed Dragon flash will also make this work, as it SS's lvl 3 thunder from the deck. Thus helping you start the level up combo.

Artillery Catapult Turtle is also very useful. By tributing itself for its effect, you can rush out a thunder lvl 5, starting you in the combo from their instead of lvl 3.

&nbsp;

Armed Dragon Lightning is likely to be your prime protection tool, as its searchable with thunder lv7's effect and recyclable with thunderbolt. If you can draw it, the field spell will basically make your thunder lv 10 and white unbeatable while it is in play, as it negates targets and destroys on your lvl 10 monsters.

&nbsp;

Now the original Lv10 is here due to armed dragon blitz, as thunder's name becomes the same as the original, blitz can be used to SS the original lv10 at no cost. Which leads you to a top row nuke at the cost of a discard.

&nbsp;

If you cannot get into thunder lvl 10 for some reason, you have other options.
White is a great option as it can be SS'd if you managed to get decently far into the thunder combo but was stopped or if thunder is destroyed. Since it is paired with white veil, you get a backrow nuke and top row destroy on attack, and it negates any back row effects while it attacks which is great.
While tempest is here mostly to push along the armed dragon engine and even reset it if needed, it can be used as a reliable attacker in a bind , as you special summon it by banishing armed dragons, even from the grave.

Now I have not put my extra deck largely for master duel reasons. as the star of your show is your main deck, you dont NEED specific extra deck cards in your extra deck to make this deck work. The extra deck just needs to be filled to be used for pot of extravagance. However, if you want to build your extra deck specifically for this deck. rank 10 xyz monsters will be your best bet, as that will be on your field the most with thunder lvl 10, normal lvl 10, and white. i personally recommend looking at the superdreadnought cards for this, but as every one is UR in master duel, they can get quite expensive. other possibilities are rank 7 xyz monsters due to tempest, you could stop at thunder lv 7 to put one of those out, aside from that im not sure what situation you'd use any others aside from link monsters."

Alpha + zeta = dagda/scythe + F0 Utopic Draco Future + Apollousa / Draconids + Bethor
","<strong>Drytron Megalith Combo deck Febraury 2022</strong>

This deck focuses on re-inventing the alpha + zeta combo bringing out new strategies.

The Megalith component plays a huge role on the strat, with Phul actually recycling Benten from the grave and allowing rank 4 xyz plays.

This deck doesn't include Diviner of the Herald, which could be seen as an insane choice, but since we do not put our focus on synchro summons but powerful xyz instead Diviner isn't needed. We use Manju (searchable with Benten) instead of Diviner for our normal summon, that can add from the deck whatever is needed for the combo to continue (Manju is used most of the times to access your Megalith engine).

The rank 4 xyz (Manju + Ophiel) will often be tornado dragon to force the scythe lock or can be a Dweller (really impactful against certain decks).

The 2 Mu Beta are mandatory, we abuse both for the full combo.

The deck suffers from heavy backrow decks, I suggest playing Twin Twister, Feather, Cosmic and even Quadrantids in side deck.

<strong>Deck features (in my humble opinion)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Cost: 7/10, since we are not playing Diviner, the deck results less expensive (but still relies on the expensive card F0 Utopic Draco Future)</li>
 	<li>Consistency: 8/10, we are playing a lot of generic cards that can lead us to the main combo</li>
 	<li>Competitivity: 8/10, the deck can outplay and compete against a lot of decks in the meta. The full combo is still insanely strong.</li>
 	<li>Fun: 9/10, this deck, compared to the old herald version, is much more fun and lead to multiple options in terms of combos.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Full board</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1 Alpha + zeta = dagda/scythe (extra deck lock) + F0 Utopic Draco Future (monster negate + steal) + Apollousa  (3 monster negates)</li>
 	<li>2 Alpha + zeta = dagda/scythe (extra deck lock) + F0 Utopic Draco Future (monster negate + steal)+ Drytron Meteonis Draconids (huge untargetable beater, quick effect send 2 monsters to the gy)</li>
</ul>
Before going into Apollousa, it's possible to also go into Bethor (4+ card destroy, possibly a board wipe :D)

Another super cool combo is dagda + i:p, you lock the opponent's extra, summon scythe and then link for apollousa (or unicorn/phoenix/borrelsword if you want to play it)!

If you plan to propose this deck or get ideas from it I would appreciate the credits!

Thank you for reading, I'm open to every kind of suggestion to improve the deck and its strat. I personally think this is a great way to bring on our lovely Drytron deck!"

Presenting, Branded Beetroopers. Before anything else, I just wanna say that this is not particularly a competitive version of the list, if anything I doubt the two of these decks could ever work harmoniously together (but that's a problem for another day, or list), so this will be more of a deck analysis and discussion regarding my thoughts upon testing it rather than just a regular deck profile, so don't expect anything short especially if you don't find reading particularly enjoyable.

So the story behind this deck list is that an acquaintance of mine from Duelingbook sent me a message containing a link to a video of a Beetrooper gameplay (if you're here I appreciate the gift of thought), which shows a couple of lines that can set up to bring out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> during your opponent's turn with a card for negation in hand with the help of Fusion Parasite, which I assume also means that it also allows you to bring out any Invoked Fusion monster as well provided that you have the correct materials on board. The philosophy behind the merging however is that the Beetrooper portion of the deck can easily bring out Dragoon no problem, but so can the Branded engine, so why not splash the two of them together?

<strong>Chapter I: The Glaring Weaknesses.</strong>

<span>I play and test the Branded/Despia/Albaz strategy a LOT, since during the day it was released because one of my favorite Fusion Spells being the Fusion strategy enjoyer that I am is Super Polymerization, and Fallen of Albaz is just like a walking budget version of that, so I already have an idea on which cards to cut to make it as compact as possible without sacrificing consistency. But during the deck building process I have noticed that the Beetrooper portion of the deck requires a lot of main deck cards and one ofs in order to work ideally. Despite it only drawing soft bricks, you'd still want to draw the main starters. The main problem with this deck is that, the two engines clash with each other. The Branded portion of the deck xeno locks you into Fusion summoning only during that turn, else it cannot be activated, but the Beetroopers require Link summoning in order to start their turn, while the Beetrooper portion of the deck also xeno locks you into only summoning Insect monsters one way or another. I believe that there could've been a line somewhere that could make this relationship possible if one just wasn't as adamant as the other but, the only real way to somehow make it work is to force it. You gotta choose which one to pick as your main set up going first and your follow up going second. Ideally you'd want to start with the Branded portion of the deck first since it's the lesser restrictive of the two, but since we're playing a smaller package, it has to rely strongly on the luck of the draw.</span>

<strong>Chapter II: Sometimes coincidental synergies just ain't enough.</strong>

<span>Often times in your life you will find yourself on certain days stumbling upon things that you'll likely tell yourself that they could possibly fit together perfectly because of how much similarities they have. But things don't just match because of how much alike they are, it could also be because of how they're still able to find common ground despite how different they are to each other, but on the case of the latter, the risks of failing will be much higher. From what I've seen in testing pretty much just half of what the actual Beetroopers can do, I do admit that I am a beginner at piloting the deck since this day is literally the first day I have ever touched this archetype but I do also believe that this deck has a strong potential to grind. In testing, it even reminded me of the EARTH Machines, based on how much they Link climb, send to the GY, banish resources to extend, and recycle after setting up. And from what I already know about Branded Albaz is that it can DEFINITELY grind games without sacrificing board presence, that's why it's the best deck here in the OCG despite the plague of <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and the Adventurer Token. But apart from the glaring weaknesses of this relationship that I have already discussed, there's more. Branded Albaz needs as much coverage as they can get, and merging it with a strategy that needs their Extra Deck as well for starters means that I would have to sacrifice some of those coverage. Beetroopers also face the same problem, because despite having been able to recycle their resources for the next turn, it really doesn't have any much guaranteed follow up anyway. And with these two problems in mind, you'd have to choose a path: It's either the Beetroopers or the Branded Albaz, one has to be the smaller engine and the other should do the grinding.</span>

<strong>Chapter III: No man can serve two masters.</strong>

<span>We've already discussed their differences, and what makes their relationship tough, but we still haven't discussed what brought them together in the first place: <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. You see, this was a bit of an oversight on my part, I should've seen this problem coming. Sure, there are multiple ways of accessing it in this deck but the problem is, you've already got a tight enough Extra Deck space for one, what more for a more? So basically, both Beetroopers and Branded Albaz to an extent is clashing against each other again but this time on which one should bring <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> out. Branded Albaz can do it no problem with absolute ease, the only issue is that it's much more vulnerable to interruptions since it only plays a small amount of Branded cards in the main. Beetroopers can also do it somewhat decently, but a lot of things has to go right, and after that, it has already served its purpose.</span>

So yeah, that's pretty much everything that I have for the deck so far. I'm gonna be honest, I think these two are much better off without each other, considering how much they conflict and restrict one another from working as optimally as possible. It's sad but, maybe in another life where archetypes aren't as xeno locked as it is anymore they could work, but not in this one. Later."

GX era. First introduced were the Elemental HEROs and the Destiny HEROs, and the anime later introduced the Evil HEROs. Later on, the manga introduced the Masked and Vision HEROs. HEROs have been played differently over the years in many different decks. This deck combines the power of all of the HEROs together for a very powerful OTK strategy. The modern HERO deck is a non-linear combo deck, that aims to One-Turn-Kill(OTK) the opponent fairly consistently, but it can also set up a couple different powerful floodgates to slow down your opponent.</p><p>Your main starters of the deck are your Elemental HERO Stratos, Vision HERO Faris and your Vision HERO Vyon. In most cases, Stratos will search you Faris, which will allow you to get into your Vision HERO Combo. Vyon will be the last card summoned on your Vision HERO combo but sometimes it will need to be utilized as a starter to dump a HERO into the deck like Shadowmist to get a search to get more of your combo pieces, or Malicious to go into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader in a pinch to get your combo pieces.<br /><br />There are a couple different combo lines in the deck I will attempt to line out as best as possible.</p><p><br /><strong>Stratos + Any HERO</strong></p><hr /><p><br /><em>Stratos &gt; Search Faris &gt; Special Summon Faris &gt; Put Increase In Spell/Trap Zone &gt; Activate Increase Sending Faris To GY &gt; Summon Increase &gt; Summon Vyon &gt; Vyon Effect Send Malicious To GY &gt; Vyon Effect Banish A HERO Other Than Malicious to Add Polymerization.</em> <em>Summon Cross Crusader &gt; Cross Crusader Effect Revive Malicious &gt; Cross Crusader Effect #2 Send Malicious To GY And Search &gt; Add Liquid Soldier To Hand</em> <em>Activate Polymerization &gt; Use Stratos + Liquid Soldier To Make Elemental HERO Sunrise &gt; Liquid Soldier Effect to Draw 2 on Chain Link 1 and Sunrise Effect to Add Miracle Fusion From Deck To Hand on Chain Link 2<br /><br /><br /></em> This is a common series of combos for the deck that you'll be able to do fairly consistently to put a lot of powerful monsters on the field, what you end on will be up to you, with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, you can also use your Cross Crusader to add Destiny HERO - Denier to your hand and then use the Denier + Malicious to make Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer with the Polymerization There are other combos you can do depending on the different pieces you have in your hand.<br /><br /><strong>Fusion Destiny<br /></strong></p><hr /><p><strong><br /></strong><em>Activate Fusion Destiny &gt; Send Destiny HERO - Malicious + Destiny HERO </em><strong>- </strong><em>Denier &gt; Summon Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer.</em> <br />This line is very straight forward, it allows you to produce a Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on your field while having 3 summons set up in your GY through Malicious and Denier. <em>Fusion Destiny &gt; Send Shadowmist + Malicious To Summon Destiny HERO - Dangerous &gt; Shadowmist Effect &gt; Search Stratos &gt; Stratos Search Faris.<br /></em>Using Fusion Destiny to make Destiny HERO - Dangerous like this allows you to get a search and summon from Shadowmist and Malicious respectively. You can use this to go into your Vision HERO combo as well as the Malicious in the GY puts the effect of Xtra HERO Cross Crusader online. You have a lot of options for what you can search off Shadowmist but if you're trying to start a combo you're going to want to search either a Faris or a Stratos depending on what other cards are in your hand. From the point that you add the Faris you can proceed to go into your Vision HERO combo. Keep in mind however that Fusion destiny locks you into Dark attribute HEROs for the reamainder of the turn.<br /><br />I'll line out a use for the combo that allows you get still summon Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer even though you've used your Fusion Destiny. <em>Faris Effect Discarding a HERO For Cost&nbsp; &gt; Faris Summon &gt; Faris Effect &gt; Place Vision HERO Increase in your Spell/Trap Zone &gt; Increase Effect, Tribute Faris &gt; Summon Increase &gt; Increase Trigger Effect &gt; Summon Vision HERO Vyon &gt; Vision HERO Vyon Trigger Effect &gt; Send Destiny HERO - Denier From Deck to GY &gt; Vision HERO Vyon Ignition Effect &gt; Banish Elemental HERO Shadowmist &gt; Add Polymerization.<br /><br /></em> This line allows you to put the Denier in your GY to summon it with Malicious, allowing you to make Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer using either your Denier + Malicious or your Denier + Dangerous. Alternatively to this, you could just use Dangerous's effect to send your Destiny HERO - Denier and then summon Malicious from your deck to make Cross Crusader out of Dangerous + Malicious, but in either case you want to use the Vision HERO combo to add the Polymerization to fuse into your Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. The deck's optimum 1st turn board consists of summoning Destiny - HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law. These 2 cards together put a lot of pressure on the opponent because they are extremely powerful floodgates that will slow down their turn, or even outright stop their plays. Mask Change can be searched by Special Summoning Shadowmist, but keep in mind only 1 Shadowmist effect can activate per turn. Mask Change allows you to not only access your Dark Law, but it can also help the deck OTK, or even add a layer of protection for Stratos against targeting negation. You can use the Mask Change to help Stratos avoid being negated by effect negating cards that target such as Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. When you summon the Stratos and activate its effect to search, if your opponent activates either Infinite Impermanence or Effect Veiler to target your Stratos and negate it, you can use the Mask Change to turn Stratos into Masked HERO Blast, and because Stratos left the field to summon Masked HERO Blast, the Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence would lose their target and you'll still be able to get your search with Stratos.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p><br />I've opted to play Super Polymerization in this deck in order to hit a lot of the bigger monsters the opponent will have out this format, such as playing Elemental HERO The Shining as a target to hit cards such as Swordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao, Eldlich The Golden Lord or Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder. Elemental HERO Great Tornado allows you to hit cards such as Baronne de Fleur, Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen or Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds. Outside of being able to summon it with Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier, you can also summon Elemental HERO Absolute Zero with Super Polymerization to hit cards such as Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying or Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Elemental HERO Escuridao will mostly find use as being an extender summoned off the Miracle Fusion but with Super Polymerization you can use it to get rid of some cards like and opponent's Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. With a Destiny HERO monster you can Normal Summon, Super Poly also allows you to use your opponent's Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer to make your own Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, this is really powerful as because their Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer wasn't destroyed, it doesn't get its effect to special summon. There's still some things in this deck I haven't went over. You'll have to play around with it to really get the feel of the non-linear stuff. I hope the description helps you figure out this very familiar strategy.</p>"

This deck excels at shutting your opponent out of spell cards with Secrest Village of Spellcasters, Dragoon, Dark Paladin, and The Dark Magicians. It also stops your opponents from destroying your monsters with Dragon Knight and Dark Cavalry. It has strong removal with Spellbook of Fate, Hieratic of Prophecy, and Number 11: Big Eye, and Dragoon. It also has a ton of ways to search nearly any card in the deck."

The deck has a lot of power behind it that allows it to summon out monsters like Evolzar Dolkka and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, two really powerful monsters that can help secure you games. With the monster Miscellaneousaurus, you can add protection to your dinosaurs that will let you safely make your plays and go into your big boss monsters. Miscellaneousaurus can also be used on your opponent's turn to act as protection from their destruction effects or negations on their turn to ensure your monsters have more staying power. There are a couple of different combo lines in the deck I will go over <br /><br /><em>Summon Souleating Oviraptor &gt; Effect To Search &gt; Search Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus In The GY &gt; Summon Animadorned Archosaur &gt; Animadorned Archosaur Effect Destroy A Dinosaur &gt; Add Double Evolution Pill. Optimally, you want to destroy either Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon with the effect of Animadorned Archosaur so you can get an additional summon out of them. This is your primary Dinosaur combo line that can enable your plays into your Evolzar XYZ monsters, it can also allow you to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. You also have your Scrap combo lines. Your Scrap combos can let you go into the Synchro monsters in the Extra Deck by using Scrap Raptor as the tuner material. Your average Scrap combo will look like this. Summon Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor Effect Activate &gt; Destroy The Same Scrap Raptor &gt; Add Scrap Chimera From Deck &gt; Summon Scrap Chimera &gt; Revive Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor + Scrap Chimera To Make Scrap Wyvern &gt; Scrap Wyvern Revive Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Wyvern Effect Destroy Scrap Raptor &gt; Summon Scrap Raptor From Deck. </em></p><p>At this point the Scrap Wyvern's effect will resolve by destroying a card on the field. You have a couple options here depending on your established board. If you have a Babycerasaurus or a Petiteranodon you want to destroy those to get another dino on the field with their effect, if you control Lost World while your opponent has a token, you want to target the token for destruction, activate Lost World and then destroy either a Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon from your deck for an additional dino summon. If you have neither of those, you can either decide to just destroy a card your opponent controls or you can destroy your own Scrap Wyvern and use it to equip to Borreload Savage Dragon to provide yourself two negations, additionally, if you decide to play a generic Rank 4 XYZ monster in the Extra Deck, you can use this line to get you into those fairly easily if Scrap Raptor is your only combo piece.</p><p><em>Summon Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor Effect Activate Destroy Itself &gt; Add Scrap Chimera &gt; Summon Scrap Chimera &gt; Revive Scrap Raptor. At this point you have your two level 4 monsters you can turn into a Rank 4 XYZ. Keep in mind if you draw into the Scrap Chimera, you just want to use Scrap Raptor's effect to destroy itself on the field, and then this enables you to summon your Scrap Chimera from your hand, from that point you revive your Scrap Raptor from the Grave Yard. The field spell, Lost World puts a lot of the deck online. Here's a typical Lost World combo line Activate Lost World &gt; Summon Souleating Oviraptor &gt; Souleating Oviraptor Effect Add Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus In Hand &gt; Activate Souleating Oviraptor's Second Effect &gt; Target The Token For Destruction &gt; Activate Lost World &gt; Destroy A Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon From The Deck &gt; Summon Dinosaur. </em></p><p>Outside of this, Lost World offers you protection and acts as a mild floodgate, as its effect will make it so the opponent can only target tokens with card effects. You have a couple different ways of activating the destruction replacement effect of Lost World such as the Scrap combo listed above. There's some parts of the deck I haven't really gone over, and I might possibly update this to include more information. I hope this description of this deck was helpful to newer/returning players, or anyone generally interested in this deck.</p>"

Fire Hand is a 1600 ATK monster with an effect that allows you to destroy a face-up monster when its destroyed by your opponent's card, and then it lets you special summon an Ice Hand from the deck. Ice Hand's effect allows you to destroy a face-up Spell or Trap your opponent controls when it is destroyed by your opponent's card, and then it allows you to special summon a Fire Hand from the deck. The Hands in the deck allows the player to have a consistent way to break down the opponent's board, effectively punishing them for controlling a face-up monster on your turn. As neither of these effects have a once per turn restriction, you could use them over and over until you've wiped your opponent's field.

The next section is the Artifact lineup. The Artifacts are a series of monster cards that can be set in the Spell and Trap card zones, and they special summon themselves from the GraveYard when destroyed as well as apply an effect to give you additional advantage. In the case of HAT, the Artifacts that would be ran are Artifact Beagalltach, Artifact Moralltach, and the trap card, Artifact Sanctum. Artifact Beagalltach was used in the more combo oriented version of the deck, the control versions much like this one would just run the Moralltach and the Sanctums. Starting off with Artifact Moralltach, its effect allows you to summon it from your GraveYard when it is destroyed in your Spell and Trap card zone. If Moralltach was summoned on your opponent's turn, it allows you to destroy one face up card they control. Beagalltach's effect allows you to destroy a card in your Spell and Trap card zone when its summoned, this allows you to destroy your Moralltach and get it back as a monster to easily make the Rank 5 XYZ monster, Artifact Durendal. Artifact Sanctum's effect lets you summon an Artifact monster from your deck. Between the 3 copies of Artifact Sanctum, and the 3 copies of Artifact Moralltach, you are effectively playing 6 copies of Moralltach, which allowed the deck to maintain a lot of consistency.

Finally, the Traptrix. Traptrix are a series of cards that have different effects that revolve around the Hole trap cards, such as Trap Hole, Bottomless Trap Hole and so on. HAT would run 2 of the Traptrix, that being Traptrix Dionaea, and Traptrix Myrmeleo. Dionaea when normal summoned allows you to add a Hole trap card from your deck to your hand, but when it's special summoned, it allows you to destroy a Spell or Trap card your opponent controls. Myrmeleo when Normal Summoned allows you to Special Summon a Traptrix monster from the GraveYard in defense position, but when Myrmeleo is Special Summoned, it allows you to set a Hole trap card from your GraveYard, but it banishes it if it's still on the field during the end phase of your next turn. Traptrix monsters themselves are also unaffected by the effect of Hole trap cards, that makes them a pretty reliable Normal Summon, as they also have a decent amount of ATK points."

Today we have a deck focused around 'Fallen of Albaz'.

The deck is a bit clunky, and still needs some kinks hammered out, but the deck does function quite nicely in testing. The entire objective of the deck is to swarm the field with your 'Albaz' fusion monsters, and then swing for big numbers. Many of the cards in the deck do have negate power, and including 'Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon' just ups that amount.

The main cards to focus on in the deck are - Fallen of Albaz, Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous, Branded in White, and Branded Fusion.

The deck can be fixed up and tossed around by splashing a Chaos engine or Swordsouls into it."

Not too long ago, they got legacy support with more spell cards, trap cards, a field spell, and a new set of ""Mega Monarchs"": Level 8 Monarchs that can be tribute summoned using a tribute summoned monster to get an effect stronger than their predecessors.

Lets start with our Normal summons: 3 Edea the Heavenly Squire, 3 Eidos the Underworld Squire, and 2 Proof of Pruflas. Edea is a Level 1 monster that pulls another monster with 800 ATK and 1000 DEF from your deck. Eidos, is a Level 2 monster with 800 ATK/1000 DEF that allows you to immediately tribute summon a monster from hand when its summoned, doesn't matter if you normal or special summoned it. And then their Proof of Pruflas, a Level 3 special summon as long as you don't control a special summoned monster yourself. You can also immediately tribute summon a monster when its summoned, for an easy Monarch or Fiend!

Now our Tribute summons! These are the reason why we play the deck in the first place. We got 3 Erebus the Underworld Monarch, 3 Ehther the Heavenly Monarch, 1 Thestalos the Mega Monarch, 1 Kuraz the Light Monarch, and 2 Majesty's Fiend. Erebus and Ehther both send 2 Monarch Spell/Traps to activate their respective effects. Erebus sends any 1 card your opponent controls back into their deck. Can be from the field or GY. Ehther allows you to special summon a Monarch or Fiend from your deck, but you gotta return it to your hand in the end phase. Thestalos allows you to send a card from your opponent's hand to the GY, and you deal burn damage if the card sent was a monster and its based on its level. Kuraz pops up to any 2 cards on the field and then players draw 1 card for each card they control got popped by this effect. Note that Kuraz is one of the only Monarchs that can activate their effect on a special summon as well, but can't attack the turn its summoned. And then we got Majesty's Fiend, a Level 6 monster that can't be special summoned and prevents both players from activating their monsters' effects. It is without a doubt one of the best single tribute card you can throw in this deck. I previously had Vanity's Fiend in the deck, but Majesty's basically does the same thing.

Our spell and trap lineup now! These are what keeps the deck churning. We got 1 Foolish Burial, 1 Reinforcement of the Army, 1 One for One, 3 Tenacity of the Monarchs, 3 Pantheism of the Monarchs, 3 The Monarchs Stormforth, 3 Domain of the True Monarchs, 2 March of the Monarchs, 2 Return of the Monarchs, 1 Frost Blast of the Monarchs, and 2 The Prime Monarch. Foolish Burial, RotA, and One for One are obviously the generically good one-ofs that literally serve the purpose of either putting a Monarch or Monarch spell/trap into the GY for their GY effect or to Put Edei either on the field or into your hand, therefore starting your chain. Tenacity of the Monarchs is a Monarch spell/trap search as long as you have a Monarch in your hand to reveal. This card is a reason why we aren't running Terraforming for the field spell. Pantheism is a Pot of Greed as long as you have a Monarch spell/trap to discard and has a GY effect to reveal 3 Monarch spell/traps from your hand and your opponent selects one to add to your hand (Woo, another way to grab the field spell!) Monarchs Stormforth is a Quick-Play that allows you to tribute an opponent's monster for your Monarchs. Domain of the True Monarchs is our field spell and big payoff for playing the deck. It allows your Mega Monarchs (the Level 8 ones) to have their level lowered by 2, so they can be tribute summoned with a single monster! Anyways, the main effect we care about is if we are the only ones that control a tribute summoned monster and we don't have an extra deck, our opponent can't summon monsters from the extra deck. That is by far the strongest card in our deck that isn't Majesty's Fiend. March of the Monarchs prevents our tribute summoned monsters from being targeted and destroyed by card effects. Note that it doesn't mention Monarchs, it mentions tribute summoned monsters, so it gives protection to Majesty's as well! Return of the Monarchs is a search for a monster with 2400 ATK/1000 DEF or  2800 ATK/1000 DEF if you tribute summon a monster. Also note that Majesty's Fiend is 2400 ATK/1000 DEF so it can be searched with this card too! Frost Blast of the Monarchs is a pop for a set card on the field if we control any Monarch or Fiend, and has the GY effect to banish itself and another Monarch spell/trap to pop another set card. The Prime Monarch is a continuous trap that allows us to shuffle 2 Monarch spell/traps from the GY back into your deck and draw 1 card after. While its in the GY, you can banish another Monarch spell/trap to summon it as a Level 5 monster. More tribute fodder always helps the deck!

That's it for the deck honestly! You can put in any hand traps you might need or put in other Monarch spell/traps, like the one that allows you to tribute summon once during your opponent's turn. This deck is a little heavy on the SRs and URs, but it makes up for it by not needing to run an extra deck. Have fun not allowing your opponent to play turn 1!"

The game-plan is to essentially draw your whole deck on one turn and win with Exodia. For newer or returning players, I'll lay out the function of the Numeron Engine.

Your Numeron engine includes the cards Numeron Wall, Numeron Network, Numeron Calling, and your Number Gate monsters. You want to use Numeron Wall to activate Numeron Network directly from the deck. You use the Numeron Network effect to activate Numeron Calling, which will summon your 4 Number Gate monsters from the Extra Deck. At this point, if you have Memories of Hope in your hand, you can use it to Draw 4 cards. Either way, you will then use the Number Gate monsters to make Saryuja Skull Dread and activate its effect to draw 4 cards.

Called By The Grave is necessary as it gives you protection from cards like Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring or Droll &amp; Lock Bird which can stop your FTK Strategy."

Yes.

&nbsp;

You can search for ANY trap using Drytron. Why? That's because this is one of the few deck that can use <a data-name=""Beatrice"">Beatrice</a> AND <a data-name=""Auroradon"">Auroradon</a> in the same turn. The quick explanation is that Beatrice would send a trap to the GY and Auroradon would add it to your hand.

This strategy was way better when Imperial Order wasn't banned and Herald was alive, but it still is a respectable side among (usus) the many Drytron variants.

&nbsp;

This deck can also search for <a data-name=""Prisoner of Destiny"">Prisoner of Destiny</a> and use it in the opponent turn (with masquerena) to negate a key card.

You'll still Winning along the road though.,"Dinomorphia had Won almost every games against The Grinding Golden Lord, But in the New Format of Feb 2022, 3 Skill Drains are gonna be helping Eldlich for sure.

Inspired by a tournament top deck and to prepare for the new format, this is a quite competitive version of the Cyber Dinosaur Cosplayers and Robots Legion.

Some points:
<ul>
 	<li>Less NS, more Traps, more Responses to the opponent's actions. It's amazing that it actually works. Cause all we need is a Trap to start the game.</li>
 	<li>Gravedigger Trap Hole and Debunk are for things like Eldlich and Ash.</li>
 	<li>Ash was added for more interaction if having to go second first round and...</li>
 	<li>Ash tutors RexSturm into Psy End Punisher, is one of very few boss can get over Rex. So We addopted them.</li>
 	<li>3 Ferret Flame. These are our Speciality. That can Handle even Those Psy End Punisher- aliked bosses. It makes Player shuffle their monsters into the deck. therefore Effect-immuned Monsters can do nothing but making a good fly.</li>
 	<li>3 Brute. For Those who can attack directly, like the little Rank 1 birds. Also it's usually a plus 1 bringing back Theriza.</li>
 	<li>2 Torrential Tribute. to Clear field. good against combo decks like @Ignister or Virtual World. Because our monsters all float.</li>
 	<li>Imprudent Intrusion.  testing this one. kind of a flexible card, it can kill 1 or bring back 1. base on the different of LP. it can bring back the big ones too.</li>
 	<li>I feel safer knowing there are 2 Alert in the deck.</li>
 	<li>Same with 2 Sonic and 1 Reversion. Totally Helpful to Dodge an Attack to the LP.</li>
 	<li>In Side deck:  I think ablout Floowandereeze, Those Decks can apply Super Poly, and Of Course, Eldlich.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Yuto was still trashtalking a lot while losing his game last time we met. Poor him.

I think I should point this out. Yugioh isn't as noble as Chess, even in Chess there are Hustlers who trashtalking while playing but it's not cool. At all.

So Be Cool. Playing supposes to be Fun. Win or Lose.

<strong>And be aware of Cyber Bullying. and Bullying in genetal. Don't be the bad guy.</strong>

&nbsp;

Good Luck. Have Fun.
