Easy Emperor Wisel equipped with Dragon Buster or Winda, super consistent, great recursion, and ","Being quarantined makes Konami print good cards (loljk). Theres not much to explain in this combo as it's only a short one, and we have to work based on what's in our hand. Most of the times, we're trying to resolve Nucleus + Meklord Assembly for Emperor Wisel while having extender for Union Carrier (example, Obligato + Fortissimo field) or Winda via Dragma engine. The Dragma engine synergizes well with this deck, it contains Magicians Souls fodder while we can still recur it with Nadir from GY, great recursion and removal thanks to Shaddoll Ruq, Bastard, and N'tss. But while its combo is easy, <strong>we need to to pay attention to card interaction and restriction</strong>, making this deck prone to misplay and needs practice.  Pros: Easy setup with spell negation, summon prevention, big monster, and possible protection. Great recursion thanks to Ruq and the new Meklord trap. Good going  second with removal and/or big damage.  Cons: prone to misplay, main deck is super tight without handtrap/breaking board card (can be adjusted tho)."

Meluseek and kunquery provide situation disruption, while marionetter provides set up. This deck is trap heavy with disruption to monster effects, battle phase, and provides destruction or bouncing cards. It also runs super-poly just to be more annoying."

Dark World 2020 deck build  ,"I use TCG rules and current up to date Yu-Gi-Oh rules when making my decks in order for them to be up to date with other decks. This deck has many combos for multiple situations with tons of power and is extremely fast, it has a very powerful extra deck selection with readily available cards to summon them. I've updated my original deck due to learning more rulings and I feel it actually made it way better. I have been reading what everyone has been saying and suggesting and I've also been looking up alot of stuff and I'm constantly updating this deck. I've added a couple Galaxy-eyes for strong hitting and feild popping also Draglubion so I can bring out c107 or Harbinger super easy, i use sky prison and D/D/D all the time with Harbinger to lock people up. I've added some links since I've been seeing alot of OP links when dueling online and now I feel I have a good verity of stuff to easily counter alot of opponents in the new 2020 meta. I usually pick 2nd because that's what this deck is best going and most people actually pick first anyways to setup their board and this deck is great of popping boards. Feel free to leave a like &#x1f44d; and comment any suggestions or advice you might have, I love to see and read feedback from people thanks guys &#x1f601;"

Below are the reasons i run certain cards, The norm cards, i dont need to explain them like Rod, Dark Magic Circle and Eternal Soul.  Apprentice Illusion Magician is not as useful as it once was, however it still has its uses being a search for Dark Magician aswell as being a Honest for Dark Spellcasters. I also Run Kaijus because i prefer to be able to break down a players end board rather then stop single combos. If I wanted to run a second copy, id probably Drop Apprentice Illusion Magician.  Dark Magic Veil is a personal favorite of mine. it can extend your boar by summoning a Dark Spellcaster from either the GY or your hand!? All for the cost of 1000LP. For a more useful Monster reborn to either start, extend or recover your board, cant argue with that.  The Spellbook draw engine is used over other cards like Allure Of Darkness because i dont like the banishing requirements for allure. Aswell as Foolish Burial Goods, Upstart Goblin and Metalfoes Fusion for more deck thinning as well as draw power.  Along with Dark Magician Girl being included to utilize The Dark Magicians floating effect, Bond Between Teacher And Student is played for a added bit of spice and fun. However if you didnt wish to run them, you can always swap out for a 3rd copy of Super-Polymerization or other control cards.  Skill Drain in a Dark Magician Deck is a MUST! it has single handed won me a lot of games, so i cant recommend it enough.  Magicians Combination is one of those mar-mite cards, some like it, while others dont. I personally like it as it gives Dark Magicians a negate it needed. use it along side with Eternal Soul and even to protect Soul.  Beat Cop is another card used to protect your decks best and worst card. By tributing itself, (so even Skill Drain doesnt effect it) place a counter on Eternal Soul, now when ever it would be destroyed, you can remove the counter instead.  Hope you like the deck profile!"

This deck is doesn't OTK often but has a far better board after a few turns with 1 to 2 behemoths set and and 3 to ,"This deck is quite easy to use, here is what you do with each main card  Hidden city/Terraforming : (Search Hidden City), Activate Hidden City, Add Guru with effect (if already have Guru in hand add Fiendess (if already have Fiendess in hand add a Behemoth)), next Set Guru, Use Hidden City effect to flip guru to DEF, with guru add Fiendess (if already have Fiendess in hand either 1. Add another Fiendess 2. Add Final Battle (Better earlier game) 3. Add Cave Clash (Better later game)) If added spell or trap, activate or set it.  Fiendess : Fiendess can be discarded to negate an effect or activation (NOT a summon) of a card (Spell, Trap or Monster) while you have a face-up subterror during either players turn. It can also be Summoned to use its second effect to set 1 monster you control to Special Summon 1 Subterror from your GY or hand in either DEF position.  Guru : Guru's FLIP effect is to Search a Subterror CARD (Monster, Spell, or Trap) from your deck. He also has an effect to set another monster (on either field) and himself, this becomes a quick effect if you control another ""Subterror"" card (it must be a face-up card though but activating a Subterror trap then chaining Guru's effect does work).  Behemoths : When you use Guru's, Fiendess's 2nd effect, Final Battle, Hidden City, or another Behemoths effect to set a card you can Special Summon them from your hand (During either players turn) But you can't Summon them when Fiendess 1st effect sets a monster because it is a cost.  The Extra Deck : You don't have to use this combination of cards, you should just use your extra deck for banishing by the effect of Pot Of Extravagance, but it like this for that it can still be useful.  Handtraps and Solemn cards : These are pretty basic to use but here is a list of what is in here and what else you could use  Ash Blossom : If a card is moved from the deck to the GY, hand or Summoned to the field, you can discard this card to negate the activation, it can also negate effects that draw.  Ghost Belle : If card card is moved from the GY to the hand, deck, banished zone or Summoned to the field, you can discard this card to negate the activation.  Droll and Lock bird : If your opponent adds cards from their deck to their hand (drawing counts) EXCEPT during the Draw Phase you can discard this card to stop them from doing this for the rest of the turn (It does NOT stop them from adding the card you activate) Remember that this Also blocks YOU from doing the same for the rest of the turn.  Sauravis : If an effect TARGETS a monster a monster you control you can discard this card negate the activation, it also has the effect that while its in the GY, when your opponents Special Summon a monster(s) you can return this card to your hand to negate the summon and banished the would be Summoned monsters.  True King Lithosagym, the Disaster : This card can be summoned by by destroying 2 monster on your field and in your hand including a EARTH monster and if they were both EARTH monster you can banish 3 monsters from your opponents Extra Deck (you choose which monsters are banished), this can heavily disrupt your opponents plays."

Today, we will be taking a look at a deck that isn't as great, but has potential, what I mean, is Machina.  &nbsp;  The Machina archetype are a group of machines that love discarding themselves to summon big beaters onto the field, here is a deck list that does provide less budget options  &nbsp;  Budget Breaking options:  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li>Put Pot of Desires for Iron Draw, since Iron Draw isn't as consistent at all, having a requirement that isn't hard to achieve, but, come on, Pot is a LOT better than Iron Draw</li>  	<li>Scrap engine. Since we run Scrap Recycler, 1/3 of the Scrap engine, why not splash in the rest of the bunch? I didn't include Scrap Golem because it is over 5$ per copy, being at either $11-$18 right now. Scrap Wyvern would be good extra deck for this deck and is just here for the Scrap engine.</li>  	<li>Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion is a great extender and over all a great card you could include with this deck, since if you send it to the graveyard, it will give you a token, which is somewhat decent since Scapgoat got limited by just giving your four of those tokens.</li>  	<li>Jet Synchron is a decent budget card, not on the list for those cheap buy 3 and leave players in YU-GI-OH! Jet Synchron has the effect to special summon from the graveyard by sending one card in your hand to the graveyard, but its banished at the time it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber and any other kaiju (mainly Dogoran and Gameiciel perferably) would slip into this deck without a problem, maybe being your side deck since we have no side deck, go crazy with it!</li>  	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring with Twin Twisters and any other staple would make this deck have a decent competitive edge, since Ash is probably the best handtrap of the game's history and Twin Twisters for the backrow removal</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well I hoped you enjoyed this decklist, thanks for looking at it, and I will see you card players next time!"

Given the plush doll and horror themes of Fluffals, it's very obvious why I chose to name this deck after a movie from the <em>Chucky </em>franchise.  This deck actually functions like a normal Fluffal deck would--your strategy is to blindly go second and try to OTK your opponent. And because of Edge Imp Scythe and Frightfur Whale, Fluffals improve in both regards!  In my personal experience, I have never needed to use more than 1 Fluffal Dolphin. I'm not sure about other Fluffal players. But I also used 3 Fluffal Penguin because it's one of the best monsters to fuse with Edge Imp Scythe."

This deck is built primarily for going second, however as this can't always be guaranteed, some cards have been side decked which would maximise the deck's potential. </span>  &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  Cyber Dragons:  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> - Run at three for the benefit of <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>, which remains the deck's win condition. Seeing this in the opening hand when going second isn't an issue given it's effect, however it can brick if going first and you have no other cards to assist in bringing it out.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> - The deck's main starter and MVP, ran at three. When summoned, this will, if uninterrupted by your opponent, will add 1 ""Cyber"" spell/trap to your hand. This card's secondary effect (activated in the Graveyard) can also help reconstruct your board if your opponent has cleared your side of the field monsters, by bringing a Cyber Dragon monster from your deck to your hand at the cost of banishing Core from the Graveyard. Target #1 for Machine Duplication.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> - Again, ran at three as this is a Machine Duplication target. Both effects are useful, although you are far more likely to get mileage out of Herz mid-game when special summoned for Rank 5 XYZ plays. This card also synergises well with <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>, given Galaxy Soldier's special summoning condition of discarding a light monster, this card brings a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the hand to facilitate the special summon of the second Galaxy solider - instant XYZ summon into <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nachster"">Cyber Dragon Nachster</a> - Ran at two, as this is the only Machine Duplication target that can brick on turn 1; without another monster (preferably a Cyber Dragon) or Machine Duplication in hand, this is as good as useless. This card really shines when your Graveyard is filled with Machine monsters with the magical 2100 ATK or DEF value, however be wary that once activated you can no longer special summon non-Machine monsters for the remainder of the turn.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a> - Suprisingly useful link-fodder and a helpful chain-blocker for Cyber Dragon Core. I've heard of people running this at more than one for these reasons, however if this was the sole monster in my hand on Turn 1, I'd be very disappointed. Given that this is also <em>not</em> a Machine Duplication target, I would not advise having more than two in the deck.  Other monsters:  <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> - A Cyber Dragon in all but name. This is the go-to card to make <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> as it leaves your ordinary Cyber Dragons available for other uses. Synergises with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> very well and is searchable through Cyber Repair Plant. In addition, if you have already summoned <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> and these remain floating in your deck (a brick waiting to be drawn), these are ideal cards to discard to grant Rampage the additional attacks. Ran at two, as three increases the likelihood that multiples could be drawn and bricking on turn 1.  <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> - Ideal for removing a troublesome opposing monster (think Apollousa) and is easily removable thanks to <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>. Searchable through <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>. Ran at one, however this is a very good candidate to increase to two.  <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> - Easily accessible beatstick in the mid-late game, 3000 ATK is not to be sniffed at. The banishing summoning condition synergises with the deck very well and comes with a built in Monster Reborn-effect for additional link-fodder. As it is 8 stars, this also can be used as material for the XYZ summon of <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a>. This card can brick and therefore is ran at one. If you are not running Dingirsu, I would suggest replacing this with another copy of <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>.  Handtraps:  These are primarily a reflection of the current meta and can be adjusted accordingly without affecting the engine. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> - Ran at two, due to the 'once per turn' condition.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> - Can be increased to three, if you can find the space</li> </ul> <strong>Spells:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a> - The ROTA of the deck, with built in protection at the cost of a discard. Ran at three.  <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a> - An extender that relies on you having at least one ""Cyber Dragon"" in the GY. Searches the majority of the monsters in the Main Deck (excepting Levianeer and the Hand Traps), however is a hard once per turn and given the prerequisite, I wouldn't advise increasing to three copies.  <a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a> - Another useful extender; Monster Reborn for ""Cyber Dragon"" with the bonus option of allowing you to special summon a Cyber Dragon from the hand. Not particularly useful for your Extra Deck Monsters (barring <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>), however you have Nachster to bring them back from the GY. Could increase to two, however I prefer having a copy of Monster Reborn.  <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> - Your win condition. Target one ""Cyber Dragon"" with less than 500 ATK, special summons two Cyber Dragons from the deck. If this resolves, it's usually game over. Having this at three does make the deck very bricky, however given the risk/reward involved, the benefit outweighs the cost.  <a data-name=""Overload Fusion"">Overload Fusion</a> - Facilitates your OTK. Ran at two because although you want to see this card, having multiples in hand at the cost of an extender is not fun. The only target is <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>, however it's the only one you really need.  <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> - Quick play fusion card that also can facilitate an OTK, for the purpose of bringing out Cyber Twin Dragon or Rampage. In terms of using it, this is best activated during the battle phase, after all other monsters have attacked, bring out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> for 5600 points of damage.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - Staple for seeding the GY and activating Repair Plant.  <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - Useful as an extender and to bring back boss monsters in a pinch.  <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> - Consistency boost. A small boost, but one worth having.  <strong>Traps:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> - Great card. Maximum 4 cards popped on your opponent's side of the field and if destroyed by card-effect, you can search another ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your deck. Sided an additional copy for going first. Banishes Cyber Dragons to set up for Cyberload Fusion.  <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> - Wins you games!  <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - A particularly nasty way of clearing the opponent's board. It might stop you from OTKing on Turn 2, but it's definitely worth running at three!  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> - Useful to dispose of your Kaiju, and wiping the field clean in mirror matches or the occasional Orcust deck.  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> - Snatches opponent's monsters out of the Extra Monster Zone, what's not to love?  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> - Insanely powerful card. Has the potential to act as a Harpie's Feather Duster (depending on the number of monsters used for its Fusion Summon) and can attack three times. Ran at two as I'm running two Overload Fusions.  <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> - No matter how tempted you may be to cut this card from the Extra Deck, don't.

If you don't need another level 10 monster, and you've got Cyber Dragon on the field, use Flying Pegasus's effect, to make it a level 5, to go into Cyber Dragon Nova, then Infinity. I forgot to put in Machine Duplication, you can usually bring out Night Express Knight, so if you want to put in Machine Duplication, it wouldn't be a bad idea as a 2 of.  There wasn't really any space in the deck for Exodius, but it's also an option. If you're facing Eldlich, side in Neos Fusion and Rainbow Neos, though it does have some synergy with the whole Rank 10 thing.. Revolving Switchyard will often times decide if you lose or win, as it can de-brick your hand. Malefic Cyber End is a nice card, as you'll likely have a field spell on the field. It's also a Machine Level 10, which makes it pretty useful. JUST REMEMBER TO ONLY BRING IT OUT WITH A FIELD SPELL ON THE FIELD, even if your opponent has one, just don't make the same mistake I once did.  That's basically it. Good Luck, and make Anna proud."

I searched all web trying to find a good one for this deck, i didn't, so i made my own. I think that's the most consistent ""meta"" you can get.  <strong>Offerings to the Gods:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Almost any hand will open with one Nordic monster, you will almost always use him as material for Gullveig.</li>  	<li>Alviss is the best target for Gullveig effect, so if you have one in hand, don't use him as material for the link but as offering for the effect.</li>  	<li>Rescue Cat can summon 2 Nordic Beasts from your deck, if you don't have any in your opening hand. Summoner Monk is another alternative aswell.</li>  	<li>But what if i don't have it? Well you can easily abuse the tokens from Hippo Carnival. Simply chain Hippo Carnival to Gullveig effect and offer the tokens.</li>  	<li>Make sure to dump the right Tuners in your GY! If summoning Odin, you want at least one Nordic Ascendant Tuner so go for Vanadis, if summoning Thor you want a Nordic Beast Tuner, so go for Guldfaxe.</li> </ul> <strong>Immortal Deities:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Gullveig offers protection from target effects to any Aesir god, if pointing to one, she can't be targeted for attacks aswell as long as it points to that god.</li>  	<li>Mound of the Bound Creator will offer some extra protection if needed.</li>  	<li>If any god goes to the GY while you have Alviss there, you can banish him to Summon another one directly from your Extra Deck.</li>  	<li>And finally if <strong>destroyed</strong> by any opponent card and sent to the GY, each Aesir can come back during the EP by banishing the right Nordic Tuner.</li> </ul> <strong>Valhalla, Hall of the Gods:</strong> <ul>  	<li>The Extra Deck is very flexible, the only cards you really need are the Aesir Gods and Gullveig really.</li> </ul> Any suggestions just write down in the comments.

First and for most you want to get to Red Rising Dragon with a resonator tuner ASAP. from there you can go into the ""Big Dragons"" of the deck like: Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, Hot Red Dragon Abyss, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane, Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend, Red Nova Dragon, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, and of course Red Supernova Dragon.  A little spice I found through testing the deck is ""Supay Duskwalker"", Not only can it set up your graveyard with a resonator tuner but it can grant you access to a level 6 synchro or a big body for more of a higher level Synchro monster.  honestly I could go on and on how somethings go in the deck but I have a feeling its a lot more fun trying it for yourself.  &nbsp;"

Use the floodgates to counter things that you can't stop with the main deck Altergeists. Occasionally you will come across the matchup where you need your extra deck. In that case, sub out extravagance for demise and the 3rd duality so you won't risk losing key cards to negate things the main deck can't. Be careful with when you activate Imperial order because you might drain too many life points to use the solemn cards. Sub in Waking the Dragon to get Raidraptor on the field to deal with heavy backrow removal decks. Also, if you have a choice, always go first because traps are slow and you should quickly setup your board before your opponent can react.  My rating:  Attack: 3/5  Defense: 5/5  Consistency: 4/5  Strong against: HERO, Mystic Mine Burn/Exodia  Weak against: Harpies, Adamancipator  Negate combos:  Normal summon Meluseek  Link it into 1 of  the link 1s (Linkuriboh, Almiraj, Anima) Linkuriboh will negate an attack so is preferable, however if you need to get rid of a troublesome monster you can use Anima.  Activate Meluseek's GY effect, add Multifaker to the hand  If you activate a trap during your opponent's turn you can do this:  SS Multifaker with its effect (you can summon it even if you used a counter trap, see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Tips:Altergeist_Multifaker"">here</a>)  Activate Multifaker, summon Silquitous from the deck. if you would use Silquitous's effect bounce Multifaker  Now you have an attack negate (if you used linkuriboh), a card bounce and a Meluseek in the GY, which you can then use Manifestation or Marionetter to SS it.  &nbsp;  Set Spoofing facedown  Normal summon Marionetter  Activate its effect, set Manifestation  End your turn. The real part of the combo starts during your opponent's turn.  Activate Spoofing and shuffle Marionetter to get Multifaker to the hand.  Activate Multifaker's effect, summoning itself from the hand.  Activate Multifaker's second effect, summoning Silquitous from the deck.  Basically most end boards are going to be Multifaker and Silquitous in the monster zones and a manifestation/protocol to be activated.  &nbsp;  This deck is fun to play but very annoying to play against because of its disruptive ability to constantly negate your opponent's plays. I have played many online games with this deck and most of my opponents rage quit :P  Anyways stay safe and have fun!  &nbsp;"

It doesn't matter if you didn't equip a link monster for your Borreload Savage because you might not even need it.

Then, you proceed with your combo by Synchro Summoning using Riser, a level 1 tuner and Borreload Savage to make the mistake known as <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a>, which essentially locks your opponent out of playing Yu-Gi-Oh.  <strong>Plan B, if something goes wrong</strong>  Your goal should be putting up at least 3 negates on the field including a <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, a <a data-name=""D&lt;a data-name=&quot;/D/D Cursed King Siegfried&quot;&gt;/D/D Cursed King Siegfried&lt;/a&gt;"">D</a><a data-name=""/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">/D/D Cursed King Siegfried</a> and an <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>.  <strong>Plan C, if your dreams get crushed</strong>  <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>, <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, set random backrow and pray.  <strong>Yeah that's cool and all but how do I even get to that?</strong>  Basically 1 card. <a data-name=""D/D Swirl Slime"">D/D Swirl Slime</a>, the absolute star  of the show.

I don't think there's much more to it. One of the most powerful meta decks combined with a 1-card Utopic Zexal and the abilit,"Out of all the previous adaptations of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Zexal is regarded as having one of the strongest monsters ever to be in the game. Not only in the anime - but even monsters of that period themselves, for example: Zoodiac. However, nothing compares to sheer base strength of Don Thousand's ace monster, Number C1000: Pneumonia....sorry, Numeronia. Nobody would ever <em>dream</em> that Konami would release a monster with base stat of 10,000! And well, they haven't. Yet. But as of now we just got a few other gate thingys from the anime (and boy are they strong). The four Numeron gate cards all allow you to summon Number S0: Utopic Zexal: and with them all being summonable off of just one field spell - Xyz Summoning, has never been better. I present to you: Numeron Eldlich.  One of the best things about the Eldlich archetype as a whole is their ability to build up a board using a scarce amount of resources. With the Spells and Traps being able to switch between themselves, and Golden Lord using his effect to pitch them: you can still set up a competent board using the brickiest of hands, and have to enough to make a follow-up play the next turn. That's what makes this deck even better. This list allows you to end on your standard Eldlich board no problem. But what makes the new support cards worth it is the fact that - for almost 0 cost - you can lock your opponent out of activating effects for the rest of their turn. Having just the Utopic Zexal itself will give your opponent a hard time, but following that up with a pop from Conquistador and a Ash or Imperm will guarantee you victory. So now that the main strategy is out the way: here are some reasons behind why we play the cards we do.  The focus of the deck is turboing out your four gate monsters as fast as possible. In order to do that - we have to run three copies of Numeron Network. You always want to see the card, so I'd recommend playing Terraforming and Set Rotation too for the added consistency. Another great card that allows you to really unclog your hand is Memories of Hope. Since all the gate cards are number monsters, Numeron Network followed up by Memories is a free draw four. That's incredibly good! The only possible downside is the card tends to brick in certain situations when you don't open one of the five copies of Numeron Network - but even then you can just use it as fodder for Golden Lord. The deck has that much consistency. The final thing I'd like to mention are the more situational cards you play. Since you don't run Extravagance - there are a few extra deck cards you can play. The obvious ones being the Rank 10 Trains and the Rank 5 removal monsters - but you also can run one copy of Chaos Gate Sunya. This is mostly a backup play just in-case your opponent somehow gets rid of Zexal with something like Lithosagym - but this could also just be a cheese way of OTK'ing your opponent. Its effect, in a few words, does a guaranteed 5000 burn damage on your next standby phase. Provided your opponent has 3000+ attack on field - you could kill them with just this card. Like I said, you most likely wont go into this, but it's just a fun play nonetheless.  Overall: this deck drives forward with a strong 9.1/10. The fact that you can summon Utopic Zexal so freely and still make an Eldlich board is mind blowing. If we ever get these cards imported into the TCG - I hate to break it to you but Zexal will definitely be getting the ban treatment.  Its just too powerful of a card, especially paired with one of the strongest meta decks this format. One of the cards I never got to play test was definitely magicians' souls. I think that it could help unclog those bricky hands - but the only problem would be resolving your combo and getting it off the field. But since the ratios are perfect as they are and the deck already performs incredibly, I decided to leave it out. Apologies for my slightly long hiatus and the seemingly rushed deck discussion. I kinda lost the passion for deck building and focussed on studying and spending more time with family. To make it up to you though I'll be posting some spicy new lists for May 2020 that you could all try at home. Good luck playing yugioh as the new king of bling and don't forget to stay home. Happy Quarantine!"

(This could be Deskbot 001. The plus is that you'd go +1 in the hand off of it, the minus is that it's a total brick if you ever see it)</li>  	<li>Special Moulinglacia. Hand loop is at 3.</li>  	<li>Synchro Jet Synchron and Moulinglacia into Ravenous Crocodragon, drawing a card. You can use it to help break boards as well going second.</li>  	<li>Discard a card to special Jet Synchron, then link it and Needlefibre away in Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, summoning 3 tokens. Note that since we drew a card in the combo this is still hand neutral, and can be done off of 1 card.</li>  	<li>Tribute Auroradon and a token to summon Blue Impala</li>  	<li>Using Blue Impala and the tokens make Jaculuslan. This also makes Deep Sea Diva a 1 card 5 card hand loop. If you have 1 more water extender, you can tribute that instead of a token to hand loop your opponent for 4 at this point.</li>  	<li>Using your synchros, Xyz summon True King of all Calamities</li> </ol> You've now hand looped your opponent for 3-4, gained all the information you need, and set up a skill drain you can fire off in your opponent's standby phase. You can then use whatever other cards you have in your hand to extend into other plays. You can even link into Marincess Coral Anemone before making Auroradon in order to bring the hand loop up to 4/5 by summoning Needlefibre from your gy after the combo and banishing it for Desert Locusts.  This uses only 5-7 cards in the extra deck to pull off (5 for the combo, plus Borreload Savage and Herald for additional Auroradon combos), freeing a lot of room up for old more traditional mermail combos compared to Linkross, which take 7-10 cards in the extra deck to do the same thing. This means Diva alone can end on 4 negates with Apollousa and Toad, or on Borreload Savage + Herald of the Arc Light, or True King of All Calamities (all taking cards from your opponents hand), or on a 5 card hand loop with Mecha Phantom Beast Jaculuslan."

It's very difficult to brick with it and the tuto is efficient. Made this deck because I love Endymion since his first release.  <strong>Plan A :</strong>  If you have <em>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</em> in your hand, take a sit and it's winnable easily. Activate his effect in the pendulum zone to tuto <em>Mythical Beast Jackal King</em>. Activate his effect in pendulum zone and you got your <em>Cerberus </em>on the field. Try to activate magic card to feed him with counter and make him unkillable by using his effect.  <strong>Plan B :</strong>  <em>Mythical Bestiary, use it like a booby trap. </em> <strong>Plan C :</strong>  <em>Spell Power Mastery</em> is a good tuto that can provide you counter on each magical/pendulum monster.  <strong>Plan D :</strong>  <em>Endymion, The Mighty Master Of Magic </em>can be summoned very easily when you set your field with 6 counter (mythical beast monster gain 2 per 2 counters on them), plus, his effect is truly a killing joke (I will loose some friendship if I continu to play it), indeed, you can banish 6 cards on the field of your ennemy. ""Oh that's to bad""  <strong>Last but not least :</strong>  This deck can be played very easily, just seek what combo you want to do, is that pendulum summon with endymion's cards, is that tuto with mythical beast booby trap/mythical institution ? Or sacrifice your little magician to summon your beast from your hand ? <em>Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</em> is here to tuto some <em>Spellbook</em> or use the<em> Magical Dimension </em>card to summon what do you want from your hand.  <strong>Little tips :</strong>  If you were in a bad situation, don't forget your Xyz or <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em>, <em>Hey, Trunade! </em>can provide you free counters by sending all spell, and save you from traps, in the hand. <em>Spellbook of Secrets </em>give you counters and <em>Spellbook of Power</em>, this is the most free counter tricks I saw lol. Don't forget to clean your pendulum side when you want to use mythical beast pendulum effect. <strong>Never forget your</strong> <em>Magical Citadel of Endymion</em>//<em>Endymion's Lab</em>, it's not a MUST HAVE, but it can give you rest for your counter.  This is the first and only deck I really created by my own, I love how it works."

Luckily, Secret Slayers gave us another control archetype, Eldlich. Eldlich has proven to be an extremely powerful and consistent deck that has an incredible grind game, and best of all-- it doesn't use it's normal summon what this allows us to do is essentially play two decks with one opening hand. The basic idea is that you will start off with your Evil-Eye plays and then follow up with Eldlich ones. Best case scenarios you're ending with a typical Eldlich board with an extra pop or negate, worse case scenario you baited your opponents hand-traps to secure your Eldlich plays.  Pros: <ol>  	<li>The Eldlixer cards are chain-able, so you can chain them to the activation of Serziel's maintenance cost to avoid losing advantage.</li>  	<li>Since after Domain's activation you do not really care if it stays on field, in fact very often, you want it in the grave to recycle Evil Eye of Selene it can be used as cost for Eldlich The Golden Lord's graveyard effect.</li>  	<li>Both deck's have a very similar play-style that boils down to: ""Sit on a big monster with protection while putting up disruption for your opponent until you can pivot into your otk monster. "" The decks hardly ever step on each other's toes, as they want to do similar things most of the time.</li>  	<li> You get to play Eldlich.</li> </ol> Cons: <ol>  	<li>Though the addition of Eldlich means the deck is wildly consistent, when it does brick it bricks pretty hard, typically when drawing too many Evil Eye's of Selene (hence the playing it at 2)</li> </ol>"
