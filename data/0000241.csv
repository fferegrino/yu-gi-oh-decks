First and foremost the cards ""<a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>"" are normally available at 3 copies in the TCG, however Konami has taken the OCG's stance on these cards and limited them to 2 copies and 1 copy respectively. The hit to Magical Meltdown just makes seeing ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"" and thus the entire Invoked half of the deck more annoying and inconsistent, whereas the hit to ""<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>"" greatly reduces consistency on the Dogmatika half of the deck as well as the deck's ability to break your opponent's board due to not being able to send ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" and start your plays.  Secondly, you may have noticed the ""<a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>"" package aiming to summon ""<a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a>"". <strong>This is probably bad, full stop</strong>. HOWEVER, it is very funny and the actually good target ""<a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>"" is currently not in Master Duel. While Dystopia's 1600 burn damage and 3800 ATK after the effect of ""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"" do help assemble lethal both in and out of the battle phase, the reality is that this deck doesn't need it and would much prefer the recurring body of DPE. A more standard Shaddoll package of ""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a>"" and cards like ""<a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a>"" is assuredly better, but Dystopia is funnier and thats the hill I choose to die on.  Third, the extra deck here is not optimized by any means, there is a strong argument to cut two of the Invoked Fusion Monsters besides ""Invoked Mechaba"" or ""Invoked Purgatrio"" to fit in two more copies of ""Elder Entity N'tss"". I've opted for the two additional Invoked targets ""Invoked Caliga"" and ""Invoked Magellanica"" entirely to take advantage of ""Invocation's"" ability to use opponent's graveyard monsters as material for their summon. For example, you can banish an opponent's one copy of ""<a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a>"", their ""<a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>"", or even their ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye</a>"" so that if you're not able to end the game right then and their you won't have to deal with them the following turn. Magellanica is also has 3000 ATK for use with ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>"", though I like to think of this as a happy coincidence.  Next up, Hand Trap ratios. Master Duel is a super jank format best-of-one format with a banlist that looks like a pre-pandemic OCG list where someone just forgot about a few cards. Drytron, Adamancipator, Gem-Knight FTK*, Sky Striker, Thunder Dragon, Virtual World, Pendulum, Eldlich and <span><em><strong>so</strong></em></span> many more are better than we ever got to play them in the TCG and people are taking FULL advantage of it. As a result, I've opted for the hand traps you see before you, 3 pieces of main deck spell trap removal and 5 uniquely named hand traps, resulting in 13-16 pieces of generic interaction. The philosophy behind this is basically ""if my opponent opts to simply play through '<a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""'</a>, there has to be a punish for it eventually"", a lot of these decks are so cracked that you might need 2-3 pieces of interaction to even start contesting their board on either turn.  Lastly, some important things to note about weird interactions if you're new to the deck: <ul>  	<li>""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and 'Maxx ""C""' conflict, you can activate both on the same turn to stop your opponent from adding cards from their deck to hand, but you will not get the draws from Maxx C due to Droll being a symmetric effect.</li>  	<li>The effects of ""Nadir Servant"", ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"" and ""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"" to lock you out of the extra deck only apply if the effects to search actually resolve, they can be used to bait out interaction, though if you're going first or have already cracked their board they should be used as late as possible.</li>  	<li>The Dogmatika extra deck lock prevents summoning from the extra deck, ""<a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>"" prevents special summoning in general, you can't use both parts of the deck on the same turn.</li>  	<li>On a largely empty board Aleister &gt; Almiraj &gt; Secure Gardna &gt; Invocation for Purgatrio represents a 2300-3300+ ATK piercer that can attack every monster (even if its summoned during the battle phase) and the 1k from Secure Gardna. Dystopia adds 1600 burn alongside 3800 if you're able to avoid using the destruction effect.</li>  	<li>There are strong cases to be made for playing ""<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>"" over ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>"" over ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"". These would weaken your hands going first but greatly improve your ability to break strong boards if you're going second.</li> </ul> tl;dr: The Dystopia package is cope, so are the extra Invoked cards probably. Go second. Normal Summon Aleister."

Normal summon whatever monster (even hand trap), summon almiraj - gardna - sp summon maximus - send in gy apcalone and ash dragon - set schism for winda - sp summon ecclesia in EP by ash dragon and add fleur in your hand. I mention that combo because the most of the people thinks Maximus is brick or bad draw, but is not.  Small World is searcher for Aleister and Dogmatika, the deck is much stronger thanks to it."

(U.A),"<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">With the recent addition of Master Duel there has been a huge spike in popularity again with this fabled card game!</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">However for a lot of returning old school players or even those who have been out of the loop for a little while the game can be frustrating at times to play against the top meta decks.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Now if your anything like me you love a powerful feeling yet simple deck that is fun to play and doesnt feel like playing solitare and pulling off a 30 card combo that takes 30 minutes for just one turn.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">This is where our good friends the Ultra athletes come in!</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Now by any means this isnt a super competitive deck and it can brick sometimes (not very often now with the new supports) but often your opponent has never seen or played against this deck meaning you have an element of surprise and even a OTK chance.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">So who are the Ultra Athletes and what do they do?</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Well plain and simple UA works but ""substituting"" your cards during your main phases to give you an ""offensive and defensive"" team layout. You will typically play an offensive line to take out your opponents cards, backrow and LP then swap them out in MP2 for a defensive counter line for their turn.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">This is a lot of fun to pull off and keeps your opponent guessing at what you have up your sleeve plus with the amazing field spell and arguably the best equip spell in the game you can really surprise an unknowing player!</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The UA deck has a lot of 5* and above monsters (thankfully with the new support you now have more 4* options to get them out) so it can brick due to this but recently out of a good 70 odd duels ive hard bricked once.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">How does this substitution work? Well all UA monster cards have the effect: "" You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) by returning 1 ""UA."" monster you control to the hand, except ""UA. ....."". You can only Special Summon ""UA. ...."" once per turn this way."" this is effectively you swapping your offensive and defensive strats and playing to your opponents weaknesses!</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Lets get into the cards and how they are used in the deck i currently run:</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><em class=""_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE""><strong class=""_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU"">UA Midfielder 4* 1200 / 1000 :</strong></em></p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><em class=""_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE"">You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) by returning 1 ""UA."" monster you control to the hand, except ""UA.

This deck also mainly focuses on it's  archetype ""<strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong>"" aka. ""<strong>Rose</strong>"".  So how do I use this deck?  First of all you have to know that the main engine of this archetype is to <strong>destroy</strong> the whole field of cards via <strong>card effects</strong> (for example: Black Rose Dragon/Ruddy Rose Dragon). To deal damage to your opponent, you have to special summon monsters from your <strong>Extra Deck</strong> or <strong>Graveyard</strong> such as <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> to activate it's effects, which allows the user to target one of the opponent's monster and to <strong>change it's atk to 0</strong> ... basicially a mix between <strong>destruction</strong> and <strong>damage dealing</strong>. In this case, the player has to summon <strong>Synchro Monsters</strong> (either from the Graveyard {by the effects of Blue Rose Dragon or Basal Rose Shoot/Black Garden} or from the Extra Deck {via. synchro summon or the effects of monsters such as Ruddyrose Dragon/Crossrose Dragon}).  It does not sound easy, right? Well the thing is, that this deck is kinda<em> outdated</em>, especially with only one way of negating effects (Ruddy Rose Dragon). So instead of showing you a way to play a meta deck, I will show you the probably fastest and easiest way of <em>summoning</em> destructive and fearless <strong>Monsters</strong>  Monster Cards: In this deck we use a mix of main deck monsters and extra deck monsters (especially main deck monsters as tuning materials) <ul>  	<li>Rose Dragons: mainly used as fast <strong>synchro materials</strong> and to <strong>search out</strong> supportive spells and traps (feat. the ""Rose"" archetype)</li>  	<li>Plant Monsters: used as <strong>synchro</strong> or<strong> link materials</strong>, also used as cards to either search out other plant monsters or to <strong>special summon plant tokens</strong> on the field</li> </ul> Spell Cards: <ul>  	<li>Quick-Play Spell Cards: mainly used to <strong>special summon</strong> several <strong>Rose Dragons</strong> (either from the hand or graveyard) or to search out possible <strong>extra deck materials</strong></li>  	<li>Field Spell Cards: mainly used to either <strong>boost up</strong> your <strong>Rose Synchro Dragon</strong> or to special summon it by <strong>tributing plant monsters</strong> on the field (they are in generell plant tokens)</li> </ul> Trap Cards: <ul>  	<li>mainly used to <strong>summon out plant tokens</strong> or to<strong> protect</strong> or your monsters <strong>by banishing them temporarily</strong></li> </ul> I hope that little description did help you to understand the function of this deck.

As someone remembers, I tried yesterday to focus this deck on defending <strong>Number 88</strong> and winning with its effect, but I couldn't really find a good way to summon always him in the beginning of a duel; I'm not saying that it's a bad card, but it's just not so easy to summon in the first turns (and that's why I put him in the <strong>Side Deck</strong>).  So I decided to give more space to the other Gimmick Puppet numbers, such as <strong>c15</strong> and <strong>c40</strong>, because they can help you out to get rid of most of the opponent's card in the field. And to help them out some defenses are required:  -""<strong>Condolence Puppet</strong>"" grants to c15 and c40 to survive against cards as <em>Raigeki</em> (which is kind of popular in Master Duel);  -""<strong>Heavy Metal Raiders</strong>"" (the Field Spell) can keep in battle every g. puppet monster that you have in the field, which is kind of dope (idk why no one talked about this card already but whatever);  -""<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>"" and ""<strong>Broken Line</strong>"" can block most of the combos (I used those against a <em>Blue Eyes</em> deck and I was laughing my ass off);  -""<strong>Debunk</strong>"" can negate <em>Ash Blossom</em>'s effect, and that's cool;  -""<strong>Network Trap Hole</strong>"" can also block <em>Summon Combos</em>, especially the ones that use the <em>main deck</em> or the <em>GY</em>;  - ""<strong>Mythical Space Typhoon</strong>"" I think it's almost needed in every deck, can destroy a lot of annoying cards (especially <em>Field</em> ones);  -""<strong>Number 23</strong>"" and ""<strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong>"" are the best boys in this deck, they can negate effects and prevent the destruction of your cards by opponent card's effects.  I also kept ""<strong>Barrier Statue of the Abyss</strong>"" in this deck, because I find interesting his effect; I honestly discovered his existence some days ago, and for now I couldn't find a duel where this card saved me from enemy combos, so if this card keeps being useless, I'll decide to remove it from this deck, and maybe replace it with an another monster.  And as Rank-Up card, I think that ""<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force</strong>"" is the best choice among the others, because you can negate <em>all face-up card's effects</em> permanently, which is kind of sick, but at the same time this card could be your doom if you use it incorrectly, so think carefully when you should use it.  With those things said, I'll continue my research on creating the ultimate Gimmick Puppet Meta deck, and if I succed in my goal, I'll put this deck in the ""Meta"" category.  If you suggest some other cards to put in this deck, or if you think that some of those cards are useless, please write your opinion in the comments, so that we could bring gimmick puppets in the meta togheter.

The rest of the deck is just removal, negation, churning through the deck, and getting powerful fusion summons, including Last Warrior From Another Planet, who prevents summons. Book of Taiyou isn't considered a flip summon, so this allows you to set cards and flip them into attack position even under his effect.  9th deck made in a progression series after drawing 48 of every set before Invasion of Chaos, but using post-errata cards and the February 2004 ban list."

Anyway, If u replace windwich engine with Enforcer package  also is ok if u have the budget. Both engines are killer. Personally i like the windwich engine because is not expensive and is working very well with both invoked or dogmatika engines.  About Maximus: Everyone using 1 copy of maximus (me also in the past) but that's wrong, Maximus x3 is the best. Normal summon whatever monster (even hand trap), summon almiraj - gardna - sp summon maximus - send in gy apcalone and ash dragon - set schism for winda - sp summon ecclesia in EP by ash dragon and add fleur in your hand. I mention that combo because the most of the people thinks Maximus is brick or bad draw, but is not.  About Windwich engine: Sp summon Windwich ice bell and use eff - sp summon glass bell and use eff - add snow bell and sp summon it from hand - summon wind pegasus using glass bell and ice bell - summon crystal wing using pegasus and snow bell. The same turn u can normal summon Aleister for Raidjin or normal summon ecclesia (search by nadir) to add fleur in hand. Note: if u have both Maximus and Ice Bell in hand then u have to choice between Maximus combo or windwich combo, if your choice is for Maximus then normal summon Ice Bell (or other monster) and summon Almiraj - Gardna - etc...

I normally wouldn't suggest this deck to anyone at all, including Sky Strikers not because they're bad, but for various reasons I do not wish to state, especially if you already have a deck in mind in which you are confident enough that you can actually pilot competently enough, but the only reason as to why I do is simply because of how easy it is to obtain and pilot, and how it interacts with the low rarity staples in the game. Also, Eldlich is technically a Fusion strategy, except we don't really have the <a data-name=""Seven Cities of the Golden Land"">Seven Cities of the Golden Land</a> to fuse yet (correction, we do already have it, it's just that <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Mad Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Mad Golden Lord</a> is another UR that you'd have to pull/craft, so unless you're dedicated to Eldlich, I don't recommend building using it), but anyway.  I made this list as free to play as possible, and with the assumption that you've already done the basic free to play routine at this point in the game.  <strong>Addressing the deck list:</strong>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> = <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, alongside <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, are probably two of the most easily obtainable and most powerful staples in the game, hands down. You can easily unlock it buy either crafting a random UR/SR ""Forbidden"" or ""Darklord"" card to unlock the ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Pack, where you can farm it there by unlocking packs and get crafting materials. What this also allows you to do is to pivot into the Darklord strategy, if that interests you in any way, shape, or form, or just as an investment for future support/archetype releases that might have synergy with it, such as Despia.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> = Pretty self-explanatory. You can easily unlock <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> by either crafting a random UR/SR ""Parshath"" or ""Agent"" card to unlock the ""Guardians of the Sacred Sky"" Secret Pack, where you can farm it there by unlocking packs and get crafting materials. What this also allows you to do is to pivot into the Counter Fairies strategy, a classic control deck that focuses mainly on the small Fairy-type monsters that gain effects upon activating a Counter Trap, which also has great synergy with Eldlich. I have also made a list for that if it interests you in this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/counter-fairy-eldlich-master-duel/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/counter-fairy-eldlich-master-duel/</a></span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> = These two, you can actually decide to play together if you want, in any ratio you see fit.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> = I'm actually on the fence between these two, because they both have their own strengths and weaknesses. The former being not minding getting discarded for <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, and the latter essentially being used to either lock down a column from Spells or as a defensive tool going second. I'll leave this one up to your personal preference.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">Number 61: Volcasaurus</a> into x1 <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> = Good enough boss monster with a non-destruction quick play interruption, while the former is a monster spot removal but worse.</span>  <strong>More budget options:</strong>  <span>• <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> (SR) - This is considered a budget option due to a play set of this being guaranteed to be available in the ""Magician of Pendulum"" Structure Deck. Buy with caution.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a>/<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> (R) - Both monster interruptions that stay on the field. </span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dark Core"">Dark Core</a> (R) - Outs monsters that cannot be destroyed by card effects but can still be targeted. Also a discard enabler.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> (R) - Great against swarm and Pendulum decks, or just non-Link boss monsters that are pretty difficult to out.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dust Tornado"">Dust Tornado</a> (R) - Back row removal and potential set up.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> (R) - Generic spot removal and discard enabler.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a> (R) - Generic spot removal and enables Lightning Storm if you decide to play it.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Magic Jammer"">Magic Jammer</a>/<a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a>/<a data-name=""Divine Wrath"">Divine Wrath</a> (R) - Generic Counter Traps that are also discard enablers.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Light-Imprisoning Mirror"">Light-Imprisoning Mirror</a>/<a data-name=""Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror"">Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror</a> (R) - Attribute related floodgates.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Trap Jammer"">Trap Jammer</a> (N) - Also a generic Counter Trap, could be nice on mirror matches.</span>  The extra deck is pretty self-explanatory being filled with either <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> targets or <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity </a>fodders. Make use of <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>, <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, and <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> as soon as you get hold of them. <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> can also be a cute tech, in case you run into <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> mirror matches. That's pretty much everything there is to it."

Trap cards can counter most of the combos, if positioned correctly. Barrier Statue can also stop most of the combos from meta decks with types different from the Dark one. Gigantes doll can steal 2 of the opponent's monsters, and you can use those monsters as xyz materials for n. 88. I also added others rank 8 dark monsters to defend number 88 from effects.

Just xyz summon Gustav Max and use its effect and then rank it up into Juggernaut Libre and attack twice. This is one of the strongest decks in the meta right now and has some amazing matchups.  You can use Skull Mieter instead of DD crow if you would like since they are both dark attribute and can therefore be used to bring out Winda. You can also replace one of the N'tss for an I:P if you would like. You can run Construct instead of Winda but I wouldn't recommend it because Winda is a strong floodgate that fits well in this deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

They can get out link and xyz monsters really quickly and can gain advantage off of it. The Inzektors have this fun gimmick where they can attach other Inzektor monsters to themself and gain strong effects off of it when they are on the field and sent to the graveyard. This works perfectly in a deck that loves to bring out link monsters which this deck does.  I added the Red eyes Dark Dragoon because the card is absolutely bs and can be brought out on turn 1 rather consistently thanks to Predeplant Verte Anaconda.

Not Only that but this deck does run Monk of the Tenyi and Mystery Shell Dragon which combo with the tenyi monster effects from field and graveyard.</li>  	<li>Mystery Shell dragon is a Normal Monster with a solid 2000 attack which can be used for the virus cards and it's also a Wyrm type monster which can be used to summon Shaman of the Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Mask of Darkness was originally a joke since yknow we wear mask during the Pandemic to face off a virus.... but it's effect cycles trap cards which is good for a Trap deck like this.</li>  	<li>Tribe-Infecting Virus, I was originally going to run 3 of these but I only have 1 in the collection lol and 6$ for one is pretty expensive. You could interchange mask of darkness for the other two if you choose too. ( Listen only because you can afford hefty cards and 6$ isn't a lot doesn't mean we lower class don't exist)</li>  	<li>Dust Kaiju is just an overall good card since it tributes one of your opponents monsters so you could get rid of some annoying cards. Plus this can combo with Lair of Darkness and a virus card if you were to summon a kaiju on your opponent field you could use a virus to tribute the same kaiju since lair of darkness allows you to tribute opponent monsters.</li>  	<li>Lilith is a trap card search so you basically guarantee a virus in the hand as long as you have her on the field.</li>  	<li>Eldlich is just a great card since he can summon himself after a long process, not necessarily great but he could some in clutch with the attack stats.</li>  	<li>Recurring Nightmare cycles lilith, mystery shell, and Ahrima which is always great since they all have they're purposes.</li>  	<li>Allure of Darkeness is +1 and this deck is full of dark type monsters so it shouldn't be a big problem.</li>  	<li>The Fang of Critais summons doom virus dragon which has a crush card virus type of effect which is good plus if you so happen too you can use it as material for a virus card.</li>  	<li>I shouldn't have to explain Lair of Darkness this deep in.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone is one of the few spell and trap negates in the deck which is why I chose the banish effect over MST or Twin Twisters.</li>  	<li>All the virus cards are what run the deck which is why the monsters either have strong attack or strong defense, The weaker virus cards though have more copies since I feel those cards are more accessible in requirements compared to the stronger virus cards like grinning grave and eradicator virus</li>  	<li>Aight so Originally the deck ran Imperial Order, Got absolutely yeeted into the ban list soooo changed it to solemn strike for monster negate but like always you can switch this out for another cosmic cyclone.</li>  	<li>Monk of Tenyi is a Normal Monster to combo with the tenyi, Shaman is a good monster card especially the effect is has with the other wyrm and tenyi monsters which is why she's in here. Berserker legit cause why not lol.</li> </ul> Overall that's it if you made this far, Thank you for taking your time. Made this deck because we are in a pandemic and got inspired to make a virus deck. I know the deck is a joke but the real virus isn't please everyone be safe out there and please wear a mask. If you haven't gotten vaccinated please do, I can't force you to so if you don't want too that's up to you.  -Kish"

Plays well through interruptions and has an excellent grind game.,"Crystal Beasts, Tri-Brigades, and Albaz have a myriad of synergies with each other that this deck aims to exploit.  The Crystal Beast engine adds level 4 Beasts to the field and beasts/dragons to the hand, generating a ton of card advantage but lacking a clear way to exploit that advantage.  Tri-Brigades use those beasts on field to advance their plays and use the extra cards added to hand from Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon to pay costs of cards like Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm, Tri-Brigade Ferrijit, and Tri-Brigade Kerass. These are the monsters that create the big plays and provide much of the grind game.  Tri-Brigade Mercourier, when banished, can add one of several cards from your deck to hand. Most often, you will often grab Albion the Shrouded, whose effect sends Branded Blade from Deck to grave in order to draw and add Mercourier back to hand. When in hand, it functions as a monster negate when you have an Albaz on the field  Branded in High Spirit converts a beast/dragon in hand into any of your albaz-related monsters - most often you'll grab Springans Kitt which can then special summon itself and grab Branded in Red or Branded Condemnation. It will send either Brigand or Albion the Branded Dragon from extra deck to grave, which will supply you an additional interruption or follow-up.  Allure of Darkness either converts the Rainbow Dark Dragon into tangible advantage or triggers Tri-Brigade Mercourier (providing a +2 when used to add Albion the Shrouded)  Your typical going first play is to land on Verte + Bearbrumm on field with mercourier in hand, then use Verte to send Branded Fusion to grave, fusing Albaz from deck with the Bearbrumm on field into Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon.  Then Bearbrumm will add Revolt to your hand. If you opened branded in high spirits, this can be further backed up with Branded in Red (for Guardian Chimera) and/or Branded Condemnation, leaving you with a board of 5-6 interruptions all coming from different places and a ton of cards added to your hand on the opponent's turn for turn 3 to guarantee you win the duel."

Salamangreats offer easy Link plays, easy GY recovery and search tools. You can board wi","Your main strategy is to start with Foxy (for +1), Link summon Balelynx (Link 1) and grab Sanctuary (for +1 and protection),  and/or use special summon bodies like Jack Jaguar and Spinny to advance to Sunlight Wolf (Link 2) and special summon another body to his link (for +1), then advance into Heatleo (Link 3) for non-destruction Spell/Trap removal or Pyro Phoenix (Link 4) and activate Sanctuary to summon him on top of itself to full wipe your opponent's board.  After you finish your Link plays you should end up with at least 1 Balelynx and a few Salamangreats in your GY. After this point you can set your counters (Roar, Solemn Judgment and Infinite Impermanence) and prepare yourself for the coming turn. Roar is basically a budget Solemn Judgment that has no cost and only requires you to have 1 Salamangreat Link monster (which you can always have, even Balelynx works) and you can recover it afterwards when you Link summon on top of the same monster with Sanctuary's effect. Make sure you start your plays with Foxy to benefit from pure +1 and use your Circle to pick whatever Salamangreat you are currently missing in your hand. More names = more summons, because each Salamangreat effect monster has a hard once per turn tied to its special summon.  Salamangreats are very versatile and offer easy recovery from GY. Only problem they have is non-target removal and that's why it is a budget deck. Decode Talker, Transcode Talker, Rasterliger and Flame Administrator are simply to offer ATK boost incase you run into a destruction immune boss monster. Firewall Dragon is cumbersome to summon but if you have Will Of The Salamangreat and Sanctuary on the field, you can summon Sunlight Wolf on top of itself to revive the second copy from GY and go into Firewall Dragon easily. It offers non-destruction removal in case you need it."

An awesome day, a very good day indeed. Sky Striker are rockting in the new and most anticipated MASTER DUEL,So this an all time favorite list that I had the pleasure to build, and everything for free. Do you wanna see?</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Disclaimers</i></b>  <span>     This game follows an aumagnation of banlist (OCG + TCG), so a lot( and I Say really a lot) are different from the usual cards that you are familiar with. So expect cards like MAX “C” and other abomination.</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Starters</i></b>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Raye</b><span>: This cute girl or your main starter. She can bring almost every   sky striker monster in your extra deck and makes a good protection for your Links sky striker monsters against destruction, 'cause Raye can bring herself from the GY and link again in another sky striker. </span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x</b> <span>Sky Striker Ace - Roze</span><b> :</b><span> The fearsome antagonist of Raye,  Roze can be another great starter for the sky striker link play. The effect that she can be summoned with another sky striker is good, but the effect that she returns to the field when an opponent's monster is removed from the extra monster zone is beyond insane, additionally can also negate the effect of another opponent's monster. This card is insane. </span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</b><b>: </b><span> another way to summon the links monster. Furthermore it can be used for other combos utilizing link-2 monsters like  </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Zeke</b><b>. </b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Reinforcement of the army</b><b> : </b><span>search Raye of Roze depending on your needs.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>2x </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b> <b>:</b><span> Guess who is at 2? Sky F@#$ing striker Moblize engage! This card is a pot of greed on legs, searching for sky striker cards and with the right set up, makes 1+ in card advantage by drawing another card from the deck. The cherry in the cake is that it is not once per turn, so you can recycle with </span><b>Striker Ace - Kagari</b><b>. This card was banned for a reason and I’m happy to see its back.</b>  <b> </b>  <b>1x Chicken Game:  </b><span>Man.. I love this card , it is so risky yet so  satisfying to use to draw 3 or 4 cards,  almost a prosperity. I wish I could play it on tcg.</span>  &nbsp;  <b><i>Pseudo Starters</i></b>  <span>  They’re considered starter only if certain conditions are fulfilled (combination with other specific cards, luck in a draw, etc.)</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><b> + 2x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</b><b>: </b><span> Area zero can dig more in your deck while finding a copy of the sky striker monster or a sky striker spell. In other cases, you can use  Multirole to pop Area zero and get a free summon of Roze or Raye.</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Extenders</i></b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><b>: </b><span> You can search some cards by dig 3 card in your deck, but you have to pop one of  your cards. You can use this effect  like explained above  or  to pop any monster of your opponent  in combination with  </span><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</b><b>.</b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Terraforming</b><b>: </b><span> Search  </span><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><span> to help in your plays, additionally you can search </span><b>Chicken Game </b><span>.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Upstart Goblin</b><b>: </b><span> Draw a card, nothing to explain.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</b><b>: </b><span>This card shines with your second effect to use every Sky Striker spell … all over again. Insane and deserve to be limited. Also, make any sky striker magic cards irresponsible by any effect of your opponent. This card, at least for me, worked  better at 2 instead of 3. Maybe in the future I’ll cut to 1.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</b><b>: </b><span>She is amazing and  the perfect monster to stall your opponent with Mystic mine if you decide to side it. She can also send a sky striker spell to late recovery with </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</b><span>.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</b><b>: </b><span>The effect of adding to your hand any sky striker spell is outrageous. Cycle spell, recover spell that was negated, search cards in conjunction with </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</b><span>… this card does so much for one card that deserves the time that was limited. Now you can even recycle </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b><b>... what a time to be alive.</b>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</b><b>: </b><span>This is your primally way to get the spell  like </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b><span> And every thing that you wanted, too bad it only in you final phase, but She can be a fine protection by lowering the opponent's monster attack by 100 for each spell card in the GY.</span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Controller/Defenders</i></b>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Infinite Impermanence + 2 x effect Veiler</b><b> :</b><span> Handtraps are always welcome to control any kind of play ( or plan) that your opponent may have. Additionally </span><b>Infinite impermanence  can be set.</b>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</b><b>+ 3x </b><b>MAX “C”</b><b>:</b><span> your primaries hand trap to stop your opponent from playing., ash to be herself, annoying as a spoiled brat. Max”C” in other hand is the most annoying insect that may have existed on the face of earth. Man what broken card, thank God this is not o Tcg,. May rest in peace Combo deck. </span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>There Can Be Only One</b><b>: </b><span>Decks based on one type card (Salamagreat or dragon link  for example) suffers a lot with this majestic stall card.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</b><b>: </b><span>one of the most broken cards in this archetype, that spell can steal a monster in the opponent’s field to use for attack, link folder or furthermore can negate an effect of a monster if you wish, becoming one of the most versatile cards in your deck. I’ll miss the second one</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Shark Cannon</b><b>: </b><span>Your </span><b>D .D . Crow</b><span> in spell form, can distrusted some plays of your opponent, and also can special summon one of this opponent's monsters  in your side of the field to generate advantage (</span><b>Masked HERO Dark Law</b><span> For example) or to be a  link folder.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Zeke</b><b> + 1x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kaina</b><b>:</b><span> Both have a similar role that can be exploited in the opponent’s turn. Kaina can be summoned by the effect of Raye in the opponent’s turn and not allowing a monster to attack. Zeke on the other hand, can be used with Roze and Raye to banish a monster in your summon.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x Mind Control:  </b><span>Communism in the form of a card. Is our monster now.</span>  <b><i>Utility cards</i></b>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Lightning Storm  2x Raigeki+</b><b>: </b><span>You know the deal</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves!</b><b>+ 1X </b><b>Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!</b><b>: </b><span> Pop a monster and a set spell/trap card , respectively</span>  <b>OTK package:  </b><span>You know the drill. halq+ Effect veiler= Selene, Selene+veiler= Access codetalker.

This is the deck that I've used to grind in Master Duel, Tenyi ft. <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>, <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a>. It's absolutely cheap, you only really need two in-archetype UR cards and 3 in-archetype SR cards, and the entire Tenyi core in the main deck is literally made up of Rares and Commons. This deck has only one goal in mind, and that is to set up <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a> as soon as you can and summon either <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> going 1st or <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> as soon as you can.</span>  <strong>A few questions you might have:</strong>  <span>• ""Why <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> instead of <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a>?"" - Because the former only requires you to tribute one monster for its Tribute Summon, and that actually matters because it allows you to have enough monsters for a Synchro Summon of a defensive monster like <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> alongside your <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a>, which is actually a better option than <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> since <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> prevents you from activating the effects of non-""Tenyi"" monsters that are Special Summoned from the Extra Deck upon using its effect to Special Summon a Wyrm monster from the GY (most likely a Mare Mare).</span>  <span>• ""<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> on the main?"" - Yes, there are no side decks (as of now) in Master Duel. These slots could be for any high impact/consistency staples, really, and that includes your hand traps if you're the type of guy who prefers <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> over anything. If you don't have any defensive hand traps yet, you can add more <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a>, <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a> in a ratio of your liking.</span>  I wanna keep it short and sweet since it's a pretty straightforward deck to play, and there's really nothing much else to say about it. Have fun."

There are many routes to the boss monster; however, the most practical sequence is <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (search out Ignister AILand) &gt;&gt; <strong>Cyberse Wicckid</strong> (search out Bururu) &gt;&gt; <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (don't use effect for the meantime) &gt;&gt; <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (summon Splash Mage then use its effect) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong> (optional, depending on availability of elements required) &gt;&gt; <strong>Arrival</strong> (with ideally at least 5000 ATK). Of course, other cards (@Ignister effect monsters, resurrection spells, searching spells) are omitted in the sequence due to the indeterminate game state.  The logic behind the sequence is that the field spell <strong>Ignister AILand</strong> only allows you to special summon when there are no monsters on your Main Monster zone. These link monsters serve as buffers, which allow you to special summon @Ignister effect monsters from your hand or through spells (<strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong>). You have to keep track which @Ignister monsters have activated their effects due to the once per turn restriction.  Also, you must keep track of the elements of your summoned monsters in order to fulfill the requirements for Arrival. If you have <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (Earth), <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (Water), and <strong>another monster summoned by Splash Mage's effect</strong> while you have <strong>Doshin</strong> (Earth) and/or <strong>Hiyari</strong> (Water) on your hand, you can go for <strong>Dark Templar</strong> (Dark) and use its effect along with resurrection spells (<strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong>) or a search spell (<strong>AI Meet You</strong>) in order to bring out 5 different elements from the GY or hand. For emergencies, use <strong>Link Disciple</strong> (Light) to replace a redundant element.  When Link summoning, don't forget to start from the effect monsters all the way to the Link monsters in ascending Link rating; starting from the Link-3 <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> or <strong>Dark Templar</strong> will only allow you to select at most three other materials since <strong>Arrival</strong> is a Link-6 (This is for Dueling Nexus mechanics).  If you feel like you can't bring out 5000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong> due to the lack of resources, you can choose to go for other @Ignister monsters (<strong>Fire Phoenix</strong>, <strong>Light Dragon</strong>, etc.) or <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> for board cleaning.
