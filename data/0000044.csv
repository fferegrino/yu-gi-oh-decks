Mostly fusion summons but can still make synchros and,"This deck's main goal is to flood your field using Gilgamesh and Ragnarok to bring back D'Arc. The ideal hand is Swirl, Necro, Ragnarok and either Kepler or Contract with the Gate. To start the combo, fuse Swirl and Necro to make D'Arc using Swirl's effect, normal summon any low level D/D so you can use it and D'Arc to make Gilgamesh, use his effect to place Copernicus and Kepler in your pendulum zones and summon Ragnarok, use his effect to bring back D'Arc. After this depending on what you have leftover you can use Necro to summon another D'Arc or Ghengis, if you didn't use CwtG you can add a lamia to your hand and try for a synchro. Ghost is supposed to help with GY setup or returning the slimes from banishment if things go south. If Gilgamesh goes down, it's usually a good idea to summon Purple Armageddon with his effect.  P.S. This is probably the only ""good"" deck I will ever make."

After getting Supernaturalist (Assuming you also have Necrovalley) make sure you get hidden temples of necrovalley down to lock your opponent's special summons.

Pendulum/Synchro summons and Scrap monsters, swarming as well as recycling cards from the GY.","Hello! This deck is ripped straight from the PS4 game ""Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist."" As of May 23, 2019, Reinforcement of the Army is still limited to 1 copy, so make sure to take two copies out if you download this deck. As you can probably tell, this deck could not possibly keep up with today's decks, but it is a great casual deck to play around with and introduces yourself to Pendulum summons, Synchro summons, and the Scrap archetype. The goal of this deck first is to swarm the field using Pendulum summons, and recycle your Scrap monsters via their own effects second. Most of the Scrap monsters have the effect of returning a Scrap monster from GY to your hand as long a Scrap monster on your field was destroyed by a Scrap card's effect.  Your key monsters are Scrap Golem and Synchro-monster Scrap Dragon. Scrap Golem can special summon a Scrap monster from the GY to either player's field which will feed into the overall Scrap strategy. Scrap Dragon is your easiest useful Synchro Monster to Synchro summon and allows you to destroy 1 card on your opponent's field in exchange for one card you control, which can also trigger other Scrap monster effects.  Your Field Spell, Scrap Factory, is the third vital piece to this Scrap strategy, boosting Scrap-monster ATK/DEF slightly as well as allowing you to special summon a Scrap monster from the deck if a Scrap monster is destroyed by any card effect, including your opponent's, except during the damage step.  This deck is not very good and in need of many tune-ups, but it's a great deck to get started with and will destroy all of your friends' decks at the lunch table 100% guaranteed 50% of the time."

It's a very powerful deck and it is still even with <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> at one, you just have to learn to manage your resources. The goal of the deck is to go first and achieve a lot of draw power using Engage and then setting up multiple interruptions/negates using spells like Widow Anchor, Shark Cannon, Eagle Booster, Called By The Grave etc to stun your opponent consistently until you completely out grind them. After testing this build for a while ever since the release of the April 2019 banlist, I think it is really solid and I am hoping you guys will use it and enjoy it as much as I have. I hope you guys will use it to win since I've had much success with this build I created from scratch. Thank god for Hercules Base because it allows you to recur Kagari back into your extra deck so you can use it a second time, its first effect is also very powerful in battle. Equipping it to a Shizuku and then attacking your opponent's lowered attack monsters to draw 2 cards is busted. The last note I want to make is that I added <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> because you can actually go into it with 2 fire monsters like Hiita and Kagari, or whatever 2 fire monsters you can get. Link summoning Hiita and then using her effect to special summon a fire monster from your opponent's graveyard is normally the best way. The idea is to special summon a monster to the zone Sunlight Wolf points to below and use its effect to add back Kagari. This is an alternate option just in case you've already burned Hercules Base and the grind game is crucial. I love this as well because I play Ghost Cherries in the side deck because Sunlight Wolf is a Cherries target as well, and you can use Cherries for the mirror match. I hope you guys enjoy the deck and stick around for more!"

Its strategy is very straightforward  Activate mystic mine with the help of cards such as Metaverse and Traptrick  Protect it with field barrier and Dark bribes then use Ojama trio to fill your opponent's field to fulfill Mystic Mine's clause.  Use Michion to quickly lower your opponent's life points then use Raphion or the many burn cards at your disposal to win the duel very quickly  Needless to say, ensure that your opponent has more monsters than you do at all times so that you can use your timelords. Ojama trio helps with this.  I've yet to lose and duel in single mode using this deck.  Thank you for making such a stupid card, Konami!"

Force your opponent to play for you while you reap the benefits!,"This deck looks like a Graydle deck at a passing glance, but it is actually designed to capitalize on the opponent's plays while using as few resources as possible. The harder the opponent plays, the better this deck performs. You will note that the Side Deck has 15 cards of Kaiju support, and the Main Deck has 15 Graydle cards. These are meant to be interchanged to fully combat the biggest threats in the current meta. Either configuration is good for the Main Deck. I just chose Graydle for my personal preference.  The Extra Deck has a pretty standard Knightmare inclusion. <a data-name=""Graydle Dragon"">Graydle Dragon</a> is good for the Archetype. <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> has good usage with <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a> on board. <a data-name=""Dhampir Vampire Sheridan"">Dhampir Vampire Sheridan</a> is really easily accessed in full swing, and he allows for easy victory set-up. Destroy an opponent's Monster with his effect, take said Monster, and then use Sheridan and another monster to Link Summon a Knightmare and further destroy the opponent's board. It is very possible to get 2 Sheridan in one turn to set up an OTK. <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> are easy Link-4 Monsters that you will want almost any time you can get them. <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> is in the deck because... who doesn't want a free win against a popular deck? <a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a> is easily accessed with <a data-name=""Graydle Slime"">Graydle Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Graydle Slime Jr."">Graydle Slime Jr.</a> and any other Graydle Monster. I have also gotten him out by taken control of an opponent's tuner and using <a data-name=""Rose Token"">Rose Token</a>s.  At the end of the day, though, the Extra Deck is meant to throw away opponent's Monsters that would otherwise return to their control at the end of the turn.  Link Summoning has made the core Main Deck very versatile. 9 of the 40 cards in the Main Deck are Spell Cards that take the opponent's Monster until the end of the turn with various restrictions/costs. <a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a> is great for getting past ""Cannot be targeted..."" and ""Unaffected by..."" Monsters that would otherwise be problematic. <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> and <a data-name=""Contract with Don Thousand"">Contract with Don Thousand</a> are both meant to draw into the deck. The latter gives insight on the opponent's hand and could force them to play their spells at inconvenient times (or not summon).

The general strategy is try to get Dark magician on field as fast as possible, all three of them. I tossed in a Joke card or two into the side deck since I am not used to side decking, i.e Slifer the sky dragon. The biggest problem I have ever had with Dark magician is keeping up a decent hand size, it may be because I try to blow through all my resources as fast as possible. The deck itself also relies heavily on the starting hand, take this deck profile with a grain of salt as I don't play in tournaments too consistently."

Main Monsters(Crusadias):  3x Crusadia Arboria: She Protecc  3x Crusadia Maximus: He attac  3x Crusadia Leonis: But  3x Crusadia Reclusia: Most Importantly  3x Crusadia Draco: He makes your board so effing stupid...  Other monsters:  1x Amorphage Goliath: Summon it off Hieratic Seal to make your opponent quit playing Soli- I mean Yugioh.  2x Black Dragon Collapserpant: You can sub these in for something else.  Idk what else to really put in tho.  2x White Dragon Wyverbuster: Same with Wyver, I'm just lazy.  :/  2x Rescue Cat: Who knew a Cat could become a 1 card Naturia Beast?  1x Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest: What makes your Naturia Beast  1x Destrudo, The Lost Dragon's Frisson: Easiest Lvl 7 Synchro.  1x Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju: <a>https://www.google.com/search?q=kaiju&amp;rlz=1CAXWWL_enUS708US708&amp;oq=kaiju&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j0l3.2061j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;surl=1&amp;safe=active&amp;ssui=on</a>  Based on this, more annoying tho.  Summon it off Saryuja Skull Dread  1x Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon: More broken than a dropped glass vase.  1x World Legacy World Crown: Basically Amorphage Goliath but negates and destroys :)  Spells (Magic :o)  3x Called By The Grave: The TCG version of Nobleman of Crossout  1x Dragon Shrine: Bottom text  1x Foolish Burial: SEND YOUR DESTRUDO!!!!!!  3x Kyoutou Waterfront: What makes Gameciel so annoying to your opponent.  1x Monster Reborn: Bottom Text  1x World Legacy Succession: Bottom Text  1x World Legacy Guardragon: Get Draco back.  Or if you're using Succession or Reborn, get Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon  2x Twin Twisters: You can always side it out.  Extra Deck:  1x Naturia Beast: See to Rescue Cat  1x Clear Wing Synchro Dragon: Could also run F.A. Dawn Dragster but I prefer Clear Wing bc we have Beast and Twin Twisters for Spells and Traps  1x PSY-Framelord Omega: Could also sub this in for another Guardragon Target but I like Omega because he's a lvl 8 beater that can shuffle himself back into the extra in case he's Zaborg'd or he's negated.  1x Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy: Wow, what a name.  Too bad I don't have a lot of patience writing this.  1x Crusadia Equimax: For the OTK.  Easy to make and can quickly negate anything your opponent does.  2x Crusadia Magius:  Practically need two.  Basically a backup plan to make Equimax  2x Crusadia Spatha: See to Magius  1x of each Guardragon link monster: Broken  1x Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres: Make your Guardragons into this.  Very abusable effect  1x Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax: Another Generic OTK potential.  It is so powerful because your opponent has to attack it.  And since most likely your opponent will Special Summon that powerful monster, it just gains it's attack and it can't be targeted at all.  1x Saryuja Skull Dread: What makes running Gameciel in this deck good.  Side Deck:  6x of any Kaiju: Useful to break a Sky Striker board or a Salad deck.  3x Interrupted Kaiju Slumber: Breaks boards and gives you some combo potential with Waterfront  1x Twin Twisters: For Mine or any sort of Backrow deck  3x Red Reboot: For Mine and Altergeist  2x Black Garden: Use this to spam a Salamangreat player.  Since the tokens are Plant and all of the Salad Link monsters require Cyberse monsters, your opponent will need some sort of Token targets to make a Borrelsword Dragon"

Every card in the deck is built around this guy. Your goal is to get him out on the playing field ASAP with supporting monsters to bring out any of the Synchros you see fit. -Quickdraw Synchron: The second staple of the deck. Quickdraw is what will allow you to pull out the Warrior cards that aren't Junk Warrior. It's effect also makes it easier to activate Junk Synchron's effect when you normal summon it, as you'll be discarding a card to special summon Quickdraw.(You generally never tribute for it) -Level Eater: This guy is perfect for increasing Junk Warrior's attack when you summon it, and it also works wonders paired with Quickdraw to open up more Synchro choices, even allowing you to summon Junk Warrior with Quickdraw. -Synchron Explorer: Basically has the reverse effect of Junk Synchron. Whenever you normal summon it, you can pull Junk or Quickdraw from your graveyard for easier Synchro summons. -Salvage Warrior: This is the only monster you'll be tribute summoning, and for good reason too. Whenever you can get him out, you should be doing so, as he'll enable some of the higher level synchro summons with Junk Synchron such as Stardust Dragon or Junk Destroyer. -Mystic Tomato: Mystic Tomato is only here so you can pull out Junk Synchron with more ease. -Junk Servant: Pairs excellently with Junk Synchron, as whenever you have Junk Synchron out on the field, you get to freely summon him and you can then Synchro summon any level 7 Synchro immediately. -Junk Blader: This guy is here simply to help out with pulling Junk Servant out, aiding in Synchro summoning, and can serve as a great starter monster due to it's 1800 attack. -Quillbolt Hedgehog: Almost a necessity to use in a Synchron deck due to it's effect, and pairs the best with Junk Synchron in particular. He helps pull out Junk Warrior in a snap.  -Mystical Space Typhoon: This deck lacks punishing spells/traps and gets rolled by stall decks that run Swords of Revealing Light, so this card will help relieve some of that pressure, and plus, it's always a good card to have in any deck. -Raigeki: You can replace this with Dark Hole if you want, but this is to pull the playing field in your favor if your opponent manages to get the upper hand. -Reinforcement of the Army: This card should almost solely be used to bring out Junk Synchron, but there's no harm in pulling out Blader or Servant. -Swords of Revealing Light: Simply here for some extra protection, that never hurts to have. -The Warrior Returning Alive: Allows you to continually reuse Junk Synchron for multiple Synchro summons. -Tuning: The most important Spell you have, you'll be able to freely bring in Quickdraw or Junk thanks to it, and when bringing out Junk, you have the potential to get a card like Quillbolt or Explorer sent to your graveyard from the top of your deck for even easier Synchro summoning. -Battleguard Howling: Similar to Swords, this is another protection card, and this one actually bites your opponent back. Helps keep your Warriors alive as well. -Call of the Haunted: Pretty self-explanatory, allows you to reuse Synchros in the Graveyard or your Synchrons if needed. -Mirror Force: Another protection card, and one you'll want to save for when your opponent REALLY gets the upper hand. -Pinpoint Guard: This trap allows you to reuse Junk Synchron even more, and safeguards it during your opponent's battle phase. -Scrap-Iron Scarecrow: More protection, and a reusable one at that. If your opponent doesn't have much to deal with Spells or Traps, this will be a HUGE headache for them. -Spirit Force: Ask for more protection? Here you go! Not only that, but this card will also help bring Junk Synchron back from the grave.  -Chevalier de Fleur: Your one monster that grants you the ability to negate spell/trap activation, this card and Road Warrior will specifically require Level Eater to use it's effect on Quickdraw, so it's a little difficult to bring out, but not impossible, and very strong when brought out. -Colossal Fighter: This is an AMAZING Synchro for this deck, as it will allow to bring out destroyed Warriors if it gets destroyed itself, and it also gains extra attack based on the amount of Warrior-type monsters are in your graveyard.(there will be quite a bit) -Drill Warrior: This guy here, just like Chevalier and Road, will specifically need Quickdraw + Level Eater, but for a different reason, obviously. This card is great for bringing back your Synchrons from the grave due to it's effect. -Junk Berserker: This card is extremely powerful and can punish your opponent for playing a bit too aggressively. In this deck you can lower a monster's attack by 1300, 1500, 1800, 2300, 2600, and 2700 due to it's effect. Then to make it even scarier, it also punishes defensive play since it instantly destroys defense position monsters you attack with it. -Junk Destroyer: You'll generally want to bring him out with multiple non-tuners to take full advantage of his effect. Destroying high attack monsters and pesky traps/spells is the goal with him. -Junk Gardna: This card can be swapped with whatever you deem fit, but I have it here as a simple defensive pick. Making sure you don't get field wiped by a Mirror Force if you see it coming for example. -Junk Warrior: Probably the most common thing you'll be summoning with Junk Synchron. It's not the most powerful trick up this deck's sleeve, but when executed correctly, you can have him with over 3000 attack. -Nitro Warrior: This card is very fun when you get it out early and use it in conjunction with your spells, as it will gain 1000 attack and be able to attack twice if your opponent has a second monster in face-up defense position. So it's somewhat situational, but it has a high attack stat and isn't a bad card to bring out at all. -Road Warrior: If you can bring this guy out quickly, do it! You can even add an extra of him and bring in Road Synchron if you want, as you can continually pull out monsters for Junk/Quickdraw to Synchro summon with. -Stardust Dragon: This card is more or less your insurance card. You should generally always bring it out if you're expecting cards like Dark Hole, Raigeki, Mirror Force, etc... to come into play. -Turbo Warrior: Probably the most situational Synchro in the deck, but if you're expecting to go up against other Synchro cards, you'll be glad you brought him"

Card car d should be used at the end after you used all your draw cards. rainbow life should be used when your opponent attacks to gain life points also if you have shaddoll beast in your hand when you use rainbow life discard that to draw 1 more card. I have played 20 duel with this deck I lost 2 won 13 in two turns won 3 in three turns and 2 times in one turn. super fun deck. no one likes mystic mine so this deck is mystic mine free. if you want you add mystic mine but I wont cause playing against mine is no fun.

So we have two main functions of this deck here: ""Send to the GY"" and ""Special Summon from the GY"".  Cards that send monsters to the graveyard (from the deck or hand): <ul>  	<li>Paladin of Felgrand: You can equip a high level dragon from your deck to it; when it leaves from the field, that monster is sent to the graveyard as well. So this card send a monster to the gy indirectly.</li>  	<li>Morphing Jar: It discards your entire hand.</li>  	<li>Dragon Ravine: You can send up to 2 monsters to the gy per turn as 1 from each your hand (cost) and deck (second effect).</li>  	<li>Dragon Shrine: Up to 2 dragons to the gy.</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial: 1 monster.</li>  	<li>Twin Twisters: You can use its cost to send a monster to the gy.</li>  	<li>Trade-In: 1 dragon.</li> </ul> Cards that special summon monsters:  (from the hand) <ul>  	<li>Paladin of Felgrand</li>  	<li>Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</li>  	<li>Kidmodo Dragon</li> </ul> (from the graveyard) <ul>  	<li>Arkbrave Dragon</li>  	<li>Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand: by destroying a monster by battle.</li>  	<li>Paladin of Felgrand</li>  	<li>Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon: by destroying a monster by battle.</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon: 1 ss per turn.</li>  	<li>Decoy Dragon</li>  	<li>Monster Reborn</li>  	<li>Return of the Dragon Lords</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Tips  To get rid of a monster your oppenent controls: <ul>  	<li>You can special summon Felgrand from the graveyard so that you can banish that monster, also it has its atk and def increased. This works for also getting rid of a monster in your oppenent's gy that repatedly turns back to the field.</li>  	<li>You can tribute summon Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon (can use a high level monster or keeper of the shrine to summon easier) so that you can destroy that monster, also inflict effect damage to your opponent.</li> </ul> To get rid of spell/trap cards your oppenent controls: <ul>  	<li>You can special summon Arkbrave Dragon if the cards are face-up. Also Arkbrave Dragon gains attack and defence.</li>  	<li>You can summon Dragon Spirit of White.</li>  	<li>Also you have twin twisters.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  *If you control any monster, you can use Paladin of Felgrand's effect to special summon a dragon from your deck.  *To special summon a monster that in your hand or deck, you can send both it and Arkbrave Dragon to the gy so that you can summon it in your oppenent's turn.  *If you have a high level monster in your hand and Dragon Ravine, discard that monster and send Arkbrave Dragon from your deck to the gy, then special summon that monster.  *Dragon Spirit of White is treated as normal monster in the gy. So you can send it from the deck to the gy by Dragon Shrine to send one more card.  *You can use Foolish Burial to send Kidmodo Dragon if you want special summon from your hand, or to send Arkbrave Dragon if you want to special summon from your graveyard.  *Use Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon to summon Full Armor Photon Dragon or Dark Matter Dragon. You can also use Dark Matter's effect to send dragons to the gy.  *You can use Arkbrave Dragons to summon Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon, and Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon to summon Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon.  *You can use side deck to create different variations of this deck."

It's not the most effective variant, admittedly, but I love the archetype and wanted to make a deck using only Gravekeeper's as main deck monsters.  The general strategy is to get Visionary and Supernaturalist on the board as fast as you can in order to secure a strong board presence. This is usually done with Dark Renewal on a throw-away like Recruiter, or using Spiritualist through either Monster Reborn, Headman, Throne, or anything in-between. There is also a good line-up of Xyz and Link monsters that help in a win more or comeback situation, like Lightning and Skull Dread.  The most obscure choices are just personal preferences I have either due to nostalgia or just generally liking the card. I can swear to you right now that if a deck has at least 2 level 4 monsters in it, you can be damn sure I'm going to put Cowboy in my extra deck. Always.  The side deck is mainly just for the hell of it. Mind Crush, Seven Tools, and Dark Bribe are favorites from my early days of Yugioh and I love using them as Side Deck filler. It is a casual deck after all."
