This in fact does affect dragon link but not that much. This is the post banlist version of dragon link, it is in fact not as good as the original but can still need on the exact same end board with more extenders. I made this deck in a way that you would consistently draw a hand to fo full combo, I would say we just have to wait for the meta to shape up and see where dragon link is compared to the other decks! It will definitely be meta but just not the best deck of the format or anything. Have fun playing!         </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you wish to hand rip and extra card from the opponent’s hand instead of drawing 2 cards with crocodragon, the you can switch it out for trishula (the synchro monster). Also make sure to answer the poll question down below! Today’s poll question is: Which of your banlist predictions didn’t happen? If you are interested in an in-depth deck explanation and combo tutorial, I recommend watching my youtube video, subscribe to the channel and like the video - it is a great way to support me and the channel. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmliyvnBXKU</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks and I’ll see you next time! :D                                  </span>"

Here's Dino's that utilizes a Rescue Rabbit engine and other fairly unorthodox stuff. While this is still  meta, it does have a few things to note that sets it apart from other Dino decks. Credit to Rondasrich for his Dino builds, they were a great help in building this. Might make Invoked Dinos in the future, who knows. <span>Deck guide <span>2x Tyranno- The main boss monster, Tyranno is great and aggresive. He can easily clear out entire boards, deal huge damage, and deal a little extra burn damage from the face down effect alongside that. This makes Tyranno an amazing boss monster that's hard to interrupt due to Misc and Lost World. You can also easily get it out due to how many Dino's will be in the grave, and how Double Evo can get it out easily, since it negates its summoning conditions. </span></span>1x Pankratops- Pankratops is a great choice as it's more dinosaur fodder that can easily special summon itself and gives you a free pop to remove problem cards or draw out negates. You can also just altogether not use Pankratop's pop and use it as fodder for Tyranno or something like that. 1x Petiteradon- Petiteradon allows you to get out Oviraptor, Pankratops, and Megalo easily. It can easily be popped by Oviraptor, making it easy to get into more monsters to extend your plays. Fun fact: It has the egg on top of it's head because it summons high leveled monsters. 3x Oviraptor- Oviraptor is a huge playmaker for the deck, and for a good reason. On any sort of summon, it searches a majority of the deck, filling in the gaps of your hand and providing more monsters for your plays. And Oviraptor is able to pop another dino to special a dino from the grave, which is just pure advantage as long as you pop Pepiteradon or Babyceraarus. 3x Misc- Have you read it? Jokes aside, Misc gives full protection to all your dinosaurs from opponent's effects, making them immune. This is even better because this is a discard cost to activate it, making it a quick effect, and it's graveyard set up. And in the grave, Misc banishes itself and other Dino's to special a Dino from deck who's level adds up to the number of Dino's banished from grave. Misc should've been banned but Konami is stupid. 3x Babycerasauras- Babycerausarus (god i always struggle to spell it's name) is great for is pop effect. On destruction, it specials a level 4 or lower Dino from deck. this is a great effect, as it's easy to prop by Oviraptor and is very helpful to extend your plays. Fun fact: Baby's shell is on it's bottom because it only summons level 4 or lower monsters. 3x Archosaur- Archosaur serves to be that one card in the deck to be super expensive for no reason and ruin the idea of it possibly being a good budget option. Archosaur,  on summon, pops another dino on field or in hand (so it can prop the babies or it can even pop cards in the hand for more graveyard setup) to fetch a Double Evo Pill. Double Evo Pill is great as it allows you to easily get into Tyranno. 3x Rescue Rabbit- Rescue Rabbit is another one of the deck's playmakers. It serves to summon two Megalosmasher's from deck, which is great for starting or extending plays and  shitting out more Dino's.  Also the non-Dino for Double Evo, alongside Ash. Megalosmasher X- Mainly just exists to be summoned off of Rabbit, so it's a complete garnet in hand, which is a pain. The best it can do is be popped by Archosaur or be banished away for Tyranno or Double Evo. It was only chosen because it's a vanilla dino with the highest attack. 1x Light barrier- An idea i borrowed from Ronda, Light Barrier serves to be a big floodgate. Since our boss monster is a Light, this can easily cripple the opponent's plays as long as we drop it around the end of our plays. Light's aren't super common rn either, so that's nice. 3x Ash Blossom- Ash Blossom serves to interrupt and destroy plays from the opponent, as it can easily stop searches (which decks rely on), and well timed, it can stop entire plays and combos. Just don't drop it on the first thing you see. And no, Jobe, it's not getting limited. 3x Lost World- Lost world serves multiple purposes. Since it summons a token to your opponent's field, while yes, it is fodder for the opponent, it does give you an extra layer of protection alongside Misc, making it insanely hard to out your high attack dino's. Aditionally, Lost World nerfs the attack of non-dino's, making it much easier to beat over your opponent's monsters (unless you're in a mirror match). 3x Fossil Dig- Fossil Dig is the deck's Rota, but unlimited, as it searches nearly all of the deck and gives you everything you need. It also doesn't have a once per turn, meaning you can shit out fossil digs whenever you want. I'm also pretty sure the paper airplane guys are on the art. 2x Double Evo- Double Evo is the main way to turbo into Tyranno, as it banishes the Dino's you've shat out into the grave to get out a Tyranno easily and ignores it's summoning conditions, making it easier to get. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming easily searches out Lost World, as Lost World is a fantastic card. 1x One for One- One for One gives you graveyard setup and gets you out Archosaur, easily. 1x Foolish Burial- Foolish also gives you more Graveyard setup for other cards like Tyranno and Misc. 1x Monster Reborn- Monster Reborn can easily bring back your Tyranno or something of the sort if it's popped. 3x Extravagance- The deck's main draw power, Extrav banishes your useless extra deck and gives you extra draws. I'm not going to go through the extra deck. It's all banish fodder with fringe uses sometimes. <span>Playing guide <span>The main goal is to turbo out Conductor and shat out your Dino's on the way. At the start of the turn, the priority is to activate Lost World or search and activate it, and activate Misc (or search and activate it), to ensure you have protection for your plays. Afterwards, you'll want to do the usual shit. Summon out Oviraptor to pop the baby's and get out all the monsters you need, get out your Archosaur and use it's eff to pop Oviraptor and search Double Evo, use Double Evo and go into Conductor and drop the Barrier around the end. Once you have Conductor on the field, you're good to go to OTK. Along the way, you can also SS Pankratops for the pop and use the Rabbit strat, to get out the Megalo's for more fodder for other Dino's and such. </span></span>Any suggestions and such is appreciated.

I've had a lot of fun with it and it is incredibly consist,"Basically, the strategy is to demolish you opponent. Going first, I try to get our either Risen-Dragite and Abyss Dweller or Crystal Wing and Naturia Beast in order to have a few play interrupters  on the field for my opponents turn. Going second, also isn't very difficult depending on how many negates you opponent has. Usually the ultimate goal is to go into Risen-Dragite in order to non-target remove most of my enemy's cards. This works incredibly well by setting up the top 5 cards of your deck with the field spell."

Going second there are plenty of hand traps to keep your counter play manageable. I am not a huge fan of playing three Aleisters but after playing with the deck it is extremely helpful to have him + Adin to start. With these two cards you can potentially go into Dragoon and Mechaba. You play Aleister, search invocation, link aliester off into Almiraj. Here is way the combo changes path from the normal one just a little. Instead of linking into Gardna you special summon Adin from hand and link into Verte. I do not know why but everyone assumes Adin locks you out of the extra deck but this is not the case. Now you have Aleister and a light in grave with Verte on field. Fuse into Mechaba, bring aliester back, and now you have protection to use Verte to go into Dragoon. This combo can also be played with ANY of the dogmatika monsters expect for the newest one and I guess Max because he needs a extra deck monster in grave. IF you do not activate Ecclesia's second effect to search then you are not locked out of the extra deck. The new dogmatika is played for an easy special summon and if played with punishment it will recur Punishment back to hand.  If you can not get into Dragoon or Mechaba this deck can play through the Dogmatika engine, in particular Punishment. I chose book of moon instead of another imper because book of moon seems to be better against zoodiac but I could be wrong. Finally, Adin is a super over looked card in my opinion it can hold of Extra deck focused decks by not being able to be destroyed by battle plus on destruction he searches Ecclesia which then can search something else. This deck is really consistent and pretty fun to play.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I'm not mad... just disappointed  Edit:  When I made this deck it was really just for me to bitch about VFD still being around (clearly), but I never expected it to be my most viewed deck, and I wasn't very proud of it, so I made some adjustments to the deck so that I may not hate it any more. I was right that VW would be one of the best decks in the upcoming format (because it's really good even without VFD (except for when it isn't)). I made a lot of dumb mistakes in the original build, like not playing cloudcastle or desires, I have fixed that now, as well as putting in zeus because it's really good. I also added the Ultimaya Tzolkin engine because it seems really cool and the deck can do it really easily, there's also a better rank 6 toolbox in the updated version, but that isn't the most important thing for the deck.

I've worked a lot on this deck, it work very well now.  Concept : we use 2 copies of Numeron 2, 3 and 4 and 3 of Numeron 1. The fact is that we use 3 of them (Number 2, 3 and 4) to summon S0. 4 of them to summon Numeron C1 and to finish only Numeron 1 to summon C1 again.  <span>The strategy </span>  <span>If you go first : </span> <ol>  	<li>Summon 3 Numeron monsters (Number 2, 3 and 4, <strong>not Number 1</strong>) and then, summon S0 Utopic ZEXAL</li>  	<li>During the opponent turn : <ol>  	<li>If you have Sauravis in your hand, you can use the effect of S0 directly at the draw phase because it will be protected of Impermanence.</li>  	<li>If you don't have Sauravis in your hand, wait your opponent to use Impermanence on S0, then chain with S0 effect (it's quick effect).</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>During your second turn, 2 options here : <ol>  	<li>If S0 has survived, you can summon Downerd Magician and the Zeus with 4 materials... :). Then, if you can, set Forbidden Droplet to protect Zeus and use your Numeron Network already on the field to active Forbidden Droplet. In fact we don't care about Numeron Network that is already on the field if Zeus is on the field because of Zeus effect : free Forbidden Droplet !</li>  	<li>If S0 did not survived, you can summon your 4 Numeron Cards and then try to OTK your opponent.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>If you didn't succeed to OTK your opponent, summon Number C1 Sunya and then use One Day of piece or set 1 Unchained if you can in order to survive. Normally here your opponent didn't have any monsters on the field, so you should survive another turn.</li>  	<li>If your opponent is still alive : <ol>  	<li>If you have Numeron Network on your GY or banished, you have an Unchained monster in your hand and another Numeron Network active. Go to NUMBER C1000 and iC1000 if you have this opportunity !!!</li>  	<li>If you can't summon Number C1000. Go to another Number C1 and banish again all your opponent monsters on the field. The next turn, if you survive your opponent will receive +8000 damage points.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <span>If you go second : </span>  Do the same if you can, or if your opponent already have a fat board. Go OTK with Forbidden Droplet + Numeron OR Red Reboot + Numeron OR Number C1 to banish all his monsters and try to go C1000 if you can.  &nbsp;  Have fun.  &nbsp;  <hr />  Note : you can use Red Reboot to : <ol>  	<li>Protect S0 when attacking, just before summoning Zeus. The opponent will have to set another trap card... And with Zeus you can then destroy all his cards on the field + 1 other trap card... Hehe !</li>  	<li>Protect your Numeron monsters when trying to OTK</li> </ol>"

They are a means to an end that terminates at ABC-Dragon Buster (ABC-DB). Dogmatika is resilient, Ecclesia &amp; Fleurdelis have staying power and the potential to swarm. Each offensive battle makes them more difficult to beat over. And so, here's how I've made two unlikely archetypes into a whole: Ojamatika.  Let's start with the Ojamas. Get them out of your hand an into the graveyard, ideally one each of the trio. Ojama blue can be used to search any two card combination of Ojamassimilation, Ojama Pajama, Ojamagic, and Ojamatch. My go-to is Ojamassimilation and Ojama Pajama. As with the Ojamas, the A-, B-, C- union pieces need to be out of the hand. B- can search A-, A- can get back B-, and B- can search again for C-. However many union pieces are still within the deck are how many Ojamas are needed for Ojamassimilation, as a minimum. Ojamagic is useful here as this card will get green, yellow, and black into the hand. From here, either use Ojamassimilation immediately, or wait for Ojama Red (perhaps searched for with Ojamatch, pitching Ojamagic and using the effect to normal summon Armed Dragon, followed by the turn normal summon of Red) to summon the whole lot and link into Saryuja. Either way, bansih the trio with Ojamassimilation and return them to the deck while also drawing a card. Assemble the brought forth Union pieces into ABC-DB. In the next turn, you can search for another copy of Ojamagic with Pajama and either discard it immediately, or use it for the cost of ABC-DB giving four turns worth of fuel for ABC-DB. Two copies of Ojamassimilation are included for two reasons. One, as back-up, and two, vanilla ojamas early on can quickly become Union pieces (generally being more substantial).  While the Ojama trio was butting in by any means necessary, elements of the Dogmatika engine were likely coming in. I typically use them as I see the need; however, there is a nice set-up which this deck adopts from more artistic deck designers, and it goes a little something like this...: Use Nadir to pitch Apkallone which searches for Schism and promptly sending it to grave (if Schism is already in hand with an Ojamagic, discard Ojamagic),get Maximus. Special Summon Maximus and activate them to send down Titaniklad and Construct, set Schism. At the end of turn, Special Summon Ecclessia by effect of Titaniklad, and use Ecclessia's effect to search Fleurdelis. During the opponents Main Phase, activate Schism to Fusion Summon Winda. I typically wait until their's a problem effect monster on my opponent's field to bring out Fleurdelis. And that's really about all I have to say about the Dogmatika crew...  For general strategy, I use ABC-DB to blow face-down cards and backrow, fueled by Ojamas; the Dogmatika beatdown my opponent's monsters. When necessary or just to flex, I use Dogmatika punishment to smite with Psy-Framelord Omega which allows me to recover them self and another card (perhaps the Punishment previously activated, an N'tss, or a fallen Fleurdelis). Super Polymerization is good for pitching Ojamas/Ojamagic (be vigilant as to whats on the field, Dogmatika are light-spellcasters and Ojama are light-beasts, targets for Mudragon).

It's fairly similar to the one I built for Cryptid's tourney (before I got banned), just with some much needed modifications. Credit to Toon and the Halqifibrax PFP man for helping me with the equip part.  A good few of the equip's, if not all, will prob get banned but whatever. Also, I'd like to point out that what's really notable with this deck is how it can switch between an aggresive focus, combo, and control at a breakneck speed. It can summon powerful monsters like Rebellion to easily push for game, pull off large and over complicated combos, but also easily switch off of that to control the tempo with stupid shit like Fog Blade. PK's and their support in Phantom Rage have a lot of interesting potential for degeneracy. Also i've been calling Arc Rebellion Rebellion most of the guide so ignore that <span>Deck guide</span>  3x Cloak- Cloak is a monster you want to keep in the deck, but is too good to run at any lower numbers. Just hope you don't draw into it.  Cloak searches out literally any card of the archetype, which means you want to be dumping it into the grave as soon as possible by using it as XYZ or link material or sending it by Boots. You can easily send it by Boots from the deck, or you can normal summon it and link it off for Isolde or Bardiche. 3x Boots- Boots is another one of the deck's big playmakers, as it SS's itself as long as you control a PK. This effect is quite solid for field presence, and gathering up enough Dark's/Warrior's/Level3's. You can also normal summon Boots in a pinch and use it with Kage, although it's better to SS it. And in the grave, it searches any PK spell/trap, which means an instant fog blade, sword, or briganade. The best targets are Fog Blade and Sword, as you can get Fog Blade for a more control focused game if that's what you're going for, or a Sword to help buff up your Isolde or Bardiche that are on the field. But you can also use it to fetch a Briganade to extend plays, as a Briganade plus the two Dark warrior's from Isolde means a Bardiche.  Forgot to mention, it can also get Rank Up to turbo into the XYZ Dragons to finish off the game. 3x Gloves- Gloves gives a 1k boost to the dark XYZ, helping to push them to higher attack levels and push for an OTK due to the insane attack strength effect of Rebellion. And in the grave, Gloves can send any PK monster, to basically extend plays and fill in the gaps of whatever you need in your hand since so many of them are searchers. 3x Spained Greaves- Spained Greaves is another one of the extenders, as alongside Boots it SS's itself (although on a much tighter condition). Spained Greaves is really helpful for getting more monsters on the field, as he can help to get out at least 3 Dark's and turbo into a Bardiche on turn 1. In the grave, he can special another PK from your hand, and he can increase it's level by 1. You rarely, if ever, want to increase the level, but the effect in general is fairly nice for extending plays or for making more monsters mid to late game. 3x Torn Scales- the one card that Konami just had to make expensive for no reason and ruin the idea of PK being a fairly nice budget option. Anyway, Torn Scales gives you graveyard setup and props the discard effects of the Dangers! on discard, or can do double graveyard setup. This effect is fantastic, as the PK's are very graveyard relient. And in the grave, when another PK banishes for cost, it special's itself, which is great for extending plays. Danger! engine- They all do the same thing, so i'm not gonna explain them all one by one. They're all Darks that can special summon themselves easily and can (potentially) discard PK cards for more graveyard setup. As Dark's on the field, they're great targets for Fog Blade. 3x Kagemucha Knight- Kagemucha Knight is a great monster, as most of the monsters in the deck are level 3. So you can easily special summon it, and it has particular synergy since it's a Dark warrior, making it work hand in hand as Isolde fodder/target, and fodder for Bardiche. 3x Rank-Up- Rank-Up is great for ranking your Break Sword up into one of the XYZ dragons. Since you'll be dumping out so many Dark's, you can easily banish a few to rank up the Bardiche directly into Rebellion. Rebellion heavily punishes swarm decks, as it steals their attack and in certain situations can push for game all on it's own. Mid-to late game you can make a break sword, rank it up into Rebellion and push for game. 1x Rota- Literally searches most of the deck, filling in the gaps of your hand to get you whatever you need. It's limited for a reason. 3x Desires- The main draw spell, Desires's is technically a -7 (i probably did that math wrong but whatever) but is completely worth it, due to how good drawing 2 is.  Just make sure you use it after using Isolde, so you don't banish any precious equips. 1x Hautaclere- Hautaclere is mainly useful for enabling powerful monsters like Rebellion and a beefed up Bardiche to attack twice, which can easily help push for game. And on destruction of the equipped monster, it gets a pop, which is a pretty nice bonus. 1x Pheonix Blade- Ah yes, the banned-in-the-OCG card. Phoenix blade is mainly good for looping, as as long as you dump a good amount of warriors to the grave, you can continually loop Phoenix Blade for a good while. 1x Smoke Grenade- Smoke Grenade is a great target for the sorta-cost of Rusty's pop, as it gives you a hand rip and info on the opponent, and also a great target for Bardiche's pop. Generally a really good card. 3x Fog Blade- The main card that Bardiche searches, Fog Blade is great for more of a control focus. It  can allow you to basically shut down the opponent's strongest monsters or their key combo pieces while they're still in the middle of their combo, basically interrupting everything they're doing and leaving them open for you to hit hard. And in the grave, it can SS a PK from the grave, making it a control card and combo extender. 3x Sword- Sword allows you to buff the Isolde and Bardiche that are left on the field, which is what I mainly use it for, as they're valuable monsters I don't want run over. Although, you can also use Sword to buff other stuff like Rebellion when you're gonna push for game. Sword is another good target for Bardiche, when you're out of Fog Blade. And, in the grave, it does the same thing as Fog Blade, making it an aggresive card/extender. 2x Briganade- Briganade is fantastic for being a trap that can be activated easily, as you shouldn't be having many traps in the grave, if any, when you activate Briganade, which makes it much faster than normal traps. It also is great fodder for Bardiche and Isolde. Sadly, it has no GY effect. <span>The extra deck <span>3x Break Sword- One of the first cards to summon, Break Sword has some nice removal. When summoning it, you'll probably not use it's effect and try to immediately rank it up. Although, if you have a Infernoble Equip (it's name is too hard to spell for a second time) or a Smoke Grenade in hand, you can equip either to him and pop one for advantage on the opponent.  Then rank it up. </span></span>2x Alucard- Alucard's only really here because it's another Dark XYZ. But i mean, it can hurt Altergeist, so that's a plus. 1x Dark Rebellion- Dark Rebellion is rarely used, but can be of use sometimes if you don't have enough darks to push for Arc Rebellion. 1x Arc Rebellion- Arc Rebelllion is a all around fantastic beater. Due to it's effect, it can grow to huge level's of strength against most of the decks that are played nowadays, due to how many montsers they have on the field. And combined with cards like Sword and the Infernoble equip, it can finish the game in one turn. Just be wary of battle traps. 3x Zeus- If you don't have a rank-up spell, this is what you want to rank up Break Sword into. Zeus is quick effect, non targeting, non destruction removal, which is fantastic, as it avoids so many effects nowadays and it's very hard to respond to. Zeus is also a 3k beater and all around great card. 2x Isolde- a key playmaker of the deck, Isolde allows you to special out a monster and gain advantage from sent cards. also, mommy milkers. 1x Bardiche- A key card of the deck, Bardiche is something you want to turbo into. Bardiche helps to set up strong backrow with Fog Blade/Sword, allowing you to easily control the game and hit hard at the same time. Additionally, it sets up the grave as it searches and gets to pop cards as you make your XYZ. 2x Avramax- Avramax is another option late game, in case you've ran out of a lot of your other cards and need to close off the game. <span>Playing guide <span>Well, here we are. The deck's main focus is to shit out as many monsters as possible, using stuff like Boots, Spained Greaves, etc and the Danger! engine  for their special summoning effects.. Afterwards, make an Isolde, get out tons more monsters and make a Bardiche. Banish your cards to get tons more resources back and to prop other card's effects. Set up strong backrow and control the gamestate from there And then on turn 2, you go into your powerful XYZ like Rebellion or Zeus, and either continue wittling down the opponent from there, or close off the game in one fell swoop. </span></span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Have a good day!"

Handtraps help achieving that, as well as cards like ""widow anchor"" &amp; ""shark cannon"".</span>  <em><span><strong>In-Depth:</strong></span></em>  The goal going 1st is, to be able to disrupt the opponent with handtraps, Sky Striker Spells &amp; Machina Citadel, so that he can not buid a board on his own and has to pass on very few cards, which have no disruptive effects. Once the gamestate is slowed down, its sky strikers turn to shine. The deck is very good at generating ressources with cards like Area Zero, Kagari, Shizuku &amp; Multirole. The Machina Engine helps with that. Besides Citadel being a boss monster for the deck, the trap (Machina Overdrive) can recycle Sky Striker Link Monsters from grave and the banished zone to get an additional draw. That makes it a very good foolish burial goods target, just to get ressources back and generate a draw. Also you can send the trap to the grave with Area Zero to get an excate plus recycling and a draw, so thats pretty neat. The trap also special summons from hand, so even if you drew your Citadel you can still use it.  <strong>Its very important, </strong>that if you drew Raye or Roze and Machina Overdrive and you dont have another Sky Striker Monster, you use the endphase-search-effect of Shizuku to search Hornet-Drones, to make sure you have a monster going into your next turn. You need it, because Machina Overdrive destroys your own monster (not as cost) in order to special summon the citadel from deck. So next turn you have to have a sky striker monster or Hornet-Drones to be able to play. <strong>Also </strong>i would suggest you use your sky striker spells before you activate Machina Overdrive because Citadel prevents you from activating them. Then again, it's a Quick-effect so you can just use it to nuke itself and the opponents board free your Main Monster zone. Also, if your opponent activates a card like Lightning Storm as their first card you can at least have a Quick-Effect-Raigeki to disrupt your opponent instead of having nothing. You can also use it, when your sky striker monster is targetted for an effect, that would destroy it, so you would lose your Monster anyways but that way you at least get a boss monster on your board. In case you have Raye in grave you can also just special summon it back from grave, wait for battle phase, use its effect to special summon kaina, to make 1 monster unable to attack this turn and afterwards activate Overdrive to special summon Citadel and nuke the opponents board in the battle phase (of course you use Kaina's effect on a monster which has more than 3000 Atk, because this monster will not be destroyed by Citadel.  Machina Citadel can be special summoned from grave, when Kaina (Machine; Earth) gets destroyed by battle or card effect. So you can run into a bigger monster with Kaina, to special summon from grave both Raye &amp; Citadel. Then you have a Quick-Effect Raigeki (3000 Atk Beater) and can use Raye's effect to tag out into hayate for 1500 damage. So it helps dealing with opponents monsters on both turns (non-targeting), as well as dealing damage. If you need to get rid of Citadel, you can just use Area Zero's effect on it to excavate 3 and add 1 ""Sky Striker""-Spell and chain the effect of Citadel to nuke the opponents board. Then, as I mentioned before, you can get it back from the grave with Kaina.  As an additional boss monster the deck has access (no pun intended) to <strong>Accesscode-Talker</strong>. <strong>Ningirsu</strong> can help to get to Accesscode Talker if you play it like this: Use your opponents monsters you stole with widow anchor or Shark Cannon or your own link monsters (Zeke &amp; 1 other) to go into Ningirsu. Make sure Area Zero is on the field. Then you use the effect of Ningirsu to non-target send one card on either side of the board to the graveyard. On your own board you send the Area Zero which triggers in grave to special summon 1 ""Sky Striker Ace"" Monster from your deck. Now you can go into Accesscode Talker and target Ningirsu in grave to gain 3000 Atk and just blow up the opponent's board maybe even end the game then &amp; there.  The reason, why Foolish Burial Goods is at 3 copies is that all Sky Striker spells, Metalfoes fusion, Machina Overdrive and after siding also World Dino Wrestling are good targets to mill and gain beneficial effects. You can also cut it to 1 and play more copies of Pot of Desires, of course, but i just hate playing the card (while loving the +1). In my opinion Mystical Space Typhoon is the best backrow removal for the deck (besides Harpie's Feather Duster and Cosmic Cyclone). Before you turn off, let me explain: It's actually pretty solid because it's 1 for 1 and often you dont need to remove so many of the opponents backrow to have a chance to play with this deck. The discard of Twin-Twister is too much of a card loss, since engage is banned and you often need the ressources. Lightning Storm is only good going 2nd but the deck is good going 2nd anyways and everybody knows that so most players will make you go 1st if they can. Going 1st is the biggest problem of Sky Strikers (besides outing Towers) and this deck build ensures that even Going 1st you can still disrupt your opponent and generate card advantage. Going 1st mystical space typhoon does the same as going 2nd and that's what's important. The advantage of Mystical Space Typhoon over Cosmic Cyclone in this deck is that you can pop your own Area Zero to special summon a Sky Striker monster from your deck if you really need it, so it actually makes your engine <strong>more consistent</strong>, which is important, because the engage-ban was a HUGE consistency hit for the deck. Depending on the match-up you can of course side the Cosmic Cyclones.  One very big flaw of the Sky Striker cards is that most of them either <strong>destroy </strong>or <strong>target</strong>. In this version of the deck you play cards like Ningirsu (non-targetting send) and also Roze (non-targetting negate). In terms of non-targetting destruction you have Citadel, Accesscode and also cards like Jamming Waves. Also Nibiru helps clearing your opponents board if they overextend, of course. So in this deck, you pretty much have answers to all cards your opponent might play.  Instead of Impermanence you can also play Forbidden Chalice, as its a spell and call also be used going 2nd if you already control a monster so it doesnt limit you the way Impermanence does (it only really makes a difference if you face a monster like Zexal &amp; VFD, because they can play around Impermanence but not as easily around Chalice - except Virtual World). Then again, Impermanence is a hand trap and chalice isn't, so I guess it is up to your preference.  In the side deck there are cards for both going 1st &amp; 2nd, which you can use depending on the match-up. I just remembered that I like to side Kaijus in the deck so that would be a change i would make in the list (good removal).  I hope I explained the theory behind this build properly. It's really fun and I win many games against competitive decks like Zoodiac, Dogmatika Invoked, Dinos, and so on. Maybe I can even motivate people to try this version of the deck. If I change the deck list I will upload the new version but until now I've been very happy with the deck.  &nbsp;"

I run Quaking Mirror Force because it's good against Zoodiac and Dinossaur;  2. The reason why I don't main Village of the Spellcasters is because the format don't have spell based decks and Majespecter can't spam turn 1 consistently, that means the opponent will only try to attack your spellcaster before resolving their spells;  3. This format is a control format, don't need a lot of handtraps like the last format, that's the reason why I just run 3 ashes, gamma is dead on this deck, but you can side deck it if you want;  4. DO NOT SWAP Desires for Extravagance. This deck needs their extra deck toolboxes when the fuel on the main deck ends. When Blazing Vortex arrives, you may consider Pot of Disparity;  5. This deck have bad matchups against non targetable Monsters and floodgates. You need to consider this if you're thinking in modifying this build;  6. The reason why I run a single copy of the Magistus Aleister is because he's a name for Ties and Majesty, since he can change it's own attribute for wind, and can be revived from the GY for selene target after.  &nbsp;"

It is a combo deck that is all about setting up a big board of monsters while also having back row cards to reassure that you wont die either when your monsters are destroyed or they have found a way to negate your entire board(cards like dark ruler no more, forbidden droplet etc.). This deck unfortunately is very  expensive and is not a breeze to play due to the fact that you need to be mindful of what you are doing otherwise you are doomed  explaining the combo  there are many ways to combo with phantom knights BA due to their plethora amounts of extenders and choices you can do  extender cards are: psychic wheelder, kagemucha knight, emergency teleport(to bring out wheelder),tour guide from the underworld(bring out a free material to set up your plays), danger monsters (since they are level 3 and can special summon from the hand for free)and finally phantom knights of silent boots( free special summon from hand if you control a phantom knight monster.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  one combo for example is tour guide and kagemucha knight  &nbsp;  normal summon the tour guide from hand, activate the eff of tour guide then chain kagemucha knight special summoning itself, summon a graff from the deck  link away tour guide or kagemucha knight and graff to summon a cherubini from the extra  use graff eff from gy to summon a cir from the deck  use cherubini eff to send a gloves from deck to GY  use gloves eff to send a tear scale from deck to GY  link away cherubini and cir to summon rusty knights from the extra  cir effect will activate to summon a cherubini from the gy(dont summon it to where rusty is pointing at)  use rusty eff to send a cloak from deck to gy and set a blade  use cloak eff to add a silent boot from deck to hand  tear scale will activate summoning itself from gy  special summon boots from hand  xyz summon both of them into a leviair  detach boots to summon a gloves from the banish zone  link away leviair and gloves into a anaconda  boots effect to banish itself and add a blade  anaconda eff to send red eyes fusion and summon a dragoon  then you can either set the blade or keep it in hand for next turn  with two cards you just set up three negates and a board removal  if the blades go to the gy you can use them to revive any phantom knights from your gy then if you still have scale from gy you can summon it as well so you can go into an xyz for next turn  this isnt the only combo there is in PK BA there are multiples you can do and this deck can go through many negates"

I'm not too sure on Charmers with what their game plan should be or ratios so this is more so a rough draft, any help would be appreciated.  Their main synergy comes with their large variety of attributes, although they do clash a little with the normal summon, but not enough to justify not running them. Also, this takes a lot of cards from the structure deck but also uses a lot of cards from outside sources. <span>Deck guide </span>1x Aussa- I opted to only run 1 because it doesn't do that much shit (it's gained effect is miniscule at best), but Aussa's partner is at 3, so it might be better to bump her up? Not sure. But yeah Aussa's there. 2x Dharc- Dharc , I opted to run at 2 because it actually has a pretty good first effect on SS. It searches out level 3 or 4 spellcasters, which is a ton of the deck. Although, you can only really SS Dharc with 2 Dharcs or 1 of itself and an Aleister, so it's a bit of a pain. But worth it. Also I couldn't figure out which card his partner is so help on that would be appreciated. 1x Eria- Same as Aussa, although I couldn't figure out the name of her partner (What even is it's name?) 1x Hiita- See above, except I did remember the name of her partner. It's in the deck 2x Lyna- Lyna is a solid searcher in the deck, as she gets a search of any Spellcaster with 1500 def (With is all the Charmers) on proper SS. Although I dunno the name of her partner so any help on that would be appreciated lmfao. 1x Wynn- Wynn is, not super useful as her SS effect is useless. She doesn't do much. 2x Inari - Inari is the familiar of Hiita, and is quite solid as it SS's itself as long as you control a spellcaster. It can help swarm the field, although you can only control 1. Generally a solid card and enables a SS of Hiita. It also SS's itself after it's destroyed, so that's nice. 1x Greater Inari- Greater Inari is basically the evolved form of Inari, as it allows you to send Hiita and another Hiita or Inari to special summon it from the hand or deck. Being able to summon it from the deck is fantastic, and very rare. It also has a solid effect to deal burn damage equal to the attack of 1 monster the opponent controls on summon, which can deal 3000-4000 on average. And, when it's removed from the field to the grave, it searches a possessed card, which is really nice to search for later plays. 3x Eater- Eater works similarly to Inari, as it special summons itself with the same restrictions. Although, it's graveyard effect is much better and much less situational than Inari's. During the opponent's end phase, as long as Eater is in the grave, you can pop one of your own monsters to special Eater. This is great, as it props Nefasiour's search (which i'll explain in a moment) and allows you to recur resources. 1x Nefaiserour- I have no idea how to spell it's name, but. Send a generic spellcaster and a Earth and you got the nefarious man. It's not very hard to get out due to the large amount of Eater's and Spellcasters in the deck. Nefaiseror is best to send Eater off of, because then you can SS Nefaisiour from deck and special summon the spellcaster you used for it's summon (you want to keep Eater in the grave). Then after you do your plays and it's the opponent's end phase, you can pop Nefaisioer with Eater to get the search and special Eater so you stay equal in card advantage and are ready to do more plays on your next turn. 3x Aleister- Aleister is one of the key components of the Invocation engine, and quite an interesting card. You can normal summon him to search, but in all actuality you don't always have to normal summon him as long as you have an Invocation in hand.  So he serves as fodder for tons of Invocations and synergizes quite well with the Charmer's, as he's a Spellcaster. He also is technically a hand trap, as he can boost a fusion's attack by 1000 by discarding him, which is fairly nice to beat over problem monsters (but rarely used). 3x Ghost Ogre- Ghost Ogre is much needed monster removal in the deck, as if your opponent tries any funny business you get to pop the funny business monster. While Ogre doesn't negate, it still can out annoying stuff like Borrelsword, Charles, etc. 3x Effect Veiler- The last hand trap, Effect Veiler is just a nice piece of interruption as he stops the opponent from doing much of anything, due to how important monster effects are nowadays. 3x Grand Spirit Art- Ichirin allows you to negate monster effects as long as you (basically) control a Charmer, which is a great effect, although it's a once per turn. It also allows you to reveal a spellcaster to add a monster with 1500 attack and 200 def (AKA one of the familiars) to the hand and shuffle back the revealed monster. The second effect is quite nice for helping to unclog bricked hands. For Ichirin, you want to activate Meltdown first to get it's search/bait out Ash blossoms, then replace the Meltdown with an Ichirin after you do your fusions. 3x Awakening of the Posessed- Awakening of the Possesed gives an attack boost for your monsters as long as you have a good amount of varied attributes (which you should have in this deck), and gives the Charmer's effect destruction protection. And, if you normal/special a Charmer, you can draw 1 card (although it's a hard once per turn). Awakening is great, as it makes up for some of the faults of the Charmers. 3x Master of the Spiritual Arts- the deck's main searcher, Master enables you to search a monster and a backrow, just at the cost of discarding one. The effect is generally solid and helps to get you to your combo pieces, as well as enabling plays. 3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the Invoked combo pieces, being searched by Aleister. It reaches into literally everything; the hand, graveyard, and field. It also reaches into the opponent's grave, which is fucking fantastic. All this leads into an array of fusions you can go into, all without a hard once per turn. You can also recycle Invocation and Aleister. 3x Magical Meltdown- Meltdown searches Aleister on activation, filling in the gaps of your hand for more fusion plays. It also gives more protection to your fusions on their summons, so they can't be negated. You'll want to activate Meltdown and then, after the search and fuses, replace it with Ichirin (thank god Konami let us do that, they did something smart for once). 2x Unpossed- Unpossesed gives your monsters an attack boost, battle protection, and a field swarming ability to special summon from the deck if they destroy a monster with a different attribute from the monster in the deck they're trying to SS. Unpossessed is generally fantastic, it's just a shame it's so slow, which is why it's at 2 instead of 3. <span>The extra deck <span>1x Borrelsword- Borrelsword is something you can go into sometimes, although not a ton. Don't rely  on it, but it can be a nice surprise for the opponent. </span></span>All 4 of the charmer links- They all do the same thing, so i'm not going to do them all seperately. In certain matchups they can be really helpful to summon them and steal a strong monster from the opponent's grave.  1x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.  1x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which is possible with the draw power of and searching of this deck. You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.  2x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.  2x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.  1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there.  2x Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it.  2x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks. Since a lot of the Charmer's have more useless  effects or on summon effects, Caliga's floodgate doesn't hurt us as much as it hurts the opponent in the long run. 1x Utopia- Utopia can be pretty easily overlayed into with a Charmer and their Familiar, although he himself isn't of much use. Rank it into Lightning. 1x Lightning. Lightning is the main out to a lot of problem cards, as after ranking into it from regular Utopia, it can detach materials and go up to 5000 and beat over basically anything. Lightning is really solid in this deck for spot removal, which it can struggle with. <span>Playing guide <span>The deck, isn't super complex or anything. You'll want to activate Meltdown, get your search, and then activate Invocation to fuse away Aleister or normal summon Aleister for his search, to then fuse. You'll want to get out as big of Invokeds as you can, maybe a Mechaba or something for negates, and then go through your Charmer plays (hopefully with your normal summon still available). Like normal, you'll replace Meltdown, search until you have the proper hand, and then  get out the Charmer you want. Then get out the Familar's you need and afterwards, simply play the grind game and wittle down the opponent. </span></span>This deck is a bit of a rough draft, so any help would be appreciated. A tech idea I came up with while working on this is to include a small Danger! engine, to give more fodder for Dharc and to get more monsters on the field, and for a small bit of draw power.  Update: Added in Knowledge and There Can Only Be On, also also Artemis.  There Can Only Be One cripples tons of plays from the opponent, and Knowledge is a nice draw spell. With Artemis, you can normal Aleister, search Invocation, and link off Aleister into Artemis. Then tribute Artemis for the draw of Knowledge, and afterwards, activate Invocation to banish Artemis and Aleister for a Mechaba."

Here’s the overall strategy with this deck: you first need a way to get spell counters on board, as this will lead you to a desirable outcome whether that will be OTK or 6-8 negates on turn one.  If you are wondering the best way to get to those boards, it really just depends on the hand you get. Sometimes it good enough, sometimes it’s barely serviceable, and a lot of times it gives you way more to go off of.  Anyways, Servant is gonna be your primary play maker, SS one of your negates (Jackal or Endymion), link them off into Crowley or Day-Breaker, again, depending on the hand. The Spellbooks are gonna help you a lot with thinning the deck to get to your negates or materials, as well as the Mythical Beasts being a way to get more spell counters on board.  Crowley into Secrets or Spellbook Magician of Prophecy, then go into Knowledge for draw power. Your next move is gonna have to be a way to link off without the need of a pendulum summon. If you have Pot of Desires, Pendulum Call, Duelist Alliance, Spell Power Mastery, Or Allure of Darkness, or any combination of them, go ahead and do your searches and draws to get Magister of Endymion, activate Magister, get Servant, then link off into Selene, use her effect to get Spellbook Magician, then link them off into Apollousa with 2-3 negates. Now is the time to pendulum summon. You can easily get 6-8 negates on board turn one, or manage to get 8000+ damage on board going second if you summon Avramax."

I have been playing with this deck for awhile now and it is very consistent. ,Cyber Dragon Infinity will be your main boss monster. You will be able to attach one of your opponents attack position monsters as material to Infinity once per turn and you can detach materials to negate once per turn. A great combo with this deck is Cyber Dragon Sieger and Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Sieger can boost Rampage Dragons attack by 2100 and you can use Rampage Dragon's effect to attack two extra times.

I added as many extenders as possible to continue your plays after Shiranui Solitaire or Uni-Zombie got hit by hand-traps since one of the main downsides compared to other combo decks is its vulnerability to negating your first normal summon/first send to graveyard effect. Its big strength is the possibility to get some kind of a board with almost any hand, always having some sort of control style with zombie world and Balerdroch and having insane follow up plays after turn 1 thanks to burial from a different dimension and zombie master/Goblinzombie/Mezuki cycling. Furthermore, you can easily side into using super poly and Rivalry because this deck keeps its capability to get Balerdroch and Zombieworld onto the board even with siding out a lot of the combo pieces and extenders."

Let me tell you s story of someone who fell into madness over cardboard, and the deck that was his demise. I started this list a couple of months ago as a joke, after man attempts to make it work I couldn't do it, so I did the sane thing and dropped it, however over the next months this became an obsession.  The list you see is the fruit of my labor, my pain, and my suffering.  The Isolde starters: first you run a bunch of warrior that special summon themselves to make Isolde, this part is entirely up to one's preference  Equip spells: run 1x phoenix blade, 4x others with different names, and 3x D.D.R.  The combo pieces: 1x Armageddon knight, 1x plaguespreader zombie, 1x red rose dragon, 1x white rose dragon, 1x zephyros, 2x s'monk, 1x rescue ferret, 1x vylon cube, 1x tuningware, 1x magicat, 1x de-synchro, 1x Hungry Burger, 1x catapult turtle, 1x Hamburger recipe, 3x limiter removal, 1x temple of kings, 1x DNA surgery  The Extra: 1x Isolde, 1x Halq, 1x power tool, 1x   Dugares, 1x n'tss, 1x<span> Alembertian</span>, 1x Draco Masters, 1x Armory Arm, 1x linkross, 1x hyper lib, 1x any level 6 spellcaster synchro, 1x skull dread, and 3x Nyarla because it's funny  the combo is just isolde loops, you can figure out how it works, in essence you draw the entire deck and then kill you opponent with Hungry Burger  &nbsp;"

""play pendulum and you can’t be beaten""  -Zeekou  &nbsp;  ""when in doubt, just play pend""  -henrystick  &nbsp;  Words of wisdom (in the comments section of a Zoodiac Dogmatika deck, but I digress) that inspired me to post my Pendulum list. The ban list did <strong>nothing</strong>.  Now let me explain why I chose Pendulum Magicians. As of the moment, there is only one other Pendulum archetype worth playing: Endymion. You could even mix the 2. So why don't I play Endymion? <ul>  	<li>Have you read Misc?</li> </ul> Now, imagine a card, just like Misc, but has over twice the card text. Now imagine if there was an entire archetype with card texts that long. Yeah, that's Endymion. Combine it with all playerbase's semi-illiteracy, and you've got a mess in your hands. Here, just look at this: <a data-name=""Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic"">Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</a>. Children's card game by the way. Just wanted to point that out.  Endymion Player: ""I activate Servant of Endymion, removing 3 spell counters""  Opponent: ""Cool, what does that do?""  Endymion Player: ""It lets me... (Proceeds to explain effect as Opponent sits there regretting asking the question) ... and 1 monster from my Deck""  Opponent: ""Ash""  Endymion Player: *Sigh* ""Yeah that works""  A scenario like that will be happening for the entirety of the duel as if an opponent refuses to read their own cards, how could you expect them to read Endymion? They will sit there listening for exactly the words they want (in this case ""deck"") or just interrupt their opponent saying ""Yeah never mind, I believe you."" <ul>  	<li>BIG BRAIN</li> </ul> When playing Endymion, one does not simply activate <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>. You need to think ""Oh, I should set scales first!"" And then, ""Wait, which scale do I put down first?"" And then, ""Should I use <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> before I set scales, play my field spell, then set scales? Or should I set scales, then search? Or should I search, play scales, then put down my field spell?"" And I could go on and on. it just becomes this mumbo-jumbo of decisions, and even if you decide on a play and start committing to it, you may have to change it midway due to your opponent's pieces of interaction (hand traps and such) or your own random draws off the top (desires, upstart, you get the idea). Combine that with the fact that I still misplay with some of my favorite decks, decks that I've been playing for years, and I will without a doubt butcher the entire game plan and get a tenth of the expected win rate.  So yeah, this is just my Pendulum Magicians list, nothing special, please give me your suggestions in the comments. oh yeah, the side deck are just a bunch of ideas, don't use it as an actual side deck.  Oh yeah, in case you were interested, or just wanted to say something about Pendulum, here's my Zoodiac Dogmatika list: https://ygoprodeck.com/zoodiac-dogmatika-2/  Still waiting Konaim to bring back Pend stuff."
