</strong></span>I am not going to give a comprehensive way to play the deck (I am braindead) but there will be a couple notes and questions I feel I may need to answer here</span>

<span><strong>1: </strong>We do not play the searchers like wynn the wind channeler or speedroid scratch why is that? you may ask, our opponent has always drawn ash and we would rather have extenders to try and save our play than go -2</span>

<span><strong>2: W</strong>ow your ratios of handtraps are weird? you also may ask, yes they are I don't own all the cards I wish and this is my irl deck for locals so go crazy with changing my bad handtraps and such for whatever is needed for your matchups at your own locals and such, same with the sidedeck</span>

<span><strong>3: </strong>Primitive butterfly and wandering gryphon rider are interchangable, gryphon rider is however a two card baronne with any level 3 tuner, and we are deathly scared of nibiru, personally I end up using butterfly more just for it's versatility but do whatever makes you comfortable</span>

<span><strong>4:</strong> Also ultrahound is an amazing young man please be kind to him, any opener with him is a free dump dupligate into RB shooter, use his power wisely</span>

<span><strong>5:</strong> ""Sychro summoning this much makes my head hurt"" me too buddy, me too</span>

Got a little too Jaden Yuki, but the pile is pretty good. I have easy access to the whole extra deck and plays for days. HERO feels pretty good in a world with Phoenix Enforcer, Isolde, and Anaconda. If you do a little thinking you can access almost any Boss Monster in the deck from most hands, and at this point there are some beasties.

The deck is based off of the Exodia deck that Dzeef has on his channel and an old reversal quiz ftk that I can't find anymore. The goal is to get down to 2000 or 1000 lp through chicken game, map, and popperup, then reversal quiz with set shurikens.

I've tested a few builds and this seems to be the most consistent but you still brick occasionally.

You lose to an ash vs a bad hand, veiler, imperm, and going second vs most decks. You deserve this. Thankfully these aren't really problems in the Xyz Event since everyone is playing self-ftk and numeron otk.

Please don't take this to ranked, just play the Exodia version."

His deck was insanely cheap, and I was happy to see a list to use that is extremely easy to build in cardboard, but I did imagine the $12 price tag was really strong, but the deck could be stronger. So using a comment under the video, I implemented Naturia Beast, Fabled Unicore, Rescue Cat, and a Hop Ear Squadron Engine. With that, I thought that with how many tuners and synchro monsters that were already in the deck, I decided that leaning more into it with being able to Synchro on your opponent's turn and disrupt their turn using Crystron Quandax, Desert Locusts, and a choice between Psy-Framelord Omega or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. With this, you still get all the interruption of the Melffys, with the pops from Kalantosa, and potentially some bounces and negates using Melffy Time and Melffy of the Forests. Not only that, when your board can get clogged with spare monsters, you can pull out the Plasma and lock down your opponent, and send them packing.

&nbsp;

Even with all this, the deck increased in price so much compared to the starting canvas i was provided, but I believe it's still entirely budget, gives people a fun deck, and stays cute, making it a great entry into Yu-Gi-Oh! for many."

Extra deck isn't very important. Just fodder for Extravagence. Only cards that matter are Blue eyes Ultimate Dragon For fists of the unrivaled Tenyi, Stardust Dragon for Starlight Road and LANphorhynchus if you need to get rid of a kaiju for a vanilla monster.

*Missing extra Deck card is Evolzar Dolkka"

You lose to dark ruler, and forbidden droplet but deck is fun, I l","Spyrals have been my favorite deck for as long as its been around. I have tried to keep it viable and this is my 2022 list.

Few glaring issues....

&nbsp;

46 card deck and 2 absolute dead cards, 5 undesirable starting cards:

Spyral sleeper, Last Resort, Scrap Golem, Crystron Rosenix, and Codebreaker.

&nbsp;

First off the deck is categorized according to Patrick Hoban's Road of the King card categories. So we start with the....Starters. Spyrals lose to handtraps, hard so scrap package is the best way to either bait out hand traps or establish apollousa before double helix hits the field. This also helps get around nibiru. 6 copies split among fossil dig, raptor and scrap recycler. I prefer to dig so having fossil dig helps bait ash, raptor baits imperm and effect veiler and then recycler starts the combo. Raptor also getting its effects negated keeps it on the field to help establish naturia beast with quik fix. Drones is other starter in the deck, its the other normal summon and gets you information.

Extenders are the spyral agent as recycler gets you apollousa and a spyral on field so spyral agent gets you to double helix, but rescue or assault as the spell/trap to pop off scrap package is probably the best start.

Worst part of this deck is the bricking. its a going first so for defense I want to run dragged down to the grave to rip hand traps but also draw cards off it (crossout or called by doesnt get you there). Instant fusion gives you a monster negate and a level one for where arf thou, and called by is called by. Triple tactics can be draw off sylvan xyz later in combo and if you baited out a hand trap its a free draw two or steal a body to combo with.

&nbsp;

Ultimate goal is spyral sleeper, tri-gate, apollousa as your points of interaction. You lose to dark ruler, and forbidden droplet but deck is fun, I love the archetype and probably wont ever stop playing going first spyrals.

Not optimized yet.,"This deck is based around using Princess Cologne combined with either Grandpa Demetto or Doll House to get XYZ monsters out.

Soul Tiger and Phantom Gryphon could be swapped for other Normal monsters, but you should use level 4 Normal monsters with either 0 Atk or 0 Def.

The 6 Doll Monster cards are required for Doll Happiness to work.

Box of Friends is basically required before you can Princess Cologne on the field in an effective way.  This is easiest with Doll Happiness, but setting Box and letting it be destroyed works otherwise.

Grandpa Demetto, if you already have one Normal monster in the GY and Princess Cologne has at least one material, allows you to SS any rank 8 XYZ from the Extra deck, depending on what you need at the time.

Fortune Fairy Hikari is an additional way to get Demetto out.  There may be a better replacement that doesn't clog your hand if drawn as a starting card.

Doll House allows you to get out rank 6 XYZs, but with the requirement of having 2 Normal monsters in the GY that also have a copy still in the deck.  Use Pot/Jar of Avarice if there are too many in the GY and none in the deck to make this happen.

Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness can be special summoned when Grandpa Demetto is on the field, and once it goes to the GY can destroy your other monsters to come back from the GY, proccing Supply Squad, proccing Box of Friends, or just getting rid of a monster you don't need anymore, such as certain XYZ monsters that are out of materials.

Supply Squad and Piercing the Darkness provide additional card draws, and Piercing the Darkness additionally buffs any XYZ monster that used Normal monsters as materials for summoning.  Pairs very nicely with Kachi Kochi Dragon.

Solemn and Ash Blossom probably shouldn't need explained.

Number 97: Draglubion could be easily swapped for a different XYZ but I highly recommend the others, especially Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis, which combos with Grandpa Demetto (who will usually be on the field if Hieratic is out, since you need Demetto to create the level 8 materials)."

I think I'd have to go with Sister Mary Phoenix Enforcer,"<strong><em><span>Missionary Brief</span></em></strong>

<span>This is a fun, mid-range, rogue deck that pivots between the Exosister Xyz monsters to build advantage and search on your turn and create adaptable and powerful disruption on your opponent's. The DPE package is used to wear down opponents' resources and provide added disruption. Standard turn 1 involves going into one or two Xyz to search for Exosister spell and traps, protected by Lord of the Heavenly Sky Prison. </span>

<span><i>The Sisters </i></span>

<span>The Exosister main deck monsters are devoted to a life of chastity and modesty by which I mean they don't do very much. Bar their quick-Xyz effects they each have either mild swarming abilities or even milder card advantage effects. Elis is by far the most versatile, Sophia is the best to have on board for the free draw and Stella is useful enough, essential three ofs, if just for the names. I'm sure Irene's a lovely gal but her cycle effect is by far the least useful since usually you want to be seeing the Exosister cards in hand, still an important one of for Vadis and Pax.</span>

<span>The Exosister extra deck monsters are really where the deck gets to shine providing a wide range of highly useful and relevant effects to stop each of your opponents plays. When Exosister Magnifica arrives with Dimension Force it will be a welcome addition for its high impact and OTK enabling ability. Arment, Pax and Vadis are all fantastic suporting cards to help you build resources on your turn and enable Xyz plays. Carpedivem is a really interesting and versatile support spell that can be used to play around cards like Ash and Nibiru but also turn off floodgates like Skill Drain and Mystic Mine.</span>

<span><strong><em>Rank 4 Extenders</em></strong></span>

<span> I've come to learn that rank 4 extenders in Yugioh are pretty much a game of pick your poison. Dynatherium is close enough the only completely ""free"" extender for the deck providing at worst a free body and at best providing some quick xyz upgrades for your nuns to punish any opponents on the side of the player base that don't value reading. </span>

<span>The deck is built with as few bricks as possible to try and offset the fact the deck struggles to built up card advantage on turn one. The risk of opening double Parallel eXceed however is easily offset by the amount of advantage it can get you (extending from the deck is really good, who knew?!) All your sisters are potencial Almiraj material to get into eXceed plays and even if it gets ashed, you're left with all you need to Anaconda into DPE on exactly your 5th summon. </span>

<span>Shade Brigandine is always live turn one and that's when you'll need it most. Even if you have to set it, it at least often has LOTHP protection. </span>

<span><strong><em>Friends of the Convent</em></strong> </span>

<span>Lord Of The Heavenly Prison really is an MVP of the deck. He lets you set multiple backrow turn 1 without worrying about falling foul of a feather duster and allows you to search powerful follow traps for your next, often Vadis or Judgment. He's easily searchable by Gallant Granite who can then be used to make Utopic Draco Future with one of your Sisters or linked off for Anaconda.</span>

<span>Called by the Grave and Triple Tac help you play through hand traps and Xyz Reborn gives some recovery otherwise lacking from the deck. Triple Imperm because it's great going first or second and IMO the best hand trap in the game at the moment.</span>

<span>F0 and Zeus because they're F0 and Zeus and Gagaga Magician to help facilitate some F0 plays.</span>

<em><strong><span>STRENGTHS</span></strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li><span>It's fun, unique and like any decent rogue option puts an opponent who doesn't know how it plays on the back foot.</span></li>
 	<li><span>In the right hands it is incredibly versatile and able to adjust and target disruption on the fly.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Good, new support on its way.</span></li>
 	<li><span>While it doesn't synergise enough to warrant playing, its generally quite comfortable playing through banish cards like Macro Cosmos</span></li>
</ul>
<span><em><strong>WEAKNESSES + PROBLEM CARDS</strong></em></span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>It's a difficult deck to play. While the cards for the most part function pretty simply there's very few easy wins with this one, one wrong move can lose you a game. Knowing how your opponent's deck and cards work is vitally important in order to target your disruption.</span></li>
 	<li><span>The recovery for the deck is really low. If you burn through all your main or extra deck Exosisters you'll be lying high and dry.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Going second</span></li>
 	<li><span>It's expensive. These days you can build some pretty meta-competant decks on a budget, this is neither.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Ash Blossom, Nibiru, There Can Be Only One and Cosmic Cyclone all have the potencial to throw your game plan off big time. Unless you side in Ice Dragon's Prison, it really struggles to get over Dragoon too.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span>Constructive feedback and good side deck options always appreciated!</span>"

The Phantasm Spiral archetype is underrated. Although non-meta, this deck has a lot of power. It's focused on control and resummoning your boss monster  - the ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"". The strategy goes like this:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing your field spell - ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing ""<em>Megalosmasher X</em>"" with ""<em>Fossil Dig</em>"" and/or using a token from ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> your Phantasm Spiral spells and/or traps with ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"" (when you normal summon), based on the appropriate situation:
- traps and ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"", when you're cornered;
- spells (excluding ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"") to destroy monsters and/or do damage and to summon ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>negating effects</strong> (including <strong>negating effects</strong> that <strong>negate and/or destroy your spells and/or traps</strong>) using:
- ""<em>Skill Drain</em>"";
- ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Power</em>"";
- ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"";
- ""Sea Stealth Attack"" (1st effect);
- ""<em>Called by the Grave</em>"" (side deck);
- ""<em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>negating attacks</strong> and <strong>destroying/returning</strong><em> to the hand</em> monsters using:
- ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Battle</em>"";
- ""<em>Raigeki</em>"";
- ""<em>Storming Mirror Force</em>"";
- ""<em>Sea Stealth Attack</em>"" (2nd effect);</li>
 	<li> and <strong>getting the needed cards</strong> with:
- ""<em>Pot of Duality</em>""
- ""<em>Pot of Extravagance</em>"".</li>
</ul>
If your opponent tries to destroy your ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"" do NOT stop him because if its card is destroyed WHILE set, you can special summon from your Extra Deck ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"" which is <strong>the strongest monster</strong> (in terms of ATK and DEF) <strong>in the deck</strong>. Also, you should rarely use the Extra Deck except if there's a <strong>problematic spell and/or trap card/s on your opponent's field</strong> and you don't think that you aren't going to draw cards to negate these effects, THEN you should summon ""<em>Knightmare Phoenix</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters with different names on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>"") and if you've run out of those - ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>""). And if it's your turn, your opponent has a problematic monster, you have 3 monsters on your field (you can also use the effect of Link Spider if you don't have a total of 3 monsters on your field in which case you'll need AT LEAST 1 on your field), turn 2 of them into ""<em>Link Spiders</em>"", then play ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" so that it points to one of your monsters which you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has. Use the effect of ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" AND destroy the monster you gave to your opponent. If you think that ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" won't point to one of your monsters that you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has, THEN DO NOT summon it.

This singular version is optimized to play against Maxx C and Ash Blossom. (2 Gamma's. 2 Called and 3 Ash) and maintaining the light attribute spots for Chaos Ruler.

Gamma works well even playing 1st due to Crimson Resonator and Inca package (Dawnwalker and Duskwalker) being a hand trigger effect. If your opp triggers maxx c to crimson resonator and you gamma it you will gain a free chaos ruler + light monsters on grave as extenders.

&nbsp;

A particular add on this deck was Red familiar. I used to play Witch of black forest, she's good, but only works on field. Red familiar can work as a discard, you can tribute it from field sometimes to get a synchro used from grave and the main reason: from grave you can banish it and module your synchro levels to start your plays from bottom again. One of this deck issues was the fact that it will have follow up from grave, but if you don't draw a non-tuner top deck you can't use de rest of your lvl 6's from extra deck properly.

&nbsp;

that's it. hope you guys enjoy :)

The Phantasm Spiral archetype is underrated. Although non-meta, this deck has a lot of power. It's focused on control and resummoning your boss monster  - the ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"". The strategy goes like this:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing your field spell - ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> and/or playing ""<em>Megalosmasher X</em>"" with ""<em>Unexpected Dai</em>"" and/or using a token from ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>searching out</strong> your Phantasm Spiral spells and/or traps with ""<em>Pacifis, the Phantasm City</em>"" (when you normal summon), based on the appropriate situation:
- traps and ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"", when you're cornered;
- spells (excluding ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Wave</em>"") to destroy monsters and/or do damage and to summon ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Dragon</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>negating effects</strong> (including <strong>negating effects</strong> that <strong>negate and/or destroy your spells and/or traps</strong>) using:
- ""<em>Soul Drain</em>"";
- ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Power</em>"";
- ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"";
- ""Sea Stealth Attack"" (1st effect);
- ""<em>Called by the Grave</em>"";</li>
 	<li><strong>negating attacks</strong> and <strong>destroying/returning</strong><em> to the hand</em> monsters using:
- ""<em>Phantasm Spiral Battle</em>"";
- ""<em>Raigeki</em>"";
- ""<em>Storming Mirror Force</em>"";
- ""<em>Sea Stealth Attack</em>"" (2nd effect);</li>
 	<li> and <strong>getting the needed cards</strong> with ""<em>Pot of Duality</em>"".</li>
</ul>
If your opponent tries to destroy your ""<em>Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</em>"" do NOT stop him because if the aforementioned card is destroyed WHILE set, you can special summon from your Extra Deck ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"" which is <strong>the strongest monster</strong> (in terms of ATK and DEF) <strong>in the deck</strong>. Also, you should rarely use the Extra Deck except if there's a <strong>problematic spell and/or trap card/s on your opponent's field</strong> and you don't think that you aren't going to draw cards to negate these effects, THEN you should summon ""<em>Knightmare Phoenix</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters with different names on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>"") and if you've run out of those - ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" (if you don't have the needed amount of monsters on your field use ""<em>Link Spider</em>""). And if it's your turn, your opponent has a problematic monster, you have 3 monsters on your field (you can also use the effect of Link Spider if you don't have a total of 3 monsters on your field in which case you'll need AT LEAST 1 on your field), turn 2 of them into ""<em>Link Spiders</em>"", then play ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" so that it points to one of your monsters which you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has. Use the effect of ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" AND destroy the monster you gave to your opponent. If you think that ""<em>Geonator Transverser</em>"" won't point to one of your monsters that you don't care about AND the problematic monster your opponent has, THEN DO NOT summon it.

It's a trap-based strategy that functionally turns into a combo-deck by the end of turn 4. But time has not been kind to the archetype. Control decks like Eldlich and Dogmatika simply outpace it in a few key areas. Recoverability, pressure, compactness, there are a lot of reasons the deck can't stand up to its modern counterparts.

However, for a brief stint, I found the deck rather playable. The frog engine pairs very well with the Numeron engine. Numeron gives frogs a first turn Apollousa or Avramax to pair with your traps. It can also provide an OTK to unsuspecting opponents. Swap Frog's bounce for cost effect lets you clear the field of your normal summon, meaning you can dump a Ronintoadin and resolve a Numeron Network on the same turn. Pair that with arguably the best boss monster in Yu-Gi-Oh, the aptly named Toadally Awesome, and you have a pretty solid deck.

With ZEXAL's ban, I have had to make a few updates, but I am overall still pleased with the deck."

Karakuri recieved some new support some time ago, and I wanted to play it. But it bricked; it bricked hard. Its lines were short, except that occasional golden opportunity that would dump your entire extra deck onto the field, half your deck into your GY, and the other half into your hand. Why yes, every synchro is a Halqifibrax, but what good is that if you can't make them?

And now, we have received a gift, the extenders we not only needed, but deserved: Ready Fusion and Emergency Teleport (to 3).

These two cards solve most problems, offering a variety of ways to manipulate the levels of monsters available to unlock even the rustiest of hands."

Other combo decks could do what it did, but better: Infernoble, Drytron, Dragonlink, Virtual World. They were more consistent, not requiring the bricky rocks that built the bulk of your deck should you want to build large combo boards.

However, Adamancipator has an unexplored, and exceptionally powerful synchro: Adamancipator Risen - Leonite. This monster allows you to excavate 5 and add any Adamancipator card (monster, spell, or trap) to your hand, and, if you can get a fire into the GY, can revive a monster on your opponent's turn. Koa'ki Meiru Guardian is the obvious choice, but less obvious option is Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite, who will trigger and let you draw a card.

Add in that their field spell, Adamancipator Laputite, can stack your deck once per turn, and you can fate-seal yourself into two starters and a guaranteed excavation on your following turn, making this strategy incredibly sticky.

This deck is streamlined to do one thing: make Halq and a live Leonite, and start plusing. Handtraps form the backbone of your interactions, and we play a whopping 11 of them. Including the three Forbidden Droplets, and you have a robust package to give you a chance when going second.

If you're tired of being blown out by Dark Ruler no More, and still want to play rocks, this may be right up your alley."

But seriously this works better than it should. I know I could have cheesed with a LOT more annoying trap cards, but I've been using this in Mater duel against some friends and it's the perfect balance between shitass annoying and creative.

Anyway, quick strategy description; You want wightprince in the graveyard by any means. The most basic way of doing this is playing wightprincess and using her effect. Uni zombie also helps by discarding Wightbaking, which allows you to add wightprince and then discard him. Uni zombie ties both archetypes extremely well tbh since he can send Eldlich and any skull servant/ wight card to the graveyard pretty easily.  Anyway, you eventually use wightprince in the GY to special summon King of the skull servants and just deal a fuckton of damage.

THERE ARE REALLY EASY WAYS TO BACKFIRE. Wightprincess's 2nd effect should generally be used BEFORE you summon Eldlich otherwise you drown your attack points for no benefit.  Also, skill drain does kill King of the Skull Servants' effect so really only use it to stall while you have a Eldlich in your GY so you can get rid of skill drain manually.

Burial from a different dimension is the only thing saving yourself from getting locked when your opponent banishes your monsters, you can play around with the ratios but keeping it at 2 is safe enough for me.

The things this deck can do is insanely fun. There's a lot of cheese you can do to save yourself in the extra deck, especially if you a super unlucky hand of 3 regular skull servants and two wight princes, you can link summon and send them to the graveyard and unbrick yourself. Knightmare works really well for this.

This deck just has so many basic things going for it that's easy to understand and hard to mess up WHILE still having the adjustability of any viable deck.

You have a deck that's really hard to brick yourself, A ton of sustain through your trap cards, ways to thin out your deck to your benefit, and cards with really high attack potential (king of the skull servant)."

Clear New World is situated perfectly for ABC due to the fact destroying your own A,B, or C just plusses you, and with tuner access now allows you to make Baronne along with your normal end board.

The idea is to use the Clear New World with 2 or more ABC monsters on field to grab an Ash Blossom, make Burei to grab Ninishi, then make Baronne.

The side board shows some of my side board and other ideas, like just making Dawn Dragster, or for a budget option using Burei to grab Gama to make Crystal Wing.

I think the general idea of Clear New World is one that needs to be explored more and has a ton of potential."

Crealtar also helps with giving your impcantation cards some damage if you didn't summon them in defense AND unlocks your extra deck by negating the impcantation cards but not the ritual ones.

I would say the 5 most replaceable cards in this deck would probably have to be Raigeki, Harpie's, Solemn, Skill drain, and Return of the Dragon lords. They're really only there because of my experience with specific players, I encourage you to swap these out with stuff that suits your playstyle and or builds upon the chaos archetype.

Biggest weakness would definitely have to be the inability to clear the board or negate stuff in general, I used to have ash blossom but I think I can get away with skill drain more with more effect. I found that with most problematic cards, regular chaos dragon would just flip it and the problem was solved.

I see too many chaos max dragon profiles exclude Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon (the 3000 one) and I don't get why, its so easy to summon both and guarantee you OTK on 2nd turn if the opponent can't negate you and they have at minimum 2 monsters on the field."

That's what this is.,"First deck! ...There's not much to it, I think.

There's a few routes it could take. First step is to deal direct spell damage/healing wherever possible. Then it branches:

(1) Sack a bunch of monsters to beef up the Shadow Ghoul (Unhappy Maiden. etc.), which pairs well with the Castle of Dark Illusions/Pumpking combo (the zombie deck that could've been :&lt; ).

(2) Get the Battleguard squad growing (using Sangan and Black Forest Witch to get them to your hand if needed). If you can get the Sogen field out there, all the better.

(3) There's also a few defensive/direct damage options (Catapult Turtle, Cannon Soldier, Suijin to some extent). Pair Suijin with Ring of Magnetism for... something, idk.

Sorry for the lack of trap cards, I didn't draft any good ones :/"

So in spite of all the constant barrage of ideas of decks for this archetypes, Phantom Knights can indeed run this engine. While not the best in the world, it doesn't take much for it to get what it needs done for the sake of self doubt. In short, just play Phantom Knights how it should be played

However the only problem I haven't added for the sake of this being a demonstration deck is the addition of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> targets. Other than than, the notion of adding the Libromancer engine is to extend the link plays (if taking the Agent/Doombroker route) or going the XYZ route excluding Raider's Knight (if taking the Geek-Boy/ Firestarter Route). Destroy Phoenix Enforcer also helps in a time of need for he does things (especially Celestial for Draw 2 and Dasher for Special Summoning if you draw into a monster during the draw phase, while in the GY). As for Raider's Knight, he is there for Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon (indestructible beefcake that could DRNM all monsters on the field the turn it used it's XYZ effect)."

As per usual, cards on the main will be my personal choices based on what cards I currently have, and the cards on the side will be the tech options for you to consider.

<strong>A few questions:</strong>

• <strong>""Why Dogmatika? That seems counter intuitive since they're all about the GY set up?""</strong> - <span>This deck doesn't really care about how fast it wants to win. All it needs is to control the tempo of the game within its reach and be comfortable with that pace. If you can manage to keep that, everything else will follow. But I do admit that often times I find myself lacking necessary pressure, and the Dogmatika cards are just generally great as a supplementary engine for anything that needs that but isn't really concerned about sacrificing their Special Summons from the Extra Deck. I also did some tests with the <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and it could be fine, I guess? But for you to be able to access that, you'd need to turn your Necrovalley off first, which isn't good so I've cut it. But what I did consider is putting x3 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>s in the Extra Deck as <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> targets and including one copy of each <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a> for added utility.</span>

<strong>The game plan, and the list:</strong>

It's pretty simple.

• <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a></strong> - <span>Your boss card, not even a monster, which deals with the GY. If this card properly resolves, you pretty much win the game against most decks. I do not recall any top tier deck that doesn't make great use of the graveyard as of now, but I am damn sure they all do.</span>

• <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Royal Tribute"">Royal Tribute</a></strong> - <span>This card is what truly seals the deal, since it deals with the hand. There's a reason why <a data-name=""Confiscation"">Confiscation</a>, <a data-name=""Delinquent Duo"">Delinquent Duo</a>, and <a data-name=""The Forceful Sentry"">The Forceful Sentry</a> are all banned. If I could make a room for Monarchs, I'd even put <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a> in here, but maybe that's a list for another day to test. Phantom Knights need to banish themselves to gain effects from the GY. Drytrons activate from the GY, but tributes for cost and cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Eldlich also activates from the GY and also sends for cost. It doesn't matter.</span>

• <strong>x1 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a></strong> - <span>The one card dedicated to deal with the Extra Deck. This is probably the only list of Dogmatika that I'll use Maximus with, at least as of now, because this list isn't really concerned too much with being able to summon Extra Deck monsters.</span>

• <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, <a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a>, <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a></strong> - <span>Any of these three will do, but personally I would choose Skill Drain to deal with on field monster effects. I just want that extra consistency that Pot of Prosperity provides. The latter two for trap heavy floodgates even though we do not really care about that, except probably for <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>., also it turns off our Dogmatika Punishments and Solemn Judgments, which is bad because we need protection for <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>.</span>

• <strong>x2 <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist"">Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist</a></strong> - <span>This card is more of a win more card, which also provides itself and your Necrovalley some neat destruction protection. He's a decent beat stick, and he also searches your <a data-name=""Hidden Temples of the Necrovalley"">Hidden Temples of the Necrovalley</a>, which also is in here to deal with Special Summons in general.</span>

• <strong>x3 <a data-name=""Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley"">Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley</a></strong> - <span>It's an archetypal <a data-name=""Infernity Barrier"">Infernity Barrier</a>, despite it being a hard once per turn, it's still good to have as an added protection to be considered, although it's an SR so if you're on a budget, I don't really recommend it.</span>

Despite winning most of the time without actually needing to Fusion Summon, this still technically is a Fusion strategy so I figured I might want to share it because I love Fusion strategies in general (with a select few exceptions). So yeah, enjoy ruining Eldlich and Drytron players' lists."

This deck seeks to set up a board of negates with Borreload Savage Dragon, Joruri-P.U.N.K. Nashiwari Surprise/Joruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu, and a synchro summon on the opponent's turn into Ukiyoe P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon.

&nbsp;

How does this deck work? Well, the Adventurer Engine and Halqifibrax lines are both self explanatory, but there are some interactions that I want to point out. When using Rite of Aramesir, it locks you out of activating the abilities of normal summoned monsters for the rest of the turn. Most P.U.N.K.s have an ability you will most definitely want to use on their summon, so consider special summoning the ones you want to activate. A few ways to do this:

-Emergency Teleport, search and summon a P.U.N.K. (Ze Amin if you need monsters, Sharakusai if you have the other P.U.N.K. in hand to fusion summon with, or Wagon/Madame Spider depending if you need Spells or Traps)

-Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune can discard themselves and one card from hand to special a P.U.N.K. from deck

-Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note can send themselves from hand to grave to special a P.U.N.K. from hand

-When Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note is sent to the grave, you can special a P.U.N.K. from grave

-Lastly,  you can tribute the P.U.N.K. fusion monster (Carp Rising) to special two P.U.N.K.s from deck

&nbsp;

Keep these in mind, because we almost always want to activate Rite of Aramesir and set up the Wandering Gryphon Rider as a negate. On most of our starting turns, whether we go first or second, we want to move through the Halq line to get to Borreload Savage Dragon. That isn't hard for this deck; the tricky part is figuring out what we make alongside it.

&nbsp;

For now, I'm uploading a list in progress. I'm going to update this description and decklist over time, and any suggestions or comments you have I'm happy to incorporate. Thanks for taking the time to read this!"

Kozmo already works really well in MD  since they really don't need to dig into the extra deck to kill, they do have lots of good options with a proper rank 5 engine, though. The XYZ Fest banlist hit a lot of popular decks with non-targeting destruction, making it easier to just throw down a destroy mid-combo on your opponent and watching them struggle to get over it.... just always make sure you SS into defense mode against Utopia if you don't want to eat a game-ending swing.

Galaxy Soldier can overlay with Sliperider to go into Nova and then Infinity for an omni-negate.

Soartroopers can grab another copy of themselves or Farmgirl from grave to overlay into either a Leviair or Nightmare Shark, the latter of which can go into Zeus."

Grayewick the Fusionist here, I took a bit of a break from Master Duel and dueling in general, to an extent, just to get myself cleaned off of the tilt and salt that's been building up within me due to the terrible format that is the OCG but hey, I'm back with a deck that I've been using in the Xyz Festival right now, pure Mekk-Knights. As per usual, the cards in the side would be the ""nice to haves"" or the tech choices I personally would use.

<strong>""Why play this over Scars turbo?""</strong>

<span>Well first of all, <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> is at 1 (for some reason), so it's not gonna be as consistent, and second is I do not have the other cards to make it work and I can't fill any good fillers for the strategy because a lot has to go right to pull it off.</span>

<strong>The Strategy:</strong>

<span>So, as per usual, the strategy is simple. You build a standard Mekk-Knight list, you stun them with <a data-name=""World Legacy's Secrets"">World Legacy's Secrets</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Whispers"">World Legacy Whispers</a>, and <a data-name=""World Legacy Key"">World Legacy Key</a>, and you beat them down with your Mekk-Knights since they're all just bigger Cyber Dragons. A lot of decks in the event right now are anti-meta Barrier Statue stun or Phantasm Spirals, and this is where this deck shines. ALSO, thank God and everything in creation that Eldlich the Golden Lord is banned, I am so sick and tired of seeing that monki flip deck (even though to a small extent I am partially responsible for it because I've shared some of my list about it but I digress), it's just a deck that could be argued as ""maybe fun"" to use, but definitely not fun to play against.</span>

<strong>Discussing the list changes:</strong>

<span>The only difference between this deck and the usual Mekk-Knight build is that we don't have access to <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star"">Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</a>, <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a>, or <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, which makes the zone management a bit more challenging. But the good thing is, since it's an Xyz centered event, a lot of decks are playing the nasty floodgates such as <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> or <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, both of which we can comfortably play around and through since we play a lot of high-impact going second cards.</span>

• x3 <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a> - <span>Since we also do not have access to the Invoked package, our dedicated Normal Summon will be filled by him. He's a 2000 ATK Normal Monster, which means he can get over the Barrier Statues or <a data-name=""Banisher of the Radiance"">Banisher of the Radiance</a>/<a data-name=""Banisher of the Light"">Banisher of the Light</a>. If you wanna go really budget, that's also fantastic since you can turbo him out of the deck with the freely obtainable <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>s, but the most important thing is he's a Mekk-Knight, which means your Continuous Spells/Traps work with him.</span>

• x1 <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset"">Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset</a> - <span>This card is usually not being played in most, if not all, Mekk-Knight lists, but since we have space, we could play it just for the name, and it's a 3000 DEF wall. It's effect to Special Summon from the hand doesn't always come up, but it's always nice to have than nothing (I think).</span>

• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> - <span>The remaining 9 slots of your deck could be any combination of these four cards. I only chose Lightning Storm, Evenly Matched, and Ice Dragon's Prison because it deals better with the anti-meta stuff than Forbidden Droplet, even though clearing our opponent's board seems counter intuitive.</span>

• x3 <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> - <span>In pure Mekk-Knight variants, this deck is usually just played as either a 1 or 2 of since it's searchable, but since we do not have access to Lib the World Key Blademaster, it's safe to play it to 3, plus, it's an archetypal Emergency Teleport.</span>

• Extra Deck - <span>These are just filler cards. If you have <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, or both <a data-name=""Number 97: Draglubion"">Number 97: Draglubion</a> and <a data-name=""Number 100: Numeron Dragon"">Number 100: Numeron Dragon</a>, or any generic Rank 8 monsters that are generally good, play them.</span>

So yeah, that's pretty much it. There's really nothing much else to discuss about this deck but have fun, I guess. Until next time."

Yes, I meant to put in localized tornado since it allows you to outlast your opponent in some very specific matchups. Waking the dragon is one of the key cards in this since you can win the game off 1 of them activating alone. inspector boarder is the card that allows this deck to thrive. It shuts off handtraps, stops any combo plays, gy effects, and practically anything else."

then follow up with the exosister engine.

the exosisters can xyz with one material which protects themselves from card effects or by battle from monsters form the graveyard.

&nbsp;

normal raye or roze for the sky strikers then link into hayate if going second or shizuku if going first. shizuku search engage if going first and you don't open it but if you do open engage and your going first play engage and then search widow anchor (1st negate of the turn) normal raye/roze or play hornet drones (if you open it) then link into kagari add bac the engage to search eagle booster and set it (protection). add a second widow anchor of shizuku,

&nbsp;

for the exosister normal stella and if you have pax search either vadis or elis.

the deck can make accesscode talker turn one if you open engage, pax and instant fusion.

if you open engage and rax play engage chain pax search vadis of pax then of engage search hornet drones. set vadis and activate drones. link one into kagari add engage. activate engage to search widow anchor then set it. activate instant fusion to special summon allvain. link two into halqifibrax spec effect veiler. link 3 into selene then spec back effect veiler, link 4 into accesscode talker.

if your halqifibarax gets negated you can still play accesscode but it does take a bit longer but you can get a raye in the grave in your opponents turn with riser dragon. just because halq got negated you can still get selene out if you wait till your turn to use vadis.

when you need to side cards and your playing against a trap heavy deck take out breaktrough skill for royal decree.

sky striker used to get stopped by secret village without summoning effect veiler or selene but now with the exosisters you can play extremely well. it has been testeed against evil twin and it works really well."

Here's how to win in 1 turn with them.,"You need Urnight, Iron Core, a level 4 monster in hand OR any monster in the graveyard (to not use Bujinki Ahashima).  Or Summoner Monk, any spell card, Iron Core, a level 4 monster in hand OR any monster in the graveyard.

Simplest combo: Normal summon <strong>Urnight</strong>, Urnight reveals <strong>Iron Core</strong>, special summon <strong>Supplier</strong>, Supplier searches for <strong>Maximus</strong>, Link <strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong>, Bujinki makes <strong>Number 60</strong>, Number 60 summons <strong>Urnight</strong>, Urnight summons <strong>Guardian</strong> or Supplier, XYZ <strong>Dark Rebellion</strong>, <strong>Vespenate</strong> on top of Number 60, summon <strong>Maximus</strong>, activate Dark Rebellion, destroy a card with Maximus, attack for game.

It may sound like a lot of setup at first but it's incredibly consistent to pull off.  <strong>Summoner Monk</strong> works as a second Urnight and only needs 1 extra spell card for the same combo to happen just in a different order, plus he can leave you with Guardian on the field as well to negate a monster effect (Nibiru?).  <strong>Tin Goldfish</strong> makes use of Supplier to search for the missing piece for when you happen to draw into both or even 3 Supplier.  <strong>Small World</strong> can set you up into ANY of these hands.  <strong>Kaijus</strong> are there to get rid of omni-negates, <strong>Pankratops</strong> puts a monster in the grave (no longer need for Bujinki Ahashima) and gets rid of a card + is also bait, and <strong>Adventurer Token</strong> engine is there to create an omni-negate before you start your combo.

That's it really.  The fact that you only need 2 or 3 cards (at worst) means you can also run all these other defensive options to make sure your combo goes through. You could also run Ash Blossom, Crossout Designator, Instant Fusion, Millennium Eyes Restrict, Mudragon of the Swamp, and Cross Sheep for more protection + a different setup similar to Bujinki Ahashima using Cross Sheep and Instant Fusion."
