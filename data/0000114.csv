Negation-heavy, graveyard heavy. ","As the title suggests, this deck revolves around Endless Decay as the boss monster, and utilizes the effects of Zombie World to access the GYs (as well as slow your opponent down). Zombie World will prevent some opponents from running their decks properly, as it changes all monsters in the GYs and on the field to Zombie type. Endless Decay is works best when it is summoned early, as it's ATK is whatever your opponent's LP are, divided by 2, at the time of summon. It is especially potent in 2v2, where if summoned first turn, it has 8000 ATK. Watch out for Solemn Judgement, as a well-timed use will almost completely negate the firepower of this deck.  There are quite a few negate cards that will give you some breathing room to summon ED and the other powerful powerful monsters. Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend is especially potent and relatively simple to special summon (so long as you can keep alive at least one of its synchro materials. Always try to have Zombie World on the field. It will make a handful of summons very easy as well as mess up your opponent when they need to tribute. Red-eyes Zombie Dragon becomes more powerful with each Zombie monster on the field and in the GYs, so it can be a very reliable late-game Synchro monster it's too late to summon an Endless Decay or too difficult to summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend.  &nbsp;  A few tips:  Special summon Endless Decay as early as possible. Use Pyramid Turtle to bait opponent into attacking for a special summon from the deck of a 2000 or less DEF Zombie Monster (Endless Decay, Doomking Balerdroch). Use Mezukis and then Burial From a Different Dimension to ensure that the useful effect monsters can continue to be summoned from the graveyard. Fusion Summon Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon with SuperPoly after placing Zombie World in a field zone.  Use Tatsunecro, Glow-Up Bloom, and Jack-O-Bolan to Syncro-Summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend (when Zombie World is on the field), and wipe the field during MP1.  Negate opponent's Summons with Enma's Judgement, Doomking (during a chain) and Ash Blossom.  Use Foolish Burial to put an Endless Decay in the GY as soon as possible, then Mezuki, Monster Reborn, Book of Life, or Jack-O-Bolan to Special Summon.  Banish Necroworld Banshee to put Zombie World on the field, then use Burial From a Different Dimension to put NB back in the GY, then Special Summon it onto the field to protect Zombie World.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Note: This is my first post to ygoprodeck but I have been utilizing this deck (and older variations of it) for almost 2 years and I believe it is now fun and effective enough to share with the world."

This Deck strategy is more or less the same. However, t","<span><strong>*[EDIT: Check ""Ideal Starting Hand"" Section]</strong></span>  An update to my original ""Charming Magicians"" Deck, which seems to have gotten fairly popular. This Deck strategy is more or less the same. However, there are now 50 cards, and I got rid of some of the fluff, removing many monsters that didn't work in tandem with the ""<strong>Possessed</strong>"" Spell/Traps (<span><strong><span>Ichirin</span> <span>[F]</span></strong></span><span>,</span> <strong><span><span>Awakening</span> <span>[</span></span>∞]</strong>, &amp; <span><strong>Teamwork</strong></span>, <span><strong>Unpossessed</strong></span> <strong><span><span>[</span></span>∞]</strong>), and actually replacing them with monsters that have more combo potential with this Deck in general.  <strong><span>Changes:</span></strong>  The Deck's goal is still to try and get out <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>, and then <span><strong>⌈<span>Datascape Fox - XianXian<span>⌋</span></span></strong><span><span><span>. I ended up removing <span><strong>⌈<span>Explosive Magician<span>⌋</span></span></strong><span>, because while its effect is useful, unlike <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Arcanite Magician</span><span>⌋</span></strong>, it doesn't give itself Spell Counters upon summoning, making its effect useless if it's the only monster on the field. Plus, <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Arcanite Magician</span><span>⌋ </span></strong>is just better anyway, since you aren't limited to just Spell/Traps. I also removed <strong>⌊<span>Leviar the Sea Dragon</span>⌋</strong> and swapped it for <strong>⌈<span>Time Thief Redoer</span>⌋</strong>. I actually haven't tested this change out yet, and I may even end up switching it up again, but I found myself NEVER using <strong>⌊<span>Leviar the Sea Dragon</span>⌋</strong>, even when it may have worked. I also wanted to put in an Xyz monster that required less monsters to Special Summon, since both of the Spellcaster Xyz monsters require 3 Level 4 monsters, which can be difficult for a single turn. I ended up side-decking <span><strong>DNA Surgery</strong><span> <strong>[∞] </strong>and</span><strong><span> <span><span>Chocolate Magician Girl</span><span>.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> I also ended up removing <strong><span>Wynn the Wind Medium</span></strong><span><span>/</span></span><strong><span>Channeler</span></strong><span><span>, <span><strong>Magical Exemplar</strong></span>, <span><strong>Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane</strong></span>, and <span><strong>Dark Spirit Art - Greed</strong></span>. <span><strong>Wynn</strong></span> was occasionally useful, but any time I had the choice to Special Summon or add a Charmer to my hand, I would just end up going for the ""<strong>Familiar Possessed</strong>"" monsters. They are objectively more useful in this deck for 2 reasons. For one, they are Level 4, so they are not only easier to summon, but are much more useful for Xyz and Synchro Summoning. Second, there aren't too many WIND monsters in this Deck, so using <strong><span>Wynn</span></strong>'s effect to Summon it isn't readily useful, unless you have multiple <span><strong>Wynn the Wind Charmer</strong></span> monsters in your deck. <span><strong>Magical Exemplar</strong></span> is in a similar boat, because it can be situationally useful, but its ATK/DEF don't mesh with the deck well. I got rid of <span><strong>Spritual Earth Art</strong></span> because <span><strong>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</strong></span> has basically the same effect, but it Destroys the monster instead of Tributing it, so it can activate <strong><span>Unpossessed</span></strong>'s <strong>[∞]</strong> effect with little cost. I got rid of <span><strong>Greed</strong></span> because it is SUPER risky to use since most decks run on Spells, whereas Traps are much rarer. Finally, I added <span><strong>Fairy Tail - Luna</strong></span>, <strong><span>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</span></strong>, <strong><span>Dogmatika Theo, the Iron Punch</span></strong>, <span><strong>Archnemeses Protos</strong></span>, and one more <span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed</strong></span> <strong><span>[</span>∞]</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  <strong><span>Ideal Starting Hand: </span></strong>(2nd turn)  *[Edit: I misread <span><strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong></span>'s effect. Once you use its effect to add Monster to your hand, you cannot Extra Deck-summon. Also, I overlooked <span><span><span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span></span></span><span>'s effect, which limits you to Synchro Summoning after you use its effect.</span>] <ul>  	<li><span><strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin <span>[F]</span></strong></span>, (Either of these <strong>Familiar Possessed</strong> monsters: <strong><span>Eria</span></strong><span> or</span> <strong><span>Wynn</span></strong>), <span><strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</strong><span>, <span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</strong><span>, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span></span></span></li> </ul> This hand is perfect if you go second.

Depending on the card you drew with <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed</strong><span>'s</span></span> <span><strong>[∞] </strong>effect, at your own discretion, you can try using the monster's effect to resurrect a GY monster <em>(Remember from now on, you can only Summon Synchros from the Extra Deck)</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li>(13B) Then Synchro Summon <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span> </span></span></strong></span>with your <strong>Lv 4</strong> Spellcaster (presumably <span><strong>Ecclesia</strong></span>) and <span><strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong></span>.</li> </ol> If all goes well, both routes would start you off with <span><strong><span>⌈<span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋ </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>and another powerful monster, as well as card effect or battle protection with your Continuous Spell/Trap. They also both set you up next turn for more combos.</span></span></span></span></span>  For other useful strategies in this deck, check out my other Charmer Deck, because many of those strategies apply here."

I play three Fleur De Les because you can sometimes set him up on your opponents turn and then if you have another or draw into another you have a negate set up. Also, this card helps to bring out dragoon as when its effects activate it does NOT lock you out of your extra deck. You then could easily go into aliester and if you have a light in your hand or opponents gy you can link Aliester into Almirja and then fuse into mechaba anf then link Almirja and Fleur De Les into Predaplant. You would finish the turn with a mechaba and a dragoon possibly. Another great set up is getting winda and Dragoon or Mechaba on the field at the same time. This really makes it tough for your opponent to play if they do not have dark ruler or droplet. Foolish burial is huge for when you need to set up some Shadoll stuff or send aliester to the gy if you draw into invocation without him. I also really like siding in the Invoker of Maddness because his name changes to Aleister in the gy, so you can set your gy for next turn with nadir. Finally, I just wanted to shoud out ice dragon's prison. This card has been unbelievable for me so far. I think it is highly under rated and should be considered more for the called by the grave replacement people are looking for. Still need help with the extra deck so any suggestions would be welcome!"

Use Nadir Servant to set up by tossing Apkallone into the GY to search for any Shaddoll card THEN discard a shaddoll monster to proc their effect. The deck runs less hand traps (8) compared to the usual Invoked Dogmatika deck (12-15) but it can easily set up more aggressive pushes and a more consistent Winda.  Reason I use Veiler over Imperm because I would be able to use Veiler as fusion fodder for more consistent Mechaba/Construct (better this format because CBTG is at 1) but imperm works as well.  I do really like Schism because this build thins the deck out so well and you are able to get out easy Winda/Construct/Apkallone plays on opponent turns and act as a disruptor to remove 1 monster in the field (doesn't target or destroy).  -You can use Apkallone to negate monster effects/Winda as floodgate/Construct plays to dump cards like Ariel and Dragon which is really useful against banishing Eldlich from the GY and destroying Field Spells (Boot, Numeron Network, Ravine, etc) in this meta.  Alternative Builds:  -You can remove the Resh/Cross-Sheep for 1 more hand trap and replace Cross-sheep for a 5k ATK fusion monster (Five-Headed Dragon or Dragon Master Knight) for a higher ceiling atk removal for Dogmatika Punishment or Augoeides 8k ATK OTK. However, going against towers/Dragoon requires link 4s like Borrelsword or Accesscode to get over ATK threshold which resh/cross-sheep can help pump out.  -You can actually add more hand-traps and the deck can still run smoothly at 42-43.  -Add Predaplant in Extra but I did not really use the card often so I opted with a Cross-Sheep instead as an extender. If you still want cross-sheep with Predaplant, you can take out 1 Mechaba/Winda/Construct.  -Foolish burial is a great searcher (dump Hedgehog/Ariel) or a way to reduce opponent's resources in GY and S/T zone (Ariel/Dragon).  Overall, I am very happy with this build but if there is something I can improve, please let me know in the comments or your thoughts :)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With Pantheism of the Monarch's moving from Limited to Unlimited in the recent Limited &amp; Forbidden List, it's time to revisit an old classic. This build of Monarch's focuses on the Field Spell ""Domain of the True Monarchs"" which restricts your opponent from Summoning Extra Deck monsters while boosting the ATK/DEF of your Tribute Summoned monsters as well as reducing the Levels of your higher-level Monarchs, allowing for you to Tribute Summon them using only one Monster.  </span>The main board you want to make if going first is Vanity's Fiend, Domain, and The Monarch's Erupt set. This stops your opponent from Special Summoning while protecting Vanity's from monster effects due to Erupt as well from battle due to Domain (Vanity's Fiend will gain 800 ATK from Domain, giving it 3200 ATK during combat only.) Erebus and Ehther are both at 3 in this deck due to their strong on-field effects and utility. Some small tech cards include Thestalos the Mega Monarch to give us information about the opponent's hand as well as disrupting their plays, Called by the Grave to prevent Edea from being Ashed, Foolish Burial to dump Erebus, Upstart Goblin for extra consistency, and one Kuraz for consistency as well as getting rid of The Prime Monarch.  Any suggestions for improvement are welcome in the comments. :)"

I've tried a lot of hybrid strategies with Fossils and I think this is the strongest one so far. The Invoked engine has decent synergy with the Fossil engine, as well as covering a good amount of Fossils' weaknesses.  Fossils are at their worst going 1st, whereas Invoked has gives you access to reasonable lines going 1st while not asking for too much deck space or many specific cards in hand. This is the biggest draw to this particular hybrid. I've also enjoyed using Fossils with other fusion archetypes because Weathering Soldier has good synergy with effects that send him to the GY, including fusion spells.  If given the choice we will go 2nd.  <strong>Main deck</strong>:  Nibiru - A big rock monster for Fossil Fusion, as well as a light to get access to Mechaba. He also has the benefit of setting up our opponent's GY for our Fossil Fusion and Invocation.  Kumongous - Kaiju's as a great way to both take care of annoying cards on our opponent's board as well as set up their GY for a Skullgios fusion. Kumongous gets the nod over Gameciel due to his Earth type. Extra deck space is limited in this deck and there is not room for the Water Invoked fusion. We're good at dumping attack onto the board, so the extra 200 attack from Kumongous won't be a problem.  Weathering Soldier - Our tutor for the Fossil archetype. Works when being fused with Invocation from the hand, as well as with Foolish Burial, Miracle Rupture, and Mathematician. He also beats down quite wel. Staple for all Fossil strats.  Aleister the Invoker - We're playing Invoked, so obviously we play him. Note he can choose any fusion monster, not just Invoked ones. This can lead to huge damage with Skullking, or even with a Skullgios if you played it off of Time Stream.  Mathematician - Aleister is obviously our #1 normal summon most of the time, but we won't always have him. Mathematician bulks up our count to help ensure we have a strong enabler to normal summon. Dumping Weathering Soldier or Keystone can be great, and he's also a 1500 attack monster to res off of Cross-Sheep.  Ash Blossom - Best hand trap in the game IMO. We are a going 2nd deck, so we want to be sure to load up on hand traps to disrupt our opponent from setting up an unbreakable board. She also gives access to Purgatrio.  Nemeses Keystone - An aptly named card, this is a key component in a lot of the plays our deck can make. Gives good value when fused off of Fossil Fusion or Invocation from the GY, helping to keep our hand stocked for Mechaba and Skull King. Not only that, but he's an easy access special summon to set up easy link summons (I'm looking at your, Cross-Sheep) and can recycle our fusions back into our extra deck.  Magical Meltdown - Tutors Aleister.  Dark Hole - I was running Lightning Storm, but the fact that we have Magical Meltdown in play a lot of the time made it a pretty big nonbo for the deck. We only get to play 1 Raigeki, so Dark Hole helps us get tasty fusion targets in our opponent's yard to set up our big plays.  Extra-Foolish Burial - The ultimate swiss army knife of the deck. It gets you missing combo pieces for fusion, or it can bin any of your fossils that work out of the GY. It has so many situations it's useful in that it's hard to list them all.  Fossil Fusion - Makes our Fossils.  Harpie's Feather Duster - This was another card that was Lightning Storm, but again that card was too much of a problem with Magical Meltdown. I wanted a main-deck out to Mystic Mine, and this is the best S/T removal in the game.  Invocation - Just 1 copy since Aleister can find it easily, and we have access to effectively 7 copies of him in the deck between him, Meltdown, and Terraforming.  Miracle Rupture - Sets up our GY as well as acts as a tutor when paired with Weathering Soldier. Don't leave home without 3.  Raigeki - The freshmaker. Easy, low-risk board removal. Raigeki is as Raigeki does.  Terraforming - Effectively copy #4 of Magical Meltdown, as we don't run any other field spells. Naturally if you wanted to side any field spells, this would act as a nice redundancy piece for them as well.  Time Stream - 3 may seem like a lot, but you really want to start with 1 in hand for the lines where you want it. If you can't easily make a big Fossil monster, you can make a Skull Bone, Time Stream it, remove if from GY to tutor another Time Stream, and then Time Stream the Skull Knight into either Skull King or Skullgios.  Impertinence - 2nd best hand trap in the game, and gives us some traps on the off chance we want them for Mechaba.  <strong>Extra deck</strong>:  Mechaba - Best Invoked monster. Easy access to it by normal summoning Aleister and linking him into Almiraj and then Secure Gardna.  Skullgios - Often the strongest Fossil Fusion. Not much to say here. Skullgios ends games.  Magellanica - We have a lot of Earth monsters, so this is an easy include. Nice and big to help us OTK. Conveniently also a Rock monster for Fossil Fusion.  Skull King - This is the fossil we most often will fuse in to, so we play 2. He's easier to access than Skullgios, and can often be better. He's also our strongest fossil monster to lead off with if we are forced to go first.  Augoeides - We make a lot of fusions, so this is a no brainer. Very often the best way to kill if our initial wave of fusions get answered.  Purgatrio - Ash Blossom and Almiraj give us access to this. Great on a lot of boards.  Skull Knight - Often just the in-between for Skull King or Skullgios. His remove from GY effect can also be relevant.  Skullgar - Less useful than his cousin Skull Bone, but sometimes exactly what you need. Notably the highest attack Cross-Sheep target in the deck.  Skull Bone - Sets up an easy Skull King or Skullgios with the aforementioned line using Time Stream.  Knightmare Phoenix - Having an MST in the extra deck is too useful. I never leave home without 1.  Secure Gardna - Almost strictly a Mechaba enabler, but he can sometimes clutch out a game by turning a simple Keystone -&gt; Linkuriboh into 1000 attack.  Cross-Sheep - Always be on the look out for lines involving this little guy! He easily can turn what would be a turn shy 8000 damage into an OTK. Too many ways to enable him in the deck to list, so just be looking for it.  Linkuriboh - We have easy to play 1 star monsters, so we play Linkuriboh. Sometimes it's also nice to be able to force a Keystone into the GY to set up a fossil fusion.  Almiraj - Only needed for the Secure Gardna -&gt; Mechaba line, which is extremely important."

The main goal is to get ""GP Dreary Doll"" into the GY asp. Until Maxx ""C"" comes back, going second sucks in this game and pure GP sucks to, so if this deck is to have a chance of being viable, it has to have as many board breaking cards as possible. The main combo is kaiju your opponent’s problem monsters, then SS “GP of Strings” or ""Dingirsu"" somehow, then upgrade it into #84, then clear the board with #84’s effect, then upgrade #84 into #77 for 4000 burst damage, then finish by upgrading #77 into ""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"" during MP2, which really throws a monkey wrench into your opponent's next turn. If you happen to have “Condolence Puppet"" in your GY, you can banish it to protect Divine Arsenal from being destroyed card effects. If you’re lucky you can bust out two #77s with “Inferno Reckless Summon” for game. I recently discovered the ""Zoo King Alpha"" card and tried it out. Initially, it did well but I had to boot the ""GP Gear Changers"" to make room for them. I've had alot of success with it especially since GP have low ATK and the kaijus I give my opponent have high ATK. The bane of this deck is back row and negates, so save your Feather Duster and Lightning Storms until you're sure you can compromise your opponent with Divine Arsenal for the rest of the game. I also tried #97 and It works pretty well to, but only if your opponent literally has nothing to stop that 9000 attack, which they usually do."

You can simply use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> to gain LP and pop with <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram""><strong>Aromaseraphy Sweet</strong> <strong>Marjoram</strong></a>. <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> can be used to accel synchro summon with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> during your opponent's turn: <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Formula%20Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a></strong> into <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borreload%20Savage%20Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> for negate or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong> into either <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Satellite%20Warrior"">Satellite Warrior</a></strong> for a double pop or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Phoenix"">Crystron Phoenix</a></strong> to deal with a heavy backrow. Also, it is so easy to OTK with this deck thanks to the swarming ability of plant monsters and all the good synchro beatsticks got enough atk for an easy <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borrelsword%20Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a></strong> OTK.</span>  <span>The main way to open your combo is to bring out 2 plants to make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> and another monster for the tribute of it's effect. There're multiple ways &amp; cards combinations in this deck that can accomplish this:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Ophrys%20Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a></strong> + 1 monster: <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Ophrys%20Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a></strong> send 1 monster from the hand to the GY → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> → add <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Instant%20Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></strong> → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thousand-Eyes%20Restrict"">Thousand-eyes Restrict</a></strong>.

However, If you've already opened with one, this is a good way to start off your combos for that extra plus.</span></li> </ul> <span>There're still many ways to open the combo depending on your opening hand that I can't list all of them here but you'll eventually find the way playing the deck. Now to the main combo:</span>  <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine""><strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong></a> tribute 1 monster to ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> tribute <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> to ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> link into <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> → ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> using it's effect → make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Spore"">Spore</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> → <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> ss <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> → make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong> → search <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> → add back <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> to the hand with it's effect.</span> <h2><span><strong><span>Decklist &amp; Ratios:</span></strong></span></h2> <ul>  	<li><span>The main deck is 48 cards because there are lots of bricks for the combos so I increased both the amount of starters and staples to reduce the chance of drawing into multiple bricks.</span></li>  	<li><span>This deck runs quite a lot of staples like handtraps compare to it's casual version because it usually takes you only 2-3 cards to get the combo going while there're not that many extenders available for plant archetypes and the only good ones I can think of are <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=One%20for%20One"">One for One</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Monster%20Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong>.</span></li>  	<li><span>The <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Called%20by%20the%20Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> hit definitely hurted the deck since it's a rogue combo deck, thankfully <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=PSY-Framegear%20Gamma"">Psy-framegear Gamma</a></strong> still gives the deck some help protecting <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lonefire%20Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Solar%20Nutrient"">Super Solar Nutrient</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong> &amp;<strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=One%20for%20One""> One for One</a></strong> from getting handtrap. However, I personally don't like running <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Triple%20Tactics%20Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a></strong> as a replacement for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Called%20by%20the%20Grave""><strong>Called by the Grave</strong></a> because, as I mentioned, the deck doesn't have that many good extenders to draw into after getting handtrap.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 copies of <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> instead of 1 because the Predaplant combo is quite important due to how much consistency it gives the deck. You'll still have about 10% chance of drawing into it if playing only at 1 copy in a 48 cards deck, but approximately 1% chance of drawing all copies of it if playing at 2 (Yes, I unironically did the math on <strong><a>yugioh.party</a></strong>).</span></li>  	<li><span>There are multiple lv3 to send with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong> for making <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Satellite%20Warrior"">Satellite Warrior</a></strong>, but the only lv4 for making <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crystron%20Phoenix"">Crystron Phoenix</a></strong> I play is <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=World%20Carrotweight%20Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a></strong>. It's a plant with good stats so in case of drawing it, you can try to send it to the GY and shuffle it back with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> if needed for the effect of <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Shooting%20Riser%20Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></strong>. It also has a useful effect for spamming the field that works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> since you can send <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> to ss it then add <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Rose%20Girl"">Rose Girl</a></strong> back every turn. Otherwise there're not many lv4 I want to run in this deck.</span></li>  	<li><span>Casual Aromage builds usually run more LP gainers but in this build I only run 5 since my strategy doesn't rely that much on them thanks to the Predaplant engine and I don't like drawing too many of them. Aromages don't have a good way to protect their backrows so relying too much on them would be a big weakness in this format which spell/trap removals are very commonly seen. Also, I only run the ones that let me decide when to gain LP so my Aromages ain't triggered accidentally.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aroma%20Gardening"">Aroma Gardening</a></strong> because it's the best one for my strategy I believe. It can be used in either player's turn, works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong>'s revival effect and has an extra defensive effect. Although it's only once per turn so drawing too many copies might be a bad thing but I think it's worth to increase the chance of having it.</span></li>  	<li><span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aroma%20Garden""><strong>Aroma Garden</strong></a> is more important in casual builds since the atk/def boost definitely helps a lot to prevent <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> from being destroyed... but not that much in this build which doesn't end with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> so I only run 1.</span></li>  	<li><span>2x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> so if the first one get blowed away (which happens a lot when I try playing against metas), I can try to make a 2nd <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Sweet%20Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a></strong> to search the other one since <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> helps out a lot during grind games. You can also run the other Aroma traps (<strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Humid%20Winds"">Humid Winds</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dried%20Winds"">Dried Winds</a></strong>), I just don't like playing too many backrows.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 spell/trap removals because this deck still struggles against backrows when going 2nd, especially floodgates.</span></li>  	<li><span>2 targets for <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Darlingtonia%20Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a></strong> to search so it's easier to go +1 and <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> is a very good one in this format.</span></li>  	<li><span>It's really up to you to choose <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Instant%20Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></strong>'s target, I personally like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thousand-Eyes%20Restrict"">Thousand-eyes Restrict</a></strong> as a good way to deal with monsters that cannot be destroyed and it helps opening for an OTK too. You can also use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mudragon%20of%20the%20Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a></strong> as a 2nd <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>'s target or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sea%20Monster%20of%20Theseus"">Sea Monster of Theseus</a></strong> as a good lv5 tuner,...</span></li>  	<li><span>You must have noticed that <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Verte%20Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> but without the <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes%20Dark%20Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> engine, the deck can definitely run it well like most other rogue decks if you'd like to. It's just me, I've already run 48 cards to avoid bricks and I don't like any extra bricks. I run <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Super%20Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> though and it works really well with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Verte%20Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> too thanks to it's effect. It's also a good way to link non-plant monsters into a plant one to make <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong> or to be sent to the GY with <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blessed%20Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> as a way to play around <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mystic%20Mine"">Mystic Mine</a></strong>.</span></li> </ul> <h2><span><strong>Side Deck &amp; Tech Options:</strong></span></h2> <span>Giving the opponent LP advantage would be a big risk in this deck as it could potentially prevent <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromage%20Jasmine"">Aromage Jasmine</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromage%20Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Angelica"">Aromaseraphy Angelica</a></strong>'s effects which are very important. That's why I'll be avoiding cards like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Cosmic%20Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong>, <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red%20Reboot"">Red Reboot</a></strong>, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Solemn%20Judgment""><strong>Solemn Judgment</strong></a>,... despite how good they are. Here are what I'm currently using:</span> <ul>  	<li><span>1x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dinowrestler%20Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></strong>: good for going 2nd, can definitely help for a <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Borrelsword%20Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a></strong> OTK.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Nibiru%2C%20the%20Primal%20Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong>: good against most combo decks.

It can also be tributed for <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aromaseraphy%20Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a></strong>'s effect if necessary.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Artifact%20Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong>: good against a lot of current top tiers like Virtual World, Dino, Invoked, Eldlich,... and may stop stuffs like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong><strong>.</strong></span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Forbidden%20Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong>: good against multiple negates and monsters that cant be targeted like <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes%20Dark%20Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> or <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mekk-Knight%20Crusadia%20Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong>,... which the deck definitely struggles to deal with. Running <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Ruler%20No%20More"">Dark Ruler No More</a></strong> may not be a good idea in this deck as you won't be able to use <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong>'s effect afterward.</span></li>  	<li><span>2x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lightning%20Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong>: good against backrows.</span></li>  	<li><span>3x <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong>: also good against backrows, the main deck is 48 cards so it's harder to get access to backrow removals than usual.

Or deal huge da,"Hello everyone, this my first deck profile I'm submitting so please pardon me if I do something wrong. The point of this Numeron deck is like most, turbo out Utopic Zexal or Megaclops with ease, but the Time Thieves provide some useful support. Time Thief Redoer can banish itself from the field allowing Numeron Calling to activate, and thanks to Time Thief Winder we can easily search Retrograde, which is an counter trap that can negate an S/T and attach it to a Time Thief xyz. This is particularly useful against the common Infinite Impermanance, which would render our S0 useless. The ideal first turn is to summon Redoer with Regulator bringing out Winder and Bezel Ship, search Retrograde with Winder, banish Redoer by its own effect, and then activating Calling either by Network or in your hand to summon 3 Gates and make S0. When Redoer returns in the end phase your Retrograde will be live. On following turns you can summon Perpetua and attach Time Thief cards from the deck to S0 as xyz materials, keeping its attack up and allowing it to continue using its effect. If you want to push you for damage you can simply summon the 4 gates and attack with them, which can net easy otks in simplified gamestates. Megaclops is a backup ""Towers"" that can also be bought out with the Gates and can recur xyzs from the gy but not turn its summoned.  &nbsp;  I won't pretend this a meta contender or the best use of the Numeron Engine, but I think it has some interesting synergy. I've been playing a lot of Time Thief variants so expect more of that in the future, especially with some of the fantastic cards in Phantom Rage and Genesis Impactors. Thank you for reading my ramblings."

Since the only Tuner in the Deck was <strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong>, and most of the other monsters in the deck were either Level 3 or 4, unless you had any of the <strong>Awakening Possessed</strong> monsters out, you could only summon Level 6, 7, or 9 monsters. Not that it was particularly necessary to do so in the first place... With that being said, <span><strong>Zoroa </strong><span>b</span></span>eing a Level 4 Tuner means he's a perfect tool for summoning almost anything in your Extra Deck, no matter what other monster is out:</span> <ul>  	<li>If he's out with a Lv 3 <strong>Charmer</strong>, you can bring out <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Fortune Lady Every<span>⌋</span></span></strong> or <strong><span>⌈</span></strong><span><strong>Arcanite Magician<span>⌋</span></strong></span> easily.</li>  	<li>If he's out with a Lv 4, you can bring out <span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Time Thief Redoer</span><span>⌋</span></strong><span>, <strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span>⌋</strong><strong>, </strong>or <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span><span>⌋</span></strong><span><span>, easily.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If he's out with a Lv 5 <strong>Awakening Possessed</strong> monster, you can bring out <strong><span>⌈</span><span><span>Datascape Fox - Xianxian</span><span>⌋</span></span></strong><span><span><span> easily.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li>And of course he can easily bring out at least 1 of your <strong>Link Charmers</strong> with ANY monster out, since he is a FIRE monster.</li> </ul> <span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong><span>'s effect is super versatile as well. First of all, it's a Spellcaster with 1500 DEF, which is perfect for this Deck and is why I put him in here in the first place. Since its effect is a ""1 per turn"" effect, you can keep using it until you run out of Extra Deck cards to use on it.  Also, with the new cards <em>in</em> the Extra Deck, you can use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect for a variety of situations. If you use his effect on <span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Maiden Artemis</span><span>⌋</span></strong></span>, you can bring out another <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>, so that if something happens to your <strong><span>Zoroa</span> </strong>on the field, you can just Summon another one next turn. Or if you have <span><strong>Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin</strong></span> <span><strong>[F]</strong></span> on the field, you can then swap your other <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span> for your <span><strong>Inari Fire</strong></span>, which can set you up for an easy Link, Xyz, or Synchro Summon. If you're in a pinch where you opponent has a powerful monster out, as long as it can be destroyed by card effects, you can use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect on <span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span>⌋</strong><span>. Then, not only are you safe from most Spell/Trap effects, but you can destroy <em>almost</em> any opponent's monster, <em>nearly</em> risk free. <strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong>'s<strong>⌋</strong> effect isn't nearly as versatile with <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect as the other two, but if you're close to end-game and your opponent's field is weak, you can use it to clear the field, then let your powerful monster(s) attack.</span></span></span></span></span>  <strong>Now let's talk about the new Extra Deck monsters' stand-alone effects:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><span><span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Dragon Vafram</span>⌋</strong><span> has a very self-explanatory stand-alone effect. It makes your opponent hesitant to attack it, for fear of a full, one-sided, field-nuke. If you already have <strong><span>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</span></strong> in your GY, you can troll your opponent's fear by just using <strong><span>Nefarious</span></strong>'s GY effect. Since it <em>destroys</em> the monster you target, <span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span>'s<span><strong>⌋</strong><span> will activate, anyway. That way you'll still have a versatile monster on the field, <em>and</em> you still get your field-nuke. Even better, if you already had <span><strong>Unpossessed</strong></span> <strong>[</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong>∞</strong><strong>]</strong><span> out, since </span><span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span><span><strong>⌋</strong></span><span> was <em>destroyed</em>, you could use said Trap to bring out </span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span><span>. Then on your next turn, just use </span><span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span><span>'s effect to equip it with </span><strong>⌈<span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong><span>. Now, along with </span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Ninaruru</span></strong><span>'s</span><strong>⌋</strong><span> effect, you get 3 Direct 1500-point Attacks.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Goddess Ninaruru</span></strong><span><strong>⌋</strong> is slightly less useful. If you're out of <strong>Familiar-Possessed</strong> monsters when <span><strong>Awakening of the Possessed </strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>[</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong>∞</strong><strong>]</strong> is still on the field<span><span><span><span>, you can use </span></span></span></span><strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><span>'s</span><strong>⌋</strong><span> effect to bring one of them back. Then Summon it to get your Draw. If you already have <span><span><strong>Grand Spirit Art - Ichirin</strong></span> <span><strong>[F]</strong></span></span> on the field, you could use her effect to bring out one of your <strong>Charmers</strong> or other elemental Spellcasters, and swap <em>it</em> out with one of the <span><span><span><strong>Familiar</strong> monsters (</span><strong><span>Jigabyte</span></strong><span>,</span> <span><strong>Inari Fire</strong></span><span>,</span> <strong><span>Ranryu</span></strong><span>,</span> <strong><span>Nefarious Archfiend of Nefariousness</span></strong><span><span>)</span></span><span>. You could also use her effect on one of the <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters. Then just Special Summon it with its effect. Heck, even use it on <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>, then you can just Summon him and use <em>his</em> effect to equip either <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong> or him with </span></span></span></span><span><strong>⌈</strong></span><span><strong>Vafram</strong></span><span><strong>⌋</strong></span><span><span><span><span>. Then you can keep resurrecting Spellcasters without worrying about Spell/Trap effects, </span><em>and</em><span> you can bulwark your opponent's monsters with some slightly higher ATK.</span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>⌈</span><span>Magistus Maiden Artemis</span><span>⌋<span> </span></span></strong><span>is probably the least immediately useful monster when she is Summoned. In fact, it's likely best to avoid summoning her in most cases, and just use <span><strong>Zoroa</strong></span>'s effect to equip her directly instead. There are a couple situations where her stand-alone effect would be useful. If your opponent already has an Extra Deck monster out, and you conveniently have both of your <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters and another Spellcaster in your hand, you could Summon all 3 (using <strong>Dogmatika</strong>s' effects to Special Summon them). Next, <em>first </em>Link Summon <strong><span>⌈</span><span>Artemis</span><span>⌋ </span></strong>with the non-<strong>Dogmatika</strong> Spellcaster monster, <em>then</em> Xyz Summon <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong> with the <strong>Dogmatika</strong> monsters. Then <strong><span>⌈</span></strong><span><strong>Artemis</strong><span>'s</span></span><strong><span>⌋</span></strong><span> </span><span>effect will activate and you can equip her to <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong><strong>⌋</strong>, use her effect to bring out <span><strong>Zoroa</strong><span>, and use <strong>⌈<span>Ninaruru</span></strong>'s<strong>⌋</strong> stand-alone effect to bring back one of the <strong>Dogmatika</strong>s. Then just Special Summon that monster from your hand using its effect again. Even better, if you already had one of the <strong>Familiar</strong> monsters in your hand as well, you could then use <em>their</em> effects to Special Summon any of them, allowing you to Xyz Summon <strong>⌈<span>Time Thief Redoer</span>⌋</strong> as a final move before a double Xyz attack.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>⌈</span><span>Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</span><span>⌋ </span></span></span></strong><span>is a little difficult to figure out, at the moment. If you know you'll be summoning a lot of monsters in one turn, I think this card could be useful. Especially if you plan on Synchro or Xyz Summoning or if your opponent has a powerful non-Xyz monster. It lets you change any Special Summoned monster's level to any number from 1 - 8. Then you can also destroy that monster and an opponent's monster with the same Level. So depending on how you want to use it, you can either Extra Summon a monster or destroy an opponent's monster. If you have <span><strong>Teamwork of the Possessed</strong></span> set at least 1 turn before you use <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong>'s<strong><span>⌋</span></strong> effect, you could destroy up to 2 cards in succession. Use said Trap to summon a Charmer with a different Attribute than <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong><strong><span>⌋</span></strong>, destroy a card, and then change that monster's Level to your opponent's monster Level, and use <strong><span>⌈<span>Puzzlomino</span></span></strong>'s<strong><span>⌋</span></strong> other effect to destroy their monster. It works in <em>and</em> out of the Extra Zone, so you don't always have to sacrifice a Link monster to use the effect.</span></span></span></span></li> </ul> That's it for this deck. From here on, until there are any more support cards added, this will be my last Charmer Deck."

The cutest deck ever made meets one of the ugliest archetypes ever printed. Since Melffy and Ojama monsters are both Level 2, Beast-Type, and share the same affinity for swarming the field it should come as no surprise that the two are perfect for each other. The main goal with this deck is to resolve Ojama Red or Rescue Cat as early as possible to begin building your board of Rank 2 Beast Xyz monsters or Link monsters, from there you can have a board with Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax, Melffy Mommy with multiple materials, etc. Valerifawn can help to set up Ojama Red's effect for next turn by discarding Ojamgic for its cost, this will get you a Rank 2 Xyz (preferably Ronin Raccoon as it can not only survive for a long time will it has a Raccoon Token out, but that token can also later be used for more Link plays on your turn.)  As an additional option, instead of returning your Melffy monsters to the hand on your opponents turn, I have also included Wonder Xyz which will allow you to Xyz Summon on your opponents turn as well as being able to bait your opponent into using removal for it due to the threat of Playhouse (which is even more potent in this deck since Melffy Mommy will likely have +3 or 4 materials on her most any given time.)  As always, suggestions are welcome. :)"

I went into this project with little expectations, but lo and behold: the deck functins in the Meta! It doesn't win a whole ton, but it's annoying and can work around blockades with surprising effeciency. It also took me two weeks to tweek and perfect (I'm a perfectionist, OK?), but as a whole I am completely satisfied with how it turned out.  The basic idea is to be flexable with it. What you really want to get out is Time Pendulumgraph with Timestar Magician, so that you can get rid of two cards your opponent controls (notice: with Time Pendulumgraph's wording, you can destroy something and then SEND A CARD TO THE GY WITHOUT TARGETTING IT. An effective way to get rid of Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon or, I dunno, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). This is an ideal, as it also allows you to summon Zarc real easy, so obviously it can be negated  by any Ash Blossom or Ghost Ogre even. Heck, Haunted Mansion can negate Timestar's protective effect.  But any way you look at it, Timestar is your ideal. Get him, and your Pendulum scale and Pendulum monsters are saved. You can also use his effect to add Chronograph Sorcerer, who is nessecary to summon Zarc. Can you tell I really didn't understand much of the support Magicians have if you use it right?  Speaking of a Pendulum scale, PENDULUM SUMMONING IS UNDERRATED. It really can save your butt. Not to mention that Called By the Grave doesn't really against this deck because the monsters don't go to the Graveyard, but that doesn't really matter because it's limitted now anyways...  but hey, it's kinda nice you can summon some of your most powerful monsters back from the dead every turn. Also about Pendulum summoning: you usually want Oafdragon and Black Fang in you Pendulum Zones. Oafdragon's recycling effect is invaluble, especially when you need another Harmonizing Magician to power your combos. Black Fang was chosen because... he's got a good effect when he's destroyed? Has multiples? Yeah, I really don't know. Harmonizing Magician or Double Iris will suffice.  Now, TO THE EXTRA DECK! Oh, gosh, I spent AGES on this. Zarc is an obvious Why not? card. Borreload Savage is there 'cause EPIC NEGATION. Also, he's probably the strongsst monster in the deck... yeah. Need him. Enlightenment Palladen is nice for recycling those spells you need (ie. Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance). Clear Wing's an obvious choice with Nobledragon OR Metal Marcher (your pick), and Meteorburst Dragon's second effect is so darn useful today. Metal Marcher can be summoned by Halqifibrax, and can summon those Level 7s. Norito is a given since Oafdragon and Chronograph exist. Timestar I've already described. Abyss Dweller's there because... Abyss Dweller (also Graveyard effects need to be negated at some point). Avarmax is there as protection and as the second-strongest (if not strongest) card in the deck. He also is significantly easier to summon with Pendulum monsters :/ . Saryuja is just nice, since you can summon 3 dead monsters with 300 extra ATK. Metaltron is nice with this deck, as it recycles AND gets rid of your opponent's key cards on the field for a turn for relatively cheap (considering Pendulum monsters can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck). Triple Burst is and easy-out spell negater that can do some damage and also can produce good fodder for Savage when you return Day-Breaker to your field using Triple's third effect. Day-Breaker's there for ease of access and destructive potential, also allowing 2 rebirths from the Extra Deck, giving him power. Halqifibrax is there because all decks with synchro additions are considered worthless without him (also he's there for Metal Marcher to be summoned, in turn letting Meteorburst or Clear Wing to be summoned with ease).  Now the main deck. This makes more sense when you have the Extra Deck laid out for you, so here it goes: Kaijus, Ash Blossom, Triple Tactic, Luna, and Effect Veiler are all self-explanatory (Effect Veiler instead of Impernance because this is a Spellcaster deck! Also, when paired with Oafdragon or Chronograph, it can make those level 7s). Oafdragon and Chronograph's uses have been listed before (recycling and Summon fuel respectively). Black Fang is a great recycler for Timestar when it's destroyed, also usful for any Extra Deck fodder you want (and I do mean ANY). White Wing is there for the summoning of Zarc and link fodder, but no other reasons. Doble Iris searches Time and Star Pendulumgraphs and has an epic pendulum effect (hence the reason she was banned: use pendulum effect, search Pendulumgraph card). Also nessecary for Zarc (no Odd-eyes here!). Harmonizing Magician is a BEAST, openning up all of your key plays (Timestar especially, though. It gets around the ""banished when leaves the field"" part) and being generally awesome. Can also be recycled by Oafdragon's pendulum effect, so she's not useless in the Extra Deck. Nobledragon, because now you can't draw out of cards (also gets pretty epic synchros out)! She's pretty uefull for when Halqifibrax is summoned too. Left and Right Hands are in for negation, though they are decent discard fodder for Pendulum Call. Star and Time Pendulumgraphs are just plain amazing (especially together) and are relatively easy to search. Duelist Alliance searches Pendulum Call, the Pendulumgraphs AND Double Iris (she counts as a ""Pendulum Dragon"" card). It's a nessecity, because Pendulum Call is amazing, allowing you to search a Pendulim scale from your DECK, all for 1 discard. Not to mention the cards are protected until the end of the turn. It's pretty sweet.  Many of the Side Deck cards are self-explainatory. The only one that isn't (Timegazer) is there because of Chronograph Sorcerer's pendulum effect, should you ever need it.  You can mess with this deck idea all you want. In fact, you may want some Haunted Mansion's in your side deck, in case your facing a deck that uses the GY like an extra two arms. To make it cheaper (but still effective), you can swap Triple Tactic for pot cards (I'd go with Avarice od Aquisitiveness. Riches locks you out of your Extra Deck for the turn). You can also replace Savage with any number of level 8 Synchros (there's dozens of them). I've found that Norito doesn't really come out that often (and honestly his effect is already repeated b so many others in the deck), so you could switch him out if you want. I didn't, 'cause it's freak'n Norito, but what works for you works for me. I won't have to deal with it.  I'm looking at probably making a Fusion rendition of this deck in the future, along with an Insect deck, just because (wish me luck on that one!). I've made several other decks, but none are really noteworthy, so if you want to see them, look them up (I have a Tenyi deck and Super Quant deck, along with another, older Super Quant deck and a really old Magician and Odd-eyes deck that sucks).

Sounds good to me.,"So, this version of the Rokket list came out of my desire to incorporate Smoke Grenade of the Thief into the combos, to hand loop people for 1 targeted card. However, I didn't like that the combo route I'd seen required an additional extender. Instead, by incorporating Draco Masters of the Tenyi, we can burn the Herald (OR and extender to save it) and thus also get the combo even if we whiff on an extender, which to me feels a lot more reliable. It ends on Buster Lock + Savage + Dragoon, and with an extender also ends on Herald of the Arc Light (plus 1 hand loop, by summoning Vylon Cube, and synchro summoning Herald).  I think Dragoon is the best boss monster in Rokkets right now. It lets a deck that already plays through interruptions play through yet another interruption, and it helps break boards and contribute to absolutely insane ending boards. However, the dark Warrior package eats up too much space - it'd be fine to incorporate just the Codebreakers, but the Phantom Knights cards are really disruptive to the functioning of the deck (even if 10 negate boards are fun), and I don't think there are many worthwhile targets for the codebreaker package in the hand loop build. I'll definitely be trying using codebreakers to make Unchained Abomination in the future.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer helps break boards, but also contributes to the hand disruption, since it can be searched with Brotaur. The deck doesn't loop as many cards out of hands as Infernoble will, but even a single targeted snipe is great for providing the information you'll need to lock down games.  Go through the combo in the order it is played out in the Extra Deck and you should figure it out. You have to be mindful of zones for Triple Arrow with Tenyi link 3 and the Guardragons under them, pretty standard for decks running the guardragons. The real thing that might trip you up is you have to either make Herald + Halqifibrax into Draco Masters of the Tenyi OR you can use an extender here to end on an extra negate."

Can consistently set up multiple negates with Herald of Ultimateness, sometimes ","<h2>Introduction</h2> This deck aims to make use of the new <strong>Draitron</strong> Ritual archetype coming to the TCG in <strong>Genesis Impactors</strong>. Going first the goal is to set up as many negates as possible with <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a>, <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>. Going second, the deck can break boards with <a data-name=""Number 77: The Seven Sins"">Number 77: The Seven Sins</a> and easily OTK with it and <a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=DRA"">Draitron Meteornis=DRA</a>. The deck is able to run in-theme handtraps like <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Gnomaterial"">Gnomaterial</a> that double as discard fodder for Herald and help counter some of the top decks in the meta, particularly Phantom Knights or any deck that must banish cards. Since the deck also has many powerful Ritual monsters, it can play through Extra Deck lockout effects reasonably well too. And since the Draitron Ritual Spell allows summoning Ritual monsters from the Graveyard, the deck has surprising recursion and resilience so long as you have at least one Draitron or Ritual card in hand.  In anticipation of the inevitable ban of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, this deck instead uses <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> as a combo extender/mini Synchro engine.  Unfortunately the TCG does not yet have access to the key combo piece <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>, which allows for Tzolkin plays and significantly increases the consistency and ceiling of the deck. Unless Diviner is released soon this deck is only playable in the OCG or in automatic dueling simulators. Until then <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a> must be used instead.  Two card combos for this deck allow you to end on a Herald of Ultimateness with two omni-negates as well as a Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and an <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. Three card combos increase the ceiling significantly; high roll hands can end on not only Herald with 3-4 negates, Crystal Wing and I:P, but also make Herald immune to spell effects (including <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> !), and link into a 3-material Apollousa on your opponent's turn.  With <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> now Limited, this deck can struggle against handtraps or well-established boards if you cannot access your ritual spell or combo pieces. It is fairly susceptible to Ash Blossom but can dodge some targeting effects like Effect Veiler because the Draitrons activate in the GY. Drawing any of the small Herald cards can also allow you to negate a handtrap and continue your plays. If you are looking for a Ritual deck that can build surprisingly strong boards and take games off of meta decks after the September banlist, and that doesn't utilize the combos we've all seen before with Halqifibrax, look no further! <h2>Draitrons</h2> Draitrons are a Ritual-based archetype of LIGHT Machine monsters with a unique mechanic: Ritual summoning using ATK values (of Machine-type monsters) instead of levels. All of them cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, and activating their effects (from the hand or GY) lock you out of Special Summoning monsters that can be Normal Summoned for the rest of the turn. While this restriction seems unworkable, you are still allowed to normal summon and summon from the Extra Deck as well as Ritual Summon. As their Ritual spell <a data-name=""Meteornis Draitron"">Meteornis Draitron</a>is is generic, they are highly splashable and can support almost any Ritual archetype.  Each non-Ritual Draitron is level 1 with 2000 ATK/0 DEF, and their effects are activated by tributing another Ritual or Draitron monster from your hand or field, allowing you to Special Summon them in defense position with an additional effect. The 2 Ritual Draitron monsters are both level 12 with 4000 ATK/4000 DEF each and are untargetable by monster effects or Spell/Trap effects, respectively. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Ban-Alpha"">Draitron Ban-Alpha</a> is our main starter and searcher for the deck. You can tribute another Draitron or Ritual to search out a Ritual monster from the deck, usually <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> if you don't already have it or <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> otherwise. The biggest worry with this card is being hit by an opponent's Ash Blossom, as without access to Benten most of our plays are out of reach. Sometimes you can bait a potential Ash Blossom if you already have Benten in hand by tributing it with Alpha. Since it is tributed for cost you can still use Benten's effect after the chain resolves.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Al-Zeta"">Draitron Al-Zeta</a> is just like Alpha but searches Ritual Spells instead. Usually we'll want to use this card after having already used Alpha's effect, tributing the Ritual monster it just searched. We only run one Ritual Spell and access to it is crucial so this card is a three-of.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron El-Gamma"">Draitron El-Gamma</a> is an extender, not a searcher, allowing us to tribute a Ritual or Draitron monster to special summon itself and another Draitron in the GY. This is one of the only ways to summon a small Draitron in Attack position, which can be useful when you just need a bit more damage to OTK your opponent and all of your Draitrons are in defense. Although the card lets you extend farther, it is not as useful as Alpha or Zeta so we only run 2.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=DRA"">Draitron Meteornis=DRA</a> is the first of the Ritual boss monsters. While it is untargetable by monster effects and has 4000 ATK/DEF, we will rarely summon this card unless we need to OTK or have no other options. Its effect--banishing monsters from your GY whose total ATK equal 2000 or 4000, to target and send to the GY up to two of your opponent's monsters--can only be activated during your opponent's turn. It's great that this effect sends to the GY rather than destroying, but unfortunately it targets and so is not the best removal. We'll most often use this card as tribute fodder for another Ritual monster since it can fulfill the ATK requirement on its own.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Meteornis=QUA"">Draitron Meteornis=QUA</a> is the second Ritual boss and is rather situational, being untargetable by spells and traps and destroying all of your opponent's backrow when summoned. You should side this to replace DRA when facing decks with heavy backrow like Altergeist, Dogmatika or Phantom-Knights.</li> </ul> In addition to the main deck monsters there are 4 Draitron spells we will make use of: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Meteornis Draitron"">Meteornis Draitron</a> is our Ritual spell, able to summon any Ritual monster from your hand or GY by tributing Machines whose total ATK exceed its ATK. For the cost of lowering the ATK of a Draitron monster you control for the rest of the turn, you can return it back to your hand to use it again. Since this card provides natural recursion and usually allows you to use it twice per turn, you generally don't need to run more than one copy.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Nova"">Draitron Nova</a> special summons any non-ritual Draitron from the deck, destroying it during the end phase. This is an amazing starter, since we can link off the monster summoned into Linkuriboh and activate its effects from the GY. You'll want to always run 3, and almost always summon Alpha off of its effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Fafnir"">Draitron Fafnir</a> is our Field Spell, almost like a Ritual version of Magical Meltdown, that primarily searches other Draitron spells/traps. It prevents your Ritual spell cards from being negated, but this is rarely all that useful as your opponent can still chain to their activation. It can also be very useful against Synchro or Xyz-based decks: When a monster is Special Summoned you can decrease its level by 1 for every 1000 ATK it has, once per turn, if you control a Draitron monster. If you time this properly you can prevent your opponent from Synchro or Xyz Summoning their intended monster by decreasing the level of the Synchro or Xyz material. Run 2-3.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draitron Asterism"">Draitron Asterism</a> is an interesting Quick Play spell that provides targeted monster removal at the cost of decreasing a Draitron <em>or</em> Ritual monster's ATK by 1000. It can help you out of tight spots going second (for example, to destroy an opponent's Apollousa) and going first serves as another, searchable, disruption.</li> </ul> <h2>Fairies &amp; More</h2> The second half of our main deck monster lineup mainly consists of LIGHT Fairy monsters, mostly from the ""Herald"" archetype. In addition to their individual effects, all of them serve as extra discards/negates for Herald, so we want to run as many as possible, even for handtraps. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a> is our big, non-once-per-turn omni-negate stick, discarding Fairy monsters to negate effects. With 2000 ATK/3000 DEF it can be summoned with one Draitron or a boosted <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> and expect to survive a battle phase against whatever your opponent can normal summon. This can negate Special Summons as well, meaning it can stop monsters with effects on summon from activating at all. However, while Herald can negate the activation of Spell/Trap cards, it cannot negate their effects, meaning your opponent can use S/T effects in the GY or the effects of continuous or Field spells already on the field. You'll want to sit on this with as many Fairy monsters in hand as possible and carefully say ""no"" to whatever your opponent tries to do.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> is a weird, alien looking Fairy that is the ideal discard fodder for Herald. When it hits the GY you can banish up to two other LIGHT fairy monsters from it to add that many other level 2 or lower LIGHT fairies to your hand. Using it to negate something allows you to search two more negates!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> is the in-theme monster negate handtrap and our only hope of sometimes playing through Nibiru. Even though you have to go -2 to use it, discarding it and another Fairy, it is usually worth it if used on your opponent's key combo pieces or to save your board.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Purple Light"">Herald of Purple Light</a> is just like Orange but for Trap cards. It can save you from <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or other Normal traps, but it cannot negate the effects of traps already on the field like Personal Spoofing, nor counter trap cards like <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a> provides longevity in long games, returning itself to the hand at the cost of a monster from your hand or field, giving you a Herald negate each turn in combination with the Draitrons' effects. It's also another name to search off of Eva.</li> </ul> Next are the Fairy combo pieces, including the as-yet-unreleased Diviner: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a> is a level 2 Tuner that sends a fairy monster from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard to gain that monster's levels. By sending <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> or <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'Tss"">Elder Entity N'Tss</a> we can fill our GY with Fairies and search a Ritual monster/spell or pop a card, respectively. This also sets up Diviner to be a level 6 Tuner which is how we'll summon Tzolkin. You could use this card to go into Halqifibrax, but we won't. It's also a Herald discard in a pinch.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> is what makes the deck go brrrrr. Its effect to search a LIGHT Fairy when Tributed is not once per turn, and we aim to activate it at least twice per turn. Search it with Alpha then Tribute it with Zeta to search Diviner, use it as Herald fodder at the worst, etc. The most broken card in the deck and one you'll always want at 2-3 copies.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Natasha"">Cyber Angel Natasha</a> is Benten's little, level 5 sister. You can use it to steal your opponent's monsters (and its effect to do so is not once per turn!), but only if it has been properly Ritual Summoned and is in your GY with another Cyber Angel to banish. Since it only has 1000 ATK it's incredibly easy to summon and can turn the Duel in your favor if you take something big with it. You could probably cut this for another Benten or handtraps if you like.</li> </ul> Lastly are a few cards that raise the ceiling of the deck significantly: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is a 500 ATK Ritual monster that returns a Ritual monster from the GY to the hand and gains its level. It can also tribute monsters to Ritual Summon a Megalith card from your hand or deck. This allows us to use Benten's effect a second time, by returning it to the hand and tributing it, and in the process it also becomes level 6 for Tzolkin. Later in the game it can also return a level 12 Ritual monster to gain its level so that you can make a Rank 12 Xyz.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> is another Earth Ritual that draws and discards 1 card when Ritual Summoned. You'll almost always want to chain Benten's effect to this and discard something that can be in the GY, making it essentially a free draw. We'll rarely use its second quick effect to Ritual Summon a monster (using levels). This is the only Ritual monster you don't want in your GY as it can only be summoned by Phul from the deck or hand.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""B-Buster Drake"">B-Buster Drake</a> is our insurance against Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Equip this to Herald with Union Carrier and rest easily when your opponent activates either of those cards, as it will be immune to all of their spell effects. Be careful when dealing with cards like Mystic Mine, however, as they effect <em>you</em> and not your monsters. Not truly a garnet because if you draw it and can't equip it (if you used Union Carrier for Eva), it is Machine-type so can be used as tribute fodder.</li> </ul> <h2>Staples &amp; Going First/Second Cards</h2> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a>: Discards itself to negate an effect that targets your monster. Great against Impermance or Dogmatika Punishment.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>: HOPT searcher for any Draitron monster. Also if your opponent doesn't read and negates + destroys it, you can add it back and use it again.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>: Drop this on your opponent's board, banish it all with Seven Sins and set up with Herald, profit.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Execution of the Contract"">Execution of the Contract</a>: An equip spell that changes the levels of your monster to that of a Ritual in hand, and pops monsters if the equipped monster is tributed. The best way to make Sevin Sins and can be a quick effect pop if you tribute a Draitron with Linkuriboh's effect. Can provide an out to Apollousa or <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>, since Linkuriboh tributes for cost and Megaclops is susceptible to spell effects. Must run at 3 to be searchable with Power Tool Dragon.</li> </ul> <h2>Extra Deck</h2> <ul>  	<li>Diviner targets: <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'Tss"">Elder Entity N'Tss</a>: Arc Light searches Rituals and N'Tss targets and pops an opponent's card. Generally, only run as many as you can expect to send with Diviner.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a>: Level 12 monster made with Diviner + Phul. You can usually summon it two turns in a row, but you can cut one for something else if needed.</li>  	<li>Tzolkin targets: <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Power Tool Dragon"">Power Tool Dragon</a>: The former negates and runs over things, the latter searches Execution and is a Machine, so can be tributed.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number 77: The Seven Sins"">Number 77: The Seven Sins</a>: Banishes all your opponent's Special Summoned monsters. Usually made with Tzolkin and a monster raised to level 12 with Execution, but can be made other ways. It also has huge ATK and one-time destruction protection.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>: OTK potential. It's possible to replace this with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> if you prefer.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: Even more negates!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a>: Sometimes you get disrupted and this is all you can make. Can be strong when made with 2-3 Rituals if your opponent can't remove it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>: Can equip Eva to itself and be used to summon Herald, activating Eva, or can equip Herald with Buster Drake for spell immunity.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: Use this and Union Carrier to make an Apollousa on your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a>: In a pinch, this can get you the card you need if you summon a Ritual monster to its arrow. Also nice for climbing.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: Incredibly easy to summon with any Draitron. Great synergy with Execution since it tributes, and you can pretty much use it every turn.</li> </ul> <h2>Combos</h2> NS = Normal Summon  SS = Special Summon  RS = Ritual Summon  CL = Chain Link  You'll usually want to go first and set up Herald with as many Fairies in hand as you can get, preferably with protection for Herald. <h4>Nova + Zeta</h4> End board: Herald with 2+ negates, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Linkuriboh and Megalith Och <ol>  	<li>Activate Nova to SS Alpha and link into Linkuriboh.</li>  	<li>Activate Alpha to tribute Zeta and search Benten.</li>  	<li>Activate Zeta to tribute Benten, searching the Ritual Spell and Diviner of the Heralds.</li>  	<li>NS Diviner, sending Arc Light to search Phul.</li>  	<li>RS Phul tributing Alpha, activating it to return Benten to the hand.</li>  	<li>Return the Ritual Spell to hand and RS Och with Phul's effect, tributing Benten. Don't do these in the same chain in case you get Nibiru'd.</li>  	<li>CL1 Och, CL2 Benten, searching Herald of Ultimateness (if you don't have it) or Eva (if you do).</li>  	<li>Get a free draw off Och and discard Ultimateness.</li>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Crystal Wing.</li>  	<li>Link Tzolkin + Linkuriboh into Union Carrier, since both are DARK.</li>  	<li>Activate Union Carrier to equip either Eva, Gamma, or whatever you want in the GY to itself, bringing its ATK to 2000.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness using Union Carrier.</li>  	<li>Activate Eva in the GY, banishing Diviner &amp; Arc Light to search two Herald negates.</li> </ol> If you already drew Eva, you can summon Power Tool Dragon instead and summon Herald with it, after using its effect, then equip <a data-name=""B-Buster Drake"">B-Buster Drake</a> to Herald to give it spell immunity.  If you drew the above but also Benten and another Fairy, you can tribute the first Benten with Alpha to search a second and a Herald of Orange Light (for protection from Nibiru), then tribute the second with Zeta to go into Diviner as normal. <h4>Nova + Zeta + Gamma</h4> End board: Herald with 2+ Negates, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Linkuriboh, Union Carrier and I:P Masquerena.  Proceed as above, but discard Gamma instead of Ultimateness in step 8: <ol>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual Spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Crystal Wing.</li>  	<li>Link Tzolkin + Linkuriboh into Union Carrier, since both are DARK.</li>  	<li>Activate Gamma, tributing Ultimateness SS itself and Alpha. Take note on zone placement, ideally Union Carrier should be above the 1000 ATK Zeta.</li>  	<li>Equip Eva to Gamma if you didn't draw it.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness with Gamma, activating Eva's effect if necessary.</li>  	<li>Link into I:P Masquerena with Zeta and Och.</li> </ol> On your opponent's turn, you can activate Linkuriboh's effect tributing the Alpha on field, or you can make a 3-material Apollousa with I:P, Union Carrier and Alpha. <h4>Nova + Zeta (Going Second)</h4> End board: Number 77: The Seven Sins, Herald of Ultimateness, Linkuriboh, Draitron Zeta  Proceed as in the going first Nova + Zeta combo, but keep Ultimateness in hand and discard something else in step 8.  Hopefully you have already turned off your opponent's board with Dark Ruler No More. <ol>  	<li>SS Ultimaya Tzolkin with Diviner &amp; Phul.</li>  	<li>Set the Ritual spell to activate Tzolkin's effect, SS Power Tool Dragon.</li>  	<li>Activate Power Tool's effect to search Execution of the Contract.</li>  	<li>Equip Execution to Och, using its effect to reveal the Ultimateness in hand and make it level 12.</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number 77 with Tzolkin and Och.</li>  	<li>RS Ultimateness with Power Tool Dragon.</li>  	<li>Activate Number 77's effect to banish your opponent's board.</li> </ol> From here you can try to OTK or link into Union Carrier with Number 77 &amp; Linkuriboh to protect Ultimateness, etc. <h2>Side Deck</h2> It turns out there are a lot of great Fairy-type handtraps and floodgates as well as Kaijus that work well with Draitron: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: Draitrons lock us out of Special Summoning monsters that can be normal summoned, like most of the Kaijus. Since Lava Golem cannot be Normal Summoned, it is perfect for tributing your opponent's board, although it does lock us out of our Normal Summon for that turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a>: A powerful floodgate searchable off of Benten that prevents your opponent from Special Summoning. Side this in against decks with lots of Kaiju-based removal or if you know your opponent cannot out it. You can get a second Tribute off of Benten by summoning it then tributing it for this card, so with a good hand it's also possible to make this card immune to Dark Ruler No More like we would for Herald.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: Instantly shuts down any deck that must banish unless they can negate it. This includes common engines like Invoked, Phantom Knights, and anything running <a data-name=""Gren Maju Da Eiza"">Gren Maju Da Eiza</a>. And it's searchable off of Benten!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Gnomaterial"">Gnomaterial</a>: Unfortunately EARTH attribute and so isn't searchable, but only needs to discard itself to make one of your opponent's monsters unusable for Link, Fusion, etc material. If you can resolve this against an opponent's Halqifibrax or another combo piece they needed to get rid of into the GY, you can sometimes simply end their combo. Also very good in mirror matches--use it against your opponent's Alpha summoned with Nova, and they'll have no way to get it off the field to use its effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Backrow hate.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Card Advance"">Card Advance</a>: Probably unnecessary but useful if running Vanity's Ruler. If you chain Phul's effect to summon Och to this, you can stack the top of your deck and then choose whether to draw off the top or shuffle first when the chain with Och and Benten starts. This gives you the potential to summon Ruler and still combo after as well as drawing any 1 of the 5 cards on top of your deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a>: Mostly good against Fusion or Pendulum-based decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a>: We're not running any Traps and this can stop Trap-based decks like Eldlich or Altergeist in their tracks. You could also run <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> instead.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> Thank you for reading my first attempt at a deck article! I love this archetype and Ritual archetypes in general, and I hope that you enjoy playing the deck as much as I have. Hopefully Diviner finally gets imported to the TCG by the time Draitron come out so that we can see how well they perform against the meta!  There are a few other cards I considered including, namely <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, because it can be summoned easily with Och, but this build is what I've found to the most consistent at playing first or second and I'd rather not cut some of the handtraps/handtrap protection for it."

Card destruction and draw power.,"This deck utilizes 3 main engines to fuel your draw power to reach you scales and monsters.  The deck runs the Spellbook draw Engine 2 x Spellbook Magician of Prophecy, 2 x Spellbook of Secrets, and 1 copy of Spellbook of Knowledge. This is the correct ratio as you are effectively running 4 searchers for knowledge and the duplicate searcher you end with can be sent for cost of knowledge.  The magician engine  Double Iris Magician x1 (duh hes limited) -  1x  Harmonizing Magician - 1x Purple Poison Magician -  1x Dragonpit Magician -  1x Performapal Celestial Magician  With all the searching power this deck has you only need one copy of each. Purple is the best low scale to have after using the searches from Servant of Endymion and Reflection The Damage boost eff procs the destruction effect.  Harmonizing in hand searches Dragon pit for the level 7 xyz or whatever magician you need most  Double iris is really here since its searchable off of duelist alliance since he's technically a pendulum dragon.  &nbsp;  2x Pendulum Calling - 2x Duelist Alliance The searching as mentioned above.  Pendulum Calling is great for unclogging parts of your hand.  It can setup your time pendulumograph.  Duelist alliance searches your pen call, double iris or time pendulumograph.  &nbsp;  Endymion Engine. Servant of Endymion - 3x Spell power mastery - 3x Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic - 3x Magical Abductor - 2x Mythical Beast Jackal King  Abductor is really versatile here.  He can search your boss monster or Jackal for Negate.  Abductor on the field can search for your magicans soul.  Generic Draw  3x Allure of Darkness - 1x Into the Void - 1x Upstart Goblin  Magicians engine  3x magicians soul - 2x magicians restage - 1x magicians right hand.  Souls is so good it is a body and unbricks your hands.  Restage I'm running at two since the inclusion of the other magician engine reduces the effectiveness of this.   Restage is a great extender. Magicians right hand is yet another negate.  Extenders: Magicans Restage - instant fusion - magicians souls - Selene  restage is a very good extender.  Brings back out souls or blue boi.   Say you dont have 2 spells to burn for magicians soul. you can link it off do some combos and bring it back with selene to pop cards in your hand/field.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Extra deck.  Millennium-Eyes Restrict -  Drawing instant fusion almost essentially guarantees your board and can be recycled by selene  Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon. - free negates and recycles your pendulums in the extra  Abyss Dweller - With the prevalence of GY strategies its a good include but Ill side it out for Tornado Dragon to deal with backrow decks  Timestar magician - Decent body good protection for your scales and can recycle your pendulums  Apollosua Bow of the Goddess - Great negation Great arrows what else do you want  Crowley, the first propheseer - starter for the spellbook engine  Daybreaker the Shinging Magical Warrior - its effect is okay the spell counter can be useful and its a decent target for selene to link climb  I:P masquerena - Super versatile great link into unicorn on your opponents turn for more disruption.  Ningirsu the world chalice warrior - none targeting, non destruction removal for dragoon.  Saryuja Skull dread - Extender and can unbrick hands, honestly could be cut for another copy of selene His issue is if it gets handtrapped you burnt a lot of resources into him.  2x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians. - Honestly one of the best xtras for pendulum.  Its an extender with great arrows.  It can summon souls to field or restrict, or any combo piece in your gy.  The spell counters can enable synergy with the rest of the Endymion cards.  Side board  This is the area with the least amount of testing so far. for decks to break large boards you can side out the spellbook engine for the Sphere mods and the nibiru or dark ruler no more.  And honestly dark ruler no more is just b/c forbidden droplets is expensive. Duster and reboot for backrow decks.  Mystic Mine :)  prankratops is  good value and versatile.  Tornado is good if you are siding out the spell book engine you can side out the link monster.  Though for game 2 if you are going second and you sided out the spellbook engine.  Crowley can be good handtrap bait."

If your opponent only summons one monster on their first turn, you can sacrifice it for Gameciel and automatically win by attacking Gameciel with every numeron gate. You can also replace Zexal with whatever if it gets banned."

Koa'ki Meiru monsters seem odd, but thanks to Adaman support and Doki Doki, they're incredibly easy to hit the field, with a simple maintenance cost for some decent negates, or simply level 4 targets for synchro summoning.  First deck list, so criticism welcome.  It's more for the casual level, despite the Adamancipator's appearance here, with a stronger focus on the Fossils."
