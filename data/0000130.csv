This deck has many options in terms of how you approach your plays and has been a really fun deck to use. It's easy to learn as well, with a explanation of how to do certain combos to ensure a good win.  &nbsp;  For the barrier statue combo going first, you only need 2 out of these 3 cards, Misc, Oviraptor and or/ Babycerasaurus, you can use fossil dig to get the other card you need, or another card like a Kaiju to pop a monster if you have all 3. You'll need Fossil Dig if you don't have Oviraptor or Misc, but the deck is pretty consistent with draws, so there shouldn't be an issue, unless you draw into Barrier Statue, which is the garnet of the deck. First, you need to summon Souleating Oviraptor, get either Babycerasaurus or  Miscellaneousaurus (whichever one you don't have) , send Miscellaneousaurus to the GY, protecting your dinos in the process, and banish it to special summon Animadorned Archosaur, use that card to pop Babycerasaurus, to not only get a Double Evolution Pill, but also to summon another Babycerasaurus. Use Souleating Oviraptor to destroy the special summoned Babycerasaurus, to bring back the other Babycerasaurus in the GY, and use the floating effect to special summon Giant Rex. Then, Link Summon Linkuriboh using Animadorned Archosaur, then go into Reprodocus, by using either Giant Rex Or Babycerasaurus, but DON'T use Souleating Oviraptor, keep that on the field. After bringing out Reprodocus, pause and use your Double Evolution Pill, Banish Giant Rex and Linkuriboh (or any other non-Dinosaur), then bring out Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, and since Giant Rex was Banished, you can Special Summon it to the field, and then by using the Souleating Oviraptor still on the field and Giant Rex, you can go into either Evolzar Dolkka, Laggia or any other R4nk you choose. Use the Reprodocus to change the monster it's pointing to, to change it to Winged-Beast, then use the Reprodocus and the monster it's pointing to, bring out Simorgh, Bird Of Sovereignty, which will allow you to bring out Barrier Statue Of The Stormwinds at the end. If done correctly, at the end phase your board should look like this:  <img class="""" src=""https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/771109076989378571/788413031461421066/epic_moment_2.PNG"" alt="""" width=""785"" height=""333"" />  Now, you have a board which negates most special summons with Barrier Statue and a card to protect it from being targeted by card effects, a Solemn Strike on legs to protect your board and a UTC to help you whittle your opponent's LP away.  If going 2nd, you could bring out a Pentestag to use alongside UCT's Flip-Face Down effect, allowing for a surefire win if done well, but going 2nd is mostly the same.  &nbsp;  With the True Kings, you can use either Dogoran or Miscellaneousaurus to bring out True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher, or if you're trying to bring out True King Lithosagym, the Disaster you could use Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon to bring it out and then combo off the effects of those to possibly bring out to Level 4's to bring out a R4nk or Pentestag. You could go into VFD with the True Kings, possibly with a UCT and Evolzar, you have a surefire OTK.  &nbsp;  The other cards in the main deck are the ever reliable PSY-Framegear Gamma and Frame Driver combo, a great hand trap for the format, along with a Pankratops, easily searchable by many cards in this deck, allowing for you to not only pop your opponent's card but also set up the GY for a Double Evolution Pill or Misc Special Summon. Harpie's Feather Duster, Terraforming and Monster Reborn are great extra tech options to help out with your combos. There's Red Reboot as well, a very useful handtrap which has come in handy many times for me, so I've added it here.  &nbsp;  The Extra deck has some R4nk cards you could go into, Tornado Dragon can be Summoned even with Barrier Statue, so it's great for removing backrow and allowing you to Special Summon again if things go sour, and Abyss Dweller, a great floodgate for the GY. Of course, there's Evolzar Laggia and Dolkka, staple XYZ's for any Dino deck, along with VFD, a very powerful card currently in this format. Secure Gardna is great LP protection and Pentestag is a great Link-2 when combined with UCT. Knightmare Phoenix of course, to help with any S/T and allowing you to go +1 in the proccess. There's the Linkuriboh, Reprodocus and Simorgh combo of course, but as well is PSY-Framelord Omega, which I've found to be very useful to bring back banished cards, which this deck does quite a bit, and is easily summoned with Gamma and Driver.  &nbsp;  In terms of the side deck, you have the usual suspects, S/T removal with Cosmic Cyclone, as Eldlich is very popular right now, banishing S/T is better than simply popping backrow in certain situations, Nibiru, Ghost Ogre and Droll for your Hand Traps, all have worked well in this deck, and Survivals' End, which if used along with Lost World and Juraegg Tokens brought out by it, can not only get you R4nk or Link Material, it also can destroy one of your cards and one from your opponent's side too. You can use it to combo off with Babycerasaurus possibly brought out by Oviraptor, getting more fodder out, but can also be a good option to get rid of your opponent's cards too, with the benefit of you setting up your field and or GY.  &nbsp;  Overall, this has been a really fun deck to play, with many options with how you can approach your duel, with the benefit of being easy to learn and master the many combos here. I've been using this deck and have had some good success with it, and will continue to use it in the future. As the great Farfa once said:  &nbsp;  <span>BRRRRRRRRRR DINO MONSTER WHEEE SPECIAL SUMMON SPECIAL SUMMON SPECIAL SUMMON</span>  &nbsp;  fin.  &nbsp;  (Thanks to LifeHacks for teaching me the barrier statue combo, he helped me build this deck, so check his stuff out here:  https://ygoprodeck.com/author/lifehacks/ )"

I thought they could make a good synergy together so i thought, hey it could be my first hybrid deck here and one of the few I love. Time to analyze!  The deck, as mentioned before, is a hybrid featuring Eldlich and Dogmatika. I am going to have to do a lot of explaining so first things first the dogmatika part. Dogmatika focuses on making your opponents extra deck useless and sometimes at the cost of your own, meaning it is great against extra deck reliant decks like many combo decks and some control nowadays. Ecclessia is here because she is easy to summon + an add and a protection on her, definetely a 3-off. Fleur-de-lis is easy to summon in an optimal matchup and can negate a face up card making him a solid 2. Maximus is here to mill the opponents extra deck to stop their combos while giving you some advantage with options I will talk about later. Nadir is an easy add with no drawback for the deck so a definite 3. Nation is here for added protection, milling when it leaves and making your dogmatika monsters unbeatable in battle against the extra deck. Albaz is here to fuse into Titaniklad( or Bastard if you will), essentially acting as a super poly. Punishment is here to destroy annoying beatsticks by tossing some fat bois from the extra deck.  Now the Eldlich part. Edlich is the center of the synergy so you want to run 3 at all times as he mostly wont be a brick in such a spell/trap heavy deck. Now the eldixirs:White Fate at 2 as it can be bricky if you havent already summoned or yeeted Eldlich in the GY. Black Awakening is great as it summons him from the Deck. Same goes for Scarlet Saguine as well. All the eldixirs let you set Golden Land Traps from the deck when you banish them from the GY. What are these you ask? Well to put it simply they are traps that when activated are summoned as monsters with their own stats and level. If you have Eldlich on the field they can activate their own individual effects when summoned. Conquistador pops a card making him a great 3. Huaquero banishes a card from the GY, useful to stop combos and handtraps but can be kinda bricky in situations when dont need to banish anything. Guardian makes a monsters attack 0, but it is useless against decks with unaffected monsters or spell and trap reliant ones. Can be good to get rid off an annoying beatstick.On a reverse situation, Golden Land Traps except the one I am going to mention now can banish themselves from the GY to set an Eldixir from the deck. Golden Land Forever! is your counter trap that can negate anything at the cost of Eldlich or one of the Golden Land Traps in their monster form. Finally Cursed El Dorlando is another way to add mainly Eldlich and has great synergy with him, as you can use his effect to pop it and trigger the floating effect of Dorlando.  The extra deck features Titaniklad, which you will be summoning with Albaz. N'tss for when it is yeeted from there to pop something on the field. Skull knight you can banish from the GY to pop a monster. These two are your primary targets for Maximus, Nation and anything that tosses them in the GY. Gangaridai and Superdimensional boi are great xyz to go into as a plan B with Eldich as material. The latter is a great target for the aforementioned punishment as it has a 5000 atk chonk.  This is the deck! I hope you like it! Now go out there and show em that the Heavens and the Golden Land ain't gonna ignore any corruption and sin!"

And I was like ""hey, that sounds like a fun build to make with the new OCG support"", so I made it. The OCG support actually helps a lot with field swarming without many restrictions, and going into more usable Synchros. We also have a frog engine for the boy Toadally, since he's now unlimited (I can hear Rata sobbing). So here it is. God save my soul. Update: I beat True Draco with this. This deck is actually surprisingly strong for Ice Barrier. <span>Deck guide <span>1x Grunard- Grunard helps in part with field swarming, as you can easily get out more Ice Barrier's with his effect, which is helpful due to the slowness of the archetype. Though, some new support makes up for it, so you may want to side him out in some match ups. He's also a 28k body and a level 8 for synchros. </span></span>2x Gantala- Gantala was originally the best card of the archetype, before we got the new, actually usable support. Gantala is still a solid monster, even if he's been powercrept by the new support. He allows you to revive more Ice Barriers from the grave, which also helps to make up for the lack of field swarming. Although, it happens int he end phase, making it a bit slow. He's also a 27k body and a level 7 for synchros. 2x Raiho- Raiho is the deck's main source of negates, and fairly solid ones at that. Every single monster effect they try to activate is negated, unless they discard a card from hand. This makes it so your opponent has to dump their entire hand to the grave just to play, including the cards they dont want to dump (because not everything has a graveyard effect) and makes Raiho a hand rip and negate in one, putting your opponent into a tight position. Raiho's also a fairly mediocre 21k body and a level 6 for synchros. 3x Wayne- Wayne is another new support card that's amazing for field swarming. As long as your opponent controls a monster and you control a Ice Barrier, you can special summon him, which is great for going second. On summon, he searches an Ice Barrier spell (as there's no Ice Barrier traps, but he mentions Ice Barrier traps in the text oddly enough), which is great for more set up. And on legs, he's a Macro Cosmos for spells/traps, which can cripple some decks like Sky Strikers. 3x Mirror Master- Mirror Master's first effect, the tribute one, is pretty useless, although it does stop God decks and Monarchs, so that's nice. It's second effect, though, is great. It can discard a card to summon an Ice Barrier tuner from deck, most likely Frost Spirit (who we'll get into later), for an easy and powerful synchro. And in the grave, if an Ice Barrier would send a card from hand for an effect (AKA mirror master lol), it can banish itself from grave instead, making using Mirror Master easier. 3x Miko- Miko's first effect is pretty useless, although it can do stuff with like, enemy controller or something lol. Although it's other effects are pretty solid; it allows you to special summon it if you control an Ice Barrier, making for easy field swarming. It also allows you to banish itself from grave to summon a token to your field, which can be used for more plays like tributing the Generals out or something like that. 3x Defender- Defender is, not great. It's stun effect is slow and easy to out. It's only really played because it's a tuner. In some situations, though, it's stun effect can be of use. 2x Cryomacer- similar to Defender, Cryomancer has a slow and bad stun effect that's only really useful in some situation's. Cryomancer is mainly just played for being a Tuner. In some situations, though, it's stun effect could be of use. 2x Attendant- Attendant is solid for getting out the larger General's, as it tributes itself to summont hem from hand. Although, Attendant tends to eat up your normal summon and requires them to be in your hand at the time, which means it's best off at 2. And in the grave, it can reduce the level of a face up water by 2 to special summon itself. This effect can be a bit awkward but still useful for recurring resources. In a higher level focused build, Attendand's better at 3. 3x Frost Spirit- The main tuner of the deck that you want to focus on and summon off of Mirror Master. Frost Spirit's first effect is pretty useless, as you won't be leaving it on the field. It's intended purpose is to summon it out quickly, as it's a great tuner. It can send a level 3 or lower Ice Barrier from the deck to copy it's level, helping for a lot of Synchro plays and giving Gantala some fodder. While the level restriction is a bit too low for my taste, it can still climb nicely and help to fit the situation at hand. He's also adorable. Just look at him! 3x Swap Frog- Swap Frog is another great card for special summoning, as he sets up your graveyard for more Gantala plays and the such, and gets himself out easily. Frog also can load up your graveyard even more with more restrictions on summon, and is one of the main routes into Toadally, as he lacks a once per turn on his special summoning. 2x Ronin- Ronin is another piece of the Frog engine, as you can banish a lost Swap frog to easily special him out and overlay into Toadally with ease. Like Swap, he lacks a once per turn, making him easy to abuse. I also love his art and general style. 3x Ash- The deck's main staple hand trap. Nearly any modern deck searches, so Ash can negate that part of a combo and cripple it, or stop it all together, which is great for a single card. 3x Magic Triangle- Magic Triangle helps to get out even more monsters with ease in case you have a bricky hand, although it's restrictions are a bit tough. 3 might be a bit too high, so if you prefer you can play 2. 3x Medallion- Medallion is a great card for the archetype, as it's an archetypal rota to search out any monster you need to fill up the gaps in your hand. It also lacks a once per turn, making it easy to abuse. 2x Magic Triangle- Magic Triangle is the archetype's monster reborn, being quite helpful for recovering monsters and resources late game. It also helps for if you have a large board set up (somehow), as it protects all your Ice Barrier's from Extra Deck monster effects, which are very plentiful in the modern game. <span>The extra deck <span>2x Trishula, Subzero- A new version of Trishula, with a badass name, as shortening it to Trishula, Subzero sounds badass. Subzero clears out the opponent's field when going second, as it banishes 3 cards and can easily remove problem monsters/spells without targeting, which is amazing in the current game. And on destruction, Subzero summons the original Trishula from your extra deck (without negating it's effects or anything), boosts it's attack to 3300, halves the attack of all your opponent's monsters, and negates their effects. All this is permanent. It's god damn amazing, as it gives you a huge beater in Trishula with even more removal and hand ripping paired with Subzero. 1x Trishula- Trishula is still limited, sadly, but still great. Trish can rip a card from hand, field and grave, which is great for crippling the opponent's plays and their field. Although, this is only on summon, and just leaves you with a 27k beater. Subzero completely makes up for it though, as it gives you even more banishing removal without targeting, and boosts the attack of your Trishula to high levels and cripples the opponent's monsters, making Trish even easier to use. 1x Gungnir- Gungnir is another great source of removal, that's much easier to get out than Trish and Subzero. Gungnir can discard up to two cards to target that many cards your opponent controls, and destroy them. While it does target, which is a pain, Mirror Master helps with the effect and Gungnir is a nice 25k body. </span></span>  1x Brionac- Brionac is similar to Gungnir. A level 6 Synchro, like him, he does basically the same thing, but he bounces the cards instead of destroying, which can be much better in a lot of situations due to destruction effects. Aditionally, Brionac is on a 23k body, which is a bit weaker than Gungnir. 1x Dewloren- Another limited Ice Barrier synchro, as they're surprisingly powerful, even in the first wave.Dewloren can bounce opponent's cards to the hand easily to get them out of the way, and gains 500 attack for each until the end phase, which can make him a huge beater depending on the board. 2x Coral Anenome- Coral is a link-2 that's mainly used for climbing into Reef, mid- to late game, as it can revive Ice Barriers from grave to provide more Link fodder and help to link climb into Bubble Reef to finish off the game. Her second effect, though, is pretty useless. 2x Great Bubble Reef- Great Bubble Reef is a great (see what I did there?) alternative boss monster option. It's a nice link-4 that can banish Water's from grave to draw, and when it does so it gains another 600 attack on top of it's starting point of 26k, meaning it can grow into a fairly high beater to close off the game mid- to late game. 3x Toadally- Finally unlimited! Rata is mad. Anyway, Toadally helps to swarm the field with some more frogs, although it's not super notable as this deck doesn't use tons of frogs. It's second effect is more notable though, as it's one of the deck's few negates, although it does rely on you having some frogs. Aditionally, it allows you to recur your resources on it's destruction. 1x Bahamut- Bahamut is another way of getting out Toadally, instead of relying on level 2's. Bahamut can easily summon out Toadally, which is quite nice for swarming the field and such. I'm not going to make a big title for it, but we have a single side deck card- Dance Princess. She's basically an archetypal Trunade on legs that can cripple decks like Altergeist so, she's there. <span>Playing guide <span>The deck's main focus is to swarm out the field as much as possible, and do two of either things; Get out the generals, get out the Synchros, or both. You want to start off with Medallion and Triangle if you have them, to begin your plays. Afterwards, you summon out the main Ice Barrier you want on the field, most likely Mirror or Attendant. Then you can either tribute Attendant to get out a big General, or use Mirror's effect to get out a tuner. You can go into the large synchros for their strong effects from there, and if you can, try and get out a general or two with some of the special summoning conditions from the effects. The deck can't really end the game on turn 1, so afterwards it becomes more of a grind game of using the General's to grind for resources and getting our more Synchros for their high impact effects, until you can finish off the game. Along the way, you can also make a Bahamut/Toadally for extra negates, and a Bubble Reef to help finish off the game faster. </span><span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Have a good day! </span> </span>"

Made famous after taking 2nd place at YCS Portland, I would not be surprised to see the deck get a few more tops soon (even if they are only in pro level online tournaments).  The key to this deck is to break your opponents board and turbo out Gren Maju for the OTK. Gizmek Orochi, Pot Of Desires and Golden Castle are key to this ability to turbo, you can banish most of the deck in your first turn.  The handtrap lineup I feel is currently the best it can be for the deck. Dimension Shifter is an amazing card that essentially gives you a free turn against most meta decks, whilst Psyframe Gamma was included purely to stop the opponent from disrupting often key effects such as Stormberg's summon from deck and the draw off of desires. I have also included Psyframelord Omega in the side, which can be used to rip a card from the opponents hand. This effect is useful for when forced to go first or if you cannot quite facilitate the OTK on your turn. Gamma is also pretty decent in general to disrupt the opponents plays on their turn too.  Treble Super Poly and Dark Ruler No More are both included, for the simple that you will want to see at least one against pretty much every meta deck out there in order to make your plays safer and board break at the same time.  The extra deck is pretty flexible. A decent enough array of Super Poly targets, N'tiss to punish Dogmatika, Omega for hand ripping and also allowing you to use Gamma again instead of it being a virtual dead draw after turn one. And finally Dingirsu, Hope Harbinger and Sanaphond arguably the best rank 8's in the game, period. The last 3 slots are arguably the most flexible slots.  The side deck is mainly floodgates for going first. TCBOO and Dimensional Barrier have amazing overlap with eachother. Draitrons rely on ritual mechanics, Virtual World relying on Synchros, Zoodiacs rely on XYZ's do D-Barrier is very effective against them. Whilst TCBOO stops decks with one main typing, while also having some overlap with D-Barrier for certain engines. Macros is there to keep a permanent state of banishing, which often forces the opponent to either use resources to remove it or they lose. Imperial Order is used to stop very spell dependent decks, although it can stop things like the protection effect of Stormberg, if i'm using it it means it'll hurt the opposition more than me. Plus it doesn't stop Stormberg's mandatory banish cost, which still helps Gren Maju/Eater Of Millions facilitate OTK's.

Also, quick question: Have you read Misc?","  So the December 2020 TCG Banlist was revealed recently, and as it turns out...Miscellaneousaurus did not get hit! So my favorite deck is still at full power! UCT is still da real MVP!  This deck's name is a reference to one of my older Dinosaur decks, ""UCT Is MVP!"" (Link: https://ygoprodeck.com/uct-is-mvp/)  Anyways, unlike it's inspiration, this deck doesn't use one of the most degenerate Link 2s ever. *fake cough* Halqifibrax. So this is basically your typical competitive Dino deck. While it does do good going first, it would be in your best interest to go second due to backrow removal being used in the Main Deck. Not to mention the 9 hand traps.  &nbsp;  In case you're wondering why Knightmare Cerberus is in the main deck, it's because if you manage to summon Gamma and Driver (or a monster in addition to Nibiru) going second with Lost World on the field, you can use both monsters to link summon Knightmare Cerberus, and use its effect on one of your opponent's Tokens. Then you can use Lost World's final effect to destroy a Baby or Petit in your hand/Deck instead. So I put Cerberus in the Extra Deck so I can destroy Baby or Petit with Lost World as often as possible.  &nbsp;  And finally, because I'm just a petty little *BLEEP!*, I side-decked Mystic Mine."

And you already know that it's a Traptrix deck that uses the two new support cards they got in Lightning Overdrive.  Traptrix Ginalloa, their new Effect Monster, can Special Summon herself from the hand by sending one of your set Traps to the Graveyard. And if your backrow is empty, she can banish herself from the Graveyard to set a Trap Hole from your Graveyard. Unfortunately, you can only use one of these two effects per turn. While this con is a bit of a hinderance, Ginalloa is still good enough to run at at least 2 copies. Thanks to her Special Summoning effect, I've been able to win with Borrelsword on later turns of duels!  &nbsp;  As for the Link 2, Traptrix Utricularia is also pretty good. Once per turn, you can reset one of your activated Trap Holes instead of sending it to the Graveyard. This effect synergizes well with Ginalloa if she was Special Summoned by her effect. After pitching one of your Traps to summon Ginalloa, you can use her and another Traptrix to summon Ultricularia, whose first effect can stop you from losing one of your Trap Holes. Her second effect is also pretty good, allowing you to Special Summon a Traptrix from the Graveyard during your End Phase. One of the best monsters to summon with this is Dionaea, whose effect sets a Trap Hole from your Graveyard, which you can then use on your opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  Traptrix Nation, as a deck, functions as you expect a Traptrix deck to. It's either go first or burst. Although if you want to go on the offensive, this deck uses a Utopia Double engine, in addition to Borrelsword Dragon."

The deck is just basic Noble and Infernoble Knight bread and butter that goes into Isolde and using her effect to dump cursed bamboo to the graveyard and search off any of the other bamboo swords. Burning Bamboo will allow you to skip your opponent's main phase 1 if you activate another bamboo sword card on the field. Retrieving the Cursed Bamboo from the GY can be done with  Renaud's effect from the hand. Searching for the Cursed Bamboo can be done with Glory of the Noble Knights as well.  &nbsp;  This is just a fun gimmick that I worked on recently so I'll continue looking to make more changes, feel free to give any suggestions of any changes you'll add.  Here's a link of test hand example of what the basic combo is : https://youtu.be/YsEvCAXljRI"

The second effect is to special summon spellcasters when it gets attacked, also the attacking monster's atk is halfed then. This is a good defense, because if you have a 2000-Atk-spellcaster in the graveyard, the opponent has to attack with more than 4000. When you have a spellcaster in the graveyard there are more ways to make use of it, because you normally won't get attacked to spawn the spellcasters for free. <ul>  	<li> <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> or <a data-name=""Call of The Haunted"">Call of The Haunted</a> as the fastest way</li>  	<li>You can fusion summon them from the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> can Special Summon <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a> and V<a data-name=""essel Miko Of the Ice Barrier"">essel Miko Of the Ice Barrier</a> when he gets special summoned, because they are Water-level-4-Monsters and <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> gets special summoned by it's own effect when a spellcaster gets targeted by a card-effect. <a data-name=""Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier"">Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier</a> can also be special summoned with <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> which can special summon water monsters with 1500 atk or less from the graveyard.</li> </ul> <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> – A good Support card to get more monsters on the field for Link- and synchro-summons, If you can not synchro-, link-, or fusion-summon then you normally wouldn't play <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>, so he is best to play when you already have a monster on the field, to then get at least a <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> or some other good effect-monster.  <a data-name=""Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier"">Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier</a> – It has an effect that just slows the opponent a bit down, because the battle positions can't be changed, but it also can get special summoned with an Ice Barrier Monster on the field. You also can get a level-1-Token if it is in the graveyard, that is an Ice-barrier-Card and triggers other Ice-Barrier-Effects, and which can also be used for Synchro- and Link-Summons.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> – It can be used to summon very fast Link- and Synchro-Summons. With it's effect it can either Summon another <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> or a <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a>. When you get the <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> you get a Level-4-Water-Monster from the Graveyard, also you can then Synchro-summon <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>, to synchro-summon even further with a a card from the Hand. In both cases you can also Link-summon the cards for <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>.  <a data-name=""Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a> – A level-3-tuner that can be special summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> from the deck or with <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> from the Graveyard, and which has an effect that stops the opponent from attacking if you have another Ice-Barrier-Monster, but it's easy to play around that effect, so it's a secondary option. With a level-4-Monster you get <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, but it's only good if you want to fusion- or link- summon <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> again or if you have to destroy 2 cards, because he has only 400 atk after you destroyed 2 cards, you can use him as a level-7 card for <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> to trigger the immunities, or you can link or tribute him, and fusion him later with <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> – Can special summon a level-4-Water-Card (with negated effects) from the graveyard when he gets special summoned by <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a>, It is also good to get <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>.  <a data-name=""Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a> - A Good level-1-card that triggers other Ice-Barrier effects to special summon faster, and that can also be summoned with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>.  <a data-name=""General Wayne Of The Ice Barrier"">General Wayne Of The Ice Barrier</a> – Can also get special summoned with another Ice-Barrier-monster, but only when the opponent has a monster, and it can get <a data-name=""Medallion of The Ice Barrier"">Medallion of The Ice Barrier</a> from the deck if you summon it. It is also a level-5 card to synchro summon level-7, level-8, or level-10 cards easier.  <a data-name=""Medium Of The Ice Barrier"">Medium Of The Ice Barrier</a> – It can be special summoned wen the opponent has 4 more cards then you on the field, and it is also a spellcaster that can be put into the graveyard and be special summoned later, because this is better than to pay the two tributes. If it is on the field the opponent can only activate one spell/trap-card per turn, and as a level-7 card it is good to get a level 10-synchro-summon.  <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a> – Good effect that gives other spellcasters an immunity of getting targeted, and it also can destroy a face up card by discarding a spell which is in the best case <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a> because you can get it back. It is also a level-7 Card as a synchro-material.  <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> – Level 7 and higher spellcasters can not be destroyed by card effects with this card on the field, which are <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>, <a data-name=""Medium Of The Ice Barrier"">Medium Of The Ice Barrier</a>, <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a>. If it gets destroyed you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> for fusion-summons, and if it's in the graveyard then or in the hand it can special summon itself when a spellcaster gets targeted by a card-effect, but it does not negate the effect.  <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> – It can be used to fusion summon <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and it gets special summoned by <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a>'s effect and by the effect of the <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> fusion, which improves the stall-capabilities a bit.  Extra-Deck:  Link:  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>, <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - </a><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Soldier of Chaos</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> –  there are 3 Link-2 Monsters, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> is only used to get <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, it's not cheap but the effect of <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> can be worth for only 2 effect monsters. <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> can special summon water monsters with 1500atk or less from the graveyard, this is good to get tuners back and synchro-summon then, but it only works for water summons, you can also get <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> back from the Graveyard if you want. <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> is also great to get a level 3 or a level 2 tuner from the deck, the level 3 tuner is also an ice barrier monster for the other ice barrier effects. The effect can be used to get <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a> in the opponent's turn, but then a defense is needed, so you can play <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> or <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a> to stall.  <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> is great because he gets immunity of being targeted and destroyed when you have a level 7 or higher card, you can use <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, or the Tokens of <a data-name=""Pacifis, The Phantasm City"">Pacifis, The Phantasm City</a> and <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a>, these summon again after they are destroyed, otherwise you can use <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> as the best target, or then the other spellcasters.  <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is the best defense when you got monsters on the field or when you special summoned some monsters, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> can attack any monsters and steal them with the effect, but as a defense you only have 3000 atk so a <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> can be more effective when you make him to a 4500-atk-monster with an immunity.  &nbsp;  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>, <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Stardust Spark Dragon"">Stardust Spark Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> -  <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> is only used with <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, together with a special summoned <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> otherwise a token or <a data-name=""Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a>, then you need to have a level-4, level-5 or level-7 card on then hand or on the field to summon the other synchro-monster's with the effect.  Coral Dragon can be summoned with Crystron Halqifibrax if you can stall one round, but it is alos worth it to just draw a card when you first summon Coral Dragon and then a level-10 or maybe level-7 or level-8 from it. Arcanite Magician can destroy 2 cards which is very good, and if you can get Predaplant Verte Anaconda in the same turn you can fusion him, otherwise it's good to link or tribute it after the effect.  Stardust Spark Dragon has a great defensive and stall effect, that protects one card from being destroyed, so you don't have to know which effect you have to negate, and you can also maybe counter more than one destroy effect.  <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> has great stall and gives you also tokens, but it is easy to destroy and has no immunities, so you want to have other cards together with it, then you can use it's effect better and special summon it from the graveyard when it gets destroyed.  &nbsp;  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a> -  <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> is an Aqua Monster like <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, and is best to stall attacks for the spellcasters because he must be targeted and can not be destroyed by battle.  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> can be summoned with the <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> that you can also get with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, and it is a level-1 monster that you can link or synchro then.  <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> can only be summoned when you have <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> in the graveyard or on the field, so you can maybe get her with <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> or discard her earlier with <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a>, then it is very easy to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, because you normally always have a spellcaster in the graveyard that you can use as the other material, It has no immunities so it is also better in combination with other cards, but you can draw cards and you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> back when it gets destroyes as a stall-effect.  <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a> can only be fusion summoned with <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, but you can also fusion it from the graveyard with only one other spellcaster if you have <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> already in the graveyard. He can also destroy 1 card or you can draw 1 card with it, but it can be used only 2 times and only once per turn, he also has more def than <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> for stalling.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a>, <a data-name=""Pot Of Duality"">Pot Of Duality</a>,  – The draw engine with defensive potential, you can get <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a> back if you have <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>, <a data-name=""Link burst"">Link burst</a> is a good combo with <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> even with link-2 monsters, and <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> is better than the other Pots, most of the time it is easy to stall one turn with traps and spells if you can not play it directly, because you can not special summon then.

Mid-Tempo control that can hold their own vs'ing the rampant popularity of Zoo Lich and Drytro,"List for the Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika for Dec 2020. Most notable change would be Artemis replacing Almiraj/Gardna, Aleister to 2, and an increase in Dogmatika lineup.  The list is only for the main deck - depending on the meta, you can main cards such as Skull Meister, and D.D Crow due to the increase in Eldlich variants running around and Drytrons. I would usually side Ice Dragon's Prison however it would be an amazing choice for the main deck too as it can easily out dragoon and an amazing trap card overall. With Infernobles and DL usage dying down, siding Nibiru might be a better meta call. With the deck being able to easily recover advantage by putting monsters on board using Invo/Schism to fusion summon and Dogma cards, siding Torrential Tribute also has been a great success for me. It can halt Virtual World/Drytron boards thats getting built. Side deck should include cards such as Artifact Lancea. Remember to take advantage of Ariel eff to banish 3 cards from GY - usually delays/stops active engines for Drytrons and Eldlich decks.  &nbsp;  If I were to change one thing, I may run 3 Construct and just 1 N'tss instead."

Well, that's only how it appears on first glance. The Live☆Twins provide an easy shell to give the deck a solid turn 1 play in the form of either of their Links, or a Rank 2 Xyz monster. To follow this up, various backrow is necessary to allow the deck to try and establish their loop involving both of the Evil★Twins, with cards like World Legacy Awakens, World Legacy Clash, Evil★Twin Challenge, and Mirror Force.  To fill the void in which things don't go according to plan, the deck is filled with a number of standalone monsters that can easily provide pressure until you can get the Twins going, sometimes even being able to just win on their own. Danger provides bonuses from being discarded by cards like the Knightmares, Paleozoic Dinomischus, and Live☆Twin Home, as well as being able to summon themselves from hand in a pinch. Dogmatika, on the other hand, provides solid value and beaters in the form of Dogmatika Fleurdelis and Dogmatika Theo, with Dogmatika Ecclesia being able to search both of them, with Albaz allowing you to punish DARK and high ATK decks, as well as activating the Danger effects by discarding them. After that, you get into singleton value cards like Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun serving as a beater and situational removal, Lady Debug allowing you to search monsters in a pinch, and Gussari @Ignister allowing you to punish your opponent for attacking over your Link monsters.  If you do get to looping the Evil★Twins, you're given access to rather solid wincons. The unique property of the Twins reviving the other as a quick-effect allows you to repeatedly send them to the GY via Tribute effects or Link materials to revive them and gain their on-summon effects. By doing this repeatedly, you can gain strong value off of the Knightmare monsters, which provide buffs and draws when co-linked and have a floodgate in the form of Knightmare Gryphon that can effectively stop your opponent in their tracks, while you can use cards like Zero-Day Blaster, Dark Factory of More Production and Cynet Regression to take advantage of the recursive quick revival.  In terms of value the prior cards are all very effective, but sometimes you just need a little bit more, which is why I have my own special techs to help bridge that gap. First on the list is Number 29: Mannequin Cat. Her effect allows you to punish a deck that Special Summons against you. Granted, you don't have targets for every Attribute, but you have them for the 2 most common Attributes, Light and Dark. Unfortunately, you don't always get to set up defensive plays, which is where Formud Skipper comes into play. By using his effects, you can Link for Appliancer Laundry Dragon, who can crash into an opponent's monster, destroy and burn your opponent for that monster's ATK, and then summon Gussary @Ignister from your hand due to its effect that searches it when its Linked off. Lastly, is my Rank 4 Xyz monster of choice in Light Dragon @Ignister. While Exciton may be a better card in terms of boardbreaking and comeback factory, Tornado Dragon to answer backrow, or even Castel/101 to deal with indestructible monsters, Light Dragon provides your monsters with protection from destruction via card effect, has non-targeting removal, but most importantly can be used with other Cyberse monsters to revive your Link monsters, along with the added bonus of being able to summon back Linguriboh by Tributing itself.  The side deck is much simpler to explain, as its just as it seems. A number of backrow removal Spells in their to try and make the matchup vs backrow/control decks not quite so painful along with Linkslayer, Kongreat and D.D. Crow to deal with GY focused decks or decks that send from deck/hand to GY like Rituals, Victoria and Electric Virus for the matchup vs Dragon decks like Dragonmaids, The Chaos Creator &amp; Chaos Space is try and not just lose to 1 of your Evil★Twins being banished, Chain Disappearance is specifically to banish 3 copies of Chamber Dragonmaid, Brain Control is to give a bit of solid ""removal"" vs decks that have strong maindeck monsters, and Degrade Buster is to face down high ATK decks.  And that about sums up the deck. If you can establish the Evil★Twin loops, the deck can snowball quite well. Even if it can't you can always fall back onto simple beatdown gameplay. If people want an in-depth guide regarding gameplay for the deck, I'll provide that in the future, but 'tis all for now."

Also, I love trap heavy decks.</span>  boss cards are <span><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a></span>  <b>Basic combo guide. </b><span> </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Invoked. <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> bring’s <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> normal summon Aleister the Invoker </span><span>to </span><span><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a></span><span> to <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a>. Then use <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> which you get from normal summoning Aleister the Invoker. To bring  <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Frog. </span><span><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> sends <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> from hand to sp himself, his effect sends <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to gy and <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> banishes <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> to sp himself. Then you make <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and you start looping and negating with him.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Play guide benefit’s downsides techs and overall strategy. </b>  &nbsp;  <b>Overall strategy and benefits</b>  <span>The basic strategy of this deck is to use the invoked engine to make their own resources and play off that and use the frog and Paleozoic to control the field. I tried to make this a slower deck than normal paleo frog which may sound weird but it's too fast when it comes to using resources. (my opinion) So by adding invoked I feel it cuts down on the resources spending. The reason I feel paleo frogs spent too many resources is they had to get more traps in their hand to stop the opponent swinging over them but if you get <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or bigger board’s it’s harder to do that.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Down side.</b>  <span>The downside to this deck is the Paleozoic side does not shine as much for the reason of not having as many traps. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Techs/and some strategy</b>  <span>So we have in the side deck <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires </a><a data-name=""Pot of Desires Pot"">Pot</a> of Avarice <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>, and last <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. Let’s get the <a data-name=""trap trick"">trap trick</a> out of the way. This is for people who like <a data-name=""trap trick"">trap trick</a> more than <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a>, so pick your favorite and take the one you do not like out. My top pick for the side deck card to replace it is <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> which is a good going second card for this deck because you most likely will never otk your opponent and negate boards can really hurt this deck. Next <a data-name=""pot of desire"">pot of desire </a>for people who like to run three swap it with what you would like and then do <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> again so you have a playset. For the first monster on the list, we got <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> which is good for keeping your opponent’s boards smaller if that becomes an issue. The second monster and last is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> which is a basic hand trap it is used if your opponent is comboing or searching too much. For the spell’s we got <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> Which I already explained. Next, we have <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> why not <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, well one reason Eldlich this deck is trap heavy and banishes their traps as cost also it’s popular. (other decks do it too so pay attention like this one). Last on the side decklist we got <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> which will help you out in a pinch see my friend <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> here needs frog monsters in the deck to work and long games with decks that are control or really fast can make you spend a lot of resources which you need to get back. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Going against different decks.</b>  <span>So let’s go with two different deck’s control and OTK EX: for control Salamangreat EX: for OTK sacred beasts. So going against sacred best’s you have to be very careful and preserve your resources so they don't power you and there is no coming back. Be patient and wait for a good moment to stun them and slowly you will take control and win. For a control deck, you want to play it slowly, wait for your moment to take control when they have no resources or you will find yourself on the other end of the table where you have no resources and you top decking. Combo decks are hard to combat because they make you spend your resources faster than you can sometimes make them.</span>  &nbsp;  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/paleofrogs-dec-2020/""><span>https://ygoprodeck.com/paleofrogs-dec-2020/</span></a><span> is the deck I was playing testing before I made this so you may see more similarities than normal because I was new to Paleozoic control. (not frog) but I do know my way around a trap heavy deck from playing chain burn. </span>"

One being they are light and dark and two, they interact with the banished zone and have 1 card which is really good at setting up said zone. This allows the deck to make great use of banished zone and use generic chaos support to make and extend plays. By adding in a small rokket engine which gives the deck access to both more link material and dark monsters to set it its graveyard, it allows S-force to make some surprisingly powerful boards and make use of some very powerful removal effects and annoying lock down effects.  &nbsp;  I will very likely update this deck when it receives later waves of support."

Finally, 1 <strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</strong> which searches a plant and is also a potential target for <strong>Gizmek Uka</strong>.  Mainly Spells in this deck and like half of them are for access to <strong>Loci</strong>. <strong>Painful Decision</strong>,<strong> Unexpected Dai</strong>, and<strong> Where Arf Thou?</strong> are there for <strong>Loci</strong> whereas <strong>Where Arf Thou?</strong> and <strong>One for One</strong> can search other lv1's. <strong>Sunvine Cross Breed</strong> and <strong>Sunvine Shrine</strong> are searchable extenders and <strong>Shrine</strong> is also a soft once per turn which could've been a hard once per turn and have changed nothing since its activation requirement it annoying. <strong>Pot of Avarice</strong> and <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> are for draw power and gaining advantage while <strong>Avarice</strong> is also a way to recycle your link-1 monsters. Your only trap is<strong> Sunavalon Bloom</strong> which is <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> and BP reassurance i guess.  Extra Deck. 3 <strong>Sunvine Thrasher</strong> which is a beater with its effect and it can yoink a monster that it destroys by battle. 3<strong> Sunavalon Dryas</strong> which searches your<strong> Sunvine</strong> Spell/Traps. 1<strong> Sunavalon Dryades</strong> which is just a Link-2 <strong>Dryanome</strong>.<strong> Sunavalon Dryanome</strong> doesn't need to be summoned during each of your combos, but it can be played with things like the burn from <strong>Gizmek Uka</strong> or the burn from<strong> Where Arf Thou?</strong>.  1 <strong>Sunavalon Dryatrentiay</strong> which is the monster you end with and it searches a <strong>Sunavalon Spell/Trap</strong>. 1 <strong>Sunavalone Daphne</strong> for desperate recycling if you don't have <strong>Avarice</strong>. 1 <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> whose role is linking off non-plants. 1 <strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong> as an extender. 1 <strong>Geonator Transverser</strong> for the gimmicky <strong>Uka</strong> play. 1 <strong>Strenae the Rikka Queen</strong> to make with <strong>eXceed</strong>. 1 <strong>Divine Treebeast High Peryton</strong> which is a target for <strong>Strenae</strong>.  Side Deck. 3 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>. 3 <strong>Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</strong> which does the gimmick with <strong>Geonator</strong> to spam <strong>Sunvines</strong> with the Link-2 or Link-3 <strong>Sunavalon</strong>. 1 <strong>Barrier Statue of the Torrent</strong> as an <strong>Uka</strong> target if ur opponent is playing <strong>Halq</strong>. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 1 <strong>Duster</strong>. 1 <strong>Imperial Order</strong>. 3 <strong>Imperm</strong>.  &nbsp;"

Most of the time you won't be making this board btw. The deck is very cheap exept revolution dragon but you can substite him with allure of darkness.There is a single union carrier because in the side because with him you can play pendulum call and darkwurm in the deck too (you just pop the set iris from carrier with tornado dragon insted of just using his effect). I'm not using carrier because it will take too much space in the main deck and it will become pure pend mags. The rest of the extra deck is just useful cards

I'm not a furry but I like the Fairy Tail archetype, so to make up for their flaws I decided to make them more of a control deck with village and such, and Invoked to turbo out Mechaba for negates since they're all light. Using Village and them all, they can control the game fairly well and be adorable as they do it. There's also a few OCG cards in this though so, note that. Credit to this deck for the turn lock. https://ygoprodeck.com/bamboo-sword-terminal-lock-down/ <span>Deck Guide</span>  3x Sleeper- Sleeper helps to make up for the slowness of the Fairy Tails, special summoning another from the hand. The problem is that it's a flip effect, so it's still slow. She's too cute to leave out though. In case your opponent manages to bypass your Village, you always have Sleeper there as backup to overwrite their spells into recycling Sleeper. 3x Rockha- Rockha is a simple card that manages to get us more resources, although it's up to the opponent what we get, which is fairly annoying and was sorta unnecesary on the part of Konami, but whatever. Rockha also dips when attacked, which is, sorta useless. 3x Rella- Rella gives protection to your more important monsters from spell targeting, which is minor, but still fairly helpful in some situations. And at the cost of discarding a spell, Rella equips a equip spell to herself from anywhere, specifically Bamboo Sword in this case, for the turn skip combo. While it's bounced back at the end of the turn, it still means we can recycle the turn skip. 3x Luna- Luna searches all the Fairy Tails on summon, including herself, as they all have 1850 attack (fun fact: she has great synergy with the Charmers as well due to this). Luna also can bounce herself back to the hand to bounce an opponent's monster to the hand, making her an invaluable piece of spot removal due to how weak the monsters are in this deck. 3x Aleister- Aleister is a key part of the Invoked engine. On summon, he searches out Invocation, allowing you to quickly turbo into Mechaba or anything else you need.  He also can discard himeslf to give a boost of 1000 attack to one of your fusions, which is very helpful for beating over problem monsters, as it gets out the main target for Invocation, Mechaba, to 35k attack, which is above average and means he can beat over most things. 3x Ash- Ash is another great control card and a staple in nearly any modern deck, as it can negate a search during either player's turn. This means that you can cripple combos and, when timed well, fully intterupt them and stop them from happening all together, which is fantastic. And no Jobe, it's not getting limited. 3x Fairy Tail- Fairy Tail helps with field swarming, which is something Fairy Tails normally struggle with, as it allows you to normal summon a spellcaster with 1850 attack in addition to your normal summon. It also mitigates damage, as the first damage you would take with one of your 1850 spellcasters, you do not, which is also great due to the low attack stats of the Fairy Tails. (Fun fact: This card also has great synergy with Charmers, due to the Charmers being spellcasters with 1850 attack.) 3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the key pieces of the Invoked engine. It allows you to summon using your monsters on your hand/field/grave, and the opponent's grave, which is great. The main target for this is Mechaba, as the Fairy Tails are all lights and that means you can quickly turbo into Mechaba on turn 1 to set up an easy negate. Although, depending on the match up you can also go into more stuff like Purgatrio to punish a swarm deck. 3x Secret Village- Secret Village is one of the deck's key cards. A majority of the deck is spellcasters, aside from Ashblossom, which means you can easily normal summon out a Fairy Tail and activate Secret Village to have the lock on turn 1. Most decks rely on spells, so not being able to have them will be crippling. And outing Secret Village without them will be insanely hard due to not having access to any spells, which makes up most spell/trap removal. 3x Knowledge- Knowledge is the deck's main draw power. At the cost of sending a Spellcaster to grave, which doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things (as you can easily send an Aleister and then banish said Aleister from grave for a fusion since Invocation reaches into grave), and then draw 2. While you stay even in card advantage, it's still a great draw. 3x Terminal World- Terminal World is another lockdown card, to basically remove the second main phase from play. A lot of decks like setting their shit in the second main phase, and a lot of decks are forced to skip the main phase due to various effects so you can force them to skip the main phase 2 as well. You can also use this in tandem with Burning Bamboo Sword and regular Bamboo Sword to fully skip the opponent's turn. 3x Burning Bamboo Sword- Burning Bamboo Sword is another one of the cards for the turn skip. Alongside Terminal World, as long as you have bamboo sword equipped to one of your monsters and Terminal World active, your opponent can't go into either of their main phases, making it so they can't do shit. Couple this with a possible Mechaba or Village lock, and it's near impossible to out. 2x Broken Bamboo Sword- The main target for Rella's effect, you'll want to get it out with Terminal and Burning to lock down the opponent and skip their turn completely. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming serves to get out Village, another layer of negates alongside the Bamboo combo. 1x Metaverse- see above <span>The extra deck </span>3x Moon Magistus- Moon Magistus is an easy link-1 that you can link away Aleister or something from to have a light on the field, just in case you don't have a Fairy Tail, somehow. 3x Ninaru- Ninaru serves to recover your lost Fairy Tails and Aleisters, making it so you can recycle them for more plays mid-to late game.  1x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.  2x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which you most likely will as you don't expend a ton of resources. . You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.  1x Magellanica- Magellanica is basically a big 3k beater that is actually a vanilla.  Magell isn’t super good but still fairly useful against earth heavy decks. I wish Aleister would’ve turned into a cat girl instead of this though.  1x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.  1x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.  1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there  21 Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it.  1x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks, and it's floodgate effect helps the control idea of this deck greatly.  <span>Playing guide <span>The main idea is to initate as many locks and negates as you can going first. Set up either the Village lock or the Bamboo/Terminal lock, so your opponent's turn is skipped and/or they can't activate any spells since you'll most likely have a Spellcaster on the field. The Bamboo/Terminal lock is fairly inconsistent, but is worth it with just how powerful it is. You can search out Broken with Rella, and then activate Burning, and then Terminal, so your opponent is fully fucked. You can also use the Invocation engine as well to get out Mechaba for an extra layer of control, to provide more negates on the opponent. After you control the gamestate and such, you just gotta slowly whittle down the opponent until you win. </span></span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Thank you, have a good day!"

I'm still working on tweaking this, especially filling out the Extra Deck.  The Side deck is mostly just cards I wanted to put in, but didn't have room for, so if, for some reason, you decide to blindly take this deck to a tournament, you'll have to figure out a good one for yourself."
