Despite the fact that the ""Worm"" archetype came out during the early days of Duel Terminal, they are still a fairly solid deck in a more casual environment. While the archetype features 26 monsters, only a few of those are really worth playing, but those core monsters can pack quite a punch.</p> <p>""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>"" is your main searcher and will often be your first turn monster to set face-down for that fact. It obviously still searches if it does not survive an encounter with the opposing monsters, but with ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"" you can make sure that ""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>"" searches, lives to be used for Xyz and Link monsters, while your life points stay unharmed aswell. Swarming comes in form of ""<a data-name=""Worm Xex"">Worm Xex</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Worm Yagan"">Worm Yagan</a>"", the first one being the ""Worm"" version of a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"", while the other one can revive itself when ""<a data-name=""Worm Xex"">Worm Xex</a>"" is alone on the field. With ""<a data-name=""Worm Call"">Worm Call</a>"", you can easily summon cards like ""<a data-name=""Worm King"">Worm King</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>"", the first one being your main beater and a walking monster removal while the other one is a gimmick option that can nuke the opposing monster zones and potentially become the biggest beater you have access to. ""<a data-name=""Worm Zero"">Worm Zero</a>"" is an option to go into via ""<a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"", but the card is nothing to rely on every game (even though it might push ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>"" to new heights stat-wise). ""<a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>"" is the well-known Light handtrap and allows you to fight (and surprise) opponents.</p> <p>The backrow is filled with Stun options including ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" to keep Special summons in check (also, it has the handy effect of being useable twice), ""Solemns"" to keep the opposition from doing anything stupid and ""<a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a>"" to punish the opponent for destroying your backrow. ""<a data-name=""W Nebula Meteorite"">W Nebula Meteorite</a>"" is a seriously useful card in combination with some ""Worms"" and a ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"", triggering ""<a data-name=""Worm Cartaros"">Worm Cartaros</a>'"" search effect and ""<a data-name=""Worm Victory"">Worm Victory</a>'s"" nuking, then flipping everything down for another round, summoning a ""<a data-name=""Worm King"">Worm King</a>"" for free and then drawing a truckload of cards. Finally, the added ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" make the deck more versatile and quite a bit faster.</p> <p>""Worms"" are, despite my efforts to make them somewhat useable, still a rather weak archetype. However, I feel like this is a decent attempt on making them somewhat playable against other decks on the same power level. I also gave an entire archetype analysis a spin, which you can read on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/archetype-analysis-worm/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/archetype-analysis-worm/</a>.</p>"

Trigger its effect, paying 2000 LP, to pitch Red-Eyes Fusion, Dark Magician, and Red-Eyes B. Dragon to summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon from the Extra Deck.  2.

Obviously it's not meta, but it's more playable as a tier 3-2 deck.","This is not a fan-base deck, while making this deck I took into consideration the most useful Fortune lady monsters, spells, and traps while still maintaining the deck's main strategy which is synchro summon fortune lady every and the banished zone. It's more of a control based deck with a synchro/link toolbox in the ED. It can go both first and 2nd (if you open any handtrap) but it's recommended to go first with this deck.  This is the deck's core, in the side deck are only SPELLCASTER handtraps, you need to play at least 9 more spellcasters besides Fortune ladies so your fortune lady past's effect have enough resources to summon FL Every.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/DMPyal0"">https://imgur.com/DMPyal0</a>  &nbsp;  UPDATE No.1: I've switched a Rivalry of warlords and lightning storm out of the maindeck and side deck, those cards are not that great for this particular deck, mainly because the new replacements, both crackdown and royal decree are more versatile against meta and non-meta decks, also rivalry locks you down from summoning halqifibrax, accesscode, crystal wing, etc.  It does hurt the opponent, but in specific cases it hurts you more than them. (vs salamangreat, blue-eyes, etc.)  Royal decree is mostly against mystic mine and other heavy trap decks like traptrix, in the sidedeck we already have secret village which counters mystic mine a lot, but obviously, it's not enough.  I will later post a bunch of tech cards that can be used in this deck for future formats alongside the core of this deck so you guys can also tweak for yourselves this deck.  UPDATE No.2: added Triple Tactics talent to the deck, both upstart and Fortune lady rewind weren't needed. Monster reborn &gt; Rewind.  UPDATE No.3: swapped drolls for shifter, shifter hurts eldlich a lot, and because of Fortune lady past's effect, you can banish shifter to keep your GY empty, and if you have another copy in your hand, you can keep looping it for more than 4 turns with FL past. And because of this, I took out MR for Rewind, and replaced 3 Called by the grave for 3 Triple tactics talent."

This deck is both unexpected and powerful if givern a turn to set up. who wo,"The main strategy of the deck is to set up flood gates and get out 1 of the main Elementsabers, Lapauila or Molehu, then grind your opponent out of resources slowly but steadily. 1 of my favourite things about the deck is that with there GY attribute changing abilities it is easy to some the dreaded Dark Armed Dragon which still to this day is a powerful boss monster. Their in archetype final battle, Elemental Training, allows you to dodge targeting effects while also going into a new Elementsaber and protecting the field spell, Palace of the Elemental Lords. You don't need more than 2 brain cells to play this deck but it is somewhat funny watching your opponent struggle to a deck of kids in armour. all in all, it is a cheap and somewhat competitive deck that if they get the right support could easily become meta. If only they had a way to stop the defect of skipping your next Battle Phase. Thanks for reading bye."

The <strong>Shaddoll</strong> part of our deck is for beefing up our <strong>Crusadia Equimax</strong> with our <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions. There isn't a high number of <strong>Crusadia</strong> main deck monsters since we want to be able to beef up <strong>Equimax</strong> with Fusion monsters and not <strong>Crusadia</strong> monsters.  <strong>Reclusia</strong> isn't in the deck since we can just use things like<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> for removal and<strong> Forbidden Droplets</strong> for negations. If you really want, you could replace the one <strong>Leonis</strong> for one <strong>Reclusia</strong>. You need to have playable cards in your hand very often during your combos so we are playing <strong>Shaddoll Beast</strong> and <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>. <strong>Squamata</strong> can send <strong>Beast</strong> to get you your draw or send <strong>Hedgehog</strong> for material for <strong>El Shaddoll Fusion</strong>. <strong>Wendi</strong> and <strong>Ariel</strong> are purely for different attributes for <strong>Apkallone</strong>, but you can still use their grave effects. If you send <strong>Wendi</strong> you have have a expendable tribute for <strong>Equimax</strong>'s negation if you summon it to a zone he points to. One <strong>Crusadia Testament</strong> so as not to brick your hand with a useless card during the main phase. <strong>Shaddoll Schism</strong> is to make things like <strong>Construct</strong> and<strong> Winda</strong> on your opponent's turn if they survive.  Side Deck has <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> as another material for <strong>Construct</strong> and an interruption if necessary. <strong>Shaddoll Dragon</strong> is against Backrow Decks. <strong>Magicalized Fusion</strong> to get things like <strong>Winda</strong> out going first since for <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> to be at its best, your opponent has to have an extra deck monster on their field. <strong>Imperm</strong> for negations if needed.<strong> Red Reboot</strong> for Trap Decks. 2 more<strong> Schism</strong> for going first and you want to see it.  You never want to normal summon the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> part of your Deck. Your entire <strong>Crusadia</strong> combo depends on a normal summon of a <strong>Crusadia</strong> monster. A good hand should have at 2 <strong>Crusadia</strong> monsters and ways to do your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> plays. Once you get to <strong>Equimax</strong>, if you also have <strong>Maximus</strong> on the field, you've basically won if you can make your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions. The fusions you really should make are <strong>Apkallone</strong> and <strong>Winda</strong> since<strong> Apkallone</strong>'s materials are fairly simple to have onboard and <strong>Winda</strong> is a Floodgate. You kind of have to play with your hand with this deck."

This is not a literal play deck, but it is still playable. It just currently does way too much. A bad hand leads to too much stalling, which leads to not having enough to stop your opponent from disrupting your plays when finally getting them.</span>  <span>So what am I doing here? I'm combining 2 control themes into one. From testing, I can easily choose which control style for the situation. Rikka for unconventional control. Generaider’s for established, familiar, give and take-style of control. </span>  <span>My winning strategy is to control the board. Hit hard. Obviously, I am finding it hard to get around T1 unbreakable boards. But I find that the more Konami builds on Rikka Fairy archetype will lead them to being the go to deck-type to break those boards. Due to Flurries being such an under-rated, under appreciated and very strong card. </span>  <span>Lastly, I have not fully incorporated the ROTD additions. Strenna and IDP. Seeing as I've only played with them online and am still waiting on my priority 1st class snail mail so I can get my hands on them; to play with locals.</span>  <b>Rikka Fairy:</b><span> </span>  <span>The Rikka selection of cards are not set in stone. Due to my choosing so few Rikka spell/traps, I shouldn't play as many Mudans. Seeing as Strenna will bring in the element of recycling/recurring things from GY. </span>  <span>Also, Mudan is more for a pure Rikka heavy deck profile. Seeing as Glamour can target 2 Rikka Fairies of the same lv, if you pay tribute. Rather than just 1 Rikka Fairy.</span>  <span>I went with 2 Primula and 1 Cyclamen for level maintenance to go into whatever Rank plays the situation calls for. I mean, if played right, I can technically go into any rank between Rank 1 to 11. </span>  <span>Finally, I put 1 Rikka Petal in the mix. She's necessary but also not necessary at the same time. If I'm going for Jorm or True King, her recurrence is blocked due to them not being plant, but she can help recover when it comes to it. Also, she’s a good banish bait. </span>  <b>Generaider:</b><span> </span>  <span>I kept the Generaider side package short and added Trias to the package because Trias is the most amazing lv9 of all times. It's almost always live in hand or the graveyard. God forbid nothing happens to my Generaider tokens that aren't sniped. I can pop a unprotected card and draw 2 and have a lv9 body, on the board, for XYZ play and discard fodder to have it ready to do all over again. 1 copy of Boss Room because it is a hefty brick if it's already on set or the opponent plays around it.</span>  <span>I want to test out Trias at 1. Maybe 2. If you don't know what Trias Hierachia is; She is a lv9 that SS herself if you have X Fairy(-ies) on board. Tribute 1, she comes out. 2, destroy 1 card. </span><b>Non-targeting.</b><span> 3, draw 2 cards. Quick effect. I have bricked with her. Having 1 in hand. 1 on the field. 1 in the GY.</span>  <span>Mardel because… I mean, it’s Mardel! She fetches any plant. Any generaider card. For setup, for extending, recovery...</span>  <span>Loptr, is a playmaker who literally sees board play; start to finish.</span>  <span>I am considering adding Harr, due to his big body and effect. I would almost want to add Monstrosity, but I would start leaning towards a more pure Generaider deck. </span>  <b>Generic Plants:</b><span> </span>  <span>Lonefire is way too staple to not use. Also, helps Snowdrop bypass tributing restrictions in order to go into non-plant xyz plays.</span>  <span>Rose Lover for an extra SS and GY target for the opponent.</span>  <span>Rose Girl, for her extend-ability. Also, let me play around with Queen of Thorns for the lulz. She is kind of on the chopping block when I start downsizing. Still, her constant SS’ing herself and returning to my hand and lv4 status keeps her in contention to be a staple lv4 in a Rikka deck.</span>  <span>I dropped Evil Thorn. Too often I found myself opening with 2, sometimes 3 copies, which really defeats the purpose of playing it.</span>  <b>Spell/Traps:</b><span> As going with control; Solemn trap cards are necessary, seeing as Rikka and Generaider’s don't have SS3 killer traps outside Rikkas having Pollinosis. Since there are non plants in the deck, Pollinosis becomes a brick more often than it can actually be used.</span>  <span>Pot of choice is Avarice, to send my Rikka and Generaider’s back to the deck and draw 2. I found Avarice helps Strenna focus on recurring spell/trap cards. 3 feels bricky. Might drop to 2.</span>  <span>Kuji-Kiri Curse is fun. It’s ideal target is Trias Heirachia. </span>  <span>Foolish Burial has multiple targets to send to GY for plays.</span>  <span>Monster Reborn. Necessity. But cut-able. </span>  <span>Raigeki. It’s fun... Will be dropped. </span>  <b>Extra Deck:</b>  <span>The extra deck is not established. Mostly big scary boss monsters that, once hitting the field, become questionable win conditions.</span>  <span>Teardrop is a fun boss to have in the early game, going for an early to mid game win. Alongside Generaider’s and Trias hitting the field, Teardrop can get pretty big, due to tributing. Even counts for Flurry making your opponent tribute their non-plant monsters.</span>  <span>Kanzashi, is on the chopping block. She is more of a tech card. It's cool to steal from other GY's but… niche. Her effect does play well with Snowdrop and lead to extending your board. But it's abit slow.</span>  <span>Jormungar. Excellent boss. His Generaider title suits him. Unfortunately, he is very unprotected but… even every second of him being up is basically + in your favor, and if Harr is up… even more shenanigans. </span>  <span>True King, big bad boogeyman monster. Excellent floodgates. Good body. Good target for 87s effect. Disgusting when paired with Queen of Thorns. I mean, disgusting at the time that is.</span>  <span>Queen of the Night, just a beater, that can progressive get bigger the longer she is up or buff other bosses. +300 AP.</span>  <span>Ingunar for his SS4 effect. Sucks that it is actually SS1.</span>  <span>Super Jasmine. Because it would be crazy to not have her in a plant deck. Might drop her to 1, but 2 feels right for the moment.</span>  <span>Lastly, Alsei. I'll admit I don't really know how to use Sylvan cards. Never been a huge fan of the excavating, especially with Rikkas having lacked the ability to recur things from the GY. I'm definitely dropping Alsei soon. If I keep him, it will be because of Strenna and I will re-add Rosebell spell cards and Princessprite.</span>  <b>Side Deck:</b><span> This is not my actual extra deck. Just a bunch of ideas I have on hand, couple to-do items and shirt wish list cards. Those 15 cards are estimated at ~$500 usd. Whereas the 60 card main deck and 15 card extra deck is about $200-205. Luckily I sniped most of them when they were cheap(-er).</span>  <b>Overall:</b><span> </span>  <span>This deck is fun. Needs tweaking. Needs more. Will surprise your opponent and shake the confidence in some people. Best moment while playing this deck is telling your opponent ""Nope"".</span>  <b>FREE MY BOYS DANDYLION AND GLOW-UP!

I was using Spellbooks as my engine for BM for a while but wanted something new. With the help of Black Fang Magician and plenty of search support cards for Pendulum Magicians, it's quite easy to get Black Magicians on the field and resurrect them if they're taken out. Plus, the Pendulum Magicians second as great buffs for your Black Magicians and Extra Deck Cards. Bricking is possible, but doesn't happen often, and even when it does you can usually outlast your opponent until you start getting some heavy hitters on the field.

The Numeron engine is small and easy to fit into any deck not reliant on the extra, and Fortune Ladies actually generate a crazy amount of card advantage. Bricking is very, very rare.  &nbsp;  Monsters -  3x Numeron Wall - Activates your Numeron field spell from the deck, meaning you love to see this turn one. Also works as a Battle Fader going second.  3x Ash Blossom - It's 2020 Yugioh, this should be self explanitory.  3x Fortune Lady Light - When this card leaves the field via card effect, you get a free special from your deck. We have a bunch of ways to trigger this ourselves.  2x Fortune Lady Past - The tuner of the deck, letting you summon the Fortune Lady boss monster.  2x Fortune Lady Fire - When special summoned by a Fortune Lady card, it can target and destroy a monster your opponent controls. Not the greatest of removals, but still comes in handy.  1x Fortune Lady Wind - When normal summoned, allows you to destroy spell/traps on the field. You aren't going to find yourself normaling this often, and it's really just run for the name.  2x Fortune Lady Water - Pot of Greed in spellcaster form. When special summoned while you control a Fortune Lady, you get to draw two cards. This thing'll generate an insane amount of advantage.  1x Fortune Lady Dark - Allows you to special Fortune Ladies in the grave when it destroys cards by battle, mostly used as a beatstick and for the name.  2x Fortune Fairy Hikari - When drawn, you can special this card. It then allows you to send a monster you control to summon a level 1 spellcaster from the deck. Normally you'll be sending itself for a Light, but sometimes you'll be able to send Light and trigger her effect which is exciting. The summon condition doesn't sound very good, but you draw so many cards with this deck, it's really easy to trigger.  &nbsp;  Spell/Traps  2x Numeron Calling/3x Numeron Network - The rest of the Numeron engine  2x Spellbook of Secrets/3x Spellbook of Knowledge - A draw engine you can stick in any spellcaster deck, with an added upside. Knowledge will trigger Lights effect if she's on the field, allowing you to both draw two and special one. Depending on the board state, the special could be Water, allowing you to draw another two, etc etc. Lots of draws.  3x Fortune Vision - Mostly used as a searcher. Also works as protection through the banish effect, but only on your own turn really, which is less good. The other effect to reduce battle damage is annoying, but that's about it.  2x Fortune Lady Calling - Special a Fortune Lady if you already have one. Can be used to summon and trigger Water, or can be used to grab a Light/Past from the deck as an extender.  1x Fortune's Future - Return a banished Fortune Lady to the grave to draw two. You'll have a Fortune Lady banished most of the time, but I could only find room for one of these. Just more draw power.  2x Future Vision - One of the more annoying field spells in the game. The banish effect will trigger both parts of Fortune Vision, and shuts down a lot of decks that rely on a normal summon. Also triggers Light as soon as she's summoned, which is real nice. Unfortunately, the return effect is not a special summon, so it won't trigger Water.  1x Magicalized Fusion - You go through cards so fast in this deck, this is really just a free boss monster.  1x One for One - Can be used to summon Numeron Wall turn 1, and can also be used to grab Light or Past.  1x Fortune Lady Rewind - Really helps in getting that last extra damage. Banishing 5 with Magicalized Fusion, and then summoning them all back, leads to a big chunk of damage.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck -  Numeron Gates - Necessary for the Numeron engine. Combined with the field spell, will sometimes just win you games on their own.  2x Utopic Zexal - 2 is probably overkill, but I've had games where I've used both. The boss of the Numeron cards, and just stops your opponent from playing the game for multiple turns. If this card doesn't get hit at some point I'll be surprised.  2x Fortune Lady Every - Non targeting, Non destruction removal. She'll keep bringing herself back too, really annoying to deal with.  1x Quintet Magician - Really a free boss for a deck with so many names. You'll get the destruction effect more often than not, and has a crazy amount of attack and built in protection on top of everything else.  1x Black Rose - I've noticed this deck has issues removing monsters outside of Every and Fire effects, so I'm running this to compensate. You could probably easily find a replacement, but this card will come up. Also I really miss running Black Rose  1x Formula - Mostly used for the draw, Past is level 1, and we have 8 level 1 non tuner monsters. Formula can still be used to make both Every and Black Rose.  &nbsp;  I haven't been playing this deck for the longest of times, but hopefully you guys enjoy it as much as I have."

The ""B.E.S."" archetype features battleships whose level starts at 5 and therefore originally needed a lot of tribute summoning to get started. Fortunately, the Field Spell ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" was made around 2017, which allows the archetype to skip the slow method and simply put some space ships on the table. The ""B.E.S."" monsters themselves gain counters upon being summoned (with some members asking for Tribute Summons, while other member do not really care how they enter the field) which protects them from battle destruction for the cost of one counter per battle. They automatically destroy themselves upon battling without counters, but in fairness this does not happen that often.</p><p>The main combo of this deck is ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" plus ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"". The Field Spell boosts the stats, gives added protection, searches the other part of the combo in form of ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" upon entering the field, gives extra counters and allows you once per turn to summon an extra ""B.E.S."" monster from your hand. ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" will then search out members of the archetype during the End Phase of a turn you lost monsters, which you can use to the fullest by blasting the field and ending up resource-positive, while the opponent took an actually blow to their board state.</p><p>The core of the deck is made out of three copies of ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Blaster Cannon Core"">B.E.S. Blaster Cannon Core</a>"", ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-3"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-3</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-2"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-2</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Blaster Cannon Core"">Blaster Cannon Core</a>"" is absolutely fantastic, can be Special summoned at almost all stages of the game and gives the deck another sizeable beater for the OTK strategy. ""<a data-name=""Big Core MK-3"">Big Core MK-3</a>"" has a less useful summon mechanic than ""<a data-name=""Blaster Cannon Core"">Blaster Cannon Core</a>"" but recycles ""B.E.S."" monsters from the graveyard for more longevity. ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Big Core MK-2"">B.E.S. Big Core MK-2</a>"" is slightly worse than the other two, but is still a solid beater who can be Special summoned via ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"" and Normal summoned via its own effect. One ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Tetran"">B.E.S. Tetran</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""B.E.S. Crystal Core"">B.E.S. Crystal Core</a>"" are also part of the ""B.E.S."" line-up of this deck: They will both enter the field with only one counter when summoned via ""<a data-name=""B.E.F. Zelos"">B.E.F. Zelos</a>"", but they can remove the counter to pop backrow or change battle position respectively. There is also one copy of ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" in the deck which is mainly used as another Special Summon option while also giving access to ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>"", and two copies of ""<a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=71197066"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/71197066.jpg"" data-card=""71197066"" data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher</span></a>""&nbsp; as a useful option to summon that also provides spot removal.</p><p>On the ""Kaiju"" front, I run one ""<a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju"">Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju</a>"", who will all mostly end up on the opposing board either via their own tribute effect or via ""<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>"" (which triggers ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"" if you blast ""B.E.S."" monsters with it). The two copies of ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" are for my side of the board and are one of the ways to OTK the opponent together with any almost any ""B.E.S."" monster and a ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"".</p><p>Talking about ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"": The same fact that applied to ""<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>"" also applies to ""<a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a>"", meaning you can buff your monsters, wait for the End Phase if you did not manage to kill and then simply build another board via ""<a data-name=""Boss Rush"">Boss Rush</a>"". Other generic options the deck sports are ""<a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>"", since you almost lose nothing by negating the effects of your monsters, while the opponent has good chances of being stopped by it, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for more swarming and kill potential, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=49238328"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49238328.jpg"" data-card=""49238328"" data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</span></a>"" as a draw spell with pretty much no drawback in this deck, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=70368879"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/70368879.jpg"" data-card=""70368879"" data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</span></a>"" as one blank card, ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=54693926"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/54693926.jpg"" data-card=""54693926"" data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</span></a>"" as a board-breaking tool, and both ""<a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=73628505"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/73628505.jpg"" data-card=""73628505"" data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</span></a>"" and ""<a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=89208725"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/89208725.jpg"" data-card=""89208725"" data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</span></a>"" for easier access to the Field Spell.</p><p>The Extra Deck is not that important in ""B.E.S."" since you will be mostly relying on your Main Deck monsters to do the damage, but one can fit some options into it that might prove worthwhile once in a blue moon. ""<a data-name=""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" are all in the deck for their non-destruction removal effects with alternating ranks of 9, 8 and 7, allowing you to use whatever combination you can access the easiest in any given situation. Some of the Link Monsters are ""<a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a>"" as a beater, the ""Knightmares"" for backrow and monster removal, ""<a data-name=""Pentestag"">Pentestag</a>"" as an option to give a beater piercing damage, ""<a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a>"" for her bounce effect, ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" for further stat boosts and ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" for those rare cases when you lose your Field Spell but still have monsters to work with and try to turn the game back around.</p><p>That should sum everything up.

Your aim with this deck is to win by Catapult Turtle tributing a 22000+ Cyberse Clock Dragon for FTK. This is achieved with my optimised strategy using Code Talker link climbing.  Key card is Cynet Codec, which lets you search out any Cyberse from your deck with the same attribute as a Code Talker you just summoned. Hard once per turn of course. You search out monsters that can special summon themselves or other monsters easily, search from deck or link off from hand, like Lady Debug, Widget Kid, Code Generator, Backup Secretary, Mathmechs, etc. But do NOT use the effect of Transcode Talker while you are Link climbing!  To have Codec in hand to get the loop started, you have several key cards. The first one is Micro Coder that allows you to search a Cynet spell from your deck when used as Link material, and it can link itself from the hand. Next you have Lady Debug, which can search Micro Coder. Then Cynet Mining, which can search Lady Debug. Altogether that's eleven ways of having Codec in your starting hand, twelve if you play Debug at 3 and 13 if you play One for One.  Then you also want to have Clock Wyvern in your hand to fuse with a Link monster to get Clock Dragon. You might have it in your starting hand or get in one of the ways described above, and off of the link summon of Excode with Codec on field. You can use its on-field effect to make a token, but don't link off Clock Wyvern itself! Cynet fusion is gotten by getting a Clock Spartoi - doesn't matter which monsters you use, you want all your Link monsters in GY anyways.  Then continue to Link summon until you have two preferably high link-rating monsters on field like Bomber Dragon or Avramax, and link into Clock Lizard. Use its effect to return the Clock Dragon you linked off before into your Extra Deck, and fuse Wyvern with as many Link monsters in your graveyard as possible, so that their link rating reaches your remaining deck size (usually ~22-25), and mill the rest of your deck.  Seyfert returns Levianeer to hand, and because we didn't use Transcode's effect before, we can special summon it by banishing 3 LIGHT monsters from GY. This then allows us to special summon Catapult Turtle from GY via Levianeer, and tribute Clock Dragon for 11000+ burn damage turn 1.  As it turns out, this deck is surprisingly consistent, and you can add any cards that go well with the special summon-theme of the deck, like Cache Eve L2 or Linkslayer.  &nbsp;"

Deck idea formulated after 4 Exodia encounters which i lost close. First Submission have fun with th,"Play this deck if you are sure that you go up against Exodia or are in a Tag Duel - it is for fun and allows you to bypass strong monsters.  Main strategy:  <strong>Nightmare Horse</strong> can attack your opponent directly but has only <strong>ATK 500</strong> therefore you have the equip spell cards <strong>United We Stand</strong> and <strong>Mage Power</strong> which you can search via <strong>Armory Call</strong> and <strong>Hidden Armory. </strong>Exodia decks come usually with the Field spell <strong>Mystic Mine</strong> which prevents you from activating monster effects and declare an attack at all therefore you  have the monster <strong>Gate Blocker </strong>to negate it beforehand which your opponent has, as many Exodia decks have usually a lot of drawing and defensive but no offensive power, no counter for.  <strong>Sangan's</strong> effect can be used to search for the monsters having <strong>ATK 1500 and lower</strong> which is tha case for the more defensive monsters with the attritype DARK which will be used as material for <strong>Dark Armed Dragon</strong> and <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer Foolish Burial </strong>will help you in that regard. For the course of the duel you should keep track of which parts of Exodia are in the deck of your opponend as chaos <strong>Lullaby of Obedience</strong> can be used to get your hands on one part of the 5 required pieces the opponent decides if you add it to your hand or special summon it.  Secondary strategy:  <strong>Ojama Trio, Ojama Duo, Ground Collapse</strong> and <strong>Soul Exchange</strong> are here to either block your opponent monster zones or get rid of face up monsters by tributing them and summoning a monster to your side. I decided against <strong>Kaiju's</strong> for that aspect.

Opening with Machina Reployment opens up another line of play by giving your the additional monster to go into Scrap Wyvern. This means you can get Machina Citadel on board in addition to the standard endboard, which represents another form of disruption on the opponent's turn.  Urgent Schedule, Tuning, Triple Tactics Talent, Crossout Designator, along with any other 1-card Halqifibrax enablers can be included in the deck depending on the format."

The main draw engine of the deck is having Endymion, the Master Magician (Effect Monster) in grave or hand, and building spell counters on your Magical Citadel of Endymion ( Endymion's Lab becomes Magical Citadel on the field) so you can remove 6 spell counters from them and special summon Endymion and get a spell card from grave, usually the best target is Wonder Wand, as with this combo you special Endymion get wonder wand equip send to grave then draw 2 and extend your combo with more spells to draw even more cards in a turn. Endymion's Lab is a COMBO MULTIPLIER for Spell counters, so for each copy you up your spell counter multiplier from 1x, to 2x, to 3x PER SPELL CARD!!!! And you get a free spell card just for special summoning Endymion so your already halfway to ANOTHER DRAW 2 CARDS when you activate that one free spell. I have drawn my entire deck on turn one on multiple occasions with only a 2x Multiplier. You can increase your combo multiplier by 1x per turn (Can only activate Endymion's Lab once per turn) so try to avoid picking this card up for that precious negate if possible. Its secondary effect can be used to summon Endymion, the Mighty Master Magician from deck by removing 6 spell counters from field when any spellcaster type monster is destroyed by battle, or you can summon reflection for the disruption/bounce and a search if its destroyed."

Not letting your opponent have a turn at all.,"<span>This deck has 2 main goals: the far more reliable Megalith lockdown with Bethor on deck, and the far more disrespectful ""Turn Skip"". </span>  <span>In either case, you want to find a way to start summoning Megalith Ophiel and/or Megalith Hagith to start searching for more cards to combo further and build towards summoning Gallant Granite to search for Block Dragon. If you summon Gallant Granite into an Extra Monster Zone, you can link it off into Gravity Controller to easily put it and its other material into the GY to be banished for Block Dragon's summon. It's also better to summon Block Dragon from the GY after using Megalith Phul or Megalith Unformed to send it from your hand as Ritual tribute.</span>  <span>Megalith Phul is easily the best card this archetype has going for it. Being level 2 makes it easy to summon with Megalith Unformed (which is why I feel only 2 copies are necessary), it can ritual summon other Megalith monsters <em>from your deck</em> without even having to tribute itself off (and this is a quick effect!), and it can modulate its own level, so if you <em>did</em> want to have Phul use itself as tribute, you could potentially make it level 8 first to then summon <em>any</em> Megalith you want from your deck with Phul being the sole tribute.</span> <p>Megalith Lockdown</p> <p><span>Megaltith Phul is the key to the more lockdown oriented approach. The goal is to combo for as long as possible to load your GY up with as many different Megalith's as possible (just beware of Nibiru), and end with Phul on board (best if you have a lvl 8 Megalith in hand, and Aratron on board, or have just made Phul lvl 8 by its effect). Then, during your opponent's turn, use Phul's effect to summon a Megalith Bethor from your deck or hand to wipe out your opponent's board whenever you see the opportunity to do the most damage. </span></p> <span>Adding to the ""lockdown"" nature of this strategy is Barrier Statue of Drought. Being 1 of only 3 normal summons in the deck (the other 2 being 2 copies of Manju), you will likely be able to search for the Barrier Statue along with another lvl4 Megalith off of Block Dragon's effect and Normal Summon it to lock your opponent into Special Summoning only Earth monsters (something that barely has any effect at all on this deck). Normally Barrier Statues are pretty easy to deal with, just requiring you to use your Battle Phase to attack over their measly 1000 ATK/DEF, but if your opponent attempts to move to their battle phase, you can blow away whatever they've summoned by using Megalith Phul to summon Megalith Bethor, leaving them stuck under the Barrier Statue lock.</span> <p>""Turn Skip""</p> <span>This strategy relies on a particular quirk within the rules of the game regarding the Main Phase 2, namely: you cannot proceed directly to a Main Phase 2 without first entering/conducting your Battle Phase. If you have no Battle Phase, you don't get a Main Phase 2, and if you don't get a Main Phase 1 <em>or</em> a Battle Phase/Main Phase 2, you essentially get no turn.</span>  <span>To achieve this, all you need to do is summon Amorphactor Pain the Imagination Dracoverlord (all level 4 Megalith monsters can summon <em>any</em> ritual monster from your hand, not just Megaliths) and set Thunder of Ruler.</span>  <span>Even if you don't manage to get both pieces of this combo together, Amorphactor Pain is still a beefy level 8 Earth ritual monster that can be rather easily summoned or used as material, and it still skips your opponent's Main Phase 1 while also shutting down all Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters on the field. Even Thunder of Ruler can be handy in providing extra protection for your Barrier Statue of Drought, preventing your opponent from simply attacking over it to remove the restriction on their Special Summons, if you find it in your opening hand without Amorphactor Pain.</span>"

Plufines the Unconventional Commander is super great in Metaphys, not only it banishes Ascension for Assymetaphys as starter, it also sets the trap banished as recovery if it's destroyed by your opponent. <strong>All we need is to banish Daedalus and Nephthys</strong>, so we maxed out the starter cards such as Daedalus, Nephthys, Plufines, Aloof, Crossout, Gold Sarc, and Assymetaphys. <strong>Nephthys</strong> will add Daedalus (monster nuke)/Nephthys (backrow nuke), <strong>Daedalus</strong> will send Tyrant, and Tyrant will ss Metaphys from hand on our next turn to nuke, it means we have to juggle our resource between Daedalus/Nephthys/Tyrant.  We don't run Ragnarok as it is a gamble, only mills 3 (very lackluster), and its second effect is a win-more effect. Decoy Dragon as extra body, only run 1 cus it's super easy for opponent to play around it. Also if we have excessive resource, we can banish more Tyrant/Nephthys as extra body/search.  Pros: Good consistency for nuking, big staple slot, banishing is a super strong mechanic.  Cons: First turn board is weak.  PS: all the ""old monster"" name mentioned is their Metaphys retrain."

Canonically, they were made to fight against the ""Worm"" archetype which is reflected in the game by their anti-Light Attribute effects and certain cards working specifically against face-down cards. While the idea is not that terrible, the archetype certainly started rather weak and got only worse over time due to power-creep. However, I tried to make the most out of a deck which sole reason of existence is to fight the Light Attribute.</p> <p>The first card I need to talk about is ""<a data-name=""DNA Transplant"">DNA Transplant</a>"". There are some very good Light Attribute archetypes like ""Lightsworn"", ""Cyber Dragon"", ""Blue-Eyes"" and many more, but since it is only one out of six Attributes in the game (I am aware that Divine exists, but I rarely encounter a deck that focusses on that Attribute) chances are that you will have to play against decks that you have no inherent bonus against. ""<a data-name=""DNA Transplant"">DNA Transplant</a>"" was played in a previous version of this deck since it allows you to transform the opposing monsters into Light Attribute, but I opted to skip the card due to not being consistent or searchable and instead added options to give to opponent the Light monsters I am playing.</p> <p>Speaking of which, in case the opponent has Light monsters you can work with a few nice options. ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Quarantine"">Ally of Justice Quarantine</a>"" flatout prohibits the Special summon of Light monsters, ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Core Destroyer"">Ally of Justice Core Destroyer</a>"" has weak ATK but destroys any Light monster without breaking a sweat and the Extra Deck ""Allies"" can also help getting the job done.</p> <p>Both ""<a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a>"" are Light Attribute and can be switched onto the opposing board via ""<a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a>"" while still triggering their effects for you if they get destroyed. ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" removes threats you cannot get past normally, while also being fairly easy to beat via ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Core Destroyer"">Ally of Justice Core Destroyer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a>"". Finally, ""<a data-name=""Leeching the Light"">Leeching the Light</a>"" is one of many ATK boosting options, allowing you to either use the opposing monsters to fuel your monsters' ATK stats via correct matchup or enabling the effect yourself by putting either a ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>""/""<a data-name=""Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju"">Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</a>"" onto the opponent's side of the field or switch monsters via ""<a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a>"".</p> <p>In reverse, most of your other monster options are Dark Attribute, which is also something this deck tries to make use of. ""<a data-name=""Dark Salvo"">Dark Salvo</a>"" can fetch another monster from the graveyard and gives you an easy way into Link 2 or Level 7 Synchro monsters. ""<a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a>"" is the second ATK booster to talk about, giving your monsters battle protection once per turn, further swarming upon destroying something and even gaining ATK bonuses by taking damage in battle. The last effect can also be triggered intentionally by ramming whatever you have available into the summoned ""<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" and giving your attacker the difference as attack power for the cost of your life points. The copies of ""<a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a>"" give you more sizeable bodies upon losing monsters.</p> <p>Naturally, there are some generic options aswell. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" means board clearing and an empty front row normally causes massive damage, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is obviously for monster revival, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" provides some swarming and the vast amounts of Levels in the deck makes hitting the right number rather difficult and ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>"" are there for consistency reasons. The three copies of ""Limiter Removal"" give the deck the option of threatening OTKs on a regular basis.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is really just an extension of your Main Deck, which features options that are nice to have but not always needed. ""<a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>"" gives ATK boosts, ""<a data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</a>"" searches anything you want from your deck monster-wise, ""<a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a>"" is another option to force the Light Attribute onto a monster, ""<a data-name=""Platinum Gadget"">Platinum Gadget</a>"" is more floating and pretty much serves as an option if you have to go into something in your Extra Deck but have no good option to use otherwise. The ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" is an amazing board-clears and easily makeable via ""<a data-name=""Black Salvo"">Black Salvo</a>"". Lastly, ""<a data-name=""Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf"">Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf</a>"" can turn one of your Machine monsters into an instant-killing attacker if the right ATK boosts are available. The two ""Ally of Justice"" Extra Deck monsters are choices you can go into as I mentioned, but they are in all fairness rather situational.</p> <p>While I think that this is pretty close to the ceiling of what can be done with ""Ally of Justice"", it has to be said that the archetype is still rather weak and the deck is pretty bricky, since none of the archetypal cards features any form of good searching or even solid interaction with its own archetype. However, this does not mean that one cannot build decks with them.
