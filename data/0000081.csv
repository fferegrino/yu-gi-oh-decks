Allowing the opponent to do nothing while their LP ticks away.,"This deck is effectively a deck where when your opponent makes a move you can counter it if necessary, and if you play the percentages right (meaning negating only what is necessary and not everything they do). You will find yourself with weak monsters on the board but your opponent has no cards in play or in their hands so you can just peck them down to O LP and win. The artifacts in this deck are used to take out nasty cards, lockdown your opponent farther, or just to continue knocking down their LP.

notes

if you have the chance early on to take out multifaker you might want to wait until they have their boss monster to take out multifaker and then silquitous or kunquery to return it to the hand (or extra deck) or just negate its affects so you can run over it next turn.

if possible make your big moves during the opponents battle phase so your moves have a lesser chance of being negated.

in general all your moves depend on your opponent so be smart based on the archetype you are up against. If you are an experienced player you can take advantage

of this and read them like the back of your hand and plan for common combo's associated with the archetype

Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram (aka Big Momma Marj) along with Aromaseraphy Jasmine are your key cards and both need to be summoned as quickly as possible in order to move the strategy along. These two cards will allow you to bring out you ""Winds"" Traps cards, focusing on Blessed Winds, in order to control the field.

The update comes from the addition of Gigaplant, Fallen Angel of Roses, and Rose Bell. With these cards, I believe, the deck is given some need ""oomph"" and extra deck summoning boost. I believe this to be true because I was always searching form a monster to bring out with my Lonefire after I set up my early game board of Sweet Marjoram and both Jasmines. I also added Relinquished Anima to help the going second game, along with my Thousand-Eyes Restrict (love taking those monsters off my opponents side).

As a side, I included Gizmek Yata in this build in order to take advantage of the second normal summon it provides along with its LP boost, which is always greatly appreciated in an Aroma deck. The second normal summon can be used to help bring out your other plant monsters.

I have tried to build the Main Deck in order to fulfill the requirements for either going first or second in the first game.Â  This includes the card selections in the Extra deck as well."

Now it's even more OP with Dinos. OTK and counter your opponent at will. ,Basically you'd want to have Ultimate Conductor Tyranno on the field as much as possible. There are a lot of ways to summon him with this deck and it also has a lot of versatility because of the shaddoll fusions. Best case scenario is if you're able to get out Tyranno and Winda on the field. It's almost certain that you'll win once that happens. There are also a lot of good xyz options in the side deck that could be a counter for any of your opponent's plays. It's so easy and fun to otk using this deck ALWAYS TRY TO GO SECONDÂ  TO GET THAT OTK. The side deck also has cards that will allow you to adjust to your opponent's deck on the succeeding matches.

A majority of these cards are power cards and they seem to work together

Some tips:

-Use the invoked engine and kaiju engine first because after using the Eldlich engine you can only summon zombies

-Rely on the floating effs of Eldlich and Aleister the invoker, and use the Kaijus to out problematic cards"

Don't get me wrong, with the right circumstances this deck can be crazy and just OTK even competitive decks.Â This deck mainly resolves around going second, spamming your superheavy samurai synchro's on the board (wich is very easily done with your main deck monsters) and eventually OTK'ing your opponent with very big beatsticks that can attack over almost anything in battle. Superheavy samurai's don't play spell and trap cards because most effects won't go off if there is a spell/trap card in the graveyard, this is very much one of the biggest weaknesses of the deck and really prevents the deck from playing staple going second cards (like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=14532163&amp;_ga=2.7716466.1946221507.1586598726-468166994.1525448304"">lightning storm</a>"" or ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly matched</a>""). The other gimmick is that the big superheavy samurai's can attack while in defense mode and apply their DEF for damage calculation, this is why all the strong cards have a very low ATK but a very big DEF.

Here I will quickly go over a few cards and why they are important;

<strong>""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Benkei""><span>Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei</span></a>""</strong>

This big boy is the main deck boss monster and is just an easy to bring out strong beatstick that allows all your samurai's to attack whilein defense mode. Usually you just cheat him out the deck by the effect of ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker"">Superheavy Samurai Soulpeacemaker</a>"" or by tributing ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Waraji"">Superheavy Samurai Big Waraji</a>"".

&nbsp;

<strong>""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Thief"">Superheavy Samurai Thief</a>""</strong>

""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Thief"">Superheavy Samurai Thief</a>"" together with Superheavy Samurai ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Waraji"">Big Waraji</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Transporter"">Transporter</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Scales"">Scales</a>"" and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Magnet"">Magnet</a>"" all special summon themselves or other samurai's to the field to easily go into your synchro monsters.

&nbsp;

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Trumpeter""><strong>""Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter""</strong></a>

This card is in my opinion one of the strongest cards in the deck and allow it to function much better than it should be. It is a free special summon if you don't have any spell and trap cards in the GY AND it special summons itself from the GY if it was used for the tribute summon of an Superheavy Samurai monster (mainly ""big benkei"").

&nbsp;

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Battleball""><strong>""Superheavy Samurai Battleball""</strong></a>

Ball boy is another very strong tuner and really is one of the reasons why the deck is so fun. This card, once per turn, allows you to target any of your opponents monsters that has a level and immediatly synchro summon a Superheavy Samurai synchro monster with the targeted monster and battleball. A great piece of removal that directly benefits you by giving you a strong monster. This card is also the reason why I play ""<span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Jizukiru%2C%20the%20Star%20Destroying%20Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>"" and ""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Gameciel%2C%20the%20Sea%20Turtle%20Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>"" because if targeted by battleballs effect you can summon ""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Steam%20Train%20King"">Superheavy Samurai Steam Train King</a>"" and ""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Warlord%20Susanowo"">Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo</a>"" respectivly.</span>

&nbsp;

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker""><strong>""<span class=""deck-card-name"">Superheavy Samurai Soulpeacemaker""</span></strong></a>

""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker"">Soulpeacemaker</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpiercer"">Soulpiercer</a>"" and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulhorns"">Soulhorns</a>"" all serve as the equip spell cards of the deck. ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker"">Soulpeacemaker</a>""Â special summons a Superheavy Samurai from the deck by tributing the equiped monster,""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpiercer"">Soulpiercer</a>"" adds a Superheavy Samurai from the deck when sent to the GY and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulhorns"">Soulhorns</a>"" allows the equiped monster to attack twice and can special summon itself when equiped. One of your better opening hands is opening ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker"">Soulpeacemaker</a>"" and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpiercer"">Soulpiercer</a>"", normal summoning Soulpiercer, equiping Soulpeacemaker, activating the effect of Soulpeacemaker and tributing Soulpiercer, now you can special summon a Samurai from your deck with peacemakers effect and add a Samurai with piercers effect (these cards depend a little bit on your hand but most of the time is is gonna be an tuner and something else).

&nbsp;

<strong>""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulbuster%20Gauntlet"">Soulbuster Gauntlet</a>""</strong>

This single flying arm is a handtrap that doubles the DEF of an battling Superheavy Samurai monster until the end of the turn, this is your biggest OTK enablre and really helps you taking games.

&nbsp;

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sekka%27s%20Light""><strong>""<span class=""deck-card-name"">Sekka's Light""</span></strong></a>

I know I said we can't play spells with Superheavy Samurai's but this card is the only exception. It allows you to draw 2 cards with the negative effect that you can't use any other spells for the rest of the duel, this is no problem since we don't play any other spell cards. You can also banish this card from your GY to shuffle a card from your hand back into the deck and draw a new card. This last effect makes it so that we don't have any spell or traps in the GY and doesn't prevent us from activating he effects of Superheavy Samurai monsters.

&nbsp;

<strong>Extra deck</strong>

In the extra deck we mostly play Superheavy Samurai Synchro's (duh) from different levels that help with different hands. The most important are <span class=""deck-card-name"">""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Steam%20Train%20King"">Superheavy Samurai Steam Train King</a>"" (your strongest monster and the one you want to play when trying to OTK) ""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Stealth%20Ninja"">Superheavy Samurai Stealth Ninja</a>"" (probaly the card you will summon very often because you play a lot of easy to bring out lvl5 monsters and lvl2 tuners) and ""</span><span class=""deck-card-name""><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Ogre%20Shutendoji"">Superheavy Samurai Ogre Shutendoji</a>"" (wich is basically a ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Harpie%27s%20Feather%20Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" on summon and a very strong pick against strong backrow decks)</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Side Deck</strong>

Yea, you can put anything you want in your sidedeck, I just putin a lot of handtraps that can help against certain matchups.

&nbsp;

In summary, ""Superheavy Samurai"" is a very fun, cheap and explosive deck that is a perfect beginners/casual deck BUT can aslo become very strong in a semi- competitive setting with theright circumstances.

Any questions or unclear things feel free to ask!

It means losing interaction, as well as the Fusion Destiny package, but frees up space in the extra deck and main deck, and increases consistency. You're a blind going second deck, with a bunch of options going first.

I'm going to start in a weird place. HEROES have many appeals, but I think a big one is the ROTAS. In addition to Reinforcement of the Army searching most of your starters, namely Stratos, Solid Soldier, and Liquid Soldier, and sometimes Shadow Mist, but E Emergency Call searches all of these as well as Honest Neos. A Hero Lives is the best of them all, starting you with a Stratos on the field without using a normal summon - your most insane hand is actually these 5 cards.

One thing to mention about A Hero Lives alongside Isolde, is that its a 1 card combo that ends on your choice of Darklaw + Absolute Zero + Sunrise + Mask Change, or Dread Decimator pointing to three Monsters. You can even end on Plasma + Sunrise + 1, off of just this one card. Thanks Isolde! You do this by going Stratos into Stratos, Stratos into Faris, then both Stratos into Isolde. From here there are a lot of lines you can take, and any other extenders or Rotas makes this way more powerful.

3 Stratos serve as the most important starter in your deck. These search any other creature in the deck off of a normal or special summon, which is pretty sweet, and the spell and trap removal is clutch too. 3 Faris is the other starter - this one card basically becomes 3 monsters, which is pretty good. You need 2 Increase and Vyon to search off of Faris.

Shadow Mist is the key searcher in the deck when forced to go first, and you need a way to special her to make Dark Law. The deck has plenty, from both of Solid Soldier's effects to one of Liquid Soldier's effects to Isolde in the extra deck. The searching effect is useful in pulling off OTKs with big boards full of monsters going second as well. It's either or on this card.

Solid Soldier and Liquid Soldier are both super-valuable cards, for different reasons. I'd run 2 Liquid easily if I has space, and I'd run 3 Solid, but the thing is with 5 Rotas you don't really need to. Solid Soldier can use both effects, and alongside Stratos can search Faris, make Isolde, find a monster to discard for Faris, and then use Isolde to summon either another Stratos or Shadow Mist. This is without other extenders. If you have something to discard to Faris, that's when the combo gets crazy - make Cross Crusader the usual way to extend combos as normal, and when you Fusion Summon Sunrise, you can special a monster from your GY, such as a Stratos to search a monster or a Shadow Mist to get a Mask Change. Liquid Soldier is super key as fusion material - the card draw is very valuable, while its summon effect is more icing, that-works well summoning Shadow Mist or Stratos. Sometimes I grab this with Isolde just to use as material, despite having its effects turned off for the turn.

2 Malicious are obligatory, even at 2 it's still pretty essential to the combo. 1 Plasma is the only other Destiny Hero to make the cut in the 40 card version. Shutting off Monster Effects is good, and the deck has ways to increase his mediocre power aplenty. This just adds to the potential going first plays.

Honest Neos is a searchable hand trap that helps with Trinity OTKS. We also have one Evil Hero Adusted Gold and one Dark Calling, to make Malicious Bane when needed.

For fusions Spells, we have 1 Poly to search off of Vyon, 1 Miracle Fusion to search off of Sunrise, 1 aforementioned Dark Calling, and 3 Mask Change.

We needed 5 equip spells to really get reliable summons off of Isolde, especially since sometimes you want to summon Faris off of her. Favorite Hero has become my favourite of them - it can help you pump Trinity up to 10000 ATK points with Honest Neos while also finding your mystic mine. Phoenix Blade is (funnily enough) sometimes useful just to banish E Heroes in you GY for The Shining, and is also just an equip you can get back for low cost. Axe of Fools hard negates effects on cards. This is good Omni-Negate bait at the least, and a nasty thing to put on Apollousa or Winda ect. Horn of the Unicorn and Malevolent Nuzzler aren't amazing, but they put in just enough work getting Dark Law above 3000 Atk points. They are primarily here so that if we see 2 equip spells, so long as one of them is one of these we can put them back into our deck.

Side deck is split into 2 parts - about half deals with backrow decks, while a little over half deals with monster decks (with Evenly Matched overlapping a bit). This lets you cut the Equip spells when you know you aren't going first for whichever interaction is appropriate in your matchup. The reason for the weird split on the spell and trap card removal is that against the Mystic Mine Burn decks it gives them more outs to name, making it harder to get a lock."

With the new rank 4 addition really makes the deck flows and super consistent on spewing Teardrop the Rikka Queen + its double o,"I think Konami plays YGO online simulator too, knowing the fact that this specific rank 4, Strenae the Rikka Queen, works so good in this deck. Anyway, I will explain this deck basic core and strategy. It uses Auroradon-001 combo (idk know which one is busted Halqifibrax or Auroradon) for summoning Strenae and at the same time provides us 2 draws for our 9 Rikka extenders (9 out of 40 cards is kinda big chance): 3 Snowdrop, 3 Mudan, 3 Glamour (Mudan searches Glamour then searches Snowdrop, so basically we need Snowdrop).

There is 2 version combo as our starters are mainly on the semi/limited list. First, I will explain the longer version since it is our main goal and better disruption. The starter is Tour Guide/Scorpio. Tour Guide ss Sangan, make Cherubini, use Chrubini dump Naturia Rosewhip, use Sangan add Arboria, ss Arboria make Halqifibrax. The Predap Scorpio one, use Scorpio ss Cobra, use Cobra add Instant Fusion, use Instant Fusion ss tuner make Halqifibrax. From both route use Halqifibrax ss Deskbot 001 (basically just regular Auroradon combo) make Auroradon, ss 3 tokens, use 001 ss itself make Cthugua, use Auroradon tribute 2 tokens ss Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, use Coltwing ss 2 tokens, use 001 ss itself again make another Cthugua, make Strenae using 2 Cthugua and draw for 2, use Strenae add Rosewhip from GY. From here Snowdrop can tribute Strenae to ss itself and Rosewhip, then Strenae will trigger and summoning Teardrop with plant material. Then we can synchro summon the lv3 token + Rosewhip (depends on you, since Rosewhip is a Winda for s/t which is kinda good) for Marjoram, use Marjoram add Blessed Winds as disruption and recovery card.

The shorter version is basically if we cant Cherubini before Halqifibrax, meaning we wont have access to Rosewhip, so after summoning Snowdrop together with other plant, we use Snowdrop and targeting itself making all plant lv8, resulting us with 2 Teardrops which isnt very bad (maybe).

Since the engine takes space and Rikka has summoning restriction, we only play the good Rikka (in my opinion), being the 9 cards I mentioned + Rikka Tranquility (can summon Rikka or Rosewhip from GY, only tribute monster after we used its disruption tho) and Rikka Sheet (kinda bad but searchable, just a bootleg Impermanence or Widow Anchor).

The combo lineup: 2 Cobra and 2 Coltwing (we need our combo to succeed, cus if it fails its just zero board presence, also Cobra is a plant target for Snowdrop despite being a once per duel effect), 3 Sangan (1 card Halqifbrax by searching Arboria or handtrap if we have Arboria), 3 Arboria (most of our low level can go to Almiraj, playing 3 Arboria makes them less bricky), Naturia Rosewhip (thank God Konami printed level 3 tuner plant with good effect), Spore (just there, bootleg Glow-up Bulb), and the remaining combo pieces is self explanatory.

The rest of main deck is just Crossout package which can function as handtrap or prevention getting handtrapped.

The extra deck: Just combo pieces with some breaking board follow-up plays. PK Break Sword (as we can recycle our level 3 engine with Blessed Winds, this one I think is a good choice), Borreload Dragon (non-targeting non-destruction monster removal), Accesscode (easy access from our leftover like Auroradon), Knightmares (deck is tight, you can try switching).

Expected end board:

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/gQNNJtp.png"" alt=""image"" />

Replay: <a>https://bit.ly/2Vora6r</a> (trigger warning: the Eldlich doenst read Accescode, for some reason I entered a room with only 4 cards in starting hand like wtf)

Pros: Super consistent with one card starter, fresh first turn board, able to go second thanks to Crossout package and Rikka xyz, great recursion thanks to Marjoram/Blessed winds, easier access to handtrap thanks to 2 draws from Chtugua and Sangan search.

Cons: Not very strong board, our recursion source is very fragile (face-up and a backrow too)."

The general game-plan is much the same (so the tips below are still valid), but I feel the current list is a bit more appropriate for actual competitive play.</strong></span>

&nbsp;

This deck is designed to have a great deal of versatility whether going first or second, although ideally you will go first.

Going first your goal is to get Eldlich on the field backed by some backrow, as well as to hopefully get the Dogmatika Saint on the field with Fleur in hand and Punishment set. To accomplish this, Nadir lets you mill the Bastard dragon to search out Saint, who you then normal summon to search Punishment. In the end phase, Bastard triggers to get you Fleur in hand, allowing you to set up multiple disruptions with a single card at no cost. Eldlich is then either searched, milled or summoned off of Black Awakening to make your Golden Land traps live. If you can't get Eldlich out instantly, sitting on Scarlet Sanguine is acceptable since you can just summon Eldlich instantly on your opponent's turn with that anyway. In order to make the best use of Scarlet Sanguine and a Golden Land trap, be sure to chain Scarlet Sanguine to the desired Golden Land (for instance, activate Conquistador <em>thenÂ </em>Scarlet, thus making Conquistador's ""destroy a face-up card"" effect live on resolution). Going first is ideal since the deck is largely trap-based, but thanks to Eldlich's hand effect and the board-breaking utility of Dogmatika, going second is also a solid option for the deck even without siding.

For going second, getting Eldlich into your hand is a priority since he sets up your GY while also removing threats. Nadir allows you to both pop a card with N'tss and search out Saint, who searches out Fleur for additional negation and beatdown power. Impermanence is present to serve as a potential disruption during turn 1 and can be replaced with basically any hand trap, but the utility of Impermanence makes it stronger against the plethora of Ash Blossom-resistant decks that now exist. Thanks to Eldlich being a level 10, you also have fairly easy access to notable Rank 10s such as Gustav Max and Liebe to help with OTKing (though be aware Disciple and Saint lock you out of the Extra Deck for the turn after you use them).

All in all this deck has incredible resource management, solid disruption and good damage output. Thanks to Eldlich the deck is overall quite resistant to hand traps and board wipes. The Dogmatika engine is a bit more fragile, but offers additional disruption for essentially no cost and helps tremendously with board-breaking and OTKing."

Two Sacred Beasts with their total of 8000 attack points are impeccable in terms of offense and defence. <em>Fallen Paradise</em> offers protection and card draw. Gathering all these cards on board can be achieved even in the first turn depending on your starting hand. I aimed to make it consistent as possible.

Stick Jowgen with protection, or grind the game to a halt with Mystic Mine.","Spellbook deck for April 2020. The goal is to turbo Jowgen the Spiritualist to lock opponents out of special Summoning, equip him with battle protection from Power of the Guardians, and grind games to a halt.

There's a very small package of monsters, with the vast majority of the deck being spells. 3 Magicians' Souls serve as draw power, this deck is pretty good at taking advantage of Spellbooks in the GY, but more importantly, this lets you filter through cards you don't need to dig to your floodgates, which are how you win the game. You have the advantage of naturally wanting to run 1 High Priestess of Prophecy anyways, which you can send off of this and reanimate with Spellbook of Life. High Priestess is a beater with a half-decent removal. It's a good way to pop backrow and it gives you some sort of way to beat over bigger monsters your opponent might normal summon.

There are, of course, 3 Jowgen. Since you can't search this card, the goal is to dig for him. The deck has a lot of filtering and drawing that you can pull off all in one turn, and it's not unusual to see half of your deck in the first turn, meaning you have reasonably good odds of drawing him. His board wipe ability is icing that makes him less dead going second.

We've got a full playset of Blue Boy, Spellbook Magician of Prophecy. This card has the spellbook name, which is relevant for some spellbook effects, and also searches any of your spellbook cards. This can search for Secrets, and secrets can search for this, giving you a lot of deck thinning abilities. It does suck using your normal summon for him, since it locks you out of Jowgen for the turn, but the set up with this card is real and it's an obvious 3 of.

The deck runs several field spells. 2 copies of Mystic Mine are super clutch. Since this deck wins by grinding games to a halt, you have a good go second option when things are protected from Jowgen's field wipe ability. The deck also runs 2 Demise of the Land and 1 Metaverse, so you can drop Mystic Mine on your opponent after they've summoned their second monster to basically end their turn. Those searchers can also find out other field spells, 1 Secret Village of Spellcasters and 1 Grand Spellbook Tower. Secret Village of Spellcasters is super deadly against any deck reliant on spells, such as fusion decks (Shaddolls, HERO) or spell-spam decks (True Draco, Skystriker). You have to decide which floodgate is better, but having extra field spells to use to turn your Mine off is also helpful. The Spellbook Tower is... fine. It recycles Spellbook cards and can let you draw an extra card per turn, which is nice, especially for a grindy deck, but we've got better field spells in most matchups.

We've got a single copy of One Day of Peace and a single Upstart Goblin. One Day of Peace just gives you that one turn to set up, while also increasing the consistency of the deck, which Upstart is solely a small consistency boost. The deck is geared towards drawing 4 each turn with the spellbook combo, so the more card draw I could add to that the more consistently I could stick a Jowgen. The One Day of Peace has seriously impressed me, it really takes the pressure off and lets me use Blue Boy to search.

For spellbooks, We've got 3 Secrets, 3 Knowledge, and 2 Master. If you use Knowledge first and then the Master you can draw 4 - its also possible to use Blue Boy to find Secrets (or vice versa), find Master, search Knowledge, and then draw 2, getting an extra search out of it. This plus Magicians' Souls is the deck's bread and butter.

We've also got 2 copies of Spellbook of Eternity, to recycle our spellbooks (works sort of like a combo extender in the deck) and 3 copies of Spellbook of Fate. Spellbook of Fate banishes 1 card without targeting, which is its primary purpose, but I have on occasion used all 3 of its abilities. Good removal is good - using a quickplay spell to banish without targeting is unreal.

We also have the single copies of Spellbook of Life, which helps resurrect either Jowgen or High Priestess, and one copy of Spellbook of Power, which can be copied with Spellbook of the Master to give a creature 2000 Atk points. This can be crucial to help Jowgen beat over bigger normal summoned monsters while searching twice.

For the last maindeck slot we have 3 Solemn Judgement. Half of your life points is nothing compared to stopping that Lightning Storm or other key effect/creature that would out Jowgen.

In the extra deck we have... some stuff. We have every Super Poly target, including a couple weird ones I felt I had space for (super polying 2 Dark Dragons to make Furious might seem on the face of it weaker than Starving Venom, but I like the flexibility). Then we have 2 Crowley, which can work with Blue Boy and Souls to grab another spellbook. We have one of each Link 2 Knightmare for a spot of extra deck removal, and 1 Verte Anaconda to use Super Poly as extra deck removal.

The Side Deck are a bunch of options to break boards in different matchups, so that going second isn't a death sentence."

<strong>Lightsworn: The Deck's History And Strategy</strong>

Who hasn't heard of them before?

Lightsworn Decks aim to send cards from the top of the Deck to the GraveyardÂ and then benefit from sending them there. All Lightsworn monsters (except <em>Wulf, Jenis and Rinyan</em>) mill cards from the top of the Deck to pay the cost for skills or as a requirement at the End Phase. Their monster's effects trigger by either being sent to the graveyard or sending cards to the graveyard - so their GY can basically be seen as their second hand.

The usage of Spells and Traps vary in Lightsworn; many play the 'main starter' spells like<em> Solar Recharge</em> (Discard 1 ''Lightsworn'' monster; draw 2 cards, then send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY) and <em>Charge Of The Light</em> Brigade (Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY; add one 4-â° ''Lightsworn'' monster from your Deck to your hand) - other builds integrate the trap <em>Lightsworn Judgment</em>, which acts as a searcher for <em>Judgment Dragon</em>.
<blockquote><div>The success of the Lightsworn-Decks can be traced back to many different time periods and took many different forms.</div></blockquote>
Back then, Chaos-Lightsworn and <em>That Grass Looks Greener</em>-Turbo-Milling-Decks completely wrecked the meta (despite bricking every second game) with <em>Judgement Dragon</em> being an easily-summoned monster with integretated spot removal (paying 1000 Life Points to destroy all other cards on the field) and high ATK. They synergize with many other archetypes; (Chaos, Twilightsworn, Shaddolls, Lighttray, Dinosaurs, Dragons, e.t.c.) making them capable of uniting all attributes and a lot of different monster types.
<blockquote><div>In the history of YGO, The Lightsworn have been hit badly many times - examples of that being the bans of <em>Fairy Tail - Snow, Black Dragon Collapserpent, Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson, Glow-Up-Bulb, That Grass Looks Greener, Soul Charge, Brilliant Fusion,</em> and <em>Sixth Sense, e.t.c. </em></div></blockquote>
While the TCG-banlist still holds the Lightsworn-players back, the OCG slowly integrated some of Lightsworn's keycards back into the game. Finally, <em>Snow</em> has been unbanned in the recent banlist (OCG, 2020.04) and <em>That Grass Looks Greener</em> is now semi-limited.Â  Lightsworn lately haven't seen a lot of competetive play though, due to their vulnerability to negating effects - and undeniablely, this is the current meta's top priority.
<blockquote><div>To summarise: With great risk often comes great reward.</div></blockquote>
Lightsworn Decks are capable of a very fast OTK - so they easily can push for game with their powerful Boss Monsters - and going through your whole Extra Deck, (in this deck version mainly Synchro-cards like <em>Borreload Savage Dragon</em> or <em>F.A. Dawn Dragster</em> with negating capabilities).

There are failures, setbacks and even complete start-over's along the way; decking out could be a problem for Lightsworns due to milling being your main mechanism. Additionally, Lightsworn Decks rely (sometimes) on the heart of card's (imagine the feeling of bricking with three copies of <em>Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</em> in your starting hand) and are vulnerable to negating effects such as <em>Skill Drain</em>.

&nbsp;

<strong>An Explanation Of The Card Ratios - (TCG-version)</strong>

Here I'll explain why I chose certain card ratios and how I use them. In this variant, you have a Dragon- and Shaddoll-engine, combined with some Dangers; improving the draw power (bricking in Lightsworn sucks, sometimes resulting in an immediate game loss) and consistency. Sometimes, the Shaddoll-Fusion-Cards (<em>El Shaddoll Winda</em>) rescue your life going first, limiting your opponent's special summons.

First, let's look at the most obvious part: The Lightsworn Monsters.
<ul>
 	<li><em>3x Wulf, 3x Raiden, 2x Lumina, 1x Felis, 1x Garoth, 1x Lyla, 1x Minerva, 1x Judgment Dragon</em></li>
</ul>
<em>Raiden</em> and <em>Lumina</em> are the most powerful of the monsters named above: <em>Raiden</em> is a 4-â° Tuner, milling up to twice per turn and enabling synchro plays. <em>Lumina</em> discards one card in your hand and let's you special summon another Lightsworn in your GY, preferablyÂ <em>Raiden</em> to use his milling effect, (or an additional copy of <em>Lumina</em> to revive another Lightsworn monster - it's not a hard once per turn effect).Â  That's why commonly players play both cards at 3. I agree with <em>Raiden</em> being at his highest ratio, because he's our common normal summon, starts combo-plays, and we want t0 see him as often as possible in our starting hand. If we would put <em>Lumina</em> at the same ratio, there's a problem with 'wasting' a normal summon for her and not milling anything in our Main Phase with her effect. We can search her via <em>Charge Of Light Brigade</em> as well, so she's okay at 2 copies.

The Lightsworn cards we want to mill are <em>Wulf, Felis</em> and <em>Minerva</em>. <em>WulfÂ </em>is a 2,1K Beatstick without ability to mill, and is special summoned if it's sent from your Deck to your GY - an unquestionable 3-of. 'A 4th copy of <em>Wulf</em>', you could say, is <em>Felis</em>. She's a 4-â° Tuner and special summoned when sent from the Deck to the GY by a monster effect. The last restriction sucks, (that's why I only play one copy), but her spot removal and milling effect outweighs the bad. Both cards can help you go into Synchro, XYZ- and Link-monsters.

One card, which rarely sees play in Lightsworn Engines is <em>Minerva</em>. She is a 3-â° Tuner, who adds you 1 Light Dragon Monster from your Deck to your hand, (whose Level is less than or equal to the toal number of Lightsworn monsters with different names in your GY), when normal summoned. I understand why <em>Minerva</em> doesn't see a lot of play: <em>Minerva's</em> effect requires you to normal summon her and play a lot of Lightsworn monsters (and them to be in the GY)- and she only mills 2 cards at your End Phase. But her additional effect (...If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the Graveyard: Send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard ...) helps us mill faster and she helps us with bringing out our <em>Judgment Dragon. </em><em>Garoth</em>, <em>Lyla</em> and <em>Judgment Dragon</em> are solid monsters, but I only play each of them at 1 copy to avoid bricking.
<ul>
 	<li><em>2x Shaddoll Beast, 2x Dragon, 2x Hedhehog, 2x Falco, 1x Squamata, 1x Reeshaddoll Wendi</em></li>
</ul>
The effects of the Lightsworn often trigger a variety of other archtepyes (like <em>Shaddoll</em> cards), but always be aware that milling as a cost does not trigger the Shaddoll cards! Except that, Shaddolls are best friends with Lightsworn (and Dangers). They are perfect targets for <em>Allure Of Darkness</em>, give us draw power, and restrict our opponent. Good thing to mention: Their monsters, traps and spells can be revived from the GY.
<ul>
 	<li>1x Wyverbuster, 1x Collapserpent, 2x Starliege Seyfert, 1x Omni Dragon Brotaur, 1x Levianeer</li>
</ul>
A Dragon-Engine, which enables more Extra-Deck plays, especially Links, and brings our beloved <em>Judgment Dragon</em> to our field. Especially <em>Seyfert</em> acts as decent normal summon and searcher, and can banish itself to add 1 Level 8 Light or Dark Dragon from our GY to our hand. Play them, it's worth the money.

The other monster cards in this Deck Build are Dangers, Handtraps (and <em>Gizmek Orochi</em>). One thing to mention about the spells that might surprise you is that I play<em> Solar Recharge</em> just at 2 copies. I don't play a lot of Lightsworn to justify it's highest ratio, and I am fine with using <em>Allure Of Darkness</em>.

<strong>Extra Spice / Deck Ideas</strong>

In the OCG, there's a card named <em>Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Demonic Dragon</em>. It's the BEST Synchro-monster for Lightsworn in a while, because it adds you 1 card to your hand and mills 4 cards. It can revive itself via banishing one Light or Dark monster from your hand or GY - again a perfect opportunity to introduce the next card ...

<em>Nemesys Keystone.</em> Another interesting card to try would be <em>Nemesys Keystone</em> (OCG). It special summons itself from your hand when you shuffle back 1 of your banished monsters - and if this card gets banished, you can add this card to your hand. <em>Nemesys Keystone</em> would be AT LEAST a 1 of for sure. Maybe I would trade it for <em>Minerva</em>.

<p><em>I want to premise that it is a complicated combo and above all that it's not always the same, the key moments are the beginning, and in fixing the final board. For these reasons I am not writing the combo step by step, it would be useless, if you want a visual proof as an example, look at the video you find just above the decklist.</em></p>
<strong>The Beginning:</strong>
<p>With the new additions, the combo start is very similar to a Dragon Link deck, subsequently our intent is to summon the Guardragon and then <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, after that our aim is to summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> (doesn't necessarily have to be summoned at this very moment) to send cards to the graveyard and add a light/dark in hand.</p>
<p>We summon <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> 2 times (sometimes only 1 is enough) to draw cards, and in the meantime send as many cards as possible to the graveyard. This is the preparation for the final board which varies according to the cards in hand and the graveyard.</p>
<strong>Final Board:</strong>
<p>Usually with the second <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> I like to summon <a data-name=""Lumina, Twilightsworn Shaman"">Lumina, Twilightsworn Shaman</a> from the hand while continuing with it. If you have enough monstersÂ you could adopt to summon <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> in addition to the other usual negate.</p>
<p>Make sure you have <a data-name=""Galactic Spiral Dragon"">Galactic Spiral Dragon</a> at the graveyard to summon Monster rank 8.</p>
<p><em><strong>Usually the final board is:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord + </a><a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>.</strong></em></p>


<hr />

<em><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong></em>

Initially if you can start with the dragon link combo, try not to send too many cards to the graveyard from Lightsworn effects so as not to risk sending to the gy cards we need to complete the combo, fill the graveyard then that, be careful not to remove too many cards from the game, there must always be several monsters in the graveyard.

If you need a monster in your hand but you haven't drawn it so far, you can summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> to try to find it among those 5 cards.

If we have <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a> and Absorouter Dragon in hand we can discard it by cost, triggering its effect, to add <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a><a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">,</a>Â <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a><a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon""> or </a><a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> in hand.

<a data-name=""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon"">Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon</a> is essential to recover the removed cards, especially when they are banned from <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>.

<td><strong>CONSIDERATIONS</strong></td>

</table>
<strong>The Deck:</strong>

As much as it is a particular deck it's quite balanced, even when you have bad hands, you still manage to get away with it.

The deck if it's not interrupted by negations really manages to put the opponent in difficulty, but we know it's almost impossible. Well, if it manages to send cards to the graveyard even with negations, this deck doesn't have too many problems to go on.

Since the deck sends many cards to the graveyard it's not safe to play many spells,also because those spells in the gy have no use, instead you need light and dark monsters to be removed from the game, to summon our dragons from the hand.

<strong>The Cards</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Lightsworn's cards are fundamental to send as many cards to the graveyard as possible and thanks to <a data-name=""Solar Recharge"">Solar Recharge</a> we can also draw 2 cards

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>, maybe is the best card of the deck, manages to give the deck a lot of stability, ensuring that you have some main cards in your hand, as well as letting you discard a card and then draw another.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Lightpulsar Dragon"">Lightpulsar Dragon</a> is very important not only to summon Chaos Ruler with the help of <a data-name=""Plaguespreader zombie"">Plaguespreader zombie</a> and <a data-name=""Galaxy Serpent"">Galaxy Serpent</a> ,but with this card u and you can take advantage of its 3 effects.You can easily summon it and use it to send cards to the graveyard ,moreover you can Summon <a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon King of Atum"">Hieratic Dragon King of Atum</a>.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, it's an excellent card because you can search for practically all the dragons you need, and when it is in your Gy u can banish it to add to your hand <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Emperor, The Dragon of Armageddon"">Chaos Emperor, The Dragon of Armageddon</a>.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, this is a really good card, i normally use it to destroy 2 cards on the field and above all to special summon Monsters from the graveyard like <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a> or 1 of 3 tuner Monsters. If u start for first u can use it to shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand into the deck.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Demonic Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Demonic Dragon</a>, The new support that has improved the deck a lot. Even if the first thing to do is to fill the graveyard, try to summon it after the main combo or in any case after having already a good number of cards in the graveyard. The card is not difficult to summon and when it drops on the field in addition to sending cards to the gy it allows you to choose one of those monsters and add it to your hand. Also when you recall it from the gy with its own effect, use it to summon a rank 8 xyz.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><span><em>So... Have you to start for first or for second?</em></span></p>
You can do both very well, obviously having cards with a high attack value is could start for seconds, but you are more likely to be annoyed by your opponent. And if you start first you can play the part of the annoying opponent. Usually is better start for first in this meta.
<table>

<tr>
<td><span>SIDE DECK</span></td>
</tr>

</table>
<p><b>Must Have:</b></p>
<a data-name=""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"">Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju</a> is the only dark Kaiju monster can be used. Its use is obviously very basic, you can easily get rid of an opposing monster, as well as summon it if there is already a Kaiju on the opposing field. We usually prefer its against decks that have 1 major monster boss, like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.

or

<a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> it's a really strong card against combo decks, if he can't get negation before 5 summon, our opponent most of the time, will pass the turn immediately after.

<a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> is a really strong ht in this meta, it hurts Dino, Invoked, Virtual World, Eldlich, Dragon Link, Infernoble Knight and other . It is also light, which is important.

<a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> is excellent because in addition to <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, the deck has difficulty breaking opposing spells or traps, and the effect is also activated from the graveyard. It also has a beautiful interaction with <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</a> which, through its effect in the opponent's turn, allows us to choose a Galaxy card from the deck and add it in hand or attach it as material to it.

<a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a> we use it to go first having more stability, especially if we are afraid of a possible opponent's <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> ,with this card we can advance the combo a minimum, without having to ban cards.

<hr />
<p><b>Other cards that may be useful:</b></p>
<a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a> together with <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> helps us against control decks, in fact if we manage to summon it our opponent will not be able to set cards nor activete s/t that are set on the field. Let's try to protect it with cards like <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> or <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres.</a>

<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> is an excellent card that allows us, to return resources to the deck as well as to draw 2 cards. It can be played in a version of the deck, that doesn't focus too much on the otk but tries to play for more turns.

<a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a> is an excellent beatdown monster, that is easily summoned even by using most of the high level to make it not targetable.

Welcome to Hamon Control. This deck will be based on the new support in the sacred beast structure deck coming to the tcg on July 10, 2020.

&nbsp;

This deck aims to go first and set up Hamon and Raviel with the field spell and New trap card that works as a One sided skill drain! (This is an early build and can still likely be made more consistent)

The new ""Dark Beckoning Beast"" is your bread and butter! Seeing that plus any other of your summoning beasts OR the New search spell ""Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed""Â  is a two card combo that will end you on both Sacred Beasts and the field spell at the very least, meaning you will often have 3 other cards in your hand plus a draw 2 to continue your plays.

If you want more consistency over stun capability you can try removing the artifact engine and adding in a few more dangers, as well as foolish burial goods to the deck. Personally, I add level 8 dangers so I can also utilize Trade-in. Foolish burial goods is used to send your ""Cerulean Skyfire"" to the grave so that Your searcher can bring it back to hand.

When being forced to go second in games 2 and 3 it may be wise to drop the artifact package as well as the solemns for some more board clearing capabilities. Evenly Matched, Lightning Storm, and Super Polymerization are your big equalizers. Despite having to give up your battle-phase to resolve evenly matched it will more often than not result in you being able to build a full board while making it almost impossible for your opponent to recur those banished cards. As a reminder for going second, after activating dark summoning beast's ability to summon from hand/deck you will not be able to attack for the rest of the turn. However, if you are able to mount a board presence you may still use your battle phase <strong>Before</strong> you use this effect.

Since all of the cards in the archetype are searchable it may not be necessary to have them run at 3, however they can be easily disrupted by the likes of Infinite impermanence and other hand traps, so be weary and bring along some called by the graves if you find it too troublesome.

Good Luck, and have fun!"

When going first, it has access to half the combo of the Infinite Negates build (Simorgh, Infinity, Apex Avian) which makes a very good 2-Negate 1st turn board.

It is fairly consistent and its easy access to Black Whirldwind and Allure of Darkness helps the situation a lot.

The Deck rarely bricks, but when it does it's an instant loss (the majority of the times).

And it's fragile playstyle does not help either when the player draws bad hands.

Overall, the deck is extremely fun to play but besides the most versatile build, it is definitely not a top contender.

<strong>Raviel OTK</strong>

This is a going Second deck based on getting out Raviel and OTK'ing using the new ""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Heaven Crushing Fist"" monster to work as an ""honest"" effect, doubling your attack points and attacking all monsters your opponent controls.

This deck is pretty consistent as most of the cards search each other and can summon Raviel in many ways. Dark Beckoning Beast plus ""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"" is a two card combo that will end on Raviel on field with Fallen Paradise as well as a link-2. Pentestag for piercing, and Knightmare phoenix for board clearing.

Phantom Skyblaster plus any special summoned monster will get you a Saryuja Skulldread which will allow you to extend even further.

<strong>Card Choice</strong>

Card choice is highly interchangeable, in order to fit the current meta.

The most notable ""upgrade"" would be replacing Twin Twisters with Lightning Storm adding more versatility to clearing boards while going second.

This deck suffers pretty greatly from hand traps/Search negates. The evil hero isn't the most useful card in the deck and the spells are searchable you can consider cutting 1 of the field spell as well as the Seven Gates to add in 3 Called by the grave if you're worried about getting hit with disruption. Alternatively you could replace one of the evil hero's with a Danger!? Jackalope? for some more consistency.

The danger package here seems odd at first glance, but it is meant to give more fiend materials on board as well as add draw power to the deck. Nessie! will allow you to add a Chupacabra to hand if it is hit with its own effect. Additionally, adding jackalope will allow you to summon a Chupacabra from deck if you wish to add that as well.

Super Polymerization is essential for clearing opponents monsters that will prevent you from searching or using other card effects. That along with Predaplant Dragostepalia clears The Mechaba Winda Lock with ease. This is also run with 2 Starving venom fusion dragon to help clear the abundance of dark monsters in the game.

&nbsp;

<strong>Side Deck</strong>

The side deck has been construced for going first in game 2 or 3 in matches Since Hamon uses essentially the same engine as Raviel, you can switch up your strategy to a control variant on the fly. If you choose to, you can also use the sacred beast trap card that works as a one sided skill drain if you have 2 different beasts on the field, however this can be a little less consistent to pull off so I opted for solemn judgement instead. Artifact package should also be able to shut down most opponents who attempt to break your board using the extra deck.

Note* This side deck is totally optional, removing The Hamon package can make your side deck more potent for specific threats in the meta."

I'm not a pro player, so i'm open to feedback!
This deck in general is focused in Link summon and XYZ. Maybe you guys can remove some of the alien monsters to add some generic or alien spell and trap cards.
The side deck have some cards to help more in XYZ summon, more cards to have fun and more synchro cards to the synchro summon. This side deck is very relative..."

","<em><strong>Rokket Dragons</strong></em>

This deck can either go first or second. Going first and going full combo will end on board with Borreload Savage Dragon at 4200ATK with 3 negates, a Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres which will act as a disruption and tribute into Amorphage Goliath which will lock your opponent out of the Extra Deck(and yourself but stopping your opponent from doing anything is the strategy). Going second you can easily link climb into a Borrelsword Dragon and a Borreload Savage Dragon for a quick OTK. The deck doesn't use too many resources so even if you go full combo first you still have most your extra deck and main deck.

I played a variant of Traptrix i call Synchro Traptrix, i played it due to my liking of the Traptrix playstyle with its high consistency and access to powerful trap holes and advantage loops with Sera. However, i felt the deck lacked a strong finisher and method to pressure the opponent so i added several 1 card synchro and XYZ engines, like Oviraptor and Assault to summon strong boss monsters.

What tech choices did you play?

The Lefty and Righty Driver package to make Herald of the Arc Light, Red Blossoms from Underroot and Treacherous Trap Hole were my main tech choices

How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?

I prepared by including a range of tech options strong against meta decks such as the above techs to counter Hero Shaddoll by preventing Shaddoll Fusion or Vyon by banishing cards or by banishing shaddoll fusion or a fusion monster by Blossom, plus Treacherous to serve as a powerful turn 1 option to blow up unprepared boards. I would definitely cut the Drivers, they felt very underpowered with Arc Light being too small to stop the opponent simply running it over before committing, and reallocate some traps to include new cards such as Snowflower Sheet.

How were your matchups? A had a range of good and bad matchups, most notably Unchained which i could counter with the wide assortment of GY hate and banishing methods to limit their recursion, however, i eventually got knocked out by the winning Spyral deck where i was unable to deal with the constant destruction a Sleeper offered. However, even in bad matchups, i could grab wins through Utopia Double granting me some wins i very much did not deserve.

I played Shaddoll Hero ABC Chaos. I wanted to play Shaddoll Heroes this month cause the deck seemed broken. I hadn't played trinity in a bit but, luckily my friend, Anim7ed, had an amazing list that he gave me.

What tech choices did you play? Two tweaks I made to Anim7ed's deck were to add in Danger! Bigfoot and Abominable Unchained Soul. Danger! Bigfoot worked out pretty well since this deck has a lot of discard and Bigfoot often was the best discard since you get to destroy a card. Abominable Unchained was amazing. He was easy to summon and whenever he was summoned, he swung the game in my favor.

How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward? I did not prep for the meta but, the deck made by Anim7ed was so strong that it plowed through other decks. There are two things I would change about the deck. The first change is I would add more chaos elements to the deck to which would trigger Eclipse Wyvern more. The second change would be to take out the equip sub-theme. The only good equip in the deck was premature burial and it wasn't good enough to warrant 2 bad equips and 2 equip searchers.

How were your matchups?

The insane value that the deck generated beat most decks. The two decks I struggled with were Mika's Zoodiacs and KrasherV's Spyrals. Mika's Zoos banished a lot of my cards with Whiptail's effect which hurt my recursion and had a lot of disruption. KrasherV's Spyrals establishes threats early and then ends the game when he sets up Sleeper + Last Resort which never leaves room for the dawdling of my deck."

","<strong>Lair Infernoid going 2nd deck build.</strong>

I don't main pot of extravagance because I prefer to run three copies of evenly matched, which is absolutely amazing going 2nd, and to not limit the void imagination-infernoid tierra power, which is one of the win condition.

Crusadia equimax is also a win condition because you can use it to OTK, simply using an infernoid monster to tribute it in battle phase, after you attaced with it.

Lair of darkness is really helpfull, both with infernoid monsters and monster gate, which is really good to out your opponesnt's monsters and mill some cards.

For the hand traps I run gammas and impermanences. Evenly matched is the only trap.

If you lose game 1 and you think your opponent is going to let you going first, it is a good idea to side the other two void feasts, which are great to activate in your opponent's draw phase/standby phase to set two negations on the field.

Void imagination is, of course, the strongest card in the deck. You always want to resolve it because you can mill three elder entitys with tierra to pop three cards and you send a lot of infernoids to gy as materials. However you have to side them out, maybe for void feasts, against decks that don't use the extra deck."
