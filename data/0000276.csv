A 5 card Albaz engine is added, mostly to keep the deck cheaper, but these can be replaced with staple cards like Accesscode, Apollousa, and Dragoon, which I reccommend as Albaz does not flow well with the deck."

Here's a Pendulum player's best attempt.</span></strong></span></p> <strong>Overview:</strong>  <span>Endymagician as an archetype is all about board control, whether it be through monster, spell, or omni negates, big bodies, or protection. Using its mechanic of Spell counters as a resource, and using Magician support as half the deck to allow for an explosive, versatile extra deck, full of outs to almost anything, or O/FTK potential to weak boards. All this said, the deck is relatively weak to certain hand traps, moreso than some other pendulum decks thanks to Maxx C, and properly evaluating the absolute value of every card is a must.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Key Cards/Combos:</strong>  <span>HARMONIZING IS GOATED. This card as long as you have scales, is basically a Baronne for free, able to special summon any magician from your deck. Oafdragon for Baronne, anyone else for your rank 4 Xyzs and Lvl 8 Synchros. Alternatively, she can pull out anything for your Electrum engine.</span>  <span>ASTROGRAPH IS GOATED. Kind of a garnet if drawn, but if you're at all familiar with this card, you'll know why. But to put it simply, it makes the Electrum engine work. </span>  <span>Electrum, put Astro to the extra deck, Electrum effect, destroy something perishable, Astro to the hand, Astro effect summons him, puts thing you destroyed to hand (if theres another copy in the deck) Link out Selene using Electrum and anything you want, typically Astro, Selene effect, Link out I:P if you have the monsters, Link out Avram or Access depending on board with I:P + Selene.</span>  <span>Endymion has the longest card text in YuGiOh, so here's an unofficial errata: in the P-zone he is an 8 scale that can take 6 spell counters from your side of the field to special summon him out, if you do this you can destroy cards equal to the number of cards that may have spell counters on them (you MUST destroy atleast one card.) and while he's a monster, he's a spell negate! the cost for the negate is to return a card that has spell counters on it to the hand, but once you do, those spell counters get put on Endymion himself. (yes he can target himself to be bounced if you need) and this is of course once per turn. Once he has spell counters on him, he gains target and destruction protection from card effects, and if he dies, he's a normal spell tutor. He kind of does alot.</span>  <span>Jackal King is a monster negate as long as you have 2 spell counters somewhere, and he gains 2 spell counters for every spell played, not just one. Kiiiiinda really useful~</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Conclusion:</strong>  <span>This was my first deck in Master Duel, and YuGiOh as a whole, so its kind of special to me personally, but its of course far from perfect, you will need to faf about with it a bit depending on what you like or need in your collection of archetypes. I come from Magic and Hearthstone, so Value/Control decks are some of my favourites, i tried to give this deck high value options for such a reason. If you have questions just ask, ill happily try my best to give you a proper answer ^-^ &lt;3</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I occasionally do Master Duel on my YT too~ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuaotx691PPQgCnSS-jrdg</span>"

Not much in-depth discussion this time, just wanna keep it short and sweet.","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Darklord Despia list for Master Duel because I legitimately forgot if I've already sent one or not yet but anyway, yeah.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>I mean... it's strong and it has thematic synergies that make them work together well. It's a really aggressive and oppressive deck if able to set up correctly, which shouldn't be a problem. Anyway, the list. Also, I'll just discuss the cards that need explanation and not the entire details of the list because, they should already be pretty understandable. Also I'm only playing 3 Alubers because I can, if there's a better option for this slot, I would cut one for a room.</span>  <span><strong>The only tech option that I will discuss today is this:</strong></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a></strong> - <span>In my Darklord Despia Shaddolls list (if I was already able to post it here), this was Shaddoll Fusion and Shaddoll monsters as targets. But basically, it's just Branded Fusion at home. This is not a new tech choice for Darklords/Despias, in fact I've just been tinkering with this but haven't played the game due to how unfun it is. Normal Summon her, bin either Kristya, Lancea, or Scythe to the GY with her effect, then make The First Darklord. Speaking of which, the targets:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a></strong> - <span>It's a floodgate that prevents Special Summoning, and thanks to The First Darklord, it cannot be <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>-d.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a></strong> - <span>It's, again, a floodgate that prevents Special Summoning, although its effect has to be activated, but who cares. The First Darklord's effect prevents it from being targeted.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong> - <span>It's another free floodgate that prevents banishing for the turn. If you have access to this and Artifact Scythe or Kristya, then it's a guaranteed win unless they specifically have <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>If you can set up Scythe and Kristya in the GY going first, you already pretty much won the game. Also Konami, Ad Libitum of Despia where? An actual ban list where? Side decking where? OCG omegalul, uhh... Best of 1 format bad, what else... Can't wait for Normal Summon Aleister festival, bottom text, YEP. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: This list now also includes the DPE engine, a minor increase in ratio to fit certain tech options to adapt to the changes like Greater Polymerization.</span>"

Borrelend Dragon, the Boss Monster of the Deck, is a very strong card that just got printed in the TCG, and is not yet available in Master Duel as of right now, as it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect, nor can it be targeted, meaning that the only outs to it are a Kaiju monster or a non-targeting absorption effect, such as Underworld Goddess of the Closed Word, and by negating an Effect Monster, permanently, can simultaneously Special Summon a Rokket from the Graveyard.  A lot of cards in the deck lock you into Dark monsters from the Extra Deck, so I would recommend making Romulus quickly, as Dragon Ravine is a great card for any Dragon-based deck since it was first printed, or if you need to make a Halqifibrax combo to get started you should to it early in your turn.  Chaos Ruler is a very important card for this deck, and is fortunately a Dragon, as loading up the Graveyard is nothing but an advantage for this deck.  For the decklist, we have a Rokket package of 1x Absorouter, 2x Tracer, 1x Synchron, 1x Boot Sector, 3x Quick Launch, 1x Borreload Savage, 1x Borrelend, 3x Striker. A typical Chaos package for Dragon Link in 2x Collapserpent, 2x Wyverburster, 3x Starliege, 3x Chaos Space, and 1x Chaos Ruler. Standard Dragon support cards in 3x Noctovision, 1x Chamber and 2x Tidying(for a small Dragonmaid package), 1x Romulus and 1x Dragon Ravine, and 1x Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. We have 3x Ash Blossom, 2x Ghost Belle, 3x Maxx C, and 2x Veiler for Handtraps, 2x Called by the Gravefor Anti-Handtraps, 1x Destrudo and 1x Shooting Riser, 1x Dragon Buster and 1x Union Carrier(Because this card is somehow not banned yet in MD), 1x Avarice, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Triple Burst, 1x Accesscode, 1x Halqifibrax, and 1x Hieratic Spheres.  Overall, the deck is very strong, very consistent, and shows that it deserves to be considered a meta deck in this format."

Get your cook (Number 59: Crooked Cook) out and wait for the Exodia pieces. While you wait for the Exodia pieces, you can use the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus for clearing opponent threats. The Metalfoes Fusion is in this deck for Summoner Monk fuel, and to give additional draws (since you constantly will have 7 or more cards in your hand at the end of your turn), while also being a wait to protect yourself from a deck out. (Alternatively use Marron if you are scared of decking out) The Summoner Monk is probably the weirdest card in this deck, since you can't make Crooked Cook with him and the Right-Hand Shark, but then it is a good thing Buzzsaw Shark is a Level 4. Just summon him, make Almiraj with the Summoner Monk, tribute that monster of for it's effect, (which does nothing) then summon Right-Hand Shark and lastly the Cook. Another thing to note about this deck is, it doesn't care about Maxx ""C"", or to be more precise does it not affect this deck's gameplan at all. The opponent can get 4 free draws, and we won't care. Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler are the big hand trap counters to this deck, so hit them with Called By The Grave and Crossout Designator. As for the Extra Deck. Well, just fill it up with the cards you think will counter you. You only need 1-3 Crooked Cooks, and 1-2 Salamangreat Almirajs. The rest of the space can be used to whatever.  As for the weaknesses for this deck. There are a lot, but bricking is happily not one of them. (the deck has 13 cards that lead to cook, so that gives you a 10% chance of bricking) Kaijus are the biggest counter to this deck. A single Kaiju will make you forfeit, since you have no counter to it. Piercing and direct attacks are another big one, but the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus should help somewhat with those.  As for the matchups, we have Toons, Prank Kids and Blue-Eyes Max builds as the worst. The only thing stopping a Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon in this deck is a Kaiju, but you will still take 7600 HP damage from a single attack, so you only get 1 turn to draw the Kaiju, if it is not already in your hand. On the other hand, does some decks not have a single out for this deck. I am talking about Drytron, Adamancipators, Virtual World esc.  As for a funny idea. I worked a bit on this myself, but found Exodia to be better. Final Countdown is another great win condition for this kind of deck. Crooked Cook is all about stalling, and why not let the 20 turns for Final Countdown tick down while you stall. You will only give your opponent 20 turns to find a counter, but most meta decks will have fount their counter within 5-10 turns, so your choice. If you chose to pick Final Countdown, will i recommend removing Metalfoes Fusion and possibly Summoner Monk, since you won't need the draw power anymore, and Summoner Monk becomes somewhat less useful without the Metalfoes Fusion. (Swap Summoner Monk out with Silent Angler and you won't feel a difference)"

Hordes of Demons, Superpowerful Dragons, Masters of Arcane Arts,  Or a single girl (with friends) in a mech suit? My money is on Raye, since she is more powerful than ever with an arsenal of 15 blind second cards!  &nbsp;  The philosophy with blind second Sky Strikers is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game. This deck has cards specifically picked out for the May 2022 meta, like Triple Tactics Talent (super good since everyone uses Branded, Flundereeze, and handtraps, etc). Evenly Matched obliterates most duelists this format since they spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to one card. Many boards are made to counter/negate monsters, but hardly anything (except Wandering Gryphon Rider) negates spell/trap effects! The current meta is easy pickings for blind second strategies, and Sky Striker is one fo the decks can make use of this style to its full potential.  When your opponent forces you to go 1st thinking all you do is spam ""Raigeki"" and ""Evenly Matched,"" metagame them by siding in devastating floodgates!  If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet, clear the board with Raye's besties Accesscode Talker and Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer!  &nbsp;  And remember duelists... RAYE IS BAYE!!!  &nbsp;  If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!"

No questions asked  ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=u8SC25-8zN0&amp;t=762s )  So to Answer anyone's question on how far we (the players) can expand the everlasting length of the Branded-Despia Pantheon, this here is my mark. I have been playing Yu-Gi-Oh in all forms for over fifteen years, and to say the innovation of homebrew deckbuilding has been toppled by handtraps, generic staples, and banlist forged by incompetent corporate synicism is an understatement. Today I'm gonna challenge myself even further by making a collaboration of 4 different engines into one deck (5 if we are counting Branded, but turns out it was never a real engine at all). Turns out that even though the excessive milling was indeed the price to pay for Lightsworns, the addition of such isn't as bad as I thought.  For starters, what I first learnt from all this was the ease of getting both <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn </a>and almost all the necessary Fusion monsters needed to fulfill your board building adventures (such as <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a> ). Next comes the Chaos package; which (while not as big as intended) fits really well with both the Despia and Lightsworn engines with little problems (except for occasions to where you might need <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levaineer"">Chaos Dragon Levaineer</a>, and either <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a> or <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>). Adventurer lineup for this deck is the normal lineup you would expect in just about any of the Adventurer-Despia builds since it's inception, and nothing has really changed regarding the lineup (until the release of the card, <a data-name=""Illegal Knight"">Illegal Knight</a> from the set, Dimension Force). Finally the addition of some notable spell cards for this variant which includes <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>, <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a>, and <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>.  Now we go on to the Extra Deck, which I mentioned earlier has the intention of giving me the ease of accessing the monsters with little issues. First in foremost this gives two options of either going into <a data-name=""Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn</a> or <a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a>; and while both do their milling jobs at a rate where it doesn't drain your decks too badly. <a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a> can be a lot more situational at times (especially against other Despian or Branded players), while <a data-name=""Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn</a> gives you a +1 for every Lightsworn milled from your deck (and can destroy cards on the field up to number of them milled if she is destroyed by battle or by card effect). Then where <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> comes in is that is searches a copy of <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> for a very up and coming fusion monster <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> (which requires 3 materials; but 1 from each your hand and field, and then you can draw/destroy cards up to the number of materials used from either side). Alongside that is the usual batch of Albaz Dragons commonly seen in most Branded builds with the addition of <a data-name=""Despia Quaeritis"">Despia Quaeritis</a> and <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a> for the Despians.  Finally comes the link monsters that (while not making the most significant impact) still play a decent part in making some gains on both ends on the board. First and foremost we have the strongest of the elemental Chamers, <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> (played to snag Dark monsters from your opponents GY to use against them or to use them as fodder to fusion summoning with the Branded Dragons). Next in line is the familiar, but obscure Link-3 monster, <a data-name=""Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion</a> (recovers a card from the GY if destroyed and is a foolish burial on it's summon; but if a card is sent to the GY by an effect, it mills 3 cards from your deck). Finally comes the aforementioned Link-1 monster <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> (which is just an extender piece that is currently used to get off of your Adventurer token into any of the other 2 Link monsters I already mentioned).  &nbsp;"

Including Deus X-Krawler from just one Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-knight. Krawler Soma is just such a great card and it really makes the deck shine. Sol and Luna is also a great card. It can disrupt opponent's plays by putting their monsters face-down adn triggering your Krawler Flip effects. It can also along with World Legacy Pawns flip Krawlers face-up when opponent is targeting face down Krawlers with removal effects, triggering the Krawler monsters' special summoning effect. I decided to drop World Legacy in Shadow from the final build because it sometimes bricked and usually was just foing nothing except being a target for opponent's spell and trap removal. And nasty surprise fo people who don't read. Nibiru the Primal Being is an especially great card for this deck as it does not tribute face-down monsters. You can just wipe opponent's field with it while still maintaining face-down krawlers. Also opponent cannot really use nibiru on you for the same reason.

Dragon Ravine itself has searchers and searchers for those searchers so you have a plan for anything. And that's the best thing about this deck, your never restricted to one combo and chokepoint.

(Ft. Magistus)","Hello everybody!. As you may or may not know, months ago was released some support to the Witchcrafters archetype that is yet to arrive to the TCG, but we may as well start doing some recipes and experimentations beforehand.  Sadly, even though the new Witchcrafter Fusion Monster is a solid option to build a deck around, the Fusion Spell Card is really underwhelming (<strong>we are talking about a slow-searchable polymerization</strong>). so, i've been looking around the other spellcaster archetypes and found out that a Magistus package works wonders in this deck!.  <em><strong>What does the ""Magistus Package"" do exactly?.</strong></em>  Well i'm glad that you asked. Since there's no way to search out the Witchcrafter Fusion Spell without using <strong>Patronus </strong>(<strong>Too slow for turn-one</strong>) this deck uses instead ""<strong>Magistus Invocation</strong>"" that can be searched out with ""<strong>Rilliona, the magistus of verre</strong>"" (<strong>Since her effects procs also when special summoned you can use ""Summoner Monk"" to search her out</strong>).  With this alone it makes the deck a lot more consistent and less dependant of Verte, but there's more!.  You may combo this with <strong>""Magicalized Fusion""</strong> to have both Aiwess and Vice-Master on the field. ""<strong>Magician Souls</strong>"" is also a great card in the deck, you can cycle your deck with it's draw effect, prepare graveyard for Magicalized Fusion, and even link it off to ""<strong>Artemis, the magistus moon maiden"" </strong>and <strong>THEN </strong>normal/special summon Rilliona to search out Crowley and do Magistus combos. [<strong>Zoroa is there to be SS from the deck with xyz Rilliona]</strong>  The best part of this deck is that depending on your opening hand you may go with a Witchcrafter-only play or a Magistus-only play, or even better, both of them at the same time!.  I truly believe that this version of the Witchcrafter deck (<strong>While being an actual Witchcrafter deck) </strong>is the one with the highest ceiling and consistency out of all that i've tried out.

Orthros is just a good level 4 Tuner and serves as a decent Scale. Vice Typhoon is like a second Necro Slime, and can be sent straight to the GY by Copernicus, which is why I don't run something like Foolish Burial. Ragnarok is good for both the Scale effect and Monster effect. Zero Rage is the best scale in the deck, and stops you from taking damage by something like Ragnarok, Gilgamesh, or your Dark Contracts. </span>  <span>Extra Deck - 2 Ghengis, to either go into High King Caesar or to use for Synchro material, and also to chain summons from the GY. Oracle can help heal lost LP and can be used as Synchro material with Lamia to make Siegfried. Beowulf is just a good card in general, having a field-wide spell/trap wipe and gives your monsters piercing. Caesar Ragnarok can be replaced by Purple Armageddon, but both work, I just find Caesar Ragnaroks steal/equip effect more useful than destruction/burn. Both work well. Alexander is kinda just an extender and Synchro fodder. Siegfried is one of your best negates, being a quick-effect targeting negate. High King Ghengis is also a spell/trap negate. Baby Caesar can search for any Contract after leaving the field, and you can summon King Tell using Baby Caesar. Burn your opponent then use King Tell as Link fodder for Gilgamesh, then use King Tells effect. High King Caesar is probably the best negate in the deck, being a summon negate + destruction, even if it's in the hand. It's not once per turn, and is a quick effect. Basically, it's 2 mini Solemn Strikes that don't require LP to pay. Kali Yuga is the last thing you want to go into, as it shuts down everything else for the turn. Hes also got a spell/trap board wipe, and can also search any Dark Contract from the GY. Gilgamesh is the last card, and he carries a lot of the plays. Use him to get D/D's in the grave such as King Tell, use him to get the Pend scales you want, use him as fusion fodder, he just makes everything possible. </span>  <span>I'm using this in Master Duel, but this works in the TCG too I'm pretty sure. In fact it'd probably be better because of cards like Gryphon and Deus Machinex.</span>"

This archetype's playstyle revolves around summoning Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. Now that this deck's name has been explained, onto the strategy!  &nbsp;  This Nibiru-proof deck actually has a Live Twin and Frog engine, and around 15 hand traps. So while you CAN go second, your strategy should be to go first and set up as many disruptions/negates as you can. Funny thing about Toadally Awesome, though.

The weakest main deck cards of IDS are in my opinion the shaddoll maindeck monsters, so why not cut them out and replace them with something better, that enables a plethora of new powerful fusion monsters. Also as far as I know, verte ignores branded fusion's locking effect, allowing you to use verte to send branded fusion and use its fusion effect even though you link summoned.  ""Why not 3 aluber?"" -me poor  ""Why no DPE?"" -see above and I think Fusion Destiny might get banned soon so I don't want to invest in it.  ""Why no pots or draw cards?"" -because I am a bad deck builder and don't fear god.  A card I am considering siding (or even possibly playing main deck) is incredible ecclesia, I feel going second this card could be great and it would be okay going first but it doesn't seem high-impact enough to justify its price tag, at least for branded stuff. In Swordsoul its probably justified.  You can do the usual IDS stuff to set up mechaba with schism to summon winda on your opponent's turn, as a matter of fact Winda is still going to be your wincon and as long as winda and the cards that enable her are legal, she will always be the wincon of this deck, despite being so hated. The difference is we have a better shaddoll fusion: branded fusion. Ghost Ogre, Effect Veiler, Nibiru, and all of our Dogmatika monsters are lights, which are fuel for Albion the Branded dragon, which can be used to go into Mirrorjade, Mechaba, Augoeides, probably more; I haven't sat down to do a lot of testing yet. With so many lights we can also run Despian Quaeritis as an extra deck option, but our space is tight so I didn't include it here. I chose to run Almiraj + Secure Guardna over just Artemis to ensure we have fodder for Maximus if we can get access to him. If we can get Maximus access, we have Winda access, and Winda is the wincon."
