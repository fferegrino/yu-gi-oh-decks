You want to prioritize turbo'ing Abyss Dweller ASAP because Dweller is so powerful. The hand traps should give you an edge to block most decks' extension. Pyro Phoenix is now viable since Dingirsu isn't EVERYWHERE in the meta. If you do happen to come across Orcust, dont make Pyro. Linguriboh is your answer to Evenly Matched however it does turn on Super Poly, so use it with caution. Sanctum engine breaks all the combo decks and will force them to scoop since you can set up so much, go +3 or more and just shut them down."

I know many people may disagree, but the deck still has powerful capabilities. All it needs is a bit of tweaking and","To be honest - I don't know why that many people hated Striker. Sure its drawing to its second year of being meta since its release, and yes, it was prevalent even as an engine in many decks. But the deck basically did nothing wrong! Okay - it did make Striker Orcust take up all 8 spots in a YCS top cut, and maybe it was the reason people began siding specific cards against the deck but...that doesn't mean they did something wrong right? Sky Striker is and, will be, one of Yugioh's best engines. Not only was the deck an absolute powerhouse by itself - it fueled the ever-popular Striker Orcust in its prime time not too long ago. But can it uphold it's reputation even after its key card was banned? Yes. That's why I'd like to present; Pure Sky Striker (post January 2020 banlist).  When a deck's playstyle is ruined - people often revert to how they originally played, as that is the most optimal way now that something is gone. That's why I, and a lot of others, have decided to run Darkest Diabolos. For those of you unaware to its purpose - Diabolos is a 3000 attack beatstick that can reoccur itself if a DARK attribute monster is tributed. Since you always use Raye to start your combos, what's better than to get more fodder along with her. This lord of the lair can easily be used as tribute for ningirsu or most likely Sieg. Think about it this way: 1 Striker Card Destroyed = Free Sieg.  Sieg can also be summoned of off the newly released, Sky Striker Ace - Roze. This card does - in concept - the same thing as Diabolos, just worded differently. If you summon a Sky Striker monster - you get to summon out Roze. It's that simple. The final and by far biggest change, is the addition of Pot of MBT....oh sorry, Pot of Extravagance. Engage (rest in peace) was our only way of searching and drawing. Now that it's gone: people have been trying to find alternative ways to continue plussing. Luckily for us - we can now max out on each of our link monsters, meaning there is no fear in banishing a copy. Along with that, another pot has been thrown in the mix. To balance out our extra deck - Pot of Avarice prevents us from burning out resources too quickly. Yes you have to draw it - but when you do the odds will shift drastically in your favour.  Overall: I'd give this deck a 8.1/10. It definitely took a hit from the banlist - but that doesn't stop it from being viable. Do I think it is dead? No. I myself even believe that Konami will release support for the deck. Although, probably not any time soon. The build itself is solid, and I don't feel like there's much to change about it. The only reason this analysis was so short is that Striker has cookie-cutter combos. It has been doing the same thing for the past 2 years and many people are getting tired of it. But I feel that the deck isn't dead just yet - and neither is any other..."

I've removed the two Tsuchinokos for three Apprentice Illusionist Magicians, so it is possible to choose what to discard, granting more secure combo extensions. The A.I.M. alongside D-Hero Malicious, also is a level 6 monster, enabling Krebons to synchro with it fot the newly added Borreload-Savage Dragon.  The one-of Mathematician also is a newcomer to this deck. I was opting for two or three, but I wanted to keep in both, Destrudo and Gizmek Orochi as combo extenders, rather than having more combo starters, as in my opinion, Orcust has enough of them, even Orcustrated Return can be a combo starter under the right circumstances, which are plentiful in this deck.  Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion also can act as a potential combo starter, milling three cards from the top of your deck, each time that a card is added from your deck to your graveyard, and letting you move a card of your choice from your Deck to your Graveyard every turn, without any restrictions on what that card can be.  Barricadeborg Blocker also lets you discard any card each turn, even when you do not have any Continuous- or FIeldspell in your graveyard, as the discard is a cost. The add from graveyard to hand effect will simply not resolve then. As Barricadeborg Blocker also is a Dark Machine Monster, you can summon him in a turn in which you have used Orcust-Crescendo.  Elsewhise, the usual Orcust strategies will work as always."

Consistent Borrelend + Savage + ","I was building dragon link with Orcust before, but since harp was banned, extending to Orcust is now very difficult. So I come with another gameplan, because Verte is like a new Knightmare Mermaid, means you can have it as plan B or C if your combo fails. Super consistent setup with many different extenders (so it doesnt matter if it hard once per turn since we're running many different ones). Combo is like regular dragon link, with little modification, like if we're playing in MR4, we need to pay attention for link marker for Dragun and Savage (summoning Savage first, then summoning link monster in another extra zone so we can open up for Verte then Dragun). Borrelend is also can target Silverrokket to snipe opponent Super Poly target like Starving Venom, Dragostapelia, @Ignister Golem, or even their primary extra deck monster.  You may ask, why <a data-name=""Chamber Dragonmaid"">Chamber Dragonmaid</a>? The answer is it's your second <a data-name=""Seyfert"">Seyfert</a>, making us playing 6 starters. Chamber searches Hospitality on summon (both normal or ss, so can work with Gateway Dragon, even better than normal summoning Seyfert and tributing itself), link off Chamber for Striker Dragon, use Hospitality ss Chamber from GY, and now you have free link 2 (Romulus or Beat Cop if locked into dark because Rokket Synchron or Tracer). Basic end board is to have Borrelend + Savage and/or Dragun depends on our hands. We play minimal Rokket monsters because the recovery aspect (follow up play) is relying on Dragun as we can easily summon the second one using Magicalized Fusion (searchable from Verte, a generic link 2) and Borrelend is a disruption by itself, no need to target a Rokket monster to disrupt.  Dragon's Mirror used to summon Borreload Furious as it can act as disruption or extender and even reviving our godly link 5 Borrelend (cant activate its effect, but we still have the passives like protection and atking all monsters each). I was playing Destrudo but changed it to Tempest, Dragon Ruler beacuse Verte needs a 2k LP therefore making you left with 2k LP after using both, even non OTK deck can kill you easily (can play Galactic Spiral Dragon too).  Pros: Ultra consistent board with backup plan if playing through handtraps, multiple negations, hard hitters with protection, Dragun can pop 2 non targeting destruction, can follow up with great play even after they break our board.  Cons: Still has no prevention to Kaijus, Sphere Mode, Lava Golem, Santa Claws etc. Sometimes opponent has multiple Super Poly target in their extra deck."

Just try getting Mystic Mine on the field as soon as possible while you use COTOM to slowly burn your opponent. You can also go for Final Countdown.  Gravekeeper's Servant + Macro Cosmos or DF to avoid enemy monsters from attacking if you don't have the field spell yet.  Messenger of Peace for a super bad luck situation in which you didn't get either the field spell or the GS.  I've tried myself this deck with over 95% winrate against meta and non meta.

This is a pure <strong>Mekk-Knight </strong>deck with some situation-depending monsters in the Extra Deck.  I highly recommend to take a few minutes to read this if you're new to Mekk-Knights.  <strong>Gameplay:</strong>  This deck is strongly depending on how many cards are on the opponent's side of the field. The basic Gameplay is to special summon all monsters, except for Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu and Ash-Blossom (if needed). You have the best chances to win if your opponent starts the first turn of the duel.  As you can see I'm a big fan of control cards such like: <strong>Kaiju</strong>'s and <strong>Mind Control</strong>. Of course you can extend the deck to your play style, but I think adding more cards that will counter your opponent will also brick yourself. The Sidedeck includes what's playable and reliable. I wouldn't really recommend to go over 40 (max. 45) cards.  <strong>Combos:</strong>  First of all: place any of your Spell, Traps face-down in columns your opponent also occupied one place so you can start special summoning. Watch out what to place, could happen that your opponent activates a <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em> or <em>Twin Twister </em>and that could interrupt your combo because your spells are also important.  <strong>Keep in mind: </strong>The Quick-Spell <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong><em>can't be activated the turn you set</em> it and is also your only summoning restriction card! I would recommend to avoid playing it early in your turn and keep it as last resort, either as protection wall for the opponent's round or the last summon to get your Link monster out.  The basic starter includes getting a <strong>Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall </strong>out. It's basically your deck search and hand extender. If you can play him in your turn, activate his effect and banish himself, so you can keep him for your next round and just search for whatever you need, I would also recommend to search <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky </strong>because he's your second ""extender monster"" in the Main Deck.  If you don't have him in the hand try getting out an <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky </strong>or <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</strong>.  <strong>Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse </strong>is basically a free special summon and in mid-game your protection and negation (more on this later), beside to <strong>Purple Nightfall </strong>(protection). Summon him and move him into another Main Monster Zone (MMZ) you can't special summon right now into it (e.g. no cards in the column) to make space for another special summon from your hand.  If summoning <strong>Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</strong> from your hand, by it's own effect, you should have in mind a priority order on what to search (effect), depending on your available (in hand and on the field) cards in that moment and the quantity of searchable cards . A few examples on priority search, orderer from 1-3 cards searchable: <ul>  	<li><strong>Blue Sky</strong> is the only monster you have available right now? <strong>Purple Nightfall, Indigo Eclipse, Orcust Girsu.</strong></li>  	<li>Added <strong>Blue Sky</strong>, due to <strong>Purple Nightfall</strong>'s effect? <strong>Indigo Eclipse, Orcust Girsu, </strong>other Mekk-Knight depending on Board constellation.</li>  	<li>Missing only a normal summon? <strong>Orcust Girsu, Purple</strong> <strong>Nightfall</strong> ,<strong> Indigo Eclipse </strong>(Purple and Indigo are for your next turn).</li> </ul> <em>Mekk-Knight Red Moon, Mekk-Knight Yellow Star, Mekk-Knight Green Horizon and Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset </em>are situation depending to activate their effects. Don't be scared to use Red Moon's and Yellow Star's effects, just keep in mind you can only return 2 of your banished cards, so again I would recommend a priority order what to banish to: If you are early in the game and don't have a big quantity on what to banish go with this priority order (first is less in value): <em>Orange Sunset, Green Horizon, Red Moon, Blue Sky, Yellow Star,</em> <em>Orcust Girsu, Purple Nightfall, Indigo Eclipse. </em>  After playing for a while you'll either understand the whole priority listing or do one on your own experience/game style.  <strong>Lib the World</strong> <strong>Keymaster </strong>should be if possible your first link summon. Keep in mind you can only summon her if a <strong>World Legacy</strong> card is in your GY. I recommend to summon her after summoning <strong>Orcust Girsu</strong> (send 1 <strong>World Legacy - ""World Crown""</strong> from your deck to the GY). Depending on your opportunities either set a negation Spell/Trap ( <strong>World Legacy Key, World Legacy Whispers, World Legacy's Secret</strong> ) or a Spell that allows you to special summon ( <strong>World Legacy's Memory, World Legacy Succession</strong> ).  Your goal should always be to end your turn with at least 1 negation ( I recommend <strong>World Legacy's Secret </strong>because it's the monster negation and you can special summon <strong>Indigo Eclipse</strong> from your GY after wasting him for a Link summon ), 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star </strong>and an banished <strong>Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall</strong>. Everything that exceeds this is even better. If you succesfully reached this constellation on your side of the board you're already good to go, just repeat the process until you have 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight Avramax</strong>, 1 <strong>Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star </strong>and in every other column a Mekk-Knight and all 3 of your negation-spell/traps out.  <strong>Good to know:</strong>  Every <em>Mekk-Knight</em> can only be summoned once per Turn from the hand (hard OpT).  If using <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong>and you haven't already played a <strong>Purple Nightfall</strong>, special summon him and use his effect on himself (decreases the chance to end up with 2 copies of him in your hand and only be able to special summon 1).  <strong>World Legacy's Memory </strong>restricts you from summoning anything else then Mekk-Knights after activating it!  <strong>Indigo Eclipse</strong>'s effect is a <em>Quick Effect </em>/ <em>Spell Speed 2</em>. You can react to every card except for restrictions and Counter Traps to move one of your Mekk-Knights into another Column to prevent the resolve of an effect. Example: You posses <em>World Legacy Whisper </em>(Spell negation) and <em>Indigo Eclipse in the MMZ next to your GY (first from right from your POV). Your Opponent activates Trade-In in the mid column. You could chain Indigo Eclipse's effect to target itself and move it into the mid column. The effect of Trade-In won't resolve.</em>  <strong>World Legacy Succession </strong>is your second <em>Monster Reborn.</em> Keep in mind that World Legacy's Secret only allows you to special summon a Lv5 or higher monster from your GY. So beside Monster Reborn, <em>World Legacy Succession </em>is your only way to special summon a Link/XYZ monster from your GY.  Link summoning  <strong>Knightmare Unicorn </strong>with <strong>Lib the World Keymaster</strong> and activating <em>Knightmare Unicorn</em>'s effect if summoned allows you to chain Lib's effect. In summary you can shuffle 2 cards from the field into the deck. Pay attention on your chain activation, because if your opponent can negate one of the effect's that resolved it shouldn't be Lib's (doesn't target).  <strong>Kaiju</strong>'s supposed to get rid of annoying monsters <strong>and </strong>change the board constellation! If you still have a Mekk-Knight in your hand you could possibly summon but there isn't any MMZ with 2 occupied card slots in the same column, special summon the Kaiju to your opponent's side of the field to your advantage."

A synchro based deck with focus on DARK Dragon Synchro monster mainly due to Crimson Resonator's effect. A really fun deck to play but not really meta worthy. It easily loses to hand traps which is why I am using 3 Called by the Grave's in the deck. Super Polymerization is also really nasty against the deck since my first turn usually ends with Super Nova and Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss on my field. Two DARK targets for Starving Venom. I am using Back to the Front to try and survive it but there is no countering it. I lost several times just to that one card. the Edge Imp engine is there because they are searchable with Command Resonator and because they can generate some much needed card advantage.

However, milling improves the speed of the Deck and many ""Lightsworn"" cards benefit from having many ""Lightsworn"" monsters in the Graveyard. A primary focus of this Deck is to quickly summon ""judgement dragon"", which may be Special Summoned while there are 4 or more different ""Lightsworn"" monsters in the Graveyard. ""Judgment Dragon"" can quickly clear the field and attack directly. This strategy is most useful when running a small Deck, and has the potential to turn the tables in your favor before your opponent can get too much of a foothold."

First use the hidden city for subterror guru, then use pre-prep for tarotrei and prediction ritual, activate prediction ritual sending the high level monster to summon tarotrei. use world legacy monstrocity to summon pot of the forbidden and deus-x-krawler from deck,  next because they both get destroyed anyways during the end phase link them away for a subterror behemoth fiendess. use fiendess effect to send a flip from the deck to the GY mostly umastryx then set either a high level flip monster you may have drawn in the zone she points to or set guru by her effect. Next use the hidden city to flip Guru face up, searching a subterror fiendess. Subterror behemoth fiendess other effect activates and you get to add a flip from GY or deck to hand, search ultramafaus or umastryx. Now you can normal summon subterror fiendess, activate her effect setting the Guru to special summon umastryx from GY in face up def position.  Now go to end phase and tarotrei activates her effect to set a flip from the gy or the hand, set Deus-x-krawler from the GY and during the oponents standby phase use tarotrei to flip Deus-X-krawler to face up atack mode, this makes deus-x live and your oponent can no longer use monster effects on their side of the field.  This is the absolute best opening you can hope for, you have a permanent skill drain from deus-x for your oponent, you have the omni negate from subterror fiendess in case they have spell/trap removal such as lightning storm or evenly matched and battle protection from the hidden city and your now set umastryx that banishes a monster when flipped by hidden city.

If too much Shaddolls are x3 or even x2 the deck would brick.  Beast is x2 because you don't want it in the hand when you start the duel since is a level 5, so is better having it in the deck and special summon it from there or send it to the GY. Still is a very good card since is a +1 and when flipped can send and activate another Shaddoll, but usually other plays are preferred.  Ariel, Falco, Dragon, and Hedgehog are all more situational and you special summon, set or send them to the GY depending on what you need the most at the moment. For this reason every single one of them is fine with x1 copy.  Mathematician is a great card, basically is another Squamata when normal summoned, a +1 when destroyed in battle and a fusion material for El Shaddoll Shekinaga.  As for the Performages, Damage Juggler and Trick Clown are precious fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct. Plus Trick Clown can special a Performage (even itself) when sent to the GY, while Damage Juggler allow you to add a Trick Clown from the deck to the hand.  Shaddoll Fusion, El Shaddoll Fusion and Super Polymerization are the cards you need the most together with the monsters of course, and you can recover the first and the second with Hedgehog, Core and El Shaddoll monsters when sent to the GY.  Foolish burial is another Squamata / Mathematician but is a spell, so you can use it with them (before or after) to activate more Shaddolls and speed up your plays (same for Resh Shaddoll Incarnation by banishing it from the GY, speed up your plays by flipping monsters you have set this turn, beside it's another Monster Reborn when used from the field).  Allure of darkness and Upstart goblin speed up your game too, but note than Allure is not always beneficial. As for Pot of avarice is a fantastic card since you will have a very big GY and fill it quickly, so you can fusion summon again and again.  Mind control (like Monster reborn and the traps) extends your plays by giving you more material for link summon and fusion summon, especially when you need su summon Cross-Sheep, since link summoning is not an effect and Shaddolls secondary effects would not activate, so you can use monsters you already activated in your GY or the opponent's monsters.  As for the Extra deck, El Shaddoll Construct is your main beater along with Borrelsword (but this one is more used to finish to opponent when you're certain you can do it), Winda (especially her), Shekinaga, Grysta, Anoyatyllis and Apkallone are your main control tools. Remember to summon Winda as last monster or you will lock yourself with her effect.  Violet chimera, Starving venom fusion dragon and Grysta (except if you add Ash blossom or Salamangreat Almiraj) are all Super poly targets.  Cross-Sheep is maybe the best extender you have in the whole deck (every time you summon a fusion in a linked zone you resurrect a material from the GY), Gravity controller is mainly used in combo with El Shaddoll Construct, Ariel and and Resh Shaddoll Incarnation to special summon again Construct (fusion), Shaddoll Construct (link) is another good extender, a El Shaddoll Construct material and another fusion spell in case you don't draw one (another one very good link who can fusion summon is Predaplant Verte Anaconda, upcoming in Duel Overload, so look into it in March).  Of course the Invoked Shaddoll version is more powerful, but some Invoked cards are probably being banned in few months, since this combination works too much well, so I preferred going with a pure build since I don't attend the biggest events at the moment but I'm just going at locals."

Don't summon until you used up your Gigantes and/or Seekers.  <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> x2: Played more for what it is, rather then what it does. Easy to summon level 4 that will instantly get you to your important Synchros. Can be a decent beater in a pinch. Banish Seeker or Glow-up bulb to SS it if you can.  <a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a> x2:  Good discard fodder and your main way to Naturia Beast, as it SS itself afterwards as long as you have at least one monster out.  <a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> x2: Decent NS if you have one of the level 4 Rocks in hand, as it lets you discard them and bring another one to the field for more plays.  <a data-name=""Glow-up bulb"">Glow-up bulb</a>: Its glow-up bulb, you play it so that you can access Naturia beast or Needlefiber easier. Run one because you can only use it's effect once per duel.  <a data-name=""Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring"">Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring</a> x2: Hand trap staple, use it to prevent your opponent from getting a big field out.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Analyzer"">Adamatia Analyzer</a> x3: Your best first turn option. She's level 4, so if you excavate any of the Rocks you have an instant Dragite. Her SS condition is really only useful if you go second, but it has saved me on more than one occasion.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Researcher"">Adamatia Researcher</a> x3: The best of the level 2 tuners, her SS condition is the easiest to fulfill, only needing a rock monster on field. She normally leads to a level 6 synchro or crystal wing if one of them is already on the field.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Seeker"">Adamatia Seeker</a> x3: Easily the worst of the 3 turners, requiring an Adamatia monster to SS itself. Other than that it's the same as Researcher.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Crysta - Leonite"">Adamatia Crysta - Leonite</a> and <a data-name=""Adamatia crysta - Raptite"">Adamatia crysta - Raptite</a> x2: Both of these function the same, use their SS effects to bring back another level 4 rock or a tuner for recycling. After their respective Synchros hits the graveyard, activate its graveyard effect to recycle them and keep the cycle going.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Crysta - Dragite"">Adamatia Crysta - Dragite</a> x3: Best of the non tuner rocks. Lets you draw more cards; really useful if you put something on the top of your deck you want. Even gets the draw off of Sign.  <strong>Spells</strong>  <a data-name=""Called by the grave"">Called by the grave</a> x2: Anti-hand trap for the most part, you can also use it to stop a floating effect or screw over cards that copy names.  <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> x2: Better MST, and it sets up your Graveyard.  <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: Used to search the field-spell, kinda obvious though. Run at 2 if it ever gets unlimited.  <a data-name=""Adamatia sign"">Adamatia sign </a>x3: Archetypal monster reborn, use it to recycle your tuners to bring out more synchros, make sure to put one of the non tuners on the top of your deck so you can bring them out with Raptite or add them to your hand with Leonite.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Laputite"">Adamatia Laputite</a> x2: Not a super important card, but one that makes your plays way more consistent. Only bring one card you want to bring out to the top of your deck and put ones you don't want to see with it so that they'll be at the bottom of the deck after the one you actually wanted is used up. Combos really well with Dragite if you still have adamatia monsters in your deck, letting you bounce 5 cards back.  <strong>Traps</strong>  <a data-name=""Adamatia Relieve"">Adamatia Relieve</a> x2: Pretty useful, lets you destroy at least 2 of your opponents monsters. I only tend to use it if I have extra non tuner rocks on the field.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Resonance"">Adamatia Resonance</a> x2: The worst Adamatia card, run by preference but I like it. Especially if my opponents have annoying monster effects or handtraps.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <a data-name=""Crystal wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal wing Synchro Dragon</a>: Your main boss monster you go into after you use the level 6's effects. Negates everything and beats even harder.  <a data-name=""T.G. Hyper Librarian"">T.G. Hyper Librarian</a>: Nice level 5 to go into, you wanna try and summon this guy before anyone else if you can. Free cards man.  <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a>: Really easy to summon, negates problematic spells and sets up your graveyard.  <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a>: Mostly used as a target for Needlefiber's banish effect. Nice body, though not really useful for the Synchros that are in here. Run if you want.  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Dragite"">Adamatia Rise - Dragite</a> x2: The best of the 3 synchro rocks, lets you bounce back cards without targeting. Negates spell and traps as well if you have its Rock form in the graveyard  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Raptite"">Adamatia Rise - Raptite</a> x2: The deck's best play maker, you want to go into this synchro first as it can SS any rock monster it excavates. Ideal targets are Analyzer (for dragite), or one of the level 2 tuners (to go into Crystal wing)  <a data-name=""Adamatia Rise - Leonite"">Adamatia Rise - Leonite</a> x2: The worst of the rock synchros, as it only lets you add cards to your hand instead of SS them.

Combos for a board state with Winda, Apollousa, and either Invoked Caliga or Mechaba, or just plays it fair with fusion spells.  3 Aleister, 3 Invocation, 3 Meltdown. The Invoked engine helps increase consistency and find us fusion spells, and Invocation is also notable for not being once per turn on the play effect. This engine is both essential to the combo, and really good in the deck.  We need light monsters for Construct, so I'm on a Performage package of 3 Damage Juggler searching 1 Trick Clown. Damage Jugglers are a key piece of the deck's Appolousa Combo, which is why the 3 - 1 ratio.  For Shaddolls I have 1 Ariel, a combo piece, 2 Wendi, 3 Squamata, 2 Hedgehog, 2 Beast, 1 Dragon, and a Falco. Wendi is essential to the combo, and Squamata are essentially extra copies for those purposes. 2 Beast and 2 Hedgehog were to reduce the number of games you draw one and need the card draw. Falco still makes the cut as a free extender, (and a much poorer back-up Ariel/Wendi for the combo.)  3 Allure of Darkness give us extra card filtration, useful when we see too many copies of Aleister.  In addition to the Invocations, I run 3 Super-Poly, and 3 of each Shaddoll Fusion. Pretty self explanatory, these are the meat of your deck. Being able to run Super Poly maindeck is excellent, and I made room in the extra deck for a small package (including pieces which are easy to make using our own board.) Lastly, 1 Foolish Burial, to trigger any Shaddoll effect in the deck.  2 Resh Shaddoll Incarnation are run, almost exclusively for the combo, though I suppose being a Call of the Haunted is fine.  Made space in the Extra deck for a second Winda.  Cut the third Construct for Invoked Elysium.

To begin, the deck is cheap, and I always liked <em>Paleozoic</em>.  In 3 words I can describe the best qualities of the deck: <strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>versatility</strong> and <strong>synergy</strong>.  There is no main combo, but there is a lot of ways to achieve the stronger strategy which is controlling the board. <em>Paleozoic</em> is a Trap based archetype, so that means that if we would go second we would be in a more difficult spot. No exactly thanks to the <em>Volcanic</em> cards and the <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em>. What differs this variant of <em>Paleozoic</em> deck with the already very known <em>Frog Paleozoic</em>, is that this deck takes the most advantage of the <em>Paleozoic Opabinia</em> and the <em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em>.  You will be summoning a lot <em>Paleozoic Opabinia</em>, and then <em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em>. (Only summon <em>Toadally Awesome</em> if you really have no option).  Lets proceed to the explanation of the cards I choose.  Firstly, you see a lot of trios, that is because of one of the strongest cards in the deck which is <em>Trap Trick</em>. We want to be able to search with this card whatever we want in this deck.  Secondly, <em>Paleozoic Opabinia </em>is a powerful monster that ables to proceed with the strategy that must suits us in the game state. It search the pieces needed to control the board. A good thing about <em>Paleozoic</em> while they are Monster Cards is that they are not affected by other Monster effects. Which means, Monster Hand Traps won't do much for the opponent (bad draws for your opponent if he draws of of those).  SPELL/TRAP CONTROL <ul>  	<li><em> Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Olenoides</em></li>  	<li><em>Heavy Storm Duster</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Anomalocaris</em></li> </ul> <em>Mystic Mine</em> is a powerful card. Not only we have cards to get rid of that card your opponent might have, as we also have one of our own! Well... partially. But the best is that it will mostly all the time affect the opponent. I am talking about <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em>. Since we are all the time setting Traps, the first effect is most likely not going to affect us. If the opponent is also playing with a Trap based deck, it can be a bad card (depending if you draw a lot of back row removal). Your opponent is going to try to set cards in order to be able to attack and activate their Monster effects that are on the field. And that is why we run a lot a Spell/Trap destruction, so that the opponent won't be able to make his strategies. We might even get rid of powerful Spells that he sets attempting to be able to continue. But as soon as he sets something we can shout ""NOT SO FAST!"" and we activate something to get rid of it.  VOLCANIC STRATEGY <ul>  	<li><em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em></li>  	<li><em>Volcanic Scattershot</em></li>  	<li><em>Volcanic Shell</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Marrella</em></li>  	<li><em>Jar of Avarice</em></li> </ul> What do you think of the idea of having a (Quick Effect) <em>Raigeki</em>? Pretty enticing right? <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em> together with <em>Volcanic Scattershot</em> can give us that. And thanks to <em>Paleozoic Marrella</em> we can easily achieve that intention. But once we used it, we can no longer use it again, unless we recycle every thing with <em>Jar of Avarice</em> (<em>Jar of Avarice</em> can also target another <em>Jar of Avarice</em> that you might have in your GY, so it can make an infinite loop). It is possible to have the luck to counter <em>Called By the Grave</em> with <em>Jar of Avarice</em> in the moment you try to activate your <em>Volcanic Scattershot</em>'s effect. <em>Volcanic Shell</em> gives more value to the activation of both effects of <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload</em>.  Helpers: <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Dinomischus</em></li>  	<li><em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <em>Volcanic Shell </em>is a weak monster, but with a cool effect. Not only he is a Level 1 Monster that can turn into <em>Linkuriboh</em>, which can protect an opponent's attack against your also weak 1200 ATK <em>Paleozoic</em> Monsters, but it also makes <em>Paleozoic Dinomischus</em> have less costing impact on you. <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em> is mostly used to bring back <em>Blaze Accelerator Reload </em>or one of your possible banished <em>Volcanic Scattershot.</em> It is important to mention that <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia </em>can also be used in your opponent banished cards (it can be used against opponent's Monsters that comes back to the field from the banished zone, like <em>Time Thief Rodeor</em>).  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><em>The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace</em></li> </ul> Is a very spicy card that can be used for many purposes in many occasions (the only bad thing about this card is that you cannot activate it against Xyz and Link Monsters, or even activate it at all if there isn't any valid targeted monster on the field): <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>it is a Normal Trap Card, which means it can be searched by <em>Trap Trick</em>;</li>  	<li>summon itself as a Level 2 Monster (which can be used for any Xyz Summon, considering it as a very useful Trap Card Material);</li>  	<li>it can make your other Monsters that are Level 1 into a Level 2, so it can be used for our Rank 2 Xyz Monsters;</li>  	<li>change an opponent's Monster's Level to 2 (in order to prevent an Xyz Summon of a certain Rank);</li>  	<li>prevent your opponent to attack your life points directly with their attacking Monsters (since when it is summoned, it cannot be destroyed by battle);</li>  	<li>stopping an opponent attack against one of your monsters that you want to keep (by decreasing his ATK);</li>  	<li>reduce an opponent's Monster ATK, so that you can defeat it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <em>Paleozoic Canadia</em> -&gt; is just like a <em>Book of Moon</em>. I think I don't need to explain much about that.  <em>Foolish Burial</em> -&gt; it is mostly another copy of <em>Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician</em> since it can set itself when you set a card, but it can also be used to send <em>Volcanic Shell</em>.  <em>Imperial Order</em> -&gt; a very strong floodgate that not many decks can deal with it.  The last card in the deck is <em>Pot of Extravagance,</em> the most expensive card in the deck. We are mostly going for the same Extra Deck Monsters, which are the <em>Paleozoic</em>, so we can afford to play this card. It can either be increased to 3 copies in the deck (so you can see it more often) or even decreased to 0/1. If you decide to not use it at all, you will probably spend the same amount of money to fill your Extra Deck with other Monsters, but hey, if you want to have a richer Extra Deck full of choices, then go for it. You can always use <em>Paleozoic Leanchoilia</em> to bring back one of your Extra Deck Monsters, but in this last case, you would still have the work to have the need to put it back in the Extra Deck."

In a Highlander Format. It's either a meme or its gold,"This is a deck that started out as a meme, and remains a meme (cue the Side Deck). The deck's overall goal is to get access to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Crimson%20Nova%20the%20Dark%20Cubic%20Lord"">Crimson Nova The Dark Cubic Lord</a> and win with his strong offensive pressure. I constructed the deck with all of the Cubic cards, because Crimson Nova needs 3 with different names, except for Cubic Rebirth and Cubic Mandala because I had no use for them. The rest of the deck consisted of goodstuff cards (Torrential Tribute, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Etc.) and value engines (Heroes, Baobaboon, Dangers!) to allow the deck to have filler while you work your way towards its overall gameplan. I will say that its a super meme with Triple Vijam The Cubic Seed, but it works so I'm fine with it. It does struggle against some matchups like Blue-Eyes and Heroes, buts an all around strong deck that been able to take consistent wins over moderately strong decks."

With staple cards and hand traps that disrupt the opponent as well as cards that help swarm the field with Cyber Dragons, the deck can manage to pull off OTKs and summon powerful monsters, such as ""Constellar Pleiades"" and ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"".  <strong>MAIN DECK MONSTERS</strong>  <strong>Cyber Dragon</strong>  ""Cyber Dragon"" is essentially the ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"" of our deck, in it that the deck essentially revolves around this card to function properly. Cyber Dragon isn't a bad card in itself, though, as it only requires your opponent to control a monster to special summon itself. Of course, this wouldn't work going first since your opponent can't even summon, unless they play something like ""PSY-Framegear Gamma"" or ""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"". That is one of the reasons why this deck prefers going second, and we run three of this card to respect said notion.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Core</strong>  ""Cyber Dragon Core"", outside of ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"", is probably the best monster in the deck. Upon normal summon, Core can get you a ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your Deck, an instant +1 in hand economy. Not only that, but Core can banish itself to get you a free Cyber Dragon monster on the field while only your opponent controls a monster. Moreover, Core counts as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field or in the Graveyard (GY), but the importance of this will be explained later. Core is an instant three-of for its ability to produce advantage and to increase card economy.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Herz</strong>  Herz carries the same trait as Core, for it counts as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field or in the GY; however, Herz adds a Cyber Dragon monster from the Deck or the GY when sent to the GY, not upon normal summon. This can be very useful to get back Core from the GY to reuse, and it can get a Cyber Dragon from the deck for possible usage. When Herz is Special Summoned, it can become Level (LV) 5 and can be used to XYZ summon Rank 5 monsters. Keep in mind that you are restricted only to Special Summoning Machine monsters after this affect, so be aware of its restriction when using this effect. Regardless, we run three of Herz to gain advantage and to make Rank 5 plays much easier.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Nachster</strong>  Another monster that makes Cyber Dragon much more than ""I can Special Summon myself to the field and that's about it"" has to be Nachster. When Normal/Special Summoned, Nachster can ""Monster Reborn"" a Machine monster with 2100 ATK or DEF from your GY. Obviously, this gets Cyber Dragon out of the GY and onto the field, but this can also be used to Special Summon other Machine monsters from the GY, such as ""Dingirisu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"" if you are playing the Orcust variant. Not just this, but Nachster can be summoned this way by simply pitching another monster from your hand to the GY. We run this card at three to get as much field presence as we can.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Vier</strong>  Our last main deck monster that is a Cyber Dragon is Vier. This card is mainly here to serve as an extender, for it can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY when you summon a Cyber Dragon monster. It also boosts 500 ATK/DEF to Cyber Dragon monsters, but this effect is kind of useless outside of that one time where your ""Cyber Dragon"" can FINALLY attack over a monster that was 500 ATK/DEF higher than your monster. This is only run at one because it does not give you any card advantage, outside from being a +1 in field advantage.  <strong>Galaxy Soldier</strong>  Now we get into one of our non-Cyber Dragon monsters of the deck. ""Galaxy Soldier"", while not being a Cyber Dragon monster, is a LV 5 LIGHT Machine monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand by discarding another LIGHT Monster. While not as easy to summon as Nachster, Soldier does add itself to its hand upon summon, and the Special Summon effect is NOT a hard once per turn. Sadly, it does not have 2100 ATK or DEF, so it can't be summoned by Nachster. Still, we run this at three to make XYZ plays much easier.  <strong>PSY-framegear Gamma/PSY-Frame Driver</strong>  Remember how I mentioned how Gamma can Special Summon itself on your opponent's turn? Yeah, we run three of those in this deck. Because Cyber Dragons want to go first, Gamma fits in the deck perfectly, for it can negate a monster effect as long as you control no monsters. This can be very useful if your opponent uses up a lot of resources to summon a monster, such as ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and ""Dark Templar @Ignister"" (unless they chainblock you, but for the sake of an example I went with Templar). Moreover, ""Galaxy Soldier"" can pitch Gamma and Driver to summon itself, so the PSY-Frame monsters can be useful even if they don't negate a monster effect. Because of these benefits, we run a playset of Gamma and one Driver to disrupt our opponent on their first turn.  <strong>MAIN DECK SPELLS</strong>  <strong>Cyber Emergency</strong>  Our first ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap we'll go over for this decklist is Emergency, an important searcher for the deck. As stated before, ""Cyber Dragon Core"" can search any ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from the deck, and usually, you go for this card (if you don't have it in your hand). All it does is search a Cyber Dragon monster (or a LIGHT Machine that can't be Normal Summon/Set) , but its ""Reinforcement of the Army""-esque effect is very useful since we only run 13 Main Deck Cyber Dragon monsters. Obviously, your opponent would want to negate such a powerful effect, but luckily, if it gets negated and sent to the GY, you can discard a card to get it back into your hand. Such a card deserves to be a playset in this deck.  <strong>Cyber Repair Plant</strong>  Some people run two of this card. Some run one. Some even run three! But I decided that Repair Plant is better off at 2. While it does search a LIGHT Machine monster from the Deck and/or return a Cyber Dragon monster from the GY to the Deck, a Cyber Dragon monster needs to be in the GY to activate the effect(s). Luckily, if you have three or more Cyber Dragons in the GY, you can activate both effects! Usually, you opt for the search effect, but returning a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the Deck is especially useful for the card that comes after these two other ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap cards.  <strong>Cyber Revsystem</strong>  Revsystem is basically Nachster reincarnated as a Spell/Trap, but a little more expansive. It is not restricted to Machine monsters with 2100 ATK and DEF, and it can Special Summon from the hand as well. Also, that monster can not be destroyed by card effects. Sadly, this card only Special Summons ""Cyber Dragon"", so be mindful when using this card. Although this card is very powerful, we only run one of this card. It gives you only field advantage, and it can be searched off of Core anyways, so putting two or three of this card would waste deck space.  <strong>Cyberload Fusion</strong>  Our only card that we can use to Fusion Summon ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" and ""Cyber Twin Dragon"" is this card. It shuffles ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters from your field and banished zone, which is useful if you have ""Cyber Dragon"" banished or Cyber Dragon monsters on the field. Only that monster can attack for the rest of the turn after you summon it, but it is a fine price to pay. We only run one because it can be searched off of Core. Also, if you want to run cards like ""Power Bond"" and ""Overload Fusion"" to help summon these Fusion Monsters, that's all fine by me.  <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>  You always want to see this card in your opening hand. Remember when I said that Core, Herz, and Nachster all count as ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field? Well, by using this card, you can Special Summon two copies of ""Cyber Dragon"" straight from your deck! Not only can you easily make ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" this way, but you gain +1 in field presence. I kind of went over why these monsters are important, but this gives another reason why they are all at three. With nine targets for ""Machine Duplication"", you can't go wrong. You run three of this for sure.  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>  Coming right at you out of Ignition Assault is our awesome, mass-removal friend, ""Lightning Storm"". Like Gamma, it is a go-second card that disrupts the opponent. But unlike monster negation, it acts like a ""Lightning Vortex"" (without the discard) or a ""Harpie's Feather Duster"", just as long as you don't have face-up cards on the field. This is a very good card to either break your opponent's board or to bait out negation, and it is a three-of to make sure our Cyber Dragons can make good plays.  <strong>MAIN DECK TRAPS</strong>  <strong>Cybernetic Overflow</strong>  Although Cyber Dragons are a go-second deck, Overflow has snuck into our last one-of ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap to talk about. Basically, Overflow (after you banish Cyber Dragon monsters with different LVs from your hand, face-up field, or GY) pops cards on your opponents field for each card banished. This card can pop up to three cards for this decklist, but it you want to run ""Proto-Cyber Dragon"" or ""Cyber Dragon Drei"", then I salute you for sacrificing consistency for board-wiping abilities. Also, the banishing effect can work with Cyberload Fusion, so that's nice.  <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>  Outside of ""Lightning Storm"" and countless other cards, ""Evenly Matched"" is arguably one of the best going second cards in terms of board wipes. At the end of your Battle Phase, you can activate this card from your hand to make your opponent banish their cards face-down until they control the same amount of cards as you do (usually one). Ignoring cards like ""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"" for simplicity, let's say your opponent has a card in their Extra Deck Zone and all cards in the Main Monster Zone, Spell &amp; Trap Zone, and Field Spell Zone. Assuming that ""Evenly Matched"" is the only card you control during activation and that your opponent can't negate said card, your opponent would be banishing ELEVEN CARDS!!! This card's power cannot be ignored, and we run this card at three to celebrate this amazing card.  <strong>Infinite Impermanence </strong>  This card, ""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"", and ""Called by the Grave"" all have one thing in common: they are side deck cards that players usually Main Deck. And who could blame them? Ash Blossom negates search cards, Called negates monsters that activate in the GY, and Impermanence negates a face-up monster on the field. However, Ash Blossom does not go well with Galaxy Soldier and the theme of the deck, and Called is a better card going first, so a playset of Impermanence makes sense for this deck, especially when it wants to go second.  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  <strong>Cyber Dragon Nova</strong>  Before we discuss our key player of the deck, we must go over the card that is needed to summon it: Nova. This XYZ monster can be summoned with two LV 5 Machine monsters, such as ""Galaxy Soldier"", ""Cyber Dragon"", and ""Cyber Dragon Herz"" if it becomes a LV 5. Just like Nachster and Revsystem, Nova can Special Summon ""Cyber Dragon"" from the GY (by detaching an XYZ material). Moreover, a ""Cyber Dragon"" can be banished from your hand or field to boost this card by 2100 ATK to run over large monsters. Usually, after you summon Nova and activate its effect, you XYZ summon Infinity by attaching Nova and its materials to it. But in case Nova gets hit with something like ""Solemn Judgment"", Nova can bring out a powerful Machine Fusion monster, such as ""Chimeratch Rampage Dragon"". Although this card is quite powerful, it is run at 2 to leave space for the Extra Deck.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong>  This is our main playmaker. After XYZ summoning this card, you now have a 2100 ATK beater than can attach an Attack Position monster on field to it as material and can negate a card or effect by detaching a material. Simple as that. Yet, this card is still very viable even in decks outside of Cyber Dragons, such as Galaxy Photon and Infinitrack. Also, this card can interact with cards such as Nachster and Repair Plant. This card, like Nova, is run at 2 to leave deck space.  <strong>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon/Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</strong>  Sadly, as we itch closer to Master Rule 5, the Chimeratechs are going to become less viable. But even with most Extra Deck monsters being able to be summoned to the Main Monster Zones, archetypes like Cyberse, Mathmech, SPYRAL, and Salamangreat may have monsters stuck in the Extra Deck zone. This is where Megafleet comes in, using it and a Cyber Dragon for a Contact Fusion. Fortress does the same, but with Machine monsters. Unless you are playing against Orcust, Infinitrack, or decks like that, Fortress will just sit in the Extra Deck. Yet, we play 2 Megafleet and 1 Fortress just in case they become viable in a match-up.  <strong>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon/Cyber Twin Dragon</strong>  These are the Fusion monsters that can be summoned off of Cyberload Fusion or Nova's effect. Rampage is the better of the two because it can pop backrow and can attack up to three times during the Battle Phase. However, if you don't want to commit to resources or if you have a monster that's a little stronger than 2100 ATK, Cyber Twin Dragon isn't a bad monster to summon either. It has 2800 ATK and can just attack twice. Both are one-ofs, but if you want to bump Rampage to two, that's fine.  <strong>Cyber Dragon Sieger</strong>  Sieger is an interesting link monster. It uses 2 Machine monsters, including ""Cyber Dragon"", for Link Material. Just using Core or Herz on the field is beneficial enough, but during the Battle Phase, similar to Nova, Sieger can increase a Machine monster with 2100 or more ATK on the field by 2100 ATK/DEF. We run this at one to rid of the low-attack monsters that might stick on the field.  <strong>Generic Extra Deck Monsters</strong>  I will now go over the rest of the monsters in short summaries. ""Constellar Pleiadas"" is a generic Rank 5 that bounces a card, ""Artifact Durendal"" is a generic Rank 5 that changes a monster effect and fixes hands, ""Qliphort Genius"" is a generic Link 2 that opens zones for Extra Deck Monsters, ""Linkuriboh"" sends Herz and Nachster to the GY, and ""Salamangreat Almaraj"" sends Core, Herz, and Nachster to the GY.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>  <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong>  Once in a while, you face an annoying banish dot deck that abuses ""Eater of Millions"" and ""Gren Maju Da Eiza"" to OTK you. Maybe you come across an Infernoid player that just can't stop banishing monsters from the GY to summon more monsters. Maybe you even an Orcust player that just doesn't stop abusing the GY. Well I say nay to all of that. Lancea is a great card to stop that rubbish, and amazingly, it is a LV 5. So if somehow you manage it to get on the field, you could be seeing some Rank 5 cheese.  <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>  Pretty much every deck in the meta abuses GY mechanics to get monsters out onto the field. Decks like @Ignister, Orcust, Invoked, HERO, Dark Magician, and Lunalight all use the GY in some sort of way to gain advantage. Well, I spit on all of them with my D.D. Crow. Easily, with this card, I can banish a card from my opponents GY to stop Special Summons, prevent cards from being set back (like ""Salamangreat Roar"" and ""Lost Wind""), and prevent your opponent from fulfilling their combos. It is just too good in today's meta that its impact can't be overlooked.  <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong>  Once upon a time, this card made no impact on the meta game. Other cards like Red Reboot and Pankratops once ruled the Side Deck. And then, the banlist came. Soon, SPYRALs rejuvenated as a competitive deck (ugh) and abused ""Magicians' Souls"" like crazy. How can one stop this? Simple. Droll &amp; Lock Bird. Stop the searching, stop the pluses, stop everything. (As long as you don't get hit will Called, this card might win you games!)  <strong>Heat Wave</strong>  We run basically all the go second cards in the Main Deck, so the side deck can have room for go first cards, like ""Heat Wave"". This card just shuts down Effect Monster summons and can leave you to OTK next turn, if you have enough resources.  <strong>Prohibition</strong>  This card is great going first. When you know that an archetypes hinges on one card to function properly, like Dark Magician or Phantasm Spiral, Prohibition can just shut down a card and make decks unplayable. Simple as that.  Please let me know if I can improve upon any thing in this deck. I would love to hear some feedback on this!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I would consider running 1 or 2 @Ignister monsters if the meta was Link heavy but currently they are hard to splash in Salad except for the ED monsters. Also, I was going to cut Rising Fire but then Gizmek Kaku happened. You could try Premature Burial and stuff that search Equip Spells aswell with it but I don't like increasing the deck size. I would play 3rd Circle if I went up to 45 though. This deck is still very good at doing a whole bunch of nothing."

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.
