LETS WIN HERO PLAYERS. ","<span>IDEA </span>  Basically dark law turbo, alot of strong decks this format can't play thru dark law. The only problem is people have ways to out dark law, but you just have to play smart and protect the dark law at all costs.  <span>GOING FIRST</span>  Getting out dark law is the most important thing, then you need to back it up with something else like a dystopia or sunrise or have the super poly ready. Sometimes it is worth going for double dark law because outing one is easy but alot of decks cannot out two, but sometimes double dark law is overkill. With sunriser you can stop someone from trying to attack over dark law by using its pop effect. Same idea with dystopia you just need his Atk to be boosted. Also plasma dark law is very strong.  <span>GOING SECOND</span>  Going second is interesting , it isn't smart to go dark law second. Going second I would try to get out a Sunriser or plasma, preferable both. Trinity is good here aswell. Just do not over kill. Alot of hero players try to make this super fun or the biggest board they can and over commit then lose their board and all their follow up. Do not over commit and play smart. Unless you are 100% sure the other player has 0 outs.  <span>HERO CORE RATIOS</span>  Alot of people are gonna hate me for this but Stratos at 3 is silly. Imagine opening up a hand with just stratos as ur only engine piece, you have no play. So we use stratos at 2 for the hero lives, he is the only a hero lives target, and then the second one is for the grind game and or for utility for its second effect with backrow. Double liquid because Its good for draws and getting dark law out. Also can get you dark law or mask change in the grind game. My destiny hero engine is alittle weird, I cut the second normal destiny hero, so that we use either mali and celestial for D fusions and do not be afraid to use plasma for a fusion destiny. Using mask change 2 bc of dark law turbo but I would run 3 but it is a hard once per turn. So i run two only. searchers are at 2 E calls and 1 rota, and a hero lives. Remember to use e call or rota to bait out ashe if you have a hero lives.  <span>EVIL HEROS</span>  I do not play them but If you commit to a going second build I can see it doing well. The only problem with the going second build is that is chost like $800+ if you run evil heros and the good going second cards like droplet and lightning storm. So if you have the money for it It could be a good build, but I still like this turbo dark law better for the current meta. If everyone likes my profile I would happily put up a going second build that I think would be nice.  <span>HANDTRAPS/DISTRUPIONS </span>  I think called by is cracked but could be replaced if you like 3 straos or a different staple. Super poly right now is so strong, that is why I run it just like the Gren maju player who topped the event recently. If your deck can easily run super poly and it helps out ur engine as well, it is stupid to not run it. Also i play ashe generically but it can be sided out with any other good hand trap. The only problem is , do not run cards that conflict with dark law, like ghost belle. Also gamma is good but if you summon it on your own turn, ex. like activate a hero lives , they chain ashe, then you chain gamma, you are now locked out of using cross crusaders effect bc you special summoned a non hero monster. So keep that in mind. That is also the case with super poly, so if you need to use super poly make sure you do not need cross crusader that turn.  <span>EXTRA DECK</span>  Pretty basic, no anki bc i needed more room. Dian bc if they fog blade or imperm your solid soilder you can dodge it and dian helps get out dark law if you can attack with it. Normal ratios for everything else. Two spots for super poly target. Also you can use Trinity as a side spot to put in another super poly target.  <span>SIDE DECK</span>  Pretty standard, use the 9 spots for good hand traps for decks you think you will face. Always have cards for backrow decks. Also some super poly targets. World chalice dragon is good against decks that link alot. Borreload fusion for dragon link. Great tornado can out winda or appolusa with super poly, and the shining for mechaba and for the dino boss monster. Remember you can super poly with your own face down monsters."

Force your opponent to waste resources while you draw your deck as quickly as possible.,"Once Mystic Mine and Field Barrier are up you can spam draw spells and generate lots of advantage. As long as they have more monsters you can flip up worm linxes. There is some gas with the draw power that allow you to set things up quickly.  You really only need to get one appropriate online, the other 2 are just for consistency. You don't have to hold on to the One Day of Peace or worry about the timing of the draw spells, except for the pots. If you banish 6 cards with 3 pot of extravagance you won't be able to use pot of disparity so you have to keep that in mind.  If you start to die you can use the low life points and draw of fate to get to exodia quickly. A lot of the draw spells allow you to get all the cards from draw of fate just keep an eye on the ones that shuffle the deck like pot of duality"

Deck Strengths and Weaknesses </span> <p><span><strong>Strengths</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>High versatility and flexibility</span></li>  	<li><span>High search power</span></li>  	<li><span>High chance to OTK if left uncontested</span></li>  	<li><span>Potential to play around hand traps and other negates</span></li>  	<li><span>Very consistent </span></li> </ul> <p><span><strong><span>Weaknesses </span></strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Very dependent on the Extra Deck and multiple special summons</span></li>  	<li><span>Despite high search power, there is low draw power</span></li>  	<li><span>Somewhat dependent on luck when excavating</span></li> </ul> <span>II. Key Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Adamancipator Tuners - While each has a different means of being summoned out, they all share the same effect: excavating the top 5 cards of your deck and special summoning a level 4 or lower non-tuner rock monster. In general, the easiest one to summon onto the field is <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> , followed by <a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a> , and then <a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a> . Researcher is a free special summon to your field as long as you control a rock monster. Seeker is a free special summon to your field as long as you control another Adamancipator monster (including synchros). Analyzer can only be special summoned if only your opponent controls monsters; he's easier to get out on the field going second compared to going first. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> - The reason this card works so well with this deck is that it is searchable by every adamancipator tuner, can be sent to the graveyard by <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> , and it's a one-card combo that starts your link climb. A single rocksies lets you link into <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu"">Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu</a> while special summoning a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dropsies"">Prank-Kids Dropsies</a> (you can't summon a rocksies off of another rocksies, which is why we play 1 dropsies). You can also banish a card from your hand to draw 1 when rocksies is sent to the graveyard. You can then link climb again into <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> using dropsies as link material. When dropsies hits the graveyard from this, you gain 1000 LP and can summon another rocksies from your deck. So you essentially end on where you started with a Link 2 Monster. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> - I like going into this guy after link climbing from the prank-kids engine. He can be summoned pretty easily with all of the level 4's in the deck- and combos especially well with <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> if included in your opening hand. Gallant Granite lets you search for <span>any</span> rock type monster in your deck; adamancipator tuners or even <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> . I usually search for the adamancipator tuner I haven't played yet (usually <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> ). After using the effect, I usually use him for link material for the next link climb (usually into <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> ).</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> - This can be easily summoned out through the prank-kids engine as long as you already have a level 2 tuner monster. This card excavates the top 5 cards of your deck and can summon <span>any</span> rock type monster. Usually you want to summon out either: one of the adamancipator tuners that you haven't summoned or <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> if you haven't link climbed yet. This card also combos with <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> if it's in the graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> - So...I'm part of the crowd that likes running Doki at 2 instead of 3. This is a monster that I love searching into instead of having it in my opening hand. It's for that reason and the fact that this monster requires a bit of setup that I run it at 2. This card does a great job at getting <a data-name=""Adamanipator Analyzer"">Adamanipator Analyzer</a> and <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> onto the field when you fail to search them. </span></li>  	<li><span>Koa'ki Meiru Monsters - I run 3 <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a> . These level 4 rocks are great to hit off of your adamancipator tuners. Koa'ki Meiru Guardian offers field protection and can potentially combo with <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> . Koa'ki Meiru Supplier does 2 things: it can add a Guardian to your hand when it's special summoned, and it can special summon itself to the field when a rock monster is sent from the field to the graveyard.</span></li> </ul> <span>III. Combos</span>  <span>Adamancipator Risens &amp; The Graveyard</span> <ul>  	<li><span>All Adamancipator Risens can excavate the top 5 cards of your deck for an effect; however, they also all have a secondary effect depending on if you have a certain attribute of monster in your graveyard. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> can quick effect remove a card from your opponent's graveyard (kind of like a <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> ) if there's a wind monster in your graveyard. Possible wind monsters: <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> and <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> . <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> can quick effect revive a rock monster from your graveyard during your opponent's turn if there's a fire monster in your graveyard. Possible fire monster: <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> . <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> can quick effect negate a spell/trap or effect if there's a water monster in your graveyard. Possible water monsters: <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dropsies"">Prank-Kids Dropsies</a> and <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> . </span></li> </ul> <span>Adamancipator Tuners &amp; <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a></span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> is a very versatile card. It can combo with <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> and it can also guarantee you being able to excavate a level 4 or lower rock type monster when using the adamancipator tuners. Of note: <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> effect is not 'once per turn' and it can potentially be searched by <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> .</span></li> </ul> <span>Prank Kids Engine &amp; Links</span> <ul>  	<li><span>The prank-kids engine is a one-card combo that gives you a free link 2 monster on the field, making it easy to link climb to your 3's and 4's. You start with a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> and end on a Prank-Kids Rocksies and a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> . With how easy it is to swarm link material to the field, your end goal is to get the big link 4's out including <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> for offense or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> for more control. Link climbing really helps set up your main beaters being: <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> since you're likely to have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> in the graveyard to be used by both. </span></li> </ul> <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> &amp; Ash Blossom &amp; <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a></span> <ul>  	<li><span>This combo is a bit situational only if you have <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in hand and a <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a> on the field. You can have Guardian tribute itself for a negate, then discard Ash for another negate. Since Ash is a fire attribute in the graveyard- Leonite can revive Guardian for another negate since it's effect isn't once per turn (total of 3 negates). </span></li> </ul> <span>IV. Tech Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Revival Golem"">Revival Golem</a> - Primarily going to be a <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target. Helps with rank 4 XYZ summoning and some synchro plays. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a> - This is your secondary <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target and also the only monster you can use to synchro summon into <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> . Keep in mind you need a rock monster (and only rock monsters) on the field for this to revive from the graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> - Another level 4 rock monster to use for XYZ or Synchro plays. It also helps with this deck's lack of draw power (not that it's needed, but it helps). </span></li> </ul> <span>V. Addressing Weaknesses</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This deck definitely struggles if you're locked out of using your extra deck since most of your combos and extenders involve using the extra deck. The good thing about the combos with this deck is that none of them rely on spell or trap support. If an opponent's spell or trap is preventing you from getting to your extra deck, you side in spell/trap negate such as <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> or <a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a> (especially since this deck doesn't use trap cards). If an opponent's monster is preventing you from getting to your extra deck, you could use cards such as <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or destruction cards such as <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> or <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> for budget. </span></li>  	<li><span>Despite this deck constantly throwing out special summons, it does not struggle heavily with <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> . It might be a slight inconvenience to get Nibiru'd, but more often than not- you can recover. You could special summon <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> since the token is a rock monster or you could trigger summon <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a> since your rock monsters would be tributed to summon the token. If your opponent locks you out of special summoning, then you may need to side in some extra cards for spell/trap/effect negation. </span></li>  	<li><span>This deck does an amazing job searching for rock monsters, but not for your handtraps or other tech cards like <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> . Besides what you get in your opening hand, there aren't many ways to draw cards aside from using <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> or <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> . Before reworking my extra deck, I used <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> to make up for the lack of draw power. I ended up cutting Saryuja in my extra deck since I preferred using other links, but he can be solid for the draw power and combo extension. </span></li>  	<li><span>Despite how consistent this deck is, there will always be some form of luck factor when using the adamancipator tuner effects. You could excavate the top 5 cards of your deck to hit 3 rock monsters, other times 1, and other times 0. Because of this, combos and strategies need to be thought up on the spot and require quick thinking. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> is a way to manipulate this luck factor by putting a level 4 or lower rock monster at the top of your deck. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> can also recycle itself to the top of the deck if Risen Dragite is on the field or in the graveyard (Risen Dragite returns to the extra deck). <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> is another option as a tech card to force a level 4 or lower rock monster from your hand to the top of your deck.</span></li> </ol> <span>VI. Tips and Tricks</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This deck excels more when going first to build a solid board full of negates. </span> <ol>  	<li><span>Going second isn't ideal, but it's fine with the amount of hand traps in the deck (8 total handtraps)</span></li>  	<li><span>This deck doesn't offer much spell/trap or monster destruction for going second, so <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> , <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> , <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> , <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> , etc. are good cards to side in when needed.</span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span>If you're trying to bait handtraps, <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> is usually a good card to bait it with, followed by the adamancipator tuners (granted you can guarantee having at least 2 monsters on the field). You 110% do not want to get handtrapped if you normal summon <a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> without a follow up. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> is situational, aside from searching for <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> or one of the tuners, you probably will want to synchro him away if you don't have <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in your graveyard. </span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> can be summoned easily when using Risen Leonite or Raptite as material. </span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> is a good handtrap when going second; however, you can still use its effect with monsters on the field when <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> is on the field. </span> <ol>  	<li><span>This doesn't come up often, but you can also special summon this through <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>. </span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span>This deck revolves around a certain combo path that depends with what you have in your opening hand. Ideally you want to go into your big link monsters first and then go into your big synchro monsters. </span></li>  	<li><span>This deck is very handtrap friendly because of all the possible one-card combos, so if you feel the need to side in more negates- could take out some of the tech cards such as <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> or <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> package. </span></li> </ol> <span>VII. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span> <ol>  	<li><span>I like using <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> for spell negate, but if you want to replace that and <a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>, then <a data-name=""Tackle Crusader"">Tackle Crusader</a> is another good <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target and <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> is another good synchro to use.</span></li>  	<li><span>If you want to abuse the <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> combo more, you can replace <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> with <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Bow-Wow-Bark"">Prank-Kids Bow-Wow-Bark</a> to use as a fire monster for your graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> is another good tech option to help set up for synchro plays and adamancipator tuner deck excavation (replace one of the Miracle Ruptures with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> if trying this)</span></li>  	<li><span>I use <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to change out my tuner levels if needed, but if you want to use its secondary effect, I'd consider replacing one of the extra deck monsters with <a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a> .</span></li> </ol>"

Both archetype's playstyle compliment each other, Evil★Twin can be used to pop Cursed Eldlad and it can provide extra disruption, while the Eldlich will take care of the grind game. The only problem of this deck that it's playstyle is so linear, if your opponent negates the right card, you'll be having a hard time winning that match. That's why you need to predict what disruptions will your opponent will use and when to commit or just play safe.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Main Deck Explanation</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Evil★Twin Cards - So this engine runs the typical ratios of: 3 Ki-sikill, 3 Lil-la, 3 Entrace, and 1 Secret Password, this cards is all you need to run when you're playing it alongside Eldlich, adding any other Evil★Twin cards or Cynet Mining will just make the deck more easire to stop.</li>  	<li>Eldlich Cards - I run 2 Golden Lord, 3 Cursed Eldland, 3 Scarlet Sanguine, 3 Conquistador, 1 White Destiny, and 2 Huaquero, I only run 2 Golden Lord since running it at 3 will be bricky, you have many ways to search for it. I only run 2 Huaquero  just to have extra access to Sanguine.</li>  	<li>Nibiru - A good card in today's fast paced gameplay.</li>  	<li>Ash Blossom - Self Explanatory. Most useful card in today's game.</li>  	<li>Ghost Belle - A good hand trap in today's meta since a lot of decks has GY reliant plays.</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity - The most expensive card in this deck, this card fixes the brick problem of this deck.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave - Self Explanatory card. Too bad it's limited.</li>  	<li>Ice Dragon's Prison - A really good card to disrupt your opponent since it can banish 2 monsters from your opponent.</li>  	<li>Imperial Order - A protection against backrow removal with a bonus of negating your opponent's spell cards.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Extra Deck Explanation</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>N'tss - To be honest i just put this card just to be used as a cost for prosperity. It's just a bonus if your opponent runs Dogmatika Maximus since you can use it to bait your opponent's negate.</li>  	<li>Pleiades - You can use the Huaquero and Conquistador to summon this card. A good card to disrupt your opponent's play while sending your Eldlich trap cards to the GY.</li>  	<li>Unchained Abomination - This card can let you control a game if you have right resources.</li>  	<li>Knightmares - So i run all Knightmares except gryphon, since their effects can come in clutch especially Unicorn. Also it's easier in this deck to maximize the co-link effects of Knightmares thanks to Evil★Twin.</li>  	<li>Evil★Twins - A self explanatory cards since you're using the Evil★Twin engine.</li>  	<li>Link Spider - I use this card just to send my summoned Eldlich trap card to the GY.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Side Deck Explanation:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Lancea - A good card in today's meta game since a lot of deck needs to banish cards in order to continue their combo. Some people put this card in the main deck, it's good but you need to analyze first your area's meta game before putting this card in the main deck.</li>  	<li>Harpie's Feather Duster - A must card if you're facing backrow deck.</li>  	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Literally a card that will let you play against combo decks that has an endboard of many negates.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - Also a must have card when facing a backrow deck.

This deck is mainly geared towards spamming the board using U.A's and generic warriors with easy special summoning conditions, like Fire Flint Lady and Red Layer. The main idea is to spam the board with monsters like Fire Flint and Red Layer at first, and then normal summon Midfielder to get more bodies on field for an automatic link 4. I built this deck so it can consistently get to Midfielder, using 2 field spells to search him, and Foolish Burial Goods to send  Penalty Box to search said field spells,  or if you already have them, Signing Deal for more field swarming. You also have Player Manager to get even more bodies on board, so with an ideal hand, you can get up to 5 bodies on board, meaning a link-4 and material to bounce back and force with U.A effects, as long as you leave a U.A on board. Isolde helps with leaving that board state in tact, as it can turn a Jersey into a Fire Flint Lady for combos. The extra deck is pretty  generic- Isolde is a great extender for the deck, as you can search for turn 2 and use Jersey to summon out a Flint lady to extend your plays. I also included generic Knightmares for removal, Missus Radiant if you have a ton of U.A's, and a few XYZ. The link 4's are the special part of this deck. Borrelsword is the OTK part of the deck, helping a lot to OTK when going second. Accescode is great as a going 1st option, and same with Powerload, as Powerload is a pretty strong towers. Any suggestions are appreciated. Have fun!"

First of a replay so you get an Idea : https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=447320-27026681  Now lets find something else to combo to. This time we focus on instead of not letting our opponent play, we will just make it so they cant interact with our cards and we throw as many stone in their way as possible. To make it simple I will copy my explantions for each card from the last list, just updated for all thats new.  Also remember, Laundry is the best Maid, even if she is the worst card.  Well I assume you are here to look at one of the endless versions of Dragonmaid decks. Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free Chaos ruler or Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time.  1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li> </ol> Dragons :  3 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  2-3 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With dragon link and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion.  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender.  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Miradora or Parlor  Hand traps : 3 Ash + 2 Bell. Could be anything, just increase amount and decreas and change which to use depending on meta / what is played were you play.  Extra :  1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.  2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more  1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid  1x Chaos Ruler : More draw and can resummon it self if needed. Also can send tidying which is a insane + for us  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess : If we dont go into Underworld Goddess, we usually go into her with I:p for the nice negates  1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones  1x Pitsy and Elpy : The extender dragons which hopefully get banned soon. Usually made with Nurse + any maid  1x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon  1x I:p  : We need her to link summon in the opponents turn + she is dark so rokket is a 1 card combo to her  1x Knightmare Unicorn : Generic link 3 which you can summon from I:P for another Interrupt  1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards  1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle  1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.  &nbsp;  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on  Borrel Savage + I:P + Five headed link dragon + Sheou = I:P + the maids summoned by Shoeu go into the new Link 5 and steal another Monster from the opponent  Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou  or if we eat to many hand traps, just a classic Sphere + Sheou  &nbsp;  If wanted I can later add a few replays to show combos and how the deck performs against meta / ranked on DB"

Who doenst love shaddolls, am i right? And of course the favorite non banned card Dragoon:)  its kinda the same as the others deck profiles but i like a couple of other ratio's.  So why no dogmatika? <ol>  	<li>if youre broke its kinda obvi you cant play the core</li>  	<li>its still good and maybe slightly better without the dogmatika (my humble opinion).</li>  	<li>Its kinda generic and easy to counter, while it locks you out of the extra deck and the extra deck is your heart and soul.</li>  	<li>Yes, what im about to say now is contradicting number 3 but the invoked package itself is good synergy but faces its drawbacks and yes i know a special summoned eclassia is good with the potential search of fleur dump of ash or maximus, but trust me normal summon aleister wins everytime ;)</li> </ol> Why 3 shaddoll fusion and 2 el shaddoll fusions?  Shaddoll fusion in this format is crazy good, your opponent will always have a extra deck monster. Yes you can ash the shaddoll fusion but your opponent burns there recources while you can activate anything else afterwards.  So with that in mind i chose to cut el shaddoll fusion to 2x.  3x times nibiru and 3x times ash: nibiru is a light monster so construct material and while dragon link is still dominating you need to have the nibiru to somewhat slow them down. Ash is Ash need no explanation.  Shaddoll core is every attribute you need but especially for shekhinaga (wich is underrated af, negate a special summoned monster effect while dumping a shaddoll card, im confused in why nobody is playing this more often).  2x beast because plussing is always lovely.  And last but not least, invoked package: because normal summon aleister and magical meltdown is still broken af.  extra deck is kinda standard tbh nothing special there.  maybe switch the shekinhaga for a second caliga to floodgate your opponent but everything works for me with these 15 cards.  extra deck:  i would always run 3x dimension shifter, 2x cosmic cyclone and harpies and if youre expecting alot of imperial orders side in heavy storm duster 3x and for this deck 3x ghost belle to protect.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

There was no other way I could seem to build this deck without the use of Nekroz. The board it typically ends on is Unicorn and Ruler. I also tried to make the deck as budget-friendly as possible. So yeah as for things like Anima, you can just put a second Linkuriboh. And Nibiru can be replaced with a handtrap of your choice. Honestly, this is a more fun build that can be semi-competitive. If I had to make any recommendations, honestly just buy at least one Nova, cause it just makes the deck that much better, and also the reason I'm not playing terraforming.  The main combo is using Thuban and Aldhiban to special them and search for your Kaleidoscope and Ruler. Then you can search Unicorn off of many things, or add the Drytron ritual monster and ritual spell instead. Your board is going to try to look as good as suppressive as possible. You can use Asterism as another form of interruption, and that's mainly what Fafnir does other than searching the ritual spell.  As for side decking, You mainly want to replace the Fafnir for any handtrap or your choice. The other Drytron ritual monster can replace the other in case you are facing a backrow heavy deck. The Nekroz ritual monster replaces the Trish and the Mirror replaces Cycle based on preference. The other 6 slots can be used on whatever you want.  Please don't judge me for doing this, I tried really hard. Budget recommendations are appreciated, so yeah have fun with this deck."

The deck's playstyle is focused around setting up the field with negates (primarly with Fog Blade), preventing opponent from activating effects and then on your next turn use Sword and Bardiche to clean as much as possible from opponents field and end it with either field full of 2000+ ATK monsters or over 9000 ATK Arc XYZ Dragon.  &nbsp;  I tested this deck in many duels until I put together the right cards that made it work and then tested it in another 20 duels.  Win rate is 85% (17/20) what is pretty good in in opinion.  (First duel I lost was againts Altergeist who went first so it was already over, the other 2 were because of brick hands)  &nbsp;  In 11 duels I played first and won 9 of those (1 of those was brick hand).  In other 9 I played second and won 8 of those.  It is clear that you have good chances of winning no matter if you go first or second, but I think going first gives you maybe 10% more chance of winning since you can set up your field.  &nbsp;  I had 4 OTKs (20%) during testing and only 2 brick hands (10%).  &nbsp;  Draw power is a total 0, but there are enough search effects that I don't think they are needed.  Twin Twisters are there to get rid of annoying or set spells/traps and to get some monsters in GY for future combos.  Accesscode is a second option for boss monster and Apollosa is there for extra negates.  Dante is good for getting resources, Leviar is for getting one more monster to the field for combos or summoning, Nightmare is nice since it can set up to 2 opponent's monsters when they are summoned.  &nbsp;  The main play is getting Bardiche to the field, set 1-2 Fog Blades, Artifact Scythe and Impermanence and then bring out XYZ and prepare for future plays.  &nbsp;  Now for those who think Tour Guide doesn't belong here's a simple 1 card combo to set up 2 monster negates or 1 negate+1 destruction (and there's chance you'll get at least 1 more negate with other cards from the hands)  &nbsp;  NS (normal summon) Tour Guide  SS (special summon) Cir (recomanded for opening plays) or Graff (recomanded for later plays)  SS Cherubini  Trigger Cir effect and SS either Scarm or Farfa or Graff to revive them from GY  Send either Cloak or Scales to HY with Cherubini effect  SS Bardiche  If you used Scarm use it to seatch any BA or Tour Guide at EP or if you used Farfa banish opponent's monster until EP (recomanded for finishing plays)  Use Bardiche to send either Cloak or Scales to GY (depanding on what you sent with Cherubini) and then set either Fog Blade or PK RUM Force  Banish Cloak and search Greaves  Use Scales' effect to SS it from GY and then use Greaves' effect to SP it from hand (keep it at lvl 3)  Use Scales to discard and send Boots to GY  Banish Boots to search either Fog Blade or PK RUM Force and set the card  SS Sword with Scales and Greaves (SS it next to Bradiche's link only if there's a card on opponent's field)  If opponent has a monster use Sword to kamize it and then revive Greaves and Scales and summon either R4 XYZ  If you want to destroy another opponent's monster SS Raider's Knight, use it's effect to SS 2nd Sword and repeat the play  On opponent's turn you can use RUM Force to SS either Raider's Knight or any XYZ Dragon to trigger Bardiche's effect and destroy another opponent's card or destroy Scythe if you have it set to lock opponent's ED  &nbsp;  There are couple more smaller combos which you'll easly learn by playing the deck (like how to get Arc Dragon over 10K ATK)  &nbsp;  EDIT: I noticed I uploaded a version with Droplet, Belle and Bringandine. I used multiple decks and kept them all to compare them later.

The requirements one must match to summon and keep them alive are absolutely bonkers specific, but this list attempts to play within them and get things online. Lots of traps, tutors, and long-term growth to attempt and stop plays and eventually kill with either <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> or a stalled-out <a data-name=""Wave-Motion Cannon"">Wave-Motion Cannon</a>.  45 cards, so three points. First two points are spent on two additional copies of <a data-name=""Dark Factory of Mass Production"">Dark Factory of More Production</a>, and the last is spent 50/50 on <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>.  The majority of raw card advantage in this list comes from <a data-name=""Dark Factory of More Production"">Dark Factory of More Production</a>, with <a data-name=""Legacy of the Duelist"">Legacy of the Duelist</a> occasionally blowing people out in a similar fashion. Cards like <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""House Duston"">House Duston, and </a><a data-name=""Kinka-byo"">Kinka-byo</a> create bodies, and those bodies can be used with the aforementioned cards. All of this (hopefully) leads to having a solid hand, board control, a mild bit of recursion, and a whole lot of countermagic.  Dustons, despite not being usable in a myriad of summoning methods, are just fine with being linked. This means that after poofing a <a data-name=""House Duston"">House Duston</a>, some modest link plays can be made within the 3-summon limit. Of course, your opponent will get some Dustons as well which they're able to link next turn, so you'll need to keep that in mind. If you do end up giving the opponent some Dustons, you can make it harder for them to make use of them with either <a data-name=""Starduston"">Starduston</a> or <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a>."

The main idea is to normal summon the Lightsworns and mill to hell and back, in order to activate as many Shaddol effects as possible. Since Shaddols have tons of good effects in the graveyard, the Lightsworns are a great engine for milling tons of Shaddols. This allows you to then get some Shaddols on board using some graveyard effects, allowing you to fuse into Construct and/or Winda fairly easily. The final core part of the deck is a Chaos package, as since you dump so many monsters into the grave rapidly, you can use the Chaos package to get extra bodies on board and even more effects. If you can pull Levianeer off right, you can even get a hand rip going first, which is amazing. Overall, this is a pretty consistent control deck that can get out floodgates and beaters and generally a solid deck imo."

While it will not be a meta dominant deck, the unshackling of Cir and Graff should make it very clear that Burning Abyss is not to be looked down upon. Thanks to cards like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>, <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a>, and the newly released <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, Burning Abyss is more than able to hold its own going first against most of the format. Barring blow-out cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, or a lucky snipe off of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> or <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>, the deck puts up a significant amount of pressure going 1st. While its ability to go 2nd is not as impressive, BA has a unique toolbox that allows it to bait out or remove some of the opponent's threats - potentially setting up for a Link 4 play with <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a> or a Rank 3 play into <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a>. And of course, BA, even in its newest iteration, still retains its bread and butter grind game that has led it to receive the title of ""the deck that never dies"". Cir, Graff, Dante, and Scarm are all fantastic cards that allow you to match pace with the likes of Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika, and Dragon Link should you be able to stabilize. With all of these traits and some smart siding, this is definitely one of the better formats to pick up your Malebranches of the Burning Abyss.  _________  <span><strong>Key Cards:</strong></span>  • <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a>: Yes, it is frail, but it is still the best card in the deck should it go off. Tour Guide is a ticket to Zeus, to <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and to just about every other meaningful monster in the deck, should it resolve. Even if you're not using it to explode, Tour Guide is a 1 card setup into I:P + Beatrice, or simply a Dante. This card cannot be overlooked, it simply offers unparalleled flexibility. <em>You just need to be careful </em><em>with cards like Nibiru, Impermanence, and Ash seeing increasing play.</em>  • <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a>: It's not a tour guide, but what it can enable might as well place it in the same tier.  The ability to send any Burning Abyss monster from the deck to the graveyard is extremely impactful. This effect allows Rhino to be used in a myriad of ways, whether that's making I:P + Beatrice (like Tour Guide) after being detached from a Dante to send Graff, or if it's to simply send Scarm for that valuable end phase search. Furthermore, its ability to protect your BAs from their self-destruction can allow you to extend on awkward boards, which is something that comes up from time to time and is highly valued.  • <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: After a certain point in a game, this often becomes the card you look for the most. Why? Well it enables your grind, it allows you to access a myriad of other cards you've set up over time, and it allows you to recur resources in conjunction with Dante. Cir is extremely impactful thanks to its effect that allows it to Special Summon a Burning Abyss monster from the graveyard.  • <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: A Hero Lives type effects have always been powerful, and one that is as easy to activate - and as flexible - as Graff is extremely powerful. Being able to tutor out any BA, or simply being able to extend, is extremely powerful in a deck like BA that can take advantage of graveyard effects by linking off bodies on the field.  • <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: Definitely not the most highly touted card, and considering it's at 1 in my list you may wonder I'm bringing it up at all. Well, it's because Libic is a powerful enabler. Libic enables specific combos and makes awkward hands less awkward, and it does it in a way that no other BA really can, which is something that's worth mentioning. Specifically, Libic allows Tour Guide to cash in on a Link 4, almost immediately. Tour Guide Summoning Graff to make Cherubini, summoning Scarm off of Graff to a zone Cherubini points to is a play that brings out a lot of bodies - but accomplishes little in the respect of developing a board. However, with Libic in the deck, and a BA name in hand, Cherubini allows you to get a 4th body on-field - opening up several lines of play. It's definitely not the most interesting combo, but Libic's place in this combo alongside its general resourcefulness is meritorious enough to mention.  • <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>: I'm certainly biased in this saying this, but I believe I'm pretty correct in saying it, Dante is one of the best rank 3s ever printed. The ability to mill 3 cards can be pretty powerful, especially in a deck like this where there are a lot of good cards to mill, but that's not the only way that Dante contributes. Its ability to swing for 2500 can be valuable, the fact that it is a Burning Abyss name is also valuable, but more than anything else, its non once per turn <a data-name=""Warrior Returning Alive"">Warrior Returning Alive</a> effect that triggers when sent to the graveyard, is incredible. It not only allows you to cycle back Cir, which can then revive your Dante to repeat this loop, but it allows you to bring back any BA. That is huge in a grind game, especially when you can resolve this effect of Dante multiple times.  • <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a>: She is still at 1, and maybe for good reason, however that limitation doesn't stop Beatrice from being an incredibly important piece of Burning Abyss's arsenal. The ability to send a monster from the deck to the graveyard during either player turn gives Beatrice the unique ability to not only develop advantage and plays, but also the ability to disrupt the opponent - sometimes in astounding fashion (ex: Sky Scourge Norelas, albeit this is not a competitive plan &amp; I am simply referencing it to show the potential that Beatrice has).  • <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a>: Yes, every Trap in this deck is powerful, but what Fiend Griefing does is pretty impressive even among its Trap peers. The ability to send a BA to the graveyard on your opponent's turn, while you're shuffling a card from their graveyard into the deck allows Fiend Griefing to be both a disruption and setup card - or a two-for-one interruption. That flexibility is huge, and often this card feels as if it were tailor-made for BA.  _________  <span><strong>Options to consider for Extra/Main/Side:</strong></span>  Aside from ratio adjustments, there are a few cards that should be considered when building Burning Abyss variants.  • Extra Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>: This card is very powerful if it resolves, allowing you to clear an entire board. Furthermore, you have cards like Fiend Griefing, Beatrice, a chained Dinomischus from GY, and Ice Dragon's Prison to resolve this card's effect on your opponent's turn. Do be wary though, it's an expensive investment at any point in the game, and you're left feeling fairly weak after it resolves in some situations.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>: This card's golden years are certainly behind it, but it is still a menace to deal with &amp; has a potentially game swinging effect.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a>: This card is a more recent tech for more grind-intensive matchups. It has its merits, but we're not looking to get into that kind of an end game with this deck. Play if you value the cycle, ignore if you don't.</p> • Main Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>: In this format Cyclone is just too good, both going 1st &amp; going 2nd. It always trades with a card that is critical for the opponent, or hard for you to play through, and I would certainly consider main decking it.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a>: The saturation of Traps in our Deck is high enough to make Back Jack reliable, and 1 - 2 Back Jack is certainly something worth implementing should you have space. It improves your Dante mills and helps maintain or increase this deck's pressure throughout the game.</p> <p>-&gt; Dragoon Package: <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, and your 2 Fusion targets. This package is extremely powerful on the right board, but it is not something I value highly format in this format. Given that most people are siding in Dark Ruler, this feels weak in games 2 &amp; 3 and there are generally plays that are equivalent to or better than Dragoon, with I:P + Beatrice on turn 1 and Zeus/Accesscode on turn 2 (or when going 2nd).</p> • Side Deck: <p>-&gt; Kaijus / <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: They don't help you win against Dragon Link as <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> does, but they can be useful for outing combo boards as well as troublesome monsters like <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> and <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. (It should be noted that an Invoked Shaddoll player can utilize Schism to play through your Kaiju and set up a second Winda.)</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>: Another card that fulfills the same role as Dark Ruler, albeit with more swing potential. I don't play it over Dark Ruler because it doesn't synergize as well with this variant of BA given that we play a high number of Traps and are unlikely to find many cards that we want to discard as consistently.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>: Nearly every deck in the current format does not appreciate playing under Droll, the issue is that there are still plenty of Decks that can create a problematic board through Droll. It is certainly one of the better hand traps in this format, it is just hard to warrant playing hand traps in this Deck when you value cards that trade more consistently and efficiently.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: Not often a game-winner on its own, and hence why it is being offered as a recommendation, Nibiru can end a Dragon Link or Bird Up players turn should they open poorly enough / should it be supported enough. Considering that we prefer consistent responses to the current format's combo decks, I would say this is a fringe consideration at best.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>: We play trap trick so this has some advantages over Lightning Storm, which is the card this would most likely replace in the side. Not much else to say, Evenly is fantastic into Eldlich, Shaddoll, and a slew of other Decks.</p> _________  <span><strong>Elementary Combos:</strong></span> <em> Isn't BA just IP, Beatrice &amp; set 3 pass?</em> ... <em>yes, but we like to think it's more than that </em> • Tour Guide:  -&gt; Link 4 Variation: TG 1.)

I Utilized The Most Consistent Choice Of Cards And Also Situational. I Hardly Ever Have To Side Against Anything Except Backrow Heavy Decks (If Needed Otherwise 2 Of Each Epsilon And Delta). Dino Was Def A Good Pick Be That After His Cost To Tribute Gives You More Chances To Peak Out Your Opponents Interruptions, Especially If You Have More Psy Monsters In Hand. I Don't Run Multiple Copy's Of Mining Because They Proved To Be Bricks In Most Cases And I Almost Always See A Cyberse Engine Starter To Not Only Summon Lambda But To Draw A Free Card And Spin Back With Link Disciple. Upstart Goblin Is Only There To Dig. Drowning Is A Card That Hardly Anyone Expects In This Format And A Clear Field Definitely Draws In An Attack. Even Nib Plays A Role To Get Out Lambda As Well. If Your New, I Guaruntee It Wont Take Long To Learn Its Basic End Board. I Hope Whomever Plays This Build Enjoy Stopping Almost Every Play Your Opponent Can Dish Out And Hopefully To Even Improve The Deck To Becoming A Superior Competition."

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.  &nbsp;  The Phantom Knights is an archetype based around XYZ summoning, as well as banishing themselves from the graveyard to activate their effects. They also have trap monsters, but for the most part, they are not used.  Here are my card ratios and explanations:  Monsters:  3x Torn scales: The best starter in the deck. His effect is to discard a card to foolish burial a phantom knights.  Normally, you will send cloak, as cloak can banish itself from the grave to search. Torn scales also summon itself from the grave when another phantom knight is banished from the grave, making him a useful extender.  3x Ancient cloak: Ancient cloak can make one dark monster you control gain 800 atk, but that's not really important. When he's in the grave, he can banish himself to search a phantom knights card, namely boots.  3x silent boots: An extender who can special summon himself if you have a phantom knights monster, which makes this card a perfect target for searching. By banishing himself from the grave, he can search a phantom knights spell or trap, making his a useful card all around  2x ragged gloves: If he is an overlay material, the card he is equipped to gain 1000 atk. His more useful effect is to banish him from the graveyard to mill a phantom knights card, which can activate any other phantom knights graveyard effect. 3 is a little bricky, which is why I run 2.  1x: An extender that can summon itself from the hand when another phantom knight is summoned, and can banish itself to summon a phantom knight from the hand. Both of these effects can also raise a cards level by one, but that rarely comes up. One copy because it's just okay.  &nbsp;  BA engine:  3x Tour guide: a good starter, always summon graff with its effect to go into cherubini, unless graff is in your harnd, in which case you go into libic to summon graff  1x graff: send of of cherubini, or summon off of tour guide. Summon cir with his effect, unlessc cir is in hand, then ss libic to ss cir1x  1x Cir: ss off of graff, and revive cherubini  1x libic: in case you draw graff or cir  &nbsp;  Extenders:  3x kagemucha knight, 1x psychic welder, 1x psychic tracker, 1x jackalope, 1x tsuchinoko: Generic level 3 extenders to xyz or link  &nbsp;  Dragoon package:  1x red-eyes, 1x dark magician: For dragoon  &nbsp;  Hand traps  3x Ash: Generic, can be used with level 3 extenders if bricked  &nbsp;  Spells:  1x Monster reborn: Generic extender  1x Foolish burial: can mill what you need  1x reinforcement of the army: can search what you need  1x red eyes fusion: dragoon package  1x rank up magic force: Gets into your rank 5's, searchable with boots and bardiche  &nbsp;  Traps:  3x fog blade: Monster negate searchable off of boots and bardiche  1x wing: sendable off of gloves, banishes itself from the grave to ss a knight from the grave1x  1x Brigandine: Searchable trap monster, easy summon for extending  &nbsp;  Extra deck:  1x dragoon: Dragoon package, gets extra negate going first and is easy to summon because cherubini stays on board most of the time  1x dark requiem: 3 monster negates, And summon xyz monsters from the grave, best xyz monster going first.  1x Arc rebellion: Otk with raider's knight.  1x Dark rebellion: Rank up with rank up magic force into requiem.  1x raider's knight: can rank itself up into arc rebellion going second.  1x Nightmare: can disrupt opponents plays.  2x break sword: Pop a card on the field, then xyz into rank 4.  1x leviair: Extender, can ss banished monsters.  1x Borrelsword: Close out games, over accesscode because it doesn't need link monsters for its full potential.  1x unicorn: Generic rank 3  1x Rusty bardiche: Can mill a phantom knights to set a spell/trap from the deck, and can pop a card when a dark xyz is summoned to it's zone. Very useful, end on board with him as much as possible to set fogblade.  1x Cherubini: Combo wombo by milling graff, summoning cir, summoning bardiche, cir revives cherubini, use for anaconda etc.  1x verte anaconda: dragoon package  1x link spider: For brigandine  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  To show you how to play this deck, here is a 1.5 card bread an butter combo that requires scales + discard  NS scales, dicard to mill cloak  banish cloak, search boots  ss boots  link into cherubini  activate cherubini, mill graff  graff summon cir  link into bardiche  cir ss cherubini  activate bardiche, set rank up magic if first, fog blade if you want arc rebellion Otk, mill gloves  banish gloves, mill wing  activate sclaes, ss itself  banish wing, ss boots  xyz into break sword where bardiche points to  if first, pop break sword, if second, pop one card on the opponents field, then activate break swords effect to pop itself and one more card on opponents field  activate break sword, ss boots and scales as level 4s,  if you want dark requiem, xyz into dark rebellioj. If you want arc rebellion, go into raiders knight, then activate effect to go into arc  This combo ends with either3 nagates on your opponent turn when you rank up into requiem, or an easy otk plus 1 negate if they survive with arc rebellion.  I hope this guide helped! thanks for reading this far.  &nbsp;"

designed to run all three main ways players win with @ignister so that way you have multiple options to go into giving you more diversity and making it harder for opponents to stop you, you should commonly win with one of the following, accesscode, darkfluid, or arrival of cyberse.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All three have strengths and flaws so pick one accordingly!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The arrival of cyberse is powerful but it’s also hard to bring out the best version and only provides one pop a turn.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Accesscode talker is immune to effects and can pop multiple cards in one turn but it doesn’t boast the attack of the arrival.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can one card out a 4 counter darkfluid but it loses 2500 attack every time it negates something and it can only negate monsters and doesn’t destroy, plus it isn’t immune and it’s multi attack effect is very conditional.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I believe that you can make igniters very adaptable if you choose for them to be that way, there are 12 cards in

The order isn't perfect in this replay, but you get the idea.  <em><strong>Card choices:</strong></em>  <strong>Virus:</strong> This makes the deck a 43-card deck, BUT I think it fits perfectly as a finisher for the combo, you draw into it very consistently and you get hand information for your opponent  <strong>Diabolos Engine:</strong> Darkest Diabolos, Levianeer and Symphony are very good in this deck. Your opponent starts with -2 cards as well as having to fight through the other negations.

Getting out a massive Gren Maju beat stick, or resolving Inferno Tempest paired with Necroface.  Gren Maju gains 400 ATK and DEF for each of your banished cards. Golden Castle forces you to banish 10 cards each standby phase while protecting your monsters and some free bodies on the field. The Kaijus are played to not only get over problematic monsters but to also ensure that your opponent has a monster with a high enough ATK so that you can resolve Inferno Tempest by crashing one of your monsters with 0 ATK into it. That is the reason for the 0 ATK Hand traps and the Crab King.  When you resolve Inferno tempest, each Necroface that is banished will activate and force your opponent to mill 15 cards, right after Inferno Tempest banishes every monster in their deck! Once you pass your turn your opponent will most likely have 0 cards in deck and you'll win off of mill!  &nbsp;  Better Format Info Link: <a><span>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unnQJXRb7O_Td0xpCGJ1z6r6gzUtjpc6ixhJFIM2BtI/edit#</span></a>  Join Our Discord! <a><span>https://discord.gg/TmnQWQNB</span></a>  Other ""Better Format"" Decks: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/frog27v/""><span>https://ygoprodeck.com/author/frog27v/</span></a>"

I think the deck is pretty much self-explanatory.  Anyways, the main idea is to OTK your opponent with  Shimmering Scraper.  To achieve that you have several tools to deal with disruptions of your opponent.  The side deck can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day everyone!"

Super Polymerization works to take out opponent monsters that can't be gotten around, while activating grave effects. Minerva is useful at getting more cards in either the grave or hand, Curious is good for sending specific cards to the grave, and Shaddoll Construct is good for getting another fusion Shaddoll out. Judgement Dragon and Chaos Emporer Dragon - Envoy of the End are the two good beatsticks that can special summon themselves thanks to cards in the grave.  Biggest flaw is the chance of sending too many to the grave too fast, causing your own defeat, which I'm trying out different ways to avoid it.  This deck is still a work in progress, and if anyone has any tips, I'm open for suggestions"

It's got some very explosive effects that are kept in line with some very harsh xenolocks. It's a very unique playstyle for a pendulum deck that can out grind almost anything if you can force the game into such a state.  The deck is intended to be able to go first or second but is better off going second in order to make use of Abyss Actor - Comic Relief, which is one of the most effective tools the deck has.  DECK SIZE: I recommend running between 43-50 cards in your deck when playing Abyss Actors. This is because you want to reduce the chances of opening too many of the Abyss Scripts in your deck, you can also start generating advantage with any abyss actor and any pendulum monster so the extra cards don't result in brick often; however, I wouldn't go beyond 50 as the deck sometimes struggles going first if the opponent has a blowout response on the second turn.  ABYSS ACTORS: All the 3-of Abyss actors are cards that are going to be your main combo pieces that you will use nearly every duel. the 2-ofs are also extremely good but you often do not need multiples. the one-ofs are niche, but you need them in order to have answers to some boards. I typically only side out of 2 copies of Curtain Raiser or Extras if I'm going first or second, but you need minimum one of each regardless of turn order. As for the Abyss Scripts, the only required ones are 2 copies of Abysstainment, which can be searched and and then used to recycle the other scripts while also having one of the best secondary script effects. Rise of the Abyss King is a stellar piece to bait out negation and break boards. I only run less than 3 due to size concerns. Opening Ceremony has an AMAZING effect when popped and has niche uses in very grindy games. Fantasy magic is the weakest script, but it is a searchable out to Dragoon, and other untargetable threats (this could be a 3rd Rise or a Romantic Terror if you're not afraid of Dragoon).  GOING FIRST: Going first is the weaker option for this deck, you won't be able to set up that heavy of a board every time as you will often end up xenolocking yourself to only abyss actors, which do very little to interrupt your opponent. The main disruptions you will be trying to achieve are the following:  Field Spell Setup: either a live Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater or a set Metaverse to go into Mystic Mine. This is either a full stun or a negate + pop of a set script which hopefully gets you by to you're next turn where your advantage will crush the opponent.  Amorphage setup: Amorphage Sloth can be searched with revolution dragon (which can be searched with sky Iris) and summoned with extreme ease with Abyss Actor - Hyper Director. If you can also grab lechery you can also turn off spells for your opponent.  Metaphys Horus: Halqifibrax + a level 4 abyss actor can turn into a formula synchron and then a Metaphys Horus which will steal a monster and negate a card.  If you can't get those, your last ditch options will be number 41, turn 1 vortex, or Archethys. If you can live a turn and not lose your generated advantage to specific blowout cards you will be in a stellar position to control the flow of the duel from then on.  GOING SECOND: Going second is very free form, prioritize getting out as many ED summons as you can out first before xenolocking yourself to Abyss Actors, then attempt to remove problems with Rise of the Abyss King and Comic relief. Popping a key Abyss Script should be next priority as most decks that didn't OTK you won't be able to keep pace with you once you've popped Opening Ceremony or Abysstainment. This deck is very capable of dismantling very big boards with a lot of negates with most of its hands.  MYSTIC MINE: This deck can play liberally while under mystic mine.  Abysstainment, Curtain Raiser, and Superstar make a small engine that can let you continually reuse scripts and generate advantage, all while getting rid of all your monsters before the end phase. If you can find space for a Duelist Alliance package, strongly consider running Pendulum Switch, which under your own mystic mine can allow you to clog your opponents board with comic reliefs and deny them outs that aren't spells. You could also run more copies of Mystic Mine, but you don't want to brick and you already can search it via terraforming/metaverse.  &nbsp;  EVENLY and ZEUS: This deck's biggest weakness is Divine Arsenal AA Zeus - Sky Thunder, and the even more deadly Evenly Matched. There is very little you can do against these kinds of blowouts, and even worse you lose all the advantage you've generated, which normally gimps your rebuttal and ends the duel. It's extremely dangerous going first if you know your opponent is running it. You should always avoid going first against decks with this option if you can."

Our cool and epic Ritual friends that had quite the spotlight in the meta, and will return once Lightning Overdrive releases! I remember being hyped for them since the first leak, and being super excited that it would be my first Ritual deck.  New to this archetype? Want to understand some tricks and combos with this deck? Let me explain how my build works, starting with a brief description of what each card does!  LEGEND: PSY-Frame Driver will be in <span>NEON GREEN</span> (he is special, like my homie PSY-Frame Pepega) Effect Monster names will be in <span>ORANGE</span> Ritual Monster names will be in <span>BLUE</span> Spell card names will be in <span>GREEN</span> Trap card names will be in <span>PINK</span> Extra Deck Monster names will be in <span>RED</span>  Let's start with the Drytrons!  Drytron Monsters:  <span>Drytron Alpha Thuban</span>- The Ritual Monster searcher. Shares MVP status with <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span> and <span>Zeta-Aldhibah</span>. <span>Drytron Beta Rastaban</span>- The GY Returner. Only one-of because he won't be used as much. <span>Drytron Delta Altais</span>- The Draw card. Helps with the deck's lack of draw cards. <span>Drytron Gamma Eltanin</span>- The Reinforcement-caller. He will greatly aid in gathering material for a Ritual Summon. <span>Drytron Zeta Aldhibah</span>- The Ritual Spell searcher. Will start you off by fetching <span>Meteonis Drytron<span>.</span></span> <span>Drytron Meteonis Draconids</span>- B I G  B O I. If he's Ritual Summoned with a total level of 2 or 1, he can attack all of your opponent's Special Summoned monsters! Can also banish Drytrons from the GY whose ATK equals 2000 or 4000 to pop your opponent's face-up cards for every 2000 ATK. <span>Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids</span>- S/T destroyer. Untargetable by S/Ts, and has a GY effect that revives 2 Drytrons from the GY to set up for more Ritual Summons, ideally <span>Draconids</span> or <span>Nekroz of Trishula</span>.  Drytron Spells &amp; Trap (Yes, they only have one Trap card, and I personally think it's swag.):  <span>Drytron Fafnir</span>- Retrieves a Drytron S/T upon activation, and protects <span>Meteonis Drytron</span> from negation. Its other effect is supposed to lower your monster lvls so the Drytron Rituals can activate one of their effects, but is hardly used. <span>Drytron Nova</span>- Special Summons a Drytron from your deck, but destroys it at the End Phase. Usually the start of some spectacular plays! <span>Meteonis Drytron</span>- Ritual summons almost any Ritual in the game from your hand or GY! It also has a GY effect that, by having a Drytron lose 1000 ATK for a little, puts itself back in your hand! <span>Drytron Meteor Shower</span>- Bounces your opponent's Normal/Special summoned monster back into the deck if you control a Ritual (once-per-turn). Technically, this card can be used in ANY Ritual deck, since you only need a Ritual on your field.  Now for the other useful cards/staples! Some of these cards help the deck's consistency, and some are meant as means to counter your opponent.  Let's jump into the Monsters!  <span>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span>- Speaks for herself. For new players, this card says ""No!! &gt;:( "" to your opponent's search, sending from deck to GY, or Special Summon from the deck. <span>Vanity's Ruler</span>- While on the field, prevents the opponent from Special Summoning. <span>Relinquished</span>- YOINKS an opponent's monster, equips it to itself, and gains ATK/DEF based on that monster. Your opponent also takes the same damage as you from attacks with it, and can destroy it's equip for protection. <span>Cyber Angel Natasha</span>- Her LP-gain is really neat, but that's not why she's here. Her attack negation effect is non-OPT, so she can stall while you gather resources. Her third effect, however, steals an opponent's monster and Special Summons herself from the GY by banishing another Cyber Angel! <span>Cyber Angel Benten</span>- Newly Limited because of an abusable non-OPT effect. You won't use her first effect a lot, but her second effect searches another LIGHT Fairy. Usually your search target will be <span>Vanity</span>. <span>Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</span>- Ritual Hand-trap! Discard effect negates the activation of a card that targets a monster you control. Second effect, if it's on the field, bounces itself to negate and banish an opponent's Special Summon. <span>Nekroz of Trishula</span>- Once Ritual Summoned, banishes 1 card each from your opponent's hand, field, and GY! (Non-targeting, btw). It's discard effect will come in handy if you swap <span>Nekroz of Unicore</span> from the Side Deck.  Take a look at the Spells!  <span>Cyber Emergency</span>- Drytrons and Cyber Dragons share custody of this card. Searches all Drytron monsters. If it's negated, use it's effect to discard a card and add it back to your hand! <span>Foolish Burial</span>- Self-explainatory. Sets up for <span>Meteonis Drytron</span>, <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span>, etc. <span>Preparation of Rites</span>- Level 7 or lower Ritual searcher. If <span>Meteonis Drytron</span> is in the GY, this also lets you recover it for free! <span>Terraforming</span>- Searches <span>Drytron Fafnir</span>. <span>Called by the Grave</span>- Hand-Trap counter. (In my opinion, should come off the banlist) <span>Relinquished Fusion</span>- Fusion Summons <span>Millennium-Eyes Restrict</span> by banishing <span>Relinquished</span> and an effect monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. Its GY effect lets you equip an effect monster your opponent controls to <span>Millennium-Eyes</span>.  The Extra Deck! This is going to be the confusing part. There isn't any go-to strategy with what's in here, especially with Mu-Beta-Fafnir coming later. I will be explaining some plays you can pull off with each member, but how you start is up to you.  <span>Millennium-Eyes Restrict</span>- Can equip a monster from your opponent's GY to itself when they activate a monster effect. Once equipped, your opponent cannot attack with/activate cards with the same name! <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span>- This baby's got 3 things going on: One, acts as a slightly different Macro Cosmos, banishing cards sent from the Hand/Deck to the GY. Two, can tribute itself to negate &amp; destroy a Spell/Trap/Monster Effect activation. Three, adds a Ritual Monster OR Spell if it's sent to the GY! <span>Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</span>- Can attack directly and material for <span>AA-ZEUS</span>. The more materials used to Xyz summon it, the more ATK and attacks it gains! <span>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</span>- FIELD NUKE. <span>Linkuriboh</span>- He's vibing. Changes an opponent's attacking monster's ATK to 0 and recurring Link material <span>Relinquished Anima</span>- Steals a monster it points to and gains ATK based on the monster it yoinked. <span>Geonator Transverser</span>- Protects what it points to from your opponent's card effects, and can switch control of what it points to. <span>Herald of the Mirage Lights</span>- Its negation effect will be more useful in a different build, but it's second will be useful in this one. If it's sent to the GY by an opponent's card, it searches up to 2 Ritual monsters/spells with different names. <span>I:P Masquerena</span>- Link-2 that protects whatever Link monster that uses it as material from destruction effects. <span>Knightmare Unicorn</span>- Generic Link-3 that bounces an opponent's card to the deck. <span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</span>- Generic Link-4 that helps with negation. <span>Borrelsword Dragon</span>- Angy. Will help clean up game.  Last stop on our tour through this deck is the Side Deck! This is my first Side, as I never had one for ANY of my other decks. I figured that if I want to use this deck in a Tournament, I should find out how to put one together. ALTHOUGH, I believe that you (yes, you! the one with the amazing face!) should be in charge of what the Side looks like. You can follow what mine looks like, or make one that's more suited to your dueling needs.  That aSIDE, let's jump in!  <span>PSY-Frame Driver</span>- Needed in order to use <span>Gamma</span>. Useful as Link Material. <span>PSY-Framegear Gamma</span>- Another handtrap. Negates an opponent's Monster effect if you have no monsters, and very useful going second. Can be used as Link material alongside Gamma, but can also be used to Synchro <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span> (with the help of two Drytrons. <span>Gamma Eltanin</span> helps with this). <span>Artifact Lancea</span>- Hand-trap that prevents banishing. <span>Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</span>- Tributes an opponent's pesky monster. <span>Nekroz of Unicore</span>- Negates the effects of your opponent's Extra Deck monsters. <span>Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon</span>- When Special Summoned, bounces your opponent's S/Ts, and your opponent can't activate anything in response! Also, while on the field, forces your opponent to pay 500 LP to activate card effects! <span>Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord</span>- If Ritual Summoned, skips your opponent's MP1. Also negates the effects of Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span>- Beater with DOUBLE Piercing damage and cannot be targeted/destroyed by card effects! <span>Lord of the Red</span>- When a card/effect is activated, he can pop a monster OR a S/T! <span>Cyber Angel Vrash</span>- Extra Deck Scourge. If Ritual Summoned, can destroy as many Extra Deck monsters your opponent controls and, if you do, inflicts 1000 damage for each and, if you do, can make 2 attacks! She also has an effect that can negate an effect &amp; destroy something that would destroy a card by shuffling a Ritual from the GY. <span>Dark Ruler No More</span>- Negates your opponent's monster effects and cannot be responded to!  COOL TIPS!  - One go-to is utilizing <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span> to revive another Drytron to set up for a Ritual or a Link-2. - Summon <span>Sauravis</span>, use it's on-field effect, then you can use it's discard effect in the same turn. - <span>Millennium-Eyes</span> can target &amp; equip Hand-traps in your opponent's GY, preventing your opponent from activating ones with the same name. - After summoning <span>Nightingale</span>, attack as much as you can before summoning <span>AA-ZEUS</span>. - <span>Relinquished Anima</span> can steal the <span>Jizukiru</span> summoned to the opponent's field, becoming free removal and free beater. - <span>I:P</span>, in tandem with <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span>, can bring out <span>Apollousa</span> or <span>Borrelsword</span> during your opponent's turn. - <span>Odd-Eyes</span> is helpful with your opponent's combos, as they have to keep lowering their LP to get where they want, and helps set up for a swift finish with <span>Chaos MAX</span> or any big body. - Combine <span>Unicore</span> with <span>Amorphactor</span> to hamper your opponent's Extra Deck monsters further.  Thank you for your time and interest!"

Atlandis obliterará la vida de tu oponente usando la fuerza de Argent! The pinnacle of human science!

Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army: </strong>Nos da cualquier guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Envía a Cloak o Boots para traer a este último o a Brigandine respectivamente.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>  	<li>El deck protege el paso final con Apollousa, sólo por si acaso.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que le afectan los incrementos de LP del oponente, aunque sólo si ocurren luego del efecto de Chaos Atlandis.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

The main monster you want to focus on is Guardian Angel Joan who will be a ""boss monster"" of some sorts, the main 2 ways to get them out is Tribute Burial and Apprentice Piper. Once you have summoned Guardian Angel Joan the next part of the strategy comes into play, use as many equip spells to raise their ATK to a really high number (preferably 3 United We Stand and either 2 Axe of Despair or Mage Power). This will allow you to destroy nearly any monster your opponent summons and gain A LOT of LP. Most of the cards in the Extra Deck are for when you are in a pinch and have no other choice.  Use Different Dimension Capsule and Gold Sarcophagus to search for the cards you need, use Gold Sarcophagus for the more valuable cards.  Use Absorbing Jar in conjunction with Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird."

Based on real-life Carnivorous plants and insects Traptrix are an archetype that utilise trap cards, in particular the trap-hole cards to generate advantage and control the flow of the game to deadly effect with the most important member being Traptrix Sera. Tho the traphole cards have long existed in the game it wasn't until 2013 with the release of Myermole and Dionea did the archtype as we know it come into existence Culminating with the release of Sera and Allomerus in late 2018 finally allowing the deck to stand on its own. </span></p> <span>There are now multiple varients of Traptrix some of which have enjoyed success including Dogmatika which is the most well known as well as Paleo, Pure and Zoo! But what I'm showcasing today is my take on the artifact build which not only seeks to deny oppenents use of the extra deck but help overcome the decks reliance on going first by utilising super poly to compliment the Build. </span>  <span>  <strong>Why Artifacts?</strong> Artifacts have a long history with traptrix and thanks to sanctum and Dagda can continue to work alongside each-other annoying players everywhere. Artifacts bring multiple tools to the table, Primarily locking out your oppenents extradeck but also punishing your oppenents for destroying precious backrow and bring out bodies to aid the decks snowball potential. As an example Your oppenent MSTs Sanctum while haveing 2 monsters, You Chain and Summon Moraltach. When it resolve Moraltach and sanctums In grave effect trigger and now you can take out your oppenents 2 monsters while possessing a body. Dagda can force your opponents into awkward styles of play to dodge additional artifact summons and if you hard draw them just set them and laugh when your opponent drops duster. You could simply just wait for your opponent to waste there normal and then activate sanctum to use scythe. </span>  <span>All This helps protect the Vital Backrow and often proc Sera</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Why Super Polymerisation? </span></strong><span>Assuming your not buster, domain or Spell locked is traptrix's get out of jail card helping us go 2nd where cards like DRNM, Kaijus, Droplets or Dark Hole/Raigeki cant since unless we open perfectly lack the tools to exploit those. Additionally it doesn't hinder the deck going first since it can double as an interupt something other blow-out save for Set Torrential Tribute or Evenly if you survive cant do. It does this while giving <em>your deck another body</em> again reducing another problem traptix face, Lack of Bodies an opportunities to snowball. Only nibiru is really comparable and that be played around. </span>  <span>Simply Super poly with only a few extra deck slots helps Traptrix immensely and compliments the artifact part of the deck by punishing usage of the extra</span>  <span> <strong>Card Choice explanation and guide: </strong>The Deck Obviously centres around Sera so 3 of Each <em>Myrmeleo, Mantis and Dionea</em> are taken as they have effects best compliment her while <em>Parallel Exceed</em> rounds out the monster part of the engine as it almost always equals a free Raffleslia, Knightmare or Allomerus depending on the scenerio for further extension. One Of each Artifact <em>Moraltach</em> and <em>Scythe</em> are mained as you only  need a turn of extra-deck lockdown to win and multiple can be garnets. Moraltach is complimentry. <em>Ash Blossom</em> and <em>Phantasmy</em> are my handtraps of Choice with the latter Shuffling back Hard Drawn Scythes and digging for Super-poly  <em>Monster Reborn</em> and Triple <em>Super Polymerisation</em> are the decks only spells with Super poly being the more important. Due to being quick-play its usable first or 2nd and compliments Traptrix unlike other blow out cards since it can be set as an interupt or to remove problems going 2nd. The amount of time this card has gotten me wins is uncountable.  We Finally come to the Traps With the Standard<em> Triple Floodgate, One Bottemless and One Gravediggers trapholes </em>as they offer the most versatility with minimum space taken up but lets face it, floodgate is just the most trollish. <em>Phantom Knights Shade Brigidane</em> is also a 3 off as it in conjunction with sera can generate a +2 that can then be lead into Time Thief Redeor or another Extra deck Monster. Artifact Sanctum Triggers Scythe and Moraltach and if your oppenents destroy the card you get to blow up one. Trap Trick seaerchs a trap while 3 Dinomiscus, 2 Icy Dragons Prison and a lone Lost Wind round out the deck Offering banishment and resource recursion. </span>  <span><em><strong>2 Sera</strong> </em>is mandatory as shes the entire foundation Traptrix are built on. You lose your first, You have a spare. Always take atleast 2. Afterwards one of each <em>Rafflesia and Allomerus</em> are taken with the former offering a defence and the latter offensive comboing with Dionea and Myrmeleo to climb into knightmares of which you have 1 of each of the standard <em>Cerebus, Phoenix and Unicorn. </em><em>Artifact Dagda</em> rounds out the artifact Lineup Offering additional chances to re-use artifacts. <em>Borrelsword</em> is the decks win-con and Oh-crap moment card and thanks to allomerus and Sera you would be surprised how easy it is to summon. <em>Abyss Dweller, Daigusto Emeral</em> and <em>Time Thief Redoer</em> round out the XYZs. <em>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</em> and <em>Mudragon of the Swamp</em> Are the primary super poly targets with <em>Earth Golem</em> being in my build solely because my meta has a few salad players but could easily be swapped for gravity Controller or Grypon if the player wished as they open up chances to recycle cards.</span>  <span> <strong>The Sidedeck:</strong> Pretty much dependant on the meta but <em>Torrential Tribute</em> should always be somewhere in a traptrix deck alongside the standard Imperial Order, Mind Control and Prankertops. Afterwards its a matter of Choice. I run 3 <em>Artifact lancea</em> to hurt decks reliant on banishment and it works with sanctum. <em>Gryphon and Bagooska</em> give me extra deck alternative to super poly targets if I'm forced to side it out. with <em>Anti-spell Fragerence</em> and <em>Nibiru</em> finishing out the deck. </span>  <span> <strong>Basic Plays for those interested in traptrix otherwise skip to decklist: </strong></span> <ul>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Normal Mantis or Myrmeleo preferable and Search Otherwise any traptrix is fine &gt; Link into sera and set any traps</span></p> </li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Do as above &gt; Set Shade Brigidane and immediately activate &gt; Trigger Sera and Summon Myrmeleo &gt; Activate Myrmeleo and resolve, Activate Sera and Set a Traphole Direct From Deck &gt; Either Link for Dagda or XYZ into Rafflesia, Abyss dweller, Time Thief or any Rank 4</span></p> </li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Do First Play &gt; Activate Parallel Exceed &gt; Summon Rank 4 </span></p> </li>  	<li><span>Activate Super Poly, Then do Stuff</span></li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Summon Knightmare while Sera is presnt and ensure Co-link.

Magicians' Souls - If you have a bad hand, it can help you, just don't discard other good cards. 2. Spellbook of Secrets/Spellbook Magician of Prophecy - Basic spellbook combo starters. Put them together bc they have basically the same effect(Add 1 Spellbook card from deck) 3. Nadir Servant - It has dogmatika... No surprises here.</li>  	<li>Counter decks: 1.  Zombie World - They can just turn your spellcasters into zombie... Which makes you cannot play. Against it, I recommend just having luck of drawing 2 cards to knightmare, and play normally(And have a bait to Doomking)... 2. Ice Barriers - Yep... I'm not trolling. 1 card in Ice Barriers(Spellbreaker of Ice Barrier, to be exact) can lock all your deck, making that you cannot play. You can use dogmatika engine against it, but without spells it's very hard to pull something out. 3. Altergeist, Traptrix or any trap-based deck - They probably have Imperial Order in main/side deck. Which again, no spells = no playing.</li>  	<li>Side: 1. Basic Handtraps - Since my deck is not maining it, I put in side, in case of something happen. 2. Lightning Storm - Well, it's a spell, it's good. You can replace it with Raigeki or Harpie's Feather Duster. They do the same in a duel. 3. Pots - In Spellbook decks, pots are a good drawing card, but because we are using a Dogmatika engine, I don't recommend it. You could use it and comment if it was good. 4. Solemns - Again, normally mained in Spellbook decks, but I sided it, because of Dogmatika.  You can probably use it if you optimize more this set. 5. Triple Tactical Talents/ Mind Control/ Called by the Grave/ Monster Reborn - Those are cards that you can change to the ones you prefer. They normally never go to main, but can be used against some decks. If you're gonna use Triple Tactical Talents, I recommend only using 1.</li> </ul> I've not played this deck enough to know the decks this deck is strong, but if you can put a good field, you can counter many decks. Sorry if this is not that much of an info, but if I can help, that's enough."

However, before the release of the SD, Ice Barriers lacked field prescence and swarming capabilities that could ease the summon of their Extra Deck monsters or maintain their lockdown effects, since most required another Ice Barrier on the field.  Freezing Chains introduced cards that aid the swarming aspect and a new boss monster and some sort of recycling and protection:  Revealer: Can discard one card to SS an Ice Barrier Tuner from the Deck, but locks on only SS WATER monsters for the turn. If an Ice Barrier monster would require a discard to activate their effects <em>(ej. Revealer, Brionac or Gungnir)</em>, it can banish itself from the GY as one of those cards. Her lockdown effect prevents your opponent to Tribute Summon. <em>(One of the main playmakers)</em>  Speaker: Can SS from the hand if you control an Ice Barrier monster. Also, if you control an Ice Barrier monster, it can banish from the GY to SS a level 1 token. Her lockdown effect prevents Defense Position monsters to change battle position. <em>(Free material for summons)</em>  General Wayne: Can SS from the hand if you control an Ice Barrier monster and your opponent controls a monster. Searchs and Ice Barrier S/T on summon. His lockdown effect doesn't require another Ice Barrier monsters and banishes any S/T sent to your opponent's GY while on the field. <em>(Preffered targets are Medallion or Freezing Chains, their new Spell)</em>  Zuijin: Can SS from the GY by lowering 2 levels from a face-up WATER mosnter on your field, but it banishes if it leaves the field. Can Tribute itself to SS a level 5 or higher Ice Barrier monster from your hand. Doesn't have a lockdown effect. <em>(Can help as tribute or Synchro fodder)</em>  Hexa Spirit: Can mill a level 3 or lower Ice Barrier monster to copy its level for the rest of the turn. Reduces by 500 the ATK/DEF of your opponent's monsters while another Ice Barrier is on the field. <em>(Main Tuner and Revealer's preffered target)</em>  Winds over the Ice Barrier: Can tribute any number of Ice Barrier monsters on the field to SS the same number of level 4 or lower Ice Barrier monsters from the Deck. Can banish from the GY to add a Ice Barrier that is banished or in your GY to your hand. <em>(Deck Summoner and recycler)</em>  Freezing Chains: A Continuous Spell that works as an archetypal World Legacy Guardragon, SS any level 4 or lower Ice Barrier monster from your GY. If you control 3 or more Ice Barrier monsters, all of them are unaffected to your opponent's activated monster effects if they were SS from the Extra Deck. <em>(GY summoner and effect protection)</em>  Terror of Trishula: A Trap card that can copy OG Trishula's effects depending on the number of Ice Barrier Synchro monsters on your field. While on the GY, can banish itself to negate an effect that target any Ice Barrier Synchro monster. <em>(Although requires setup, is fairly strong)</em>  Trishula, Zero Dragon: A generic, level 11, three-material Synchro monster that can banish up to 3 cards on your opponent's field, without targeting. If destroyed by any mean, floats into the OG Trishula from the Extra Deck or GY, makes its ATK 3300, negates the effects of all your opponents monsters currently on his field and halves its attack. <em>(Very powerful boss monster that can punish harder if not removed carefully)</em>  The Side Deck on this list works to show examples of cards that can be used as tech choices, whether they are in the SD or not. Some of them help to add certain lockdown effects depending the matchup or removal (Dai-Sojo, Spellbreaker and Dance Princess), extenders (Deep Sea Diva &amp; Prima Donna, Halqifibrax &amp; Quandax, Coral Anemone, Moray of Greed, Surface and Magellanica) and strong removal or effect negation (Quariongandax, White Aura Whale, Risen Dragite and Fiendish Chain just since can be recycled by Dewloren if not destroyed)"

Leaving 1 Performage Trick Clown can be very hard to take out, and can win if your opponent relied heavily on spell to get combo going and do not have card to out the Village.  &nbsp;  This deck can be change to pure Magistus by adding Magistus Theurgy and removing Super Polymerization then more handtraps.

You've been warned.,"If you been around Youtube, you've probably heard of Cimoooooooo's Yu-Gi-Oh Progression series. I decided to try this out as a deck build exercise. I will be doing the prize wheel, but a little bit different. I will be including Gold Series and Reprint sets alongside the Tournament Packs. Why? Because why not. Also, I will be using the custom wheel from wheel-of-yugioh.com to determine what prize I'll add to the deck. The reason for that is because I can't work out how Cimoooooooo portioned out the prizes for his wheel. If you have any thoughts about my choice of cards, let me know in the comments."

Then I realized that they’re actually really good in some ways.  Treat and Frost provides graveyard utility and fixes the negate problems that the twins have (where they just die to one ash)  Plus frost is an aqua so she can help make toadally awesome and treat is a dark so she can help make number 65. Both negates  So I took a control spin with knightmare for this deck and it works like a charm!

You can summon and lock out your opponent from doing basically everything, You can set up your board on your players turn you will want to make sure you have a Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, Send The Trap card Destruction Swordsman Memories into the grave when activating Prologue and if you didnt draw that, Hopefully you drew a Buster Whelp and use buster whelp to get Prologue. link away Welp for Linkuribo and then chain a dogmatika to the Linkuribo. If you use Nadier Servant or Eclacia send Titinklad The Ash Dragon to the grave then you can trigger Memories in the grave and use the Ash Dragon and a Buster Blader as Fusion material (this will trigger on your opponent's turn) and activate the Trap Prologue and you will summon Buster Dragon and Buster Blader the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman. This will cause all your opponent's monsters to become dragons and the fusion will cause all dragons they own to be switched to defense and cant activate their effects. You can attack with you Fusion Buster Blader to a defence position monster  and inflict piercing damage and if your Fusion Buster didn't attack make The Link, (using buster dragon) protector welp of destruction swordsman. and in the endphase they will take burn damage of the attk of the Dragon Destroyer that didn't attack because it can only attack if theirs a monster on their side of the field. Also use buster welp to search other Dragon Buster cards to equip to a buster blader so your basically able to make your opponent to essentially not be able to even play. And all else fails theirs always Dragoon. if your faced with a dragoon on turn one you can out Dragoon with Fallen of Albaz and use it as a super polly for starving venom fusion dragon."

I won the first week with it. I hope to contribute to some sort of resource for similarly-minded people with this since deckbuilding with almost no playables is... unexpectedly challenging. You struggle to fill in the remaining spots very quickly. I hope to provide a few guidelines and am open for criticism to improve in the future.  The concept of the deck is fairly simple: Sit behind 2k defenders or try to establish a board presence with Witty Phantom, Trial of Nightmare Uraby or Skull Red Bird. Eventually, go into your tributed guys + proper field spell and dominate from there.  Yami and Sogen are of utmost importance for this. Yami lets Trial Of Nightmare go toe-to-toe with Uraby, the second strongest non-tribute beater of the format. Witty Phantom surpasses Skull Red Bird, the strongest beatstick without tribute requirement. My 2k defenders also don't mind the additional def (with the exception of Spirit of the Harp who unfortunately falls into Curse of Dragon range under Yami). Similary, Beaver Warrior is safe from any non-tribute beater under Sogen. Gaia at least trades with Dark Magician with it.  My ""payoffs"" are Two-Pronged attack (going minus two to out a two-tribute monster is surprisingly decent as it re-establishes the advantageous position you previously had just by spamming 2k defenders; the momentum swing from any two-tribute summon is huge), Gaia the Fierce Knight (my best two-tribute guy) and Succubus Knight. I used the last purely because it had incidental synergy with Sogen and my one equip spell. She actually came in clutch in the finals since I established her with the blade and Sogen.  Dark Hole, and Stop Defense are power staples to destroy card advantage from the opponent. Hane-Hane punishes tributes. Swords is pretty nice if you draw any of the monsters not mentioned so far since those are just filler slots that can only secure you the driver's seat with luck.  Mountain is sort of a win more card: It lets Curse of Dragon go over 2k defenders but can snowball negatively if that one falls. Boosting Skull Red Bird is pretty devastating if your deck usually relies on field boosts to withstand it or go over the red menace.  The extra deck is just filler stuff I pulled to trick people into believing I would be stupid enough to run Poly at this stage of the game.  No side deck since even getting to forty cards was enough of a struggle already. Dragon Capture Jar would have been a possible candidate had I pulled it, though.  Things to note: There is no Trap Hole in our format so far, which made tribute summons so much better in theory. Two-pronged attack was, thankfully, largely dismissed by my friends. Don't commit the same mistake in your Prog decks; losing card advantage in favor of board presence isn't that bad if 90% of your cards suck!"

I think its biggest strength over Zoolitch was and is the OTK potential and not necessarily access to ZEXAL . The deck lost the ability to consistently stun/stall with ZEXAL but now has more options and ways to disrupt the opponents plays.

With Lightning Overdrive coming in the near horizon with big Rose Dragon support, I was wondering if there was any way to bring a new type of Dragon Link to the TCG. That is when I created an update version of the Rokket engine that, from playtesting, seems more consistent.  Here is how the easiest combo is played:  White Rose Dragon normal summon, trigger it's effect to special summon a rose dragon from your hand, I like to go with Red Rose Dragon. Link off into Halq, and trigger its effect to special Roxrose Dragon. You should have a spell card that either triggers a special summon from the graveyard, or, use chaos space to summon Wyverburster or Collarserpent. Link Roxrose off into Elpy and Wyver/Collar into Pisty. Trigger Wyver/Collar's effect to get the other one in your hand. Trigger Elpy's effect to special Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Link Elpy, Pisty, and Halq off into Borrelsword. Banish Wyver/Collar to special summon the other to the field. Banish Chaos Space to Draw a card. Trigger Red-Eyes' effect to special summon Red Rose Dragon from the graveyard. Synchro off one of the chaos dragon babies and Red Rose into Black Rose Dragon. Do not trigger BRD's effect. Trigger Red Rose's effect to special Roxrose Dragon and activate it's effect to search a Basal Rose Shoot from your deck. Synchro summon Blood Rose Dragon using Black Rose Dragon and Roxrose Dragon. On that summon, quick-play Basal Rose Shoot to instantly get the Black Rose Dragon back.  Your ending board will be: Borrelsword Dragon, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Blood Rose Dragon, and Black Rose Dragon.  It will all pretty much end up being that ending board, you may just have different routes like Chamber Dragonmaid/White Rose Cloister.  I would be happy to go into more depth if anyone has any questions.  Thanks!  -Al."

That's the closest to meta I'm ever going to get, so I'm going to move on.  More or less this deck is a gimmick-y <em>Odd-Eyes/Performapal/Magician</em> deck, with certain focuses.  <em>Odd-Eyes Dissolver</em> is a key card in summoning heavy-hitters alongside <em>Dragoon</em>, like <em>Rune-Eyes</em> and <em>Vortex Dragon</em>. It also works well to help preserve a board in a pinch. XYZ-wise, the number of Level 7 Monsters in the deck help bring out <em>Absolute Dragon</em>, which is a good Extra Deck beater to help recycle <em>Odd-Eyes</em> Monsters that get popped. The other two XYZ, <em>Ebon Illusionist </em>and <em>Number 67, </em>are more or less for more gimmick-y plays, either using Dark Magician as something more that a material for Dragoon and just rolling dice for grins.  Spells and Traps don't need much explanation because most, if not all, of them center around supporting or summoning <em>Odd-Eyes </em>Monsters or just serving to support the Pendulum-heavy nature of the deck."

This is my first attempt at making a deck.

Tips-  Purple poisons destruction effect can be used to pop monsters if their field  Xiangke and Xiangsheng can get out Odd eyes rebellion dragon to destroy all face up monsters your opponent controls for 1000 lp each and then attack 3 times with 3000 atk  White wing magician with any level 4 will also easily get you out Supreme King Clear Wing, a powerful synchro monster.  Odd eyes fusion can be used on an empty field for odd eyes vortex dragon to send a monster they control to the hand and negate spell/trap effects  Utopia the lightning is always a powerful option to take down opponent boss monsters as well  Also using fusion cards on magicians will help send them to the grave directly  Pendulum call is a great way to discard a magician and add 2 more to your hand  Timestar Magician can search out Chronograph Sorcerer as well as send magicians straight from deck to graveyard"

Does not incorporate the Metalfoes Fusion monsters.,"This build of Unchained is more on the Control side, but it still has the potential to switch into a break your board otk deck if needed to. The inclusion of Metalfoes Vanisher really helps out this deck because it can out monsters that destruction effects can't, as well as having the option to banish a monster from the grave.  So this strategy, as you can see, has all the Unchained good stuff you can expect from the archetype, but now with a small metalfoes package of Silverd, Vanisher, and Counter. With the inclusion of painful decision, this deck gives you a consistent way to pop your unchained cards with the benefit of tutoring out Metalfoes Counter of which can lead to a disruption using Vanisher.  Using Silverd can act as an extender to this deck because if an Unchained monster on board would have their effect negated with impermanence or ash blossom, then you can pop the monster and still be able to play the game.  Also it's important to note that I'm not running any of the Metalfoes Fusion cards mainly because that means you need to have a metalfoes monster on board if you were to run Super-Poly. I'm not leaning too hard into Metalfoes, so there was no reason to put in the whole Super-Poly and Metalfoes Fusion cards package that people expect from Metalfoes.  Lastly, I have 7 handtraps in this deck, not including driver, and using this many handtraps definitely muddies the consistency of the deck, so you can feel free to change up the ratio of handtraps by adding in another Sarama or maybe even the Wailing of the Unchained if you wish to run that card.  This is my first time uploading a deck and this build is probably going to change over time, but I think it's a decent build right now. Thanks for reading."

Here's a redo, i guess. Shame people are buying out Prankids cards; i'd love to build them IRL. How's the wife? Note that I talk about all the Prankkids without mentioning their conditions for their summoning effs. so count in the condition that they have to be sent to the grave for a fusion or link summon of a Prank kid monster first if you read this. you probably wont. wait, who are you? oh god, i thought i already paid my rent this month.  3x Rocksies- Rocksies is one of the usual combo pieces for Prankids, as all the children are. Rocksies is a nice card for garnering advantange, as it allows you to plus 1 i'm pretty sure, with drawing you one and specialling a Prankkid from deck at the cost of banishing a card. Why is he made of rocks? What's happened to him? 3x Lampsies- Lampsies is underwhelming- it goes hand neutral, as the most it does is burn the opponent for an unimportant amount of damage and get some bodies on board. He looks like he's in intense pain from that fire. Someone please put him out. 3x Dropsies- the aftermath of a failed waterboarding, Dropsies LP gaining is worthless and does nothing for the deck. Like the rest, it SS's from deck for field presence. 3x Fansies- Fansies is really nice for setting up the grave for extended plays, and also, as can be assumed, gets more bodies on board from deck. God, i'm going to deck out at this rate. Also, Fansies looks like his body is falling apart and he's panicking. Somebody help him. 3x Aleister- Aleister is a favorite card of mine- he has really cool lore, both in and outside of the yu gi oh universe. Anyway, Aleister is the deck's main normal summon if you open him, as he gets you to Invocation to most likely go into Mechaba. Just play Mechaba. 3x Ash- Chain Ash Chain Gamma Chain Gamma Chain TTT Chain Solemn Strike Chain Solemn Judgement Call a judge 3x Ghost Belle- cries in lunalight 3x Pranks- Pranks really helps with getting bodies on board for plays, as Pranks loads up your grave and gives you a token for that advantage as well, which is very appreciated. It's second effect is an archetypal Jar of Avarice for prank kids,  allowing you to recycle resources during the end phase and get advantage for turn 2. 3x Place- Place is a pretty average field spell, as on activation, it's a ROTA for the deck, which is, you know. Really fucking good. It also gives you a pretty unimportant attack boost when you fusion summon a Prankids fusion, which isn't important and not very useful. It has a ""yin"" effect, where if you link summon a Prankids, all monsters your opponent controls loses 500- in a going first deck. 2x Pandemonium- Pandemonium is the archetypal fusion spell, and, at first glance, is pretty great. The main problem is that it locks you into Prankids for the rest of the turn after you activate it, which is a pain in the ass. Due to that, I run it it at 2- some people run it at 1, and utter fucking imbeciles play it at 3. It's a quick play, so you can set it for interruption, which is nice. 2x Invocation- Normal summon Aleister Declare Aleister Tops YCS 1x Terraforming- Terraforming is a nice tool for consistency, as if you've already opened Place, you can use it to search Recycing PLant (which i'll get into in a bit), and vica versa, etc. It's a nice tool for consistency and does it's job well for getting your ROTAs to hand. 1x Instant Fusion- Instant Fusion is a great play starter, as it gets out a lower leveled Prank Kids fusion for free, getting bodies on board to start plays. You can also use it to summon Raidjin when goign second, to help with breaking boards and forcing out negates. 2x Fusion Recycling Plant- I said we'd get to it. Plant's generally a nice card for getting Poly to your hand, as Poly is th eother fusion spell to avoid using Pandomnium, due to Pandomenium's restrictions. Recycling Plant also helps with, well, reyccling fusion material monsters to extend your plays and set up plays for turn 2. 2x poly- oh god 3x Desires- banish Invocation, Instant, Terra, and all the prankids smile 2x Battle Butler- Battle Butler is a quick play Raigeki that, at first sight, leaves you with only a Mechaba  (on the ideal board). Using Meow Meow Mu (which i'll get into later), Butler doesn't even tribute itself, meaning you can have multiple large bodies on board and quick play Raigeki the opponent for barely any cost. It also just, gets bodies back on board hwen it dies, although it probably won't be dying. 1x Rocket Ride- Instant fusion go brrrrrr Rocket Ride is mainly used for extending plays, as you can sack it off to summon two prankids from your grave, turning 1 monster into two. That's, y'know, really good. 1x Weather Washer- I play this purely to fuck over that one guy at my locals who mains Mirror Force in every god damn deck he plays Fuck you Dillan 1x Augo- Prob won't be summonig this lol. It's just nice for clearing boards and doing funny shit. 1x Mechaba- The invoked monster you will be summoning, Mechaba is a nice negation monster. it loads up your grave for later, and negate's the opponent's combo pieces, as long as you know what you're doing. 1x Raidjin- Book of Moon on legs is pretty nice. 1x Caliga- Floodgate go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 1x Rooster- Similar to Butler, Rooster is a quick play Harpie's Duster, by tributing itself. Using Meow Mu, you can avoid the tributing itself, allowing you to fucking wreck backrow decks for little to no cost. On death, it recycles non-link monsters from grave back to the hand for other plays. 1x Bark- Bark allows you to recur resources at the same time as giving your Prankids protection during the opponent's turn, all of which is really nice on a quick effect. He also gives a small and unimportant damage boost. 1x Doodle Doo- Doodle Doo allows you to search Prank Kids S/T, giving you access to Place and such, extending your plays greatly. Additionally, it allows you to tribute itself to bounce Prankids back to your hand, although this eff isnt a quick effect. 2x Meow Meow Mu- Meow Meow is an integral card to the deck, due to it's GY effect. Whenever a Prank Kids would tribute itself for an effect, you could banish Meow Meow instead, allowing you to keep your board in tact and still blow up the opponent's. Meow Meow is an amazing link-1 for the deck you want to bump to the grave as soon as possible. 1x Artemis- Artemis is just a link-1 for Aleister, as you link off Aleister into Artemis for an instant Mechaba after normal summoning Aleister.  Generally, thi sis a pretty fun and powerful going first combo deck, with a high cieling. Also update the fucking meta deck tag site owner, this is a meta deck"

Its all of the cards of the archetype ran in 2's and 3's, as well as a few extras. The basic gameplay loop is pretty simple. You want as wide as pendulum scale as you can set up, and then you take advantage of the archetypes resilience against effects and traps to push forward and win quickly with high 2000+ power monsters. &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Main Deck Monsters:</strong>  Each of these cards has a purpose besides their ATK and DEF.  <span><strong>Coeuria:</strong> Helps keep monster effects under control. Be aware when using her Quick Effect that she can kill monsters that activate effects, but not negate them. </span>  <span><strong>Beautea: </strong>Has a Quick Effect that makes things get banished instead of hitting the graveyard. This ranges from great to useless, as you can use it to take out annoying that don't stay in the graveyard. <strong>Her second ability</strong> lets her kill a monster at the beginning of the damage step if its ATK is higher than or equal to the lowest pendulum scale x300. (So usually between 300 - 900.) So use her vs 3000+ monsters, and let someone else kill the small stuff. </span>  <span><strong>Angelea:</strong> Use this card to smooth out your board and fish for certain effects. By tributing a ""michord"" monster, you can search out another one with a pendulum scale 2 higher or lower than what you tributed. So for example, this lets you take an 1100 ATK Elitea who has bounced a spell or trap, and turn her into a Cutea for adding a monster to hand and buffing your field, or into a Gracea with 2100 ATK that can add a spell/trap to hand.  <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, as it prevents trap/spell activation during the battle phase until <strong>after </strong>the damage step as long as you have an odd pendulum scale. </span>  <span><strong>Gracea</strong>: Adds a ""michord"" spell or trap to the hand, so we don't need terraforming or metaverse in most matches. Target Harmonia if its not out. Target Musica if you need the special summon/destruction, target Elegance/Scale to fix your pendulum scales. <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, as it prevents trap/spell activation during the battle phase until <strong>after </strong>the damage step as long as you have an even pendulum scale. </span>  <span><strong>Fancea:</strong> Moves a ""michord"" monster from the deck to the Extra Deck. This is better than it sounds, because of so many abilities that key off manipulating monsters there. <strong>Her second ability </strong>is useful but easily played around. It allows her to be destroyed instead of another ""michord"" during battle. </span>  <span><strong>Elitea: </strong>Bounces a spell/trap when she's summoned. She also prevents battle damage while you have an even scale, so don't be afraid to drop her face up ATK for her effect. </span>  <span><strong>Dreamea: </strong>Can be special summoned if you have a pendulum ""michord"" out.  If a ""michord"" dies from a card effect, she can take its place. </span>  <span><strong>Cutea: </strong>Fishes a ""michord"" monster to your hand when summoned, so she helps regulate pendulum scales. <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, giving a buff = to pendulum scale to your ""michord"" monsters. </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <hr />  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells and Traps: </strong>  A lot of gameplay is centered around the field spell, as well as the deck searches and pendulum fixes.  <strong>Doremichord Elegance:</strong> Its used to either set up your pendulum scales or draw cards. Don't be afraid to use it to draw cards late game. If you have Doremichord Harmony in play, you can rebuild them easily by using Harmony to add one high or low girl back to the hand, and then reactivate your scales assuming you have at least 1 other usable 'michord' in hand, or Pendulum shift and a suitable target.  <strong>Doremichord Scale:</strong> This card struggles to be useful, but I've kept it because this is a fun deck and I wanted the whole archetype. They are the first things I sideboard out in most cases. It DOES help fix your pendulums if they get screwy, but the 5+ and 7+ are rarely going to happen.  <strong>Doremichord Harmonia:</strong> This is the most important spell, as it does so much for your board. <strong>First,</strong> it gives you your level 1 'michord"" monster back to summon from hand for a free deck add. (Or any other 'michord' you would rather normal summon.) <strong>Second, </strong>it allows you to fix your scales by raising one pendulum to rank 9. This is important for your card effects that proc off of even, odd, or pendulum scales of each. <strong>Third, </strong>as long as you have 3 or more ""michords"" all odd or even, you can destroy a card the other guy has.  These effects can be used in any order, so its entirely possible to to add an odd scaled card to hand, activate it to the pendulum zone, make the other scale a 9, then use the ability to destroy a card. Even better, they are independent activations which means you can eat a negate and still have some of the effects left.  <strong>Pendulum XYZ:</strong> This deck is really good for this card, because each cards scale + level = 9. This means that you'll usually have at least a level 6-9 monster in a given zone. This makes it super easy to summon a big XYZ baddie out of the deck. I picked ones I liked for anti spell/effects/ATK power, but I'm sure there's more competitive options. This card is nice to use if you have an otherwise bricky Doremichord Elegance in hand. Just use this, then activate Elegance and rebuild.  <strong>Doremichord Musica:</strong> It either helps special summon monsters or destroys an opponents card.  <strong>Doremichord Formal:</strong> Protects your pendulum monsters AND your pendulum zones. Make sure you have a face-up monsters in the extra deck to use this. It doesn't actually negate anything, but on the bright side it does respond to spells/traps AND monster effects.  <strong>Pendulum Switch:</strong> Moves cards between being monsters or spells. This is useful when you need them to be one or the other, or when pushing for final damage by turning your low scales (your highest ATK) into monsters again.  <strong>Sanctuary of Parshath:</strong> Odd one off pick, but it gets some of your fairies over the 3k barrier while also protecting traps and allowing to you recycle fairies from the grave after they were used for XYZ stuff or put there by the other player.  <strong>Raigeki/Harpy/Solemn Judgement:</strong> These are all strong one off cards.  Some people don't like these, so by all means you can switch them out.  <hr />  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck: </strong>  These cards are mostly all utility. Change to suit your own tastes.  <strong>Elemental Charmers: </strong>This deck uses all 4 elemental attributes, so putting one of each adds options to both increase pendulum summons and maybe take something good from the graveyard.  <strong>Linkuriboh: </strong>Summon Cutea, search a card, then if her attack buff isn't needed, turn her into a Linkuriboh to soak damage and put Cutea back in your face-up extra pile.  <strong>Celestial Knightlord Parshath:</strong> Use him to fish out Sanctuary of Parsath or a fairy monster from the deck. Also, he's got a GY function to banish a fairy to summon a fairy.  <strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:</strong> Summoning him puts a stock of 3 pendulum monsters face-up in your extra deck. He can also destroy cards to add other cards back to your hand, as well as granting you cards when your pendulum zones are cleared. Without support, he's going to get ran over at only 1800 atk power, so make sure you get the most out of his abilities.  <strong>Zefra Metaltron:</strong> Also helps get pendulum monsters back out of the GY in addition to helping control the opponents board and reset nerfed cards.  <strong>Number 89:</strong> Good ATK and able to banish a card from your opponents extra deck.  <strong>Number 24:</strong> Decent control card and okay ATK.  <strong>Spriggun Ship Exblower:</strong> Good defense and able to clear a mix of monsters/backrow.  <strong>Number 11:</strong> Good ATK. Yoinks a monster permanently.  <strong>Number 76:</strong> Good ATK. At formation its going to be battle-immune to two elements, and you can add elements to this number. Also, she has a keyboard sword for lolz.  <strong>Dark Anthelion Dragon:</strong> Strong ATK. Also has some recursion abilities after it dies, and is a useful pendulum that halves enemy ATK.  <strong>Number 38:</strong> Strong ATK, and can negate spell effects.  <hr />  <strong>Sideboard: </strong>  Cards to help against certain types of situations.  <strong>Beutea, Dreamea and Elitea:</strong>  1 more of each of these in case you are playing card effect or recursion heavy enemies. Swap out a Coeuria or a Fancea to make room.  <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>: I put this in the side to add in if someone is playing a deck that hinges on combo searches.  <strong>Pendulum Halt:</strong> If I find myself constantly losing battles or with a ton of dead 'michords', I side this in and remove Scale.  <strong>Typhoon:</strong> I put this card in against Spell Mining Cave or Floodgate decks.  <strong>Mask of Restrict</strong>: Helps stop Monarchs and Kaiju, as well as a number of other effects.  <strong>Pendulum Reborn</strong>: If someone is milling my fairies to the graveyard, this helps get them back.  &nbsp;  <hr />  Final Thoughts:  This deck is probably a B tier deck all said and done. It has some neat tricks, but against someone who is trying to negate your summons, its all wasted. Its fun to play and can usually recover from a board wipe mid game with enough assets in hand. Its hard to get scale-bricked, unless you only draw low scales, but there's a few fixer cards in place to help with that. And even if you do say, draw nothing but Level 8, Scale 1 cards, you can just Pendulum XYZ them into something useful to help get yourself back on top.  Decks that banish will give this trouble, like any bad pendulum matchup. Decks that rely on traps and backrow should be a favorable game. It has a few strange things I've done, and things that can be improved I'm sure, but that's probably because I'm a filthy casual and don't know everything there is to know about the Yugi meta."

This deck uses Abyss Actors as a chain of Pendulum Summons for Monsters such as <em>Evil Heel </em>through support like <em>Apprentice Piper </em>and <em>Trendy Understudy</em> and with the help of Link Monsters like <em>Hyper Director </em>and <em>Proxy Dragon</em>. The deck also includes good scales in the form of <em>Leading Lady </em>and <em>Twinkle Star</em> to summon lower-level <em>Abyss Actors</em> using the same Link support, and additional scale support in a pinch like <em>Curtain Raiser</em>. Naturally too, the <em>Abyss Script</em> Spells and <em>Abyss Actor</em> Traps are meant to keep the momentum on Monster plays going. Alongside direct support, <em>Ghost Ogre</em>, <em>Solemn Strike</em> and <em>Impermanence </em>are used to slow down opponent counters and negates to the Summons required for this deck.  With the Special Summons provided by the above mentioned, the end-goal is to summon <em>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</em>, and through that summon the heavy-hitter and backrow manager, <em>Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destoryer</em>.

The primary deck engine depends on Nekroz, while the secondary Drytron engine offers great synergy and support. In addition, this deck can also consistently make <span><strong>Vanity's Ruler</strong> lockdown</span> plays and Nekroz of Areadbhair serves as an extra support negation to interrupt plays (such as Eldlich, Shaddolls, Burning Abyss...etc).</span>  <span><span>Diviner of the Heralds</span> is an outstanding one card combo - both to start the engine, and for mid-to-late game grinding. The Drytron engine offers amazing recycling and grinding game, and most importantly, allos extra ritual summons while <span><strong>Meteonis Drytron</strong></span> is a generic ritual spell that can also revive ritual monsters from the grave (like <span><strong>Nekroz Cycle</strong></span>). Diviner of the Heralds's versatile play consists on dumping <span><strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong></span> (for universal ritual card search), while also allowing plays dumping <span><strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong></span> to destroy one essential card on the enemy side of the field (such as floodgates or lockdowns) without needing to special summon or accessing the extra deck. Personally, both effects of Diviner of the Heralds makes it the perfect substitution for Manju, while offering many outplay potential for both first and second turn plays. </span>  <span><span>Nekroz of Areadbhair</span> is the new big monster for the Nekroz archetype - easily accessible, helps unbrick Nekroz hands, can be search through <span><strong>Herald of Arc Light</strong></span> (Any Ritual Monster/Spell), <span><strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong></span> (Any Ritual Monster/Spell), <strong><span>Nekroz of Brionac</span> </strong>(Nekroz Monster), <strong><span>Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</span> </strong>(Warrior Nekroz Ritual) and <strong><span>Drytron Alpha Thuban</span> </strong>(Ritual Monster). The strongest part about Nekroz of Areadbhair are optional plays to tribute from ""hand or field"" which can trigger tribute effect monsters such as Shurit and Diviner, while also ""banishing the negated monster"" (does not limit to monster effect activated in hand/field/grave). Meanwhile, the deck has passive counter towards extra deck monsters such as <span><strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong></span> (Extra Deck monster Skill Drain) and <span><strong>Nekroz of Clausolas</strong></span> (Spell Speed 2 negation and ATK reduction to 0). The main card to establish a lead gameplay is summoning and resolving <span><strong>Nekroz of Trishula</strong></span> (Banish 1 Hand / 1 Field / 1 Grave) as it offers minimum a net +2 advantage that can inherently banish essential card on enemy side of the field without targeting.</span>  <span>My <span>all time favorite Nekroz play</span> (going second to break </span><span>board) is starting the turn and entering battle phase directly with nothing on board to shock enemy with <span><strong>Evenly Matched</strong></span> (banish all enemy field and leaving one card on the field), and then following up with a Nekroz of Trishula play to wipe the last card on the enemy board completely while banishing one extra card in the enemy hand. Resolving both effects in the same turn would leave your enemy devastated and force them to scoop immediately. Unfortunately, most decks will have some kind of front row or backrow with spell/trap negation, so the chances of making this power play is extremely difficult. However, this play is significantly easy to make against decks like Eldlich, Burning abyss, Shaddoll...etc.</span>  <span>Overall, I strongly believe Nekroz still remains a strong and competitive deck for 2021. There are many alternative Nekroz builds viable for the meta such as: <span>Deskbot build</span> (vulnerable to handtrap as it relies on a one card combo),  <span>Impcantation build</span>  (slow but consistent) and <span>Dogmatik build</span> (low risk low reward, but consistent).</span>  &nbsp;  If you have any suggestions to improve the deck, please comment down below."

One well planned attack can clutch victory.,"Banish like crazy. Send your opponent's cards to the banishment zone with Macro Cosmos and dimensional fissure to prevent graveyard play. Limit extra deck summons with traps. High LP  gained from banishing gives you extra time. 8 star dragravion XYZ options. Post Union Carrier ban, so no Dragon/Wizard Buster Destruction Swords for Mystic Mine. NecroFace recycles deck to prevent deck out. Try to Golden Sarcophagus it ASAP. Use Glife to get Golden Castle to summon Hexe Trude and banish 8 for Gizmek for Number Dragons or XYZ of choice. Other pieces of the Fairytale set can be included to protect the castle. Super poly is necessary for Mudragon. It protects your monster/s that are going for the finish. Offense is the main strategy, and defense is good. Has control capabilities . Recovery from disruption is a little difficult, but not impossible with the raw draw power of this deck. This deck has many variations and can beat many of the newer decks if played well. Side deck is for a few extra strategies for a paradigm change, but feel free to find some cards to include to dismantle a major enemy. Does surprisingly well given that this deck is a mash up of stuff that centers on banishing and it does have synergy despite not being an Archetype deck."

During the opponent's turn, Shadow Lich generates a token off a Quick Effect, which you can then use Masquerena's Quick Effect to go into a Link 4, which in this Extra Deck is either Knightmare Gryphon or Linkmail Archfiend, depending on the rest of your board state. With Linkmail, any of your other Extra Deck Monsters are protected from monster effects. Gryphon would potentially lock your opponent out of activating effects unless they can Link with Gryphon.  The rest of the deck is pretty straightforward in terms of its combos. D/D/D strongly excels at negating spell/trap effects, and the rest of the extra deck is designed to assist in monster negates."

Combine it with Macro Cosmos and your opponents GY plays get foiled, while you just SS your Monsters via Escape from the Dark Dimension.  -Gizmek Orochi provides a durable Dark Machine and Rank 8 for XYZ Summons.  -Metal Reflect Slime helps with easier Rank 10 XYZ's and Cyber Stein can throw out an unexpected hurdle for the opponent. If they have a trap/spell heavy deck, just use Natura Exterio to lock them down, if they have a face up Monster, Summon Super Vehicroid 2 times and go into Rank 10 XYZ combined with a Super dreadnought Liebe finish.

Put alternative on the board and link into halqi ...and pray your opponents dont have interruptions  Incase of interruptions we still have Triple tactics talents and called by the grave, but if all goes good halq summons another egg - egg into an Elpy special Levianeer by banishing 3 lights but leave 1 stone of legends to special summon to make pisty. Special summon your single copy of Starliege Seyfert - then go into Saryuja and hopefully fix your hand to advance plays into your preferable plays. Nebula is a sweet tech card that can unbrick your hand into an immediate number 97: Draglubion  2)the white stone of legends is searchable so you can play only 2 of it + There is a good amount of level 8s in the deck, so i choose to play 3 trade-in +  2 cards of consonance(for stones of ancients ideally) - TTT can help you avoid nibiru + upstart slims your deck  3)Chaos emperor is also a level 8 that can recover from the banished and can summon itself from the extra deck by banishing a light and a dark  4)Ash and called by the grave is a must. Dragon shrine and return of the dragon lords are outdated cards so i advice to not play them  Optional cards:  -Deep-eyes is probably holding this deck back ...but you play many dragons and the burn is quite hilarious if it goes through  -Skill drain, most of your monsters are THICC in stats  - Lancea and nibiru are sided because it can be dead against certain decks  -Goliath is also a level 8 dragon that locks your opponent from the extra deck  Going second cards:  Dark ruler no more  Harpies duster  .............................................................................  Conclusion:  My first guide go easy on me, i prefer dark magician over blue-eyes cause its requires less IQ and dragoon just carries you to the win  But this deck is quite solid in my opinion most of it is based on the deck list i saw teamsamuraiX1 did on youtube, but i modified to how i play it.

Because I wanted to include the Infinitrack Megaclops, I threw in a Numeron Engine to get it out for free if you have no board (Activate Numeron Wall, Summon Field Spell, Summon the 3 Gate XYZ's and then Megaclops).  The stickiness of Machina Citadell and Fortress gives you good survivability and your beefy XYZ finisher should get the job done. Due to having 3 different Rank 10 XYZ options, the deck is flexible enough to assess any threat.  If you have improvements or ideas, I would be happy to read upon them in the comments."

But really low key, dark magicians are actually not bad ever since soul servant and magicians' soul got printed. They have a decent fusion also that draws an extra card every turn.  Also bond between teacher and student into dark burning magic is crazy fun even thou it is kinda slow."

The main idea of this deck is to get to your Fusion Ancient Gears as soon as possible, while keeping the board under control via a machina engine and big XYZ's Monsters. I included only on AG Fusion, as it is my deck irl, so if you want play 2 or maybe 3 to get easier fusions.  -The machina engine is very basic if you draw the machina spell you can get a free machina fortress protected by a citadel and thin your deck by 2 cards.  -Derricrane and the Bullet Train help with the XYZ Rank 10 Summons, its especially easy if you combine them with Flying Pegasus.  -Galaxy Cyclone is used to pop your own Geartown to get what you need for your Fusions.  -You can also use AG Ballista if your opponent has a field up Monster. Then you can pop Geartown and destroy cards in one.  -Using AG Hydra you should search for Gearbox and then Gearframe to get AG Monsters on hand for fusion summon.  If you have any improvements or ideas, just write in the comments I would love to hear feedback."

To start off, this is a very difficult deck to pilot because if the main combo doesn't go off, then there are back ups, but it's very hand dependent and depends where you are in the combo.  This deck has 12 two-card starters that all require your normal summon. These are Gozuki, Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, and Plaguespreader.  All of these require you to have either Vendread Slayer or Vendread Evolution in your hand  *There are a lot of ways to get Slayer through pre-prep and preparation of rites.  NOTE: I just thought of this now, you could use Vendread Nights to find Slayer easier, but I haven't tested it yet because I forgot that card existed and I'm too far into typing this to stop now. If you do want to include Nights, I recommend taking out the Drytron Cards since they're more of a ""if you draw it then it's nice"" kind of situation.  <hr />  <span>COMBO</span>  Gozuki: Normal Gozuki send Plaguespreader&gt; Plaguespreader Summon&gt; Halq Combo  Uni-Zombie: Normal Uni-Zombie&gt; Send Striges&gt;Striges Effect to Special Summon itself&gt; Halq Combo  Solitaire: Normal Solitaire&gt; Tribute Solitaire for Uni-Zombie&gt; Uni-Zombie effect send Striges or Mezuki&gt; Summon back whichever monster&gt; Halq Combo  *If Solitaire gets negated, you have the option of linking into Almiraj and extending  Plaguespreader: Normal Plaguespreader&gt; Link into Almiraj&gt; Special Summon back Plaguespreader&gt; Halq Combo  Halq Combo: Link into Halq&gt; Summon Deskbot 001&gt; Link into Auroradon&gt; Special Summon tokens&gt; trigger 001 special summon&gt;  Destroy 1 Token and Auroradon to Special Summon Warbluran&gt; Synchro 001 and token into a Herald of the Arch Light&gt; Use Warbluran effect to Tribute Token to raise its level by 1&gt;Synchro into Coral Dragon&gt;Herald effect add Vendread Evolution or Vendread Slayer&gt; Activate Evolution by sending 1 Slayer from deck&gt;  Special Summon Slayer&gt; Synchro into Ultimaya Tzolkin&gt;CL 1 Slayer eff, then CL 2 Coral Dragon effect to chain block&gt; Draw a card off of Coral Dragon&gt;  Search Revendread Origin and send Vendread Anima, Houndhorde, or Striges NOTE: if you have another Vendread card in hand you don't need at this point, then send houndhorde so you can summon him back and get his Spell/Trap Banishing eff.&gt; SET Revendread Origin&gt; Trigger Tzolkin to summon out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon&gt; Activate Origin and banish slayer from grave&gt; Special Summon other Slayer.  This is the End of the Combo and if you have Ecclesia or Nadir Servant, then use those effects at the end and do the Dogmatika Combo Stuff&gt;  The Following Turn: Basically try to set up lethal using what you have left on board.  When Slayer eventually hits the grave&gt; Search Evolution and Send Battlelord&gt; Use Evolution to send another Battlelord from deck&gt; Special Battlelord&gt; use his Shockmaster esque effect to stop activations and effects depending on what you need.  <span>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION:</span> So you're probably wondering why I have Chtugua, Gallant Granite, and Abyss Dweller in the Side deck. Basically this is your 2'nd game contingency plan against combo and break your board decks. What you do is that when you get to the Auroradon Stage, you have Warbluran, 2 tokens, and a 001  Synchro Summon Herald using 001 and a token&gt;Synchro Summon Cthugua using Warbluran and a token&gt;Xyz into Gallant Granite or Abyss Dweller.  You get a free draw from Cthugua and when you detach Material, you detach Herald so that you get a search for Slayer or a Ritual Spell.  Gallant Granite gets Nibiru or Abyss Dweller locks the grave from your opponent.  NOTE: Replace Tzolkin, Crystal Wing, and Coral Dragon, since you won't be using them. I include both gallant granite and Abyss dweller when I Side deck mainly just for the off chance I draw Nibiru.  Vendreads can easily setup again through link climbing and using Battlelord to stop activations and effects of a type in order to assure you otk.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This is the part where It depends on what you have because Vendreads are very good at link climbing, so you can link away Slayer with Tzolkin or other cards to make a Verte Anaconda and using the Slayer effect to grab a ritual spell and send Striges or Houndhorde. From here, you can Special Summon back the Striges or Houndhorde&gt; Ritual Summon Slayer again&gt; Link into I:P Masquerena&gt; Verte Anaconda eff Sending Red-Eyes Fusion&gt; Send Dark Magician and Black Dragon&gt; Summon Dragoon&gt; Use I:P Masquerena with Anaconda to make a destruction protected Avramax on your opponents turn if you don't get lethal.  Link climbing in this deck is the back-up I was talking about at the start. If your opponent doesn't let you get to Halq, then at the very least try to get a Dragoon on board.  <span>IMPORTANT NOTES</span>: To get to Dragoon Easily all you need to do is Normal a Striges or Houndhorde, then use their effects to be summoned back.  Foolish is an extender by pitching any recursive Zombie and it can Send Revendread Slayer if you need it.  Revendread Origin is NOT Once per turn, so you should abuse this card if you get the opportunity.  Vendread Anima LOCKS you into Zombies if you use its Grave effect for the rest of the turn.  The Drytron package is an assurance for your Ritual Summons since they can't be negated with the Field Spell. The Field spell can grab Meteor Shower or Asterism. Asterism is used for going second and Meteor Shower is for going first(Most of the time).  If you don't get the combo and you can't link climb, then use the Dogmatika Engine to get Maximus, so that you can send a Herald and a Titaniklad to set up ritual and Dogmatika plays. If you're going second, then you should be sending N'tiss so you can start breaking your opponents board.  Drawing Battlelord for your opening hand can be amazing because you have the possibility of protecting your link climbing from hand traps with his effect.  Vendread Revenants comes up very rarely as a useful monster, but if does come up where you have option of using Revenants Ritual Summon material effect to banish Special Summoned monsters at quick effect speed. If this monster had a better way of recurring itself from the graveyard, this would be such a good card. The easiest way to set this up is to banish Revenants from the grave, then using anima to special summon it back. This rarely happens though.  Side decking for this deck is easy for me because I take out the 5 Drytron Cards + Terraforming in order to fit 6 side deck cards. Those are the easy choices for side decking, but you can also side deck out 1 houndhorde, striges, and anima if you want more of a chance to draw a hand trap or equalizer.  <span>FINAL WORDS</span>  Well first of all thank you for reading this far and being interested in this abomination I call a viable deck. I have always loved vendreads and I simply cannot let the archetype die.  I'm by no means a competitor, but I do know a lot about the game and I really enjoy making ""terrible decks"" just a little more viable.  I can't wait to run this deck when locals come back and also when Dogmatika Cards stop being so goddamn expensive.  On that note, for the love of god if you can't afford Forbidden Droplet, please don't hesitate to switch it out for an ash blossom or whatever you prefer.  I honestly can't believe it's that expensive.  Anyways, again thank you for reading."

Very. Bad. My spicy techs consisted of Lappis Dragon and a singular Effect Veiler. Also my backrow removal was Mystical Space Typhoon. But let's be real, who could blame me? After all, they had just received some new shiny print. Obviously this was not an ideal deck and heavily restricted by my finances and the cards I had available. Although building a proper deck from the start instead of buying 20 more cards after realising this deck was bad would've probably saved me a nickel back.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Someday I'll take the old deck and burn it to the ground, but until I can afford to literally burn my money, I'll just use this afternoon to build a better deck.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">The starter gotta be somebody and in this case it is Marincess Blue Tang. She's a rockstar. She's the lovechild of Salamangreat Foxy and Gazelle. Wherever she goes Marincess Sea Horse won't be far away. Tang sends Horse and that's enough to climb all the way into your link-4. Altough is it yet lacking it's protection.</span>  &nbsp;  <span lang=""EN-US"">""What protection?""</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">you might ask. If everyone cared and in case nobody knows what the Marincess archetype actually does let me give you a quick explanation of what the deck intends to do. It intends to build a tower, like a really tall one, just shy of God having to intervene. Your field spell makes any link monster in your EMZ that used Marincess Crystal Heart as material unaffected by your opponents card effects. Oh and your Marincess link monster in the EMZ will receive an ATK boost of up to 2000. </span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">So, you have an unaffected 5200 ATK beatstick on the board, you're feelin' way too damn good about yourself, as if you're flying like a satellite a million miles an hour. But then it hit's you. This isn't too bad but you've ended on a board that has no interaction. All your opponent has to do is remove one measly field spell. They've figured you out! You think there's no savin' me now and with shakin' hand your're going through your remaining cards until you stumble upon one very interesting trap card in your hand. Marincess Wave.</span>  &nbsp;  <span lang=""EN-US"">Marincess Wave.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">The heart and soul of your deck (well besides the other good cards). If you control a link-3 or higher Marincess monster it serves as a handtrap that is both Infinite Impermanence and Miscellaneosaurus combined. Pair that with handtraps, TT (searched off of Fury to protect your monsters) and Dinomiscus and you're having yourself a genuinely decent board. How do we get to Wave? We go diggin like Animals. Marincess Heatsoul Great Bubble Reef draws you a card every Standby Phase and Tang excavated 3 cards and if they're still buried too deep in your deck Phantazmey can help you get 'em up.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>""Where there's water a flood will soon follow."" - Me.</span>  Looking at a photograph of Marincesses one might think they'd be fishes. After all that's what they're named after (besides Great Bubble Reef. What is she, like, their home?) but in actuality they are all cyberse. Meaning you can access Accesscode under Rivalry. Rivalry, while disabling your frog engine, still allows you to use any of your link monsters and while Gozen Match might permit the usage of your Code Talkers, you still have Toadally Awesome and the Marincess Towers going for you. Fact ist, if you can play through your floodgates better than your opponent it will usually work out in the end.  &nbsp;  <span>""So many two-of's. Do you wanna see them, like, sometimes but not all the time?""</span>  Oh how you remind me of my younger self, always eager to ask questions. I'm trying not to love you but you're really make writing these so much easier for me. You'll be drawing a lot of cards during your opponent's turn, making cards that activate in hand very powerful. That's why Trap Trick is only on one copy, as it only has 2 targets, one of which can activate in hand. I rather see more handtraps (including traps in hand) than drawing into a trap trick during my opponents turn. Drawing extender's is fine too, since they're helping you play through interaction during your turn. I found Silent Angler - Marincess Mandarin to be better at 2-1 than at 1-2 since one is millable and the other has an easier summoning condition anyways. But you only wanna see it sometimes yknow. Dinomiscus technically is at 3 with trap trick, I just want the 3rd Dinomiscus to be more flexible and turn into Wave on command. TT is not a Trap Trick target since it's most wanted from Fury of Kairyu-Shin. There again I found 2-1 to be the optimal ratios as the extra Furies don't do much in hand and there aren't to many cards that discard.  &nbsp;  <span>Diversity</span>  Didn't know where to put this but on a more serious note, Marincesses are actually very adaptable. If you already have access to wave you can end on Marincess Marbled Rock to recycle your cards during your turns. Also the recursion from Marincess Coral Anemone and Marbled Rock means that one singular Marincess starter can be added back twice allowing for two discards for full Swap engine at no additional costs for discard.  &nbsp;  <span>Anypoop</span> that's it for the decklist. <span lang=""EN-US"">Never again but I made like 21 Nickelback references in here.</span>"

Although I have most of its cards, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> is VERY expensive, hence why I don't run it.  Before I explain the strategy, let me tell the history of this deck: <div>  This is my most stable and powerful deck, however, it's a little old, as the last time I really hunkered down to improve it, there were no Nibiru, Zeus or Dragoons around. Thank COVID for that. And, according do MBT, I can upload my decks in here in order to seek advice, so that's what I'm doing.  Now, I'm an old-school player that skipped ""those wacky black and white cards"", and, just as I was getting used to Pendulums (Igknights best deck, let's GOOOOO), Links dropped and made me completely lost. And since I was buying a lot of cards, and VRAINS is a really cool anime, I tried making a Playmaker deck. The first time I managed to make a Decode Talker on a single turn was soooo exciting...... until it got Kaiju'd.  Then I found about <a data-name=""Cyberse Magician"">Cyberse Magician</a> lock, how Cyberse Clock and Quantum Dragons are able to do that lock similarly, how Transcode and Excode Talkers open up zones for them (back when this was a thing, in MR4) and finally, I got to a point where my deck can consistently setup Transcode and Excode protected by Masquerena on turn 1....... Until I got Nibiru'd. So now my deck is trash again, and I really wanna know how to make it playable again.  </div> Okay, now for the ACTUAL strategy:  My focus is making a board where most of my monsters are protected, and Excode Talker works wonders for that. The winning formula of this deck consists in having a Transcode Talker on the Extra Monster Zone, pointing to a Excode Talker, that protects it from destruction (and can be revived due to Transcode's effect), plus one of the three locking monsters, either <a data-name=""Cyberse Magician"">Cyberse Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> on the field, being pointed by the Excode Talker. Any extras are welcome.  If everything works and I end up with a Transcode, Excode and one of the three lockers on the field, the locker protects all monsters from attacks or effects, and Excode protects the locker from effects.  However, one thing I cannot do is NEGATE, and that is why Nibiru works against me. Since Nibiru does not destroy, neither Excode, Masquerena or the Locker are able to prevent it from working. I THINK (not too sure, though) that Kaiju's, Sphere Mode, Lava Golem and the sort does not work due to the locker disallowing targetting, but since Nibiru neither targets nor destroy....

If everyone survives (which is VERY unlikely), next turn, using only one summon, we can bring both Transcode and Excode Talkers in a way that also protects our Clock Dragon.  However, this uses 11 summons as well.</td> </tr>  </table> As you can see, all scenarios lead to Nibiru. We COULD not Special Summon a few monsters on the beginning of the turn, but that would end at most with a unprotected Transcode Talker.  So, I need advices. What should I run on this deck?"

The deck can quite easily set one another up with how they can play to one another's strengths (to a point) and the access the two have to easy level 4's really helps facilitate plays for the two decks.

It  has a really cool goth aesthethic and i'm very m e n t a l l y i l l rn (more so than normal) so im fucking vibin with this archetype. Anyway here's a deck guide because I like these. This will prob be really obselete soon when more cards get revealed but whatever it's fucking cool. Tips appreciated because idk what i'm d- GOD DAMMIT EPSTIEN, I FUCKING TOLD YOU TH ERULES. YOU STAY IN THE GOD DAMN BASEMENT WHEN GUESTS ARE OVER  3x Tragedy- Tragedy is a great card, as it's basically a ROTA for the archetype once it's sent to the grave. This is an archetype designed with ditching cards to the grave in mind, as you can easily pitch it for a fusion, Super Poly cost, etc, meaning it's ROTA effect will go off easily and get your plays starting. ONce in the grave, it can be banished to recur a archetypal S/T back to the board, which is really nice for recovering lost cards on turn 2 to continue plays or manipulating the board state. You can only use one of these effects and once per turn, but it's still powerful. (all of the level 4 or lower Despian's have this hard once per turn, one effect per turn restriction so im only goingt o mention it here for the sake of simplictiy) 3x Comedy- Looking like me after a serious dip in my  mental health, Comedy is a pretty solid card for the deck for protection. It discards itself when a archetypal card you control is targeted for an effect, avoiding various meta cards like Drident. If Comedy is in the grave, it can tribute a fusion to summon itself. It can get fusions in the grave for effects and get bodies on the board, which is nice, but this effect is a bit situational. 3x Albert- God, why did they fucking name it Albert? That sounds so stupid. Anyway, Albert is a solid card, as on summon, it fetches an archetypal S/T. This is really nice, as the archetype uses a lot of S/T and can use the S/T to field swarm and fuse. And, if a face up fusion leaves the field because of the opponent, Albert can special summon himself and Imperm an opponent's monster. Albert's all around really solid as a searcher and control card, aside from the shitty name. 2x Name I can't spell- With a name I can't spell, this monster is really cool but not a staple 3 of, due to it's high level. I play it at 2 since it's a high level, to avoid bricking. Since the deck can search and special a lot, it can still get this monster out easily with it at 2. Anyway, onto the effect: If a monster from the extra is summoned, it can Imperm a monstrer on the board. This effect is amazing for interrupting combos midway through. Additionally, this has a special summoning condition, as if it's sent to the grave or banished for a fusion, you can bring it back. Generally, solid main deck boss monster that can be a bit bricky. The only main flaws is that it's a bit bricky due to a high level and it has a hard once per turn on the Imperm effect. 3x Fallen of Albaz- My baby boy. I included a Albaz engine, because A) lore B) naming shit with some of the cards C) it can easily fuse into some of the Despia monsters with it's effect. It's effect is basically just a super poly on summon, so as long as you have the field set up, you can use it to go into the Despia fusions and clear the opponent's board. Additonally, he can be used for Stigmata of white. 3x Stigmata of White- Stigmata of White is a fusion spell for Albaz, allowing you to use materials from hand, field, and grave, which is amazing and helps a ton with getting multiple fusion bodies on the board. Additionally, if it was discareded for my baby boy, it can be reset to the board, which is amazing. 3x Theatre- Oh god, no. Not the fucking ABYSS ACTOR FLASHBACKS, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- Jeffery Epstien here. I'll be taking over while Amy is having a breakdown. Now what the hell is a yu gi oh card? The field spell is the main archetypal fusion card, oddly enough. It allows you to fuse any level 8 or higher fusion, not an archetypal one, making this technically generic. This is great and means this archetype has engine potential. Anyway, it uses materials from hand and field, which is pretty standard. Additionally, if a non-fusion Fairy leaves the board because of the opponent, you can special summon a Fusion from your grave, making it hard for the opponent to clear your board. All around amazing card. 3x Curtain Rise- Curtain Rise is a E-tele for the archetype, allowing you to discard one to special summon a Despia from deck. while yes, this does also add a Despia to hand, you're never going to be searching, just summoning, to be honest. Anyway, the discard cost is surprisingly good in this deck, as it triggers Tragedy, a strong card you want in the grave.  Additionally, if a fusion would be destroyed by a card effect, you can banish Curtain Rise from the grave instead. This is also an amazing effect, making it incredibly hard to kill your boss monsters, as a lot of current strong monsters like Big Tiddy Cow rely on popping. 3x Super Poly- Amy decided to include the Super Poly package in this deck, to take full advantage of the generic summoning conditions of the Albaz fusions and the Despian fusions. This helps a lot with wiping boards going second and controlling the board going first. Additionally, it's discard cost triggers Tragedy, and this alongside cards like Albaz and other fusion cards helps to get tons of bodies on board incredibly fast. 2x Poly- Poly is just here in order to generically fuse into the fusions, in cases where your hand may be more bricky or less useful. Poly can also be searched off of Fusion Recycling Plant, which is quite nice. 2x Fusion Recycling Plant- Plant is a pretty nice searcher, as it adds either Poly if you have a clogged up hand, or maybe Super (I am unsure of the rulings of that). Additionally, during the end phase, Recycling Plant can bounce back a used up fusion material from grave to hand, setting up turn 2 plays. Neither of these effects are hard once per turns either. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming has two targets, as if you already have Theatre, you can search Plant, and visa versa. Generally, terra is a versatile and useful card for the deck. It's also Ash bait. 1x One for One- One for One is a solid card for getting bodies on board, as Comedy and Tragedy are both level 1's. Due to this, you can use One for One to help swarm the field for plays. Additionally, One for One discards, meaning it can trigger Tragedy. 3x Judgement- Judgement is a solid card for the deck, as if you control a level 8 or higher fusion (which you should since the archetype centers around them), you can pop the opponent's board of monsters weaker than them. Use this when they're weak, or use this in tandem with Qua, and you have a Raigeki on the opponent's turn for no cost. Fucking solid. It also has the same recursion effect as White. The solemns- I'll just group them together for simplicity. Since this is control focused, I tossed in 3 Strike and 2 Judgement to halt the opponent's plays. LP doesn't  matter very much and these are solid cards. If you can find the space, I reccomend playing Trap Trick to search them out. 3x Proscsenium- The main boss monster, Proscenium is a big boy with 3200 attack. It also has generic fusion materials, only requiring a Despia and a light and a dark. This makes it a great Super Poly target, as Lights and Darks are the two most common attributes in the game. It's main effect is that, during the MP, it can either banish or steal a extra deck monster from the opponent's graveyard. This is absolutely amazing, as it can interrupt plays, and if you manage to out a powerful boss monster, you can steal it for yourself. Additionally, whenever Prosc destroys a monster by battle, it inflicts damage to the opponent equal to whichever stat of the destroyed montser is higher. This guy is an absolute fucking monster, in both art and effect, and I love him. I like how they didn't resort to just giving it a negate to make it good. 3x Qua- First off, Qua also has great materials, as they're generic. Qua only requires a Despia and a light or Dark, the most common attributes in the game, making it an amazing super poly target. Anyway, Qua allows you to change the attack of all face up monsters, except for level 8 or higher fusions (AKA itself), to 0. This allows you to wipe boards using Judgement, and help you beat over problem monsters. Additionally, since this is a quick effect, it can be a surprisingly good interruption against problem decks like Drytron, which use the attack of the Drytrons for a ritual summon. Additionally, if it leaves the field because of the opponent, it allows you to special summon a Despia or Fallen of Albaz from deck, which is also amazing, and sets up turn 2 plays if your opponent manages to break your board. 2x Brigrand- Brigrand is a great Albaz target, as your opponent will most likely have many higher leveled bodies on board, depending on the match up. You can easily summon Brigrand to wipe their board using Fallen of Albaz. Additionally, only Brigrand can be targeted for effects and it can't be destroyed by battle, making it a strong wall to protect your other monsters. 1x Albion- Albion is also generic, only requiring Albaz and a Light monster. Light is the second most popular attribute in the game, so. Anyway, on summon, albion lets you fusion summon a level 8 or lower fusion, by banishing fusion materials from your graveyard, hand, or field. This effect is amazing, and lets you get multiple bodies on board easily just off of on 1 Albaz. 1x Golden Lord- Super Poly go brrrr. Same goes for the rest of the fusions from here on out Playing the deck is pretty easy. Going first, you normal Albert, search, fuse into huge fuckin monsters, and set a ton of backrow. Then you just beat the shit out of the opponent and move on with your day. I feel this deck has a ton of potential and is generally pretty powerful as a control deck. Have fun."

I stopped around the time when Links came in 2017 and have recently returned playing. I've always played Gladiator Beasts and this is my take on them, obviously with a lot of looking around for ideas. Any suggestions are welcomed. I call this deck Gladiator Beast Rejection not because of Gladiator Rejection, but because my focus is to get the big monsters to negate effects, spells, and traps. The objective is to build an unstoppable negate field with <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>, <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a> and/or <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> with <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a>.

There are many more combos.  Any comments and feedback are welcome. :)  Some obvious cards that are not in the deck because I don't have them: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></li> </ul>"

This is our super fun casual Red-Eyes deck that we love playing and playing against! It can hit people for 10k plus, and ","Hello, this is the deck we use on our YouTube videos!  We like to do casual Yugioh matches on youtube!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQPvrZvYXuI&amp;list=PLN7bNHPmGnd4B8RYlqbp8sVWu-D38tuR6  I dont like to run 3 Red-eyes Insight because it makes the games a bit too same-y, it's an incredible card though!  What cool stuff does this deck do? 1) Can put a Red-Eyes Black Dragon sword on a Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon  t1! That's a massive creature that resurrects normal monsters, cant be killed by effects, and pings you enemy for 500 whenever they do anything! 2) Red-Eyes Fusion out a Meteor Black Comet Dragon or Slash Dragon 3)Suicide Alternative Dragons to bring back to life Red-Eyes Black Dragon's with 4800 Attack! 4) Mirror Force  When I built this a lot of the cards where dirt cheap, I paid 25 cents each for my alternative dragons, and like a buck for the Return of the Dragon lords...It's a shame that this deck has gotten spendy.  I dont like the Red-eyes resurrection traps, I think they are very bad for red-eyes. Monster reborn and Return of Dragonlords lets you resurrect things the turn you need it, and extends your plays greatly. And Return of the Dragonlord's GY effect is insane, especially in a deck that likes to go HUGE with Red-Eyes black dragon sword. The Red-eyes resurrections are more bricks then help  We spent a long time getting this deck to a strong but casual power level we think makes yugioh awesome. As a rule of thumb, we don't like to run Hand Traps like Impermanence/Ash and counter monsters(Like Dragoon, Harbinger, toadally awesome, ect ect) as it allows one to create truly unbeatable boards t1 or set up 1hitKills, and that's just unfun IMO.  Why no Dragoon? I tried running a proxy Dragoon against Stephnie once, and I summoned it, killed both of her Blue eyes White dragons, dealt 6k to her with her own destroyed monsters, and just attacked for game because he couldn't even be hit by her traps. It's a very unfun card that only should be used vrs the meta IMO.  If you have friends that play casual, I cant recommend this deck enough, it's fun and INCREDIBLY consistent!"

So when comparing the previous builds of the deck from my old account: Kyo Saisto and making adjustments to the deck to suit its playstyle, I am currently running a Zombie world engine with Doomking Balderoch and having it combo with Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi can make the two become a threat on the field with 3 negates and a way of banishing a card from either the field or GY. I am also making use of the Shiranui support line with cards such as Shiranui Squire and Shiranui SpectralSword Shade to then go into Shiranui Squiresaga and then further extend with the spell card Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi Manuscript to further synchro summon into Shiranui Sunsaga which then can help wiping the board whilst at the same time recycling your extra deck. As per usual when playing Mayakashi, it is important to climb from level 3 to level 11 with the use of Hajun when summoned can speacial summon out another Mayakashi monster such as Dakki to start the synchro climb and cards like Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi can act as a foolish burial of the deck as it allows you to dump a zombie monster to the GY such as Necroworld Banshee, Glow-up Bloom and Mezuki are key cards that can help setup for more GY plays. For handtraps I've managed to add cards like Ash Blossom &amp; Ghost Ogre to help put a stop to my opponents plays.  &nbsp;  For the side deck, I have Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion reserved, Ghost Reaper for a generic level 3 Tuner, Another copy of Burial from a different Dimension for being able to recycle cards such as Mezuki back into the graveyard, one copy of book of life as well as a copy of Fateful Hour to act as monster reborns and lastly Magic cylinder and I know not many people these days don't really play this card in their deck but its pretty useful for a rather more defensive play.  &nbsp;  Feel free to leave some of your feedbacks about the deck down below and I would love to hear your guys advice on how I can improve the deck as one day I would love to play in my first locals/event."

One mistake I see players does is summoning Zeroboros early in the game. DON'T. It's a late game card ya dinguss. Imagine having a 10k atk beat-stick and a 3k wheenie.  So obviously this deck is a Anti-Meta and Non-Meta deck. Metaphys Deadalus if used right will deal with every single meta deck and you will see you won your opponent surrendered message on the screen a lot. Becouse they start crying when they see all of their monsters get banishd and they can't even activate anything to respond that banish. L. (Deadalus + Field Spell Combo)  If you live tru the 3rd round your chances of winning is quite high. IF YOU DONT MESS UP."

Go easly for OTK combo and overkill your opponent or Summon Big Boys Numeronius Monsters C1000 / iC1000 with 100000 att,"Hello guys,  Here is the new version of Numeron deck that I built. I've worked a lot on this deck and I succeed to defeat a lot of meta decks with this deck. I hope you will enjoy it.  With this deck, you have 92% to draw Numeron Network on your first turn if you start second and 86% if you play first.  There is two possibilities with this deck :  <span><strong><u>I/ Going for OTK combo</u></strong></span>  I've played a lot Numeron decks and I know that most of the time we quickly win by OTK our opponent during our first turns by summon all Numeron monsters and attacking with them (first one : 1000 attack -&gt; 2000 attack -&gt; 4000 attack -&gt; 8000 attack !)... In order to do that, I added these cards on this deck : <ul>  	<li>Against monsters : <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> : just wow with Numeron decks, because it doesn't target, it can negate multiple monsters effects and your opponent cannot respond to its effect. This card can also negate ""surprise"" monster effects during the battle phase, which is very welcome.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> : amazing card, especially for Numeron decks</li>  	<li>And the final one... <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>... Which is just the most AMAZING card for Numeron decks. You can tribute two monsters on the opponent side to summon this card on your opponent side. This card is just perfect against most of ""full board ultimate 7 negates...."". Also I added Dark Spirit's Mastery in order to search this card. Because after a lot of games, I realized how good is this card with Numeron decks and most of the time, I win by the help of this card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Against ""Full trap board trololo go fu*** yourself"", I added: <ul>  	<li>You can use <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, which can also be used against monsters</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Red reboot"">Red reboot</a> : this card is done for OTK decks. So it's just a mandatory to have this card on Numeron decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Hey, Trunade"">Hey, Trunade</a> : I discovered this card recently... And wow, it's a greater ""Red reboot"" which is not limited. Hey hey !! Perfect.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>II/ Summoning the Big Numeronius Boys</u></strong></span>  The alternative is to try to summon Numeronius cards : <a data-name=""Number C1000: Numeronius"">Number C1000: Numeronius</a> or <a data-name=""Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia"">Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia</a>. This combo is not recommanded if you want to play safe and just win... But against bad players, you can have a lot of fun playing this combo.  You have Unchained monsters to do that.  The combo in order to do that : <ol>  	<li>You need in your hand : 1 or 2 <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> (92% to draw 1 Numeron Network on your first turn) and one Unchained monster. <ol>  	<li>If you just have 1 <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a>, you will need to have another one on your next turn in order to do this combo... Which is not very recommanded because you just count on the luck.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Summon the four Numeron monsters</li>  	<li>Summon <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a>. Which will banish all monsters on the field</li>  	<li>Protect yourself by using <a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a> or an Unchained monster in defense mode or <a data-name=""Numeron Wall"">Numeron Wall</a></li>  	<li>End your turn</li>  	<li>If you survived and you still have <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> on your field, summon <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a> which was banished</li>  	<li>Then use an Unchained monster from your hand to destroy your <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a></li>  	<li>Use : <ol>  	<li>The effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> to use the effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Chaos Ritual"">Numeron Chaos Ritual</a> from your deck</li>  	<li>Or use directly the effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Chaos Ritual"">Numeron Chaos Ritual</a> from your hand, if this card is in your hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Then summon <a data-name=""Number C1000: Numeronius"">Number C1000: Numeronius</a>... Which has 10000 attack.</li>  	<li>Then, if you are lucky and your opponent destroy by card effect <a data-name=""Number C1000: Numeronius"">Number C1000: Numeronius</a>, you will have the possibility to summon <a data-name=""Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia"">Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia</a> with 100000 attack :D ... It's not the best card it's true, but I love this card, it's very sexy to succeed to summon a 100000 attack monster like this one. And I won some games with this card, so satisfying.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Tips :</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>If you play first: go direcly to <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress MegaClops"">Infinitrack Fortress MegaClops</a> to protect yourself. After that, you can use Forbidden Droplet on Megaclops to destroy it and in order to have the possibility to summon your Numeron monsters. You can also replace MegaClops by <a data-name=""Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa, bow of the goddess"">Apollousa, bow of the goddess</a></li>  	<li>If you play against ""trololo you can't attack me because I'm a Exodia Player with a lot of cards to prevent attacks"", go to Burn effect with <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a>.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Have fun,  Best regards,  Cyncop"

This deck can make archlord Kristya fairly easily as a broken floodgate to lock out your opponent. At first I was playing <a data-name=""herald of perfection"">herald of perfection</a>, but I realized that you need exact levels for that card, so I switched to <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimatness"">Herald of Ultimatness</a> instead, seeing as this deck can bring it out just as easily. I think the new fairy support that just got revealed would be a decent extender for the deck, but I don't know if it's in the deck builder yet. I upped the count of the field spell to two, because three still seems like too much, but two seems to be fine.

I'm aware Evolzar Dolkka and Animadorned Archosaur are extremely useful in this deck, but I haven't either. Plus,","With the banning of True King of All Calamities, the boss of this deck has shifted to Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, though it isn't the only way to win. For pesky cards difficult to get rid of, such as Red Eyes Dark Dragoon, Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju, can easily take it's place and get flipped face down with UCT's ability. Gizmek Kaku is useful against opponents' big Link monsters, such as an opposing Borrelsword Dragon, so long as it remains in the Extra Deck Zone. With all the banishing done for UCT and Miscellaneousaurus, summoning Overtex Qoatlu and bolstering Tyranno Infinity's attack should be a cakewalk. Plus, with the pairing of Overtex Qoaltus and Lost World, you can easily pop off Babycerasaurus's and Petiterandon's effects from the deck. True King Lithosagym is great for preventing any possiblilty of annoying Extra Deck monsters, such as Dragoon. True King Agnimazud effortlessly gets around the effects that prevent card destruction, as it banishes.  In regards to the extra deck, Evolzar Laggia is great for stopping the activation of card effects or summoning of monsters. Additionally, after his effect pops off, summoning an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno should be simple as pie (or is it pi? I honestly haven't a clue). Dark Rebellion and Dark Requiem both do essentially the same thing, though Requiem's effect is much more potent and cheaper to activate. Knightmare Phoenix is useful as spell destruction and sending dinosaur monsters to the grave for an UCT. Borrelsword Dragon is useful to pair up with UCT since it can change a monster to defense position on either players' turns. Martial Metal Marcher, Goyo Guardian, Infernity Doom Archfiend, and Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu are mainly there to help get out Crystal Wing and Clear Wing, though they are useful in other ways. Jiujiu will almost always be protected by its own effect in this deck as monsters are frequently hitting the grave. Its additional effect also serves to bolster Tyranno Infinity and/or summon Overtex Qoaltus. It's easy to clear your hand with this deck, allowing Infernity Doom Archfiend's effects to have full potency. Finally, Goyo Guardian serves to prevent some cards from hitting the opponent's graveyard if they rely on it while bolstering your own defenses."

I call it semi-budget because you do need the 1 Archosaur at least. Pretty consistent going 2nd deck and also has the ability to pop off going first. I managed to win even with getting Lancea'd several times and getting Misc negated a few times. Would be more consistent with Pot of Prosperity or Extravagance. Some notes about the choices I made: <ol>  	<li>The kaiju is nice to have. Even though he has high attack, it's great for outing Dragoon and other problem cards, and is also of course searchable with Oviraptor</li>  	<li>I put some backrow removal in the main deck simply because people play traps at my local</li>  	<li>Drawing into Archosaur isn't the end of the world as long as you have another Dino and/or Fossil Dig.

Here is a semi playable budget control version! Similar to the budget trap shaddol build. The idea is to control the board and use dogmatika punishment to send the worse extra monsters and then use those to miracle fusion. One idea is to send the masked fire hero and any other masked hero to make contrast off of a miracle fusion. Two miracle fusions and two sunrisers for that point as well. Try it out online and it is a very cheap build if you love heros but do not have the money for the expensive builds.

Most of the <strong>Stigmatika</strong> cards in LIOV do not work that well with the <strong>Stigmatika</strong>/<strong>Despia</strong> support in DAMA especially since the <strong>Despia</strong> are Fairies and not dragons and they are also not Light Attribute. <strong>Hecatrice</strong> and <strong>Vahalla</strong> ar my interpretation of how to get to a Light monster easier, but the baby chaos dragons along with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> might work better if you want to utilize<strong> Stigmatika of White</strong>.  3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 3 <strong>Albus</strong>, 3 <strong>Hecatrice</strong> are your non-<strong>Despia</strong> mons. <strong>Dramaturgia</strong> of<strong> Despia</strong> is a very lackluster negate, but it summons itself if its banished from FIELD or HAND by something like<strong> Albion</strong> which makes it only a one-of. <strong>Albert</strong> is your most important Normal/Special Summon aside from <strong>Albus</strong> as he searches a <strong>Stigmatika</strong> Spell/Trap which will often be <strong>Theatre</strong> as it has a fusion effect that isn't limited to using a dragon monster as one of the materials. <strong>Despian of Tragedy</strong> is probably your best form of consistency as it searches a<strong> Despia</strong> upon being banished or sent for a fusion or other effect. Its second effect gets you back <strong>Curtain Rise</strong> but ""only 1 effect per turn, and only once that turn."" <strong>Despian of Comedy</strong> is aight but you should probably side it if you believe in there being targeting effects when the game is more about negates.  3 <strong>Valhalla</strong>. 3 <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> for<strong> Albus</strong>. 3 <strong>Despia</strong>, <strong>Stigmatika Theatre</strong> whose fusion eff doesnt 't restrict you to using a dragon as material. 3 <strong>Stigmatika Curtain Rise</strong> which is bonkers as it either searches, summons from deck, and it protects against board wipes. 1 <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong> since <strong>Despia</strong> are Faries. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong>. 3 <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> which is ironic due to<strong> Instant Fusion</strong>. 3 <strong>Super Poly</strong>. 1 <strong>Dogmatika Encounter</strong> which gives you access to <strong>Albus</strong> I guess.  ED: 1 <strong>The First Darklord</strong> which is a<strong> Punishment</strong> target and it gets you a Fairy every turn. 1 <strong>Dracrown of Mysterion</strong> which is just funny I guess since I have like a seizure trying to understand its effect with my ape brain. 1 <strong>Despian Proscenium</strong> which is like <strong>Goyo Emperor</strong> (?) and <strong>Evil HERO Inferno Wing</strong> (?). 2 <strong>Despain Quaeritis</strong> which is the easiest fusion to summon, otk potential, it floats into <strong>Albus</strong>. 2 <strong>Albion</strong> which is one of my favourite cards since it has so much versatility. 2 <strong>Titaniklad</strong> which is here for the atk gain and EP <strong>Albus</strong> search. 1 <strong>Brigand</strong> which is an <strong>Albus</strong>/<strong>Albion</strong> target. <strong>Starving Venom</strong> for <strong>Super Poly</strong>. 2 <strong>Musician King</strong> as a Light off of <strong>Retort Fusion</strong>. 2 <strong>N'tss</strong> to send off of <strong>Punishment</strong>.  Side Deck is nothing special. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> is bonkers if you know you are going against a link deck since its a Dark, its a Dragon, and it gets you cards which is much needed in this deck. The rest are just traps you would use going first."

There is nothing you can do, unless you have other monsters, to link into Bardiche. 2 - Not a comeback: Same case as number 1, this is a total non-meta combo... Any negate can break this easily. 3 - Tag Duels: You can play it if you're 1st, otherwise there is nothing you can do... If you're 3rd/4th there is probably negates, which you can't handle and if your partner doesn't have a counter for it... You're both dead.</li>  	<li>Pros: 1 - Versatibility: You can probably combo more than I've shown and I didn't say anything about Simoon the Poison Wind as a combo starter. I've only shown the basic so you can continue it. 2 - Bricks: There is a lot of monsters on it, many of them can Special itself from the hand. It's very hard to brick with this deck. And you can even Pot of Disparity the Synchros, if needed.</li>  	<li>Side: I haven't put anything on side, because I'm bad at the Side Deck. This deck probably can't use Handtraps, because it would probably be a brick, unless you start using Deskbots/Mecha Phantom, but that is too much for a deck.</li> </ul> Good luck at using this deck and thanks for clicking on this page."

Sorry for my long 6 month hiatus. College, the pandemic, and things in my personal life forced me to take a break from the game for a long while. This list is an updated version of my Bujin Tri-Brigade list from October 2020. In 6 months, a whole LOT has changed!   </strong>The first thing that inspired me to recreate this list is the fact that Bujin will be receiving some new support in the next set. I was taken aback by Konami's decision to breathe life back into a dead strategy, but I'm not complaining. Here's a brief summary of the new cards!  <span>Bujin Torfiune:  </span>Fun fact: This is the only Bujin Main Deck monster that is based on another Monster card rather than a character from GX.  Anyway, you can Tribute this guy toSpecial Summon 2 Bujin monsters with different Types from your deck and when you Xyz Summon a Bujin Xyz Monster while Torifune is in the GY, you can equip him to the Xyz Monster which makes it banish anything it destroys by battle. This makes Susanowo finally worth going into and promotes a more aggressive strategy with the archetype rather than a control strategy.  <span>Bujin Mahitotsu  </span>YUGI BOY! (sorry) This guy can be Special Summoned by discarding another Bujin monster (great for getting Bujingi monsters out of your hand.) You then have two effects you can chose from; you can either send a Bujin monster from your hand to add another from your deck or banish a Bujin monster to send a Bujin monster from your deck. This is vulnerable to Ash but you can still get rid of Bujin monsters you don't want in your hand and in this deck you can set up Tri-Brigade Revolt by banishing Bujin monsters.  <span>Bujintersection  </span>Sadly, this is not an archetype exclusive Kaiser Colloseum. Instead, it protects your Bujins from being destroyed by card effects (except in the Battle Phase.) You can also send a Bujin from your field to the yard to negate the effect of a face-up card, and you can destroy Bujintersection during the End Phase to Special Summon any Bujin monster you want from your Graveyard.   The rest of the deck is a fairly standard affair, just do Tribrigade plays and make Bujin Xyz Monsters.  Any feedback is always welcome. Stay gold! :)"

This seems really cool though, so I rolled with it. This is a blind second deck that aims to break your opponent's board. I've wanted to make a batteryman deck for a long time, but nothing seemed good enough until now. Please feel free to give constructive feedback in this deck, this is still just mainly a concept, but I really like the idea of it and hope to continue to make it better."

It really is something to pull a new set that basically makes most of the old cards seem useless by comparison.  Despite the ominous introduction, I haven't changed much in my strategy from before. The only thing that improved from last week was the offensive part (every tribute got its well-deserved retirement and non-tribute powerhouses like Jirai Gumo, Seven-Colored Fish und Ryu-Kishin Powered entered the fray) in conjunction with a few nice control tools in Paralyzing Potion and the Clowns.  The biggest impact had the staples: I won't pretend that dual Dark Hole + dual Mirror Force didn't carry the heck out of me. I unfortunately didn't get Imperial Order, Magician of Faith or Solemn Judgment; the first pretty much is universally owned by everyone except me!  But yeah, I managed. I successfully defended the crown against my friends.  The concept of the deck is the same as the last: Sit on 2k defenders, summon your tribute guy and dominate. Sanga of the Thunder und Suijin replaced my old tribute payoffs and definitely pulled their weight.  The other big portion of the deck was, again, Yami. This time, the boost was much more significant than before: Mystical Elf, her cuter sister and Aqua Madoor could survive any encounter with Jirai Gumo under Yami. Ryu-Kishin Powered could at least trade with the strongest beater without any drawbacks, Seven-Colored Fish. Crass Clown could also stand its own against former non-tribute stars Uraby and Skull Red bird, but that barely ever came up.  The other monsters were mostly just filler that made sense given the feel of the deck: Giant Soldier of Stone and Prevent Rat are just solid normals since 2k defenders are the heart and soul of this deck.  Pulling thre Prevent Rat also allowed me to kick Spirit of the Harp in the site who had negative synergy with Yami.  Hane-Hane still punishes opposing tribute payoffs and equip-heavy setups.  The clowns were decent with protection (Paralyzing Potion or Swords) but were kind of meh in this stage of the game. Dream Clown nicely punished walling up, though, and occasionally forced stronger 2k defenders like Giant Soldier of Stone and Aqua Madoor into attack!  Masked Sorcerer is sort of a win more card and intended as such. I lack any form of search or draw power since I didn't pull any of the big searchers or Pot of Greed, so I looked for a way to get through my deck faster. It made good situations better and snowballed somewhat easier with Stim-Pack, but nothing more.  Stop Defense, Fissure, Dark Hole and Tribute to the Doomed are all meant to keep opposing field building in check and disrupt potential counter-walling up. Block Attack served a similar purpose as the ""reverse walls"" of Dark Elf and Jirai Gumo have poor Def.  The secret stars were the equips, however. Paralyzing Potion nicely vegetablized any threatening monster on the opposing end and slowed the game down enough for me to either build up advantage or remove the card with the clowns. Stim-Pack was amazing: It provided huge momentum swings and turned any of my decent attacking monsters into virtual powerhouses. The drawback only hurt me once. Usually, your monsters won't sit around so long to make the attack loss actually noticeable. And if you do, you're usually in a stalemate situation already. Thankfully, most of my friends missed this amazing card!  Mirror Force is just Mirror Force and really enabled the clowns. You could nicely dismantle set cards with a position change and be protected by the holy barrier against offensive threats.  The Extra is just filler cards, ranked according to looks.  The side is, for the most part, filler stuff. Sword &amp; Shield seemed cool as a finisher on paper but I ultimately never used it. Plain walling up was usually more beneficial than a big offensive push.  Tremendous Fire was doing too little for field presence to ever warrant a main slot.  Time Wizard was supposed to serve as a third, riskier Dark Hole. Sided it in once but never used the effect.  Two-Pronged is still a decent tribute spot removal but thanks to my generally better tools available now, I never really bothered with it.  Remove Trap was pretty much dead since there are no permanent traps to speak of where it would work. Imperial Order as the only notable one for my deck negates it &gt;.&lt;  Mask of Darkness was supposed to recycle Mirror Forces. Never put it in once, though. I valued my other control tools too much to justify a wonky two-card combo in an already somewhat inconsistent deck."

This is a going second deck primarily. It has tools to help going first but it's best going second.  Your main win condition here is obviously Gren Maju Da Eiza for the OTK. Easiest possible way is using Eater of Millions to banish your extra deck giving Gren Maju 6000 ATK on its own.  Gizmek helps with this while providing an annoying board presence even on your opponent's turn. It also is your target for the effects of Armageddon Knight and Dark Grepher unless you have Dimensional Fissure or Macro Cosmos active in which case their target becomes Necroface or in a pinch Snipe Hunter.  Speaking of, Snipe Hunter is there to hopefully draw out your opponent's counter plays. However if he doesn't (and in some cases won't because your opponent is waiting for a more powerful effect to negate) you can do some pretty effective damage to their board while also using the Dangers to mess with them. Keep in mind Dangers still work if banished when discarded.  Speaking of the Dangers, this deck includes a Level 8 XYZ package as a potential backup. This just helps with consistency but also can help with taking out pieces of your opponent's board especially if you have a Gren Maju and/or Eater in your hand that you'd rather not have negated.  This deck is definitely rogue and definitely anti-meta. It will brick occasionally and it will get beat by efficient combos and if you really don't care about that you will love it. Personally I just adore this deck because opponents will rarely if ever be prepared for it unless they're running a broken combo like Avian in which case you'd be in trouble no matter what."

The ""Aesir""-""Nordic"" conglomate came out during the same time when ""Six Samurai"" were en vogue (again) and even had some struggles early in their lifetime. However, back in the day the ability to summon out a 4000 ATK beater semi-consistently was quite impressive, so they managed to turbo out a beatstick and win the game from there on a regular basis. However, time was not kind to the nordic pantheon of Yugioh, the game got faster and having big boss monsters became less impressive, leaving the archetype in their current state even after receiving a few support cards to help them out. After consulting the ""Nordic"" Discord channel and working through the cards the archetype has to offer, I came up with this:</p> <p>The ""Nordic Beasts"" are definitely the branch to play in my opinion as they are easily the best as well as relative easy to support via generic cards. ""<a data-name=""Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts"">Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" is really just a Level 4 Tuner, but once in a blue moon you might be able to Special Summon it using its own effect. The goats in form of ""<a data-name=""Tanngrisnir of the Nordic Beasts"">Tanngrisnir of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Tanngnjostr of the Nordic Beasts"">Tanngnjostr of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" can provide floating effects, more chump blockers on board and, eventually, Synchro material to go into the big guys. ""<a data-name=""Vanadis of the Nordic Ascendant"">Vanadis of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" is the least restrictive Tuner monster the ""Nordics"" have to offer while also being able to change her level if really necessary, ""<a data-name=""Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant"">Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" can kickstart a summon into an ""Aesir"" monster without the need of accessing the Extra Deck beforehand and ""<a data-name=""Mimir of the Nordic Ascendant"">Mimir of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" is one of the saddest tries to swarm that I have personally seen so far, but I still run it at one for the lack of better options and potentially having Spell cards in the deck that outlive their usefulness over the course of the game. ""<a data-name=""Alviss of the Nordic Alfar"">Alviss of the Nordic Alfar</a>"" can also kickstart an ""Aesir"" summon and give them some more longevity. There are only a few generic monster options, one being three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Cat"">Rescue Cat</a>"" since the kitty can fetch the ""Nordic"" goats, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Performapal Hip Hippo"">Performapal Hip Hippo</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>"".</p> <p>Speaking of that Spell card, you might notice that there are both three copies of ""<a data-name=""Hippo Carnival"">Hippo Carnival</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>"", which are in the deck to pay for the cost of the ""Nordic"" Link monster ""<a data-name=""Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant"">Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"", which normally needs a bunch of cards to get an ""Aesir"" monster onto the board, but can now use the tokens in a way that leaves your other resources intact while also working around the Extra Deck ban the tokens normally impose onto you. One ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" clears the field and can be fairly helpful since there are OTK scenarios the deck can make use of sometimes, while three ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" might drive the price of the deck up, but are frankly the only thing I have found that helps with the poor consistency of the archetype overall.</p> <p>There are also a few Traps: Two ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" can search the others, while two ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" might not be everyones favorite but can potentially keep you alive for longer. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Nordic Relic Megingjord"">Nordic Relic Megingjord</a>"" can double the attack of one of your ""Nordic"" or ""Aesir"" monsters, which also causes them to be unable to attack directly, but also gives cards like ""<a data-name=""Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts"">Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" 3200 ATK to beat over monsters that would be normally out of its reach, while ""Aesir"" boss monsters can try to pull a ""Utopia Double"" move and hit stuff for 8000 ATK (in case of ""<a data-name=""Odin, Father of the Aesir"">Odin, Father of the Aesir</a>""). Two ""<a data-name=""Divine Relic Mjollnir"">Divine Relic Mjollnir</a>"" can improve your ""Aesir"" monsters by giving one of the a second attack, which is okay-ish but provides killing potential against monsters and players alike, and the two ""Solemns"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" round the deck up nicely while giving at least some disruption to a deck without any.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is packed with lots of multiples due to ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"": Three ""<a data-name=""Odin, Father of the Aesir"">Odin, Father of the Aesir</a>"" are your main beaters with the highest stat line and temporal immunity to Spell/Trap effects, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Thor, Lord of the Aesir"">Thor, Lord of the Aesir</a>"" can stop opposing monster effects during your turn, and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant"">Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" are absolutely crucial to get into the ""Aesirs"" quickly. Aside from that, there is one ""<a data-name=""Loki, Lord of the Aesir"">Loki, Lord of the Aesir</a>"" for the rare cases when he provides something the others cannot, one ""<a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a>"" for removal via banishment, ""<a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"" against decks that might struggle to get removal to kill it, ""<a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>"" for disruption"" and the ""Knightmare"" duo consisting of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" as further removal options.</p> Like I said, time as well as Konami themselves were not really kind to the ""Aesir"" and their ""Nordic"" servants, but there is still a thriving fan base trying their best to make something worthwhile with the archetype(s). There are various ""Nordic"" cards that I did not feature in this deck list, but if you want to look at what else they have to offer or even give building a ""Nordic"" deck a shot, feel free to visit my ""Aesir""/""Nordic"" archetype analysis on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/02/27/archetype-analysis-nordic/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/02/27/archetype-analysis-nordic/</a>"

Well, it's time to put you on the test... These bosses won't be easy to kill... You still wanna p","Hi !  There is a ""Competitive"" version of the Generaider deck. This deck's advantage is that it build easely strong interruptions, with a lot of varied effects and without (most of the time) using your normal summon (except with ""<em><strong>Loptr, Shadow Of The Generaider Bosses</strong></em>"", that can tribute himself to special summon from the deck ""<em><strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss Of Light</strong></em>"" and then be able to search for your ""<em><strong>Generaider Boss Stage</strong></em>"" or ""<em><strong>Generaider Boss Quest</strong></em>"" but it doesn't happend often).  This is why I play the Invoked engine, because the normal summon is needed for ""<em><strong>Aleister The Invoker</strong></em>"" and is useless of Generaider. Plus, the Invoked engine can be used as a shield for ""<em><strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong></em>"" or to protect you from ""<em><strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong></em>"" and is super-consistent, at least 13 starters on your deck, even without ""Generaider Boss Fight"", that can be sometimes situational. <ul>  	<li>3 Loptr, Shadow Of The Generaider Bosses</li>  	<li>3 Generaider Boss Stage</li>  	<li>3 Aleister The Invoker</li>  	<li>3 Magical Meltdown</li>  	<li>1 Terraforming</li> </ul> But the big problem of this deck is that it is extremely dependant to the field spell.

It might mean something...?,Randomness for Master Rule 5:  This deck might somehow be religiously Christian so keep that in mind. For the most part just go with the flow and see what you can do in regards to your opponent. Don't think about the extra deck at all until you need it; it's the most random part of this build. The deck is also possibly anti-meta but I'm not sure since it respects people's graves.

The First Darklord was a busted card that was just waiting for the right support. ,"The idea of the deck is too summon the First Darklord with the effect of the field, then keep bringing back your superbias and fairies with it for some nice +2 every turn. The endboard depends on the hand but at the very least you can have the First D and Dramaturgia and when you open well you can end on the First D + I.P + Condemned + Ixchel/Nasten with some traps in GY.  I.P is really good in the deck, the fact that you can bring back 2 monsters during your oponnent's turn means that you can immediately  go into Goddess of the closed world using one of your opponent's monster. The interactions with the field, jester and curtain rise in grave mean that the first D is actually kinda hard to out and always comes back so the deck has a very good grind game."

WHIIP GOOD!,"LADIES , GENTLEMANS AND NON- BINARY PEOPLE, This is my attempt to make this deck kind of competitive. My last Witchcrafter deck was a more a fun/casual oriented (I was using banned cards), but this I tried and tested a lot to came with this build. It's  a very explosive build ( Verre can become almost  A Gren maju in terms of atk value) but some times you can play in a more conservative way, nevertheless it's a lot of fun.  &nbsp;  <b><i>Witchcrafter,  Artificers of magic!!</i></b>  The Witchcrafter archetype is adorable in all artwork that is presented, linking the lore of the spellcaster universe ( Endymion, Spellbook, Invokeds), making a third force to  balance power between them. They don't store knowledge like  Prophecy-Spellbook or  use knowledge for power and war like Endymion, instead they use for  (like the name says) craft magic artefacts  that which one of the Witchcrafter are responsible for one process (pottery , glass, jewelry, etc). Enough about them, let’s get into the deck.  &nbsp;  <b>Main deck </b><b><i>Monsters:</i></b>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Schmietta"">Witchcrafter Schmietta</a>: </b> every low level  Witchcrafter has the effect which she can tribute herself, then  discard a spell card to summon any Witchcrafter from the deck. What  makes <b>Witchcrafter Schmietta</b> unique is the ability to send any Witchcrafter card, in special <b><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a></b> for crazy combos later on.  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Genni"">Witchcrafter Genni</a>: </b>Genni was the “glue” that this deck was lacking.The effect that she banished herself with another Witchcrafter spell card to use this effect again… it’s crazy.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Pittore"">Witchcrafter Pittore</a>: </b>Pittore is very risky but with so many Witchcrafter spell cards in theis deck, I think this is enough.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Potterie"">Witchcrafter Potterie</a>: </b>She does absolutely nothing ‘cause Witchcrafter spell cards can recover from the  GY by themself, but … man… she is adorable lol.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Golem Aruru"">Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</a>: </b>a beefie Hand trap, the ability to bounce any opponent’s monster  or recover a <b> </b>Witchcrafter  spell card and with 2800 ATK it’s even more juicy.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>: </b>Can pop a face up card  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Edel"">Witchcrafter Edel</a>: </b>Edel was more useful in the past, but today with <b> <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Unveiling"">Witchcrafter Unveiling</a> </b>is no longer escential, nevertheless is a good beater.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Mademe Verre"">Witchcrafter Mademe Verre</a>: </b>The favorite snob loli, this little brat it’s  an <i>Inferno </i>(i’m cursing in my native language). She can negate a face up monster by discarding a spell card, boost a spellcaster by  1000 ATK for which  different spell card in your hand, combos with <b><a data-name=""Spell Chronicle"">Spell Chronicle</a> and <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a>… </b> Now I know why she looks so snobbish in the artwork.  <strong>2x Effect veiler: </strong> one of my favorite hand traps and also a Spellcaster. A Fantastic way to deals with the majority of monster.  &nbsp;  <b>Spell cards</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Holiday"">Witchcrafter Holiday</a>: </b>Every spell card of this archetype returns for the player hand if weren’t used in this turn, and of course has an additional unique effect.This card is basically  a monster reborn for the archetype.  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Unveiling"">Witchcrafter Unveiling</a>: </b>Special summons any Witchcrafter from your hand, the department  that was lacking in this deck.  <b> </b>  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Creation"">Witchcrafter Creation</a>: </b>Search any Witchcrafter monster from your deck  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a>: </b>Can make you draw a card if your  Witchcrafter monster destroys another monster by attack. <b> </b>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Bystreet"">Witchcrafter Bystreet</a>: </b>Protects your monster for one destruction.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Draping"">Witchcrafter Draping</a>: </b>a Mystical Space Typhoon on steroids, bouncing any spell/trap card up the number Witchcrafter you control.  &nbsp;  1x <strong>Secret  Village of the  Spellcaster</strong>: An awesome floodgate in spellcaster based deck that can shut down any deck that is reliant in spell cards  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>: </b>search <b> <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a></b> card.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>: </b>a draw card for spellcaster type monster, can even put some GY setup for future plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>1X Called by the  Grave</strong>: The perfect anti hand trap and Gy plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>2x Pot of  Extravagance: </strong>Draw even more cards  &nbsp;  <b>Trap cards</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a>: </b>the effect that matters is the GY one. Banishing itself to add to you handy  any Witchcrafter card with different names from your banishment pile… is insane if you consider you are running  <b><a data-name=""Spell Chronicle"">Spell Chronicle</a> </b>in this deck.  &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck</b>  &nbsp;  The extra deck is more kind of a tool to deal with the unknown, so  I’ll not discuss it. Your main play is on the main deck, fell free to put whatever you want.  &nbsp;  <b>Conclusion</b>  A very fun waifu deck , with so many options and so insane plays..

Spell Ruler seemed like a particularly promising set due to its abundancy of broken spells and decent equip spells. The last one actually was a staple in my friends' decks so it was reasonable to assume that they would be salivating over even the worse ones in here; they all are better than what we got in the previous sets, after all. Being prepared against those seemed (and indeed was) vital.  As for the broken spells... Imagine not pulling any of those and you'd have my situation. I did get two Spellbinding Circle, though, which is at least decent. Cyber Jar also was a very welcome addition to the deck.  I personally looked forward to the recruiters (Monsters that special summon a monster with 1,5k or less Atk from the deck after being destroyed by battle) since they would outline the direction I would be going into for the weeks to come.  My pulls gave me two options: Wind beatdown when the field spells drop and Earth with utility options. I hoped for a few Mother Grizzly to go in on an Umi deck with A Legendary Ocean later, but ended up pulling not a single one. Seeing that pretty much all of the winds printed so far were garbage whereas Earth had possibilities with Labyrinth Wall and Dream Clown as utility slots, my choice was simple.  The deck doesn't really have a cohesive strategy, but instead aims to profit from its wide variety of utility cards and removal to keep the upper hand. Equip spam joined tribute summoning Sanga of the Thunder/Suijin as potential for continuous board domination, however. The biggest enabler of my previous ""strategy"" was Yami, so it had no place in the deck anymore. Hey, at least Gaia, Succubus Knight and pretty much all of LoB's monster lineup can chill there now over Sogen!  Staying true to that, I cut down on the 2k defenders. Given the preferences of my small circle of friends, most of these would be wrecked before accumulating board advantage by numbers. I only kept those with reasonably high attack to possibly establish a board presence with equips. They were replaced by a swarming engine with a playset of Giant Germ which was supposed to enable my Tributes faster than the big-butted vanillas ever could.  Given this bigger focus on offense, I brought out the biggest non-tribute beaters I had to offer in Whiptail Crow and Seven-Colored Fish. Despite not getting punished for it, the former was a HUGE theoretical mistake. Guardian Of The Throne Room has the same stat line but an immunity against Paralyzing Potion which still is a decent stun option and would be much more relevant in utility!  Dark Elf and Jirai Gumo still are the ""reverse walls"" (monsters that discourage attacks with massive attack over massive def without any attacking themselves) they were before with the difference that attacking became much more enticing due to the massive amount of equip spells floating around. They also form the magic six (more than 50% chance to have one of those cards in your opening five) with my other walls, though incidentally so here.  The only exception to walling up being bad is, yeah, the wall in the deck. 3k still is very difficult to overcome even in a meta filled to the brim with equip spells. And it's even better if you can cheat it out without a tribute using a Giant Rat after your opponent's last attack! Dream Clown was my alternative rat target and supposed to put me in a position to destroy any particularly large or dominant monster by switching it to def in my following turn.  Speaking of, the clowns were thrown back on the bench other than this one copy of Dream Clown. Crass Clown already had trouble competing in Metal Raiders format stat-wise and an even more offensively oriented meta would't be kind to it. His work partner Dream Clown still had uses, but none that justified running additional copied that could potentially clog up my hand. It would be easy to beat over even with equips but still had utility as a follow up with Rat, so one copy was just right.  Cyber Jar is just Dark Hole and a way to fill up your field or hand. It's an amazing card that usually gets you out of tough spots. Since we play on the Traditional F&amp;L list (with modifications done by the group as seen fit or when one player starts to dominate the field), the card was fair game. The consistency boost still is much appreciated. Don't set it on a neutral or good board state; it's the equivalent of throwing dice on the table and praying you roll all sixes.  Dark Hole, Fissure and Tribute To The Doomed just are more removal tools.  Even though giving your opponent 1k LP is so much worse in a slow-as-molasses Yugioh compared to modern standard, I still just enjoy playing 39 cards over 40. Consistency is key, and my decks need it badly given my lack of Pot Of Greed or searchers.  Paralyzing Potion still is the decent stun it also was in the week before and the other equips are just the best I got in terms of attack power. I went for the magic six as border for equips since they are only situationally useful at the end of the day, but should be usually on given my monster count. Wouldn't want to see more than one in an opener tbh; they clog your hand without any summonable monster.  The star of the week and by far my favorite card of this week was Tailor Of The Fickle, however. The card is super versatile and even more so with the absurd amount of variety in equips that were run in the group: It could be a watered-down Rush Recklessly (something I also failed to pull), effectively boost two of your monsters with one equip during the battle phase by activating Tailor after attacking with the equipped monster, shuffle Paralyzing Potions or Stim-Pack drops... The card was amazing and thankfully, most of my friends caught on in building this time. I used it in all of my games and usually had a pretty significant momentum shift in my favor everytime I resolved it.  Swords still enables tributes which only get better with Tailor and own equips.  Dual Mirror Force still is just broken at this stage of the game. Fun fact: Right after winning this week, we unanimously limited the card to one. Two of my friends also had it and we didn't want to inevitably hit those two as well. The limit hurt me and me alone, seeing as I am the only one in the group with more copies.  Spellbinding Circle was pretty much more a more consistent and reliable Paralyzing Potion. It was immune to Tailor Of The Fickle which made it a much safer bet than Paralyzing Potion for slowing a game down. It performed well this week but this will most likely be the last opportunity for that to be the case. The next set has Jinzo and much more S/T-removal.  The Extra still is just personal aesthetic preference and all part of a long-term scheme that will effectively hide any plans of using this portion of the game later.  The side was engineered to be a smokescreen into a degenerate burn/stall portion more true to what I played in the last weeks. I never used any of those cards - but one of my friends did. He almost kicked my butt since I had trouble getting anything going... But all monster advantage falters in the presence of Dark Hole. The smokescreen also had no cohesive plan: Do I want my opponent to attack and use card effects or do I want them not to attack? The cards point in both directions and kind of get in the way of each other. Go for better stuff than this! Even a side board of Remove Traps would have been better."

If going first, set as many cards as possible, and be as aggressive as you can during their turn. If going 2nd, a good strategy is to set both Solemn Strike and Fossil Dyna, then during their battle phase, use Fossil's flip effect to destroy their monsters, while Solemn Striking any effect that might protect them from Fossil.</li>  	<li>If going first and you have both Fossil and Boarder in your hand, always prefer to summon Fossil first, as preventing the opponent from special summoning in the first place is much more important than locking any of their monster effects (plus, if they special summon from the Extra Deck, then Inspector Boarder becomes way less helpful anyway).</li>  	<li>Don't be too greedy with Pot of Desires; if you're down to 20 cards already, and PoD is an option, think carefully before you take the risk of removing another 10 cards from play.</li>  	<li>Try to bait Ash Blossom with Pot of Desires first, then use Pot of Duality; the former gives you two random cards, but the latter allows you to pick one out of three, and that's more important in this build.</li>  	<li>Don't use Card of Demise if you've already summoned a monster, as if you draw another one with Demise, you'll have to send it to the GY at the end of the turn.</li>  	<li>If you can afford it, Pot of Extravagance (along with an Extra Deck) might be better option than Pot of Desires, since with it, you don't have to worry about losing your monsters. However, Extravagance doesn't work well with the rest of the draw cards (Demise, Upstart Goblin etc.), so keep that in mind.</li> </ul> Notes:  This build, or ones slightly different to it, have been tested from October 2020 up to this day. For an anti-meta build, it's adequately competitive, as I've had a decent win/loss ratio of 2.19 against much more competitive builds such as Shaddol, Salamangreat, Numeron, Eldlich variants etc. (not counting single duels or quitters in matches). I prompt you to give it a try for yourselves, and leave any feedback on the comments. :)"

This is deck #50 for me on this site (#52 actually, but never mind that) and it has been a journey indeed. I enjoy making decks/writing deck descriptions and posting them on this site and for deck number 50 I wanted to do something special! I decided to make an Atlantean Mermail list with an in depth description! Why Atlantean of all things? Because it is a really fun deck to play (in my opinion) and it is also considerable difficulty to play as well, so I will share my knowledge with you. This list also uses Retort Fusion (DAMA) and does not use the new level 5 Deep Sea Synchro since I feel like (from a lot of testing) that it is not needed or good in general. I really hope you enjoy this deck description and if you do make sure to like this post (here on YGOPROdeck) so that I know you want more like this. If this gets enough likes (10 or more) I will make more detailed deck descriptions!! My goal at the end of this article is to get you a solid understanding of how to play this deck on a competitive level. I highly recommend trying this deck out, not only is it very fun to play - It is also a strong deck. Well, without further ado, here we go!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you would like to look at the combos, feel free to check out my Youtube video - I explain all the deck ratios in there as well :)</span>  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3YypxgGiMs</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Intro and Credits</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Mermails were actually really good last year (both the VFD turbo and the hand loop variants) but if you think about it, as of now the deck has suffered a lot of hits such as Jet Synchron (pretty significant but can be replaced at a cost of not playing too many cards that are not water), O-lion (this is huge), linkross (made the deck more consistent but is not really needed otherwise) and VFD as well (end board monster you can make after looping 3-4 cards). This deck is inspired off of OCG lists that topped tournaments and also from some lists on youtube. Huge shoutout to </span><a><span>Shire</span></a><span> for some of the deck ratio numbers and combos! One thing about the ocg is that they still have O-lion, Jet synchron AND VFD as well (is at 1)!! This is an outrage! (They even have Colossus and a lot of other stuff we don’t and somehow that is fair). This list differs a little from the OCG lists and is more TCG focused but I assure you, it can still do some crazy things like before! This list can do both hand loops for 4-5 cards and set up 2-3 negates or even go in a full negate based path if needed. Keep in mind all the combos are Nibiru proof as well so that is 1 problem out of the way (that that nibiru! hahahahaha - sorry it's a combo player thing). </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Main Deck Ratios</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Atlantean Prince</b><span> - This is your main starter and can give you access to basically anything since you can mill Dragoons and search for another Dragoons using it’s effect. 100% have to maximize on it and it’s secondary effect is also good (monster reborn like effect if sent to GY) so it serves as an extender as well if drawn at multiple copies or with other normal summons. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Atlantean Dragoons</b><span> - Oh boy here we go! Literally all the cards with “Dragoon” in the name are insanely broken for some reason lol. This is your main searcher that gives you access to your entire deck (literally). It’s effect is not once per turn as well so it is the best thing in the world if you draw it. This is the best card in the entire deck hands down and if you are not playing 3 copies, I’m sorry to say but there is something wrong with you (sorry!).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Atlantean Heavy Infantry</b><span> - This card is great removal if discarded from the hand (basically a Zoodiac Drident) and can also be used to gain a Normal Summon. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Diva</b><span> - Another main normal summon card that enables huge combos and gives you access to your Atlantean Prince! Best starter in the deck and you need to maximize on this, very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Minstrel </b><span>- this is also an amazing draw and drawing it early lets you play through handtraps (I like to rub it into nibiru’s face - it makes me feel good) and get water monsters (like Dragoons) from your hand into the graveyard. Drawing it also enables you to search something else with dragoons to further extend plays (you search minstrel in some of the combos btw). </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mermail Abyssmegalo</b><span> - This guy is a little interesting. He does require 2 discards so I decided to play only 1 (some people play 2 but 3 is not recommended). It helps get water monsters in the GY and also searches for a trap as well. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Mermail Abyssgunde</b><span> - this is also an interesting card, it is used in the combos and is searchable but I opted to only play 2 copies instead of 3 because you will not always have a mermail in the grave (you are really not running that many) so I opted to play 2. Still a very important combo piece.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mermail Abysspike</b><span> - Again, just 1 copy since you can search it and because it is a normal summon (don’t want to open too many normal summons). Still a solid card that gets stuff into the GY and helps combos.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Mermail Abyssteus</b><span> - Here we go again! This card not only is an extender but it enables so many combos/plays and you NEED 3 of this like dragoons. It gets things into the Grave, special summons itself and even searches a mermail which is amazing! Extender and combo enabler all in 1!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord </b><span>- this card is insanely powerful, it can special itself from the hand and can also rip 2 cards out of your opponent’s hand!! Only one copy needed since it can be searched.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Fishborg Launcher</b><span> - Amazing card to summon with halq (it's basically a jet synchron) and is not a brick if drawn (can discard it and then it will resurrect itself). Some people are playing 2 of these but I decided to go for 1 because some of the extra deck monsters/main deck monsters are not water so you can’t use it’s effect.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Lappis Dragon</b><span> - This can be search with dragoon to go into synchro plays.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Aqua Spirit</b><span> - Amazing extender, also lets you get into bahamut shark easier so that you can end on an extra toadally awesome as an OMNI negate or for anti nibiru protection!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Sea Turtle Kaiju</b><span> - This is a form of removal. That is why I am only running 2 copies, since prosperity can dig for it if needed. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Swap Frog</b><span> - You need to play this because Froge best. Swap frog is an amazing extender which can help dump your cards into the Graveyard and also help in getting toadally awesome out! </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> - This is for Frog combos, and it is a brick you do not want to draw - you can simply discard it if you draw it. Playing this brick is well worth it because it can summon itself back from the graveyard multiple times generating so much advantage!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Deskbot 001</b><span> - Great Combo enabler, is kind of a brick when drawn, simply means a -1 (need to summon with halq from the hand).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Aria</b><span> - this card is literally insane, being able to search for almost anything in the entire deck, very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Retort Fusion </b><span>- This is the best extender in the entire deck, and it also allows Halq turbo to be possible in case you get hit with droll or something like that.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Abyss-sphere </b><span>- This is something you can search with Megalo, it helps to extend/pressure the opponent and is also used in the combo!! I’m running this instead of the Mizuchi equip spell because the equip spell only works if you have a mermail on the field and you don’t have mermails in your end boards a whole lot.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck Cards -</b>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>1x </span>Trishula, Dragon of the Ice barrier <span> - Great removal card (banishes from field and GY as well) and can also be used to handloop! This card I especially like in the handloop combo because it banishes from the hand (and 1 from the GY, can be one you looped earlier) so if you are going against a GY deck like eldlich, you can guarantee value!! Used in the combos as well btw.</span></b></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Deep Sea Prima Donna</b><span> - This card is literally insane, being able to special summon from the deck is insane and it is used in combos as well. It can also recycle banished cards (another thing to keep in mind).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Adamancipator Dragite</b><span> - This is a card you can make easily, it is generic spell/trap negate and is also a water monster in case you are locked after using Coral Anemone and whatnot. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Borreload Savage Dragon</b><span> - Ah, you gotta love a dragon link card, but this is actually a generic Omni negate, which can help your combos stay nibiru proof even after you return the nibiru you banished (with minstrel) to the opponent’s hand (with Prima donna). Great card to have in your end board, no arguments there!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Virtual World Shenshen</b><span> - This is another card you can have in your endboard (in the deep sea diva combo) and it is a Macro Cosmos! This card is Insane and you must play it!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Desert Locusts</b><span> - an extra hand rip you can summon with halq during your opponent's turn!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Crystron Halqifibrax</b><span> - Oh yeah, synchro deck? You need this guy, it's literally a law or something (except if you are playing Junk Speeder lol). This card also has another purpose in the deck other than just the tuner from the deck. Halq will be on our end board sometimes and you can use him to make Desert Locusts during your opponent’s turn for an extra handrip! (Insert maniacally laugh here)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Marincess Coral Anemone </b><span>- This card is a generic reborn and can be great for a comeback and that is why I decided to play it at 2 copies (you use 1 for the combo) just in case. It’s only downside is that it locks you to water only for the rest of the turn (keep this in mind!).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mecha Phantom Beast Arouradon </b><span>- This is to go into synchro plays and goes well with Halq (summons deskbot and now you have 2+ machines). Very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Sea Monster </b><span>- This guy is really useful and can be summoned off of Retort Fusion and it is also a water!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mistar Boy </b><span>- generic link 2 which can be used to OTK as well</span> <span> </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Accesscode</b><span> - OTK and for removal as well</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Bahamut Shark</b><span> - this card is so good, it can summon toadally from the extra deck and if you detach Dragoons to use it’s effect, Guess what! You get another search!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Toadally Awesome</b><span> - This card is insane, an Omni negate and if your opponent was using a staple, you get to eat it onto your field! This also makes the combos nibiru proof and when it’s sent to the GY, it can recycle a water to your hand which is HUGE because you literally mill all 3 dragoons in your first turn most of the time lol.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Well, that is all I have for this deck explanation, I really hope you enjoyed and even have a basic understanding of how to play this deck!

You going seconds because its likely they will be playing sweaty decks like blue eyes / dragon decks / meta decks where they will be playing so many cards to get stronger monsters out. you can literally say bye bye to those cards.</li>  	<li>Trishula, Zero Dragon is always your aim to get out, if it gets destroyed it activates a GY effect to special summon trishula to the field with atk of 3300 damage. A great way to keep your field with stronger monsters.</li>  	<li>If trishula is not possible, you have back up plans like White aura synch monster. For example Bihamut (Lvl 10 synchro), cheaper than trishula, can also special summon a token with 3300 ATK / 3000 defence into defence position each turn you do not control a token summoned by him, essentially meaning you have some block from taking damage. Use this time to get more ice barriers to get out the ""Trishula, Zero"".

This deck has 2 main strategies, the first one is to leave on board multiple interruption to your oponent like poping card on his field, and linking his special summoned monsters, and the second strategy is leaving a gryphon lock, putting him in the center of the field, making your oponent face a very strong floodgate, and also, with some interruptions, like the pop from Evil Twin Lil-la, so you can protect your gryphon even better from monsters like Pankratops.  In this video i show some replays where you can see the basic combos and some more advanced ones. I hope you guys enjoy the deck :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgzd9L_zXo"

Thirdly, All of these decks upon completion are made to be around or below 60$ including shipping, and yes i do use these decks hence why sometimes they are updated to make them better as they get playtested. Fourthly, these decks are generally not a mix of archetypes as its what i prefer.

In other words, we have to wait for an official release date. <a>https://mortalkombatpoland.splashthat.com/</a>  <a>AUstralia </a>  a slightly longer answer is that everything can probably be changed at short notice. Some other Warner Bros. movies have skipped theaters and gone straight to streaming. You can rent the thriller ""The Little Things"" on SF Anytime, and stream DC's big movie ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on HBO Nordic. These are titles shown on HBO Max in the United States. <a>https://mortalkombatukraine.splashthat.com/</a>  Other big movies like ""Godzilla vs Kong"" are waiting for their cinema premiere. But the strategy at Warner Bros. and SF Studios right now is to release ""Mortal Kombat"" in theaters as soon as possible, hopefully later this spring. <a>https://themarksmanukraine.splashthat.com/</a>  <a>https://nomadlandpoland.splashthat.com/</a>  Because it premiered on April 28th earlier, if I remember correctly. But how come the US runs the <a>movies</a> in theaters. Do they have different restrictions there now so that more than 8 people can visit the cinemas? Otherwise it should not be profitable for them to keep it open either, you think. In my hometown, however, the cinema is open. But there is hardly any point in them being open when no new premieres come. Now only a few films are shown that have already been seen because they have remained in the cinema for several weeks since the premiere <a>Stream</a>. And it is probably an animated film about a poodle and a Danish film with Mads Mikkelsen they are going to show at the moment. But for some it is not of interest until the film with Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland or Godzilla v Kong goes to the cinema. Then it's Cruella I hope for in May. And a little craving is also on Mortal Combat.  <a>https://primetimefilm.splashthat.com/</a>"

The main strategy is to win by burn damage through summoning as many Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragons as possible on turn 1. If its turn 2, you try for a beatdown strategy with Dragoon and other big monsters. Its nothing too crazy, can play through a few negates if you have enough extenders, but probably not meta enough to stand up against the toppest of tiers. Some cards can probably be removed to make it more powerful (red-eyes darkness dragon and among other cards) but I played them cuz I think their fun to summon sometimes. And finally, the side deck was thrown together, its probably bad. The deck's biggest weakness is definitely dark ruler no more since it'll shutdown your whole turn 1, and there isn't much you can do to stop that besides side-decking spell/trap negates. I'm open to criticism, I just don't want to change the strategy of summoning 3 Metal flare dragons on turn 1, since thats the whole reason the deck was made.  now that im done rambling, here is your main combo  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  <span><strong>Combos:</strong></span>  Turn 1: Black Metal Dragon + Any Level 7 (preferably a Red-Eyes) + 1 Discard 1. Summon Black Metal (normal or special, whichever you can do) 2. Make Striker 3. CL1 search for Boot Sector Launch CL2 Search for Darkness Metal Dragon (this may change order depending on whats in your hand) 4. Banish Striker to summon Darkness Metal 5. Special summon Black metal using Darkness Metal's effect 6. Make Romulus, CL1 search for Ravine CL2 Search for Red-Eyes Insight 7. Activate Ravine, and Discard 1 card, and Mill Absorouter 8. Search for Rokket Tracer 9. Activate Boot Sector Launch and Special summon Rokket Tracer 10. Activate Rokket Tracer and destroy your boot Sector launch to special summon Rokket synchron 11. Make elpy 12. activate Romulus to special summon the level 7 in your hand 13. make pitsy 14. using pitsy to special summon absorouter from your graveyard 15. XYZ into a Metal Flare dragon 16. Activate Red-Eyes insight, mill a Red-Eyes normal monster, and search for anything except red-eyes fusion 17. activate Metal flare and detach your level 7 to special summon the red-eyes in the graveyard 18. activate elpy to special summon tempest 19. XYZ into another Metal Flare Dragon  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  by now your board should be an elpy, a pisty, a romulous, and two metal flare dragons (one with 2 material and the other with 1). Your hand should be 2 cards and a red-eyes spell/trap Depending on what you have there are many routes you can go from here.  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  -If the level 7 was a red-eyes (or if you found some way to get extra red-eyes in the graveyard) 20. you can Link away pisty and elpy to make galaxy satelite dragon 21. then link away satelite and romulous to make predaplant verte anaconda 22. then activate your second metal flare dragon to detach Tempest and special summon a red-eyes from your graveyard 23. Activate tempest in the graveyard and banish pisty and elpy (or two other dragons doesn't rlly matter) to special summon itself 24. XYZ summon your third Flare metal dragon. 25. activate anaconda and special summon Dragoon 26. Set whatever card you searched for with insight 27. End your turn with 3 Metal Flare Dragons, A Dragoon, a Predaplant, Red-Eyes Spell/Trap with 2 cards in hand.  -If the level 7 was not a red-eyes 20. you can Link away pisty and elpy to make galaxy satelite dragon 21. then link away satelite and romulous to make predaplant verte anaconda 22. activate anaconda and special summon Dragoon 23. Set whatever card you searched for with insight 24. End your turn with 3 Metal Flare Dragons, A Dragoon, a Predaplant, Red-Eyes Spell/Trap with 2 cards in hand.  -If you don't want to or can't summon Dragoon at this moment in time (You require an extra red-eyes in the grave or an extender to do this) 20. Use your extender or Red-Eyes metal flare to get another level 7 or your Rokket synchron on the field 21. Link Pitsy/Elpy with Romulous to make Triple burst dragon 22. link Triple burst with elpy/pisty to link into Darkness Metal 23. Special summon either a level 7 or a Rokket synchron, depending on whichever you are missing 24. Synchro summon your level 7 and rokket synchron to make borreload savage 25. equip triple burst in your grave to borreload savage 26. End Turn with 2 Flare Metals, a Borreload savage, and a Darkness Metal  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  <strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>  the extenders in this deck will typically allow you to change up the combo a bit so you can consistently end on 3 Flare metals if you go uninterrupted, but if you are interrupted, you will usually end on 1 if there are a lot of interruptions or 2 if there aren't that many. There are more combos that you will probably just figure out exist when you see some of the test hands yourself. Such as using starliege instead of black metal dragon for a weaker but still effective combo, or using the rokket cards as your method of getting bodies on the board for when you don't have starliege or black metal dragon.  This deck is rlly fun in my opinion, But can struggle with comebacks or playing after your board gets broken, so don't over-extend unless your that sure your opponent won't break your board. If you have any suggestions, put them in the comments with an explanation of why, so I would actually make the changes on my personal deck list and for anyone else who reads them, I won't argue against your opinions or reply to any comments since everyone doesn't have to play the same way. Thanks for reading.  and yes I agree Red-Eyes Darkness dragon is a horrible idea and a bad card, I didn't wanna play a one of tech card."

Your main goal is to link summon Vampire Sucker, than use the vampire cards to tribute your opponents monsters while zombie world is on the field. Avendread slayer is usually used to get a vampire in the grave for a play, or to get Banshee in the grave for zombie world, then you make your tributing plays in main phase 2. This is definitely a casual deck, since it can't really play through a lot of negates and also has its biggest weakness being running out of zombie worlds. But overall still fun, I like vampire cards and the newest one can gain alot of advantage using vampire sucker. I'm not going to list combos since I don't really have any big combos, I usually just wing it with this deck.  If you have any suggestions for this deck without changing the core theme of Vampire  Zombie World, I'd love to hear them with a reason why."

This deck has a lot of draw power thanks to Spellbook of knowledge and Magicians'  Souls. You can look up any dark magician video (even a duel links video) to see 80% of the combos this deck uses. One combo you may not be familiar with is using Magicians' Souls with Magicians Restage to get a free monster for link summons, drawing 2 and a free spell negate via magician's right hand.  your main goal is to end on the classic dark magician combo with maybe a negate or two depending on what your able to draw. Obviously this deck isn't standing up against anything meta since im not summoning 20+ negates and this is at the end of the day a control deck. But its still fun to play if your opponent isn't playing anything meta.  <strong>Some Card's Purpose in the deck</strong>  imma quickly explain a few cards, -Magicians' Combination: I wanted to use dark magician girl for the soul servant bonus, and with the draw power this deck already has along with magicians' souls, getting a dark magician in hand/grave along with a dark magician girl isn't too hard. Plus its a continuous omni-negate  -Magicians Right Hand: I don't have dragoon any more to negate harpie's feather duster, or twin twisters, This along with magicians' combination and maybe a dark magician fusion through eye of timaeus is all we have as a counter to those cards. Plus Magicians Right Hand forces them to give up a spell if they wanted to wipe the board with a spell (assuming you have a spellcaster on the field)  -Grand Spellbook Tower: exists as an extra spellbook card to searh for when you use Crowly. If I drew any of the three spellbook cards, then crowley would be useless for the entire duel. I didn't like that so I threw this in here, and now I can go +1 in the standby phase if I used a spellbook card already (Which I probably will have). I'm also now able to recycle my spellbook cards to use later in the duel for more draw power.  -Triple Tactics Talent: I get ash blossomed alot, and I dont like it.  -Magician's Navigation: 90% of the time will be used as a discard, and will only be used on the field If im getting super unlucky and can't draw eternal soul.  -Dark  Magician Girl  Dragon Knight/Dark Paladin:  There is no excuse, I had no idea what to add, and I had an extra extra deck slot. So I was like ""Its a free discard i guess, might as well"" also follows the dark magician + dark magician girl theme. And Dark paladin is a massive beatstick against some decks so... yea replace this with whatever you want  -Palladiums they are in the deck to boost soul servant's draw power, and to use mahad as a searchable dark beat stick. if you draw them at a bad time, or in general, discard them. These are also the main cards you would remove for your side deck choices, they aren't essential for the strategy but they are useable against any deck.  <strong>Conclusion</strong>  Please don't be too harsh in the comments, I know the deck isn't perfect, I change it almost every week. But Still don't be afraid to give suggestions."

Now with the Despian Fusion Fieldspell card they are even consistent. Both archetyps are dark fairy so good synergy all in all. Try draw as many cards as possible till u have all the materials to fusion into something big. REMEMBER you can't special summon from extra deck after using ""Stigmatika Curtain Rise"" except fusion summoning.  Not so strong going first. Most of the time you will end on a Quaeritis an Dramaturgia.  Going second you can OTK most of the time. Use your field breaking cards like Super Poly (Tragedy is the perfect discard), The First or Zerato (not once per turn raigeki) to finish your opponent off with your beatsticks. Draglubion into Number 100 or The First + Delight/Quaeritis.  If you have any ideas for changes feel free to comment :)"

Our flourishing life will be the ruin of our opponent! >w< Es hora de mostrar el poder de la curación. Nuest,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Aumentar nuestros LP con Red Resonator y transformarlo en daño con Manipulator of Souls. &gt;w&lt;  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/JhZ0kBQgS5c &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que le afectan los incrementos de LP del oponente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

Using cards like Dragon Shrine and Dragonmaid Hospitality will set up your GY whilst Trade-In and Dragonmaid Sendoff set up your Hand and board. While you have enough big boys on the field, you can also summon the head Dragonmaid Sheou or some other monsters such as the various Galaxy-Eyes cards. The deck may be viable for higher play, but haven't been tested in that environment, so don't expect extremely crazy plays, just fun ones."

This is mainly accomplished through Toon Black Luster Soldier.  And even if ,"This deck focuses on summoning Toon monsters under the effect(s) of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>. These Toon cards can both destroy your opponent's cards with ease, but also be prevented from being destroyed themselves and even attack directly while under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>; a powerful double-edged sword that makes it easy to control the board!  The main card in this deck is <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a>, as it allows you to banish cards from your opponent' side of the field. It's best to summon him under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Toon Dragon"">Red-Eyes Toon Dragon, and </a><a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> as they allow you to special summon Toon cards while ignoring their summoning conditions!  It's fairly easy to get the materials necessary to start dominating the board early thanks to <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a>, <a data-name=""Teraforming"">Teraforming</a>, <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a>, and <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a>, as well as <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> as they allow you to continue cycling your deck and special summon Toon monsters from the deck or your hand.  However, this deck is most powerful when under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>, so it will almost always be vital to keep it on the board for as long as possible. That's why this deck also focuses on completely negating common counters to this deck (<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, etc.) through cards such as <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> and <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a>.  Another gimmick to this deck is it's ability to steal opponent's monsters. This can easily be accomplished by <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a>, but can also be done through <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. You can do this to both use your opponent's monsters against them in battle, or even be used to summon Link Monsters such as <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> that will continue allowing you to continue easily dominating the board.  <strong>Gimmicky Combos:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Using <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>'s effect that has you discard a ""Toon"" card, you can discard <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> (even if you've already played a <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> on the same turn) to have more defensive resources to protect your <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>.</li>  	<li>You can also use <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a> to take control of key monsters on your opponent's side of the field for Tribute, XYZ, or Link Summoning your own monster(s).</li>  	<li>Abuse the heck out of <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a>'s ability to keep <a data-name=""Toon &lt;a data-name=&quot;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&quot;&gt;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;"">Toon </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>(s) in your deck, as well as <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>s in your hand to keep summoning them!</li>  	<li>If you already have a god-like hand/board, but have a single <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> in your hand, you can use it to search for the other <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> in your deck until they're all gone, and use the final <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> to get a card you need! That way, you'll be more likely to draw other important cards in your deck that aren't Toon cards so that you can defend your <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom </a>(<a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, etc.)</li>  	<li>Use <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> to make your opponent summon a <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a>, <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>, or <a data-name=""Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> for you.

You want to go second with this deck so you can enter battle phase since all the equip cards has battle related effects. Then you have ""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"" which is one of, if not the best field spell for Normal Monsters in general. It allows you to have the Phantasm Spiral traps as hand traps, and can summon a token if your opponent is playing the game as long as you don't have a token (if your opponent gets rid of the token, you can summon it right back!). Next, we have the generic normal monsters/normal monster support, like ""Unexpected Dai"", which allows you to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower normal from your deck. Last but not least, we have the Normal Pendulum Monsters. Even though they are slightly unneeded for this deck, they are a great support tool.

With staple slots too, howwwwwWW","https://youtu.be/-z0hBP38KsU  Watch the combo in the video down below.  After several testing, the main deck Fleur monsters are just an ""okay"" Halqifibrax engine (at least Noble Knight Shield-Bearer is an Ash bait). So we need to play better Halq engine like Deep Sea/Atlantean because it plays through handtraps. We're not using Isolde as our monsters on field won't just be warrior alone, but beast (Horse of The Floral Knights) or beast-warrior (Centaur Mina). Only 1 Horse of The Floral Knights because we already run normal summon like Diva which does a better job than it. Lv3 synchro is there as we will have spare Diva if from Prima Donna search after using Minstrel, Baroness can revive Prima Donna after using the negate then we can make Baroness again using Diva+Neptabyss+Baroness via this lv3 synchro. Overall, it's just a worse Infernoble Knight because it lacks good built-in extender.

One, Thunder Dragons don’t use the normal summon whatsoever so that leaves it open for things like Gem-Knights who absolutely need their normal summon. Two, Gem-Knights have some thunder monsters and sometimes ask for a thunder monster, like a Thunder Dragon, as a fusion material. Three, both Gem-Knights and Thunder Dragon are fusion decks.  So I combined them... and made this! This is my first time working with this duo archetype so constructive criticism is helpful!"

This is not a meta deck, I've been playing dragons since Tyrant Dragon, now, this current format happens to make my deck more viable.  As such, this current format makes very viable to play different flavors of Dragon decks that uses Rokkets and Guardragons with favorable win rates.  I've just picked almost all my favorite Dragon-type monsters out of my binders and put them in a deck that performs decently at locals.  You may already know how Dragon-Link works, so I'll simply add these notes:  Black Metal Dragon and Starliege Seyfert are one-card combo starters that guarantee you at least a Dragoon and a Borreload Savage.  You may also use another extenders to summon an Apollousa before summoning the Guardragons in order to avoid getting Nibbed.  You can remove Beelze and add a 3rd Striker Dragon, a Hot RDA Abyss or Number 38 Hope Harbinger, a 2nd Hieratic Seal or an Unchained Abomination. However, Beelze can be difficult to out as it has some nice protection, it can't be destroyed neither by battle or effects, but can be targeted, thus get rid of in other ways.  I play 3 Rokket Tracer and 2 Rechargers because I have 3 Dark Synchros in the Extra Deck, but you can change those ratios if you plan to play other Extra Deck monsters.  The 3rd Rokket could also work as a wildcard if you plan to switch your Framegear combo with another handtrap trio while side decking. Or also, you can just simply add 2 Starliege Seyfert to play a 44-card deck, or you can replace one Rokket Tracer to play 2 copies of Rokket Tracer and 2 copies of Starliege Seyfert."

I discovered that There Can Be Only One is actually decent with this deck, and although it can hinder your plays it oftentimes hinders your opponent more, and you can link off for a knightmare if you want to. The Storming Mirror Forces are in there because the deck is even more fragile without dark ruler no more, infinite impermanence, and especially triple tactics talent, so if you end up stuck a mirror force can save you until the next turn, where hopefully you can go off. It might be a better idea to shave a desires for another mirror force, I'm not sure. I put in only one of the field spell and one terraforming for two copies of it. I hope you find this useful!"

Deck is still at 44 cards. It's nice having a few extra cards so that I have a better chance not drawing the obvious bricks.  I've taken out Ghost Ogre. I almost never saw it when I wanted/needed to. Even with Emergency Teleport.(Psychic Wheeleder and Tracker are the better targets) I've added in Stained Greives in Ogre's place.  I've taken out Nightmare Unicorn for Unchained Abomination. The spot isn't something I go into a lot. UA is an underrated card in PK IMO. It matches well with Rusty. UA is a card I need to test out more.  I've taken out Red Reboot for Imperial Order. I'm thinking of also putting in two Anti-Spell Fragrance.  I've decided to keep in the Artifact Package in the side deck. I stick by Rusty or Twin Twister to destroy Scythe during your opponent's turn, locking them out of their extra deck. Sanctum puts Scythe at four. Or, it'll give you Lancea if that's what will work best against your opponent.  Like I've said in my previous deck post, there are some very expensive cards. There are replacements for most of them. But the replacements won't obviously be as good as the listed cards.  Forbidden Droplets can be replaced with Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Chalice. Zeus isn't needed for the deck. It's used as a last ditch effort to wipe my opponent's board. Accesscode Talker can be replaced with Apollousa. I know Dragoon is expensive, but there's no good replacement for it. You can take it out entirely and add in some other cards in the main and extra decks that work well with PK.  If there's anything I'd change, it'd be with the choice of hand trap. Ash is a main stay. But Nibiru is still strong this format. It's hard to find room for Nibiru though. The deck I have is thought out and I want to keep it at what it is. That includes the side deck. I don't know what I'd even take out for siding in a couple of Anti-Spell Fragrance. I'm sure I'd be told to take out the Artifact package. But I like playing it.  &nbsp;"

So basically 8 negates + your opponent can only activate 1 s/t per turn. Very nice if you go second. I'd say you can get the 8 negate board about 60% of the time. You just need a way to special summon 2 Six Samurais + a counter generator like Temple or Dojo.  Link the 2 Six Samurais for Isolde  Use Isolde to search  Use Isolde 2nd eff to special summon one of the tuners  Link Isolde and tuner for Battle Shogun  Discard your Isolde search for Battle Shogun eff  Search Gateway.  At this point you should have 4 counters on your counter generator. Remove 4 to search Kizan.  Summon Kizan to link arrow pointed to be Battle Shogun to get 4 counters total on board  Remove 4 to search another Kizan  Summon Kizan to link arrow  Overlay for Shadow Shien to link arrow (You should have 8 counters after this)  Remove 4 to search Grandmaster  Summon Grandmaster to link arrow  Remove 4 to search Shinai (Make sure 2 of the counters are from Battle Shogun)  Link for Saryuja using Shadow Shien, Battle Shogun, and Grandmaster  Use Saryuja to summon Shinai (You should have 7 counters)  Remove 4 to search Mizuho  Summon Mizuho by its own eff (You should have 6 counters)  Remove 4 to search another Shinai  Summon Shinai by eff (You should have 5 counters)  Next use Mizuho eff using Shinai as cost to target itself and destroy it  Shinai eff to return the destroyed Mizuho back to hand  Summon Mizuho (You should have 8 counters)  Remove 4 counters to return Shinai from grave  Summon Shinai by eff (You should have 7 counters)  Repeat Mizuho's destruction effect to gain infinite counters or as much as you like. You get 2 counters each time you do it.  Once you get enough counters, summon 1 Kizan and 1 Grandmaster  Use Saryuja, Kizan, Grandmaster, Shinai, and Mizuho as 4 materials for Apollousa  Bring back Mizuho  Summon 2 Kizans overlay into Dugares  Special summon tuner from graveyard.  Use the level 1 tuner + Shinai + Kizan for level 8  Or Level 2 Tuner + Shinai + Mizuho for level 8  Summon Borreload Savage Dragon  Target Saryuja to equip to Savage Dragon.  IF your initial token generator was Dojo, you can remove it to special summon Great Shogun Shien from the deck  Now you have your board. There are more plays you can do. This deck is real fun!"

Fallen Paradise for the amazing Pot of Greed and protection of your sacred beast  Fallen Paradise will protect Raviel if you get him out.  Shimmering Scraper is for the OTK and for fallen paradise if you need a Sacred beast to draw additional +2 cards after your draw phase  Opening of the spirit gates can be easily used with Eldlich engine, with cursed eldland. Use cursed eldland to add Golden Lord and use Opening of the spirit gates to bring back a 0/0 monster by discarding Golden Lord, then use Golden Lord effect to bring himself to hand and special summon by sending the cursed eldland you used , and you can discard any golden land/ Golden Lord with cursed eldland 2nd effect.  Then since Golden Lord is a lvl10 on the field, you can use Opening of the spirit gates 3rd effect, to add Cursed Eldland from your GY to your hand.  Darkest Diabolos is an easy card to get out and makes your opponent send a card from their hand back to their deck.  Metal Reflect slime/ Egyptian God Slime can be used for rank 10 xyz spam....Fusion material to bring out Phantasm Emperor....to summon Shimmering Scapper (if needed for Fallen paradise) or just for flat out protection for your other monsters on the field.  Sacred Beast awakening has 4 effects. you are mainly using the +1 &amp;+2 effects and the last effect. +1 effect gives you life points if a Sacred Beast in on your monster zone, and each time your opponent summons/special summons, Gain life points equal to the monsters' attack. +2 sacred beast on the field basically ""skill drains"" your opponent side of the field and you still gain the +1 effect. The last effect states that if you have a lvl 10 (golden lord/Raviel/egyptian god slime) you can add a continuous trap from your graveyard to your hand. I usually add back Metal reflect slime since its an easy lvl 10 and can be recycled over and over again. Easy XYZ 10 spam and you can use Opening of the Spirit gates last effect to recycle a continuous spell card.  1 Greater poly is a great tech card since you do not want to banish everything with Dimension Fusion Destruction and gives the secondary effects to your fusion monster which is Phantasm Emperor (only needs 3 lvl 10's) which isn't protected under Fallen Paradise and the added extra effects goes will with that card. You can always Anaconda either fusion cards anyways so take your pick!  This deck kinda struggles with handtraps so theres +1 called by the grave, +3 gravediggers to deal with them.  The extra deck is mainly to either otk/burn your opponent  basic eldlich engine :  +3 Conq, +2 Hauq, +3 cursed, + 3 Scarlett, +2 Golden Lord  Basic Sacred beast engine:  +3 fallen(i like it at 3), +3 Opening, +3 Beckoning, +3 Summoning, +2 awakening and total of +5 Raviels  Thank you and let me know if you can make it any better!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Funny stuff,"Hand rip your opponent for 4 cards, or 5 cards with a revival spell.  Best way to learn scraps is by playing it yourself sense it's very awkward archetype to run by alone. Ending combos are fine, but starting is not always easy. You will have to find alternative routes with some hands, and no amount of pre built combos will help with that. So leave now if you don't like the idea of ""hard work"" or ""trail and error."" This other deck I made takes a bit of a dive into scraps (not much, but better than nothing), so you might want to check it out if you're starting off: https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-scraps-going-first/  I had a lot of inspiration from Infernites sense they have necromancer which basically does the same thing as Scrap Golem. So shout out StardustYgo's channel, the absolute Infernity master  Anyways, I lot of testing went into this. The hands aren't dead extremely often. While it can occasionally evade a hand trap, it has a hard time dealing with Nibiru if you don't draw into signs to force it out with a second hand rip pre-wyvern. That's why a small Dino package with Misc. provides a solid backup plan as well as protection from your opponent's Psy Gammas when starting off.  I'll probably come back to edit this and provide a more detailed explanation, until then, here's a video:  https://youtu.be/feNvZbUiMiU"

The whole point is to obviously summon Dragoon, Insight and Instant Fusion are there to help with that, Instant fusion to get out Thousand Eyes to hopefully steal what your opponent has then you normal summon any of the level 4 or lowers to get the Preda Link out to then get you Red-Eyes.  The traps are there to Special Summon Red-Eyes from the grave to then activate Inferno Fire Blast to deal either 2400 or 4800 damage as it's not once per turn.  The other in the extra deck or just there to keep things from going bad, Accesscode is very good at getting rid of an enemy Dragoon and the others for clearing the board.  I've entered many friend made tournaments with this deck and my friends hate how easy it is to summon Dragoon. You shouldn't really lose with it as long as you have Dragoon out and cards in your hand.  This Site won't let me class this as Meta but I'm sorry it clearly is."

The deck itself is fairly simple, to special summon Drytron cards then Ritual Herald out and get Vanity's Ruler out on turn 1 which is actually pretty easy, make sure you have at least 1 fairy card in your hand at all times to stop you opponent from activating anything with Herald's ability. Then once your opponent is locked out you can begin dealing damage, don't get too full of yourself and summon everything in your hand, you need those negates.  Use the field spell to get out Nova to then summon a Drytron from your hand, Delta is very good for draw power and Gamma will instantly get you the Drytron Ritual Monster out if you summon him correctly.  Honestly the Extra Deck isn't really necessary but will help you out in a tight spot, like linking to Unicorn or Pheonix if you need to get those numbers down in you've been Mystic Mined."

I made the experience that most of the time you end on 2-3 negates if you go first, so you absolutely need to know when to interrupt your opponent.  Cyber Dragon is one of the oldest, still viable decks. Because of this, we look at one of the archetypes with the most support, and there are many different builds to use for Cyber Dragons. The Fusion OTK builds are completely lost in modern yugioh, the trap variant just rolls over and dies if it has to go second and the combo build is really vulnerable to interruptions. I myself play Cyber Dragons since I pulled my first Infinity in the 2016 Mega Tins and tried probably all possible deck lists, including pure-light builds with Photon Sanctuary or Wattfox-Turbo, but most of these decks took a big hit due to union carrier getting banned.  This list wouldn´t even run union carrier, the Anaconda Verte is your go-to link monster, with several big targets, including Dragoon, the Cyber Eternity Dragon and the highly underrated Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Just remember that you can not special summon any more after using Vertes effect, but this is not important most of the times.  Depending on your starting hand, this deck has multiple lines of plays, just keep that in mind, these vary also depending on your matchup.  <strong><span>Main Deck</span></strong>  To start of with the monsters, this list uses 3 Cyber Dragons as you take advantage of the numerous Machine Duplication targets.  As for the mini-Cyber Dragons, you obviously use 3 Cyber Dragon Core and Herz as these are your starters, and as an option one Nachster,  as he is also a Duplication target. One of the best cards in this deck ist the galaxy soldier, I am torn between playing him at 2 or 3, as he is no longer searchable with Photon Orbital. If you need the consistency boost or are looking for a card to replace the expensive Pot Of Prosperity, this would be a fine addition.  The Jizukiru is a powerful option against any tower monsters and is searchable with Cyber Repair Plant. The handtrap lineup is heavily influenced by the fact that the galaxy soldier needs a light monster to discard. The Gamma is actually a very nice handtrap as it hits most of the meta decks, the Ghost Ogre is more of a personal preference, you probably should still run Ash Blossom.  The spell line-up has some inconsistencies to other lists:  The Overload Fusion is a great card in my opinion, not only does it allow access into Chimeratech Rampage Dragon who let´s you discard 2 light machine monsters from your deck (Herz and Core are great targets, in some cases Cyber Dragon himself or just to thin the deck) or pop backrow including your Cybernetic Overflow to search a spell/trap. Therefore, I run it at 3.  The Instant Fusion is a nice filler and generates a body for XYZ summoning one of your interruptions. Depending on the matchup and your starting hand, a Durendal sometimes has a bigger impact on the game, as you can force your opponent to pop your Cybernetic Overflow instead of another effect and then nuke his board with it.  The Emergency Teleport is a remnant of an old build which used level 7/8 synchros, as you can special the Gamma or the Ghost Ogre with it, and there are some nice targets as Dawn Dragster or Omega, but as long as ET is still limited this seemed too clunky. I liked the extra body or negate bait, just because you can use the Gh0st Ogre to go into Verte Anaconda (in some cases you can use it to special a ghost ogre on your opponents turn as it can be activated on the field as well, but I do not remember a single time I used this).  I only play one Pot of Prosperity, if you are not on a budget you should probably play 3 because you can banish 6 cards from your extra deck nearly all the time as long as you know which one you will need in your matchup. I simply do not own any more copies of this card up to this point, you could replace the Emergency Teleport and the Instant Fusion.  <strong><span>Extra Deck</span></strong>  As for some of the extra deck monsters, keep in mind that Cyber Dragon has some of the best removal with the Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, killing Apolloussa and other contestants for the extra monster zone with ease. The space here is very thight, so if you feel the need to add anything I recommend to cut the Pleiades or the Instant Fusion/Panzer Dragon.  The Cyber Eternity Dragon is not only a target with the Overload Fusion, but also can be special summoned by Novas third effect, which most people seem to forget all the time. It gets protection from used Chimeratech Rampage Dragons or Panzer Dragon, and can revive a Cyber Dragon from the grave if summoned with Overload Fusion. Note that Cyber Dragon Sieger is probably the best target during your opponents turn.  The Sieger is an interesting card and is the card that enables the OTK variant of this deck, but I use him rarely and mostly just if I draw an Overload Fusion, as he can double the Chimeratech Rampage Dragons ATK, who attacks three times with 4200 ATK, enough to run over most threats or kill your opponent quickly.  The Almiraj and the Linkuriboh are some of the most important enablers for this deck as they put your normal summoned monsters in the grave, allowing the Cyber Repair Plant to search either a Galaxy Soldier, a Jizukiru or a Cyber Dragon Nachster. They can later be used as Material for Anaconda Verte.  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  The Side Deck focuses on beating different matchups. You have more backrow removal because often times you would not get to a Rampage Dragon, the standard handtraps against Combo decks (""how often did you summon this turn?""), and the Super Polymerization against decks with big boards or other Machine Decks, as the Eternity Dragon needs generic machine monsters. I tried out a DNA-Operation Super Polymerization variant in my trap build, but it was too reliant on drawing those cards, maybe the Pot of Prosperity could help this type of deck out, but it would still lose most of the time if it had to go second.  <strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>  Cyber Dragon has some really strong lines and the Anaconda Verte opens up so much variance. The weakness to handtraps still is the biggest problem for the deck, but it should not be underestimated."

Dogmatika punishment can also be used to pop your own monsters if used with elder entity n'tss.  Kozmojo is just an amazing card giving you access to non-targeting banishment which can be an out to even red-eyes dark dragoon.  There can be only one does hinder your plays a little bit, though it isn't too detrimental to the deck as you'll more than likely have dark lady and maybe another machine on the field most of the time. Side it out at your own discretion.  Much of the sideboard is equipped to switch into a more banishing focused game plan, using cards like dimension shifter, different dimension ground, dimensional fissure, and macro cosmos to stun decks that rely heavily on the GY.  An honorable mention that I couldn't find room for was ""Back To The Front"" a normal trap thats searchable with trap trick can offer some much needed graveyard recursion if you arent playing the banish heavy strategy.  Having 2 sliprider can give you access to cyber dragon nova and cyber dragon infinity, giving you access to an annoying boss monster for the opponent to deal with, however rarely it might come up. It's still worth mentioning and running because the payoff infinity gives is so large.  Much like the cyber dragon lineup, dark destroyers give you access to possible rank 8 plays. I decided to go with hope harbinger, draglubion and numeron dragon. You can go into draglubion which can either summon hope harbinger for more disruption, or numeron dragon if you want to try to swing for game that turn."

You can tell that because Dragoon is crammed in there at the end just to make it all work. It is, however, surprisingly usable. There's a modicum of synergy between the three archetypes in play here--the Dangers can drop both Quants and Shaddolls from your hands to trigger their effects, and the Quants provide the attributes necessary to take full advantage of the various Shaddoll fusion monsters.  <strong>However: </strong>because of how the Dangers (and, to a less effect, Super Quantal Fairy Alphan) work, this deck runs on a bit of randomness. You can't always control <em>exactly </em>what's going to happen, and the inherent chance for everything to go wrong and stop working on a dime is what drives this deck into the strictly ""casual"" territory. This deck is a toolbox, not a combo machine; you make what you can out of what you have, and sometimes what you can manage to bard out <em>will </em>surprise you.  This doesn't stop the deck from being able to put pretty convincing boards up when everything <em>does </em>go right, though: El Shaddoll Winda is a forever-great floodgate and is impossibly easy to summon with Verte Anaconda.  Backing Winda up with quick-effect interruption from the Quant Xyz monsters, Dragoon, Dingirsu, or Number 38 can be pretty paralyzing--Winda plus even just one of these is a comfortable place to be in, in more casual/non-meta settings. And in the (VERY LOW) chance you manage to put Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus on the board next to something like Winda, you're gonna feel real smug.  The main appeal of this deck is, honestly, the novelty. This is probably the weirdest way to play both Quants and Shaddolls, and probably the worst way to do it that actually works. It's also still a work in progress--ratios still feel weird, especially with the Quants. Anyone who wants to take a swing at ironing out the creases in this honestly ridiculous Frankenstein, be my guest.  Full credit to HardLegGaming's <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Danger Dolls</a> deck profile for the inspiration, and basically half the decklist. It's also a way better deck than whatever I spat out here. Check it out."

I hope the card choices will help you build this deck by adding ideas.,"The pure version of Adamancipator focuses on getting the most value from engine cards and uses cards that are often overlooked like all main deck monsters and ""Adamancipator Friends"". Main deck hand traps are not only good for this format but also help synchro effects because they are of the Fire and Wind attribute. Book of Moon and Super Poly are versatile cards that are an interruption to your opponent's turn as well as cards that protect your monsters depending on the situation. This deck is definitely very competent at what it does and fun to play."

Dragon's Mirror is useful for getting Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon out and can be done whenever its drawn since Zombie World will make everything on the field a zombie. Royal Decree is helpful to defend against any traps that may prove to be annoying.  Aside from that, the monsters allow for a variety of different strategies to be utilized. Uni-Zombie and Gozuki are helpful for putting cards from the deck into the grave, which is a useful place to keep Doomking of Balerdoch and once per turn sending Glow-up Bloom to get access to  a lvl 5 or higher monster. Endless Decay is useful early in the game, but once opponent is no longer at max hp, it can be a helpful material for tribute. Il Blud, Zombie Master, and both Red-eye zombie monsters are helpful for special summoning from  either grave. Using the special summoning to get XYZ and Synchro monsters out is one tactic I tend to use."

First lets get to the main stategy is to summon  a Kaiju on your opponents side of the field, summon a Graydle, destroy it either through battle or through a card effect of a certain type and take control of it, If you don't have a Graydle in hand summoning your own Kaiju will do fine as well.  Each of the 3 main Graydles can be destroyed in ways other than battle.  Graydle Eagle can be destroy by a monster effect, preferable with Graydle Slime, allowing you to take control of it. If you set this card on the field you opponent will most likely try to destroy it with a monster deck especially if they don't know what kind of deck you're playing, this will disrupt their plays unless they have a way to negate it.  Graydle Alligator can be destroyed through a spell effect preferably with Graydle Impact or Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. If you use interrupted while the field spell is active summon Gameciel on your side of the field and any other Kaiju on your opponents side, Graydle Alligators effect will active allowing you to take control of your opponent's Kaiju and it will immediately be destroyed, this will generate 4 Kaiju counters allowing you at least 2 negates.  Graydle Cobra can be destroyed though trap effects which is where Graydle Split comes in, unless you opponent is running battle traps like Mirror Force which even then they most likely wont activate unless you have another monster on the field you most likely will be destroying it through battle.  Graydle Slime &amp; Slime Jr. are your tuners so they're required to make synchro plays.  Graydle Slime can be special summoned by destroying 2 Graydle cards you control, this includes spells &amp; traps so you can destroy Gradle monsters equiped to monsters you control, after that you can special summon a Graydle from you graveyard to set up a synchro summon. If you destroyed Graydle Eagle while it was in the main monster zone you can take control of a monster your opponent controls as well to use yourself as well as clear their field.  Slime Jr. can special summon a Graydle from your graveyard and then one from the hand of the same level, though be aware that if you activate his effect you will only be able to summon Graydle Dragon &amp; White Aura Whale though synchro summoning for the rest of the turn.  For the Kaijus they each have useful effects if you have the field spell out.  Dogoran can clear your opponents field of all their monsters at the cost of 3 counters, Gandarla can halve the ATK of all other monsters on the field on a quick effect for 3 counters, Gamaciel gets a non once per turn negate for 2 counters, &amp; Jizukiru can negate any effect that targets one card on the field and destroy it on a non one per turn quick effect, be aware that your opponent can use these against you. Mecha-Dogoran can remove 2 counters once per turn and equip a Kaiju from your hand or graveyard and gain ATK equal to that monster, I pretty much only have it in this deck so I can have another level 8 for synchro plays, so you can replace this one if you want.  For the spells Graydle Impact is useful for destroying your opponents cards or search out Gradyle card during the end phase. You can also use on Gradyle Alligator to make your opponent go -2 if the have a monster.  Interrupted Kaiju slumber will clear the field of monsters, special summon 2 Kaijus on both sides of the field and force them to battle. As mentioned before, if used in combination Graydle Alligator, you will clear your opponent's field of monsters. You can also use it's graveyard effect during your next turn to search another Kaiju.  Lastly Terraforming will help you search the field spell.  For the traps Gradyle Split will boost the ATK of on monster you control by 500 but it's main purpose is destroying one of your monsters and then summoning 2 Gradles from your deck so you can synchro summon. If used with Graydle Cobra you can take control of one of you opponens monsters as well.  And finally the trap Graydle Parasite will summon a Gradyle from your deck during your opponents battle plase and make them think twice before attacking. during your battle phase if your opponent has no monster ,but there's a monster in their graveyard that you want for your self, you can special summon it to their field and then crash into it with a Graydle to take control of it.  Now for the synchros, the main boss monster of the deck is Graydle Dragon, if summoned you can target and destroy cards your opponent controls up to the number of Water monsters used to summon it, which will be 2 if you used Gradyle Slime &amp; 3 if you use Slime Jr. If it's destroy you can summon a Water monster from the Graveyard with it's effect negated which won't matter for any monter in this deck aside from White Aura Whale's piercing damage.  Speaking of White Aura Whale it has a non cost Lightning Vortex effect when synchro summon &amp; can make 2 attacks on your opponents monsters with piercing damage. It's other effect will cause it to revive itself as a synchro turner by banishing a Water monster from the grave if it's destroyed by your opponents cards, which is where the Kaijus come in. If Gandarla is on your side of the field and you have enough counters, I recommend crashing White Aura Whale into a monster with higher ATK and chaining Gandarla's effect to it's revival effect. This effect will help summon 2 other synchro monsters.  Leo can be summoned using a level 8 monster and Slime Jr. Your opponent won't be able to target it outside your main phase 2 and will have a hard time beating over it due to having 100 more ATK than average for a level 10.  Star Eater can be summon by using a revived White Aura Whale and a level 3 Graydle, Your opponent won't be able to negate it summon with something like Solemn Judgement. It will also be unaffected by your opponents card effects until the end of the Damage Step  while it's attacking.  Final Sigma can be summoned using Jizukiru &amp; Slime Jr., It is unaffected by card effects outside it's archetype while in the extra monster zone which will protect it from Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. It also does double battle damage while in the extra monster zone, so I would not reccomend summoning more than one.  Finally the strongest monster in this deck is Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin, you can call it an bonus boss monster. This can be special summoned using a revived White Aura Whale and a level 8 monster. It can not destroyed by card effects and can summon the same number of tokens on both sides of the field on a spell speed 2 effect gaining 1000 ATK for each monster on the field and easily going up to 10000. You can summon a Kaiju on the opponents side to ATK for game.  That's my version of the Graydle Kaiju deck, feel free to make adjustments to it if you wish.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Raptor's favourite cards like King Rex, Serpent Night Dragon are a must. I added almost every single monster he used, the exceptions are Sword Arm of Dragon (too weak), Tyrant Dragon and Kaitoptera (anime card). I tried my best to stick with the old school theme and Rex.  8 normal level 1-4 monsters + 8 effect level 1-4 monsters: Basic normal monsters Rex used against Joey, and some new cards. Aside Gilasarus, Black Tyranno and Giant Rex, Rex Raptor did not use a single effect dinosaur monster, so I added some new dinos to power up this deck.  3 normal level 5-12 monsters + 3 effect level 5-12 monsters: Megazowler or Sword Arm of Dragon? It's a coin toss between them, I did pick Megazowler because of it's ATK. Ancient Dinobeast and Sauropod Brachion are optional cards, you can use Ultimate Tyranno, Superconductor Tyranno or Dark Dryceratops if you want to. Frostosaurus is an old cards, but it's remains one of the best level 6 normal monster out there."

It's too weak, even running 2 copies of Legendary Ocean I think it's not worth using it. Also the Aquabizarre Dragon is clearly based on Kairyu-Shin. So, I added 8 normal level 1-4 monsters (classic cards), and 8 effect level 1-4 monsters (most are recent cards, but nothing too OP). Fortress Whale, Legendary Fisherman and Amphibian Beast are must cards for this deck, and the other high level monster are level 5, because the main strategy of this deck is to use The Legendary Ocean effects in order to summon the level 5 monsters. Mixing old and new cards is a difficult task because I like to stick to our main theme (old school and Mako), so I tried me best to give this deck an original and old school touch.  . I didn't add Legendary Fisherman III because he's too OP, and that's not the purpose of this deck;  . You can use Kairyu-Shin, Giga Gagagigo, or Plesion Mecha Dragon and replace Aquabizarre or Salmon;  . Uminotaurus, Gilman, Blue Breaker and Warrior of Atlantis provide basic support, and they are not broken cards;  &nbsp;"

First, you want to pull a lot of monsters. This lets you summon from your deck if you have at least 1 spellcaster and 1 earth, fire, wind, or water type card. The main goal of the deck is just increasing the attacks of your spellcasters and inflict piercing damage if possible. That will mainly just help with the overall win condition since it's not really a strong deck.  Have fun!"

Unfortunely, most old normal insect monsters are very weak, so I needed to add Basic Insect, Kamariki, etc. I also added 2 copies of Neo Bug plus 2 copies of Kamakiri #2 because this deck needs some good normal monsters. You can replace one of them with Gokibore, Komotooko, Killer Neddle, etc. Just pick the ones you like the most.  <strong>8 Effect Level 1-4 Monsters;</strong>  Pinch Hopper is one of the hearts of this deck. It will allow you to summon Insect Queen, Mother Spider, Hercules Beetle, every single high level monster from your hand not named Perfect Ultimate Great Moth. Cross-Sword Beetle gives you a nice support by allowing you to inflict piercing damage; Spyder Spider and Aztekipede are nice cards to have on your hand, since they give you some options. As you can see, these monster have random effects, since I'm not making a deck foccused on archetypes. This deck is casual. Also Weevil used a lot of effect monsters against Joey and Yugi (orichalcos arc), but they are too weak. You can use Flying Kamakiri #1, but keep on your minds that it only allows you to summon WIND monster with 1500 ATK or less. Most insects on this deck are EARTH, so I'm giving you an advice - don't use flying kamakiri 1!  <strong>6 High Level Monsters;</strong>  Wheret he fun begins. Hercules Beetle, Perfect Ultimate Moth and Insect Queen are Weevil's cards, so I added them. Hercules is a joke, but this is a casual deck I use against my friends in real life, so whatever. Mother Spider and Mantis are your other level 5-6 monsters, they are not broken and you can use them. Hundred-Footed Terror is an amazing-but-not-broken card, it can save you in some situations. On overall, these are the high level monster I like to use on my Weevil Deck. You can use the Metamorphosed Insect Queen is you want to, you can replace Hundred-Foot Terror with her. Theren's no reason to run Great Moth, but you can use Armored Bug, since it's a very strong normal insect monster.  <strong>20 Spells and Traps;</strong>  Just random support. Forest, the equip cards Weevil used against Yugi (Duelist Kingdom), and of course Cocoon of Ultra Evolution is one of the best cards of this deck. It's a new card, very recent, I know it. Howerver, running the old cocoon of evolution plus petit moth is pathetic, because they take too much time to summon the moths. Some traps and some spells are foccused on insect monsters as you can see."

Psychopompos and Retort Fusion,"<span>Deck goes first of course. With DAMA coming out in the near future, we get cards that give zombies some new tools and cards that give back power that was lost over the course of time due to the banlist. With the introduction of <strong>Halq</strong>, zombies had a better way of sending<strong> Glow-up Bloom</strong> out of the deck and into the grave, but as <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> was limited, not only did we loose quick tuner access, we also lost a way to ensure that our plays always go through turn 1. <strong>Psychopompos</strong> is a nice alternative to summon off of <strong>Halq</strong> and its unique effect gives it a place in the deck alongside<strong> Jack-o-Bolan</strong> as he helps to banish<strong> pompos</strong>.</span>  <span>Maindeck is 3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 3 <strong>Belle</strong>, 2<strong> Doomking</strong>, 2 <strong>Banshee</strong>, 1<strong> Jack-o-Bolan</strong>, 3 <strong>Solitaire</strong>, 3 <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong>, 2<strong> Mezuki</strong>, 1 <strong>Gozuki</strong>, and 1 <strong>Glow-up Bloom</strong>. And we are also playing only 1 <strong>Psychopompos</strong> since he is a soft garnet in the same way <strong>Bloom</strong> is. You can decide to play <strong>Dangers</strong> or someother kind of free special summon as you want link material for <strong>Halq</strong>,<strong> Sucker</strong>, and <strong>Yuki-Onna</strong> but for this deck, we are getting there via <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> and the 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong>.</span>  <span>Spells/Traps: 3 <strong>Zombie World</strong> which is just an insane floodgate. 3 <strong>Super Poly</strong> which is interruption for turn 2 since this deck cannot break boards that well even with side deck cards and you want to prevent any attempts of your opponent making an interruption. 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for <strong>Millennium-Eyes</strong>. 3 <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> which summons the best monster of 2017 WHICH IS A ZOMBIE BTW. 1 <strong>Foolish</strong>. 3 <strong>Cyclone</strong>. 3 <strong>Rivalry</strong> for the interaction with <strong>Zombie World</strong>.</span>  <span>ED: 1 <strong>Mad Golden Lord</strong>, 1 <strong>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>, 1 <strong>Dragostapellia</strong> (which is a use for the <strong>Dragonecro</strong> sitting on your board or to out<strong> Dragoon</strong>), 1 <strong>Theseus</strong>, and 1 <strong>MER</strong>. 1 <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> as another way to banish <strong>Psychopompos</strong>. 1<strong> Omega</strong>. 1<strong> Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong> which negates all of your opponent's banished monster effs and is literally 2 negates every turn. 1 <strong>Avendread Savior</strong> which is a <strong>Foolish</strong>. 2 <strong>Sucker</strong> for the draw power. 1 <strong>Halq</strong>. 1 <strong>Phoenix</strong> and 1 <strong>Linkuriboh</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck: 2 <strong>Golden Lord</strong> for removal going second. 3 <strong>Sword Master of the Bewitching Iris</strong>. Zombie games will be dragged out pretty long if your opponent wants to dig for the <strong>Zombie World</strong> or <strong>Rivalry</strong> out so having something that can help you end games quicker during that process helps (and its literally a free summon thanks to <strong>Jack-o-Bolan</strong>). 1 <strong>Pank</strong>. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 3<strong> IDP</strong> which is funny with <strong>Zombie World</strong>. 3 <strong>Broken Line</strong> which I've never heard of until Pak brought it back up. Games are dragged out and having an omni-negate that can be used to slowly break boards is very useful.</span>"

I think the decks biggest enemy is something like altergiest, as they have lots of ways to get the other cards out, and then put alot of negates on the board. ive played around altergiest only once, but it was a best of three match so i lost.... but this deck still puts up a fight.  iguess you should really consider this deck  charmer fur hire melffys deck, cause it runs more fur hire cards then it does shaddolls. i run fur hire mainly because most of the monsters have the attributes that are used by the spirit charmers (earth, wind, water, and fire). they do have really cool effects though, all of thm can ss anther one during your main phase. it helps to get more peeps on the board to link away for anything really.  i didn't add the side deck in, but you should put cards like ash and nib to help u out when you face something that gives the deck a real problem (a.k.a altergiest)  anyway though, have fun with it!"

However, you can replace one of the high level monster and run 1 copy of Desperado Barrel Dragon or run both them (the old and the new Barrel Dragon).  <strong>3 -</strong> I added 8 normal monsters and 8 effect monsters. Most of them are DARK machines because the Spider needs dark machine monster to activate it's effect. However, I thought it would be unfair to leave Robotic Knight, Bugroth and Guardian of the Throne out of this deck. They deserve a spot. Every single normal monster is an old school one. Bandit Keith didn't use a lot of effect monsters (if I'm not mistaken he used Barrel Dragon, Blast Sphere and Machine King, but that's it), so I added some.  <strong>4 - </strong>3 high level monster are classic ones (Pendulum Machine, Barrel Dragon and Machine King) Keith used in the anime. The other 3 monster I thought they'd fit the theme of this deck, since they're dark machine monsters, and one of them has an effect that is about tossing a coin. You can use Launcher Spider and/Slot Machine and replace the Pendulum Machine and/or other non classic monster if you want to.  <strong>5 - </strong>Spell and Traps are cards keith used in the anime. I'm not running 3 copies of 7 completed because I think it'd be too much. As you can see I tried to remain loyal to our machine theme here.  I hope you all enjoy this deck. It's not OP, but it has some power. I love these decks that use old and new cards together."

One of the best rogue contenders this format due to it's ability to play a lot of board breaking cards, as well as being able to play the arguably the best hand trap against the current meta without being hindered by it at all, in fact it benefits massively from it (read on if you have guessed what the card is).  There are ultimately 2 win conditions that the deck has. The first is simply banish enough cards and summon Gren Maju to swing for massive damage and the game. With cards like Gizmek, Golden Castle, Pot Of Desires and Eater Of Millions being such amazing mass banishing cards this is a fairly acheivable goal.  &nbsp;  The second win condition relies on being able to use the Rank 8 package as well as the board breaking cards to either force a win via Draglubion/Numeron Dragon, or put them in a position that they cannot claw back due to the immense resources they have exhausted. The main deck features 11 Level 8's (and 1 in the extra) to achieve this goal. The Danger package acts as a triple threat. They can act as big beatsticks, removal cards and pseudo draw cards. Hex Trude acts a beatstick and a removal card and Gizmek acts as a deck thinner, Gren Maju feeder and removal card all in 1. Combine the 11 main deck level 8's with Glife, Golden Castle and Pot of desires you effectively have half a deck of level 8's.  The hand traps are easy to explain. Ash is there as it's a generic hand trap that can hit anything I wish, and is particularly useful when preventing Eldlich from hitting field via Sanguine. Nibiru is there because combo decks such as Dragon Link and Tri-brigade have really cone back into being  with the banning of Calamaties. And finally Dimension Shifter..... If you're deck isn't particularly graveyard centric or benefits from banishing, you play this card. See how quick this stops the meta dead. Literally a game ender in it's own right.  &nbsp;  The remainder of the cards are simple. Raigeki is there to push through Tri-Brigade and Dino's (most players summon Dolka over Laggia due to 2 monster negates being arguably more effective on the current format) without sacrificing the OTK if using Dark Ruler and cards with Forbidden Droplets. It's also fairly useful against Zoodiac Drident, AA Sky Zeus e.t.c. Harpie's Feather Duster to blowout control decks, Super Poly is just nuts thus format and reborn to bring back whatever you want.  The extra deck consists of super poly targets, N'tiss because Dogmatika is still a thing, Rank 8 package of Dingirsu for non targeting removal, recovering a banished Gizmek and field protection. Sanaphond stops graveyard centric decks from special summoning from the grave snd Dragubilon, Numeron Dragon and Hope Harbinger for the OTK. AA Zeus is there if you cannot quite OTK and need something to disrupt an opponents attempt to fight back. A simple Knightmare package and BLS round off the extra deck nicely.  &nbsp;  Side deck. Phantazamay is there for Tri-Brigade/Dragon link, as i really do want to see my board breaker cards against these decks and Phantazamay by drawing extra cards and targeting protection too. Lightning Storm effectively acts as an extra 3 copies of Raigeki/Haripe's. The traps consist mainly of floodgates. TCBOO to really cripple predominantley monotype decks, Imperial Order to prevent Invoked/Shaddoll packages and also preventing floodgate removal via Twisters or Cyclone. Macros Cosmos banishes everything, so is highly effective against combo and control decks such as Eldlich alike. Dimension Ground is an additional nasty against combo as is not as vulnerable to S/T removal as TCBOO. Red Reboot to shutdown control decks for either an OTK or mass trap blowout.  Feel free to rate/comment.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Cyberdark cannon can help search for the cards that are needed to summon cyberdark dragon and cyber emergency/repair plant can be a staple in searching for cyber dragons to get to Cyber End Dragon. Be careful of using your spell cards a lot because Cyber Dragon Zwei needs a spell card to be shown to your opponent in order for its name to be Cyber Dragon. Cyber Network is another good card to search the deck for Cyber Dragons and eventually Cyber End Dragon. The available fusions cards are the newly released Greater Polymerization in which allows the fused monster to deal piercing damage but it can save the monster from being destroyed by card effects. Another powerful fusion card is power bond in which can boost Cyberdark End Dragons attack points to a whopping 10k.

SS are not a super competitive archetype, but are they fun? HELL YEAH!","This version mostly tries to stick to just SS with a few tech cards, such as the Kaijus to work with battleball. I run 5 of them as there isn't really a coherent way to get them into your hand, except by drawing them. The deck does lack some drawpower, so if that's your idea, maybe try the SS pendulum who lets you draw by tributting itself, or a geargia engine (3x Geargiauger 1x Geargiaccelator) that helps turbo into Gear Gigant X more often for consistency and good search (i say maybe cut 3 magnet and 1 soulfiresuit). I was thinking of adding 1 geargiano to allow X to get off his final effect (trust me, he's never around for long), but maybe that's a bit too much deviation from the deck's playstyle. I do like my protection, so that's why i play 2 flutist and 3 soulfiresuit. You ALWAYS want a soulfiresuit in hand to protect yo shit! Gotta sit on that thicc booty. Most of the time, big benki is only summoned out from the grave via scarecrow, or flutist if you're in that situation so i run just the 1 of him. I do like the 1 fist as it gives you a constant tuner that can keep coming back, granted you've protected your synchros, but it's only a once per turn, hence the 1 copy. Also, 3 scarecrows are a must imo, as there are many times when I've almost gone through all 3 in a duel, he never stays around that long either. Him and soulpiercer are the bets wombo combo starter in the deck, so u gota get the most out of em.  Any tips or advice on how to improve the deck further is always appreciated.

The Artifacts are actually an archetype and not JUST an engine? Impossible!!,"So, this is another non-meta fave of mine. It's good if you want to play a deck with unique mechanic and give your opponent a chance to play the game, then you both can have some fun. Shock horror, I know.  But aside from that jest, the deck itself is fairly decent. It can brick sometimes and the archetype itself does need more support, but the way it works right now seems fairly solid. Moraltech and Sythe are fairly self explanatory. I play the 1 Beagalltach to act as the 4th Vajra, and the main way your gonna get some solid recursion from the grave is with Failnaught and BTTF, which also pairs well with Trap Trick. I then play the Achilleshield and Aegis to protect yo shit when u summon em during ur oppenents turn. They aren't that beefy so u gotta protec those dudes somehow. I originally was playing an extra Achille, but had to cut it and an MST for 2 BTTF for the more late game plays. Speaking of MST, they act as your extra 2 copies of ignition. The deck needs more ways to pop off and trigger itself (a field spell pls Konami) as otherwise...you're pretty fucked. Aside from that, Breakthrough skill is a poor mans infinite impedance and BTTF I've already mentioned. Track trick just helps with consistency and getting a 1st turn sanctum and then go off.  To help with the deck, I recommend an engine that uses a strong normal summon, as you don't really use that at all during your turn. For draw power, you could use a spellbook one, but I prefer to be able to go into the Artifact Link monster, Dagda first turn. It helps u get the artifacts u need during ur opponents turn and revive a fallen one when it dies (which it probably will with that weak ass attack). Ideally the scrap engine is much better giving access to synchros and more cool combos with accesscode talker, but as scrap raptor does not exist in the tcg and trickstars are kinda dead right now with their field spell at 1, the next best thing is Evil eye. It works quite similar to the previous 2 engines and does help mill itself out of the deck with Basilius sending it's own field spell, so once you've used it, you're not running the risk of drawing them later which is kinda neat. Wish the field spell was as good as the Trickstar one, being able to lock down pesky traps/spells is always nice. Try experimenting with different engines and see what happens tho,  Welp, there u have it. My pure Artifact deck. As always, any feedback or tips you guys have is always appreciated. But I gotta dash, hope you guys enjoyed."

barrier (lv 4). normal summon revealer first and special summon speaker then activate revealer effect discard 1 card special summon defender of the ice barrier (lv 3) then synchro summon using those three to summon trishula, zero dragon of the ice barrier(lv 11). if you got the first turn then synchro summon white aura dolphine (lv 6) instead using revealer of the ice barrier (lv 4) to special summon cryomancer of the ice barrier(lv 2) or normal summon cryomancer then special summon speaker. white aura dolphine (lv 6) when destroyed and sent to graveyard can special summon itself from graveyard by banishing 1 water monster then this card is treated as a tuner so you can just normal summon lv 2, or lv 4 monster then synchro summon both of it to summon your  white aura whale (lv 8), or white aura bihamut (lv 10). there is a bunch of lv 5 or higher monster support monster in this deck the best way to summon them is  using zuijin of the ice barrier, normal summon zuijin then activate its effect tribute zuijin to special summon lv 5 or higher mosnter from your hand the best target would be general grunard of the ice barrier (lv 8) because it effect allow you to normal summon 1 card per turn (in addition of your normal summon) so you can normal summon more card to synchro summon your extra deck. next best target to special summon is general gantala of the ice barrier (lv 7) you can use its effect to special summon monster card from your graveyard allowing you to recycle your card which mean more synchro. for recycling card from your graveyard you can use effect of prior of the ice barrier to tribute it self to special summon card from your graveyard. you can special summon prior of the ice barrier if you control another ice barrier card on the field but do not do it because if prior special summoned this way you cant special summon lv 5 or higher monster for the rest of the turn which mean limiting your self. this deck dependencies on sychro summon is massive so there is bunch off support card included on this deck. you can use magic triangle of the ice barrier to special summon card from your hand. medallion of the ice barrier, wind over the ice barrier or moray of greed to search card from your deck to either special summon it, add a card to your hand or draw more card. last you can use freezing chains of the ice barrier, monster reborn or torrential reborn for recycling your card. you can use general wayne of the ice barrier (lv 5) to search spell or trap card you needed using its effect to special summon it self it you control another ice barrier card on the field then add 1 spell or trap card from your deck to your hand (you can also activated this effect by normal summoning it) . for extra deck card there is two type of card to use depending on situation for support glacial beast iceberg narwhal (lv 7) can negate trap card effect during battle phase, number 37: hope woven dragon spider shark (rk 4) and white aura dolphine (lv 6) can reduce enemy monster attack point, brionac, dragon of the ice barrier or gungnir, dragon of the ice barrier to either return card from your opponent field to hand or destroy them, or you can just use your low level monster to synchro tatsunoko (lv 3) to sychro summon monster using this card as a tuner and 1 monster in your hand as material. you can only use cryomancer of the ice barrier (lv 2) and ice barrier token generated by banishing speaker of the ice barrier (lv 4) in your graveyard. with this combo depending on lv material in you hand you can synchro summon lv  7, lv 8,or lv 10 monster from your extra deck. as an addition there if few beatdown stick card if you want to aim for otk like sea dragon lord gishilnodon (lv 5) atk 2300 (can up to 3000),  white aura whale (lv 8) atk 2800 can attack twice per turn dealing piercing damage, white aura bihamut (lv 10) atk 3300 can generate 1 divine dragon token (lv 10) atk 3300, or trishula, dragon of ice imprisonment (lv 9) atk 2700 you can special summon it from your extra deck by banishing 3 monster with different name (any level or type) this desk main weakness is vulnerable to enemy disruption and backrow card there is a few support card to help alleviate this weakness such as medium of the ice barrier (lv 7) limiting enemy to 1 spell/trap card per turn, general raiho of the ice barrier (lv 6) make enemy discard 1 card to activate effect monster otherwise the effect is negated, daisojo of the ice barrier (lv 6) proctect your monster from backrow , dance princess of the ice barrier (lv 4)

The ideal hand is as follows: <ul>  	<li>Opening of the Spirit Gates</li>  	<li>Dark Beckoning Beast</li>  	<li>Dark Summoning Beast</li>  	<li>Chaos Summoning Beast</li>  	<li>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</li> </ul> First, activate Opening of the Spirit Gates to search for one of the Sacred Beasts (I suggest Raviel since it requires 3 fiend type monsters which is more restrictive than the other two).  Next, summon Dark Beckoning Beast to the field and activate its effect to search for one out of the two remaining sacred beasts (from this point I would suggest hamon since Uria needs continuous trap cards in the graveyard to determine its attack points). After that, use Dark Beckoning Beast other special ability to make an additional summon and tribute Beckoning for Dark Summoning Beast. Now, use Dark Summoning Beasts special ability to tribute itself and summon Raviel to the field. From the graveyard, activate Summoning Beasts ability to banish itself and add the last sacred beast.  Since you have Raviel on the field, which is a lv 10 monster, activate Spirit Gates other affect to search your deck for a continuous spell card (suggest: add Temple of the Kings to your hand in order to activate Awakening of the Sacred Beast the same turn). Next activate Spirit Gates final effect to discard Chaos Summoning Beast to the graveyard in order to summon Dark Summoning Beast from the graveyard. Activate Summoning Beasts special ability from the graveyard to add Fallen Paradise to your hand and activate its effect right away to draw two new cards. Use Dark Summoning Beast effect again to summon Hamon.  From then on, you should have the cards to summon Armityle the Chaos Phantasm and win the duel."

The Rokket package is also in theory the same as opening Regulator, but locks you out of the strongest end board the deck consistently has, but should be more then enough to shut down rough and low tier decks. This list can be trimmed back slightly to have more hand traps, or other potential starters or extenders.  &nbsp;  The 1 card full combo is simply Time Thief Regulator. Summon Regulator, using its effect to summon Winder, and Adjuster, sending Bezel Ship and adding Retrograde from deck. Making Force Strix, adding the copy of Singing Lanius, and reviving a copy of Bezel Ship from grave by detaching the other material from Force Strix. Making Wise Strix and summoning a copy of Raider's Wings from deck, then using the Bezel Ship and Raider's Wings to make the second copy of Force Strix, detaching to add Strangle Lanius from deck to hand, and causing Wise Strix to set a copy of Rank-up Shave Force from the deck, then using that Rank-up to revive the first copy of Force Strix, then stacking Cyber Dragon Infinity from your extra deck. Using the second copy of Force Strix and the Wise Strix, make Rusty Bardiche, using Rusty's effect to send a copy of Ancient Cloak to grave to set a copy of Shade Brigandine from deck. By banishing Ancient Cloak, add a copy of Silent Boots from deck to hand, giving you hand of Strangle Lanius and Silent Boots. Summon the copy of Strangle Lanius from your hand, locking you into DARK monsters. Use Strangle Lanius effect to revive the Singing Lanuis from the grave, then summon Time Thief Redoer. Revive the Raider's Wings from the grave by detaching a materiel from Redoer, then flip the Shade Brigandine, summoning it as a level 4 monster. Using the Shade Brigandine and the Raider's Wings to summon Time Thief Perpetua, and activating it's effect to attach a copy of Time Thief Chronocorder to the Redoer. Activate Redoer, detaching Chronocorder specifically, then reviving Chronocorder by it's own effect. Special summon the Silent Boots from your hand, then link off the Boots and Chronocorder into I:P Masquerena. banish the Boots from your grave, adding a Fog Blade or Phantom Knights Claw from your deck, and set it along with the Time Thief Retrograde. End the turn, returning the Redoer. During the opponents standby phase, attach the top card of the opponent's deck, then attach a copy of Time Thief Flyback to Redoer as well. As well, activating Perpetua's revive effect by detaching Raider's Wings to summon the Winder, and activate its effect, adding a copy of any Time Thief card from deck to hand.  &nbsp;  this combo ends on a +8, with a omni-negate from Infinity, a quick effect non-targeting spin to the top of the deck, as well as a spin from the Knightmare Unicorn that can be made with the I:P Masquerane, a spell/trap negate, that attaches the spell/trap negated to a Time Thief xyz, a monster negate, and a D.D.

Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 3 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video).  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Fiendish rhino warrior:</strong> Vale x2. Envía al cementerio el mismo target que la Tour guide, aunque no aprovecha el cuerpo extra. Necesita otro extender sí o sí.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish burial:</strong> Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots o Brigandine, o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster reborn:</strong> Extender por excelencia. Trae de vuelta algo que ya hayas usado.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>El Deck usa burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo, con 2 es suficiente para iniciar.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Aunque el burn es infinito, cartas como Ghost Sister que aumentan constantemente los LP arruinarán la estrategia.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si robamos 3 garnets, será gg.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

Also you can use DDL  and the Spells to search for Zhang Yuan or Zhang De if you have Ancient Warriors on the fiel. Guan Yun combined with Liu Xuang is a good start to fill your field with at least 3 monster with 3000+. Remember to put the Ancient Warriors S/T always, you need them to trigger some effects. Tri-Brigade are here to help on putting more cards on hand, especially if you didn't get the better hand. Also, Omen can swipe for 3000 which is always good.  I'm still figuring out how to draw and search for more cards. The biggest problem of Ancient Warrior is you can get your hands tied very often, so run 2 Reload and 2 Avarice, which proved to be very useful on my tests, however idk if they are the best strategy to keep my hand full or search for something when a strategy go wrong.  Ghost Ogre and Gnomaterial (not sure if i'll keep this one) are good, as you need to stop your opponent to summon powerful monsters because of Lu Feng negative effect. Tenki is very helpful if you need to search not only Ancients, but Tri-Brigade too, not so sure about Tensu.  I'm still thinking about the Extra, besides Blosson, Omen and DDL, the others were not very useful. The Side Deck is also a work in progress."

Hand trap suite looks kind of weird but I don't really know a better way to split them. Ash is great but can clog your own plays, Lancea is great vs meta and also pitches to Herald. Could maybe cut Strike for more of these but Strike is really good when you have to actually play yugioh with your opponent.

They can Synchro Summon monsters such as Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon to lock down the opponent's field or help Summon stronger monsters and set up a Fusion Summon for a finishing move. ""The White Stone of Legend"" needs another effect to discard it and be able to use its Graveyard effect. Whereas both the Monster cards ""Master"" and ""Sage with Eyes of Blue"" have effects to Special Summon any ""Blue-Eyes"" Monster from the Main Deck by either ""Shuffles itself from the Graveyard to the Main Deck"" ('Spinning to Deck' for short) or Discards itself.  ""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"" can also can Tribute itself to Special Summon any LIGHT Dragon-type Synchro monster from your extra deck. ""Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon"" is a Fusion Monster that does not need a ""Polymerization""-like card to be Fusion Summoned. It cannot be destroyed by battle, can attack monsters twice during the Battle Phase and banishes any monster that it failed to destroy by battle.""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"" is a Ritual Monster that cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects and can wipe out your opponent in a single display of doubled-piercing chaotic white lightning."

As you would expect, this heavily abuses Crystron Halqifibrax + Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon combos and can pretty reliably rip 3-5 cards out of the opponent's hand, even with negates at play. I think this deck is at least a rogue-tier strategy.  The main thing that makes this deck tick is Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince, as it sends Atlantean Dragoons for cost and thus isn't the type of thing someone wants to hand trap. You can get so much mileage off of that thing, it's insane. If you bring it out with Deep Sea Diva or One for One you're getting a full combo almost every time.  Your general opening will be Diva -&gt; Neptabyss, then climbing into Halq (bringing out Deskbot 001) and Auroradon, then using 001 + the tokens to bring out a Herald of the Arc Light. You can then destroy the remaining 2 tokens for Coltwing to bring out 2 more and revive 001, use that for a second Herald, then use both Heralds to go into Dugares. Detaching 2 Heralds and getting the draws with Dugares is a very big plus and you can often get significant mileage from it. You can alternatively run something like Nyarla or Daigusto Emeral with this, but I've found Dugares to be the most consistently good one.  Unlike quite a few Gishki builds I've seen, I think Deskbot 003 is detrimental to the deck. It's incredibly easy to hand trap and doesn't synergize with the deck's goals outside of going into Halq combos. It's a good engine card at a glance but it requires the opponent to just let you proc it and we all know that's not going to happen, and that can be the end of the turn right there. By cutting it out you're increasing the consistency by dedicating your normal summon to Diva or Neptabyss, both of which you're near-guaranteed to see thanks to all the search/draw options (Dragoons + Minstrel, Deep Sea Dria, One for One, Dugares draws, Talents draws). I also like not having to use two 001s, which the 003 combo really likes, which decreases consistency further...it's just a mess. If you want to run it though, cut out the Talents and Upstart and you can see what I mean in practice.  Anyway, onto the card reviews themselves.  <strong>Monsters (24):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Lapis Dragon <ul>  	<li>Great card to search off Dragoons to use as a combo piece. I like to do this with Minstrel + Dragoons since it's often a free Halq combo, but you can do it off the Neptabyss route if you really want to. If you get it in your opening hand it kinda sucks though.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Atlantean Dragoons <ul>  	<li>Broken. If you drop this with Neptabyss or Minstrel you're able to get virtually anything you want in the deck: Gishki Shadow/Vision for a ritual search, Minstrel, Diva, all of these are ways to get balls-deep into that hand loop. You're free to run 2 if you're afraid of bricking, but you're often selling yourself short and losing out on a few routes.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing <ul>  	<li>Summon it with Auroradon to go + one million, you get the idea. The destruction effect is nice if you're going second too, I guess, but you're playing it for the opening combo. It's a really fun card!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Shadow <ul>  	<li>This is your Aquamirror searcher, and sometimes a way to guarantee the final hand rip if you're short of cards. Also, this can trigger Deep Sea Aria after use, which is super helpful. If you're in a really tight spot for whatever reason, you can also use it as a Dugares material. Don't actually do that, though.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Minstrel <ul>  	<li>I was running this at 1 until I started field testing this deck and man oh man is this card stupid. It's a perfect way to trigger the Dragoons in your hand while collecting data and helping secure your hand loop for the turn. It's just flat out insane and not maxing out will really hurt you in the long run. She also triggers Deep Sea Aria after use which is nice. I never find myself using her second effect though, it just kinda sucks?</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Vision <ul>  	<li>Gishki Shadow but it can be summoned with Deep Sea Diva for a Herald summon. Nifty little tech if you get Neptabyss out without her help.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Diva <ul>  	<li>Using this to get out Neptabyss is your full Halqifibrax combo, and as such, you should never run less than 3. The heart and soul of this deck's combo starting antics.</li>  	<li>Here is a good one card + <strong>junk</strong> opening from Diva you can use to start your combo routes; <ul>  	<li>NS Diva -&gt; SS Neptabyss -&gt; Neptabyss eff, pitch Dragoons -&gt; Add Dragoons, GY Dragoons eff, search Deep Sea Minstrel -&gt; Use Deep Sea Minstrel's effect to pitch Dragoons and rip out a card, proc Dragoons to search Gishki Vision -&gt; Link Neptabyss and Diva for Halq -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; Climb into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, trigger 001 in GY -&gt; Synchro 001 + token for Herald -&gt; Auroradon 2nd eff, destroy 2 tokens, summon Coltwing -&gt; Coltwing eff, summon 2 tokens, trigger GY 001 -&gt; Synchro 001 + token for Herald -&gt; Xyz both Heralds for Dugares -&gt; Dugares 1st eff, draw 2 discard 1, detach both Heralds, discard <strong>junk</strong> -&gt; trigger both Heralds, search Gustkraken + Aquamirror -&gt; pitch Vision from earlier for another Gustkraken -&gt; Summon your first.</li>  	<li>From here, continue your plays utilizing your Dugares draws and other parts of your starting hand.</li>  	<li>You have the option of stopping at Halq to go into Desert Locusts on the opponent's turn if you have enough to go into a 4-card hand loop. This can be further extended into going into Baroness de Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon, or PSY-Framelord Omega depending on the materials you have on your board. Absolutely experiment with this, it's a very good route. The first sign you should try this route is if you have a One for One in hand since Neptabyss is largely what enables the route.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince <ul>  	<li>Ballbustingly good card, pitching Atlantean Dragoons for cost to trigger its effect while searching you another. This is a one-card way to trigger Minstrel while activating the Dragoons you searched, which leads to a +1 in card advantage overall. This doesn't interrupt your combo plays at all and you should never skip out on it.  If you don't have Diva, normal summon this and you won't be too impeded.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Deskbot 001 <ul>  	<li>For Halq and nothing else. Pray you don't draw it.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Evigishki Gustkraken <ul>  	<li>Literally a safer Topologic Gumblar Dragon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Spells (16):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x One for One <ul>  	<li>Summons Neptabyss from the deck for what's basically free, giving you a possible route of fetching Deep Sea Diva w/Aria to go into more lengthy combos. You can also summon Deskbot 001 if you're on shrooms or something I guess.</li>  	<li>Including Beautunaful Princess + Gishki Abyss can make this a free search but it kinda sucks honestly, I wouldn't go for it these days but the option is there.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Three Tactical Talents <ul>  	<li>Great contingency plan against hand traps since they're absolutely going to negate your stuff. This'll normally be Diva. Collect your Draw 2 if you want to continue popping off, but the hand rip is also an acceptable option if you think the negate is going to stop the full combo. Look at what backup combo pieces you have before making the decision.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Extra-Foolish Burial <ul>  	<li>I'd run more but drawing 2+ of these fucking sucks, man. This is a hand loop deck so you really want to max out on the non-HOPT cards unless they're absolutely necessary, which this isn't. Anyway, pitch Herald and call it a day.</li>  	<li>If you're going to run 3, cut Photomirror and Upstart Goblin.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Upstart Goblin <ul>  	<li> 39 Card Deck, yup.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Deep Sea Aria <ul>  	<li>Effortless to proc since you're burying those Gishki Shadows and Visions like your life depends on it. You can also banish one of the Dragoons. This searches you more Gishki Shadows and Visions to continue the hand loop, which is insanely useful.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Preparation of Rites <ul>  	<li>With this, you can make an excuse to cut a Vision, since this'll be grabbing you Gustkraken while getting an Aquamirror back. This is basically Pot of Greed and it's not even OPT for some reason. God, why is that a thing?</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Gishki Photomirror <ul>  	<li>There'll be times where you're a material short when trying to release the Kraken, which this remedies. Plus, if you have a Preparation of Rites in hand after using this, that becomes a ""one-card"" Gustkraken without having to tribute the one you previously summoned. Thus, that gives you a Rank 6. I don't see many people running this, so maybe I'm using this for the wrong reasons. Very cuttable, I just like the flexibility.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Gishki Aquamirror <ul>  	<li>The main spell you're using to loop Gustkraken, don't think I need to explain that.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Extra (15):</strong> <ul>  	<li>1x Baroness de Fleur (or Geomathmech Final Sigma) <ul>  	<li>You can bring this out with Diva + 2 L4s, Desert Locusts + 1 L4 or something, which is a free negate on the board for your torn-up opponent to get through. This often secures the win unless they got something real special. If using Geomathmech you can get that more easily with Desert Locusts + Gustkraken.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Borreload Savage Dragon <ul>  	<li>Good card to use after a Halq combo; again, this normally secures a win because of the negate.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x PSY-Framelord Omega <ul>  	<li>Another way to secure a hand loop at the end of a turn, can be summoned with Desert Locusts + an L2 as well, which few decks can pull off. If you're not able to hand loop for more than 3, try going for a Locusts + L2 play with this!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>3x Herald of the Arc Light <ul>  	<li>Your searchers and a funny negate + pseudo-vanitys if you can keep one on deck. Never run less than 3.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Constellar Ptolemy M7 <ul>  	<li>Straight from the 2013 build baby, this card still has it. Use this to get your Shadow back from the grave after proccing Aquamirror to continue the Gustkraken loop.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Virtual World Phoenix - Fanfan <ul>  	<li>You can also run Photon Strike Bounzer, but this deck is very weak going second and this has helped a lot in that regard. Detaches two Gustkrakens to banish a card from their hand and GY, which you can use to proc an otherwise dead Aquamirror too. Generally a really nice card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Number 60: Dugares the Timeless <ul>  	<li>You're generally only using Dugares for his draw effect, but the SS from GY can be handy if you're willing to forsake a follow-up. Anyway, the draw effect is largely what keeps him here, so if you want to use Dweller or Nyarla then by all means do so. Nyarla is particularly nice alongside the Heralds since you're possibly getting 3 searches off it.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Accesscode Talker <ul>  	<li>Bonk.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Knightmare Unicorn <ul>  	<li>Use this when going second to make life easier, and then climb into Accesscode Talker to swing for game. No other reason for using it, but it's a very good reason regardless!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon <ul>  	<li>Bonk but for going first.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2x Crystron Halqifibrax <ul>  	<li>Running 2 to give this deck a better follow-up post-hand loop, but you can drop the second if you have any better ideas. This card should be banned sometimes though ahahaha</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

I put several Insect cards with special summon and search effects to easily summon the deck's ace monster,  Metamorphosed Insect Queen. I have three main strategies for this deck: <ol>  	<li>Parasite Infection: Equip opponent's monsters with Parasite Paranoid, then activates Cocoon of Ultra Evolution to summon Perfectly Moth or Insect Queen. You can use it to get rid of strong monsters, even though it didn't work against Untargetable monsters.</li>  	<li>Switcheroo: Use Creature Swap to steal a opponent's monster, giving them a Worm Bait/Insect Queen token. It's more efficient than the Parasite Infection strategy, i recommend use it to do a Beatdown or get a strong monster to your side.</li>  	<li> Gozen Match: Many decks/archtypes have different attributes, so this can be a pain. This is a stall strategy, use this to hold the opponent's back while getting the right cards to do some of the other 2 combos.  Remember  the Deck is composed of Earth monsters, so think twice before use it.</li> </ol> Gokipon can search for Parasite Paranoid, while Howling Insect can summon Gokipole from the Deck, allowing you to use the Gokipole + Gokibore combo effect, and considering the Gokipole effect didn't target, you can get rid of stronger opponent's monster in a more efficient way. Use Pinch Hopper to summon Insect Queen from your hand (if you have it) destroying him or used it for a Link Summon, for example. Cocoon of Ultra Evolution it's the most important card of this deck, and if you didn't draw it on the first turn, you'll need to hold the game a bit until you draw Cocoon.  Your biggest problem will be the opponent's set cards. Feel free to add any other card to this decklist to supply this failure. I plan to update this on the future, but for now, is this."

Predap consists in put Counters, reduce level and fusion summon. The Main Deck star of this is Spinodionaea, who can put Predator counters on monsters when it's summoned. You can combo it with cards like Drosophyllum Hydra ou Banksiogre, to tribute your opponent's monsters-a-la-Kaiju. You can bring out Spino with Lonefire Blossom, Ophrys Scorpio or Predapratice. Darlingtonia Cobra can add Fusion cards to your hand if you special summon it with a Predaplant's monster effect.  The archtype Spells and Traps supports this strategies, adding more cards to your hand (Predaplanet), putting Predator Counters more easily (Predaplanning and Predaplast) and fusion summon (Predaprime Fusion). The Extra Deck Predap monsters are very useful and powerfull, with cards like Verte Anaconda and Triphyoverutum, together with Starving Venom."

And yes, surprise, I’m doing laval. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So here’s the list, the deck is a little pricy but it won’t murder you.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 laval burner</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval burner can special summon itself from your hand if you have 3 or more laval monsters with different names in your graveyard. It’s a level 5 monster with 1000 defense sadly, because most of the deck likes 200 defense but burner still gets 2 slots in my build for being a free body and is probably the only level 5 or higher laval worth playing in the game at the moment. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 neo-flamvell lady</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Neo-flamvell lady is one of the best cards to run in a laval deck like this one. It gives you a way to stop eldlich and other similar decks with a quick effect, and as an added bonus mills monsters directly from your deck to fill your graveyard with laval monsters! I gave it 3 slots purely for how well it works with laval in general.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval blaster</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval blaster can dump up to 5 cards off the top of your deck to the grave upon its normal summon provided you already have a laval in your graveyard. This is easily a common situation and laval archer can help you out with summoning it. Though it has 800 defense I still played it at three because of the sheer number of cards it can mill.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval archer</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval archer is super good. It can self revive for releveling, it provides another normal summon if you use it for a laval monster, and it has out magic 200 defense stat! I honestly love this card in general and I find it to be one of the best tools laval has at the moment, I gave it 3 spots for how helpful it is.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 laval lakeside lady</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card can destroy a set card but it’s main flaw is that it also ends up clearing your graveyard. You can mill this monster often enough that I only feel to play 1.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 ash blossom and joyous spring </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ash blossom and joyous spring is one of the best handtraps in the format and not only that but it’s a fire monster! I gave it three slots because if ash is in your deck, it going at 3.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval coatl </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval coatl is similar to laval burner but it’s a level 2 tuner. Just for being a tuner that can summon itself it got 3 slots</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 laval forest sprite</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval forest sprite can make your laval gain huge amounts of stats but it really is only being played for being a level 2 200 defense fire tuner.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 laval volcano handmaiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Laval handmaiden is an inanely useful card who mills 3 laval monsters! It also has 200 defense so you can mass spawn it with rekindling</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 de-synchro</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">De-synchro is a spell that takes apart a synchro monster, you can use it to take apart salamander and make dawn dragster or even repeat synchro monster effects.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 molten construction field</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is an absolute 3 of in laval decks! It can fill out 5 laval monsters combined with handmaiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 rekindled rebirth</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Grave tunes 200 defense fire monsters but it is a little bricky over one, it’s a nice tool to have regardless though.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 rekindling</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Oh my god, this is toadally staying at 3 in this build, it summons a lot and is a great card in general.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 searing fire wall</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Summons as many tokens as you like. It’s a great tool in this deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 flamvell counter</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This can banish a 200 defense fire in your graveyard to stop a spell/trap, I play it because of the sheer amount of 200 defense fires I can mill.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 infinite impenitence</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Free negate</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I think the extra deck is mostly self explanatory except for my choice of “Laval Dragon” not “Laval Dragun” whose completely explanatory but dragOn. So why? Simply put its effect is actually super good. It can shuffle 2 laval monsters from your graveyard into your deck to return a card from the field to the hand, but it’s not a hard once per turn which means as long as you have the laval monsters in your graveyard to work with you can keep on doing it, and you mill a ton of laval monsters really quickly with this deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">None of the combos are exactly linear but you have multiple ways start things and alongside the drawpower this deck provides I’ll admit that in the right hands I feel laval can be a pretty good deck. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Things to consider when piloting this deck: </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1: always pick a target if any before summoning neo-flamvell lady and only use her if your opponent has a graveyard, sure she’s a quick effect and everything but you don’t have much protection for her.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2: when using molten construction field try milling handmaiden, handmaiden cane mill two mor handmaidens and then pitch another laval of your choice.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3: if you’re confident about being able to do it and still summon other synchros then summon T.G. hyper librarian when possible.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I didn’t pick out a side deck yet because I don’t know what will happen in the future but if you have any ideas for a side deck then feel free to tell me!</span></p>"

Searchable monster reborn, a guardian slime wall, sphere mode, and the opportunity to lay down a 12k atk chicken and just win instantly. Ra’s second effect isn’t bad neither.  It’s a lot better than it seems. It goes under combo and tries to crack the board, or it goes over control by having ways to plus to infinity."

The deck focuses on turning off hand traps by using Vendread Battlelord, and then setting up a board to synchro into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity during your opponent's turn, locking them out of all card effects. Then if your opponent sets cards, nuke their board with Bethor (5 pops). It's a gg if you successfully summon King Calamity, and can be done with a 2-card hand of only Alpha/Zeta.  The Alpha/Zeta combos are shown off in this video, along with some other cool ones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVtRJAKwfOw  If you choose the route that allows for follow-up, there is no flexibility in the extra deck at all unfortunately.  There are lots of other crazy things you can do with this deck post-LIOV and also post-DAMA; this is just one of them. Let me know if you want to see more!"

XD</span>  <span>Anyway,, the goal of this deck is simply to simply mill your opponent's whole deck. You probably won't be able to deplete their life points, so this is really the only win condition</span>  <span>Main Strategy:</span> <span>-Getting 3 bone towers is relatively easy, just special summon one and then use your Inferno Reckless Summon to pull out all 3. Sometimes you won't be able to summon all 3, or you may not need all 3, however the more you have, the more cards you can mill.</span> <span>-Next up, you need a Chakanine. It requires 2 level 4 monsters, which is easy to achieve with the Uni Zombie card. (Don't be afraid to use a tower as material if needed. You can mill 12 cards per tower with this chain, so do the math and find out how many you need to win.)</span> <span>-Finally we have Zombie World. Now, ZW can sometimes be a pain to get out, however cards such as Necroworld Banshee and Terraforming should make it easier if you don't draw it :). Zombie World is arguably the most important card in this combo, without it, the Zoodiacs won't count as zombie types, and therefore will not trigger bone tower. Protect it as well as you can.</span> <span>After you pull off this and mill 12-36 cards of your opponent's deck, simply use your leftover Zoodiac and a tower to summon Vampire Sucker to mill another 4, and use Sucker's effect for yet another 4 cards, bringing the total number of cards milled to 44 (with 3 towers)</span>  <span>Side Strategy:</span>  <span>- If for some reason your Zoodiacs get stopped, there are other cards that could help mill a few more cards and earn that sweet victory :)</span> <span>- You can suicide your pyramid turtles (with bone tower on the field) in order to special another turtle from the deck, rinse and repeat 3 times to mill 6-18 cards.</span> <span>If done strategically, you can use the last turtle to pull out a Solitaire, who then sacrifices itself and specials yet another zombie. Use this to summon Uni Zombie, and hey presto, you have a gateway to another zombie, just use uni to grave a Mezuki, and then use Mezuki's effect.</span>  <span>All in all, this seems pretty good, there are many ways to special summon zombie monsters, but unfortunately I cannot go over them all :P</span>  <span>A few things to note before I go:</span> <span>- PSY-Framelord Omega, Burial from a Different Dimension, and Leviair the Sea Dragon's effect allows you to recycle Mezuki over and over, use it wisely :)</span> <span>- There is a smaller Utopia XYZ chain in the extra deck for incase the Zoodiacs fail. It is not as big but works well in a pinch.</span> <span>- A Mechquipped Angineer summoned in attack position can protect you for 2 turns if you need to stall.</span> <span>- Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn is able to mill 3 cards from your own deck. This can be favourable in some cases, but be wary that spells and traps are at risk too.</span> <span>- If your oponent has a 40+ card deck, choose to go second. Let your opponent play their turn, shorten their deck and make your job a little easier. If they have a 40 card deck then it doesn't matter so much since they'll only have 35 cards left for you to mill, perfect for an OTK with the right hand</span>  &nbsp;  <span>And yeah, that's about it :)</span> <span>If I come across any issues or updates to the deck I'll be sure to edit this post or even create a new one :P</span>  <span>Again, feel free to message my discord (Katsuki#8104) with any questions or suggestions, or just comment on the post (I check in on this site every few days, so Discord would be much faster if that's what you're after)</span>  <span>Goodbye and thanks for reading :)</span>"

I will quickly define what is being a budget player for me and then talk about the deck strategy and the choices i made.  &nbsp;  <strong>Budget</strong> : Is constructing a strategy to be as efficient possible with the least amount of money. I wouldn't for example pay 20 bucks for a card and the total price range of the deck should be around 100 €, but of course this can vary depending if I really like the archetype or not.

Then everything is normal ratio wise until you see that i play 6 traps. The 3 <strong>Tri-Brigade Revolte</strong> let's you have a free 3000 body who banishes somehting on the turn of your ennemy. It is not mandatory since it conflicts with the <strong>Barrier Statue lock</strong>, but i haven't had any issues with that throught the playtesting yet. The most important trap is <strong>Harpie's Feather Storm</strong>. This card is broken... and i'm really affraid to show it because this card alone let's you win games. It synergises very well with lyrlusc since they are wind winged beast monsters. You can set this card at the beginning of your plays to ensure you to go into your full combo since it shuts down handtraps. Or you could simply add an omni monster negate for the turn to your lock."

The only difference being the side deck; the OCG player went with: 3x Maxx ""C"" 3x Chicken Game 3x Upstart Goblin 3x Self-Destruct Button 3x Wall of Revealing Light  Obviously very banned side deck here in the TCG, the side deck that I've provided is very flexible and just what I thought would be nice. The list also plays a single copy of <strong>Booby Game</strong> in the main deck, an OCG card that acts similarly to Waking the Dragon but has an actual on-field effect as well. It can be replaced a third copy of Magic Cylinder or Waking the Dragon. The extra deck also has <strong>Borrelend Dragon</strong>, another OCG card, as a target for Waking the Dragon. It's a very strong card and the closest TCG alternatives may be Borrelsword Dragon or Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops.  The Windwitch engine allows the deck very easy access to a powerful negate in the form of <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong>, as well as giving a bit of burn damage along the way in the form of Windwitch - Ice Bell and Windwitch - Winter Bell.  The small Sky Striker engine allows access to <strong>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</strong> who can attack directly for an easy 1500 damage—rather underwhelming in any other deck but infinitely more valuable in a burn deck.  Lava Golem is a very strong card in the format, and this particular decklist can take full advantage of it because its combo starter (Windwitch - Ice Bell) Special Summons itself from the hand so the loss of a Normal Summon from Lava Golem is no problem.  <strong>Gravedigger's Trap Hole</strong> is a very strong trap card that not only does a hefty amount of burn damage but also negates monster effects that activate in the hand, GY, or banished zone meaning your Pot of Desires is much safer against Ash Blossom. Just a very strong card that will be live against every meta deck.  <strong>Ceasefire</strong> is a surprisingly good card in the format, punishing combo decks for having too many monsters on the field. Note that it does not require face-down monsters to activate, but if there are face-down monsters flipping them face-up is only a bonus as Ceasefire will not trigger their flip effects."

I'm Omega, and i'm just a kid trying to play Yugioh without spending a fortune on cards. I'm not amazingly experienced with this deck, but i love the pendulum mechanic, and it just so happens that you can assemble this entire deck for a super low price! I didn't intend on getting to this point in writing this, but i love it when people write stuff here so I can learn more about the deck, and the person playing it!</span></strong></p>  <h2><span><strong>What I Can Do</strong></span></h2> <p><strong><span>I haven't experimented with the deck to the fullest, but i can usually get to an Apollousa with one of my disruption XYZ monsters, which are Infinity or Dweller. Getting to Vortex Dragon is also a line that i haven't quite gotten down, considering we only really have 6 level 7s in the deck to get to it, making it hard unless you open up a hand that works for that. Alkahest is also a disruption, but i can never get to it alongside Apollousa, unless my hand is like, extremely lucky. So usually I end on something like 4 disruptions, up to 5 in testing, and i'm not sure if you can get a 6th one on board, but i run out of fusion spells for another Alkahest or Azortless, I can never get Vanisher into the extra deck for a Mithrilium, and overall i just run out of steam before i can get to 6, even 5 disruptions. Super Poly is a option i added if you have copies lying around as i believe it is a deck that can make it work really well, but i can't see a reason to main deck it since you need your full hand to combo. Aside from that, the side deck is barren because i'm still a massive noob who hasn't figured out how to side deck well, plus many of the cards in the side can get pretty pricy.</span></strong></p>  <h2><strong><span><span>Some stuff i was looking to find for the deck:</span></span></strong></h2> <p><strong><span>A link 3 </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>A different rank 4</span></strong></p>  <h2><strong><span><span>Deck Edits:</span></span></strong></h2> <p><strong><span>Removed Abductor, i don't think it fits that great in the deck </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Replaced Chronograph package for Box Of Friends + Counter for more normal summon</span></strong></p> <p><span><b>Put Borrelsword back, Orichalc does not otk unless there was a defense position monster there.</b></span></p> <p><strong><span>Removed Emergen</span><span>cy Teleport, deck is a bit cheaper, and brings it to 40 cards.</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Put Super Poly in, I realized that generally you can find a way to keep at least one card in hand, and sometimes it works well when you get vanisher in hand, use mithrilium as material, and then mithrilium's GY effect summons out vanisher, leading to big boy interruptions.</span></strong></p> <p></p>"

Deck not so ""explosive"" that plays control with a wide range of options as well as being fun and calm, in addition to sometimes surprising in matches.  <strong>Kings of fire</strong>  <strong>High Avatar Garunix: </strong>Boss Monster of the archetype, can clear fields and you will always want to rotate 2 of them.  <strong>Arvata: </strong>Best monster on the Deck by 1. Denial 2. Revive 3. 200 DEF.  <strong>Yaksha: </strong>You can destroy cards and it's not a bad name.  <strong>Barong: </strong>Searcher.  <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings: </strong>Very good card to search for the necessary bodies of the Fire King.  <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings: </strong>Revive and destroy the opponent on your turn.  <strong>Fire King Island: </strong>The best card in the Deck, since it activates destructions like Diagram, in addition to searching.Extra Cards.  <strong>Horny boys</strong>  <strong>Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua:</strong> NUKE  <strong>True King Agnimazud:</strong> Destroy FIRE to summon and banish.  <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</strong>: Heavy Storm.  <strong>Nine-Tailed Fox:</strong> Token Generator.  <strong>Ash Blossom:</strong> You know...  <strong>Spell/Trap(s)</strong>  <strong>Terraforming: </strong>Search Field.  <strong>Rekindling: </strong>Spam and OTK.  <strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>To good.  <strong>Fire Formation - Tenki: </strong>Search Fire Kings.  <strong>Generation Shift: </strong>Good Tech.  <strong>Torrential Tribute: </strong>Really good trap, early unnexpected.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Zoodiac-ZEUS: </strong>Chakanine generic, to Boarbow direct attack and the Zeus, is just too good (Not necessary).  <strong>Hope Harbinger: </strong>Rank 8.  <strong>Utopia: </strong>Lightning is really good, you can replace with Double.  <strong>Tiger King: </strong>Is always good for Beast-Warriors.  <strong>Bagooska: </strong>To Stall.  <strong>Accesscode &amp; Knightmare: </strong>Best generic links.  <strong>Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze: </strong>Fire Link.  <strong>Duelittle Chimera: </strong>Original Fire Link.  <strong>Other Options</strong>  <strong>Tri-Brigade: </strong>This can fit in any Beast, Beast-Warrior, Winged-Beast.  <strong>Yubel: </strong>It's an interesting version.  <strong>Generic: </strong>Hazy Flame Griffin is a + Body, Coach Soldier Wolfbark is a insta XYZ or Link (Especially Duelittle), Fire Formation - Tensu is another normal.  <strong>Handtraps: </strong>The deck can carry some good handtraps, although I prefer Ash Blossom for being FIRE.  <strong>Another XYZs: </strong>Any Rank 4 is good.  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  Barong and Yaksha have a special Summon effect that is sometimes forgotten.  Rekindling can carry three, but this Deck is not focused on excessive spam.  You can change various generic cards such as Handtraps, Spell / Traps, Xyzs and Links.  It can be a bit difficult to decide whether to go first or second with the Deck, so you have to think about it, I usually prefer to go first.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>Remakes:</strong> Remakes for various deck like Albaz, Fusion Toolbox, Infernity Xyz.  <strong>Shiranui World: </strong>Maybe is too normal.  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> HI.  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment and share"

If not, try to make Winda to go with Hamon.  If they have hand traps, Dark Beckoning and Ceremony should bait out hand traps to at least do something with Shaddolls.  Going second: Same idea, bait with Sacred Beasts and lock down with Shaddoll.  From my observation: <ul>  	<li>Good against: Dragon Link and generally anything Pure Shaddoll is good against.</li>  	<li>Weak against: Trap heavy decks, Dragoon (if you couldn't get Winda out), probably others too</li> </ul> Modifications: Could replace Rilliona and Magistus spells with mini Invoked engine but that kinda defeats the purpose for me."

Dark Contract with the witch is included in case you already have full combo in hand. If you end up with Siegfried on field and opponent activates Dark Ruler no more, you can chain Dark Contract with the witch and then chain Siegfried to negate Dark Ruler no More.  Standard Combo:  Try to get D/D Lamia, D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Servant Kepler and D/D Necroslime in your hand.  Activate Swirl Slime to fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis Normal Summon D/D Servant Kepler, search Dark Contract with the witch, if you have all combo pieces. Otherwise search Dark Contract with the Gate and get a missing piece with Gate. Banish Swirl Slime from GY to special summon D/D Lamia This activates Genghis' effect to special summon Necroslime from GY  (You should now have Genghis, Kepler, Lamia and Necroslime on field)  Synchro Summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander with Lamia and Genghis Link Summon Cross-Sheep with Necroslime and Kepler Activate Necroslime in GY to fusion summon D/D/D High Flame King Genghis (using Necroslime + D/D/D Flame King Genghis) - Important: Summon to cross-sheep Zone! This triggers Gust King Alexanders effect to special summon Lamia back from GY. Don't use Cross-Sheep yet! Use Lamia and Gust King Alexander to Synchro Summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. Important: To Cross-Sheep Zone! Trigger Cross Sheep, to get Lamia back on field. That triggers D/D/D High Flame King Genghis to special summon Alexander back from GY Use Cross Sheep and Lamia to Link Summon Halqifibrax and special summon another Lamia with its effect. Use Alexander and Lamia to either special summon Borreload Savage Dragon or Siegfried. Then use Lamias effect to special itself from GY by sending a dark contract to GY (e.g. Gate) Use Lamia and High Flame King Genghis to Synchro Summon Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen.  Thats usually my endboard. When a negate has been used, you can use Halqifibrax' effect to special summon Formula Synchron from Extra Deck and activates its effects to draw a card and Synchro Summon Sattelite Warrior with either Siegfried/Borreload or Crystal Wing. This allows you to destroy up to 3 cards (3 Synchros in GY) and gives him 1k Attack boost per destroyed card.  &nbsp;  In case you bricked and can't get to all combo pieces:  e.g. Start hand is swirl slime, necro slime and 3 bricks: Use Swirl Slime effect to fusion summon Flame King Genghis. Then Necroslimes effect to fusion summon the second Genghis.  Overlay them for Highwave King Caesar. He allows you to negate 2 effects that special summon monsters. This is not once per turn!  &nbsp;  Learning this deck takes a while and I still am not able to get 100% of the potential out of it."

Souls on Cybern allows you to instantly revive Cyberdarkness t1 plus it refills your hand with 2 precious cards. But you lose a significant margin of flexibility  *Going 2nd you should simply go for the Chimeratech Rampage (or Overdragon or CED) OTK. Just pray you top Droplets  &nbsp;"

I will not change my mind.,"This deck strongly focuses on keeping a steady supply of Dinomist Monsters on the field and in the hand, as well as keeping some layer of support on the field to keep the deck's momentum going.  The end-goal is to Pendulum Summon into the Extra Deck monsters that control the board, with <em>Adreus </em>as targeted destruction, <em>Digvorzhak</em> as a strong mill, field control, and beatstick, and <em>Utopia the Lightning</em> and <em>Dragon Ogre</em> as self-buffing beatsticks to bash over high-attack Monsters your opponent may have on the field.  With each Dinomist Monster serving as its own breed of protection, half of them from Battle and the other half for Card Effects, the other support included are <em>Dinomic Powerload </em>to simultaneously beef Dinomists and nerf the opponent's field, <em>Dinomist Charge</em> to keep Dinomist monsters cycled from your extra deck into your hand, and the various traps provided in the archetype to either summon, set scales, or retaliate against destroyed Monsters.  Outside of the archetype, <em>Moray of Greed</em> is a great card to reset a rough hand to get better Dinomists to set scales, <em>Ash </em>and <em>Nashipachi</em> as Tuners to go into the powerful Synchros of the deck, and other miscellaneous support to control the field such as <em>Feather Duster </em>and <em>Solemn Strike. </em>In regard of the Extra Deck, beyond what was mentioned, it also features generic Machine support through <em>Karakurei Shogun</em> and <em>Samurai Destroyer</em>, and better Link support to keep Dinomists cycled and easy to Pendulum Summon, using <em>Eria the Water Charmer </em>and <em>Mistar</em>."

The ideal play is to use Summoner Monk to go into  Treasure Panda, then summon the Limbs of Exodia. After which we link summon Saryuja Skull Dread to get the limbs in the GY (then draw 4 &amp; return 3). Then with our draw spells keep drawing until we get get the Head of Exodia &amp; 2 copies of Dark Factory of Mass Production.  We play 1x Royal Magical Library to be special summoned by Saryuja Skull Dread for its effect to draw 1 card, plus its a spellcaster which we can use with Wonder Wand &amp; Spellbook of Knowledge.  We play 2 hand traps 1x Ash Blossom &amp; 1x Ghost Belle. Ash doesn't need to be explained &amp; we play 1 Ghost Belle to prevent the opponent from banishing our limbs from the GY, if we lose those limbs we'll likely lose.  Our other spells we play:  2x Tri-Wright to bring back our Exodia Limbs for link plays &amp; to sack for Wonder Wand &amp; Spellbook of Knowledge to keep drawing two cards.  1x Dark Eruption just in case we lose the Head of Exodia so we can use this to get it back, it also can be used to get a limb if we need to.  1x Instant Fusion for Thousand-Eyes Restrict to remove something from the field if we need it gone, plus its a spellcaster we can sack for 2 cards.  1x The Grand Spellbook Tower to recycle our Spellbooks (and draw 1 card), its a target for Spellbook of Knowledge to destroy &amp; because we needed a 3rd different spellbook to use Crowley the First Propheseer search effect.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Most of the Extra Deck is for removal like Thousand-Eyes Restrict, Relinquished Anima or Akashic Magican our main extra deck monster is Saryuja Skull Dread. With how easy this deck swarms the field getting Saryuja Skull Dread draw 4 &amp; return 3 effect is really easy. Crowley the First Propheseer allows use to get 1 spellbook from our deck (granted our opponent choices, but think of it as a draw 1 card). We also use some rank 4s like Daigusto Emeral since we can get level 4s on the field quite easy &amp; a single rank 1 Slacker Magician which can buy you a turn if you need it.  <strong>Strengths</strong> <ul>  	<li>Great at drawing through the deck</li>  	<li>Exodia on turn 1 is very possible with this deck</li>  	<li>Can survive a turn or 2 to get to Exodia</li>  	<li>Swarms the field pretty quickly</li> </ul> <strong>Weaknesses</strong> <ul>  	<li>Banishing cards is basically a auto lose</li>  	<li>Skill Drain is a nightmare for this deck to play against</li>  	<li>Imperial Order shuts this deck down</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Tell me what you think &amp; how to improve the deck, I'm not the best at deck building so feel free to alter the list yourself"

And one of the new cards we got is a broken Level 10 Synchro monster: Baroness De Fleur!  &nbsp;  Anyways, here is my rather clumsy attempt to build a pure De Fleur deck that uses the new cards. It's built to go second, so I call it ""Berserker De Fleur."" Your strategy if going first is simple: Summon Baroness De Fleur and hope you drew at least one hand trap. If going second, your goal is to pop the eff off and try to OTK your opponent.  As for why Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend is in this deck, that's in case Necro Fleur and Fleur Synchron are both in your hand. So if you summon Scarlight with Fleur Synchron, you can use Fleur Synchron's floating effect to summon Necro Fleur from your hand. Then use Scarlight's effect to pop it and any other monsters. Then you can use Necro Fleur's effect to summon Sorciere De Fleur from the deck and steal a monster from the opponent's Graveyard for further plays.  &nbsp;  Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Magical Dragon is just there to help OTK. Its first effect can potentially get some Spells in the Graveyard. Then if you can link summon Selene, use her second effect to summon a Spellcaster from your hand or Graveyard, and use them to make a 5300-ATK Accesscode Talker. After that, you can use Chaos Dragon's second effect to revive it, and inflict 8300 damage to your opponent!"

Though, I'm not afraid of banishing cards for example either- as past iterations even used cards like necro fusion! That said: Let's get into the strategy.  The pendulum package: Sky iris- It can protect Odd-eyes, performapal, and magician pendulums in the scales- It can also search odd-eyes cards like: odd-eyes pendulum, arc pendulum, gravity dragon, and soul pendulum! soul pendulum and advent I use to utilize the pendulums in the ways they do since mr4 and 5. Endymion- this card and I go way back starting with my first ever structure deck, Spellcaster's command! and In this build I am using cards from Order of the Spellcasters. Endymion, reflection, servant, magister, and lab. Lab essentially counts as the endymion citadel in this deck, and in a pinch at the cost of six spell counters can special summon a level 7 spellcaster from hand or deck! coupled with cards like Magical something, gravity dragon, u go golem, time and stargazer, xiangsheng, and nobledragon magician; gravity dragon makes the opponent pay life points to activate card effects, nobledragon gives way to meteorburst which stops effects during battle! Magical something gets back quick play spells from the grave, stargazer and time gazer protect pendulum monsters, dragonox can bring warriors or spellcasters with 2000 or less atk back from the grave, xiangsheng can ""copy"" the atk of one other monster you control which means free beatstick, and u go golem simply just another way to fusion dragon knight out but with odd-eyes and dark magician in this case.  The deck cycler engine: main cards A feather of the phoenix, Jar of avarice, and hidden spellbook- but I also use boogie trap! Dealer's choice, crystal seer, reload, recovery, and card trader are the draw power coupled with feather, spellbook, and boogie it cycles- and if need be I have cards like deep grave, and monster reborn to bring back monsters! this segways into the defensive cards: counter counter, cash back, broken line (which I might sub out for red reboot), providence, and negate attack are my spell speed 3s mst is self explanatory, sphere kuriboh stops a monster's attack; adapter, mirror force, Punch-in-the-box, and cylinder are for if i am in a bad situation.  Lastly we have the meet and bones of the deck: the DM buster blader package.  eternal soul, circle, and expanded all work with dark magician- and by extension dragon knight! which more than makes up for dark magician's lack of effects. super poly is a free fusion summon w/o opponent interfering at the discard of a card, dsf for the buster blader fusions; then we get to chaos max which can also be summoned via advent- if need be I can use felgrand or creation with them. If i discard cerburrel for Apprentice illusion magician's effect it get's both aim, and cerburrel on the field making it a free scarlight synchro summon if need be! AIM can also buff dark spellcasters so DM, lord of d, or dark paladin are the obvious targets there. lord of d protects keeper, valkyria protects lord of d, double coston, keeper, and kaiser are all for tribute summons of their respective natures! light for Kaiser, dark for Coston, and dragon for keeper. the side deck are optional cards I personally chose that I thought would also benefit the deck and Selene tho I don't have her physically- I can't really use electrumite beyond casual since it's on the forbidden list- and she is a card i want. she and daybreaker also use spell counters, amd since pendulums need links it's a win-win! saryuja is a no-brainer who wouldn't want his effects? i also use heavenly spheres as well as decode! my goal by posting both this version and 15 is to try to find a optimal list to go about bringing to reality the next iteration of my deck. I mentioned before that this whole deck idea started with mainly spellcasters back in 2016, and evolved with the coming of dark paladin, buster blader, and buster blader's fusion- and when I battled against my friends over the years I sought to incorporate pendulums, and so it was a question of: ""how do I use fusion, synchro, xyz, and rituals in a deck?"" seeing the potential in it i experimented and explored- tho mr4 and 4.5(unofficially mr5) complicated the strategy with needing link monsters to pendulum summon from the extra deck. Additionally I've considered the likes of the palladium oracles, chaos max magician, as well as cards from dragon link and red eyes dragoon! at first i sought to have 10 tuners in the deck- ten chances to synchro summon, but the problem there is i only go into 3 synchros in this iteration and it wasn't necessary the main issues is likely card optimization, and efficient consistency- but I feel this deck idea definitely has potential- to find the best iteration i'd have to leave no road untraveled in designing/building."

If you think that you can't find enough Fire Formation cards I would recommend adding either one Liang peak or a Terraforming. You can only activate Ingen and Domei once per turn and you need to use Domei for your Eland (searched with Elephant), Liang peak is better than Ingen as it is still very useful even if not fully stacked. (You can still add 1 Ingen if you believe Liang+Terraforming is not enough).  P(Kerass≥1)= 85% success. This success rate includes Tenki as a Tri-Brigade card for obvious reasons searching Fraktall. If you fear God you can increase the rate of Nervall in the deck but I'd like to keep bricks to a minimum (already being Domei and Buffalo whereas Nervall, Sinto, Thoroughblade, Zhuge Kong and Eland being somewhat okay bit not great if drawn). Kerass overall success rate depends on a higher density of monsters not only to be discarded, but also for the banishing effect, meaning that useful extender spells such as monster reborn and Fire Kings cards were dissmissed in favour of less explosivity but a more competent deck. This is also in line with a Zoodiac combo I was playing around with using Ratpier and Barage as starters and an extender but they were inconsistent and didn't have a consistent starting combo.  The Zoodiac units in the Extra are to give Drident multiple materials for pops but if you aren't using her, to send Tiger King to the grave, she only needs one material, therefore you can make more room in the Extra. I wouldn't recommend reducing the number of Thoroughblade unless you do get rid of Chakanine and Tiger Mortar as you cannot access that part of the extra deck without a free Zoodiac summoned off of Tiger King, requiring a higher Zoodiac density.  If I was to change anything maybe I'd add some beast-warrior extenders like Tengu but not much else, for consideration Boar -&gt; Lavalval Exlord or Borreload Savage. Could add more cards for going second such as Bear, Gorilla, Called By The Grave. Maybe you could abuse Saryuja I don't think it's neccessary though. Tri-Brigade Rendezvous for OTK potential.  *I am completely unsure about Heraklinos I haven't tested him whatsoever I just recently put in Daigusto Emeral and with that you can cycle more allowing for a few more summons which I think could enable his addition*  &nbsp;"

Summons a Beast from hand on summon.  2x Gladiator Beast Attorix-Flexible Name, you dump any Glad Beast and Attorix becomes that name and level,flexible use depending on situations.  2xGladiator Beast Bestiari- Usually a send off of Attorix,or hard summoned for Gyzarus,can cut one if you prefer a different name  1x Gladiator Beast Darius- Name for recoverability,summons another from grave  2xGladiator Beast Vespasius-A free summon and name for Domitianus,usually sent off Attorix or summoned from hand,whatever the situation calls for.  3xPSY-Framegear Gamma- makes sure your rescue cat(and to some extent the battle shuffling effects) resolves.  1x PSY-Frame Driver- needed for Gamma  3xTest Tiger-Free summon,you can choose to activate the effect,but not really reccommended  Spells:  1xCalled By the Grave- Insulates you from some handtraps  3xGladiator Proving Ground-The deck's themed ROTA(not once per turn btw)  2xGladiator's Beast's Respite-Fixes your hand. Can be replaced for a better draw spell.  3xGladiator Beast's Comeback-The deck's themed reborn(wow broken no opt as well)  3xUnexpected Dai- Free summon. Enough said.  Traps:  3xGladiator Beast War Chariot-Free negate,also not opt,can be replace for more generic stuff.  Extra Deck:  2x Test Panther-Main ED starter,usually summons Augustus,also searches any Glad Beast card,not just monsters on summon.(broken)  2x Editor-Main Fusion Summon of the deck. Summons the big bosses  2xDomitianus-Monster Negate. Decent Stats. Enough Said.  1xHeraklinos-Spell/Trap Negate. Also good stats. Usually only used against backrow decks.  2xGyzarus-Free double pop. Not really reccomended in 2021,but if the situation calls for it,go ahead.  1x Dragases- You can take this out. Won't really make a difference.  1xLambda-Did you know it's generic? And did you know none of the Glad Beast monsters lock you into anything? Well now you do. Can link with Editor or Panther with Driver for an endphase gamma search.(Assuming you used gamma this turn)  1xOmega-Decent synchro I guess.Good against Dogmatika.  1xFerrijit-Decent Link extender,can fix hand,also good against Dogmatika.  1xAndabata-just a worse Editor,can be taken out if so wished.  1x Link Spider-For when you draw Andal.Also good against Lost World.  Side Deck is completely arbitrary,you can place anything you so wanted.  Combo:  Make any 2 into Panther,panther summon Augustus, make editor, and go from there.  That's about it. Hope you like the deck. Feedback always appreciated.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

It eats you.,"If you get too many pieces or tuners in your hand, don't be afraid to use your normal summon to link spider to special summon another piece or tuner from the hand, than go into your ye ol' kuriboyo there to bust out your secure olive gardna. Obliterate is your best friend for compulsory evac here. You know what to do if you see panda and toon table. Express it all to the graveyard and gather up as much resource material as you can to go straight into saryuja skull fawk and draw with his effect. If you get a summoner monk, boom. Use him to throw out another panda and hit yourself a number 60 duggies and use his effect to draw the 3. Don't get scared on me. This is just the beginning. There's so many plays here if you got the right hand the left hand the legs and the brain of it all. (See what I did there? Me neither)  The side deck is just for extra fun and sparkles if you want to mix it up a bit. Please go for the quintet because I'll love you forever. It's ok to banish up to 3 pieces because that's what acquisitiveness is there for. Bro I just wanna see you shine. If you pull out of the beast of the pharaoh while the librarian is on the mat, may god card have mercy on your opponents chances."

It has a unique playstyle which requires you to plan several turns ahead. Like other control decks, it's weak to back row removal. Like other decks playing a large amount of high level monsters, it has some consistency problems.  The best card in the deck may be Metaphys Dimension. Use it to banish one of your opponent's cards every turn (each of yours and your opponent's). Combining Dimension with Trap Trick, Metaphys Ascension, and using Dimension itself to summon Ragnarok when your opponent Special Summons, you can interrupt your opponent's combos.  <strong>Explaining the ratios:</strong>  You play 3 copies of Ragnarok, Asymmetaphys, Dimension, and Ascension because these form your core Metaphys engine. Your goal should be to use all of these as often as you possibly can. It can be bricky but playing 3 copes of Daedalus and Nephthys is important (notice that these are not once per turn effects!) as banishing them with Asymmetaphys or Ragnarok is always good. Tyrant dragon isn't as good as Daedalus or Nephthys so I only play 2 copies. Because he's bad to draw, I sometimes wish I could only play 1 copy but it's sometimes important to summon a Tyrant off of another Tyrant. I have never missed the third.  Metaphys Factor and Decoy Dragon are both useful but the are searchable and only good in niche scenarios, so you don't need to play more than one copy of either.  You can only play 2 copies of Necroface if you want. That would reduce the probability of bricking but decrease the power ceiling. Also, using Aloof Lupine to banish double Necroface is hilarious.  I play Lost Wind because it's my favorite second normal trap target for Trap Trick. I've also tried Impermanence, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Different Dimension Ground as alternatives. It could be that some other trap is better here, but I like the value that Lost Wind provides, especially since you can use it in the damage step when someone is trying to attack over Ragnorak.  <strong>The Extra Deck:</strong>  You only seldom will summon anything from the Extra Deck. (But note that Pot of Extravagence or Prosperity aren't that good because it's important to be able to use Asymmetaphys as often as possible).  All the monsters in the extra deck are here for very specific scenarios. I'll just share the couple that are most important but may seem strange on first inspection: <ol>  	<li>Almiraj is for the very specific scenario where you draw Necroface, Asymmetaphys, and either Dimension Shifter or Dimensional Fissure, and some other Metaphys card to banish with Asymmetaphys. Then you can summon the necroface and reduce its attack with Asymmetaphys to be able to link it away for Almiraj, thus banishing the Necroface to trigger its effect.</li>  	<li>Geomathmech is there because in Main Phase 2, if you Summoned Tyrant or Nephthys with Ragnarok's effect and didn't win that Battle Phase, it's a little better to sit on Geomathmech than a pair of Metaphys monsters with no protection.</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes Flare Metal: If in your own Standby Phase you summon Daedalus and clear your opponent's board, then summon Ragnarok. Attacking directly with these two and using Ragnarok's effect to Summon another Daedalus from the deck is a total of 6700 to 7600 damage (depending on how many Metaphys cards Ragnarok banished). This will leave your opponent to play there turn under Flare Metal's effect with somewhere between 1300 and 400 LP.</li> </ol>"

Main goal is to pump out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Dragoon"">Dragoon</a> and other extra deck threats by using grave effects to summon a bunch of high level monsters.  Opener I've been most comfortable w/ has been ecplipse wyvern along w/ Dragon Ravine &amp; one small &amp; one large dragon ruler to help get heavy hitters with little to no effort. Starting off by using the small dragon ruler to pull a higher form and send eclipse to the grave, banishing Darkness Metal with its effect, then summoning your other dragon ruler by banishing eclipse &amp; the other one. Summoning Darkness Metal by banishing one of the dragon rulers to pull Dragonic Knight or either of the Mythic Dragons (Dragonic if your board is slightly lacking, Mythic if you have the other in hand). Finally, using Dragon Ravine to send your last card in hand to grave to send arkbrave or felgrand to grave, with Felgrand being monster removal, and Arkbrave acting as a Harpie's Feather Duster+ on a stick. Use the summoned monster and your remaining Dragon Ruler to summon Verte, then pull out Dragoon. If you somehow found the Mythic Dragons in your hand by the end of this, normal summon the earth one and special the water, then XYZ (Cipher to Dark Matter if going 2nd, Hope Harbinger if 1st)  The Mythic dragons are used primarily to pull out Galaxy-Eyes Cipher into Dark Matter Dragon, and alternatively Hope Harbinger if you want to delay your opponent's setup. Dragonic Knight is some extra protection for your big monsters like Darkness Metal &amp; your XYZ's  Pot, Upstart, &amp; Terraforming are all used to help boost consistency. Blue Eyes are in there to help give better targets for the effect blue-eyes cards and just generally solid beatsticks to summon with REDM. Ash Blossom's only a one of b/c of a deal w/ the friends I've been playing with, but others are in the side deck (dunno what to take out for em anyways). Monster Reborn should be pocketed for resummoning REDM, as its effect can make or break the deck would only recommend using otherwise if it would close out the game.  Hope this writeup is sufficient for my first deck &amp; that y'all enjoy."

Envoy of Chaos should either remain in hand or in the grave, in order to buff any BLS Monster.

I felt the Trickstars were by far the cutest, so that's who I'm going with, lol. My strat for this deck is all burn, with the heart being Candina and its soul being Lycoris with MAJOR help from Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Droll &amp; Lock Bird. For my backfield I'm using the standard supports to get Links on the field asap with Dark Room, T Reincarnation, and Infinite Impertanance to help beef the burn and fill the gaps. My extra is all Trickstars with the notable ones being Bloom x3 and Divardis, Foxglove, and Holly Angel all being x2. I even threw in a Band Sween Guitar just for laughs (it's so pointless). This deck has a lot of flaws, especially in the power area, but I feel that the decks ability to constantly get needed cards on the field makes it very formidable. I feel this would also be a good tutorial deck for Link summoning and for countering burn decks."

This is where Norleras comes in and changes the game.  basic two-card Norleras combo goes like this:  You need a Tour Guide and a Burning Abyss monster card in hand  normal summon Tour Guide, special summon Doomdog  Link summon Cherubini, this will trigger Doomdog, search Norleras  Now you need Cir on the field, if you have one in hand, use Cherubini to send Libic to the GY to special summon Cir. Otherwise send Graff and special summon Cir from the deck.  next you special summon the Burning Abyss card you have in hand  Use Cir and your extra BA Monster to xyz summon Angineer (light fairy needed for Norleras)  Use Angineer and Cherubini to link summon Tenyi Berserker, this will trigger Cir, summon Cherubini back from the GY  Use Cherubini and Tenyi Berserker to summon Doublebyte Dragon, it'll have 3000 attack  Now special summon Norleras, banish Angineer, Tour Guide, Doomdog and a BA monster  Use Norleras effect, Doublebyte stays on the field since it's only affected by monster effects from other Link monsters"

HOWWW?!,"https://youtu.be/gLJmc9sUSv8  TCG and OCG banlist legal (TCG C1000 when?). Yes, you can sneak in Number C1000: Numeronius in regular Raidraptor combo. Same starter like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/optimized-tsx1-yacine656-raidraptor/"">OPTIMIZED TSX1/YACINE656 RAIDRAPTOR</a>, but cant start from normal summoned Mimicry Lanius. So we run Summoner Monk as an extra copy of Tribute Lanius. If we dont draw those starters, we need to make <strong>Wise Strix + lv4 monster</strong> (roughly 3 cards, because Summoner Monk and Tribute Lanius are valued as 2 monsters). Combo is in the video below.  Cairngorgon is there to direct opponent's card effect (target and destroy) to Numeronius (super very unlikely to happen, but hey Yugioh players can't read). Light Dragon @Ignister and Fog Blade are there to prevent Numeronius boardwipe if its disadvantageous. The staples/extenders are preferably spell (for Summoner Monk) but there is no DARK Winged-Beast extender in a form of spell. <strong>Why not regular lv4 extenders?</strong> It's because we need 4 dark monsters in GY for the PK RUM (needs long combo, can't start with Force Strix) while still having Strangle Lanius target in GY (Strangle Lanius locks to DARK and Numeronius is LIGHT, it means we have to use our Force Strix smartly).  It seems convoluted at first try, you'll understand it clearer after several games.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

DEUS VULT,"Crusadia is an OTK strategy which main focus is breaking boards with going 2nd cards like Kaijus and lightning storms and then using equimax with stuff like maximus and/or leonis to win the game. The next lines are for those who don't have any clue how crusadia is played.  So crusadia is like I said an OTK strategy if you play it the normal way, there are also many combo varients like crusadia guardragons. Crusadia also synergizes pretty well with mekk-knights, because the mekk-knights can special summon them selfs to the zone the crusadia links points to and the big boss monster is a mekk-knight and a crusadia. However we're focusing on the OTK varient, I just wanted to show you that there are many ways to actually play this deck.  So let's get started.  Let us start with the main deck monsters. The main deck monsters all share their 1st effect and have an own 2nd effect. Their 1st effect says that you can special summon them from your hand into a zone a link monster points to. The 2nd effects are:  Crusadia Maximus: He doubles a crusadia links battle damage if it battles an opponents monster, but all other monsters you control can't attack the turn it used it's effect. This boi is the easiest way to OTK your opponent and conquer ähh I mean get back the holy land. And it's an easy 3 off, irrelvant which version of crusadia you're playing.  Crusadia Arboria: She protects a crusadia monster from battle or card destruction, by banishing herself from the field or gy. She is a nice protection if you're going 1st and doesn't want to lose your equimax or avramax or if you're going 2nd and couldn't OTK so your monster can survive the next turn.  Crusadia Leonis: He gives an crusadia link monster piercing damage. Yeah... that's it. This can win you games if you're playing against stuff like..., I don't know Ghostrick perhaps? Or people who think that it's a good idea to summon their monsters in defense against crusadia... Anyway It's ration depends on which version you're playing, since you're playing the OTK version you have to play 3.  The next 2 are a little different, their effects can only be used if they are mormal or special summoned into a zone a link monster points to.  Crusadia Reclusia: He can destroy 1 crusadia card you control and 1 card your opponent controls. He is basically the boi who sacrifices himself for the team by blowing himself and a card from the opponent up, he is okay btw... just trust me on this. He is great to lure out some interuptions from the oppoenent.  Crusadia Draco: He can recycle a crusadia card from your gy. This gives you a little grind game and you can recycle the crusadia you normal summoned back so you can special summon it to a zone a link points to. You should play 3 copys of this cute little dragon in any crusadia varient.  Now Let's go to the Spells:  Crusadia Power: It's basically a miscellaneousaurus as a quick Spell for 1 crusadia monster. It can be used either to dodge handtraps or to protect equimax/avramax. A good turn 1 play you can make if you bricked is avramax + power pass. The only cards this could out are either a normal summoned monter with 3000 atk. or a Kaiju. So yeah the power of god should be a 3 off.  Crusadia Testament: This card can either draw you 3-4 cards or prevent yoir opponent from responding to your crusadia effects which is pretty good. It's a 1 off tho, because you can search it and you only use the draw power if you cannot OTK.  Crusadia Revival: This is the field Spell which gives all crusadia links 500 ATK. and It lets 1 of your link monsters attack all monsters your opponent controls. So it basically makes your equimax/avramax to an ultimate conductor tyrano.  And now Traps... or should I say trap?  Crusadia Krawler: This is the only relevant crusadia trap. It special summons itself as an monster and can search a World legacy Spell if it's special summoned to a zone a link moinster points to. This is your 1st turn option which let's you search a World legacy succesion or a World legacy World crown. You could also search World legacy World lance to protect your equimax in battle.  And now the extra deck:  Crusadia Magius: He a link-1 which let's you search a Crusadia monster if a effect monster is special summoned to a zone it points to.  Crusadia Regulex: He is a link-2 which let's you search a crusadia spell or trap if a effect monster is special summoned to a zone it points to.  Crusadia Equimax: He is a link-3 who gains the atk points of the monsters it points to. He can also negate an effect by tributing a crusadia monster and targeting the card it wants to negate. This is our OTK machine which will help us taking back the holy land!  Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax: He is a link-4 who is untargetable by your oppoenents card effects, your opponent can only target him for attacks. If avramax battles with a monster which was special summoned, it gains the attack points of the monster it battles. And if it's sent to the gy it can shuffle a card away. This card is a beast! Or atleast it was a beast when it came out. Nowadays there are many cards which doesn't target, like eldlich or zeus to name some, so the only way to let it really stay on the field is crusadia power.  So this were the archetype cards. Now I'm gonna show you some cards which aren't from the deck,but should be played.  Parrelel Xceed and Ranryu are some nice extenders for the deck. Xceed can special summon itself to a zone a link summoned link monster points to, so basically you link summon a link monster and on the summon of the link monster you can use the effect of xceed in your hand. It also has another effect that it can summon another copy of itself out of the deck. Ranryu can special summon itself if you control a spellcaster (magius or reclusia).  The last 3 cards I want to show you are: World Legacy Succesion, World Legacy World Crown and World Legacy World Lance.  World Legacy Succesion is basically a monster reborn. The only difference is that you have to special summon the monster to a zone a link points to.  World Legacy World Crown is a monster which special summons itself to a zone a link points to and it can negate effects from monsters specialed from the extra by tributing itself.  World Legacy World Lance is a monster which can be discarded if a link monster battles and if it's discarded your opponents monster loses 3000 Atk.  The last thing this deck has is the code breaker engine, but because it's not me who found it I thought I would give the person I have it from some support, so if you want to know how it works just watch this youtube video from Team COG:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTuSz_zn0kM  And now let us all take back the holy land!

This is post Ghosts from the Past (set is already out) and it is legal for the TCG at the moment so you can play this on DB rated and such. Dragunity got a lot of support via GHPA and I’ve seen a lot of lists on high rated DB which are actually viable. The deck is very strong, being able to make a million negates going 1st (includes extra deck lock, spell lock and the whole entire thing is nibiru proof) and can easily OTK going 2nd. And of course, since this is a Dragon theme deck, it has a ton of support/extenders, even some uncommonly played ones!! I know I said “Competitive” In the title and this deck is actually playable. If you make the right decisions, control your resources and know how to play this deck well (practice is key!), you can definitely take down some meta decks! I’m not saying the deck can top an LCS or anything but it has potential. Before I begin, I would like to thank everyone here at YGOPROdeck for the support in my last build with a detailed description (Atlantean Mermail)! I said in that build that if the post got 10+ likes I would do more like it and it ended up getting more than 10 (14 atm, might increase) so here I am! In this build I want to aim for 20+ likes, so if you want me to do more like this, make sure to give this post a thumbs up! Thanks again!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you want to see the combos, they are on my Youtube video, I also go over all the card choices and important plays there - I highly recommend you check it out for complete understanding on how to play the deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1JLHTN1Irw</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Main deck Cards -</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>3x </span>Dragunity Senatus<span> - This is your main starter, with any Dragunity discard you can equip Phalanx or Course directly from your deck (why would you even think of doing remus lol) which can then be used (one of the tuners + Senatus) to go into Gae Dearg (full combo basically).</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span> 2x </span>Dragunity Legatus<span> - This is an amazing extender which you can use to extend plays and this card can also be used to make Gae Dearg with a Remus and a discard, very important card but only 2 is needed. </span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Dux</b><span> - This is the last Dragunity Winged-Beast you are running, it’s great for recovery and can be used as a replacement for Senatus if you open Ravine + Phalanx (ravine searches dux). It’s just great and is only needed at 1 copy. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Dragunity Remus</b><span> - Oh yeah, we’re into the Dragons now!! Remus is a great starter (1.5 card Gae Dearg w/discard) and is also a great extender since it does not use your normal summon!! Counting Remus, you have 7 copies of Dragon Ravine in your deck. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Dragunity Phalanx </b><span>- This is a solid card, a very essential combo piece you want to see in hand, therefore I’m maximizing on it. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Dragunity Course</b><span> - This is just as good as Phalanx except you can’t synchro summon into crystal wing or savage using it and therefore I’m only running 2 copies. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Arma Mystletainn</b><span> - Essential combo piece, not exactly a brick if drawn because you can just use his effect and summon him out (he’s basically a Red MD for Dragunity), send him to the GY by some means and then use Dragunity Glow (used to search this dude in the combo) and even add him back from the Grave to use his effect again (soft once per turn).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Arma Leyvaten </b><span>- Another essential combo piece, it’s also not a brick if drawn because you can just discard it and opening it will let you summon something else with Atum (it’s an xyz version of elpy) which you can take advantage of. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</b><span> - This is an awesome extender, it’s especially great because it can “monster reborn” a dragon from the grave, which is especially useful because all the Dragunity monster’s effects are soft once per turn effects!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Odd-eyes Revolution Dragon</b><span> - This card is insane, it’s pendulum effect can be used to “monster reborn” any Dragunity synchro from the grave to trigger their effects again!! Just Imagine reviving a Gae Dearg off of this, the advantage you gain is insane! </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Amorphage Lechery</b><span> - Is usually on your endboard and can be searched off of Dearg, it makes your board droplet/dark ruler proof and it serves as an amazing floodgate. Not really a brick since drawing it allows you to search something else with Dearg.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Amorphage Goliath</b><span> - This is always supposed to be on your end board and it is a buster lock basically, you summon this guy off of elpy. This is a brick so keep that in mind.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Blackwing Zephros the Elite</b><span> - Oh my lord this card is insane, it can be searched off of Dearg and immediately discarded (basically milled off of dearg) and can also bounce ravine (or something else in other combos) back into the hand and summon itself back onto the field! Only reason you play 1 is because it’s effect is once per duel sadly :(</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Mist Valley Baby Roc</b><span> - It’s basically a free summon (off of Dearg) and is used in combos as well. You need 2 at least but you can play 3 as well. It’s effect is not once per turn. It’s also an extender if drawn because the deck discards a LOT. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Ash Blossom</b><span> - generic disruption/hand trap that is great against any matchup.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Lancea</b><span> - Another hand trap you are playing, it is really good against the current meta (counters literally all the decks) and therefore I’m running it at 3. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x</span><b> Dragon Ravine</b><span> - This can search any Dragunity, should be very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Glow</b><span> - used in the combo, is not a brick if drawn (is actually an extender) and can be used to do some pretty crazy shenanigans. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Terraforming</b><span> - To search ravine which can search Dragunity monsters.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x</span><b> Monster Reborn</b><span> - Amazing extender, it’s main purpose is to reborn Gae Dearg or a Dragunity synchro for gaining advantage since all the effects are a soft once per turn</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Triple Tactics talent</b><span> - this card is busted, it’s great for both going 1st and second and has 3 very useful effects. I like to consider this a part of the handtraps/removal section. </span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck -</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>1x</span> Gae Dearg<span> - This is the heart and soul of the deck, only needed at 1 because you basically just reborn him from the graveyard a million times for advantage :)</span></b></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Areadbhair - </b><span>this is the in-theme boss monster you usually have in your end board, don’t worry, it’s very easy to make w/Dragunity Arma Leyvaten!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Ascalon </b><span> - amazing card for breaking boards going 2nd. Keep in mind the banish effect is not once per turn and that it does not target or destroy. This dude can also be easily made w/Dragunity Arma Leyvaten!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Barcha </b><span>- god this card is busted! It can equip any number of Dragunity monsters from the GY onto itself making it literally (up to 4) extra summons!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Romulus </b><span> - Can search any Dragunity backrow (ravine or glow in our case) and is a very key combo piece!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Seal</b><span> - literally all dragon decks play this for high impact interruption </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Darksteel</b><span> - This is good because it can reborn Gae dearg and it locks you but Dragunity does not even need to link summon anyways lol (you do the gaurdragon and romulus stuff before making this)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Triple Burst</b><span> - Used in the combo to help guardragon plays, it’s also a solid link monster.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x</span><b> Elpy</b><span> - needed for the combo, can special any dragon from the deck</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Pisty </b><span>- also needed for combos, can special back Gae Dearg</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragon of Atum</b><span> - It’s another elpy!!

Amazon Prime Video today confirmed that it has ordered two more seasons of the acclaimed TV series ""Invincible"", created by Robert Kirkman (""The Walking Dead""). <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/theconjuring3/</a>  &nbsp;  After an almost unanimously acclaimed first season, there is after all a bad review of just over fifty on RottenTomatoes, so it was not super surprising that the bloody superhero series would have another season. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/f92021/</a>  &nbsp; <div>Men vi tackar givetvis för att Amazon nu ger seriens skapare möjligheten att planera de två kommande säsongerna på bästa möjliga sätt. För den som inte har hunnit bekanta sig med ""Invincible"" ännu, så bygger handlingen på Kirkmans egna serietidningar med samma namn. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/demonslayermugentrain/</a></div> <div></div> <div>I centrum står den 17-årige pojken Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) som är son till vår planets starkaste superhjälte; Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons). Genom en hel drös oväntade vändningar får vi tittare se hur Mark blir superhjälten ""Invincible"" och börjar gå i sin pappas enorma fotsteg. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/wrath-of-man/</a></div> <div></div> <div>The feeling is a bit like a mix of thinking about Spider-Man being Superman's son - and it was Quentin Tarantino who got to use an endless layer of blood, well-written characters and incredibly detailed sci-fi (completely without limits) ...<a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/nomadland/</a></div> <div></div> <div>for to sew together the best possible story.

Don't play handtraps since I gave up on playing competitive and want to have fun but hand traps can be placed easily. AIQ would be first to go but I want to try to make it work since it seems quirky. You can also remove optimization and some a.i reborn/formud skipper... <strong>there is a lot of room for handtraps.</strong>  1st turn board: Arrival with danmari in grave, Firewall dragon darkfluid with three counters, and firewall dragon co-linked to both or a code talker link with cynet conflict set in backrow. Some combination of any othese really.  2nd turn: Destroy opponents field with wind pegasus and water leviathan then kill with firewall darkfluid or accesscode or something that is cool.

I've finally actually made this deck, and it's been a lot of fun. So in all truth and honesty, it doesn't play like Shaddoll Dogmatika, Invoked, or any of the other good Shaddoll builds, and I don't think is quite as good, but it's ridiculously fun to play. Anyway, getting right into it, I'm gonna re-explain the combos from a different Orcust deck I made. Then I'll go into the Shaddoll-incorporating ones (patience, ma dudes.)  &nbsp;  So first I'm going to explain the basic engines of this deck, so I can just refer to them later and save a lot of time--  First: PK engine (starting with The Phantom <a data-name=""Knights of Torn Scales"">Knights of Torn Scales </a>in hand. 1. Normal summon Torn Scales, discard a card to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> from deck to GY. 2. Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>. 3. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> from deck to hand; this triggers Torn Scales' effect in GY, special summoning itself from the GY. 4. Since you now control Torn Scales, you can special summon Silent Boots from hand. Now you have 3 creatures on field.  Second: Orcust engine (starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) 1. Normal summon Girsu, sending <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck to GY 2. Activate Girsu's effect, creating a token to both your and your opponent's field. -(I'm going to stop the engine there, since there's a couple alternate routes you can go)  &nbsp;  Combos:  Orcust A: 1. Do the Orcust engine, banishing <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from GY to send <a data-name=""World Legacy - World Wand"">World Legacy - World Wand</a> from deck to GY, then banish World Wand to summon back Orcust Knightmare. 2.Use Knightmare, Girsu, and your token to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, activating his effect to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> from deck to GY and set <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> directly from your deck. Banish Ancient Cloak to add another Fog Blade and set it for two negates. :  Orcust B: 1. Do the Orcust engine, banishing Orcust Knightmare from GY to send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> from deck to GY. Use Girsu and your token to Link Summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a>, shuffling your banished Knightmare into the deck and setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> to the field. 2. Banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to revive <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>, then use Galatea to XYZ summon Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star--on summon equip your banished Cymbal Skeleton to Ding. 3. Use Dingirsu and Girsu to Link Summon I:P Masquerena. On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to revive Dingirsu and send a card your opponent controls to the GY, then you can I:P into Unicorn and shuffle an additional card.  &nbsp;  PK  A:  1. Do the PK engine, using Almiraj and Torn Scales to Link Summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, then use I:P and <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, activating Rusty's effect to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> to GY to set <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> directly from deck; banish Silent Boots to add another Fog Blade and set it. : (deja vu, anyone?)  PK B: 1. Do the PK engine, using Torn Scales and Silent Boots to link summon Cherubini, <a data-name=""Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> from deck to GY; Wendi's effect triggers, special summoning a Shaddoll Monster face-down from your deck. 2. Use Cherubini and Almiraj to link summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, activating his effect to send Shaddoll Fusion from deck to GY and fusing him and your face-down Shaddoll Monster into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. 3. Banish Silent Boots from the GY to add a Fog Blade from deck to hand, setting it.  PK C (starting with a fusion card in hand): 1. Normal summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>, discard a card to send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY. 2. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY, adding Silent Boots, then summoning him from hand. Use him and Torn Scales to link summon Cherubini. 3. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> from deck to GY: she triggers, letting you summon a Shaddoll Monster from your deck face-down. 4. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> from deck to hand; Torn Scales triggers, summoning back himself. Set, then activate Shade. 5. Use Torn Scales and Cherubini to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>; activate Rusty's effect, send a Torn Scales from deck to GY to set a Fog Blade directly from deck. 6. Activate the fusion card in hand, fusing Shade Brigandine and your face-down Shaddoll Monster into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. --Note: If you have a dark monster in hand, you can add a Fog Blade off of Silent Boots, instead of Shade  PK Orcust (starting with <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> and <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) 1. Normal summon Torn Scales, discarding Girsu to send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY. Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>. 2. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add Silent Boots from deck to hand; Torn Scales triggers, summoning itself from GY. Special summon Silent Boots from hand. 3. Use Torn Scales and Silent Boots to link summon Cherubini, activating his effect to  send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> from deck to GY. 4. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add Shade Brigandine, setting him in the S/T zone under Almiraj. Banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY, special summoning Girsu from GY between Almiraj and the set Shade Brigandine; Girsu sends <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck to GY, as well as becoming a Tuner. 5. Banish Knightmare from GY, send <a data-name=""World Legacy - World Wand"">World Legacy - World Wand</a> from deck to GY; banish World Wand, summoning back Knightmare. 6. Use Knightmare and Almiraj to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a>, using her effect to shuffle World Wand into the deck to set <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> to the field. 7. Use Galatea to XYZ summon Dingirsu, equipping banished Cymbal Skeleton. Use Dingirsu and Cherubini to link summon Rusty Bardiche, sending a PK monster from deck to GY and setting a <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>. 8. Activate <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>, using him and Girsu to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>; he equips Galatea from GY to himself. --On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to special summon Dingirsu into a zone Rusty Bardiche points to--Dingirsu sends a card your opponent controls to the GY, and Rusty destroys one.  That's it for the combos so far; if there are any cool ones you figure out, please leave a comment.  Anyway, moving onto some card explanations, first I'll be going over <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Golden Lord</a>. I got inspiration for putting him in here from Joshua Friedman, who got 3-4th place in the recent Remote Duel Extravaganza. He's got a surprising amount of utility in this deck, as being a target for Shaddoll Fusion (to summon Construct.) Due to lack of time, that's all I have to say for Eld right now, but I encourage you to try him out. If you read my last Orcust deck, you remember Dark Hole? Well, I'm still playing it (albeit in the side deck) so FiGhT mE  &nbsp;  Overall, I feel like El Shaddoll Winda is a bit unrepresented in this deck explanation; with easy access to Cherubini and Anaconda, I've seen that you're almost always able to make her in a game.

We have a considerably broader focus and many different characters that are spread out in very different places.  <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/calyfilmpoland/comments/n2iuiw/obecność_3_na_rozkaz_diabła_2021_cały_film_filmy/</a>  - Over time, I'm pretty sure that ""Invincible"" will be able to take us on adventures and tell stories that would have required 20 Marvel movies in MCU, to even get close to the scale and variety we want to be able to offer in one and the same TV series. We will explore all corners of our world and all parts of what it means to be a superhero in it. So, what sets us apart is, above all, the ability to do all of this. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/calyfilmpoland/comments/n2jkit/kosmiczny_mecz_nowa_era_2021_cały_film_filmy_i/</a>  The new ""Children of the Corn"" follows ""a psychopathic 12-year-old girl in a small town who persuades all the other children for a bloody massacre of all corrupt adults"".

The strategy here is to xyz summon as much as possible and otk. The deck has a possibility of summoning 5 xyz in 1 turn. I've removed Ogopogo due to the fact that I find it slowing me down. I needed to switch it with handtraps.  <strong>Combos</strong>:  Going first: If you have BEWD and Alt BEWD summon Alt BEWD then summon Seyfert (if you have it) discard blue-eyes with Seyfert eff and add Galactic Spiral Dragon, summon Galactic Spiral Dragon and then summon Coach and use his eff in order to draw (thrice per turn) cannot enter BP if Coach eff was used until EP. Try summoning your other xyz like (Heavenly Dragon, Photonlord and/or Sky Prison make sure to read their effs). Finally end the combo with using Nebula and 1 other lvl 8 Dragon monster by using it's eff and summon Number 97 and use it's eff to summon Hope Harbringer by attaching Tachyon to it. The reason to end the combo with 97 is because you cannot special summon any more monsters here. If you're opponent doesn't use spells summon Hearth instead or whatever xyz you need. It's best to refrain from summoning Dingirsu, Full Armor, Galaxy Cipher or Cipher Blade on you first turn as they will be useful resources on your next turn (Unless you got nothing else to summon).  &nbsp;  Going second: Summon any of these (if you need) Dingirsu (Use his eff to send 1 card of your opponent to gy), Zeus (after BP use his eff *if* you need to get rid of cards) and/or Galaxy Cipher Dragon (read his eff) summon Full Armor or Cipher Blade on it (if you summon Full Armor use it's eff to pop 1 face-up card your opponent controls then summon Cipher Blade on top of it use it's eff to pop 1 card on the field. Finally if you see a chance to otk just attack with your big cards or summon Number 97 and summon Number 100 use it's eff and atk with it. Remember 97 eff doesn't allow you to special summon anymore monsters and you can only attack with the monster you summoned by Number 97's eff.  Depends on hand do whatever you have do this is just an example.  Update: New cards have been added and some changes."

They started out as a way to keep ""Chaos"" cards like ""<a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"">Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</a>"" in check a those years ago, but while the game evolved into a direction where such counters where not really necessary anymore, the archetype is stuck in its ways with the newest support card rather supporting the ""Koa'ki Meiru"" variant called ""Rock Stun"". Nonetheless. I tried my best making something with this group of beatsticks and outdated mechanics, and here is the result.</p> <p>First, before I start listing my monster choices, there are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"". Those are very much necessary, since the ""Koa'ki Meirus"" work with an upkeep cost system that either requires you to reveal a card with a certain monster type from your hand (unless you have one of the various exceptions) or discard one ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" to keep your monster from blowing itself up. You can there search for and use the ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"", use the ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" to give your monsters protection from the destruction effect or simply use them as Xyz or Link material before they implode.</p> <p>The monster choices are as follows: Three ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" are absolutely paramount, since they are both the only thing that comes close to swarming since they summon other ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters from the deck, as well as your best way to go into Link-2 and Rank 4 Xyz monsters; two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak"">Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak</a>"" can inflict solid damage to the opposing life points and interact very well with ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>""; one ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Drago"">Koa'ki Meiru Drago</a>"" serves to counter Light- and Dark-based decks; two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Crusader"">Koa'ki Meiru Crusader</a>"" as recovery tools, something to reveal for ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" during the End Phase, as searchable monsters via ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</a>"" and as a passable beater; a small ""Rock Stun"" engine with two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Overload"">Koa'ki Meiru Overload</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"", which give some Stun options as well as further summons and searches; and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"", who I personally find very helpful against combo decks that like to end on large Special Summoned boards.</p> <p>I already mentioned a sizeable amount of the Spell cards, like ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" (as cost for some card effects and to keep your monsters alive), ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" (searcher and destruction protection), ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</a>"" (another searcher) and ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"" (ATK steroid), but there are some more. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" is helpful since it can clear the board of threats, which is something that does not come naturally to ""Koa'ki Meirus""; two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" for card draw; one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" primarily for reviving ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" but also to (re-)gain Link and/or Xyz materials; the copies of ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault"">Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault</a>"" allow the deck to search ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"" by targeting ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Crusader"">Koa'ki Meiru Crusader</a>""; ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tensu"">Fire Formation - Tensu</a>"" is help for further swarming; and the single ""Double or Nothing!"" is simply part of the ""Utopia Double"" engine. The Trap cards are basically meant to serve as floodgates and hurt the opponent more than they do you like ""<a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a>"" to keep effect monsters at bay temporarily or ""<a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>"" to do the same in a more permanent fashion. Both cards can also affect your own monsters, but due to ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monster starting out with high ATK and gaining a sizeable boost via ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"", you can simply decide to go full caveman and simply attack with your beatsticks if necessary. The last card is ""<a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>"", which can also hurt your board, but is oftentimes not that bad for you since most of your monsters are Earth Attribute.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features some Rank 4 Xyz monsters as the easiest option to go into: A sizeable ""Utopia"" engine featuring two ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>"" serve as solid beatsticks; ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" can search the ""Rock Stun"" monsters; ""<a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King</a>"" is more effect negation and can be summoned via the deck's Beast-Warrior monsters; ""<a data-name=""Number 82: Heartlandraco"">Number 82: Heartlandraco</a>"" can make use of the ""Fire Formations"" staying on the field and can prove to be a solid direct attacker; ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" can get rid of monster you cannot destroy; ""<a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>"" recycles monsters for card draw; ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can shoot the opposing life points when the opponent is close to death and potentially provides another beater. The Rank 5 ""<a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a>"" can make use of any Rank 4 monster you play and might prove helpful as a 2500 ATK beater with piercing damage. The Link options are simply the two destroy effect ""Knightmare"" monsters and ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a>"" is simply another utility tool.</p> <p>While there are some fun combinations like ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak"">Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak</a>"" as a damage tool or simply blasting the opposing board with ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"", it has to be said that this deck is at the bottom end of the ladder. It is easy to counter, has little options to play through counters and/or negates and struggles setting up OTKs despite being a beatdown deck with high ATK values. Still, ""Koa'ki Meiru"" is an archetype in the game and therefore something that is worth looking at, if only for inspiration.

Instead I have opted for a small shaddoll engine to go with it, seeing as you can dump the fusions with claw, and the main deck cards with cannon. Claw is you main playmaker for the deck, you use it to combo off by dumping whatever extra deck card you want at the given moment, however this isn't good because you have to do so by battle. This deck is just worse dogmatika and that's why I love it.  Feedback is welcome as always."

Playing this build online is pretty fun and what I lack in brute force I make up for in my ability to make boards that will build themselves after they’re destroyed, instantly.  The deck I have here is the best form I’ve made yet for Despia but I haven’t gotten into handtraps yet because I’m still working on the archetype and the things I can do with it.  I did beat a zoolich deck with this build though (and in the process of that I had to survive two zeus in a row which I handed like a boss) so I feel it probably has a lot of potential and probably just needs a little love and work to be good.  What makes this deck good in the end though is that it’s extremely efficient with resources and card advantage."

Also good for special summon fodder. Pairs well with Lonefire for basically infinite tributes (almost).  <em>Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy: </em>Use her to get more plant monsters on the field. Very good for Link fodder and XYZ fodder. Also a good boss.  <em>Erika the Rikka Fairy: </em>Plant support discards itself upon attack against another Plant monster you control, adding 1000 ATK/DEF until end of turn. Pretty good with other Rikka cards that require tributes. Also pairs well with <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> to summon itself.  <em>Mudan the Rikka Fairy:</em> A searcher for Rikka spells and traps like Rikka Tranquility. Good for this deck in specific. Pairs well with Evil Thorn to summon it from your hand.  <em>Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy:</em> Basic special summon XYZ/Link fodder. Helps reduce level by 2 for XYZ.  <em>Primula the Rikka Fairy:</em> Basic special summon XYZ/Link fodder. Helps increase level by 2 for XYZ.  <em>Traptrix Genlisea:</em> Use to get out the traps first turn if possible. You want to go first with this deck. Pair with Dionaea late-game to get out more traps on the field.  <em>Traptrix Myrmeleo: </em>Used to get ""Hole"" Trap Cards in your hand pretty fast. Pairs with Dionaea. Run more Dionaea if you want to run more Traptrixes in your deck rather than Rikkas.  <em>Traptrix Dionaea:</em> Used to Special Summon monsters, specifically Traptrix ones, from your GY. Also helps get recovery traps from GY. Pair with Myrmeleo to clear traps and spells, or pair with Mantis to search for Myrmeleo and get traps to your hand.  <em>Traptrix Mantis: </em>Used to search Traptrix. Basic card, 2nd effect helps save traps with a Quick Effect. Also good for setting down traps you want to use later.  <em>Lonefire Blossom:</em> Pairs with basically every single monster. Good card.  <em>Evil Thorn:</em> Pairs with itself and Lonefire Blossom as tribute fodder. Good for links as well because it summons itself up to 2 extra times.  <em>One for One:</em> Searches for Rikka Petal.  <em>Bottomless Trap Hole/Deep Dark Trap Hole/Time Space Trap Hole/Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare/Void Trap Hole:</em> Will help you immensely in destroying some setup monsters and strong monsters. If you prefer Torrential Tribute (with Fury of Kairyu-Shin) or Grand Horn of Heaven, that is totally okay too because it works well with Rikka cards.  <em>Trap Trick: </em>A go-to setup for Hole cards.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  <em>Teardrop the Rikka Queen: </em>Very good card to clear your enemy's field and make them cry.  <em>Kanzashi the Rikka Queen:</em> Protection for plants.  <em>Traptrix Allomerus: </em>Good for taking your opponent's monsters and also for Traptrix Support. Gets Traptrix cards from the GY onto the field.  <em>Silent Honor ARK: </em>Good for taking your opponent's monsters. Fun card. Works with Traptrix cards.  <em>Rikka Queen</em> <em>Strenna: </em>Works with Traptrix to summon a higher Rikka monster and gives it more materials. Very funny.  <em>Traptrix Rafflesia:</em> Works with Traptrix to get more Hole cards (essentially) by sending them to the GY. Makes them a Quick Effect.  <em>Saryuja Skull Dread: </em>Generally helpful with Special Summoning and such. Also (essentially) mulls your hand without having you discard. Good in general but not exactly the optimal play.  <em>Traptrix Sera: </em>Great Traptrix support, helps get out a ton of different Traptrix every time you activate a Normal Trap.  <strong>Side Board:</strong>  <em>Break-Off Trap Hole: </em>Link support. Helps that the Traptrix cards are unaffected, essentially making it a Raigeki.  <em>Floodgate Trap Hole: </em>Disables the enemy and cripples their monsters.  <em>Mirror</em> <em>Force:</em> The reason I have trust issues. A very good card. Could be a win condition.  <em>Rikka Sheet:</em> Takes control of their monsters. Good for Link fodder.  <em>Rikka Tranquility:</em> Summons 2 plants from your GY if done right. Have 1 on your field to make it work.  <em>Storming Mirror Force:</em> For when Mirror Force is no longer valid."

Due to the consistency cards the deck can play through some interruptions, but cant really do anything about Nib unless you go for Crystal Wing during your turn. This is unlikely to be possible due to Crimson's restriction."

Like damn, I think people should try them out. Especially with a Dogmatika engine they could be broken. Additionally the main core is pretty cheap and the card i have in the side counters Eldlich and Dogmatika pretty well. Solid deck. i built this one to be control focused and shit out beeg ships to shoot people down along with a huge trap line up. I included a Verte package to go into Rainbow Neos, not Dragoon, because i'm not a degenerate. Because this is so cheap I might just build it IRL."

I am saving up cash so i can blow my load to buy the Vision Hero engine IRL and build this, because i hav emost of it already. The deck sucks without either V-Heroes or Evil Heroes. That junk aside, it's a fun combo deck that can put out  huge boards of beaters that wipe out the opponent. I had a Hero build before so I redid it- a few things I changed out were things like Desires. Desires is way too bricky as it can banish important combo pieces like Mali a ton, so I cut it and found that i didn't have space for any more draw power. Fire Flint Lady is a good tech if you can find space for it as it helps with field swarming and combos."

TRISHULA BANISH FOR 3, LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO","ive been binging War of the Worthless and the Genex player made an amazing deck that can spam out Synchros really well, so I decided to try something like that. This build is designed to turbo out Synchros, using cards like Dai, Double Summon, and Overseer to help put more bodies on board than Genex are usually capable of doing so.  Additionally, I included a bit of Synchrons and Halq to help with this. The extra deck is just a fuck ton of Syncros to spam out and make. You can also play Fleur and/or Black Salvo if you want, it's a good tech. For some reasona  few of the Genex cards are expensive for no reason despite them being some of the worst???? it's fucking weird This deck is surprisingly strong and I love it. I reccomend trying it out, honestly. Also Genex has really cool lore lol"

Nearly every monster has a special summoning condition, meaning you can easily swarm a fuck ton of monsters onto the board and climb into huge Synchros. Additionally, due to the T.G's all having varied types and levels, you can play f o u r generic searchers, and that's just for the T.G's Fucking four. Overall, T.G's are surprisingly fucking insane, and can perform incredibly powerful Halq combos and beat people's shit in. also, the main core is incredibly cheap, under 30 dollars, which is really nice.

You are able to achieve that in many ways by having atleast 2 of your main cores, Servant of Endymion &amp; Magical Abductor, and Spell Cards for Spell Counters.  You can use alot of Draw Power for this deck, mainly by Spell Cards' and Magicians' Soul. Allure of Darkness is great, since most of the Main Deck monsters are DARK Attribute. The Spellbook Engine is also the best way for your combos, searching Spellbook of Secrets with Spellbook Magician of Prophecy and Normal Summoning the same in order to search for Spellbook of Knowledge for hand increase.  Instant Fusion is only Main Deck for Millennium-Eyes, by using him and other Spellcasters for Selene and being able to Special Summon Millennium-Eyes during your opponent's turn for a monster disruption.  Day-Breaker can destroy your Magician's Restage, being able to search for Magician's Right Hand.  Many other combos can be developed, try setting up your combo <div></div>"

Unchained benefits from Ecole de Zone destroying your monsters and replacing them with Mask Tokens, since they float into more monsters.  &nbsp;  So I made this go-first Unchained deck that focuses on controlling the board.
