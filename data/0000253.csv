Surpringly consistent. Really really wants to go first though. Not very resilient if they get their special summons or a raigeki or something. That is, however, if they even get to play in the first place :)  -You have pretty powerful board set ups for what the deck is about. Ties of the brethren really makes the deck (and moon mirror shield puts the nail in the coffin), it's all built around that card. Brothers in arms making the enemy cry, but that's fine, we're (nearly) all aqua, we'll thrive with their tears and feed on them :)  -Nothing meta of course, very weak to interruption (read ash blossom) and destruction of any kind (besides battle), and way weaker going second. You will make people miserable pretty consistently when going first however, if that's the way you have fun, this deck is pure pain for the opponent :)  -You can still special summon so as to make your opponent hate you even more. Dweller (your best friend - cheats the 1800 atk limit letting you attack over everything all the while boosting your board's attack power and offering you protection) and abyssalacia both notably are always available for you to summon no matter which lock you have up. Make them feel pain as you do what they wish they could :)  -Don't be afraid to normal summon testudo erat numen (or barrier statue) if that is your only play, always if you have aquarium stage/ties of the brethren/moon mirror shield/mirror force of course, but you should also consider it without any of them. It can still mess the opponent up a little bit and can buy you a whole turn. Let them feel the wrath of the turtle ! :)  (still working out some ratios, namely the left arm offerings and the level 4s, should also consider called by the grave)  (I have a most likely more powerful and more consistent version of the deck in the works with the same idea, with icejades as your level 4 aqua monsters, however I am not done with it for one, and icejades aren't out on master duel yet, may post it anyway ! Worst comes to worst, on a content update for the game where icejades would be added)  (I also have a list which tries to make transmodify work on top of ties of the brethren and thus have more ways to get out a summon lock either through the barrier statue or the other testudo and also both testudo monsters are mostly a perfect special summon lock together. However, while cute on paper, it really just makes the deck less consistent and more convoluted. Also, the other testudo is awkward against 1800 beatsticks - which are legion - as he dies to them in battle even though it is mutual destruction whereas our cute tiny one doesn't bat an eye if in defense mode. The ""perfect lock"" also messes you up a little bit as you can't special summon either if you pull it off - read ""can't get dweller out"". If I ever make it work I'll post it/edit this deck)  <em>~tortoise was god</em>  &nbsp;"

(read ""","Actual description incoming (maybe) - <span>couple advice/things to keep in mind below the bullet points</span>  <span>Meant as a fun deck</span>  <strong>Couple bullet points I will expand on (non exhaustive) when I have the time/motivation :</strong>  -I don't even know why this isn't a thing, I actually took some time to think about how to make chain burn as consistent and resilient as possible (tried to make the deck as good as possible as a friend really wanted to play a burn deck), and it dawned on me : paleozoic, it really just makes too much sense to me. The paleo cards add tons of chain links for more burn and easily triggered accumulated fortune, they give draw power themselves through pikaia and opabinia, and it gives protection with their own bodies and dinomischus or canadia, even hallucigenia. And to top all that, they also give power plays with (pretty darn easy) access to zeus and toadally awesome which is no joke ! It is no meta deck of course, but it flows very nicely and feels great to play. I do mostly mean that paleo burn doesn't even show up when you look for burn decks. Again, nothing meta, but boy is it fun !  -You could add another dinomischus or even a third one, but after some testing, I do mostly care about the name (all being different so as not to interfere with chain strike and accumulated fortune), which is why you have one of each, in order to get all of the chain links while not preventing the activation of accumulated fortune and chain strike, which are still the core of the deck. I do still have two of marrella and pikaia, as the former really sets everything up and the draw from the latter is a bit too good. Usually one dinomischus has been more than fine, especially as you can search for it (and activate it from hand after you tutor it !) with opabinia.  -Other than that pretty usual list, but the paleozoics really make the deck what it is. Toadally awesome is, of course, awesome. And again, zeus is really easy to get out with the deck, and you don't even have any drawback from it as you can always chain all your spells/traps, because, you know, this is chain burn we are talking about, so you can still set everything and the 3000 atk against an empty board, in a heavy burn deck, is very spooky. Just cleaning the board lalone ets you get many more turns, hopefully enough to burn them down ! Overall, very happy with how it turned out, which is why I am sharing  <span>Couple advice/ideas :</span>  -As much as possible, avoid setting multiple of waboku and threatening roar, each one being a whole extra turn. Do it however if it lets you summon two paleos from the graveyard, which opens up a zeus/opabinia/toadally awesome. Also, remember that the paleozoic traps as monsters are unffacted by monster effects, making them pretty darn resilient and hard to get rid of when under the protection of waboku or threatening roar, so no stress and easy xyz plays on your turn !  -Don't forget that you cannot burn after card of demise for the rest of the turn and cannot special summon the turn you want to use it (even previously in the turn), be wary !  -Don't forget either that accumulated fortune and chain strike cannot be activated if multiple cards with the same name have been activated earlier in the chain - which is why you run all the paleozoic traps. Basically, if you have both marrellas and/both pikaias in the grave, don't activate both before using accumulated fortune/chain strike. Remember as well that you <em><span>can</span> </em>activate two chain strikes or two accumulated fortunes in the same chain, as the second one only sees one activated, thus no two same names  -Lava golem could be an interesting option, but usually you don't care about the opponent's board, most of the time they can't even attack you and negates aren't too annoying, if anything giving you more chain links. It could get rid of some annoying cards all the while burning though. Still debating - while it does admitedly add power and the potential extra burn to finish the opponent off - whether it is fluff that you don't really need at the cost of consistency  Happy burning ! You'll love them hating you  <em>~ paleo fitness, burn all of that fat !</em> (read ""your opponent's thick layer of hp they really don't need"" be a good friend, help them get rid of it !)"

Also, the skull servants would become more of a gimmick and somewhat getting in the way of some consistency in regard to the ""meta plays"" only adding a big (BIG) beater (well, giving easier OTKs isn't something to just dismiss though)  -Deck OTKs nicely, not too much disruptive power however, despite the eldlich package.

Actually have a non impcantation nekroz dogmatika list (with the usual 40 cards / without herald of perfection - which also cuts eva and lee) which is mostly stronger technically (?) but weaker to interruption as a counterpart. Neither list feel less consistent than the other one. The straight nekroz dogmatika does have a better turn 1 usually though (bar too much disruption, again, weaker to interruption than the impcantation list which really lets you bounce back and back). Still debating which list I like best  -Despite having baronne de fleur, this list is meant to follow master duel's banlist. Read ""one nadir's servant, two benten and two called by the grave""  -Herald of perfection is usually summoned the following turn, first turn usually sets up for it while trying to build as disruptive a board as possible. You do get it out first turn sometimes. Technically you mostly always can, but without fairies in hand. First turn sets that up, herald seals the deal the following turn  -Lee the world chalice fairy is there as an extra monster you get search with eva, as well as being a recurring fairy monster that you can add back to your hand from the grave, as you barely run any fairies for herald (you tutor for them easily though). She can also get rid of an impcantation monster on the field to let you use the extra deck if need be, if you want to go for a fusion play with verte anaconda/super poly/fallen of albaz or even a level 10 synchro play (which is pretty easy to get out - the deck <em>is</em> a bit weaker on master duel due to the lack of baronne de fleur for that reason)  -If you didn't need to use your normal summon, vanity's ruler is rather easy to get out turn 1, sometimes at the cost of a negate though  -Still working on some techs/cuts/ratio, so far feels pretty nice though. Able to compete with the likes of swordsoul somewhat convincingly (haven't tested on master duel itself yet, don't have all the cards, list is built with master duel's banlist however - I know technically baronne de fleur isn't out on master duel yet). I have mostly tested against swordsoul tenyi outside of master duel, as I wanted a tough competitor, and really go to war against something a minimum meta. Against them, nearly always win going first which makes me hopeful for the idea. Mostly lose going second though which makes me worries. Have had going second wins however, but you do have to put up some kind of fight. Against weaker (read non meta decks), the list has been wrecking nicely.

Master duel banlist. Huge rant. Much wow.  41-9 (82,"I know the list is nothing revolutionnary, but I feel like the couple changes I made actually have a pretty great impact. While not a pure personal tech as well, the three cards zombie world ""engine"", even though only three cards, really changes the whole dynamic of the deck. They may be only three cards, but everything in the deck tutors for them, making them omnipresent and actually play in every game - which kinda matters a lot in a single game format.  I'dd add in a gameplay section but let's face it, this is still eldlich, deck is pretty self explanatory and easy to pilot. Go hard on zombie world though.  <strong>Summary</strong>  -Record / going first vs going second -Why the zombie world focus ? <span>(the crazy impact just three cards have)</span> -Techs and choices <span>(introduction/follow-up to the zombie world focus ft rivalry of warlords + <span><span>small rant on</span> <span><strong>building for a single game format</strong></span></span></span> <span> gozen match - summon limit - foolish burial goods - necroface)</span> -Footnotes / short thoughts on extravagance vs prosperity  <strong>Record</strong>  17-3 record from gold 5 to platinum (85% winrate) 24-6 from platinum 5 to platinum 1 (80% winrate) Overall season 2 record end tally : 41-9 (82% winrate) 1st vs 2nd split : 19-2 going first (90.4% winrate) 22-7 going second (75.8% winrate)  I would like to point out that the deck, while aimed at going first and much stronger in that position, deals very well with going second.  The list is a pretty conventionnal eldlich list, however with still a couple techs and personal choices which have actually won me some games and I don't think have cost me any (granted, of course, my sample size is pretty small) and centered around zombie world.  <strong>Why the zombie world focus ?</strong> - the crazy impact just three cards have  <span>Useless story you really don't need to read</span>  I didn't start with a zombie world version of the deck, instead starting with a very usual pure stun list and learning the ins and outs of the archetype (I am a returning player, quit a bit before links arrived, about six years ago and came back with master duel). While I mostly enjoyed the playstyle of the deck, I felt that it was missing something, a spark, a power play on top of the pure floodgate based stun (which is also a bit passive to my taste - do not read bad, just, I usually enjoy playing a bit more actively) and some protection.  As well as some combo feeling I usually enjoy having in my decks on a more personal level.  What really caught my eye with the eldlich cards isn't the great consistency, the mighty disruptive power meshed with the ability to play with so many strong floodgates, the oh so annoying resilience of the deck (though, oh my, what flavor, exactly what you should feel from a zombie deck) or even how well every card flows into the others (beautiful sight though, great design), but the fact that they have the ability to support all zombie archetypes. I heavily enjoy archetypes that can serve as generic support to a broad range of decks. I get my fun from building decks. I don't mind playing duels, just, I don't really care about it most of the time beyond seeing my ideas coming to life on the board, which is very fulfilling to me though.  After playing just a couple of duels, I was already crafting decks in my head, from the obvious shiranui/mayakashi and more out there ideas such as skull servants (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/wightmare-skull-servant-eldlich/"">right here</a>) or even just good old awesome zombie monster mash. Honestly, the ideas flowing in my head and trying to figure out how to make it all work made me excited about yugioh again.  At that time however, and with the limited ressources master duel allows you to have, I wanted to focus on eldlich cards themselves and wanted to give them a little bit of umpf. And - I know this isn't really inventive or anything - it struck me : this world, IT'S A ZOMBEH WORLD ! I had all these zombie decks ideas all of a sudden, and it just felt like the natural step to take.  <span>The zombie world trifecta and how it actually changes the deck</span>  I did a little research and found out about balerdroch and banshee, and well, that's just what the deck needed. Balerdroch and banshee add a lot, and I mean a lot of power to the deck.  <span>Necroworld banshee</span> alone makes it very, very, very (did I mention very ?) consistent to get zombie world out first turn (well, opponent's draw phase, which to be fair, is kind of the continuation of your first turn), which in turn makes rivalry of warlord that much stronger than it already is. That lock alone has won me a great deal of games. So much so that I will go out of my way to get zombie world out, no matter how minus I go (and, well, this is still eldlich we are talking about, you can never go that minus - just, can't go as plus as I could if I didn't force banshee that badly). I rarely set up multiple eldlich in board + grave, I usually only have the one actually, with two of them sitting patiently in the deck - waiting for the next game after I win the current one. I rarely ever have even just two golden lords in play (counting the grave). I do not try to slow roll it, or set up a potential otk, I go hard on zombie world most of my games, and always if I open rivalry. Again, the generic aspect of the eldlich cards is simply beautiful.  <span>Doomking balerdroch</span>. And there he is, the almighty doomking himself, in all of his glory, the one and only<span> balerdroch.</span> Oh my, such a beautiful oppressive beast. Your opponents will scratch their heads over how to deal with the terror. The recurring non targeting banish and negate it grants you just gives you the weapons you needed to reach the next level. It gives you disruption and protection. One of the first cards that come to mind is ariel. Oh my, such a terrifying card, and I mean it. With balerdroch however, you can easily deal with her and protect your eldlich in the grave. And just like his cousin eldlich, he just comes back and back and back, and that's if they can even touch your board in the first place with balerdroch guarding it.  <span>He also makes the mirror a joke</span>, which I like a lot. Makes it so much more comfortable. I have encountered eldlichs quite a couple times and have only lost the mirror once, where I went second and they just opened ice dragon's prison and solemn judgment, which both together shut me down (lost the 50/50 snipe as well) and I got otk'd on turn 3. Died to my own golden lord. Sad times.  As a bonus he can negate an ash at all times regardless of zombie world. Beautiful. If ash herself doesn't prevent his summon in the first place... Not beautiful.  <span>Zombie world</span> is really what ties it all together. Boosts rivalry of warlords to ridiculous levels. Lets balerdroch be the terror that he is supposed to be. And banshee just puts it on the field extra consistently. It also messes a lot with some decks, namely tri-brigade, which need specific types on the field/graveyard.  <span>Ending thoughts on the zombie world trio</span>  These three cards alone make the deck that much stronger in my opinion, especially in a no side deck best of 1 format - and by sheer virtue of simply existing. They prepare you to face any situation and remove bricks from the deck (more on that in the next section). Their presence alone elevates the deck and brings it a step further. If they are in the deck you easily tutor them with all the eldlich cards and if you draw them, well, great, you drew them and can use them, they don't sit dead in your hand like a coltwing would. They give you power, disruption, protection and resilience, at the cost of no consistency. If anything, it makes the deck more consistent.  <strong>Techs and choices</strong>  <span>Useless and obvious rant <span>(does pave the way for the rest and gives it more meaning...)</span></span>  There are two kinds of card I despise and try to avoid or minimize at all cost when building a deck : anything that's an inherent minus and potential bricks. Duh, I know.  Don't get me wrong, I loove the halqifibrax auroradon line of play. The sheer combo nature of the line and what you can build from just one card amazes me and makes me feel things inside. I've tried myself to go as far as I could with a one card opening hand, and went with that combo to end up with auroradon and dracossack (aka accesscode talker the following turn), double hot red dragon archfiend abyss, yup, double, true king of all calamities, as you do, and even an d.d. crow in hand for good measures. It was slightly (heavily - read ""I had a 16 cards deck which let me mostly control the mills"") set up and still took some tries, but man, was it beautiful. However, as grand as the combo is, I hate having to run coltwing. It makes the whole line much stronger, but if you draw it, it just sits dead in your hand and it kinda ruins your play, kills a lot of possibilities. At the same time, you don't want to put more, as it is more potential bricks, you do really want it in the deck however, and, and, and, well, it is just pain and I try to avoid this kind of card as much as possible or mitigate them as well as I can.  As for inherently minus card, unless they have specific synergy with your cards or happen to be unfortunately core to what you're trying to play, I don't even ever consider them. Seeing them in a list makes me unreasonably angry. When I see an exodia list with either mallet or reload I close the video or replay on the spot.  <span>Building for a single game format</span>  Especially in a single game format like we have on master duel, as much as possible, you want to cut bricks or minimize them, even more than usual, and really make your deck have an all around purpose instead of catering to niche situations/countering one specific strategy. Each game being 100% of its value, you cannot, in my humble opinion, afford niche techs (unless they adress your one weakness or something, but then again, is it even niche or a tech then ?). You also do not have the comfort of a side, making each card you actually put in your deck have that much more weight, both in what it brings to the deck but also in its drawbacks. It's all magnified tenfold. Each card's impact is greatly increased. It is actually very interesting how much building for a single game format steers away from catering to a Bo3 format, it has its own separate meta rankings both in playable decks overall and what cards are good or bad.  <span>Rivalry of warlords</span>  Anyways. One of the things I like a lot about banshee/zombie world, is that it actually minimizes that aspect of one of your best card, as well as trasncending it : rivalry of warlords. Which is what I meant by them making the deck less bricky and more consistent (as well as more powerful). It makes it an all purpose card, great against all decks besides the couple zombie decks you'll encounter, in which case, well, you have balerdroch... (the three card ""engine"" fixes its own weakness, uncanny.) and just locks most decks with next to no drawback anymore.  <span>Gozen match</span>  You'll actually notice I have dropped the usual gozen match from the deck. While I wouldn't mind it in a Bo3 format with side decking, for a single match format, well, for all the reasons stated above I have come to despise the card. How many games have I lost, before changing the deck for this current zombie world version, just from drawing two or more copies of gozen match and/or rivalry of warlords and them just not bothering the opponent whatsoever. Gozen match even more so (which is more so a current meta thing than it being inherently worst than rivalry - though it is after zombie world). I have thus come to cut it from the list (even before going with the zombie world trifecta) and my winrate did go a bit up from just that. And after the zombie world shift, winrate really soared (though it was always comfortably positive, you obviously do not need my changes nor my rant to get results from eldlich haha).  <span>Summon limit</span>  I have instead replaced it with an all purpose summon limit. Again, minimizing potential bricks. Summon limit has actually been great and I am really happy with it. I also love that it applies retroactively (acting as a one time negate sometimes, on top of the floodgate, say on a fusion or ritual spell activated after two monsters have already been summoned) and still counts monsters summoned to your side of the board (kaijus I'm looking at you...). Really screws up a lot of decks. While genuinely happy with it, it would however be the first card I cut to add more solemn judgment when/if I open more.  <span>Foolish burial goods</span>  I don't know why I haven't seen foolish burial goods in any of the eldlich lists I have checked, including tournaments topping lists. I'm genuinely surprised. It basically lets you tutor any of your traps and play with the ones you have already drawn without making them redundant, as it becomes any of the ones you didn't draw. It has made opening that much easier. I only run one for that same recurring idea, minimizing bricks, as you can only activate one a turn, and also, once you start cycling, you don't need to launch the engine anymore, the momentum of the eldlich cards is too great. It also baits ash blossom very nicely. All around a choice I have never once come to regret.  <span>Necroface</span>  Now a more out there tech : necroface. While foolish burial goods just makes too much sense to me, necroface is admittedly a bit iffy. I didn't start with necroface at all. More so with the pure stun list, I have had my fair share of games going the long run, and nearly, or some times even actually, running me out of ressource. Some of the games I've had that come to mind were against virtual world or prank-kids, that just kept on coming and coming and getting to the board, no matter how many times I dealt with it. Necroface was the best solution I've found. I have looked into a couple other choices such as magna dragon zirnitron or gizmek makami, however none have the impact necroface can have on a game. While it has sit in my hand standing idly by and taking up a draw for no result some amount of time, when it did, I've usually felt at ease nontheless. A necroface going through really, and I mean really rejuvenates the deck, letting you steamroll the traps some more, and essentially doubling your stamina, letting you for a whole second game... in the very same one. Also recycles golden lord if all three get banished as a bonus or your banished extra deck cards which sometimes comes into play, usually to go for a zeus. It is there primarily to shuffle your spells and traps back however, in order to give you that sometimes needed second wind (which is a proactive play that can always occur and thus not making necroface a straight brick whereas having your golden lord banished, all three at that, is not something you should hardly cater to as it does not commonly happen - don't plan for fringe scenarios if it costs too much consistency or doesn't add anything besides adressing that one scenario). As such, drawing into it isn't such a big deal, even only one or two turns into the game, as you'll already get value from it, and getting that one or two extra conquistadors can really change the face of some games. It also has the potential to screw with some decks, namely virtual world and also the eater of millions/gizmek orochi/gren maju da eiza deck that is actually decently popular and some others. Even besides those decks, on multiple occasions, has my opponent just surrendered on a necroface summon. They jusy couldn't run me out of ressources anymore. I may edit with some of the replays I have to showcase necroface's potential impact if I ever record them. All in all, a bit out there and nothing crucial, also, sadly, no way to tutor for it, but I have been happy with it, and have actually literally won games on its back, where I would have lost otherwise, against those aforementionned decks and a couple times off the extra conquistador(s). 10/10 would recommend.  <strong>Footnotes</strong>  <span>The deck is not fully optimized I am working with the cards I actually have</span>  A couple of footnotes. The extra deck is comprised of what I actually own on master duel.  I also have only the one <span>solemn judgment</span>, I'd add a second one, if not even a third one - cards to cut first should probably be summon limits (one or two), maybe one huaquero (I am a partisan of the triple huaquero however), maybe even an eldlich the golden lord honestly or even one extravagance - mayybe necroface but it really gets closer to any other eldlich list at this point. Try the creepy doll, I promise you won't regret it.  <span>Glow-up bloom</span> adds consistency as well, not needed, but definitely improves the deck. I would definitely run it if I had it, especially with an avendread savior. I don't recommend crafting it however, unless you are bathing in crafting points. Where I would probably cut the third eldlich the golden lord in order to add more solemn judgments, I probably wouldn't if you have glow-up bulb.  If you have <span>pleiades</span>, please add it to the deck instead of tiras and adreus. Also, add <span>avendread savior</span> if you own any copy. It can replace any of the links really (or those same rank 5s), the least important ones being cerberus and even borrelsword honestly. To be fair though, the extra deck really doesn't matter much, I seldom use it. Which is actually part of the reason why you run extravagance over prosperity in the deck.  <span>Extravagance vs prosperity</span>  When your extra deck matters and your plays revolve around a couple key cards in said extra deck, extravagance is obviously never a consideration. However, when a deck does not rely on the extra deck, that is where the discussion becomes interesting. Here is my take on it.  The way to look at it is very simple really : extragavance generates card advantage where prosperity adds (a lot of) consistency. If you really need to dig for that one card to unlock your plays, prosperity is the choice. If your deck is greatly consistent, extravagance will give you more of an edge. That's really all it is, card advantage vs consistency.  In a vacuum I usually like prosperity way better than extravagance. It essentially gives you a scry mulligan, which is just insane to think about even if it is only for one card. However, eldlich is so greatly consistent already that it makes much better use of the card advantage extravagance provides, and really doesn't need the consistency boost you gain with prosperity.  <span>Do NOT prioritize building the extra deck if you are low on ressources</span>  When I even use the extra deck in the first place, what really matters usually is mostly being able to send conquistador and huaquero to the grave proactively to trigger them during the end phase, be it with linking them away or detaching them for an xyz effect. As such, any generic rank 5 or link 1/2 are fine. If you can actually get a good effect on top, sure, of course, but it is not <em>needed.</em>  Small note however, as I went over it earlier, the deck really consistently gets zombie world on the field, as such vampire bram and avendread savior are pretty ""key"" in that regard as they bypass the rivalry lock, being zombie monsters. Of course, if you have a golden lord in the grave, the issue is non existent in the first place.  <span>Thank you for checking my list !</span>  And that's pretty much it. If you have had the strength (the madness ?) to read it all, well, I thank you and hopefully it was even slightly insightful. If you have any questions (or remark/advice), leave them as a comment or even just dm me, I'll try to answer ! Cheers and get your game on"

Going second just break the board with droplets and power spells, and then try to go for game.  The duels shouldn't go past turn 3 but the deck can grind but against a meta deck you will lose if you do not play optimally.  Droll in the main i think is a good card to throw your opponent off guard, no one plays around droll game 1 , also if you open droll , try to prioritize summoning dark law. Most decks lose to dark law + droll, and if you can set up a plasma or DPE as well, it is a hard time for the opponent. Also it can be swapped with ashe if you don't want to main droll, and move droll to the side.  I cut down on playing the extra destiny heros bc FD is at 2 and there is no point to open more bricks, since this deck already plays so many.  THINGS TO THINK ABOUT( if anyone trys these things please let me know)  thinking about trying 9 hand traps in the flex spot just to see, since hand traps are getting stronger now.  adding verte to the xtra deck , i just dont own it  trying different masked heros  cross sheep?  d hero dusktopia ? protected dark law?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

What if you could draw 10 cards in one turn and banish all the cards in your opponent's deck instead? Let's look at the n,"<span>The new <em>Mysterune</em> deck has some interesting strategies. Where attacking your opponent to reduce their life points to 0 is made out of the question by almost all of the cards in the new and upcoming archetype, the interesting field spell that allows you to draw 3 multiple times in one turn (and not just on your turn) still seems more than alluring. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck focuses around banishing the top card(s) of your opponent's deck by activating a series of quick-play spell cards with considerably powerful effects including searching any <em>Mysterune</em> card; negating an opponent's monster's effects; discarding a random card from the opponent's hand when they add a card from their deck to their hand, and destroying a monster or spell/trap. Additionally, these effects all include an effect to banish a number of cards (ranging from 1-4) from the top of the opponent's deck. Each of these quick-play spell cards also has the option to instead summon a <em>Mysterune</em> monster from the extra deck to the extra monster zone. More on this later.</span>  <span>To facilitate the continued activation of these quick-play spell cards, their field spell, <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em>, allows you to activate <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell cards <strong>from your hand during your opponent's turn</strong>. Furthermore, the field spell has a soft once-per-turn effect if you activate a <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell card that targets 3 <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell cards, puts them on the bottom of the deck, then <strong>lets you draw 3 cards</strong>. This is most useful during your opponent's turn as you can draw more quick-play spell cards to use in that same turn and disrupt your opponent even further. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>As for the monsters you can summon, <i><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></i> allows you to add any non-quick-play <em>Mysterune</em> spell card from your GY to your hand, which can <strong>enable multiple activations of the draw effect</strong> of <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> in one turn. <a data-name=""&lt;em&gt;Muninn, Wings of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mysterune&lt;/em&gt;""><em>Muninn, Wings of the</em> <em>Mysterune</em></a>, the other monster you can summon, allows you to search any <em>Mysterune</em> continuous spell card from your deck to your hand by discarding one card – however, there is only one card that meets these conditions. <em><a data-name=""Deceit of the Mysterune"">Deceit of the Mysterune</a></em>, the card in question, will <strong>banish a card from the top of an opponent's deck each time any quick-play spell card is activated</strong>, even if it doesn't resolve (but not if the activation is negated). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Other engines to facilitate the strategy are the <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> engine, which can provide turn-after-turn advantage off of used spell cards such as <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> after using its draw effect or duplicate copies of quick-play spell cards to send back to the deck for more draws. <a data-name=""&lt;em&gt;Magicians' Souls&lt;/em&gt;""><em>Magicians' Souls</em></a> can also be used to summon <em><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></em> for battle protection or <em><a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a></em> for monster removal (including your own <em><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></em> to clear the extra monster zone for a <em>Mysterune</em> monster) via equipping as a spell that can then be used with another copy of <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> to draw more cards. Lastly, since both <em><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></em> and <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em> are DARK monsters, they can be used to summon <em><a data-name=""Beat Cop from the Underworld"">Beat Cop from the Underworld</a></em>, which can then tribute itself to <strong>clear the extra monster zone</strong> for another <em>Mysterune</em> monster – with the <strong>added bonus of protecting another card on the field</strong>. </span>  <span>To utilise your normal summon, <em><a data-name=""Royal Magical Library"">Royal Magical Library</a></em> and <em><a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></em> also bolster the strategy by <strong>providing card advantage and consistency respectively</strong> all while enabling the summon of rank 4 XYZ monsters such as <em><a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a></em> with <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em> to clear the extra monster zone for more summons, recycle used <em>Mysterune</em> monsters, and provide card advantage. <em><a data-name=""Soul Absorption"">Soul Absorption</a></em> might seem like a gimmicky, 'win more' card, however, in this strategy you rely on drawing cards you can use immediately or during your opponent's turn, which doesn't always happen. If you have a single copy of <em><a data-name=""Soul Absorption"">Soul Absorption</a></em> on your side of the field, you can <strong>gain over 10,000 LP in a single turn</strong>, ensuring that if you run out of 'juice' you know that you are <strong>very unlikely to run out of LP for at least a couple of turns</strong>. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Other tech options include:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Instant fusion"">Instant fusion</a></strong> – This allows you to summon any of your <em>Mysteune</em> monsters to a normal monster zone virtually for free. If you summon <em><a data-name=""Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune"">Geri, Fangs of the Mysterune</a></em>, the monster will not be destroyed in the end phase due to its on-field effect.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Upstart&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Goblin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Upstart</strong> <strong>Goblin</strong></a><strong> </strong>– In this deck, consistency is everything. Besides, you don't care about your opponent's LP.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a> </strong>– This kind of ticks 3 boxes in one go: You have more consistency, you are guaranteed another turn (everything in this deck), and your opponent is one card closer to decking out. If you're lucky, you can use this card to trigger <em><a data-name=""Mysterune of Dispel"">Mysterune of Dispel</a></em> and discard a random card from your opponent's hand.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> </strong>– As mentioned before, sometimes you run out of 'juice' and don't have any more cards you could play. This card can come in handy when you're in a tight spot and of course, it furthers your journey to decking out your opponent.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>This strategy does suffer from consistency issues of course. <strong>Even if you are playing 10 copies</strong> of <em><a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a></em> (3x the field spell, 3x <em><a data-name=""Point of the Mysterune"">Point of the Mysterune</a></em>, 3x <em><a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></em>, and 1x <em><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a></em>), you will not always have access to it, in which case you very quickly run out of things you can do and become a sitting duck. The fact that all of the quick-play spell cards in the strategy are hard once-per-turn effects regardless of which effect you choose (their monster summoning effect or their deck banishing effect) means that drawing multiple copies of some cards (or of cards you have already used that turn) <strong>could result in dead cards</strong>, giving your opponent the opportunity to shut down your strategy. </span>  <span>Once you get your engine going, however, not much can really stop you. You can go a few turns and then run out of things to do, but when you pass to your opponent, <strong>they can have two-thirds of their deck banished</strong> that often include crucial cards for their strategy, preventing them from breaking your 'board'. Sometimes I forget to check how many cards are left in my opponent's deck and I realise that I've <strong>accidentally won while trying to set up for the next turn</strong>. You will consistently draw into whatever other tech cards &amp; engines you add to this strategy since the <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spells cards are always sent to the bottom of the deck; I feel that there are a few ways to take advantage of this – I even tried splashing the <em>Invoked</em> engine in with this deck but I am not good at that strategy so I couldn't make it work.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I hope that Konami releases more support for this new archetype in the future as it has huge potential – maybe a <em>Mysterune</em> quick-play spell version of <em><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a></em>. I also hope that you enjoy testing out this deck and experimenting with different styles of play. </span>  &nbsp;  This post was made on 25/02/2022, some TCG card names may be outdated."

If you are new to the Dragonmaid deck here are some tips for each card: <ul>  	<li>All low level Dragonmaid monsters summon at the start of the Battle Phase their ""counterparts"" from the hand or graveyard, returning that card to the hand (level 3 monsters summon level 8 monsters, level 2 monsters summon level 7 monsters; Chamber Dragonmaid can summon any high level Dragonmaid, including fusion monsters). You can use their effects during your opponent's turn if that turn you returned them to your hand to summon high-level Dragonmaid, summoning them from your hand by the effect of the previously summoned cards.</li> </ul> <strong>Kitchen Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, you can add the card you need to your hand and then discard a high level Dragonmaid monster which you can summon during the Battle Phase and return to your hand at the end of the same phase to pay the cost again next turn.  <strong>Parlor Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, you can either: send a - high level Dragonmaid monster which you can summon during the Battle Phase and return to your hand at the end of the same phase. - low level Dragonmaid monster and then summon it by the effect of Nurse Dragonmaid / Dragonmaid Hospitality.  <strong>Nurse Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, revive a low level Dragonmaid monster from the graveyard, you can activate the effect of the revived monster.  <strong>Laundry Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, send the top three cards of your deck to the graveyard, it's not very advisable if you don't consider that you have good luck, you may end up sending key cards to the graveyard, if you send Dragonmaid cards you can recover them to your hand with the help of the Dragonmaid Welcome effect.  <strong>Chamber Dragonmaid: </strong>When summoned, add a Spell/Trap Dragonmaid to your hand from the deck. <ul>  	<li>All high level Dragonmaid monsters have activatable effects from the hand, which you can use without fear since you can recover the card by summoning it with the effects of the low level monsters, and then at the end of the Battle Phase, you can return it to hand or perform an XYZ summon during your Main Phase 2.</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Lorpar: </strong>Negate the effect of a monster in the opponent's field this turn, it is not a quick effect so you must use it during your Main Phase.  <strong>Dragonmaid Tinkhec: </strong>Increases by 2000 the attack of a Dragonmaid monster, it's a quick effect so you can use it if necessary during the Battle Phase; but you can use it during your Main Phase on a card that you are not going to return to the hand (a fusion Dragonmaid monster) and then summon it from the graveyard for the effect of a low level Dragonmaid monster.  <strong>Dragonmaid Ernus: </strong>Special summon a Dragonmaid monster of level 4 or lower from the graveyard which will activate its effect and then summon this card at the beginning of the Battle Phase, as it's a quick effect you can use it during your opponent's turn.  <strong>Dragonmaid Nudyarl: </strong>returns a monster in any graveyard to the deck, it can cause disruption in the opponent's strategy by returning key cards that he/she can use or recover, it's not a quick effect sadly. <ul>  	<li>Fusion Monsters</li> </ul> <strong>House Dragonmaid: </strong>Its first effect allows you to summon during any Standby Phase from your hand or Graveyard a Dragonmaid monster one level lower/higher than another you control, you must target another Dragonmaid monster to activate this effect, so if you only control this card you won't be able to use it; its second effect destroys an opponent's monster every time a dragon returns to the hand, making this a key card to clear the opponent's field.  <strong>Dragonmaid Sheou: </strong>Its first effect is an upgraded version of House Dragonmaid's effect, it summons a Level 9 or lower Dragonmaid monster from the hand or Graveyard without any requirements; Its second effect negates any activated opponent's effects, destroys the activated card, then returns this card to the Extra Deck and Summons House Dragonmaid from the Extra Deck. <ul>  	<li>Spell Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Welcome: </strong>Slightly increases the atk of your monsters depending on the amount of Dragonmaid you control, the important thing is its second effect, which allows you to recover Dragonmaid cards from the graveyard but you must control two Dragonmaid monsters to use this effect.  <strong>Dragonmaid Changeover: </strong>To summon by fusion, you can retrieve it from the graveyard by returning a Dragonmaid monster you control to your hand.  <strong>Dragonmaid Hospitality: </strong>Usually used to summon a low level monster and send its high level counterpart to the graveyard, so you can summon it in the Battle Phase.  <strong>Dragonmaid Send-Off:  </strong>To activate effects in the opponent's turn, it can also save you a turn if you do not have a good hand, since the summoned card is not destroyed by battle or effects until the end of the next turn. <ul>  	<li>Trap Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Dragonmaid Downtime: </strong>Return an opponent's backrow card at the end of his turn so that he/she cannot activate it on your turn, use it on your turn to add any Dragonmaid card you may need.  <strong>Dragonmaid Tidying: </strong>Disrupt your opponent's field/graveyard, then you can use its effect from the graveyard to summon a low level monster, trigger its effect, summon a high level monster at the beginning of the Battle Phase and summon it again from the hand if necessary, that way you don't have to return the summoned monster to the hand; you can only use one effect per turn. <ul>  	<li>Other Cards</li> </ul> <strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver:</strong> Use it as a Continuous Spell Card to Fusion Summon once per turn. <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: </strong>Hand trap.</p> <strong>Maxx ""C"": </strong>Free draw every time the opponent special summons.  <strong>Return of the Dragon Lords:</strong> Revive a level 7 or 8 dragon from the graveyard, protect a dragon monster from destruction by banishing it.  <strong>Guardragon Cataclysm: </strong>Destruction of the opponent's field.  <strong>Number 29: Mannequin Cat: </strong>Special Summon a monster from your hand, Graveyard, or Deck with the same Type or Attribute as one Special Summoned by your opponent, it's a great XYZ card for multi-Attribute Decks. <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle:</strong> Gains the attributes of all monsters it has as XYZ material and is not destroyed by battle or by effect of a monster with the same attribute as this card, once per turn you can select an opponent's monster in the Graveyard and set it to this card as a XYZ material, which makes it great for opponent's graveyard disruption.</p> <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Número 97 Draglubión: </strong>The reason why the deck has monsters XYZ Dragon Numbers.</p> <p class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder &amp;

Less of a build guide but more of a deck profile addressing staple choices and my thought processes whe,"<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, and I'm back with my favorite deck, fresh from just reaching P1 because I've sped run the ladder today because I've got nothing else better to do. As the title suggests, presenting Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls, again. As per usual, the side deck are cards that I have either ""sided out"" (aka interchangeable cards per game solely depending on the feel of my draws and nothing else because there's no way to accurately predict which deck you're gonna be up against in a BO1 format) throughout my run in the ladder and I'll explain my ""siding patterns"" (kinda) because MD format sucks for not having a BO3 but I digress.</span>  <strong><span>The list:</span></strong>  <span>So first of all, I think I want to go with addressing the ""side deck"" alongside the main.</span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong> - <span>This slot shares with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, one being a great board wipe and the other, a great hand trap. I haven't really encountered any trap heavy decks as of late, or even Eldlich in particular, so I decided to use <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> for the mean time. Seems like everyone got bored of playing that deck finally, thank God.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>These cards' slots share with <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, a more defensive tool in contrast to the more aggressive combination of the two. The thing with Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls is that, you can play the deck however you want, be it going 1st or going 2nd, but you'd have to adjust both your side and extra deck for it. For going 1st builds, I'd personally pick <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> but <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is also a good follow up card. It's just that I've noticed that the higher I climb the ladder, the more ubiquitous back row removal cards become. People aren't even using their <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> against monsters even if they're in face-up Attack Position, also I've had a couple of mirrors with this deck and Crossout can mess up your opponent on such scenarios.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></strong> - <span>This card, I'm a bit scared to use it honestly, because of mainly the previously stated presence of heavy back row removal and it's best going first, which is unlikely to be guaranteed for you because everyone's mostly gonna go first if they had the chance to choose, but it's strong nonetheless especially against mono-type strategies that like to swarm, like Phantom Knights, Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade, or Drytrons even.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a></strong> - <span>Yes, I know I said I'm never gonna be using <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> because of how much I hate this card but I pulled one, okay? Might as well craft two more... but anyway. These three are a bit weird. Often there are times where <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> just feels like a brick, because it's an EARTH Attributed monster, same thing goes to Ash and Droll. Ash is generally useful, but that also means it's targeted by pretty much everyone, no doubt. Droll sometimes takes people by surprise, but is pretty useless against decks that play in the graveyard anyway. 2/2/2 ratio of each seems fine, but I'd probably only do that when I'm going first and I have Crossout.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a></strong> - <span>This slot is the most contentious one of all because this slot is a flex spot for your generic <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target. I've had more trouble deciding which card to place here than interchanging hand traps and staples in the main. This also used to be <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, but when I changed it, there aren't any Prank-Kids or Thunder Dragon players anywhere to be seen. <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> also took this slot before but I've seen less Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades after I mained it. Even <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> used to be here, but then I can't make use of her outside Adamancipator, Traptrix, or EARTH Machines match ups. So this one's really up to you. Other options include <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke"">World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke</a>, <a data-name=""Diplexer Chimera"">Diplexer Chimera</a>, and <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a>, all of which are great more specifically against Code Talkers.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Absolutely mandatory. I'd rather have a 16th Extra Deck slot than give up this one, especially because this is the Extra Deck killer variant which plays <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. I also am not playing the <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> + <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a> package and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> because it takes way too much space for an Extra Deck that is already tight enough and costs 1 extra Special Summon as opposed to just using <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a>, which can also be made by Normal Summoning either <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> or any of your Level 4 or lower DARK Attributed Shaddoll monsters since they're all Spellcasters.</span></span>  <span>• <span>I actually am debating on cutting down <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> for <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> (as soon as I'm able to craft or pull a copy) or even a second copy of <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> for insurance. I also am not playing <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> because Fusion decks already costs a lot of resources to make plays, although it's playable, so long as you know what to do about it properly. I also have cut down <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, because those two are much better on just Invoked Shaddolls list, where you could play more Shaddoll cards.</span></span>  <span>What I have also noticed when climbing the ladder that might be helpful for you, if you're still reading this, is that people tend to be more complacent and slack off when the season's about to end even back then in S1 but especially now that Platinum 1 players can't get demoted anymore, so if you want to catch the ""easier"" wins, try grinding a week or two before the season ends like I did, because people will always instantly try hard with their meta decks either as soon as the new season starts or during the last week of the season where everyone suddenly tries to catch up for the rankings. This pattern has always been present throughout all games that have seasonal rankings, so yeah. Just something for you to keep in mind to consider. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can, especially regarding the current text font because I chose this one in particular because it's not as straining to the eyes, unlike the others so, yeah.</span>"

Use them to go into joyus melffy to begin the loop of popping 3 cards. Melffy of The Forest can be used to search out Melffy Hide and Seek, and Melffy Time so you can set up for a huge impact for game. Hide and Seek is crucial to have on the field as it protects your beast monsters from getting wiped by things like raigeki or other effects once per turn; as well as allowing you to recycle beast monsters by returning 3 different ones from the grave to the deck. This includes rescue cat. There are 2 main win conditions to this deck. Constant control of the opponent's field by repeatedly bouncing joyus melffy to special summon 3 kalantosas and popping up to 3 cards on the field while you whittle them down; or controlling the field while stacking Melffy Mommy's material count, activating Melffy Time, detaching everything, and swinging for game."

Ultimate Master: World Championship Tournament 2006, fiz um pequeno ajuste, sou fã de monstros aquáticos, a principal estratégia que eu faço é colocar a carta 'A Legendary Ocean' como carta para alterar o campo de batalha para dar vantagem aos meus monstros tanto no ataque como na defesa, e uso o 'Tornado Wall' para não levar dano nos meus pontos de vida, como o ' A Legendary Ocean' reduz 1 nivel dos monstros aquáticos posso colocar meu 'Giga Gagagigo' sem precisar sacrificar monstros, esse deck tem monstros com ótima defesa, outra estratégia também, é destruir cartas mágicas e armadilhas do meu adversário assim anulando suas estratégias também, esse deck é simples mas tenho um grande carinho por ele.  Espero ter gostado dele."

It follows the same characteristics of other anime Cyberse decks like Code Talker, Salamangreat and @Ignister of being able to make a decent <strong>game volume</strong> to establish an end board and have very satisfactory <strong>recursion in the grind game</strong>. Like Salamangreat, <strong>deck interactions are based on activating Traps</strong>, but so far Archetype has no way to add them to the hand on turn 1 (there is an OCG support that solves this problem but it will take a long time to get to the TCG and a lot even longer to get to the Master Duel). One thing I want to say about the Archetype card design is that in Anime the same character that played as Marincess was the one who played as <strong>Trickstar</strong> so several of the Archetype cards have burn effects, especially Traps have this feature that 90% of Traps are unusable in the deck because they are not actually interaction. The deck's gameplay is based just like @Ignister on making <strong>Towers unaffected by card effects</strong>. For this you need to have the <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> field activated and have made your Archetype LINK-3 or LINK-4 in the Extra Monster Zone using <a data-name=""Crystal Heart"">Crystal Heart</a> as material. What is most impressive about archetype is the <strong>card economy</strong> while setting up your field, for example if you made 1 combo card among your 11 ways to achieve this you will in the end have your Boss Monster with high ATK thanks to the FIeld Spell plus a Follow Up in hand guaranteed. That said below I will show you all the possible combos to do with the deck and discuss archetype cards and generic Cyberse support and Water generic support possible to use in the deck.

its effect)  /////////////////////////////////////////Explanation of some Archetype cards and generic support. <strong>Marincess Cards</strong>  <a data-name=""Marincess Pascalus"">Marincess Pascalus</a> for being level 4 helps to make <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>. And its effect on the GY of adding the Spells/Traps back to the hand is very good for recycling the <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> which is the best interaction the deck has at its disposal. The problem with Pascalus is that it doesn't converse very well with the Extender Water you might be using on the deck and many builds even cut it out of the Main Deck. <a data-name=""Marincess Sea Horse"">Marincess Sea Horse</a> is the best card in the deck because it is Starter and Extender and makes 1 Card Combo LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a>. The other main deck cards only fit as a Starter or Extender. <a data-name=""Marincess Blue Tang"">Marincess Blue Tang</a> can be said to be the best card in the Archetype also because even though it is not an Extender it makes the deck spin and you access the Extenders to continue playing being the best consistency card in the deck.  <a data-name=""Marincess Mandarine"">Marincess Mandarine</a> is easily Recycle from Banished Zone with LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> so you just need 1 copy. <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> can force an opponent's negate if their main monster has an ATK that can be overcome by equipping GY's Marincess to your <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> for example. A great interaction bait to get your play through. <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> isn't hard once per turn, so it's definitely an improved <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and the best interaction the deck has available. In addition to being able to be activated directly from the hand, it <strong>protects all monsters you control</strong> with the best possible effect: ""Unaffected by Opponent's Card Effects"" for the rest of the turn.  LINK-1 <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> is the best way to make <a data-name=""Marincess Mandarin"">Marincess Mandarin</a> come alive and being able to enter the field as extend by the Link arrow is excellent. LINK-2 <a data-name=""Crystal Heart"">Crystal Heart</a> in the Extra Monster Zone helps you to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> a bit during your combos as it is Unnafected by MONSTER Effects, always remember this detail when using Crystal Heart as material from <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> or Boss Monster <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> he also gains protection. Monsters made in Extra Monster Zone using Crystal Heart as material are only ""Unaffected by Opponent's CARD Effects"" while you control Field Spell <a data-name=""Battle Ocean"">Battle Ocean</a> so if you take <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> for example you lose your Boss Monster along with the rest of your field. If your unsuspecting opponent destroys the <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> in the Spell&amp;Trap Zone and you have the <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> in the GY you can add it back to your hand to have one more interaction with the opponent this turn. LINK-4 <a data-name=""Wonder Heart"">Wonder Heart</a> eff in Battle Phase its not Hard Once Per Turn, so you can always protect from destruction in Battle Phase while you have an Equip Marincess Monster. Don't forget its excellent Floating effect of Special Summoning a Marincess LINK-3 or less. LINK-4 <a data-name=""Bubble Reef"">Bubble Reef</a> has a <strong>mandatory effect of gaining 600ATK for each banished monster</strong> until end of turn, so against decks like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade"">Tri-Brigade</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked"">Invoked</a> that need to banish monsters to play it becomes a Boss Monster Unaffected by Card Effects with absurd ATK being practically impossible to take it out of the field in the Battle Phase ensuring it survives for the next turn. If you use a reduced Marincess engine in the Extra Deck like for example 2 <a data-name=""Blue Slug"">Blue Slug</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> you can do some of the different combos in the details than equipping the Field Spell back on the field because for example if you make the End Board of <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a> you have <strong>two Deck Resource Recovery</strong>, 1 with <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a> itself and another with <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> so you can choose to equip only two Link monsters in Marbled Rock and leave one in the gy like <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> for example and return it to the Extra Deck with the Anemone eff and leave it to add a Marincess to Hand with the Marbled Rock to have an excellent grind game with the <strong>correct Resource Management</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Generic Cyberse Support</strong>  <a data-name=""Armored Bitron"">Armored Bitron</a> is a generic support of Cyberse that works in this deck like a <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>, and locks you into Cyberse for the rest of the turn. With him you always bring the <a data-name=""Sea Horse"">Sea Horse</a> from the Deck and with that you make 1 Card Combo normally. Plus it has an interesting GY effect on the deck that you shouldn't forget about. <a data-name=""Shootingcode Talker"">Shootingcode Talker</a> is a great Generic Cyberse Monster option for Marincess' deck because it gives a 2 draw potential which is all the deck wants because keeping cards advantage over the opponent makes the gamestate controlled by the amount of tech cards that fits in the deck and the ability to recycle resources every turn making it one of the best grind games among Cyberse decks.  Remember that <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> locks you into Special Summoning Cyberse Monsters. If you use <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> eff Reborn <a data-name=""Crytal Heart"">Crytal Heart</a> you can make <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>(in the Extra Monster Zone) Unaffected by Opponent Card Effects.  <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> is the best generic extra deck package out there for Cyberse decks. It's very hard to see a Cyberse deck that doesn't use them. In this deck you should be careful with the <strong>restrictions of some engine cards</strong> that don't allow you to use these two monsters but overall it's an excellent addition to the deck, but you don't necessarily need them to play Marincess. Another generic support of Cyberse that can be used in this deck is <a data-name=""Tri-gate Wyzard"">Tri-gate Wyzard</a> instead of Transcode Talker and its main effect for this deck is not the negation eff, but the effect of inflicting <strong>Double Battle Damage and the effect of banishing a card</strong> that the opponent controls .  In general, the Cyberse Archetypes Extra Deck is very restricted and has little room to make changes, this Extra Deck from the decklist below can be assembled a little differently from the one presented, leaving at your discretion the changes you want to make such as placing the Transcode Talker and Accesscode Talker.  /////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Budget Options</strong> Paleozoic Traps: <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a>, <a data-name=""Canadia"">Canadia</a>, <a data-name=""Olenoides"">Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Marrella"">Marrella</a> to send the Marincess Wave to the GY.  <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a> is one of the best trap cards in the game = can handle with monsters and floodgates and also have sinergy with Wave to return to field from GY as an extender.  If you use a high amount of Paleozoic Traps it is also very good to use <a data-name=""Paleozoic Opabinia"">Paleozoic Opabinia</a>. The deck doesn't have a lot of removal cards so traps like <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation"">Compulsory Evacuation</a> are very good options to overcome this deficiency. Other interesting cards: <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> or <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, <a data-name=""Mistar Boy"">Mistar Boy</a>, <a data-name=""Aria the &lt;a data-name=&quot;Water Charmer&quot;&gt;Water Charmer&lt;/a&gt;"">Aria the </a><a data-name=""Water Charmer"">Water Charmer</a> which is interesting because it can use monsters that are not Water or Cyberse as material, for example <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>.  ///////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck, they are just card options that can be used in the deck</strong> or that I'm not specifically using in my Marincess extra deck in Master Duel but that are very common and I can even say what standards to be used in Marincess decklists . Just understand that this profile deck is more to explain theory than the standard way to play Marincess, so various changes can be made to your liking.  <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is as well as the <a data-name=""Trancode Talker"">Trancode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> package indispensable for Water and Cyberse monster decks and needs no introduction. But if I'm talking so well about the Code Talker package and the Bahamut Shark package then why don't I use it in the deck? Simply because this is the purest possible version of Marincess, but for sure most decklists use at least half of the generic extra deck cards mentioned above.  Frog Engine: <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> + <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> - helps play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. And there's a good combo involving <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and <a data-name=""Blue Tang"">Blue Tang</a>. <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> is not hard once per turn so whenever you give him Reborn he activates the effect as in the case of using the <a data-name=""Coral Anemone"">Coral Anemone</a> eff. Frog's engine was used a lot in the launch of the deck where few useful cards existed and you needed something that generated pressure on the field. Over time, excellent supports came along to make the deck what it is today, and there are even more supports that were released in the OCG last year to improve Marincess' Archetype a bit more. That said, what happened was that with the arrival of new supports, the use of the Frog Engine became unnecessary and playing in the purest possible version is what gives Marincess more results. <a data-name=""Silent Sea Nettle"">Silent Sea Nettle</a> is the best Extender Water option to use on deck. <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a> is another good tech card option in the deck. <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> to send specially the effs of <a data-name=""Pascalus"">Pascalus</a> and <a data-name=""Sea Angel"">Sea Angel</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> makes <a data-name=""Mandarin"">Mandarin</a> 1 Combo card, so it's a good card to try out in your deck.  Like any deck that makes use of equipment during its playthroughs, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> becomes a very good card to use in that deck because its activation cost is almost free when sending Equip Monsters to the GY.  ///////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Final deck details:</strong>  Floodgate monsters that stop Marincess' turn completely: <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. Of course <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> stop every archetype in the game but several decks manage to have at least 1 out for the card within the engine itself and Marincess doesn't have that out at all. <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> as well as any <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a>-type effects are enough for you not to be able to play Marincess either. That's why it's quite common to use anti-Combo Decks cards in Marincess like <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> to deal with these cards. Blind Second cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> hurt you a lot by losing a lot of engine cards in the process despite keeping the Boss Monster and having Follow Ups in hand. That's why I don't think it's wrong to use 3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> from Main Deck. The deck lacks reliance against Hand Traps especially against <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> and also suffers a lot if the Normal Summon is disrupted or taken out of the field or flipped face-down.  Interaction between <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> + <a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a> + <a data-name=""Marbled Rock"">Marbled Rock</a>: after activating Wave all your monsters become unaffected by card effects so the only way for your opponent to take Bahamut Shark out of the field is through the Battle Phase but <strong>Marbled Rock protects him from harm</strong> destroyed by battle and that way you guarantee you can activate Bahamut Shark on your next turn and bring another <a data-name=""Toadally Awsome"">Toadally Awsome</a> onto the field.  <a data-name=""Great Bubble Reef"">Great Bubble Reef</a> is an excellent card, don't underestimate the power of having a version of <a data-name=""Code Talker Heatsoul"">Code Talker Heatsoul</a> in the deck's own engine. Decks that don't draw bother me because seeing new cards is always the difference between having chances in the game or not. That's why cards like <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> are absurd to the point of being limited.  I think the Tecnoplay you should be looking to improve the most when playing Marincess is <a data-name=""game 3 of the deck on how to play as efficiently as possible"">game 3 of the deck on how to play as efficiently as possible</a> because this is a Salamangreat-style Cyberse deck that <strong>beats the opponent in fatigue with you remaking your entire field with low resources every turn</strong> keeping pressure on the opponent throughout the duel.  &nbsp;"

My locals isn't hyper competitive and I'm not expecting the Brave Engine to be represented in any meaningful capacity so I'm choosing to side deck the Ogres and main deck the Nibirus.  DPE isn't as consistent as he was when FD was at 3, but he's still a good option for most match ups and I'm choosing not to run Verte due to how tight the Extra Deck is, and how devastating it is to have him get negated and have no follow up.  I'm also choosing to use the Charmer Climb instead of the Halq Climb due to it being the more resilient to interruption and out of fear that Halq is finally on the verge of being banned. Hiita also allows the teching of Underworld Goddess, who can win games that Accesscode might not be able to."

Concerning the combo for ""<a data-name=""Shooting Quasar Dragon"">Shooting Quasar Dragon</a>,"" the minimum amount of on-field monsters required to summon it is ""<a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>,"" ""<a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>,"" and one level 1 non-tuner monster (usually this is ""<a data-name=""Aromage Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a>"" due to its ease of being brought onto the field thanks to being able to be Special Summoned from the hand when you have the LP lead, but this can also be ""<a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a>"" in a pinch.) With ""<a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>,"" you use its primary effect to Special Summon ""<a data-name=""Steam Synchron"">Steam Synchron</a>"" from either your hand or deck, and then Synchro Summon ""<a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Steam Synchron"">Steam Synchron</a>"" and the level 1 non-tuner.

Then, as soon as possible, use the second effect of ""<a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>"" to Synchro Summon ""<a data-name=""Shooting Quasar Dragon"">Shooting Quasar Dragon</a>"" using ""<a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>,"" ""<a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a>,"" and ""<a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>."""

There are multiple ways to go for the OTK: <ol>  	<li>Via Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Make it with Power Bond, destroy the backrow and send 2 LIGHT Machines to the GY to have 3 Attacks with 4200. Can go to 6300 with Cyber Dragon Sieger or 8400 with Limiter Removal</li>  	<li>Make Nova via Cyber Dragon and Galaxy Soldier, Galaxy Soldier send Cyber Dragon Herz or Machine Duplication on Herz, Core or Nächster. Summon back 1 Cyber Dragon with Nova. From there you can go for Sieger to boost Nova to 4200 and then Nova can boost itself to 6300 by banishing Sieger. Or you just banish the CyDra with Nova and double it with Limiter Removal for 8400. Then in MP2 summon Infinity with it so it doesn't die. Or if you have another level 5 on the field you can make a 2nd Nova and summon back another CyDra from the GY.</li>  	<li>If your opponent has left a 0 DEF Monster/Token on the field you can just try to get 3 CyDras via Machine Duplication or Normal Summon Core, add Emergency, add Nächster or CyDra, send CyDra with Nächster, special summon CyDra from Grave via Nächster; then use Power Bond</li>  	<li>Swarm the field with CyDras via Machine Duplication, Nächster or Nova and then run over your opponent with Limiter Removal</li>  	<li>Use Overload Fusion or Cyberload Fusion to go for Chimeratech Overdragon with a lot of materials and then run over all your opponents monsters (works best if your opponent has a lot of Face-up attack position monsters or 1 face-up attack position monster that can't be destroyed by battle. Works even better if you have Power Bond or Limiter Removal</li> </ol> Those are the 5 ways I mostly use for OTKs. I decimate my opponents board usually with either Chimeratech Megafleet or Chimeratech Fortress, if they have applicable targets; or with Forbidden Droplet. Infinity is mostly there to either protect your OTK or to have at least something when you have to go first.  You could also play Instant Fusion and Panzer Dragon for more level 5 material.  TL;DR: Use Machine Duplication/Cyber Dragon Nova/Cyber Dragon Nächster to put CyDras on the field, cut the opponents field down to size with Imperm/Droplet or the Chimeratechs, get high damage on board with Nova/Power Bond/Limiter Removal/Sieger, pick the right bossmonster for the job (Overdragon for a full field, End Dragon for a weak defender or Crooked Cook, Rampage and Twin Dragon for a semifull field with 1-2 Monsters, Nova and Sieger or a CyDra Swarm for a nearly empty field) if you have to go first/can't OTK use Infinity and or Cyber Dragon Enternal(if you get a machine-fusion in the grave) for some protection and pray"

The deck is a bit bulky at 45 cards (its getting harder and harder to figure out what to cut) but despite that it is fairly consistant because of the amount of draw and search power the deck has access to. There are some choices in here that could be changed, the deck doesn't need halq nearly as much as vanilla striker because of souls and the endymion line making it much easier to get into selene so that and possibly the veiler could be cut for another extra deck slot. You could potentially cut the second selene as well, but it is very good in the deck and two feels a little more comfortable to me."

Link down below:  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=AGG-NBOueCs&amp;feature=y"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=AGG-NBOueCs&amp;feature=y</a>)  Karakuri has had an in and out running since it's inception in the 5Ds era and beyond in all forms, and hasn't stopped being Yu-Gi-Oh's LolCow ever since then (even since the new support dropped for it). While it isn't a bad archetype nor the ability to conjure effects based on how changing their On field position does anything (except for their Level 9 Synchro Monster anyways); the fact that cards like ""Mecha Phantom Beast Enterblathnir"" and the usual Auroradon shenanigans *(that every Machine Syncho deck fetishes over)* exist right now seems to help them slightly in the uphill battle. However while they can get these things, doesn't mean that they truly seek the nourishment that other machine synchro decks that outperform them in every compacity can (including the appromentioned Mecha Phantom Beast and even the numerous variants of Synchrons). One apparent weakness Karakuri does come across very often is the usual effect negators like Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence; and the common trope of ""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"". While I do attend to use Crossout Designator to do a variable amout of handling against these examples, Karakuri's still have too many disruptions, and not enough room in their arsenal for me to fit in all at once. On other other hand, what I do know is that Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Artifact Lancea are also key players this format (alongside Artifact Scythe).  Triple Tactics Talent is another piece for Karakuri to use as another backbone to allow them to force cards out of your opponents hands; force  monster confiscation from your opponents' side of the field; or allow you to draw 2 with no cost. Also included is the use of Solemn Strike if I want to make a pave way to focus on more of my side deck utilities, or for some reason the monster effects that are being dished against me become a little too ""personal"".  Honestly I still have hope Karakuri can get the right tools it needs to become the truly functional deck it needs to be. Sure it doesn't have to stray out of it's out of the already memeish mechanic of ""Cause and effect""; but the least we can see is more cards that allow effects that can benefits from the change of battle positions at any given moment; or maybe even a way to protect their non synchro Karakuri monsters from negations and field destruction.

The deck was used from Silver to high Gold with a good win rate against rouge decks.,"This deck is based off of a basic Swordsoul-Tenyi deck, but since there is no Swordsoul cards in Master Duel, there are no Swordsouls. Opening any 2 Tenyi monsters is enough to go for a <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> or higher depending on the hand. Changing the synchros is not recommended except for <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> and <a data-name=""Crimson Blader"">Crimson Blader</a> unless you are experienced. The deck wants to summon <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a> and any synchro or effect link monster. If you have a <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> on the field, you need to either use it for a higher link or summon a level 8 synchro to make <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> during the opponents turn. The deck is weak to <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, but it can play around Tri-Brigade with an optimal hand and foresight. <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> is a pain to deal with for both you and the opponent, do not use it unless you are not planning on summoning a non-Tenyi from the extra deck for the rest of the turn. Do not use the graveyard effect of <a data-name=""Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou"">Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou</a> without planning ahead since it locks you out of summoning <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> tokens and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a> for the rest of the turn. It is better to use its normal summon effect  at the beginning of the turn after summoning your Tenyi cards since there is no drawback.

Many URs in this deck can be found in spacial packs. Others, except for Traptrix-specific cards, are staples that you'll have to craft anyway.  This deck can get you through lower ranks very easily. You might have to upgrade it around Gold rank tho, (upgrade path provided below and is shown in side deck)  The upgraded version of this deck, which I am using, is also doing not-so-bad in Platinum.  I mean, let's be real, this is by no mean anywhere close to being meta but it is extremely fun to play :) <h3>Upgrade Path</h3> I really only added Utopia Double Engine for end-game purpose. Without them it is very hard to clear out monster with high ATK/DEF. But they are somewhat inconsistent IMO, because I draw Double or Nothing all the time (kekw). So The first thing I would consider is to replace them with something else. (though if you don't mine playing potentially brick card then they are totally fine to play.  Here is an upgrade path (order does not matter, add what you think is more important) :  Main Deck : <ol>  	<li><strong>Ash Blossom</strong> → x3</li>  	<li>+ 2x <strong>Ice Dragon Prison</strong> (or x3) -- very good against Eldlich, Blue Eyes, etc.</li>  	<li><strong>Solemn Judgement</strong> → x3 / <strong>Solemn Strike</strong> x2 -- even more negate</li>  	<li><strong>Imperial Wall</strong> -- almost instant win against many decks.</li>  	<li><b>Pot of Prosperity → </b>x3</li>  	<li>(<strong>Maxx ""C""</strong>) -- somewhat optional IMO</li> </ol> Extra deck : <ol>  	<li>+ <strong>AA-Zeus</strong> and the Zoodiac engine.</li>  	<li>+ <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong></li>  	<li>+ <strong>Link Spider </strong>-- useful when you struck with Phantom Knight trap card and Parallel eXceed.</li>  	<li>Traptrix Sera → x3 -- optional</li>  	<li>Others staples -- honestly any good general rank 4 XYZ will do <ol>  	<li>Bagooska</li>  	<li>Knightmare Unicorn</li>  	<li>Knightmare Pheonix</li>  	<li>Borrelsword Dragon</li>  	<li>Redoer</li>  	<li>etc.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>"

Play this deck if you","Introduction To Pengu Frog-  Hello! My name is DapperCalf, and today Ill be explaining to you all why you should play the hottest new deck on the market: Pengu frog. Pengu frog is a board spam link/synchro centric water deck built around four seperate and powerful engines : The frog engine, the penguin engine, halqifibrax synchro summon chains, and the undine/crystron engine. Why invest your funds into pengu frog instead of playing, I dont know, a good deck? Good question! Let me answer that question with a better one; do you like toad puns? does the idea of playing a deck that contains penguin soldier excite you? Do the names TOADally awesome, roninTOADin, NOPEnguin, and MISTAR(mister and star its a whole thing idk google star boy) boy intrigue you? Is my third question the same as my first? Idk what else to put as an intro so Im just gonna go straight into the magic of explaining combos.  Genex undine opening: Summon genex undine(making sure to leave the space under your link zone open! dont make the same mistakes I do.) using his effect to send crystron rosenix to the grave, adding a genex controller to hand. banish rosenix from graveyard to create a token, use the token to make a link spider. use the link spider to special summon controller from your hand, use controller and link spider to make haliqfibrax, use haliqfibrax to special gluttonous reptolphion greethys, use greethys and undine to make penguin brave, using penguine brave to make penguin soldier. on your opponents next turn, you then have the option to use brave to flip soldier and then use haliqfibrax to make shooting star riser dragon, sending treeborn frog and using riser and soldier to make a borreload, attaching link spider for a negate. you can also just use formula syncron and brave, but then you lose a 4k~ atk beater and that makes me sad. if youve used any of the frog combos to get a frog in play, you can also opt to make trishula here(summoning treeborn frog with toadally awesome and using haliq for formula synchron and then using treeborn + brave + synchron)  Basic Frog Combo Opening: all this requires is swap frog + a water monster in your hand. discard a water monster and then send a ronin toadin from your deck to grave. then if you didnt send a frog from your graveyard, normal summon any water monster. use the water monster + swap frog to make a coral anemone. then use anemone to special summon swap frog from grave, sending another frog to use for ronintoadins effect. special ronin from grave with his effect, and make toadally awesome.  Advanced Frog Combo Opening: If you open with a ronin toadin or another frog in your hand, + a swap frog, you can do the above combo but end on mistar boy, coral anemone, AND toadally awesome. follow the above steps but when you special the swap frog from your grave, send another ronin toadin from deck to grave. then use swap frog and ronin to make a mistar boy, and then follow the rest of the steps as normal, banishing swap frog + your other frog to summon two ronins and make a toadally awesome using them.  Other cool things you can do: you can summon many water type links/appoulousa or access code hilariously easily using frogs + the genex undine combo. you can also do it withou an undine, using rosenix and swap frog as materials, linking them together for a halq, using halq to get a monster from deck, banishing swap frog to make ronin and then linking into an apo or ACT. all of that without even using your normal summon!  IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE: Ronin toadin makes amazing link material, due to it lacking even a soft once per turn on its effect, but cant be used as a synchro summon.  If you use anemone as a combo extender, it restricts you to summoning anything but water types for the rest of the turn.  Nopepenguin can be used as synchro material to summon brave, and then immediately resummoned using its effect when brave pulls out a penguin soldier from the deck and then linked away into something powerful  There are ALOT of very very strong synergies and combo lines and it would be crazy to sit here and list all of them, and I dont have the patience to do it, but this guide doesnt even scratch the surface of the crazy turns you can do. Ive completed the ""maxx C challenge"" twice with this deck.  the deck doesnt play maxx c because of how resilient it is and how much card advantage it can create, but it loses to it. very very badly. because of that, we run 3 ash blossoms and two called by the grave.  gameciel is the kaiju we play because of the typing, and being able to summon him in m2 to deal with tribrigade stuff after locking yourself out of summons with anemone has won me at least a few games.  Gluttonous reptolphins recursion effect actually comes into play suprisingly often and is a really powerful card in his own right.  This is my first time ever writing a guide for literally anything so I apologize for any typos that may exist. I couldnt find a guide or a decklist for anything remotely close to what ive come up with here, so I figured I might as well make one myself. if you have any questions, feel free to bother me on discord with them at DapperCalf#3203."

Features The First Darklord and The Chaos Ruler.,"EDIT: Needs revision, I missed the vital card text on <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> that reads ""...target 1 ""Darklord"" Spell/Trap in your GY..."" so this will not work with any Spell/Trap. I'm disappointed, but experimenting with other cards like <a data-name=""Spell Reproduction"">Spell Reproduction</a>...  I just built this deck, still playtesting. What sparked my interest in building the deck is the challenge in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel to ""Take control of X opponent monsters"". I also pulled <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>, so I thought it would be cool to summon him. I've experimented with <a data-name=""Darklord Nurse Reficule"">Darklord Nurse Reficule</a> deck, and wanted to build another Darklord deck, though I don't have much experience at all playing Fusion monsters.  So far, I have found that <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> + <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> is a great starting hand. Target <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> with Diviner, and then Dark Contact Ukoback to get <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> out fast.  <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Amdusc"">Darklord Amdusc</a> are great for playing Spell/Trap cards from the GY, like <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Greater Polymerization"">Greater Polymerization</a>. Sending the Spell/Trap cards you need in GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Grounds"">Foolish Burial Grounds</a>. I'm thinking that <a data-name=""Banishment of the Darklords"">Banishment of the Darklords</a> should usually fetch <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a>, as Contact is what gets you Ixchel or Amdusc on the field to start targeting Spell/Traps in the GY. Can also send <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to the GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Grounds"">Foolish Burial Grounds</a>, to prep counters to hand traps or monster effects, depending on your matchup.  Don't forget to take advantage of that card draw with <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a>!  Can use the link Code monsters from the extra deck if you get bricked on your starting hand/draws. <a data-name=""Halqifribrax"">Halqifribrax</a> --&gt; <a data-name=""Phonon Pulse Dragon"">Phonon Pulse Dragon</a> --&gt; <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> might work, though I have not needed to go that route in playtesting just yet.  <a data-name=""Darklord Enchantment"">Darklord Enchantment</a> and <a data-name=""Grinning Grave Virus"">Grinning Grave Virus</a> are mostly for fun and can be replaced by better cards.  I'm only Gold Rank in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, so I'm still learning! This is my first attempt at building a deck from scratch. Any help/tips, strats I have missed, or card suggestions, would be much appreciated. &#x1f64f;"

Double Summon lets you use two Royal Magical Library during this FTK","The idea of this deck is simple. Get all Forbidden One pieces in your hand during your first turn.  Royal Magical Library is a great help in that, and this deck focuses more than most other Exodia decks on making sure we have it on the field on your first turn. Piri Reis Map does exactly that. It does get negated by Ash Blossom, but as long as the opponent doesn't have that, it's another way to get Royal Magical Library on your field as soon as possible, to help with drawing cards.  Another thing that isn't common in decks like this is the use of Double Summon. Why use one Royal Magical Library when you can use two? If you can get both out, it can bring out so much advantage. This deck can have hands you cannot play with sometimes, but if you can manage to get two Royal Magical Library on the field, it's nearly always possible to have multiple cards you can play.  Foolish Burial Goods is in the deck to send Cursed Bamboo Sword to the GY. Doing so allows you to activate Cursed Bamboo Sword's final effect, usually to add Golden Bamboo Sword to your hand. If you already have that but no Equip Spell Bamboo Sword, you could add the one copy of Broken Bamboo Sword as well."

You will usually want to get either Live☆Twin Ki-sikil or Live☆Twin Lil-la out on the field turn one with your normal summon if you draw them or get them to your hand with Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch, then activate their effect to special summon the other one to the field from your deck. From there, you want to get out both Evil★Twin Ki-sikil and Evil★Twin Lil-la by link summoning one, then activating the effect to bring back one link material, link summon the other one with the material you brought back and the other link monster, then use their effect to bring back the other Evil★Twin from the graveyard. Depending on what you need right then and there, you have a few options. If you have Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, you can special summon it there for a 4400 Atk beatstick that can cut your opponents board to size, or you can summon unchained abomination or knightmare gryphon depending on your immediate needs. If you draw foolish burial, you'll want to send Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la to the graveyard. It was added as a way to more consistently get that card to a position it can be summoned in."

Generally focuses around getting the knights out so you can summon a god of your choice. Slifer is the most obvious choice because of Thunderspeed Summon, but Ra can also work. Obelisk is a bit tricky if you don't already have him in your hand, but Arcana Triumph Joker is a decent search of Thunderspeed as well. I also recommend running the supporting God Card spells so you can get the most out of them.  Extra Deck has the Arcana knights to go with the Poker Knights, along with the usual Knightmare link support. I decided to run Utopic Draco future here as well just because I pulled one a while back and wanted to see if I could make him work here as an alternate win option. Using tornado dragons to go into Utopic Future, then from there into Utopic Draco should be fairly easy to do with this deck. Even with negates the amount of cycling that you can do with the Poker Knights now gives them a lot of potential options.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this deck feel free to comment."

Yes, I am playing the boring ass Adventurer Token engine just because I can and it does not necessarily conflict with the deck, but hey. These slots could be for anything like hand traps or floodgates, or control tools like the Solemn traps, really. As per usual, the side will be the side deck of my preference, but it realistically could be for anything of your liking.  <strong>Addressing the list:</strong>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Kosmochlor"">Icejade Kosmochlor</a></strong> - <span>This is your boss monster of the deck. Her, alongside your Field Spell Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle and Icejade Curse effectively locks your opponent out of using monster effects on the field, essentially providing you a one-sided Skill Drain. With the help of Icejade Cradle, this three card combo setup is not really as hard as you might think to pull off.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Creation Kingfisher"">Icejade Creation Kingfisher</a></strong> - <span>One of your ways to interrupt your opponent, sadly it's not a Quick Effect, but it enables Icejade Kosmochlor to attack safely in Defense Position.</span>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a>, <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a>, and <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a></strong> - <span>As I have discussed in my previous Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll Icejades list (here's the link for those that are interested: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-shaddoll-icejades/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-shaddoll-icejades/</a>), it's a one card combo that essentially lets you search your Field Spell instead of spending <a data-name=""Icejade Aegirine"">Icejade Aegirine</a>'s effect to do so, with <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> as a bridge and also a discard fodder for your <a data-name=""Fateful Adventure"">Fateful Adventure</a>. <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a> is just a free draw card off of <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Erosion"">Icejade Erosion</a></strong> - <span>One of your primary forms of interruption. Is searchable, which is nice.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Fossil Warrior Skull Knight"">Fossil Warrior Skull Knight</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a></strong> - <span>Targeting Monster and Spell/Trap removal, respectively.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></strong> - <span>Could be used either as just <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> fodder or a way to recycle Icejade monsters from your GY to your hand.</span>  In conclusion, I think Icejades now have a game plan albeit slow and control/stun focused, although I still believe that they should receive a dedicated summoning mechanic support (hopefully through Fusion summoning, for obvious reasons) in the future, but as of now, I wouldn't say that they're in a bad place, nor are they unplayable. If I were to describe their play style, it's just not for everybody. There are some few quirks to it, but it's not flashy. They can comfortably play under floodgates like <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>, <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, and to an extent even <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. Overall, I think it's a deck that performs relative to what the pilot desires it to do, be it just as a complementary engine or as the center piece, or be it as a tool to help you Link climb due to the free bodies you can bring out to the board or to assist you in making a more control/stun focused game plan. I am excited to build this deck in real life and to see how well it fares against the other decks be it in or out of the ladder. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."
