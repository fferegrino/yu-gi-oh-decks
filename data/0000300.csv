","This Kozmo deck made for the N/R format is slightly bricky, but tons of fun to play. I've tested the amount of pilots and ships a lot and came to this combination. When the deck gets a well balanced hand it is one of the harder NR decks to beat. The amount of recursion in combination with the high attack power and powerful boss monster in Kozmo Forerunner, makes it so that if it isn't stopped early it will take the game over most decks in the N/R format.  The biggest odd-ball inclusion is probably Kozmo Dark Planet<strong>. </strong>But the reason behind his inclusion is to have a card to unbrick ship heavy hands as well as to be the biggest reduction you can get off Kozmo Delta Shuttle."

Not so long ago I also started the game for the first time and looked up for guide and beginners decks and tips and I feel like after a few months of playing the game I should help out new players that struggle in the same way as I did and with that let's the guide begin.  After you finish the tutorial you will get the choice to get one out of 3 decks : Power of the Dragon, Syncho of Unity and Link Generation, the choice don't really matter as you will get all 3 as you play the game but I do recommend going for the Link Generation deck as it has the SR LANphorhynchu that is used in the deck (notice that the card is not necessary for the deck if you already chosen a different one so do not craft it!)  After all of the data was downloaded you will see the main page of the game and have around 2000 gems to spend, go to shop - special - bundle deals in there you will have several one time deals you can buy that will give you 10 master packs + one powerful staple for 750 gems (I recommend to buy all of them once you made your first deck for ranking up) get as many of them as you can and then go to deck and create a new one or edit one of the two the game gives you.  To get all of the materials for this deck you can simply dismantle every N/R card that you just got from pack opening (notice that N/R tickets are very easy to get and crafting back any useful card you may dismantle would not be a problem) if you don't have enough materials you can use dust tornado, smashing ground , shield crush and so on as replacement for mystical space typhon and bottomless trap hole also focus on the Tenyi cards from both deck and extra deck first. For your convenience the cards in both the deck and extra deck are in order of the most important card to the least important as well.  This guide would not have combos as most of them are very basic and this deck is meant for a new player to learn on there own how a very basic version of the meta deck Tenyi-Sowrdsoul work and how to use most of the games mechanics while working on beating the solo mode.  One final tip is to also get the duel pass before you play pvp as it pay for itself ang give you SR/UR tickets the most valuable resources in the game.  I hope that you enjoyed this guide and will have a blast playing Yu-Gi-Oh!!"

The deck's main monsters consist mostly of monsters which want to banish cards or benefit from banished cards such as Gren Maju De Eiza, Necroface, or Eater of Millions. The Gandora portion of this deck interacts with the Graveyard in order to clear the field for massive attacks from these banish-centric monsters. In addition, Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure facilitate the banish pile for both players. It also runs a sizeable XYZs package and Link package that it may need to utilize."

Watts are quite bad as they are slow, most effects of Watt monsters activate during the Battle Phase. Their Spell/Traps are quite lackluster but Wattrain is a good way to turbo out Watt monsters to go into Synchros, the Hunder family also help in this regard (You can also run Brohunder if you, for some reason, need more searchers) and Thunder Sea Horse and Pot of Prosperity allows you to search your Watts or Hunders.  This deck is also decent at stalling.

Mostly the spice comes from using the free normal summon the deck has to summon condemmed witch , search droplet ( or chalice if you used shifter this turn or plan on using it ) , then tribute her in the opponents turn to summon barrier statue of heavens which is protected by backrow / your magnifica or by the droplet you searched.  There are a few interactions you need to become aware when using the build, as exosister cards have a few restrictions, a good example is if you have Litanai set and witch on the field , you need to wait for your opponent to normal summon, then chain witch, and chain to witch litanai, as she tributes for cost and this way you control no NON exosister monster meeting the condition. the chain resolves you banish their normal summon and get a barrier statue locking the game into light. Usually this is were the opponent will pass and you may still have a banish of Magnifica or set follow up at hand to end the game next turn. There are lots more interactions to play around but I will need some time to write them down and get accustomed myself with them first."

I wanted to make a Dragon Ruler deck that made use of the Mythic Water Dragon and Mythic Earth Dragon, Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon and Galaxy Tomahawk.  Dragon Rulers can be a complex deck with many diverging lines and combos done, look at a 2013 Dragon Ruler deck and try it out, it's genuinely really fun to figure out the lines and set up boards with Dracossack and (if you know other people who want to) play a Dragon Ruler mirror, its genuinely a really fun back and forth format (if you gentlemen Vanity's Emptiness/other floodgates out)  So, this deck is mainly aiming to use Galaxy Tomahawk to go into Harpie Conductor and then Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty for a Mist Valley Apex Avian in the end phase.  If possible, you want tuner access, either Destrudo through Dark Matter Dragon/Dragon Ravine or Jet Synchron in hand or Dragunity Remus for Dragon Ravine.  You can use Remus and any other Dragon Ruler to go into Romulus, enabling another Dragon Ravine dump and Remus revive for Halq.  If you can get Mythic Water Dragon and Mythic Earth Dragon in hand (either hard draw or the banish effects of Redox and Tidal) and you haven't normal summoned you can go into Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon and then into Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon which is a 3 dragon shrines in 1 (usually dump Destrudo + 2 Dragon rulers who's effects haven't been triggered yet)  Flamvell Guard is a Tuner and a FIRE Dragon so it can be searched by Blaster and can enable Halq.  End boards usually consist of at least 2 negates + Scythe Lock, but you can also end on Borreload Savage Dragon too alongside."

Not anymore; with Gigantic Spright and Spright Elf, the deck is able to set up a Todally Awesome with just 1 Swap Frog or Deep Sea Diva.  The CSM decklist was one attempt to bring back Paleo Frog. Despite its success, I felt that it was more a control centered spright variant as compared to a paleozoic frog deck. So today I bring to you, a new paleozoic frog deck that utilizes spright (extra deck) monsters, but not the other way around.  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Index</h2> <ul>  	<li>Why You Should Try This Deck</li>  	<li>Win Conditions</li>  	<li>Card Choices <ul>  	<li>Spell Choices</li>  	<li>Trap Choices</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Extra Deck Monster Choices</li>  	<li>Other Monster Choices</li>  	<li>Analysis of Possible Hands</li>  	<li>Notes</li>  	<li>Siding</li>  	<li>Conclusion</li> </ul> (Control F to find each section)  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Why You Should Try This Deck</h2> <h5>1) It's simple</h5> Simple decks are easy to play. If you are a beginner to the game, or if you want to enjoy a game of Yugioh without too much calculation, this is the deck for you. <h5>2) It's competitive</h5> While not technically meta, I can ensure you this deck has the ability to face against recent meta decks like Tearalament and Spright.  Against Spright - Going first, this deck can shut down normal Spright hands with a simple Canadia/Dinomischus, and any other extenders they have with Toadally Awesome and other trap cards. - Going second, this deck can break a full Spright board with Mystic Mine/Evenly Match/Lava Golem.  Against Tearalament - Tear is particularly weak against Mystic Mine, so going first or second, you can kill them with Mystic Mine. - Going first, this deck main decks 3 Trap Trick and 2 Dimensional Barrier, which you can utilize with your other trap cards and Toadally Awesome.  I have tested this deck against different meta decks, and it has so far proven itself to at least be described as a ""competitive rogue deck"". <h5>3) Dynamic Board</h5> This deck does not lose to a Dark Ruler No More, nor does it lose to Mystic Mine, nor does it lose to Skill Drain and other Shenanigans. Your board is Traps + Monster Negates. <h5>4) It's fun</h5> Ever felt that satisfaction when you Mystic Mine your opponent and they cannot do anything about it? Ever feel frustrated playing Spright when your opponent dark rulered your entire board? Ever felt nice that your opponent surrendered after eating 3 of your backrows? Then oh boy is this deck for you. We play yugioh because it makes us happy, and I can assure you, this deck will definitely bring a wholesome smile to your face.  <img class="""" src=""https://i.imgur.com/Cqzi4ZE.jpg"" width=""463"" height=""289"" alt=""image"" />  (Me after activating the 3rd Mystic Mine in a fun, interactive game)  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Win Conditions</h2> Win conditions are important, knowing what they are help you deviate towards different strategies in any given game. <h5>1) Control and Otk</h5> This is what you usually follow going first. The basic premise is that you want to set up a board with (possibly multiple) Toadally Awesome (or something like Spright Elf + Toadally Awesome) and traps to stop your opponent from playing. If you achieved that, you probably have a lot of materials in the coming turns, which you should utilize to summon borrelsword and otk your opponent. <h5>2) Mystic Mine and Deck Out</h5> This is what you usually follow going second. The majority of decks don't main deck s/t removal, meaning that this is an effective winning strategy in the first game.  In the games where side decks are involved, you can run solemn judgement and dark bribe to ensure the mystic mine stays. In the case that your opponent has 3 or more monsters on the board after your mystic mine resolves, you can also summon Toadally Awesome (nothing else) to prevent any s/t removals (remember, Toadally Awesome can tribute itself to negate anything. So if you need to, you can activate one of your own traps and negate it). <h5>Note: Be Flexible</h5> Often, you will deviate the win strategy given different situations. Sometimes, you should stall with Mystic Mine until you have enough resources to beat your opponent without the Mystic Mine, so you eventually get rid of the Mystic Mine (either through its own effect, or setting another Mystic Mine). Sometimes, you just don't have enough to beat your opponent via normal resources, so you use Mystic Mine. When you have Mystic Mine on the board, always make sure you have a way to continue the game if the opponent outs the Mystic Mine.  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Card Choices</h2> Besides the obvious line up of 8 frog cards and mystic mine related cards, other cards require a little bit of explaining. <h5>Spell Choices</h5> <em><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></em>: A counterpart to the mystic mine strategy as well as a decent disruption. It also helps you go into Sky Cavalry Centaurea into Downerd Magician into Zeus to clear the board going second.  <em><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></em>: A decent going first card to ensure that you get your Toadally Awesome on the board, and not a bad disruption.  <em><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></em>: This deck's extra deck is not tight; there's always at least 3, most times 6 extra deck monsters you don't need in any given situation. So Pot of Prosperity is a natural card to bring to make the deck less random. <h5>Trap Choices</h5> <em><a data-name=""Paleozoic Marella"">Paleozoic Marella</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mischief of Gnome"">Mischief of Gnome</a></em>: Marella and Lost Wind are there for the grind game. Marella gives extra materials and Lost Wind gives you two lasting effect negation. Interestingly, you can use Marella to dump Lost Wind or Mischief of Gnome, where Mischief of Gnome should be used against Spright.  <em><a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a></em>: To win with a trap deck, you need to have the right trap at the right moment. Trap trick helps with that.  <em><a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Paleozoic Canadia</a></em>: The best paleozoic traps. You can bring two of each, its your choice (as you can search it with trap trick).  <em><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a></em>: This is the shut down card. A trap deck always need something to completely stop their opponent from playing. A great card against a variety of decks, including Tearalament.  <em><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></em>: spell speed three monster negation are useful for a variety of reasons, from ensuring the activation of mystic mine to negating a hand trap when setting up your board to getting rid of your opponents monsters.  <em><a data-name=""Evenly Match"">Evenly Match</a></em>: A going second removal that is good for clearing both s/t and monsters. <h5>Extra Deck Monster Choices</h5> Besides the Zeus package, Paleozoic/Todally Awesome, and Spright monsters there are a few others that need a little bit of explaining. Note that the proportion of the Extra Deck monsters are only for reference; for example, exchanging <a data-name=""Paleozoic Anomalocaris"">Paleozoic Anomalocaris</a> for a copy of Toadally Awesome is a good idea.  &nbsp;  <em><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a></em>: To get rid of monsters that are unaffected by other effects.  <em><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a></em>: To get rid of potential floodgates or other s/t. However, you can exchange this with another more useful extra deck monster, because this deck main decks Paleozoic Dinomischus and Trap Trick, which can be used to remove floodgates.  <em><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a></em>: To otk. This is really important, finishing your opponent off and not giving them any chance for counter play is the way to go.  <em><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a></em>: For the case you draw a single swap frog: Almiraj helps you to summon Toadally Awesome. <h5>Other Monster Choices</h5> <em><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a></em>: For resolving Mystic Mine. I don't side Sphere Mode because they shift control.  <em><a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a></em>: Water attribute (can be discarded by swap from in edge cases), 1 card Toadally Awesome + Spright Elf, what else can you ask for?  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Analysis of Possible Hands</h2> Paleozoic Frog ""combos"" are simple and easy. The main point is to get at least 1 swap frog into rotation with Gigantic Spright and Spright Elf (or even killing Dupe Frog) and eventually summoning Todally Awesome. However, there are still a few ideas you need to remember. Easy means that you should play perfectly, and remember the play behind every possible hand. <h5>Hand 1</h5> Single <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>, no other monster.  1. Normal summon Swap Frog, dump Ronintoadin 2. Link summon Salamangreat Almiraj 3. Special summon Ronintoadin from grave 4. Summon Spright Elf 5. Use Spright Elf to summon Ronintoadin 6. Special Summon Gigantic Spright 7. Use Gigantic Spright to summon Swap Frog 8. Dump Dupe Frog or Swap Frog 9. Summon Ronintoadin from grave 10. Summon Toadally Awesome <h5>Hand 2</h5> Single <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, no other monster.  1. Summon Deep Sea Diva, use effect to special summon another Deep Sea Diva. 2. Overlay into Gigantic Spright. 3. Use Gigantic Spright effect to summon Swap Frog, Swap Frog dump Ronintoadin into grave. 4. Summon Spright Elf 5. Use Elf effect to summon Swap Frog, Swap Frog dump Dupe Frog/Swap Frog into grave. 6. Summon Ronintoadin, overlay into Toadally Awesome (Under the linked zone of Spright Elf) <h5>Hand 3</h5> Single <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, single <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>, no other monster.  Summon the Deep Sea Diva, follow Hand 2. The reasoning is this: the ""combo"" with either monster will be stopped by a single hand trap, but summoning Deep Sea Diva keeps the Swap Frog in your hand (Swap Frog provides more flexibility in later turns), and it also results in Spright Elf + Toadally Awesome instead of just Toadally Awesome. <h5>Hand 4</h5> <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + another Frog, no other monster.  This one is a bit tedious but instructive, so please follow the logic. Common hand traps in this format are: Ghost Ogre, DD Crow, Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, and PSY-Frame Gear Gamma, with PSY being the least common (common in Spright decks but in general not so much) and the one where this hand cannot deal with no matter what. So we take PSY out of the equation and only consider Ghost Ogre, DD Crow, Ash Blossom, and Infinite Impermanence.  Let's say we are in game 1, your opponent doesn't know what you are playing and will probably assume you are playing Spright.  We start with two choices, normal summon the Swap Frog or special summon it. 1. We only consider single hand trap and don't consider opponent having 2 or more hand traps as this hand cannot play through two hand traps no matter what. 2. Either way, this hand plays through an Ash Blossom or Infinite Impermanence. 3. If your opponent doesn't know what you are playing, they will save the Ghost Ogre (the correct choice against a Spright deck) no matter what you choose. If they do use the Ghost Ogre on your Swap Frog, then either way your combo is stopped. 4. So we think of a way to bait out the DD crow.  The correct way is this: to special summon the swap frog, dump a frog so that you can then attempt to special summon a Ronintoadin from grave. If your opponent don't know what you are playing, they probably will shot gun the DD crow (if they have it) as normal Spright deck run one Ronintoadin. If this happens, bounce the Swap Frog back to your hand and follow Hand 1.  If nothing happens, your opponent probably don't have a DD crow. So bounce your swap frog back to hand, normal summon it to send another Ronintoadin to grave. Now your opponent possibly have Ghost Ogre/Infinite Impermanence/Ash Blossom. You have 3 choices: special summon Toadally Awesome, special summon Spright Elf, or special summon Gigantic Spright.  1. Summon Toadally Awesome: dies to Ghost Ogre (if you attempt to activate the Standby Phase effect of Toad) or Infinite Impermanence in the next turn. 2. Summon Spright Elf: dies to infinite Impermanence. 3. Summon Gigantic Spright: dies to Ash, Infinite Impermanence, and Ghost Ogre.  Both 1. and 2. are possible, but Spright Elf gives us a better board (Toadally Awesome + Spright Elf), and decent resource recovery in the following turn if stopped by Infinite Impermanence, so we summon Spright Elf. Use Spright Elf to special summon Swap Frog, dump a frog, summon Ronintoadin from grave, then overlay into Toadally Awesome (under the linked zone of Spright Elf).  If your opponent do know what you are playing, choose 1. and do not activate during your opponent's Standby Phase.  In general, if your opponent don't know what you are playing: 1. Special summon Swap Frog 2. Special summon Ronintoadin from grave 3. Bounce Swap Frog back, normal summon it to dump another Ronintoadin 4. Special summon Spright Elf 5. Revive Swap Frog, dump another frog 6. Special summon Ronintoadin 7. Overlap into Toadally Awesome (under the linked zone of Spright Elf)  If they do know what you are playing: 4. Special summon Toadally Awesome. 5. Do not activate during your opponent's Standby Phase.  The above play maybe subjected to change depending on how well you know your opponent's deck. <h5>Hand 5</h5> <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + another Frog + <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, no other monster. 1. Special summon Swap Frog 2. Special summon Ronintoadin from grave 3. Special summon Toadally Awesome. 4. Follow Hand 2. (Put the two Toadally Awesome in the linked zone of Spright Elf) <h5>Hand 6</h5> 1 <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + 2 other Frogs This rarely comes up, but the general idea is to summon 1 Toadally Awesome first, then continue with whatever you can do next.  For something like 1 Swap + 1 <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> + Another Frog try: 1. Special summon Swap Frog throwing the other frog, keeping 1 Dupe Frog in hand. 2. Special summon Ronintoadin from grave. 3. Bounce Swap Frog back, normal summon it again to dump 1 ronintoadin 4. Special summon Toadally Awesome. 5. Normal summon Dupe Frog 6. Continue from Hand 1-Step 2, but at Hand 1-Step 7 detach a material (the swap frog) from Toadally Awesome. 7. You should find that you have an extra material to go into another Spright Elf (Using the Ronintoadin and Gigantic Spright) 8. Your final board is two Toadally Awesome and one Spright Elf. Be mindful of hand traps and follow logical analysis as I did in Hand 4.  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Notes</h2> 1. Remember that <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a> has a secondary effect, where monsters in its linked zone cannot be targeted by your opponents effects. 2. Remember that <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> can bounce itself back to hand even after negated by Infinite Impermanence. 3. Remember that Swap Frog's ""bounce back to hand"" effect grants a second normal summon to a dupe frog in hand. 4. Remember that <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> can tribute itself to negate to dodge forbidden droplet.  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Siding</h2> 1. Tearalament tend to be really weak against Mystic Mine. Going second, you might want to go all in on ensuring you find your Mystic Mine, resolve it, and keep it on the board. So side in all Solemn Judgement, Dark Bribe, Evenly Match, and Terraforming. Side out all Solemn Strike, Canadia, and Marella. Going First, side in all Dimensional Barrier, Lost Wind, Solemn Judgement; side out 1 Mystic Mine, 3 Paleozoic Canadia, and 1 Forbidden Droplet. 2. Remember to side in Mischief of Gnomes for Spright going first. 3. A general rule of thumb is to always side in all Solemn Judgement going first. I will finish this section in a later update.  &nbsp;  <hr />  <h2>Conclusion</h2> If you want to try a new trap deck that is somewhat competitive in the current format, this is the deck for you. Hope you enjoy it, if you have any feedback or are confused about something, please comment below. Before you compliment my toxic nature, remember, garbage tends to be toxic."

If you have seen my other decks you get the idea of what's going on here.  Today I've make a Labrynth and Dragonmaid combo deck that I believe works quite well. I liked the theme of beautiful mansions and monster-girl maids with the Dragonmaid archetype and found a similar esthetic in the Labrynth cards, So once again I've decided to make a deck out of a theme I like.  The main strategy with this deck is to use the Labrynth cards to set up a defense while you try to get <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Sheou"">Dragonmaid Sheou on the field to establish board control. </a>  A few strategies are:  Using <a data-name=""Welcome&lt;a data-name=&quot;Labrynth Labrynth&quot;&gt; Labrynth&lt;/a&gt;"">Welcome</a><a data-name=""Labrynth Labrynth""> Labrynth</a><a data-name=""Labrynth Labrynth""> to summon </a><a data-name=""Arianna the Labrynth Servant"">Arianna the Labrynth Servant</a><a data-name=""Arianna the Labrynth Servant""> and using her effect to get </a><a data-name=""Lady of the Labrynth"">Lady of the Labrynth</a><a data-name=""Lady of the Labrynth""> in your hand then using her effect to special summon her. This gets you 2 fairly strong monsters as a defense or for stalling.</a>  Using <a data-name=""Lady of the Labrynth"">Lady of the Labrynth</a> to get you another <a data-name=""Welcome&lt;a data-name=&quot;Labrynth Labrynth&quot;&gt; Labrynth&lt;/a&gt;"">Welcome</a><a data-name=""Labrynth Labrynth""> Labrynth</a> and special summoning <a data-name=""Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle"">Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle</a><a data-name=""Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle"">. You can use her effect to grab traps from the grave and set them to the field.</a>  And finally, <a data-name=""Using &lt;a data-name=&quot;Lady of the Labrynth&quot;&gt;Lady of the Labrynth&lt;/a&gt;"">Using </a><a data-name=""Lady of the Labrynth"">Lady of the Labrynth</a> to search your deck for Dragonmaid normal traps. This is really helpful to be able to use the whole gimmick of the Dragonmaid cards, Returning them to the hand to activate their effects.  If you've actually read through all of this I appreciate it and I hope you like my deck.  Cheers,"

Huge Revolution, if United Resistance, People Running About, and Oppressed People are all on the field, forces the opponent to discard their entire hand and destroy all cards they control essentially resetting them to zero cards. To facilitate this strategy the deck uses cards such as Treasure Panda, Summoner Monk, Enchanted Fitting Room, Gold Sarcophagus, Unexpected Dai, and other cards in order to dig through the deck to find the normal monsters. For survivability it also runs a small level 4 spam package in Goblindbergh and Summoner Monk in order to go into generic Rank 4 XYZs cards and also runs a sizeable Link package that could potentially (but rarely) end on a Borreload Dragon."

CHANGE MY MIND!!!  Ok with the meme out of the way let me explain the Deckbuilding process. I just put XYZ Rank 4 Cards, and used the Time Thiefs as the main engine due to the fact I made this decklist as a basis for a friend who wanted to try a Deck with a Extra Deck (His only deck it's Phantasm Spiral with Link Spider as his only Extra Deck Monster), so I asked him if we would like me to build him Time thiefs due to the fact I tried to build them but I got a Time Thief + Suship Deck and my Time Thief cards were just laying there in my collection, so I asked him if he would like me to try to build a budget version of the deck, try to get the parts and sell it to him, if you noticed some of the Time Thief cards could be runned at less copies like Chronocoder due to not having a great effect tbh but that's 'cause I already have 3 copies of Chronocoder IRL so I'm trying to build it as fast as possible. Any suggestion could be useful, the same can be said of Summoner Monk, Photon Thrasher. Oh and the Side Deck it's more options that could be useful instead of a proper Side Deck, probably I'll make a proper Side Deck in the future. But most likely when I already build the Deck and more to trying to help my friend with that. See you next time"

See, the only bad part about playing Tearalament is the random nature of the mills. With Krawler Dendrite, you can send a specific card to the graveyard on the opponent's turn, creating a Winda if you have not already, or setting up a sequence of plays by making Kitkalos.

Do just that with this deck!","With the new Ninja support cards, the archetype can move into more of a combo space and really let their versatility shine. Because of the flexibility Ninja has, you can push your deck strategy into a variety of ways to fit the player playstyle and/or the current meta. You can shift into a more control style, go full on crazy and make huge boards, or anything in between. This deck is more of a middle ground, in my opinion.  Before I get into the deck strategy it must be said that Ninja still do have a very weak early state, but can still make good budget boards. If the opponent opens up with too much disruption it can be very hard to push through unless you have the right cards. But that can be said about for almost any non-meta deck. Also it is very important to know, Isolde and Saryuja are major choke points of this deck. If either gets stopped, then that's pretty much game. But if you can get past that point you're home free.  Now into the combos. I will mainly go over the big bombastic board.  For starters you want to open with anything that will let you get to Isolde. Essentially, you just need to find a way to get any 2 Warrior monsters on the field. Opening Hanzo with Tobari, Golden Ninja with a trap, Hanzo with Jogen, Tobari with Kagero and another Warrior, or any Warrior with Fire Flint. No matter how you want to structure your deck, it all comes down to getting to Isolde. Isolde will activate her first effect to search out Kai-Den.  From Isolde you want to mill 4 of your equip spells to get a Hanzo or Golden Ninja then go into Saryuja to summon out a Hanzo or a Getsuga. Link off Saryuja for Zealantis to reuse your Hanzo effect(s). From there the board you want to make is up to you. Generally I like to end on a 2400 Apollusa with a face-up Meisen, Mitsu, and Hanzo with a Ninjitsu Art of Transformation in the backrow.  Over the course of the turn you will be searching a lot with Hanzo. In the early stages you want to prioritize getting Kai-Den, Jogen, Getsuga, and Green Ninja in your hand. Then after that you can pivot into whatever you want.  In my opinion the most optimal opener is with Hanzo and Jogen in hand. While it is the riskier opener, it gives a lot of value. The play is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Hanzo NS to search your preferred ninjitsu art trap then SS Jogen using the searched trap</li>  	<li>Link into Isolde and use effect to get Kai-Den to hand</li>  	<li>Mill 4 equip spells to summon Golden Ninja, then Golden Ninja send the trap to summon Hanzo</li>  	<li>Hanzo search Getsuga then Link into Saryuja. Saryuja use effect to summon Getsuga</li>  	<li>Getsuga summon 2 Hanzo. Hanzo search Baku and Jogen, then summon Baku from hand and get your trap back</li>  	<li>Link summon Zealantis only using Saryuja and use Zealantis effect to resummon the board and use Hanzo effects</li>  	<li>Hanzo search Green Ninja and Mitsu, then link Cross-Sheep using Zealantis and a Hanzo</li>  	<li>Summon Meisen using Baku and Hanzo, make sure to sit Meisen where Sheep is pointing to resummon Hanzo <strong>AND</strong> make sure to use Green Ninja effect here to flip Hanzo</li>  	<li>Hanzo search Kagero. Link Getsuga and Green into Saizo, grab your preferred ninjitsu <strong>AND</strong> flip hanzo back up</li>  	<li>Place your pend scales and summon Kagero and anything else you might want, be sure to leave a space if you want to use Kagero effect but its optional but do not summon Mitsu</li>  	<li>Xyz Kagero and Hanzo into a Rank 4 of your choice, preferrably Number 60. If you use Number 60, use second effect to resummon Hanzo and grab Tobari</li>  	<li>Link Number 60, Saizo, and Sheep into Apollo then SS Mitsu and set your backrow</li>  	<li>On opponent's draw phase if you have transformation, tribute Hanzo to summon Apex Avian</li>  	<li>When opponent activates a card, use Meisen to set Black Dragon Ninja face-down and flip with Mitsu</li> </ol> &nbsp;  It's a lot, but there is a lot of flexibility in what you do and how you craft your board. You can cut it shorter to have a more full board of ninja. You can play around early hand traps by going directly into Saizo or Meisen early. I have another deck that ends on a board of Time Thief Redoer, Toadally Awesome, Bahamut Shark, 1600 Apollo, and Meisen with Mitsu. I even experimented and the deck can end with Uptoic Draco Future on board. There are a lot of strong monsters you can set up on your turn going first or second, again provided you can play through disruption."

Depending on the starting hand, the duel can lean more toward&nbsp;Hieratics or Ogdoadics, although a mix of both often ends up happening. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll have some level 4 monsters, and if you have either of the Ogdoadic Remnants then you can send them to the GY to send either a LIGHT or DARK Ogdoadic from the Deck to the GY, which can help set up some tribute-Special Summons from the GY. Then, if you have another level 4 monster, either Hieratic Gebeb or Nuit, or either of the Ogdoadic Boundless you can Special Summon the Remnant from the GY and then Normal Summon the other level 4 monster to overlay them and XYZ Summon King of the Feral Imps. Doing this can allow you to use the King&rsquo;s effect to set up more Ogdoadic GY tribute-Special Summons. Be sure to detach the material based on which from-the-GY effect you want to use first!
