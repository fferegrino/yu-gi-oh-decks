After hitting platinum I swapped to Sky Striker so not sure how it fairs beyond that.  It's a modification of my 2020 OCG deck with minor differences, read it up to understand its combos there: https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-magician-deck-ocg/  Some key differences: <ul>  	<li>Dragoon is banned, so verte is usually used to fuse Magicians' Souls and Magician Rod together to get Dark Magician/Dark Magician girl on the field (depending which one you already have in GY, go for the other) through fusion deployment, instead of Red Eyes Fusion.</li>  	<li>Current environment is thriving with decks like Drytron so Nibiru is really great for that, though if you run into too much Eldritch you may take 1 out, or both.</li>  	<li>Palladium Oracle Mana isn't in so it kind of hurts a bit. Otherwise, if you can get number 42 out, you could summon Ip, vertes, and union train equip mana, and summon Mekkknight Crusadia next turn, dumping all 4 Soul Servant cards in the GY for insane draw. Moreover Mana just helps giving you a sticky board and some protection which is always nice, especially since you should not rely on eterneral soul too much.</li>  	<li>Currently Illusion of Chaos is also not available yet, but highly recommend going all three, really helps with bricking problem.</li> </ul>"

Duel Master:</strong> Charmers Deck  <img src=""https://nintendo-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1641952974_Yu-ki-oh-Preview-Master-Duel-Nintendo-Switch-Tower.jpg"" alt=""image"" />  The “Charmer”, or known as the “Spirit Charmer” is a standalone archetype of Spellcaster monster themed on controlling monsters with the same Attribute as them which is unfortunately not playable in any way without an exceptional support from another card. Surprisingly the new Archetype called “Magistus” came out soon after the “Spirit Charmer” was released in 2021. The “Magistus” archetype had a perfect synergy for the “Charmers” especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong> to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Summoner Mon&quot;&gt;Summoner Mon&lt;/a&gt;k"">k</a>” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  ___________________________________________  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck. You can still use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as usual to link summon “<a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magician"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magician</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&quot;&gt;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&lt;/a&gt;s"">s</a>” or ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" during your opponent's turn.  <span>There's a ton of cards that can be used for the Charmer deck strategies with different combination cards as we play them. You can still change it and/or make them stronger as you like. Just be more creative and make it simple as long as you're having fun...</span>  <img src=""https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/780e3a80-22e0-4110-99ad-399a6193aa0c/ddhy61m-c0ab7311-b2fb-48c0-8460-608956731b8f.jpg/v1/fill/w_1171,h_683,q_70,strp/familiar_possessed_playmat__blank__by_ygo_wallpapers_ddhy61m-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MjEwMCIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzc4MGUzYTgwLTIyZTAtNDExMC05OWFkLTM5OWE2MTkzYWEwY1wvZGRoeTYxbS1jMGFiNzMxMS1iMmZiLTQ4YzAtODQ2MC02MDg5NTY3MzFiOGYuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTM2MDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.6-4-xTfKHLUN6E7kCkT1jhMsNaHdxBK8o3J53Rt4oWk"" alt=""image"" />  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

And i swapped an astraltopia for a second astral kuriboh cause in playtesting if you draw too much astraltopia you're kinda dead in the water. aand i also swapped tornado for lightning blade.  banlist: added feather duster to the main deck due to skill drain being unlimited, although i took out xyz tactics for it buut basically the card isn't really needed and more overkill than nessesary, plus i don't really want to be drawing into any of my searchables with it either.  and for the extra deck i basically remade it, due to opening a bunch of space from F0 and the searcher xyz's going away, i added a second U-Double and utopia, and some more dragonar targets with 71, 84, 41, and 4(kragen). i also took out tornado dragon due to skill drain.  &nbsp;  i would replace the effect veilers here for forbidden chalice, but i currently don't have any forbidden chalices"

(I know how daunting it","Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with a more compact version of my previous Extra Deck Eldlich Monarch deck list that I posted a while ago as per request of the user GreenION. I've done most of the explanations there when it comes to my choices and general thought processes there so feel free to take a look at it if you fancy at this link down here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/eldlich-extra-deck-monarchs-master-duel/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/eldlich-extra-deck-monarchs-master-duel/</a>  No significant changes into the deck with the exception of it being the deck size from a 60 card list down to just 45, which isn't that bad, all things considered. One thing that you might consider adjusting the ratios of since this is a significantly smaller deck is <a data-name=""Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch</a> and <a data-name=""Erebus, the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus, the Underworld Monarch</a>. I personally prefer having more Ehther than Erebus and drawing them both when going second and especially when going first. Drawing Erebus going second would be stronger, though you can just tinker the ratios to your liking. So, yeah that's pretty much it."

The deck is capable to break board going second. It can also build a decent board going first. However, the main issue with madolche is consistency. Therefore, pot of prosperity is important. If pot of prosperity is too expensive, pot of extravagance can replace however it is way less good since madolche do not need the extra card. They need the key card. The second card is small world. It allows to search mageline, angelly or petite through hand traps which are all key starters of the combo. ex of small world: ash blossom -&gt; hootcake -&gt; and lvl4 madolche, or ghost bell -&gt; veiler -&gt; mageline  Having different hand trap for small world is also in synergy with crossout.  depending on the handtrap that you have there are multiple different ways to search the card through small world. If both previously mentioned cards are too expensive, you can choose to play a more going second version which drops all hand trap, pot, and small world (I admit that they are expensive) and adds cards which break boards such as dark ruler, harpie, kaiju, nibiru, and raigeki (back at 3 with the jan 2022 banlist).  In this deck, there is no side deck because it really depends on the format.  I do suggest cards like dark ruler, dimension shifter, lancea, droll. Regardless of what you choose, I suggest choosing cards that either has a board wipe or influence the entire board effect such as dark ruler or card that apply a rule such as droll, lancea which denie your opponent from one type of effect.  If cards like lightning storm aren't accessible and you need back role removal. Hey Tsunade is a decent choice. Since you do not need multiple turns as madolche player. 1 Turn is often enough.  Personally, the key card that wins me most of my duels is madolche teacher glassoufle. The shuffle-back effect from both gy is a really annoying effect for current format decks. The hard part is to know when to activate it. You have to do it 1 step before your opponent's foolish-like effect. Not 2 steps just 1 in order to trigger glassoufle's effect in the next chainlink.  &nbsp;  Reglardless, Madolche is a deck that have a lot of potential. It is not hard to learn the combo and fun deck."

We basically spin all of our opponent cards to their deck and swing with exactly 8000 for game.,"<span>Your goal with this deck is to (preferably) go second and utilize the Mekk-Knights to generate advantage with columns utilizing the cards from your opponent, especially with Purple Nightfall and Indigo Eclipse, to summon Rainbow Neos through Verte Anaconda.</span>  <span>Then, you will use Rainbow Neos effect to spin all of your opponent monsters or backrow using Verte as fodder or the spells/trap you used to create columns in the first place.</span>  <span>Also, since we're playing the Invoked Engine, we also want to setup Invoked Mechaba as soon as possible, since his 2500 ATK + 4500 ATK from Rainbow Neos + using Aleister effect from the hand to boost one of the 2 fusion by 1000 ATK = exactly 8000 LP for the OTK.</span>  Some additional info: <ul>  	<li>Why play Sangan? - We're playing Sangan since the deck would lack a good Normal Summon other than Aleister. We can link him off with Almiraj and get to search for any handtrap in the deck or Orange Sunset, which if we have a column setup with Almiraj, we can Special Summon him and link for Verte and so forth.</li> </ul> PS: Lightning Storm is kinda of a double-edge sword and very situational in this deck because it does its job too well. You wanna consider that the cards you're destroying clean-up the columns for your Mekk-Knights, so use it at your own discretion.  &nbsp;"

I was spoon-fed the entire archetype for spending some time in solo mode and then I pulled accescode, almiraj, and abomination.  I was also given link spider for choosing to start off with the cyberse deck, and also unexpected dai for the starting deck.  I pulled the diviners when attempting to make a makeshift megilith deck.  And my favorite part? Almost all of the world chalice link monsters have animations and 10 cards in the extra has animations, it makes it feel alive!  I am really glad and pretty darn lucky.  So here’s my current World Chalice build for master duel"

The Arrival Cyberse having effect immunity gives it unique advantages over certain ,"<span><strong>-Strategy</strong></span>  The main advantage this deck has are the 1-card <span>combos.</span> This gives you a lot of room for the rest of your hand to be dedicated for either countering the opponent's boards or protecting your own plays.  When going first, the goal is to combo into The Arrival Cyberse + Cyberse Quantum Dragon. Most decks can't deal with The Arrival, so as long as you can protect it from getting beaten over you should have control of the game.  When going second, you combo into the 2300 attack Extra Deck @Ignisters and Accesscode Talker to boardwipe the opponent and go for an OTK.  <span><strong>-Decklist</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span><em>Achichi</em>/<em>Pikari</em></span>/<em>Cynet Mining</em>/<em>AI Meet You</em>: These are all essentially your 1-card combo starters. In mid to late game, <em>Pikari</em> gains greater value due to it's ability to search for the in-themed <em>Monster Reborn</em> cards. Do note that <em>AI Meet You</em> is not usually used as a combo starter, so if you use it that way it will produce the weakest board (<em>The Arrival Cyberse</em> without <em>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</em>.)</li>  	<li><em>Ignister AILand</em>/<em>Doyon</em>/<em>Buruburu</em>/<em>Danmari</em>: These are all combo pieces that you get out from the deck to continue your combo. <em>Ignister AILand </em>is used to enable your special summons. <em>Doyon </em>adds @Ignister monsters and spells back to your hand. <em>Buruburu </em>is the Tuner of the deck which can be searched by <em>Cyberse Wicckid</em>. <em>Danmari</em> can be sent from the deck to the grave via <em>Buruburu</em> which allows it to be used as a one time Omni-Negate as long as The Arrival Cyberse on board.</li>  	<li><em>FAIghting Spirit</em>/<em>AIdle Reborn</em>/<em>Monster Reborn: </em>These are all basically <em>Monster Reborn</em> which allows you to recover your plays in case you get interrupted. If you have at least 2 of these, you can recover from <em>Nibiru</em> depending on where in the combo it is activated. <em>FAIghting Spirit </em>has an interesting interaction with <em>Achichi's</em> graveyard effect which results in <em>The Arrival</em> <em>Cyberse</em> from being unable to be destroyed by battle.</li>  	<li><em>Maxx C</em>/<em>Nibiru</em>/<em>Ash Blossom</em>/<em>Ghost</em> <em>Belle</em>/<em>Infinite Impermanence:</em> Due to how compact the combos are, you can afford to play a large variety of hand traps. <em>Maxx C</em> is the only I really consider a must have since it can unbrick your hand or let you draw into <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> or your other handtraps. The rest is up to preference. I only play 1 <em>Ash Blossom</em> and 1 <em>Impermanence</em> for <em>Crossout Designator.</em> <em>Ghost Belle</em> has some interesting application against meta decks like Eldlich and Tri-Brigade, but it is replaceable for something else if you prefer.</li>  	<li><em>Called by the Grave</em>/<em>Crossout Designator</em>: The deck is vulnerable to handtraps so these cards are necessary for protecting your combos.</li>  	<li><em>Forbidden Droplet</em>: Useful whether you are going first or second. When going second, this is your main board breaking card outside of <em>Nibiru</em>. When going first, the attacking reducing effect helps protect <em>The Arrival Cyberse</em> from getting beaten over.</li> </ol> <span><strong>-Extra Deck Combo Routes</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Dark Infant -&gt; Cyberse Wicckid -&gt; Splash Mage -&gt; Dark Templar (Preferably in the right EMZ) -&gt; Route A or B</li> </ol> A) Summon your second Dark Infant under Dark Templar in the middle column and then combo into Cyberse Quantum Dragon and then The Arrival Cyberse right after.  B) Summon your second Dark Infant under Dark Templar in the middle column and then combo into Wind Pegasus, Light Dragon, and Accesscode Talker for boardwiping and OTK.  2. Accesscode Talker Double Attack OTK  If you can summon Splash Mage + another Cyberse monster, then you can use Splash Mage's effect to revive a monster from the graveyard. From there, you can link the revived monster and your other Cyberse monster on the field for Update Jammer. Link Update Jammer and Splash Mage for Accesscode Talker. Doing this will enable Accesscode Talker to attack twice for an OTK. This is the most resource efficient OTK, but should only be done as a last resort if combo 2B fails or cannot be done.  <span><strong>-Notes</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Space Insulator is used as generic Cyberse Link in order to get rid of things like Nibiru, Nibiru Tokens, and Lost World Tokens off of your field. This is because @Ignister AILand's effect cannot activate as long such cards are in your Main Monster Zone.  </span></li>  	<li>Update Jammer's board effect doesn't reduce The Arrival's attack to 0, so you can use these two together to beat over an unusually high attack power monster. However, this is a really rare scenario.</li> </ol>"

It's a good engine for link summoning since most the time you don't need to search out a Ki-sikil or Lil-la (as they can special summon each other from the deck, aside from Treat and Frost).  The idea for this deck is to get as many materials on the field as possible and have enough to special summon their Evil★Twin link monsters. Both Evil★Twin links summon the other from the graveyard, so if one is taken out, you can immediately special summon the other from the graveyard and get effects based on which was special summoned that way. I will not be covering any staples in the deck (Maxx ""C"", Ash Blossom, Nibiru, Triple Tactics, Effect Veiler, etc.). This deck is a bit tricky to play, you have to bait your opponent out (which you should mostly always be doing) in order to make them use their effects and/or to see what they have (in this case, hand traps). Although it's not the end of the world if you Ki-sikil or Lil-la's searcher effect is negated, it does stop you from having another body on the field.  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  <strong>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil / Lil-La</strong> - These 2 are the main searchers in the deck, you'll always want at least one of these in the hand, as when one is normal or special summoned while you have no monsters on the field, you can special summon their twin counterpart (if you normal summon Lil-la, you'll get Si-sikil and vice versa). Their life burn and gain effects are mostly secondary as you won't really have these on the field most of the time outside of when you need to link summon.  <strong>Live☆Twin Treat / Frost</strong> - If you have a Lil-la or Ki-sikil on the field, you can special summon them based on which of the twins are on the field (Ex: if you have a Ki-sikil, you'll summon a Treat). These are the ideal targets for being sent to the GY as either link material or for a discard (Ex: using Live☆Twin Home), and they both have GY effects. Frost banishes itself when your opponent draws a card, you draw a card. Treat banishes itself when someone takes damage involving a Evil★Twin monster  <strong>Evil★Twins Ki-sikil and Lil-la</strong> - The main boss (aside from Sunny, which is not in at the moment), her main destructive effect can be pretty great at breaking boards (she makes it so your opponent has to send every card they control to the GY, until they have just 2). Although that effect isn't bad, the main point of her is to either be a discard (since she can special summon herself from the GY by using 2 link monsters) and to be a big beatstick (if you have a Ki-sikil or Lil-la in your GY (which you almost always will), she gains 2200 ATK and DEF, making her 4400 ATK/DEF).  <strong>Honest / Dark Honest</strong> - You can swap these out for something else, but for the most part, these cards can win you the game depending on how they're used. Best used if you have a Treat in the GY, so when they swing into you, you can use either Honest, banish Treat, and then decrease the attack of 1 other monster by that amount. You can swap the Dark Honest for Honest, but this deck is primarily dark monsters so that's what I put in.  <strong>Spells:</strong>  <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> - I know this is a staple, but it works extremely well in this deck, especially since neither Evil★Twin or Live☆Twin has any real attack power, outside of Evil★Twin's boss monster. Negating effects and halving the enemies attack power is great, especially if you have a Lil-la Treat in the GY and can swing over enemies (it can also stop spells/traps making it a pretty vital card in a deck with little-to-no negating effects).  <strong>Secret Password</strong> - The 2nd main searcher for the deck, this searches out for either twins spells and traps (or if you have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la on the field, you can add the Evil★Twin boss monster to your hand. This will be your main ""bait"" card, mainly for Ash Blossom, as most of the time you'll have either a Ki-sikil or Lil-la (or more) in hand. Ideally you'll search out a Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch (which I'll explain below).  <strong>Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch</strong> - The main searcher for the deck, it allows you to search for one Live☆Twin monster (you can choose what to add to your hand depending on what you have in-hand. If you want reassurance on the next turn, you can always search out a Lil-la or Ki-sikil, though if you want more link materials on board, you can search out a Frost or Treat (which if you plan on linking, is a good idea).  <strong>Live☆Twin Home</strong> - Home is a decent card for the most part, but it depends on what you have in-hand, I only put it at 1 because it's searchable with 'Secret Password' and because it's usually not needed as most of the time you'll have ways to special summon the twins. This can come in clutch if you really need it to, though, so I'd recommend at least having it. Sending 'Evil★Twins Ki-sikil and Lil-la' to the GY with it's effect is the best case scenario (but don't count on it unless you plan on drawing it or plan on searching it with no interruptions).  <strong>Extra deck:</strong>  <strong>Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</strong> - You'll be seeing this and Lil-la's link monster quite a lot, as with one you get the other. Ideally if you're going first, this is the first card you link into, because whichever of the twins you link into first, will be the one that's last on the field, and whose effect will activate. When she's special summoned and you have a Lil-la monster on the field, you can draw one card (usually that'll be her link counterpart). If you have don't have a Lil-la on the field,  you can special summon one Lil-la from the GY.  <strong>Evil★Twin Lil-la</strong> - Lil-la is the same as 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil', except for a few things; if you have a Ki-sikil on the field, you can destroy 1 card on the field (this does target), and if you don't have a Ki-sikil on the field, you can special summon one from the GY.  <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> - She's mainly here as support for any link monster, as she has a quick effect that says you can link using materials you control during your opponent's main phase 1, and when she's used as link material, the monster that was link summoned can't be destroyed by card effects.  <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> - A great staple for any link deck, when he's link summoned, you can target 1 link monster in your GY and gain attack equal to that link's rating x 1000. He also has the effect of banishing 1 link from your graveyard to destroy 1 card on the field, which is not once per turn.  <strong>Link Disciple / Link Devotee</strong> - I put these together because they're a great pair and because they're cheap. Link summon Disciple and then Devotee underneath, tribute Devotee, you'll then be able to draw 1 card (in which you'll have to put 1 card on the bottom of the deck), and you'll gain 2 Cyberse link materials. Since you won't be able to link into Link-3 or higher for the rest of the turn, if you have a Lil-la or Ki-sikil on board, you can go into their link monsters. You can also go into I:P Masquerena using the two tokens and then into a link-3+ monster next turn (preferably Excode Talker since your twins can also gain ATK and protection), gaining destruction protection.  <strong>Knightmare Links</strong> - I'm grouping all 3 together just for simplicity, they all have pretty self-explanatory effects. To simplify, Phoenix can pop 1 trap/spell on the field, Unicorn can shuffle 1 card on field back into the deck (this targets), and Gryphon can set 1 spell or trap from your GY. They all have effects based on if they're co-linked or not.  <strong>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</strong> - She has many uses, the main use being able to use 1 monster your opponent controls as materials (bonus points if they're a link monster), she's unaffected by cards, unless they target (so 'Forbidden Droplet', which targets, will not effect her), and she can negate any effect that lets your opponent special summon from the GY, once per turn.  <strong>Transcode Talker </strong>- Transcode is an amazing card in this deck, not only does it provide protection to co-linked monsters and give them a +500 ATK boost, but it can also special summon one Link-3 or lower Cyberse monster from your GY (which most likely would be I:P).  <strong>Side-deck:</strong>  You can tech many things in here if you want, such as 'Royal Decree' (which negates all traps on the field) which would work since this deck doesn't really play any traps (aside from Imperm). These are the main ones for me:  <strong>Parallel eXceed</strong> - This is a great option for really any link deck, you can put in 2 or 3 (3 if you want to draw it more) so you basically have 2 free link materials. When you link summon, and eXceed is in your hands, you can special summon it and another (from hand or deck) to the field where the link monster points to.  <strong>Royal Decree -</strong> Royal Decree is a decent option for this deck, as it runs only 2 traps, though do note that it's pretty easy to get off the field since we don't have much of any protection.  <strong>Tri-Gate Wizard</strong> - This link monster is pretty easy to get on the field (even moreso with 'Parallel eXceed') and gains effects based on how many cards are co-linked with it. It can be pretty easy to get on the field and make annoying to get off (with I:P and 'Transcode Talker')  <strong>Main weaknesses:</strong>  This archetype doesn't have much of any protection by itself, whether that's negation effects or attack power, so it will have to rely heavily on your other link monsters. By itself, the main idea for the links is to take the damage (or if you used the field spell, which you shouldn't, to negate the attack) and use the effects from the destroyed twins to make sure you last. This deck is very weak to things like 'Necrovalley' (but it does have outs, like 'Feather Duster' and 'Knightmare' links), as they rely heavily on their GY. If your opponent knows your deck, then stopping you can become pretty easy early on (you'll still want to bait anyone out using cards how you see fit). This deck also can have trouble with banishment, though it's still a decent engine to link into other monsters.  <strong>Getting Started:</strong>  This deck has many, many combos, and many ways to play, but for the most part, you'll start off with summoning your twins (mainly Ki-sikil and Lil-la, not their Treat or Frost versions) and linking into their links. Whichever link you start with first (unless you have one on the field) you'll end on, so if you link to 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil', you'll end on 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil' (which is great for going first, since you get to draw a card).  This deck has a <strong>lot</strong> of drawing power, you can make use of that by baiting some of your opponents with excess cards (or keeping them in hand, up to you), it can make playing a lot smoother. Some of the links (namely 'Devotee' and 'Disciple') make linking that much easier, so you can get out not only your twin links, but a Link-3 (by using I:P next turn) to go into something like 'Tri-Gate Wizard' or 'Transcode Talker' (which can also special summon a Link-3 from the GY). Having access to lots of Link materials means you can also use something like 'Underworld Goddess' to help clear any boss monsters they may have that you can't remove or swing over."

Presenting, Eldlich Shiranui.  First things first, this is not exactly a meta build, but I gotta say that I'm <strong>REALLY</strong> impressed on how budget this deck can be built. Playing through the solo mode and finishing the Shiranui portion of it unlocks an almost finished Shiranui core alongside the Secret Pack ""Fires of This World and The Next"", which allows you to potentially craft the remaining Shiranui monsters and two of the best Zombie support monsters, <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> and <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>. The only mandatory UR in this build is at least one copy of both <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a> as your main boss monster, <a data-name=""Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy"">Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</a>, and <a data-name=""Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</a>, your alternate win condition who's also a semi-floodgate. All of the SR Shiranui monsters are already unlocked for free upon completion, and the Eldlich core can easily be obtainable as well in the Secret Pack ""Immortal Royalty"" which allows you to also potentially pull <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>. <a data-name=""Book of Life"">Book of Life</a> being just a Rare card as well as Plaguespreader Zombie being a Normal card only actually surprised me in a good way. Other Zombie-type monster supports such as <a data-name=""Revived King Ha Des"">Revived King Ha Des</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Archfiend Zombie-Skull"">Archfiend Zombie-Skull</a> are also either Rare or Normal only. <a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a> is not exactly mandatory, but it would also be nice to have as a Link 2 for Zombie decks.  So yeah, a pretty straightforward list this time and not much crazy or spicy techs. Just an almost free deck to play, I'd say that you can mess around and have fun with."

The other powerful monsters and spell/traps like Erebus, Ehther, Kuraz ,Stormforth and Escalation are for controlling the field. Kuraz is also a great draw power.  The draw power's of the deck are : Pantheism (one of the best searchers also), Kuraz and Reload .  And the last but not least are the searchers : Tenacity, Return (pop it with Kuraz for + 2), Pantheism and Goods (when you send pantheism)  This build doesn't play playset Edea and Eidos (they can be easily negated), Anchamoufrite can be very problematic with your strategy, because he can be stucked in Extra and that will nullify your Domain. Proof of Pruflas also can prevent your Ehther to resolve her effect. Your best solutions to play in their places are : 3x Vishuda (synergy with Prime Monarch) or 3x Linkslayer (Twin Twisters on legs). For tribute fathers my scheme is : 1x Edea, 1x Eidos, 3x Mithra , 3x Linkslayer and of course 1x The Prime Monarch. I find it as perfectly balanced.  Foolish Burial is mostly for Erebus and Edea. Erebus is for the Monster Reincarnation effect and Edea is for Monarch spell/trap recovery.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Ohm is a stronger Cannon Soldier in this deck and is probably the most underrated card in the game.  This ftk is disturbingly consistent and almost 100% without removal. From my experience, it has about an 85% rate to ftk when your opponent opens with a handtrap that negates monster effects but it is easy to bait out if you go into xyz monsters with the Dangers!.  I also added only 1 Dark Room of Nightmare in the main and 2 in the side deck because you can get to it very easily but not always but is also kind of a win more card and doesn't always matter  Give this deck a fair chance and you will get a lot of wins."

Nothing will go wrong, right?""               -Ronald Reagan probably","Well, Thunder Dragon Colossus is limited on the banlist, so Thunder Dragons suddenly became more than just a rogue strategy.  Anyways, this is a Thunder Dragon Chaos deck. We're playing to turbo out Colossus and hopefully Titan on your first turn of play (which is surprisingly easy!)  Our Thunder Dragon lineup is 3 of the OG, 3 Dragondark, 3 Dragonmatrix, 2 Dragon Fusion, 2 Dragonroar, 1 Dragonhawk, and 1 Dragonduo. The newest Main Deck Thunder Dragons gain bonus effects when banished or sent from the field to the graveyard, like special summon a TD monster from the deck, tutor for a TD card (not monster, any card. Hooray for TD Fusion tutor!), getting another copy of the same card, etc. This is why we're also running a small Chaos package!  Our Chaos lineup is pretty brief; 3 Chaos Space, 1 Chaos Creator, 1 Wyverburster, 1 Collapserpent, and the Dragonduo from the TD lineup. We run these to banish TD monsters for value, and in the case with Dragonduo and Chaos Creator being Thunder-type monsters that are special summons from banishing, we can tribute them to cheat Colossus from the Extra Deck.  We include 2 monsters that aren't a part of these packages, but they banish so they're damn good. Batteryman Solar is a Thunder monster that allows you to banish a Thunder monster from the deck, and Aloof Lupine serves the same purpose as long as we banish a Thunder monster from our hand. Cheating TD monster effects from straight from the Main Deck is pretty bonkers.  I included 3 different Hand Traps into the deck; 3 Effect Veiler, 3 Maxx ""C"" and 2 Called by the Grave. These can honestly be anything. Just prepare for what you're primarily playing against to tech against that matchup. Drytrons? Droll and Lock Bird fucks with their turn massively.  Our spell lineup now, excluding ones previously mentioned. 1 Feather Duster, 1 Gold Sarc, 1 Instant Fusion, and 3 Allure of Darkness. Feather Duster ruins backrow decks like Eldlich, Generaider, and a good Monarch start. The Gold Sarc is an immediate effect activation for a TD monster of our choice, and the 3 Allure of Darkness is for draw power while fueling effects from our TD monsters with its banish clause.  Now the spicy shit: the Extra Deck! Most of the Extra Deck is generic and you can swap most of it out with your personal preferences.  We got 1 Colossus, 3 Titan, 1 Kaminari Attack, 1 Abyss Dweller, 1 Summer Summoner, 1 Masquerena, 1 Verte, 1 Phoenix, 1 Unicorn, 1 Apollousa, and 1 Accesscode.  Trust me when I say that all you really need in your extra deck is the Colossus, Kaminari Attack, and 2 Titans and not 3. Colossus, if you didn't know, floodgates ONLY your opponent from not being allowed to search cards from their deck. Note that they can still DRAW cards and send cards to the graveyard. Kaminari Attack is our Instant Fusion target, being a Thunder Fusion monster allows it to be tributed for either Colossus and Titan. Titan has a quick effect pop when a Thunder monster activates their effect from your hand. Please note that on nowhere on that card mentions ""Once per turn"". Oh yeah, and they have protection from destruction. With Colossus, you gotta banish a Thunder monster (More effects? Hell yeah!) and Titan allows you to banish and 2 cards from your graveyard, doesn't have to be just a Thunder monster.  And that's Thunder Dragons for ya! Have fun summoning Colossus and Titan turn 1 and your opponent not being able to do anything!  &nbsp;"

Targets for banishing (most of the time): 1 mechaba, purgatrio, augoeidis, predaplant verde, framelord omega, Construct, fossil warrior.  Some of u will wondering why i play 2 ash and 2 droll, the reason is simple, i love these cards and i know they are the best hand traps in the current meta but if i have 2 ash in hand then one becomes brick and can't be used the same turn, same goes for droll, hand traps that can be used once per turn i playing x2 in main and if is devastating against some decks i have the third copy in side.  The side deck is build for the current meta, i didn't put any spell/trap removals, however, going first solemn judgment can respond. If u want u can replace droplet with lightning storm or spell/trap removal or board breaker.  in the main is 12 hand traps, 85% chance to open going first and 92% going second, if u want to change something feel free to do it but make sure to have at least 7-8 monster hand traps that can be appropiate targets for Small World and are compatible for almiraj (because of Maximus combo). The players which want 3 ash blosom feel free to do it but don't remove ghost ogre, u need at least 1.  SMALL WORLD: How small world works in this deck? Some of u maybe never played this card so i will explain. Banish 1 monster from your hand. To add Aleister in hand: reveal from the deck 1 of these: Ash, Veiller, Maximus, Droll, Ghost ogre To add dogmatika in hand: reveal from the deck 1 of these: Ghost ogre, droll, Aleister  About Maximus: Everyone using 1 copy of maximus (me also in the past) but that's wrong, Maximus x3 is the best. Normal summon whatever monster (even hand trap), summon almiraj - gardna - sp summon maximus - send in gy apcalone and ash dragon - set schism for winda - sp summon ecclesia in EP by ash dragon and add fleur in your hand. I mention that combo because the most of the people thinks Maximus is brick or bad draw, but is not. It's both starter and extender.  BUDGET VERSION: Remove 3 pot of prosperity. This is very strong card, going first it can give u access in total of 11 cards in 40 card deck, i consider pot of prosperity both starter and card for consistency, u can't replace it with upstart goblin or pot of desire, absurd, no chance. Add 1-3 mystic mine in the place of pot of prosperity, the reason is simple, if u don't have starter in your hand u can lock and stop your opponent from playing until u draw meltdown, u have 4 meltdown in main so u will be fine, this is your best option if u don't play pot of prosperity in this deck. Remove Droplet also. I don't recommend removing the destiny fusion package because if aleister and dogmatika is negated then u can summon predaplant verte and summon enforcer, basically after 2 negates u still can play, so really i don't recommend removing it, if u want u can replace it with dragoon package, 1 fusion, 1 dark magician and 1 red eyes... total of 3 cards, still is 100 dolars but enforcer or dragoon is worth it, u can target impermanence for replacement, this will save u the money for enforcer or dragoon. if u choice the dragoon package and u have 1-2 card free space, u can add Angel Statue - Azurune, it's good and is combaining well with all your engines."

This deck was a versatile Anti-Meta Beatdown deck, which is described as a Beatdown deck that utilizes different control tools. This deck utilized the monster Elemental HERO Neos Alius in tandem with the card Gemini Spark to act as removal. Combining these with the card Skill Drain, allowed you to play a slower Beatdown strategy by stopping all monster effects on the field. This deck didn't utilize many monster card effects to ensure its win, so it could get away with and play around a floodgate like Skill Drain.  Neos Alius is your primary monster to beat down the opponent with, its 1900 ATK body was very capable of punching over most normal summoned monsters, while this together with Gemini Spark can help clear the opponent's board, the other important factor is that it's an Elemental HERO, meaning that it was capable of being used as fusion material for a generic line of Elemental HERO fusion monsters. With Miracle Fusion, you can use monsters on your field and/or in your grave yard as material for a fusion summon of an Elemental HERO fusion monster.  The Extra Deck acts sort of as a tool box, allowing you to get out monsters that you need for certain situations. In most cases, the deck would use Neos Alius with either Penguin Soldier or Snowman Eater to make Elemental HERO Absolute Zero. Absolute Zero while on top of having a fairly decent ATK of 2500, it also has an effect that destroys all of your opponent's monsters when removed from the field. Because Absolute Zero's effect activates after it leaves the field, it will still work even with Skill Drain active on the field, because Absolute Zero is no longer on the field, it is no longer negated by Skill Drain. Elemental HERO The Shining is a really good card to beat over larger monsters on your opponent's field. By using the Miracle Fusion to summon it, you will have banished at least 1 Elemental HERO monster, so it at the least be summoned out with 2900 ATK. On top of this, it also has an effect when sent from the field to the grave yard that lets you add up to 2 banished Elemental HEROs to your hand, allowing you to recycle the material used to summon it. Elemental HERO Great Tornado is a fairly strong monster, halving the ATK and DEF of all face-up monsters your opponent controls, on top of having 2800 ATK points, it was able to punch over practically any monster. Elemental HERO Nova Master is a decent card, having 2600 ATK on top of also letting you draw a card when it destroyed a monster is a good recovery option for the deck, being able to be made from the Wind-Up Zenmaines and one of your Elemenal HEROs. Elemental HERO Gaia is just another option to go into to beat over large monsters, being able to siphon half the attack out of a monster lets you punch in for a considerable amount of damage. That's as far as it goes with the Elemental HERO line-up for the Extra Deck. The Elemental HERO fusions are essentially your primary tools to use to deal adequate damage and combat stronger monsters. On top of all of this as well, the deck utilizes Super Polymerization, so you're able to use your opponent's monsters to fuse as well, so it makes for a really good removal tool.  From here I'll go over certain key cards in the deck. Elemental HERO Stratos will either act as a tool to remove your opponent's Spells and Traps, or it can be used to search out your Neos Alius to play on the follow-up turn. Stratos on top of E - Emergency Call, as well as 1 Reinforcement of the Army, allows you to effectively play 7 copies of your Neos Alius, which helps keep the deck really consistent.  You Play Pot of Duality for this reason, your deck isn't going to be doing a lot of special summoning all the time. Pot of Duality lets you dig into your deck for your turn. Whether that be drawing a Gemini Spark, a Neos Alius, or even one of your Trap cards, Pot of Duality lets you get the cards that will get your strategy online.  Thunder King Rai-Oh stops the opponent from searching for cards in their deck, and it can also negate a single special summon. This is a pretty decent card to normal summon, as its 1900 ATK points can be hard to hit over in a good amount of circumstances.  Crusader of Endymion is played mostly because it's another Gemini monster with a comparable 1900 ATK points. It doesn't enable your fusions like Neos Alius, but it does give your more consistency in getting your Gemini Spark online.  Beast King Barbaros can be normal summoned, but its attack is changed to 1900, this card works well with Skill Drain, as Skill Drain with negate its effect, and it will return to its original 3000 ATK. This can be utilized in a couple ways. Either by using it as a big monster to clear the opponent's field, or to possibly have your opponent attack into it, and then activate the Skill Drain so Barbaros could potential destroy that monster.  As mentioned above, Gemini Spark acts as a control tool for the deck, allowing you to turn your Neos Alius and your Crusader of Endymion into removal options, and then Gemini Spark lets you draw a card. Combined with the card Hero Blast, Gemini Spark became much more powerful, allowing you tribute the Neos Alius to destroy a card on the field, and then Hero Blast would let you bring back the Neos Alius to your hand and destroy a monster on the field. This is a very power card combination that acts as the primary control tools for the deck, as it can easily remove valuable cards from your opponent's field.  I hope you enjoy this little piece of Yu-Gi-Oh!'s history. This deck is really fun, and I hope you guys will think so too."
