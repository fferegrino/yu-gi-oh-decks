I think its biggest strength over Zoolitch was and is the OTK potential and not necessarily access to ZEXAL . The deck lost the ability to consistently stun/stall with ZEXAL but now has more options and ways to disrupt the opponents plays.

I won the first week with it. I hope to contribute to some sort of resource for similarly-minded people with this since deckbuilding with almost no playables is... unexpectedly challenging. You struggle to fill in the remaining spots very quickly. I hope to provide a few guidelines and am open for criticism to improve in the future.  The concept of the deck is fairly simple: Sit behind 2k defenders or try to establish a board presence with Witty Phantom, Trial of Nightmare Uraby or Skull Red Bird. Eventually, go into your tributed guys + proper field spell and dominate from there.  Yami and Sogen are of utmost importance for this. Yami lets Trial Of Nightmare go toe-to-toe with Uraby, the second strongest non-tribute beater of the format. Witty Phantom surpasses Skull Red Bird, the strongest beatstick without tribute requirement. My 2k defenders also don't mind the additional def (with the exception of Spirit of the Harp who unfortunately falls into Curse of Dragon range under Yami). Similary, Beaver Warrior is safe from any non-tribute beater under Sogen. Gaia at least trades with Dark Magician with it.  My ""payoffs"" are Two-Pronged attack (going minus two to out a two-tribute monster is surprisingly decent as it re-establishes the advantageous position you previously had just by spamming 2k defenders; the momentum swing from any two-tribute summon is huge), Gaia the Fierce Knight (my best two-tribute guy) and Succubus Knight. I used the last purely because it had incidental synergy with Sogen and my one equip spell. She actually came in clutch in the finals since I established her with the blade and Sogen.  Dark Hole, and Stop Defense are power staples to destroy card advantage from the opponent. Hane-Hane punishes tributes. Swords is pretty nice if you draw any of the monsters not mentioned so far since those are just filler slots that can only secure you the driver's seat with luck.  Mountain is sort of a win more card: It lets Curse of Dragon go over 2k defenders but can snowball negatively if that one falls. Boosting Skull Red Bird is pretty devastating if your deck usually relies on field boosts to withstand it or go over the red menace.  The extra deck is just filler stuff I pulled to trick people into believing I would be stupid enough to run Poly at this stage of the game.  No side deck since even getting to forty cards was enough of a struggle already. Dragon Capture Jar would have been a possible candidate had I pulled it, though.  Things to note: There is no Trap Hole in our format so far, which made tribute summons so much better in theory. Two-pronged attack was, thankfully, largely dismissed by my friends. Don't commit the same mistake in your Prog decks; losing card advantage in favor of board presence isn't that bad if 90% of your cards suck!"

Set up your board on your opponents turn.,"(Go First) Control and Locking down your opponent is the name of the game. You can summon and lock out your opponent from doing basically everything, You can set up your board on your players turn you will want to make sure you have a Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, Send The Trap card Destruction Swordsman Memories into the grave when activating Prologue and if you didnt draw that, Hopefully you drew a Buster Whelp and use buster whelp to get Prologue. link away Welp for Linkuribo and then chain a dogmatika to the Linkuribo. If you use Nadier Servant or Eclacia send Titinklad The Ash Dragon to the grave then you can trigger Memories in the grave and use the Ash Dragon and a Buster Blader as Fusion material (this will trigger on your opponent's turn) and activate the Trap Prologue and you will summon Buster Dragon and Buster Blader the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman. This will cause all your opponent's monsters to become dragons and the fusion will cause all dragons they own to be switched to defense and cant activate their effects. You can attack with you Fusion Buster Blader to a defence position monster  and inflict piercing damage and if your Fusion Buster didn't attack make The Link, (using buster dragon) protector welp of destruction swordsman. and in the endphase they will take burn damage of the attk of the Dragon Destroyer that didn't attack because it can only attack if theirs a monster on their side of the field. Also use buster welp to search other Dragon Buster cards to equip to a buster blader so your basically able to make your opponent to essentially not be able to even play. And all else fails theirs always Dragoon. if your faced with a dragoon on turn one you can out Dragoon with Fallen of Albaz and use it as a super polly for starving venom fusion dragon."

Then I realized that they’re actually really good in some ways.  Treat and Frost provides graveyard utility and fixes the negate problems that the twins have (where they just die to one ash)  Plus frost is an aqua so she can help make toadally awesome and treat is a dark so she can help make number 65. Both negates  So I took a control spin with knightmare for this deck and it works like a charm!

You've been warned.,"If you been around Youtube, you've probably heard of Cimoooooooo's Yu-Gi-Oh Progression series. I decided to try this out as a deck build exercise. I will be doing the prize wheel, but a little bit different. I will be including Gold Series and Reprint sets alongside the Tournament Packs. Why? Because why not. Also, I will be using the custom wheel from wheel-of-yugioh.com to determine what prize I'll add to the deck.

Easy to understand.  Can disrupt your opponent.  &nbsp;  If perfect hand on turn 1, can pull out a very frustrating board. (Borreload, Super Poly, Magistus equipped with Vahram, Toadally Awesome and Secret Village of Spellcrafter.)  &nbsp;  If playing Secret Village of Spellcaster. Leaving 1 Performage Trick Clown can be very hard to take out, and can win if your opponent relied heavily on spell to get combo going and do not have card to out the Village.  &nbsp;  This deck can be change to pure Magistus by adding Magistus Theurgy and removing Super Polymerization then more handtraps. (I based(copy lol) this deck from youtuber that I forget his name. Sorry sir! I really want to credit you.)  &nbsp;  This deck is not good at recovery and it is hard to find cards that will help it. So be careful about your play. Try to control the board.  &nbsp;  I hate GY effect. It should be exclusive to Zombie.  &nbsp;  <strong>Sadly, without my Waifu, Silent Magician.</strong>"

I have played this build at locals and I cant complain I feel with the dogmatika engine it has more consistentcy and does exactly what I planned to do.

Anyway, here's a Salamangreat deck using a a Live Twin engine. Credit to Rondasrich for making a deck similar to this for the inspiration. The Live Twins can get out a ton of bodies easily, 3 at once if you have the best possible hand, making it a great engine for link climbing. The Salads do usual Salad shit; summon monsters, search, set up backrow etc etc. I'm not gonna go into detail about Salads, everyone knows Salads. overall, the deck is pretty consistent, and can make a strong board of Accescode and Abyss Dweller."

However, before the release of the SD, Ice Barriers lacked field prescence and swarming capabilities that could ease the summon of their Extra Deck monsters or maintain their lockdown effects, since most required another Ice Barrier on the field.  Freezing Chains introduced cards that aid the swarming aspect and a new boss monster and some sort of recycling and protection:  Revealer: Can discard one card to SS an Ice Barrier Tuner from the Deck, but locks on only SS WATER monsters for the turn. If an Ice Barrier monster would require a discard to activate their effects <em>(ej. Revealer, Brionac or Gungnir)</em>, it can banish itself from the GY as one of those cards. Her lockdown effect prevents your opponent to Tribute Summon. <em>(One of the main playmakers)</em>  Speaker: Can SS from the hand if you control an Ice Barrier monster. Also, if you control an Ice Barrier monster, it can banish from the GY to SS a level 1 token. Her lockdown effect prevents Defense Position monsters to change battle position. <em>(Free material for summons)</em>  General Wayne: Can SS from the hand if you control an Ice Barrier monster and your opponent controls a monster. Searchs and Ice Barrier S/T on summon. His lockdown effect doesn't require another Ice Barrier monsters and banishes any S/T sent to your opponent's GY while on the field. <em>(Preffered targets are Medallion or Freezing Chains, their new Spell)</em>  Zuijin: Can SS from the GY by lowering 2 levels from a face-up WATER mosnter on your field, but it banishes if it leaves the field. Can Tribute itself to SS a level 5 or higher Ice Barrier monster from your hand. Doesn't have a lockdown effect. <em>(Can help as tribute or Synchro fodder)</em>  Hexa Spirit: Can mill a level 3 or lower Ice Barrier monster to copy its level for the rest of the turn. Reduces by 500 the ATK/DEF of your opponent's monsters while another Ice Barrier is on the field. <em>(Main Tuner and Revealer's preffered target)</em>  Winds over the Ice Barrier: Can tribute any number of Ice Barrier monsters on the field to SS the same number of level 4 or lower Ice Barrier monsters from the Deck. Can banish from the GY to add a Ice Barrier that is banished or in your GY to your hand. <em>(Deck Summoner and recycler)</em>  Freezing Chains: A Continuous Spell that works as an archetypal World Legacy Guardragon, SS any level 4 or lower Ice Barrier monster from your GY. If you control 3 or more Ice Barrier monsters, all of them are unaffected to your opponent's activated monster effects if they were SS from the Extra Deck. <em>(GY summoner and effect protection)</em>  Terror of Trishula: A Trap card that can copy OG Trishula's effects depending on the number of Ice Barrier Synchro monsters on your field. While on the GY, can banish itself to negate an effect that target any Ice Barrier Synchro monster. <em>(Although requires setup, is fairly strong)</em>  Trishula, Zero Dragon: A generic, level 11, three-material Synchro monster that can banish up to 3 cards on your opponent's field, without targeting. If destroyed by any mean, floats into the OG Trishula from the Extra Deck or GY, makes its ATK 3300, negates the effects of all your opponents monsters currently on his field and halves its attack. <em>(Very powerful boss monster that can punish harder if not removed carefully)</em>  The Side Deck on this list works to show examples of cards that can be used as tech choices, whether they are in the SD or not. Some of them help to add certain lockdown effects depending the matchup or removal (Dai-Sojo, Spellbreaker and Dance Princess), extenders (Deep Sea Diva &amp; Prima Donna, Halqifibrax &amp; Quandax, Coral Anemone, Moray of Greed, Surface and Magellanica) and strong removal or effect negation (Quariongandax, White Aura Whale, Risen Dragite and Fiendish Chain just since can be recycled by Dewloren if not destroyed)"

Magicians' Souls - If you have a bad hand, it can help you, just don't discard other good cards. 2. Spellbook of Secrets/Spellbook Magician of Prophecy - Basic spellbook combo starters. Put them together bc they have basically the same effect(Add 1 Spellbook card from deck) 3. Nadir Servant - It has dogmatika... No surprises here.</li>  	<li>Counter decks: 1.  Zombie World - They can just turn your spellcasters into zombie... Which makes you cannot play. Against it, I recommend just having luck of drawing 2 cards to knightmare, and play normally(And have a bait to Doomking)... 2. Ice Barriers - Yep... I'm not trolling. 1 card in Ice Barriers(Spellbreaker of Ice Barrier, to be exact) can lock all your deck, making that you cannot play. You can use dogmatika engine against it, but without spells it's very hard to pull something out. 3. Altergeist, Traptrix or any trap-based deck - They probably have Imperial Order in main/side deck. Which again, no spells = no playing.</li>  	<li>Side: 1. Basic Handtraps - Since my deck is not maining it, I put in side, in case of something happen. 2. Lightning Storm - Well, it's a spell, it's good. You can replace it with Raigeki or Harpie's Feather Duster. They do the same in a duel. 3. Pots - In Spellbook decks, pots are a good drawing card, but because we are using a Dogmatika engine, I don't recommend it. You could use it and comment if it was good. 4. Solemns - Again, normally mained in Spellbook decks, but I sided it, because of Dogmatika.  You can probably use it if you optimize more this set. 5. Triple Tactical Talents/ Mind Control/ Called by the Grave/ Monster Reborn - Those are cards that you can change to the ones you prefer. They normally never go to main, but can be used against some decks. If you're gonna use Triple Tactical Talents, I recommend only using 1.</li> </ul> I've not played this deck enough to know the decks this deck is strong, but if you can put a good field, you can counter many decks. Sorry if this is not that much of an info, but if I can help, that's enough."

Based on real-life Carnivorous plants and insects Traptrix are an archetype that utilise trap cards, in particular the trap-hole cards to generate advantage and control the flow of the game to deadly effect with the most important member being Traptrix Sera. Tho the traphole cards have long existed in the game it wasn't until 2013 with the release of Myermole and Dionea did the archtype as we know it come into existence Culminating with the release of Sera and Allomerus in late 2018 finally allowing the deck to stand on its own. </span></p> <span>There are now multiple varients of Traptrix some of which have enjoyed success including Dogmatika which is the most well known as well as Paleo, Pure and Zoo! But what I'm showcasing today is my take on the artifact build which not only seeks to deny oppenents use of the extra deck but help overcome the decks reliance on going first by utilising super poly to compliment the Build. </span>  <span>  <strong>Why Artifacts?</strong> Artifacts have a long history with traptrix and thanks to sanctum and Dagda can continue to work alongside each-other annoying players everywhere. Artifacts bring multiple tools to the table, Primarily locking out your oppenents extradeck but also punishing your oppenents for destroying precious backrow and bring out bodies to aid the decks snowball potential. As an example Your oppenent MSTs Sanctum while haveing 2 monsters, You Chain and Summon Moraltach. When it resolve Moraltach and sanctums In grave effect trigger and now you can take out your oppenents 2 monsters while possessing a body. Dagda can force your opponents into awkward styles of play to dodge additional artifact summons and if you hard draw them just set them and laugh when your opponent drops duster. You could simply just wait for your opponent to waste there normal and then activate sanctum to use scythe. </span>  <span>All This helps protect the Vital Backrow and often proc Sera</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Why Super Polymerisation? </span></strong><span>Assuming your not buster, domain or Spell locked is traptrix's get out of jail card helping us go 2nd where cards like DRNM, Kaijus, Droplets or Dark Hole/Raigeki cant since unless we open perfectly lack the tools to exploit those. Additionally it doesn't hinder the deck going first since it can double as an interupt something other blow-out save for Set Torrential Tribute or Evenly if you survive cant do. It does this while giving <em>your deck another body</em> again reducing another problem traptix face, Lack of Bodies an opportunities to snowball. Only nibiru is really comparable and that be played around. </span>  <span>Simply Super poly with only a few extra deck slots helps Traptrix immensely and compliments the artifact part of the deck by punishing usage of the extra</span>  <span> <strong>Card Choice explanation and guide: </strong>The Deck Obviously centres around Sera so 3 of Each <em>Myrmeleo, Mantis and Dionea</em> are taken as they have effects best compliment her while <em>Parallel Exceed</em> rounds out the monster part of the engine as it almost always equals a free Raffleslia, Knightmare or Allomerus depending on the scenerio for further extension. One Of each Artifact <em>Moraltach</em> and <em>Scythe</em> are mained as you only  need a turn of extra-deck lockdown to win and multiple can be garnets. Moraltach is complimentry. <em>Ash Blossom</em> and <em>Phantasmy</em> are my handtraps of Choice with the latter Shuffling back Hard Drawn Scythes and digging for Super-poly  <em>Monster Reborn</em> and Triple <em>Super Polymerisation</em> are the decks only spells with Super poly being the more important. Due to being quick-play its usable first or 2nd and compliments Traptrix unlike other blow out cards since it can be set as an interupt or to remove problems going 2nd. The amount of time this card has gotten me wins is uncountable.  We Finally come to the Traps With the Standard<em> Triple Floodgate, One Bottemless and One Gravediggers trapholes </em>as they offer the most versatility with minimum space taken up but lets face it, floodgate is just the most trollish. <em>Phantom Knights Shade Brigidane</em> is also a 3 off as it in conjunction with sera can generate a +2 that can then be lead into Time Thief Redeor or another Extra deck Monster. Artifact Sanctum Triggers Scythe and Moraltach and if your oppenents destroy the card you get to blow up one. Trap Trick seaerchs a trap while 3 Dinomiscus, 2 Icy Dragons Prison and a lone Lost Wind round out the deck Offering banishment and resource recursion. </span>  <span><em><strong>2 Sera</strong> </em>is mandatory as shes the entire foundation Traptrix are built on. You lose your first, You have a spare. Always take atleast 2. Afterwards one of each <em>Rafflesia and Allomerus</em> are taken with the former offering a defence and the latter offensive comboing with Dionea and Myrmeleo to climb into knightmares of which you have 1 of each of the standard <em>Cerebus, Phoenix and Unicorn. </em><em>Artifact Dagda</em> rounds out the artifact Lineup Offering additional chances to re-use artifacts. <em>Borrelsword</em> is the decks win-con and Oh-crap moment card and thanks to allomerus and Sera you would be surprised how easy it is to summon. <em>Abyss Dweller, Daigusto Emeral</em> and <em>Time Thief Redoer</em> round out the XYZs. <em>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</em> and <em>Mudragon of the Swamp</em> Are the primary super poly targets with <em>Earth Golem</em> being in my build solely because my meta has a few salad players but could easily be swapped for gravity Controller or Grypon if the player wished as they open up chances to recycle cards.</span>  <span> <strong>The Sidedeck:</strong> Pretty much dependant on the meta but <em>Torrential Tribute</em> should always be somewhere in a traptrix deck alongside the standard Imperial Order, Mind Control and Prankertops. Afterwards its a matter of Choice. I run 3 <em>Artifact lancea</em> to hurt decks reliant on banishment and it works with sanctum. <em>Gryphon and Bagooska</em> give me extra deck alternative to super poly targets if I'm forced to side it out. with <em>Anti-spell Fragerence</em> and <em>Nibiru</em> finishing out the deck. </span>  <span> <strong>Basic Plays for those interested in traptrix otherwise skip to decklist: </strong></span> <ul>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Normal Mantis or Myrmeleo preferable and Search Otherwise any traptrix is fine &gt; Link into sera and set any traps</span></p> </li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Do as above &gt; Set Shade Brigidane and immediately activate &gt; Trigger Sera and Summon Myrmeleo &gt; Activate Myrmeleo and resolve, Activate Sera and Set a Traphole Direct From Deck &gt; Either Link for Dagda or XYZ into Rafflesia, Abyss dweller, Time Thief or any Rank 4</span></p> </li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Do First Play &gt; Activate Parallel Exceed &gt; Summon Rank 4 </span></p> </li>  	<li><span>Activate Super Poly, Then do Stuff</span></li>  	<li> <p class=""western"" style=""text-align: LEFT;""><span>Summon Knightmare while Sera is presnt and ensure Co-link.

The main monster you want to focus on is Guardian Angel Joan who will be a ""boss monster"" of some sorts, the main 2 ways to get them out is Tribute Burial and Apprentice Piper. Once you have summoned Guardian Angel Joan the next part of the strategy comes into play, use as many equip spells to raise their ATK to a really high number (preferably 3 United We Stand and either 2 Axe of Despair or Mage Power). This will allow you to destroy nearly any monster your opponent summons and gain A LOT of LP. Most of the cards in the Extra Deck are for when you are in a pinch and have no other choice.

Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army: </strong>Nos da cualquier guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Envía a Cloak o Boots para traer a este último o a Brigandine respectivamente.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>  	<li>El deck protege el paso final con Apollousa, sólo por si acaso.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que le afectan los incrementos de LP del oponente, aunque sólo si ocurren luego del efecto de Chaos Atlandis.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

Our cool and epic Ritual friends that had quite the spotlight in the meta, and will return once Lightning Overdrive releases! I remember being hyped for them since the first leak, and being super excited that it would be my first Ritual deck.  New to this archetype? Want to understand some tricks and combos with this deck? Let me explain how my build works, starting with a brief description of what each card does!  LEGEND: PSY-Frame Driver will be in <span>NEON GREEN</span> (he is special, like my homie PSY-Frame Pepega) Effect Monster names will be in <span>ORANGE</span> Ritual Monster names will be in <span>BLUE</span> Spell card names will be in <span>GREEN</span> Trap card names will be in <span>PINK</span> Extra Deck Monster names will be in <span>RED</span>  Let's start with the Drytrons!  Drytron Monsters:  <span>Drytron Alpha Thuban</span>- The Ritual Monster searcher. Shares MVP status with <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span> and <span>Zeta-Aldhibah</span>. <span>Drytron Beta Rastaban</span>- The GY Returner. Only one-of because he won't be used as much. <span>Drytron Delta Altais</span>- The Draw card. Helps with the deck's lack of draw cards. <span>Drytron Gamma Eltanin</span>- The Reinforcement-caller. He will greatly aid in gathering material for a Ritual Summon. <span>Drytron Zeta Aldhibah</span>- The Ritual Spell searcher. Will start you off by fetching <span>Meteonis Drytron<span>.</span></span> <span>Drytron Meteonis Draconids</span>- B I G  B O I. If he's Ritual Summoned with a total level of 2 or 1, he can attack all of your opponent's Special Summoned monsters! Can also banish Drytrons from the GY whose ATK equals 2000 or 4000 to pop your opponent's face-up cards for every 2000 ATK. <span>Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids</span>- S/T destroyer. Untargetable by S/Ts, and has a GY effect that revives 2 Drytrons from the GY to set up for more Ritual Summons, ideally <span>Draconids</span> or <span>Nekroz of Trishula</span>.  Drytron Spells &amp; Trap (Yes, they only have one Trap card, and I personally think it's swag.):  <span>Drytron Fafnir</span>- Retrieves a Drytron S/T upon activation, and protects <span>Meteonis Drytron</span> from negation. Its other effect is supposed to lower your monster lvls so the Drytron Rituals can activate one of their effects, but is hardly used. <span>Drytron Nova</span>- Special Summons a Drytron from your deck, but destroys it at the End Phase. Usually the start of some spectacular plays! <span>Meteonis Drytron</span>- Ritual summons almost any Ritual in the game from your hand or GY! It also has a GY effect that, by having a Drytron lose 1000 ATK for a little, puts itself back in your hand! <span>Drytron Meteor Shower</span>- Bounces your opponent's Normal/Special summoned monster back into the deck if you control a Ritual (once-per-turn). Technically, this card can be used in ANY Ritual deck, since you only need a Ritual on your field.  Now for the other useful cards/staples! Some of these cards help the deck's consistency, and some are meant as means to counter your opponent.  Let's jump into the Monsters!  <span>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span>- Speaks for herself. For new players, this card says ""No!! &gt;:( "" to your opponent's search, sending from deck to GY, or Special Summon from the deck. <span>Vanity's Ruler</span>- While on the field, prevents the opponent from Special Summoning. <span>Relinquished</span>- YOINKS an opponent's monster, equips it to itself, and gains ATK/DEF based on that monster. Your opponent also takes the same damage as you from attacks with it, and can destroy it's equip for protection. <span>Cyber Angel Natasha</span>- Her LP-gain is really neat, but that's not why she's here. Her attack negation effect is non-OPT, so she can stall while you gather resources. Her third effect, however, steals an opponent's monster and Special Summons herself from the GY by banishing another Cyber Angel! <span>Cyber Angel Benten</span>- Newly Limited because of an abusable non-OPT effect. You won't use her first effect a lot, but her second effect searches another LIGHT Fairy. Usually your search target will be <span>Vanity</span>. <span>Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</span>- Ritual Hand-trap! Discard effect negates the activation of a card that targets a monster you control. Second effect, if it's on the field, bounces itself to negate and banish an opponent's Special Summon. <span>Nekroz of Trishula</span>- Once Ritual Summoned, banishes 1 card each from your opponent's hand, field, and GY! (Non-targeting, btw). It's discard effect will come in handy if you swap <span>Nekroz of Unicore</span> from the Side Deck.  Take a look at the Spells!  <span>Cyber Emergency</span>- Drytrons and Cyber Dragons share custody of this card. Searches all Drytron monsters. If it's negated, use it's effect to discard a card and add it back to your hand! <span>Foolish Burial</span>- Self-explainatory. Sets up for <span>Meteonis Drytron</span>, <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span>, etc. <span>Preparation of Rites</span>- Level 7 or lower Ritual searcher. If <span>Meteonis Drytron</span> is in the GY, this also lets you recover it for free! <span>Terraforming</span>- Searches <span>Drytron Fafnir</span>. <span>Called by the Grave</span>- Hand-Trap counter. (In my opinion, should come off the banlist) <span>Relinquished Fusion</span>- Fusion Summons <span>Millennium-Eyes Restrict</span> by banishing <span>Relinquished</span> and an effect monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. Its GY effect lets you equip an effect monster your opponent controls to <span>Millennium-Eyes</span>.  The Extra Deck! This is going to be the confusing part. There isn't any go-to strategy with what's in here, especially with Mu-Beta-Fafnir coming later. I will be explaining some plays you can pull off with each member, but how you start is up to you.  <span>Millennium-Eyes Restrict</span>- Can equip a monster from your opponent's GY to itself when they activate a monster effect. Once equipped, your opponent cannot attack with/activate cards with the same name! <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span>- This baby's got 3 things going on: One, acts as a slightly different Macro Cosmos, banishing cards sent from the Hand/Deck to the GY. Two, can tribute itself to negate &amp; destroy a Spell/Trap/Monster Effect activation. Three, adds a Ritual Monster OR Spell if it's sent to the GY! <span>Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</span>- Can attack directly and material for <span>AA-ZEUS</span>. The more materials used to Xyz summon it, the more ATK and attacks it gains! <span>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</span>- FIELD NUKE. <span>Linkuriboh</span>- He's vibing. Changes an opponent's attacking monster's ATK to 0 and recurring Link material <span>Relinquished Anima</span>- Steals a monster it points to and gains ATK based on the monster it yoinked. <span>Geonator Transverser</span>- Protects what it points to from your opponent's card effects, and can switch control of what it points to. <span>Herald of the Mirage Lights</span>- Its negation effect will be more useful in a different build, but it's second will be useful in this one. If it's sent to the GY by an opponent's card, it searches up to 2 Ritual monsters/spells with different names. <span>I:P Masquerena</span>- Link-2 that protects whatever Link monster that uses it as material from destruction effects. <span>Knightmare Unicorn</span>- Generic Link-3 that bounces an opponent's card to the deck. <span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</span>- Generic Link-4 that helps with negation. <span>Borrelsword Dragon</span>- Angy. Will help clean up game.  Last stop on our tour through this deck is the Side Deck! This is my first Side, as I never had one for ANY of my other decks. I figured that if I want to use this deck in a Tournament, I should find out how to put one together. ALTHOUGH, I believe that you (yes, you! the one with the amazing face!) should be in charge of what the Side looks like. You can follow what mine looks like, or make one that's more suited to your dueling needs.  That aSIDE, let's jump in!  <span>PSY-Frame Driver</span>- Needed in order to use <span>Gamma</span>. Useful as Link Material. <span>PSY-Framegear Gamma</span>- Another handtrap. Negates an opponent's Monster effect if you have no monsters, and very useful going second. Can be used as Link material alongside Gamma, but can also be used to Synchro <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span> (with the help of two Drytrons. <span>Gamma Eltanin</span> helps with this). <span>Artifact Lancea</span>- Hand-trap that prevents banishing. <span>Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</span>- Tributes an opponent's pesky monster. <span>Nekroz of Unicore</span>- Negates the effects of your opponent's Extra Deck monsters. <span>Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon</span>- When Special Summoned, bounces your opponent's S/Ts, and your opponent can't activate anything in response! Also, while on the field, forces your opponent to pay 500 LP to activate card effects! <span>Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord</span>- If Ritual Summoned, skips your opponent's MP1. Also negates the effects of Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz monsters. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span>- Beater with DOUBLE Piercing damage and cannot be targeted/destroyed by card effects! <span>Lord of the Red</span>- When a card/effect is activated, he can pop a monster OR a S/T! <span>Cyber Angel Vrash</span>- Extra Deck Scourge. If Ritual Summoned, can destroy as many Extra Deck monsters your opponent controls and, if you do, inflicts 1000 damage for each and, if you do, can make 2 attacks! She also has an effect that can negate an effect &amp; destroy something that would destroy a card by shuffling a Ritual from the GY. <span>Dark Ruler No More</span>- Negates your opponent's monster effects and cannot be responded to!  COOL TIPS!  - One go-to is utilizing <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span> to revive another Drytron to set up for a Ritual or a Link-2. - Summon <span>Sauravis</span>, use it's on-field effect, then you can use it's discard effect in the same turn. - <span>Millennium-Eyes</span> can target &amp; equip Hand-traps in your opponent's GY, preventing your opponent from activating ones with the same name. - After summoning <span>Nightingale</span>, attack as much as you can before summoning <span>AA-ZEUS</span>. - <span>Relinquished Anima</span> can steal the <span>Jizukiru</span> summoned to the opponent's field, becoming free removal and free beater. - <span>I:P</span>, in tandem with <span>Gamma-Eltanin</span>, can bring out <span>Apollousa</span> or <span>Borrelsword</span> during your opponent's turn. - <span>Odd-Eyes</span> is helpful with your opponent's combos, as they have to keep lowering their LP to get where they want, and helps set up for a swift finish with <span>Chaos MAX</span> or any big body. - Combine <span>Unicore</span> with <span>Amorphactor</span> to hamper your opponent's Extra Deck monsters further.  Thank you for your time and interest!"

It's got some very explosive effects that are kept in line with some very harsh xenolocks. It's a very unique playstyle for a pendulum deck that can out grind almost anything if you can force the game into such a state.  The deck is intended to be able to go first or second but is better off going second in order to make use of Abyss Actor - Comic Relief, which is one of the most effective tools the deck has.  DECK SIZE: I recommend running between 43-50 cards in your deck when playing Abyss Actors. This is because you want to reduce the chances of opening too many of the Abyss Scripts in your deck, you can also start generating advantage with any abyss actor and any pendulum monster so the extra cards don't result in brick often; however, I wouldn't go beyond 50 as the deck sometimes struggles going first if the opponent has a blowout response on the second turn.  ABYSS ACTORS: All the 3-of Abyss actors are cards that are going to be your main combo pieces that you will use nearly every duel. the 2-ofs are also extremely good but you often do not need multiples. the one-ofs are niche, but you need them in order to have answers to some boards. I typically only side out of 2 copies of Curtain Raiser or Extras if I'm going first or second, but you need minimum one of each regardless of turn order. As for the Abyss Scripts, the only required ones are 2 copies of Abysstainment, which can be searched and and then used to recycle the other scripts while also having one of the best secondary script effects. Rise of the Abyss King is a stellar piece to bait out negation and break boards. I only run less than 3 due to size concerns. Opening Ceremony has an AMAZING effect when popped and has niche uses in very grindy games. Fantasy magic is the weakest script, but it is a searchable out to Dragoon, and other untargetable threats (this could be a 3rd Rise or a Romantic Terror if you're not afraid of Dragoon).  GOING FIRST: Going first is the weaker option for this deck, you won't be able to set up that heavy of a board every time as you will often end up xenolocking yourself to only abyss actors, which do very little to interrupt your opponent. The main disruptions you will be trying to achieve are the following:  Field Spell Setup: either a live Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater or a set Metaverse to go into Mystic Mine. This is either a full stun or a negate + pop of a set script which hopefully gets you by to you're next turn where your advantage will crush the opponent.  Amorphage setup: Amorphage Sloth can be searched with revolution dragon (which can be searched with sky Iris) and summoned with extreme ease with Abyss Actor - Hyper Director. If you can also grab lechery you can also turn off spells for your opponent.  Metaphys Horus: Halqifibrax + a level 4 abyss actor can turn into a formula synchron and then a Metaphys Horus which will steal a monster and negate a card.  If you can't get those, your last ditch options will be number 41, turn 1 vortex, or Archethys. If you can live a turn and not lose your generated advantage to specific blowout cards you will be in a stellar position to control the flow of the duel from then on.  GOING SECOND: Going second is very free form, prioritize getting out as many ED summons as you can out first before xenolocking yourself to Abyss Actors, then attempt to remove problems with Rise of the Abyss King and Comic relief. Popping a key Abyss Script should be next priority as most decks that didn't OTK you won't be able to keep pace with you once you've popped Opening Ceremony or Abysstainment. This deck is very capable of dismantling very big boards with a lot of negates with most of its hands.  MYSTIC MINE: This deck can play liberally while under mystic mine.  Abysstainment, Curtain Raiser, and Superstar make a small engine that can let you continually reuse scripts and generate advantage, all while getting rid of all your monsters before the end phase. If you can find space for a Duelist Alliance package, strongly consider running Pendulum Switch, which under your own mystic mine can allow you to clog your opponents board with comic reliefs and deny them outs that aren't spells. You could also run more copies of Mystic Mine, but you don't want to brick and you already can search it via terraforming/metaverse.  &nbsp;  EVENLY and ZEUS: This deck's biggest weakness is Divine Arsenal AA Zeus - Sky Thunder, and the even more deadly Evenly Matched. There is very little you can do against these kinds of blowouts, and even worse you lose all the advantage you've generated, which normally gimps your rebuttal and ends the duel. It's extremely dangerous going first if you know your opponent is running it. You should always avoid going first against decks with this option if you can."

Super Polymerization works to take out opponent monsters that can't be gotten around, while activating grave effects. Minerva is useful at getting more cards in either the grave or hand, Curious is good for sending specific cards to the grave, and Shaddoll Construct is good for getting another fusion Shaddoll out. Judgement Dragon and Chaos Emporer Dragon - Envoy of the End are the two good beatsticks that can special summon themselves thanks to cards in the grave.  Biggest flaw is the chance of sending too many to the grave too fast, causing your own defeat, which I'm trying out different ways to avoid it.  This deck is still a work in progress, and if anyone has any tips, I'm open for suggestions"
