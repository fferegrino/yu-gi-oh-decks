Fourthly, these decks are generally not a mix of archetypes as its what i prefer.

This deck has 2 main strategies, the first one is to leave on board multiple interruption to your oponent like poping card on his field, and linking his special summoned monsters, and the second strategy is leaving a gryphon lock, putting him in the center of the field, making your oponent face a very strong floodgate, and also, with some interruptions, like the pop from Evil Twin Lil-la, so you can protect your gryphon even better from monsters like Pankratops.  In this video i show some replays where you can see the basic combos and some more advanced ones. I hope you guys enjoy the deck :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgzd9L_zXo"

You going seconds because its likely they will be playing sweaty decks like blue eyes / dragon decks / meta decks where they will be playing so many cards to get stronger monsters out. you can literally say bye bye to those cards.</li>  	<li>Trishula, Zero Dragon is always your aim to get out, if it gets destroyed it activates a GY effect to special summon trishula to the field with atk of 3300 damage. A great way to keep your field with stronger monsters.</li>  	<li>If trishula is not possible, you have back up plans like White aura synch monster. For example Bihamut (Lvl 10 synchro), cheaper than trishula, can also special summon a token with 3300 ATK / 3000 defence into defence position each turn you do not control a token summoned by him, essentially meaning you have some block from taking damage. Use this time to get more ice barriers to get out the ""Trishula, Zero"". Alternatively, white aura Whale's effect can destory all attack position monsters on your opponents field, as it doesnt target, it is a great way of clearing cards like Borreload dragon. The fact it can make two attacks per turn too helps clear the rest of the board, including piercing damage on defence monsters, its an all round great card.</li> </ul>"

This is deck #50 for me on this site (#52 actually, but never mind that) and it has been a journey indeed. I enjoy making decks/writing deck descriptions and posting them on this site and for deck number 50 I wanted to do something special! I decided to make an Atlantean Mermail list with an in depth description! Why Atlantean of all things? Because it is a really fun deck to play (in my opinion) and it is also considerable difficulty to play as well, so I will share my knowledge with you. This list also uses Retort Fusion (DAMA) and does not use the new level 5 Deep Sea Synchro since I feel like (from a lot of testing) that it is not needed or good in general. I really hope you enjoy this deck description and if you do make sure to like this post (here on YGOPROdeck) so that I know you want more like this. If this gets enough likes (10 or more) I will make more detailed deck descriptions!! My goal at the end of this article is to get you a solid understanding of how to play this deck on a competitive level. I highly recommend trying this deck out, not only is it very fun to play - It is also a strong deck. Well, without further ado, here we go!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you would like to look at the combos, feel free to check out my Youtube video - I explain all the deck ratios in there as well :)</span>  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3YypxgGiMs</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Intro and Credits</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Mermails were actually really good last year (both the VFD turbo and the hand loop variants) but if you think about it, as of now the deck has suffered a lot of hits such as Jet Synchron (pretty significant but can be replaced at a cost of not playing too many cards that are not water), O-lion (this is huge), linkross (made the deck more consistent but is not really needed otherwise) and VFD as well (end board monster you can make after looping 3-4 cards). This deck is inspired off of OCG lists that topped tournaments and also from some lists on youtube. Huge shoutout to </span><a><span>Shire</span></a><span> for some of the deck ratio numbers and combos! One thing about the ocg is that they still have O-lion, Jet synchron AND VFD as well (is at 1)!! This is an outrage! (They even have Colossus and a lot of other stuff we don’t and somehow that is fair). This list differs a little from the OCG lists and is more TCG focused but I assure you, it can still do some crazy things like before! This list can do both hand loops for 4-5 cards and set up 2-3 negates or even go in a full negate based path if needed. Keep in mind all the combos are Nibiru proof as well so that is 1 problem out of the way (that that nibiru! hahahahaha - sorry it's a combo player thing). </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Main Deck Ratios</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Atlantean Prince</b><span> - This is your main starter and can give you access to basically anything since you can mill Dragoons and search for another Dragoons using it’s effect. 100% have to maximize on it and it’s secondary effect is also good (monster reborn like effect if sent to GY) so it serves as an extender as well if drawn at multiple copies or with other normal summons. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Atlantean Dragoons</b><span> - Oh boy here we go! Literally all the cards with “Dragoon” in the name are insanely broken for some reason lol. This is your main searcher that gives you access to your entire deck (literally). It’s effect is not once per turn as well so it is the best thing in the world if you draw it. This is the best card in the entire deck hands down and if you are not playing 3 copies, I’m sorry to say but there is something wrong with you (sorry!).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Atlantean Heavy Infantry</b><span> - This card is great removal if discarded from the hand (basically a Zoodiac Drident) and can also be used to gain a Normal Summon. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Diva</b><span> - Another main normal summon card that enables huge combos and gives you access to your Atlantean Prince! Best starter in the deck and you need to maximize on this, very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Minstrel </b><span>- this is also an amazing draw and drawing it early lets you play through handtraps (I like to rub it into nibiru’s face - it makes me feel good) and get water monsters (like Dragoons) from your hand into the graveyard. Drawing it also enables you to search something else with dragoons to further extend plays (you search minstrel in some of the combos btw). </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mermail Abyssmegalo</b><span> - This guy is a little interesting. He does require 2 discards so I decided to play only 1 (some people play 2 but 3 is not recommended). It helps get water monsters in the GY and also searches for a trap as well. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Mermail Abyssgunde</b><span> - this is also an interesting card, it is used in the combos and is searchable but I opted to only play 2 copies instead of 3 because you will not always have a mermail in the grave (you are really not running that many) so I opted to play 2. Still a very important combo piece.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mermail Abysspike</b><span> - Again, just 1 copy since you can search it and because it is a normal summon (don’t want to open too many normal summons). Still a solid card that gets stuff into the GY and helps combos.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Mermail Abyssteus</b><span> - Here we go again! This card not only is an extender but it enables so many combos/plays and you NEED 3 of this like dragoons. It gets things into the Grave, special summons itself and even searches a mermail which is amazing! Extender and combo enabler all in 1!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord </b><span>- this card is insanely powerful, it can special itself from the hand and can also rip 2 cards out of your opponent’s hand!! Only one copy needed since it can be searched.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Fishborg Launcher</b><span> - Amazing card to summon with halq (it's basically a jet synchron) and is not a brick if drawn (can discard it and then it will resurrect itself). Some people are playing 2 of these but I decided to go for 1 because some of the extra deck monsters/main deck monsters are not water so you can’t use it’s effect.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Lappis Dragon</b><span> - This can be search with dragoon to go into synchro plays.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Aqua Spirit</b><span> - Amazing extender, also lets you get into bahamut shark easier so that you can end on an extra toadally awesome as an OMNI negate or for anti nibiru protection!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Sea Turtle Kaiju</b><span> - This is a form of removal. That is why I am only running 2 copies, since prosperity can dig for it if needed. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Swap Frog</b><span> - You need to play this because Froge best. Swap frog is an amazing extender which can help dump your cards into the Graveyard and also help in getting toadally awesome out! </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> - This is for Frog combos, and it is a brick you do not want to draw - you can simply discard it if you draw it. Playing this brick is well worth it because it can summon itself back from the graveyard multiple times generating so much advantage!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Deskbot 001</b><span> - Great Combo enabler, is kind of a brick when drawn, simply means a -1 (need to summon with halq from the hand).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Deep Sea Aria</b><span> - this card is literally insane, being able to search for almost anything in the entire deck, very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Retort Fusion </b><span>- This is the best extender in the entire deck, and it also allows Halq turbo to be possible in case you get hit with droll or something like that.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Abyss-sphere </b><span>- This is something you can search with Megalo, it helps to extend/pressure the opponent and is also used in the combo!! I’m running this instead of the Mizuchi equip spell because the equip spell only works if you have a mermail on the field and you don’t have mermails in your end boards a whole lot.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck Cards -</b>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>1x </span>Trishula, Dragon of the Ice barrier <span> - Great removal card (banishes from field and GY as well) and can also be used to handloop! This card I especially like in the handloop combo because it banishes from the hand (and 1 from the GY, can be one you looped earlier) so if you are going against a GY deck like eldlich, you can guarantee value!! Used in the combos as well btw.</span></b></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Deep Sea Prima Donna</b><span> - This card is literally insane, being able to special summon from the deck is insane and it is used in combos as well. It can also recycle banished cards (another thing to keep in mind).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Adamancipator Dragite</b><span> - This is a card you can make easily, it is generic spell/trap negate and is also a water monster in case you are locked after using Coral Anemone and whatnot. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Borreload Savage Dragon</b><span> - Ah, you gotta love a dragon link card, but this is actually a generic Omni negate, which can help your combos stay nibiru proof even after you return the nibiru you banished (with minstrel) to the opponent’s hand (with Prima donna). Great card to have in your end board, no arguments there!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Virtual World Shenshen</b><span> - This is another card you can have in your endboard (in the deep sea diva combo) and it is a Macro Cosmos! This card is Insane and you must play it!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Desert Locusts</b><span> - an extra hand rip you can summon with halq during your opponent's turn!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Crystron Halqifibrax</b><span> - Oh yeah, synchro deck? You need this guy, it's literally a law or something (except if you are playing Junk Speeder lol). This card also has another purpose in the deck other than just the tuner from the deck. Halq will be on our end board sometimes and you can use him to make Desert Locusts during your opponent’s turn for an extra handrip! (Insert maniacally laugh here)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Marincess Coral Anemone </b><span>- This card is a generic reborn and can be great for a comeback and that is why I decided to play it at 2 copies (you use 1 for the combo) just in case. It’s only downside is that it locks you to water only for the rest of the turn (keep this in mind!).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mecha Phantom Beast Arouradon </b><span>- This is to go into synchro plays and goes well with Halq (summons deskbot and now you have 2+ machines). Very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Sea Monster </b><span>- This guy is really useful and can be summoned off of Retort Fusion and it is also a water!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Mistar Boy </b><span>- generic link 2 which can be used to OTK as well</span> <span> </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Accesscode</b><span> - OTK and for removal as well</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Bahamut Shark</b><span> - this card is so good, it can summon toadally from the extra deck and if you detach Dragoons to use it’s effect, Guess what! You get another search!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Toadally Awesome</b><span> - This card is insane, an Omni negate and if your opponent was using a staple, you get to eat it onto your field! This also makes the combos nibiru proof and when it’s sent to the GY, it can recycle a water to your hand which is HUGE because you literally mill all 3 dragoons in your first turn most of the time lol.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Well, that is all I have for this deck explanation, I really hope you enjoyed and even have a basic understanding of how to play this deck!

If going first, set as many cards as possible, and be as aggressive as you can during their turn. If going 2nd, a good strategy is to set both Solemn Strike and Fossil Dyna, then during their battle phase, use Fossil's flip effect to destroy their monsters, while Solemn Striking any effect that might protect them from Fossil.</li>  	<li>If going first and you have both Fossil and Boarder in your hand, always prefer to summon Fossil first, as preventing the opponent from special summoning in the first place is much more important than locking any of their monster effects (plus, if they special summon from the Extra Deck, then Inspector Boarder becomes way less helpful anyway).</li>  	<li>Don't be too greedy with Pot of Desires; if you're down to 20 cards already, and PoD is an option, think carefully before you take the risk of removing another 10 cards from play.</li>  	<li>Try to bait Ash Blossom with Pot of Desires first, then use Pot of Duality; the former gives you two random cards, but the latter allows you to pick one out of three, and that's more important in this build.</li>  	<li>Don't use Card of Demise if you've already summoned a monster, as if you draw another one with Demise, you'll have to send it to the GY at the end of the turn.</li>  	<li>If you can afford it, Pot of Extravagance (along with an Extra Deck) might be better option than Pot of Desires, since with it, you don't have to worry about losing your monsters. However, Extravagance doesn't work well with the rest of the draw cards (Demise, Upstart Goblin etc.), so keep that in mind.</li> </ul> Notes:  This build, or ones slightly different to it, have been tested from October 2020 up to this day. For an anti-meta build, it's adequately competitive, as I've had a decent win/loss ratio of 2.19 against much more competitive builds such as Shaddol, Salamangreat, Numeron, Eldlich variants etc. (not counting single duels or quitters in matches). I prompt you to give it a try for yourselves, and leave any feedback on the comments. :)"

Spell Ruler seemed like a particularly promising set due to its abundancy of broken spells and decent equip spells. The last one actually was a staple in my friends' decks so it was reasonable to assume that they would be salivating over even the worse ones in here; they all are better than what we got in the previous sets, after all. Being prepared against those seemed (and indeed was) vital.  As for the broken spells... Imagine not pulling any of those and you'd have my situation. I did get two Spellbinding Circle, though, which is at least decent. Cyber Jar also was a very welcome addition to the deck.  I personally looked forward to the recruiters (Monsters that special summon a monster with 1,5k or less Atk from the deck after being destroyed by battle) since they would outline the direction I would be going into for the weeks to come.  My pulls gave me two options: Wind beatdown when the field spells drop and Earth with utility options. I hoped for a few Mother Grizzly to go in on an Umi deck with A Legendary Ocean later, but ended up pulling not a single one. Seeing that pretty much all of the winds printed so far were garbage whereas Earth had possibilities with Labyrinth Wall and Dream Clown as utility slots, my choice was simple.  The deck doesn't really have a cohesive strategy, but instead aims to profit from its wide variety of utility cards and removal to keep the upper hand. Equip spam joined tribute summoning Sanga of the Thunder/Suijin as potential for continuous board domination, however. The biggest enabler of my previous ""strategy"" was Yami, so it had no place in the deck anymore. Hey, at least Gaia, Succubus Knight and pretty much all of LoB's monster lineup can chill there now over Sogen!  Staying true to that, I cut down on the 2k defenders. Given the preferences of my small circle of friends, most of these would be wrecked before accumulating board advantage by numbers. I only kept those with reasonably high attack to possibly establish a board presence with equips. They were replaced by a swarming engine with a playset of Giant Germ which was supposed to enable my Tributes faster than the big-butted vanillas ever could.  Given this bigger focus on offense, I brought out the biggest non-tribute beaters I had to offer in Whiptail Crow and Seven-Colored Fish. Despite not getting punished for it, the former was a HUGE theoretical mistake. Guardian Of The Throne Room has the same stat line but an immunity against Paralyzing Potion which still is a decent stun option and would be much more relevant in utility!  Dark Elf and Jirai Gumo still are the ""reverse walls"" (monsters that discourage attacks with massive attack over massive def without any attacking themselves) they were before with the difference that attacking became much more enticing due to the massive amount of equip spells floating around. They also form the magic six (more than 50% chance to have one of those cards in your opening five) with my other walls, though incidentally so here.  The only exception to walling up being bad is, yeah, the wall in the deck. 3k still is very difficult to overcome even in a meta filled to the brim with equip spells. And it's even better if you can cheat it out without a tribute using a Giant Rat after your opponent's last attack! Dream Clown was my alternative rat target and supposed to put me in a position to destroy any particularly large or dominant monster by switching it to def in my following turn.  Speaking of, the clowns were thrown back on the bench other than this one copy of Dream Clown. Crass Clown already had trouble competing in Metal Raiders format stat-wise and an even more offensively oriented meta would't be kind to it. His work partner Dream Clown still had uses, but none that justified running additional copied that could potentially clog up my hand. It would be easy to beat over even with equips but still had utility as a follow up with Rat, so one copy was just right.  Cyber Jar is just Dark Hole and a way to fill up your field or hand. It's an amazing card that usually gets you out of tough spots. Since we play on the Traditional F&amp;L list (with modifications done by the group as seen fit or when one player starts to dominate the field), the card was fair game. The consistency boost still is much appreciated. Don't set it on a neutral or good board state; it's the equivalent of throwing dice on the table and praying you roll all sixes.  Dark Hole, Fissure and Tribute To The Doomed just are more removal tools.  Even though giving your opponent 1k LP is so much worse in a slow-as-molasses Yugioh compared to modern standard, I still just enjoy playing 39 cards over 40. Consistency is key, and my decks need it badly given my lack of Pot Of Greed or searchers.  Paralyzing Potion still is the decent stun it also was in the week before and the other equips are just the best I got in terms of attack power. I went for the magic six as border for equips since they are only situationally useful at the end of the day, but should be usually on given my monster count. Wouldn't want to see more than one in an opener tbh; they clog your hand without any summonable monster.  The star of the week and by far my favorite card of this week was Tailor Of The Fickle, however. The card is super versatile and even more so with the absurd amount of variety in equips that were run in the group: It could be a watered-down Rush Recklessly (something I also failed to pull), effectively boost two of your monsters with one equip during the battle phase by activating Tailor after attacking with the equipped monster, shuffle Paralyzing Potions or Stim-Pack drops... The card was amazing and thankfully, most of my friends caught on in building this time. I used it in all of my games and usually had a pretty significant momentum shift in my favor everytime I resolved it.  Swords still enables tributes which only get better with Tailor and own equips.  Dual Mirror Force still is just broken at this stage of the game. Fun fact: Right after winning this week, we unanimously limited the card to one. Two of my friends also had it and we didn't want to inevitably hit those two as well. The limit hurt me and me alone, seeing as I am the only one in the group with more copies.  Spellbinding Circle was pretty much more a more consistent and reliable Paralyzing Potion. It was immune to Tailor Of The Fickle which made it a much safer bet than Paralyzing Potion for slowing a game down. It performed well this week but this will most likely be the last opportunity for that to be the case. The next set has Jinzo and much more S/T-removal.  The Extra still is just personal aesthetic preference and all part of a long-term scheme that will effectively hide any plans of using this portion of the game later.  The side was engineered to be a smokescreen into a degenerate burn/stall portion more true to what I played in the last weeks. I never used any of those cards - but one of my friends did. He almost kicked my butt since I had trouble getting anything going... But all monster advantage falters in the presence of Dark Hole. The smokescreen also had no cohesive plan: Do I want my opponent to attack and use card effects or do I want them not to attack? The cards point in both directions and kind of get in the way of each other. Go for better stuff than this! Even a side board of Remove Traps would have been better."

WHIIP GOOD!,"LADIES , GENTLEMANS AND NON- BINARY PEOPLE, This is my attempt to make this deck kind of competitive. My last Witchcrafter deck was a more a fun/casual oriented (I was using banned cards), but this I tried and tested a lot to came with this build. It's  a very explosive build ( Verre can become almost  A Gren maju in terms of atk value) but some times you can play in a more conservative way, nevertheless it's a lot of fun.  &nbsp;  <b><i>Witchcrafter,  Artificers of magic!!</i></b>  The Witchcrafter archetype is adorable in all artwork that is presented, linking the lore of the spellcaster universe ( Endymion, Spellbook, Invokeds), making a third force to  balance power between them. They don't store knowledge like  Prophecy-Spellbook or  use knowledge for power and war like Endymion, instead they use for  (like the name says) craft magic artefacts  that which one of the Witchcrafter are responsible for one process (pottery , glass, jewelry, etc). Enough about them, let’s get into the deck.  &nbsp;  <b>Main deck </b><b><i>Monsters:</i></b>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Schmietta"">Witchcrafter Schmietta</a>: </b> every low level  Witchcrafter has the effect which she can tribute herself, then  discard a spell card to summon any Witchcrafter from the deck. What  makes <b>Witchcrafter Schmietta</b> unique is the ability to send any Witchcrafter card, in special <b><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a></b> for crazy combos later on.  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Genni"">Witchcrafter Genni</a>: </b>Genni was the “glue” that this deck was lacking.The effect that she banished herself with another Witchcrafter spell card to use this effect again… it’s crazy.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Pittore"">Witchcrafter Pittore</a>: </b>Pittore is very risky but with so many Witchcrafter spell cards in theis deck, I think this is enough.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Potterie"">Witchcrafter Potterie</a>: </b>She does absolutely nothing ‘cause Witchcrafter spell cards can recover from the  GY by themself, but … man… she is adorable lol.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Golem Aruru"">Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</a>: </b>a beefie Hand trap, the ability to bounce any opponent’s monster  or recover a <b> </b>Witchcrafter  spell card and with 2800 ATK it’s even more juicy.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>: </b>Can pop a face up card  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Edel"">Witchcrafter Edel</a>: </b>Edel was more useful in the past, but today with <b> <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Unveiling"">Witchcrafter Unveiling</a> </b>is no longer escential, nevertheless is a good beater.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Mademe Verre"">Witchcrafter Mademe Verre</a>: </b>The favorite snob loli, this little brat it’s  an <i>Inferno </i>(i’m cursing in my native language). She can negate a face up monster by discarding a spell card, boost a spellcaster by  1000 ATK for which  different spell card in your hand, combos with <b><a data-name=""Spell Chronicle"">Spell Chronicle</a> and <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a>… </b> Now I know why she looks so snobbish in the artwork.  <strong>2x Effect veiler: </strong> one of my favorite hand traps and also a Spellcaster. A Fantastic way to deals with the majority of monster.  &nbsp;  <b>Spell cards</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Holiday"">Witchcrafter Holiday</a>: </b>Every spell card of this archetype returns for the player hand if weren’t used in this turn, and of course has an additional unique effect.This card is basically  a monster reborn for the archetype.  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Unveiling"">Witchcrafter Unveiling</a>: </b>Special summons any Witchcrafter from your hand, the department  that was lacking in this deck.  <b> </b>  <b>3x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Creation"">Witchcrafter Creation</a>: </b>Search any Witchcrafter monster from your deck  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a>: </b>Can make you draw a card if your  Witchcrafter monster destroys another monster by attack. <b> </b>  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Bystreet"">Witchcrafter Bystreet</a>: </b>Protects your monster for one destruction.  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Draping"">Witchcrafter Draping</a>: </b>a Mystical Space Typhoon on steroids, bouncing any spell/trap card up the number Witchcrafter you control.  &nbsp;  1x <strong>Secret  Village of the  Spellcaster</strong>: An awesome floodgate in spellcaster based deck that can shut down any deck that is reliant in spell cards  &nbsp;  <b>1x <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>: </b>search <b> <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a></b> card.  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>: </b>a draw card for spellcaster type monster, can even put some GY setup for future plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>1X Called by the  Grave</strong>: The perfect anti hand trap and Gy plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>2x Pot of  Extravagance: </strong>Draw even more cards  &nbsp;  <b>Trap cards</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Patronus"">Witchcrafter Patronus</a>: </b>the effect that matters is the GY one. Banishing itself to add to you handy  any Witchcrafter card with different names from your banishment pile… is insane if you consider you are running  <b><a data-name=""Spell Chronicle"">Spell Chronicle</a> </b>in this deck.  &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck</b>  &nbsp;  The extra deck is more kind of a tool to deal with the unknown, so  I’ll not discuss it. Your main play is on the main deck, fell free to put whatever you want.  &nbsp;  <b>Conclusion</b>  A very fun waifu deck , with so many options and so insane plays..

The First Darklord was a busted card that was just waiting for the right support. ,"The idea of the deck is too summon the First Darklord with the effect of the field, then keep bringing back your superbias and fairies with it for some nice +2 every turn. The endboard depends on the hand but at the very least you can have the First D and Dramaturgia and when you open well you can end on the First D + I.P + Condemned + Ixchel/Nasten with some traps in GY.  I.P is really good in the deck, the fact that you can bring back 2 monsters during your oponnent's turn means that you can immediately  go into Goddess of the closed world using one of your opponent's monster. The interactions with the field, jester and curtain rise in grave mean that the first D is actually kinda hard to out and always comes back so the deck has a very good grind game."

The deck is also possibly anti-meta but I'm not sure since it respects people's graves.

Well, it's time to put you on the test... These bosses won't be easy to kill... You still wanna p","Hi !  There is a ""Competitive"" version of the Generaider deck. This deck's advantage is that it build easely strong interruptions, with a lot of varied effects and without (most of the time) using your normal summon (except with ""<em><strong>Loptr, Shadow Of The Generaider Bosses</strong></em>"", that can tribute himself to special summon from the deck ""<em><strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss Of Light</strong></em>"" and then be able to search for your ""<em><strong>Generaider Boss Stage</strong></em>"" or ""<em><strong>Generaider Boss Quest</strong></em>"" but it doesn't happend often).  This is why I play the Invoked engine, because the normal summon is needed for ""<em><strong>Aleister The Invoker</strong></em>"" and is useless of Generaider. Plus, the Invoked engine can be used as a shield for ""<em><strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong></em>"" or to protect you from ""<em><strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong></em>"" and is super-consistent, at least 13 starters on your deck, even without ""Generaider Boss Fight"", that can be sometimes situational. <ul>  	<li>3 Loptr, Shadow Of The Generaider Bosses</li>  	<li>3 Generaider Boss Stage</li>  	<li>3 Aleister The Invoker</li>  	<li>3 Magical Meltdown</li>  	<li>1 Terraforming</li> </ul> But the big problem of this deck is that it is extremely dependant to the field spell. Furthermore, ""<strong><em>Cosmic Cyclone</em></strong>"" will be your worst knightmare (got it ?), since you won't be able to activate it again with ""<em><strong>Generaider Boss Fight</strong></em>"".

The ""Aesir""-""Nordic"" conglomate came out during the same time when ""Six Samurai"" were en vogue (again) and even had some struggles early in their lifetime. However, back in the day the ability to summon out a 4000 ATK beater semi-consistently was quite impressive, so they managed to turbo out a beatstick and win the game from there on a regular basis. However, time was not kind to the nordic pantheon of Yugioh, the game got faster and having big boss monsters became less impressive, leaving the archetype in their current state even after receiving a few support cards to help them out. After consulting the ""Nordic"" Discord channel and working through the cards the archetype has to offer, I came up with this:</p> <p>The ""Nordic Beasts"" are definitely the branch to play in my opinion as they are easily the best as well as relative easy to support via generic cards. ""<a data-name=""Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts"">Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" is really just a Level 4 Tuner, but once in a blue moon you might be able to Special Summon it using its own effect. The goats in form of ""<a data-name=""Tanngrisnir of the Nordic Beasts"">Tanngrisnir of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Tanngnjostr of the Nordic Beasts"">Tanngnjostr of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" can provide floating effects, more chump blockers on board and, eventually, Synchro material to go into the big guys. ""<a data-name=""Vanadis of the Nordic Ascendant"">Vanadis of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" is the least restrictive Tuner monster the ""Nordics"" have to offer while also being able to change her level if really necessary, ""<a data-name=""Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant"">Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" can kickstart a summon into an ""Aesir"" monster without the need of accessing the Extra Deck beforehand and ""<a data-name=""Mimir of the Nordic Ascendant"">Mimir of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" is one of the saddest tries to swarm that I have personally seen so far, but I still run it at one for the lack of better options and potentially having Spell cards in the deck that outlive their usefulness over the course of the game. ""<a data-name=""Alviss of the Nordic Alfar"">Alviss of the Nordic Alfar</a>"" can also kickstart an ""Aesir"" summon and give them some more longevity. There are only a few generic monster options, one being three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Cat"">Rescue Cat</a>"" since the kitty can fetch the ""Nordic"" goats, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Performapal Hip Hippo"">Performapal Hip Hippo</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>"".</p> <p>Speaking of that Spell card, you might notice that there are both three copies of ""<a data-name=""Hippo Carnival"">Hippo Carnival</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>"", which are in the deck to pay for the cost of the ""Nordic"" Link monster ""<a data-name=""Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant"">Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"", which normally needs a bunch of cards to get an ""Aesir"" monster onto the board, but can now use the tokens in a way that leaves your other resources intact while also working around the Extra Deck ban the tokens normally impose onto you. One ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" clears the field and can be fairly helpful since there are OTK scenarios the deck can make use of sometimes, while three ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" might drive the price of the deck up, but are frankly the only thing I have found that helps with the poor consistency of the archetype overall.</p> <p>There are also a few Traps: Two ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" can search the others, while two ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" might not be everyones favorite but can potentially keep you alive for longer. Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Nordic Relic Megingjord"">Nordic Relic Megingjord</a>"" can double the attack of one of your ""Nordic"" or ""Aesir"" monsters, which also causes them to be unable to attack directly, but also gives cards like ""<a data-name=""Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts"">Guldfaxe of the Nordic Beasts</a>"" 3200 ATK to beat over monsters that would be normally out of its reach, while ""Aesir"" boss monsters can try to pull a ""Utopia Double"" move and hit stuff for 8000 ATK (in case of ""<a data-name=""Odin, Father of the Aesir"">Odin, Father of the Aesir</a>""). Two ""<a data-name=""Divine Relic Mjollnir"">Divine Relic Mjollnir</a>"" can improve your ""Aesir"" monsters by giving one of the a second attack, which is okay-ish but provides killing potential against monsters and players alike, and the two ""Solemns"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" round the deck up nicely while giving at least some disruption to a deck without any.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is packed with lots of multiples due to ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"": Three ""<a data-name=""Odin, Father of the Aesir"">Odin, Father of the Aesir</a>"" are your main beaters with the highest stat line and temporal immunity to Spell/Trap effects, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Thor, Lord of the Aesir"">Thor, Lord of the Aesir</a>"" can stop opposing monster effects during your turn, and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant"">Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant</a>"" are absolutely crucial to get into the ""Aesirs"" quickly. Aside from that, there is one ""<a data-name=""Loki, Lord of the Aesir"">Loki, Lord of the Aesir</a>"" for the rare cases when he provides something the others cannot, one ""<a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a>"" for removal via banishment, ""<a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"" against decks that might struggle to get removal to kill it, ""<a data-name=""F.A.

There are various ""Nordic"" cards that I did not feature in this deck list, but if you want to look at what else they have to offer or even give building a ""Nordic"" deck a shot, feel free to visit my ""Aesir""/""Nordic"" archetype analysis on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/02/27/archetype-analysis-nordic/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/02/27/archetype-analysis-nordic/</a>"
