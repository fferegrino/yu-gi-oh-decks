The deck works by giving Ryu Okami to your opponent through Summon Sorceress and milling Cyber Dragon Nova to special summon machine fusion monsters from the extra deck. The deck won't work if the opponent's zones in front of the extra monster zones are occupied or if either Summon Sorceress or Ryu Okami get negated.  Having Ryu Okami in your hand is mandatory for the deck to work: destroy Mariamne with Diagram or another Mariamne to search it out.  Second step is to summon Summon Sorceress, which you can do in three ways <ul>  	<li>discard Rosenix or Thystvern to special summon Sulfefnir, destroy it with its effect to summon Citree and use Rosenix's token or Thystvern's search to go into Needlefiber, use its effect to special summon another Citree and go into Sorceress;</li>  	<li>special summon Terrortop and bring out Taketomborg, then summon any Crystron and go directly into Sorceress;</li>  	<li>summon a True King and Al-Lumi'raj to go Needlefiber -&gt; Citree -&gt; Sorceress; Al-Lumi'raj can be brought out by destroying Bahrastos.</li> </ul> Now the combo begins: special summon Ryu Okami to your opponent's field with Sorceress' first effect, then use its second effect to bring out a True King: this way Ryu will start milling your Extra Deck.  Megaton is a big beater, Mechaba negates, ABC banishes, Chimeratech dumps ABC's materials and attacks multiple times, Omega recycles Nova and Herald, Herald searches Lord Of The Red and Advanced Ritual Art, Nova summons fusions (except ABC) and Saryuja and Goblin expand your Extra Monster Zones."

First of all, this deck is so much fun to play in my opinion so please enjoy the deck! I have play tested this deck so much from scratch and it has become really good. I was able to beat Trickstar Sky Striker three times in a row with this deck and many other meta and tier two decks. The goal of the deck is to always go second and special summon Kaijus to your opponents field in the same column as their spell/traps are and then special summon Mekk-Knights! <a data-name=""Psi-Blocker"">Psi-Blocker</a> is super helpful too to block off cards your opponent needs to win once you know what deck they are playing. Use <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> to dominate meta players and make them banish their core pieces. <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a> is really good to side in against decks that like removing your backrow. Once they try to remove it they will be stuck with <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> on your side of the field and that will win you the game! <a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a> is a spicy tech card I threw in to help counter Trickstars and Chain Burn since they inflict so much damage. One awesome combo I love to do is special summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Blue Sky"">Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</a> and then normal summon Cherries or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and synchro into <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>.

Very useful in this deck is also obviously dragon shrine send a normal one and diabolos or lightpulsar to ss by sending 1 light 1 dark from hand to grave so many combos"

Flower Cardians are able to aquire a large board in a single turn and able to summon 4,"<strong>Flower Cardian - An Original</strong>  <em><strong>Core Strategy -  </strong></em>The optimal strategy for this deck is to open with either a Polymerization into <strong>Itaden the Conquer Star </strong>or <strong>Flower Gathering</strong> w/ <b>Either Calligrapher </b>cards SS into <strong>LightShower </strong>or the Boss Monster <strong>LightFlare</strong>.  Both strats are ideal for going second so you can counteract your opponents opener. <strong>Itaden's </strong>ability to not only negate but reduce opponents atk to 0 is extremely efficient for removing other boss monsters. The <strong>LightShower </strong>opener is if you know you'll be in a long match against stall decks or turtles. <strong>LightFlare </strong>is the King of efficency in this deck uinmatched with a staggering 5000 Atk points and negating enemy effects, combined with <strong>LightShower</strong> they can become a extremely deadly duo.  <em>Note~This deck was a fun design I came up with yesterday so it does have flaws here and there however the performance with a semi-optimal hand gave amazing results.

He is an amazing guy and outstanding friend to have. Even though he couldn't win the entire NAWCQ he was still able to get Top 64 after the banlist killing <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a>. Jeremy is a professional Pendulum Magician player who has been playing Pendulum Magicians since they first got released in 2014. He has topped many events but his biggest successes are the recent 2017 UDS in Orlando, Florida and the 2018 YCS Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. He got 2nd place at the UDS and 1st place at YCS Atlanta. He has also topped many regionals this past year. All of the events Jeremy has topped have been with Pendulum Magicians. After Jeremy testing different Pendulum Magician builds from scratch, this is the one he came up with before the NAWCQ that got him Top 64. It is very consistent and plays nicely. If you have experience with Pendulum Magicians then this deck should be easy for you to master!  Here is the full deck profile link on YouTube if you wish to go check it out. Please thumbs up the video and support him and his amazing top at the 2018 NAWCQ!  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2FFLr6KAE</a>"

It never bricks and can go first or second. Going second is better though since this build runs a lot of handtraps for many reasons. The ghost girls are used to stop your opponent from doing pretty much everything, not only are they good handtraps but you can use them as synchro material with the other Burning Abyss monsters so they aren't bricks in your hand your upcoming turn! That is why this build plays three <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> so that you can send Libic to the graveyard and use his effect to special summon a Burning Abyss monster from your hand and negate its effects. This way you can normal summon a ghost girl and go into <a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> or <a data-name=""Gravity Warrior"">Gravity Warrior</a> which is another cool tech I added in. <a data-name=""Gravity Warrior"">Gravity Warrior</a> is good to use when you're opponent has a lot of monsters on their board and you don't have access to Black Luster Soldier. Since <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> are light monsters, they can be used as material for Black Luster Soldier. Also, Virgil isn't dead! Synchro into <a data-name=""Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss"">Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss</a> in this build using <a data-name=""Rubic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Rubic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> and the other Burning Abyss monsters. Virgil's shuffle effect is very powerful even in today's meta. After testing I have won games because of Virgil! Enjoy the deck and have fun guys."

Summon with Sheep instead of normal summoning if possible. Price: $0.14  3x Edge Imp Chain: Searches a fusion card or counter trap when sent to the graveyard. Also necessary for a very good fusion monster. Price: $0.05  3x Edge Imp Sabres: Necessary for almost all the fusions we do, and it can revive itself too boot. Price: $0.15  3x Fluffal Owl: Searches Polymerization, and can fuse by itself if needed. Price: $0.10  3x Fluffal Sheep: Allows us to use Edge Imp monster’s effects more often. Very good for late-game. Price: $0.09  3x Fluffal Cat: Recycles our Polymerizations. Price: $0.05  3x Fluffal Rabbit: Recycles our Fluffal and Edge Imp monsters. Price: $0.07  3x Frightfur Fusion: Late-game fusion that allows for massive otk’s and board wipes with Frightfur Wolf and Tiger. Price: $0.12  3x Polymerization: Unfortunately, this card is necessary in order for us to summon anything. Don’t waste any. Price: $0.57  1x Dark Hole: Wipes both player’s boards. Good for when you’re behind drastically. Price: $0.08  3x Suture Rebirth: Allows us to recover beaters after a couple turns. If used on Frightfur Sheep, the resurrection effect still works! Price: $0.09  2x Night Beam: Spell and Trap destruction, used in any decent deck-build. Price: $0.16  2x Fluffal Crane: Deck thinning, allowing us to recover from our opponent destroying our on-board fusion material. Price: $0.06  2x Mirror Force: One of the best monster removal cards at this price range. Price: $0.20  3x Frightfur March: Helps our Frightfur monsters stay alive longer. Price: $0.10  Extra Deck:  1x Frightfur Chimera: Our target for Frightfur March. Has a very big body and can give decent rewards since the card you resummon doesn’t have its effects negated. Price: $0.05  2x Frightfur Wolf: OTK machine. 4 Materials = 8000 damage to face. Also very nice for OTK through low ATK boards.

Don't want to spend hundred$ on a deck like them? Use this deck to end them all! Laugh in their face as they sit contemplating t,"This deck is based on cards I actually have. Keep that, and the fact that the fanboy in me shows, in mind. For example, there is only one Buster Dragon because they cost +$6 each. Also, there is a majestic dragon in there because I am a fanboy. This deck is able to run relatively well without spending $100.  I personally find it fun to use. Of course, the main idea is to summon the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon so your opponents monsters are all stuck in defense and unable to use effects. There are other options like Dark Paladin, and the Ebon Magicians, which are both easy to summon with this deck. Number 11 is always nice to have and it is very easy to summon in this deck. Just for extra fun there is the Stardust option and Beelze. Great fun to play a Blue-eyes fanboy and do 10,000 plus damage on a Chaos Max stuck in defense. Any feedback is welcome.  P.S. - I don't use link or pendulum monsters"

There is room to include Called by the Grave &amp; other Floodgates without effecting combo's.  The Deck is built on 3 Combos;  1<strong>. ISOLDE</strong>: Opening up with ""<em>Armageddon Knight</em>"" will let you send ""<em>Destiny Hero - Malicious</em>"" to the GY, allowing you to Special Summon another copy to Link into Isolde. Search and add ""<em>Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</em>"" to your hand OR another ""Armageddon Knight"" if you have ""<em>Allure of Darkness</em>""/ ""<em>Hand Destruction</em>"" in Hand. Use Isolde to send an Equip spell to the GY to special summon ""<em>Destiny Hero - Dark Angel</em>"" &amp; if possible Special Summon another copy of Malicious. You can Link into most LINK - 4 monsters from here or into ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" &amp; ""<em>Linkuriboh</em>"". Also if you have a copy of One for One in hand you can Link into Saryuja.  2.<strong> SERIAL SPELL</strong>: Opening up with ""<em>Pot of Desires</em>"" &amp; ""<em>Serial Spell</em>"" is almost always a Win. It should draw enough power to get you BLS &amp; Primal Seed first turn, and banish enough to allow you to continue your plays with Primal Seed.  3. <strong>GRINDER GOLEM / ONE DAY OF PEACE</strong>: If you open the duel with these 2 Cards in your hand, you're almost GUARANTEED a FTK with Exodia.  **The best thing about Armageddon Knight &amp; Isolde, is you can use them to thin your deck out prior to playing big draw power cards.**  Enjoy this build. I've beaten top tier decks going second &amp; siding in 3x ""Called by the Grave"" instead of 1x ""Dark World Dealings"" | 1x ""Armageddon Knight"" | 1x ""Serial Spell"" ."

Evolzars are not as big, but provide protection in form of negation. <blockquote><div>The playmakers are Oviraptor/Foolish Burial with Overtex. Banishing Giant Rex (if possible) and Oviraptor on the field provide you with materials for ranked 4 Evolzar. Foolish Burial Goods + Blaze Acc. Reload provide the fieldnuke.</div></blockquote> The Deck is certainly not Top-Tier, but can hold its ground quite well against them if you don't brick, which does not happen too often, but drawing 3 scattershots is quite painful.  A weakness of this deck is search negation/prohibition, since the deck has very low draw-power, but good searching power (Fossil Dig, Oviraptor + Overtex, Foolish Burial [Goods], and many more).  It's for sure a ""blast"" to play with this deck. ;)  Have fun!  Juliner"

Prof. Banner will be proud.,"The strategy for this Deck is to remove from play as many cards as you can then either summon Gren, Gandora Giga Rays ,or Golden Homunculus for your advantage. Keep using Golden Sarcophagus to remove Necroface and use its effect.Once Necroface returns to your hand, do not use it unless you are confident to summon it or return your cards back if you do not have the play cards you need.  Pot of Desires also greatly helps in removing as much cards off your deck. The Extra deck structure is optional, it is mostly there to summon Eater of Millions. Freely adjust the Extra Deck for any format to either Link or Non-link. Use Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Fissure and D.D. cards to your advantage both affecting your side and the opponent's side of the field. Soul Release and Fairy Tail - Snow is also useful in removing from play your cards from your graveyard. Caius and Mobius are there to even the field mostly to remove pesky cards. Activate as many Soul Absorption before removing cards to buff up your Life points."

That this deck doesn't work well right? Well, guess again! The Invoked Engine with Burning Abyss works super well. This deck also has a very low brick rate. After building this deck from scratch, testing, and making many edits I found the ratios that work. I was able to beat many meta decks and many tier two decks. The decks goal is to go second and win in two turns, or otk on the second turn after your opponent used up all their resources their first turn to setup. Another thing to remember when playing this deck is that you need to make Dante so you can mill cards from your deck to graveyard like <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a>. Snow is a big pain to deal with, so stack up your graveyard! This deck gives so many resources to you because while you have the Burning Abyss monsters in your hand or Dante on the field, you also have either a boss monster in your hand like Black Luster Soldier, <a data-name=""Orbital Hydralander"">Orbital Hydralander</a>, or <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> which gives you even more boss monsters and resources after your opponent has run out since normally your opponent will only have one or two boss monsters after they've finished their first turn. The deck also mains many handtraps so going second is a breeze and you can make your opponent lose a lot of their resources if you play the handtraps at the correct time. Since the deck runs so many handtraps, plus having your opponents graveyard at your disposal, going into <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> is easy. On the other hand, if you are forced to go first by your opponent, making <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> is very effective at stopping your opponent from doing anything monster effect related turn two. Since many of the decks monsters are dark you shouldn't have a hard time making Caliga going first. There are so many cool tech cards I added in to the deck to make it so great! <a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a> is a great one that I love using on my opponent, and I prefer this over <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> because Mind Control can cause your Burning Abyss monsters to blow themselves up while Creature Swap doesn't and still allows you to use their effects after you destroy them via battle or card effect. Another amazing combo I love doing is with <a data-name=""Tour Bus From The Underworld"">Tour Bus From The Underworld</a>. This card is super effective late game because if you mill it and you've used Beatrice already, you can shuffle her back into the extra deck to make her again! I also don't like using <a data-name=""terraforming"">Terraforming</a> and <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> in this deck because after testing I've realized that since Magical Meltdown counts as a spell card, it prevents you from special summoning the Burning Abyss monsters. Lastly, if you don't like <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, which I do in this deck since you play so many three ofs, you can swap it out with three <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> instead and the deck will still work well. Enjoy and have fun!"

I was able to beat a lot of meta decks with this TKD build. The goal of this deck is to go second and otk them that second turn. This deck hardly ever bricks, in fact every time I've played it I've never had a bad hand. The part of the deck that I noticed it struggles with the most is dealing with backrow so to solve that problem I put a lot of backrow removal in the side deck. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is so good in this deck since you want to go second and you can just use Red Reboot on your opponent during your first turn (second turn of the game) so they can't use backrow anymore is so good because then you can just otk them freely without worrying about all their backrow that will stop you. <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> is also super effective against decks that run field spells like ABC, Lair of Darkness, Pure Dinosaurs, etc... One of my awesome spicy techs I put into the deck is <a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a>. If your opponent has any monster that's not dark type and is a problem for you at that moment you can use Catastor to destroy it. I also love playing this deck because going second they get otkd out of nowhere on the second turn and then don't really know what happened, it's funny. Please enjoy the deck and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!"

This deck is extremely overwhelming going second, so going second is your best bet at winning. I have been able to beat almost all the meta decks using this deck so it is very powerful and can win almost every time. It has has a low brick rate. The goal of the deck is simple, to go second and handtrap your opponent when they are going first and then use their graveyard and/or your handtraps in your hand or grave for Invoked fusion material. You also have the Sky Striker cards at your disposal to draw more cards and use <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> as fusion material for <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>. <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> is really great to screw decks that use a field spell and it's also another <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> basically because you want spell cards in your grave to use the second effect of the Sky Striker cards. Some games I've even been able to get <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> plus two <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>s or an <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> and an <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> depending on how many <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>s I have in hand. This deck is also really good to bait your opponent into wasting their handtraps on the wrong cards e.g. when you have <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> in your hand plus <a data-name=""Sky Stiker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Stiker Mobilize - Engage!</a> and use Engage to bait their Ash Blossom and then summon Aleister to search <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>. Enjoy and have fun."

And it's actually kinda meta. I was surprisingly able to beat a tier two deck, <span class=""module__title__link"">Cinderella, and a lot of tier one decks... I was actually able to beat Pure Dinosaurs, ABC Knightmare, and Pure Sky Strikers. The only problem with this deck is that the brick rate is moderate. You can actually draw too many monsters in your starting hand which will then cause you to lose the game. That has always been the problem when you combine multiple archetypes that are somewhat large. This deck is somewhat meta I would say tier 1.5 maybe. But in the worst case, this deck is always super fun to play against your friends as a casual deck. The goal of this deck is to otk your opponent going second or control your opponent with you going first. You pick! You want to simply mill. That is the goal, that way you can trigger cards like <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>, <a data-name=""Revival Golem"">Revival Golem</a></span>, <a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a>, etc... To special summon from the graveyard so you can make a lot of link monsters or go into <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a>, or <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>, or whatever you want to play to make your opponent suffer from your deck being depleted. <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> kills in this deck. Being able to bait your opponent's handtraps with something like normal summoning <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> and then using Double Evolution Pill to get <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a> is amazing, or the other way around. You can also make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> going first sometimes. If you have Giant Rex in your hand and you have <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> in your hand is you can normal summon Giant Rex and then us Foolish Burial to send <a data-name=""Glow-Up Blub"">Glow-Up Blub</a> and use Glow-Up Blubs effect to send one card from your deck to grave to special summon himself. Then you can go into Naturia Beast which is basically a win condition going first since he stops all spells plus you'd have UCT. There are other ways to make Naturia Beast first turn like using Double Evolution Pill and using Giant Rex in your hand as material plus another card and get UCT and then special summon Giant Rex then you can normal summon Glow-Up Blub from your hand to get Naturia Beast.

Better going second, but is fine with going first. ","This is an old deck, I'll admit. But I've tried experimenting for zoodiacs to go aggro as quick as possible, and even with a high spell count, it seems to work almost all the time. The main focus is to get either Broarbow with a ton of zoodiacs on him for direct attacks, or Anything else with protection from the mirror forces and their effects. Drident is used more of an end-game sort of card, to clear the field to attack. Overall, I really found this deck to be fun! Only edits, Maybe take out some jar of greeds for raigeki and dark hole, maybe some Xyz agents for an extra finish."

As I learn more and more, I hope to keep the deck constantly updated.  A few combos that could be exploited in this deck: <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> can send  <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> to the GY to draw 2 cards, them revive with <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a>. Normal Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a> using its effect, allowing for an Xyz Summon. If that Xyz Monster would be destroyed, <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a> can be banished for a 1-time escape.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> can send <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> to the GY, and once there Special Summons itself, and search out for <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a>. With it on the field, you can Normal Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a> to Special Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> from the GY, for an Xyz Summon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a> can be activated in order to Special Summon 2 <a data-name=""Photon Token"">Photon Token</a>s, and with them you can Special Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a>. This also leaves you a Normal Summon, and with <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a>, you can Normal Summon it in order to Xyz Summon.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  I'm afraid these are the only combos I could find, but best of luck to anyone that tries out the deck, and let me know what you think of it!"
