It uses the Artifact engine and the Psy-frame engine with an emphasis on going first, but can easily switch to a going second variant using the side deck.

- Monsters (25)

Fluffal Dog x3: It searches any fluffal monster you need to continue your combos

Fluffal Penguin x3: Mostly used either as a special summon from toy vendor or as a fusion material to draw more, it allows you to make Bahamut Shark going first along with Dolphin, gets recycled by Toadally Awesome, and make link plays with bahamut or the special summon it gives you with it's first effect.

Fluffal Dolphin x1: It makes Bahamut Shark with Penguin, and allows Foolish Burial Goods to become a one card combo starter. Sending Toy Vendor to the GY from Deck, then normal summoning Dolphin to set Toy Vendor from the GY and send wing to the GY. His second effect rarely is used.

Fluffal Bear x2: Search Toy Vendor, our main advantage generating engine. Run at 3 because we want to have Toy Vendor as often as possible, I have cut it to 2 to reduce the card count to 40.

Fluffal Wing x1: Allows you to pop Toy Vendor by banishing itself and another fluffal from the GY, allowing you to draw 2 cards and search one from the destroyed vendor, it's only run at 1 because you rarely use it's effect more than once per duel, altho you can send Suture Rebirth to the GY and return it from the banished zone if needs be against grindy decks, that is why Suture Rebirth is in the side deck.

Fluffal Owl x1: Searches Polymerization (which is already easily searchable), it's second effect becomes live against Prohibition or any spell locking card allowing you to fusion without a spell.

Fluffal Sheep x1: Combo Extender, Special summons itself for link plays, if you search it from Dog and have Edge Imp Chain in hand, you can use it to send Dog back to hand, special Chain, make a link 2 and get chain's search effect.

Fluffal Cat x1: the other combo extender, has more uses going 2nd than first, but when going first can still allow you to put 2 fusions on board, either to make VFD or Dingirsu.

Edge Imp Sabres x1: Only at 1 because it is easily recycled by it's effect, it's used to make Tiger against backrow heavy decks, to link climb, overall a great card.

Edge Imp Chains x3: When sent to the GY from the hand or field, allows you to search a frightfur card. Most of the time used to search Frightfur Fusion for our XYZ plays, or Frightfur Patchwork to setup next turn.

Edge Imp Scythe x3: Our archetypal handtrap, can end the opponent's turn with a well placed destruction by summoning Frightfur Cruel Whale, allows us to use our artifact during the opponent's turn, and also protects our fusion monsters from destruction by banishing itself from the GY (most of the time used when Cruel Whale is the only monster on your field when you summon it)

Artifact Scythe x1: One copy, searchable by Dagda, Destroyable by Frightfur Cruel Whale with Edge Imp Scythe. Locking our opponent from the Extra Deck sometimes ends their turn here and there.

Psy-frame Gear Gamma x3: Our other handtrap, here to protect us from handtraps.

Psy-frame Driver x1: Just one copy to make Gamma live, can be summoned from the GY even when sent there by Toy Vendor.

- Spells (15)

Polymerization x3: Our fusion spell, nothing more to say.

Frightfur Fusion x1: Just one copy, easily searchable, using it to fusion summon a fusion monster by banishing from GY allows us to easily make rank 8 or 9 plays.

Frightfur Patchwork x3: Searches both Poly and an Edge Imp monster, fantastical to make even bad hand live.

Foolish Burial Goods x3: One card combo started, used to send Toy Vendor to the GY and making us search a fluffal monster or sabres, often than not you search Dolphin out of it, or Dog.

Toy Vendor x3: Most important card in the deck ? It's drawing effect can either make or break your turns, but it's search effect upon being sent to the GY is just too good.

Frightfur Repair x1: Sent to the GY with Frightfur Cruel Whale second effect. You never use the spell's first effect, but the second one allows you to extend your combos.

Instant Fusion x1: Used to bring out Winda while protecting her with Dingirsu in turn 1, often via Anaconda.

&nbsp;

Extra deck (15)

Frightfur Cruel Whale x2: amazing card, on summon it destroys a card on both fields, non targetted, has a quick effect to send a frightfur card to the GY from either the main deck (Frightfur Repair) or the extra deck to boost the attack of a frightfur monster, you often use it's first effect to pop either scythe or toy vendor.

True King of All Calamities x1: Made from 2 Cruel Whales on first turn to stop the opponent from playing on his turn.

Frightfur Sabre-Tooth x1: Boosts all frightfur monsters' attack and on fusion, revives a frightfur fusion monster, giving us options for XYZ plays or just pushing for OTK. If fusion summoned with 3 materials, can't be destroyed by battle or effect.

Frightfur Kraken x1: Once upon a time it was our best fusion, now slightly outclassed by Cruel Whale, his non destruction effect is still tremenduous, and going second can easily lead to OTKs with his double attack. Using him to summon Sabre-Tooth allows us to reuse his card removal effect a second time, followed up by either an OTK or an XYZ 8 play. Him plus Sabretooth gives you just 8000 attack.

Frightfur Daredevil x1: Newly addded Beatstick, I've found myself using him more and more for the burn damage to push for the win. Can still be replaced with a third Cruel Whale or any other frightfur fusion if you don't like him, i've grown quite fond of him however.

Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star x1: Made from Kraken and Sabre-tooth, gives us a 3rd non destruction removal (but untargeted unlike kraken's) when going second, and when going first, protects Winda from Instant Fusion's destruction effect.

Frightfur Wolf x1: Often used via Frightfur Fusion by banishing our whole GY to have a 2k beater attacking a crazy lots of times.

Frightfur Tiger x1: On summon, destroys cards up to the number of materials used in it's summon, used to clear backrows.

Bahamut Shark x1: Made from Penguin and Dolphin, allows us to summon Toadally Awesome as a way to stop Nibiru during our turn, or just annoy the opponent on his.

Toadally Awesome x1: See above.

Cross-Sheep x1: Most often used for the fusion effect to extend our plays, he is the primary card enabling us to summon Bahamut Shark and Toadally.

Predaplant Verte Anaconda x1: Used when going first tu pitch Instant Fusion to make El Shaddoll Winda as a floodgate.

El Shaddoll Winda x1: Still a good floodgate nowadays when backed up by Dingirsu.

Artifact Dagda x1: Part of the Artifact engine to put out Scythe ready to be popped out by Cruel Whale on the opponent's turn.

&nbsp;

On turn 1, your goal usually is to put out a mix of whichever you can put between VFD, Toadally Awesome, and Dingirsu/Winda.

In order to get VFD, you usually need 1 Fluffal monster, 1 Edge imp monster (most often chain), and a Polymerization with a Frightfur Fusion (which can be searched if using Chain as material). Use Polymerization with the monsters to summon the first whale, then search/use Frightfur Fusion and summon a second Whale by banishing the mats for the first fusion from the GY and overlay both whales to make VFD after using their effect to send Frightfur Patchwork to the GY from the deck to extend your potential plays.

If you summon Dagda and have Edge Imp Scythe in hand with another fluffal (penguin if possible), you can still lock the opponent from using the Extra deck by summoning Cruel Whale during the enemy turn. His destruction effect becomes CL 1, on that, use it's second effect as CL 2 to send Frightfur Repair to the GY, and use Dagda as CL 3 to set Artifact Scythe from the deck, so the opponent can't Cosmic Cyclone it as it will be set and destroyed in the same chain.

To summon Dingirsu, you'd need either 2 Polymerization or 1 Polymerization and Fluffal Cat,  an Edge Imp Monster (and 2 fluffals if not using cat) in order polymerize a Kraken, then use Kraken to polymerize Sabretooth with another monster which will then revive Kraken, and overlay both for Dingirsu (which nets you 3 non destruction removal if you do it going second by using kraken's effect after each time you summon him and with Dingirsu). If you have the required extender, you can then summon Predaplant Verte Anaconda and use it to copy Instant Fusion for a Winda as a floodgate, which will NOT be destroyed at the end phase thanks to Dingirsu, then during the opponent's turn, Winda can also survive an attack thanks again to Dingirsu (let it die at the end of the opponent's end phase to not gimp yourself tho)

Going second, you probably can scoop, but Kraken and Sabre-tooth will be the backbone of your plays. Most of the side deck is geared towards going second in a bo3.

Droll and Lock Bird is probably the best Handtrap in the meta against the top tier decks, able to single handedly force them to end their turns.

Lancea can be searched with the Dagda/Cruel Whale Combo if needed be to also stop them from playing their full combo.

Nibiru the Rock Jhonson is Nibiru, always useful.

Forbidden Droplet is the board breaking spell by excellence, i'd also run Lightning Storm but I don't have them (yet).

Harpie's Feather Duster for backrow heavy decks alongside Tiger.

Frightfur Reborn is against those stall decks, in order to get a second use of Fluffal Wing by banishing the spell from the GY to return Wings to the GY.

The last 3 fusions are here because I had nothing to replace them with yet.

The deck can definitely steal some wins here and there, and if you enjoy combo decks i'm sure you'll enjoy this deck too, you can most of the time play through one handtrap (depends which one of course), the Toy Vendor engine makes the deck quite good at cycling through the deck and the games usually are quick. Also Fluffals are cute."

Also the backup plan is Amina beatdown.","For my submission to the Yu-Gi-Oh spooky deck competition, I thought of the scariest thing I could, the inevitability of death. I decided against that idea at first because stall decks are lame as hell. Looking at my deck now you may be thinking that I am a horrible hypocrite, playing mine when I said stall was lame, however, there is one card that instills fear into the hearts of every man. Mystic Mine. But I thought that that may discredit the deck so I strayed away from using it too often. I found out later, that it facilitated my plays extremely well. I don't feel like I must explain the horror of getting hit by a meteor and of the other obvious cards, so now we will go into the ""strategy"" involved.

&nbsp;

<span>Inferno Tempest</span>

Mill. Mill. Mill. That is the name of the game when you play this deck, at least most of the time. The best play to make when you have this titular card is to tribute an opponent's monster into a 3000+ attack Kaiju then destroy your own 0 attack monster with it to activate the spell's effect. After all of the banishing, the Necrofaces activate, milling your opponent some more. If you have a Left Arm, you want to go for this card. To help you get to this card, we have a few stall items such as the Mystic Mine, and if you are in the<strong> DIREST OF STRAITS</strong>, you use a Kaiju and then go into Relinquished Anima to snatch up the Kaiju and gain the attack to just punch their face. The side deck is something you can choose on your own, find what you would enjoy for the deck. This is by no means to be taken as anything remotely viable and is just a fun casual deck."

Have fun making combo","I recently picked up Prank-Kids, and have fallen in love with the deck! Prank-Kids are a combo deck which can make some impressive end boards in 1-2 turns!

Prank-Kids have 16 one card combos, and can set up a double <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki, and possibly Abyss Dweller/Apollousa/Accesscode turn one. </a>

They can survive for quite awhile, but are extremely weak against Ash Blossom and other handtraps (cough* Nibiru *cough). The deck is highly vulnerable to backrow, so watch out for backrow heavy decks.

If you'd like to know the main combo for the deck feel free to check out Therarely's Prank-Kids Deck Guide: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/deck-guide-connecting-your-prank-kids/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/deck-guide-connecting-your-prank-kids/</a> which helped build the deck better than I had done previously!

I hope you enjoy playing Prank-Kids!"

Samurai Destroyer","If you know how to use SuperHeavy Samurais, then you're set. Basically, Superheavy Samurais can attack while in defense mode and their defense points act as their attack points. Providing good defense for a good offense.
But if you need something that'll help your duel by attacking in attack mode, Samurai Destroyer will help you out without fail.

Note: Superheavy Samurais effects work best when you don't have spells and/or traps in your graveyard. In this deck, I added Sekka's Light. Knowing it works like Pot Of Greed, its additional effect will be able to banish itself so your graveyard is clear and you can be able to use Superheavy Samurai monsters effects without worry. However, using Sekka's Light means you cannot activate spell or trap cards yourself. Here's why, Warlord Susanowo's effect allows you to take spells or traps from your opponents graveyard and place them on your field so you can use them yourself, but if you used Sekka's Light at the start, Warlord Susanowo's effect would be useless and it'll cramp your Spell/Trap Card Zone which are needed for the Superheavy Samurai Soul cards. So use Sekka's Light if you need to gain an advantage and you're good."

Es sencillo: Tus monstruos se invocan de manera especial si los descartas al cementerio, así que disponen de una gran baza de cartas para hacerlo y llenar muy rápido la mesa de monstruos atacando con todo lo que tienen.

Whatever you open with, try to forge a clear path to a field of big monsters.  A good opening card is Starliege Seyfert since you can use it thin your deck by one card and still get Striker Dragon out, which then leads to more shenanigans with Rokkets in general."

Not much to say really, just try and bust out draw of fate some times, I guess.

Be careful when using the Solemn cards as they might weaken you too much.

Also, I might not have added enough defense cards :/

You could also use Exodius, if necessary."

This deck combines the offensive/recursive power of ""Shiranui"" with the oppressive con","This is my own personal decklist that combines the offensive/recursive power of ""Shiranui"" with the oppressive control that ""Zombie World Lock"" offers. I thought I'd release this list for Halloween for the festivities. :)

The <strong>main strategy</strong> of this deck is to establish the ""Zombie World Lock"" board.  While Zombie World + Rivalry of Warlords ensures that your opponent only controls only one monster on their field, Doomking Balerdroch allows a negate + banish once per turn. To achieve this board, Zombie World + Doomking have to be present on the field. This ideal board primarily falls to the crux combo piece Uni-Zombie. Uni-Zombie almost single-handedly achieves this end board by milling zombies from the hand or deck (Necroworld Banshee for Zombie World) (Glow-Up Bloom for Doomking), in addition to providing synchro access. The primary ways to search out Uni-Zombie is through Shiranui Solitaire, and Shiranui Solitaire can also be accessed by Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story.

The <span><strong>Non-Archetypal Zombies</strong></span> add some muscle into this deck through their various interactions with big Daddy Doomking:

<strong>Jack-O-Bolan</strong> is a free summon which helps mill your hand to your graveyard for plays. It provides a quick effect monster reborn once per turn, which also trigger Doomking's banishment effect - resulting in an interruption and a extra zombie on board.

<strong>Vampire Fraulein</strong> is a zombie battlephase handtrap that summons itself when an attack is declared, allowing Doomking to banish during the battlephase. It also adds up to +3000 ATK/DEF to any zombie monster on the field, once per battle (for the cost of lifepoints), turning any zombie into a massive beatstick.

(Link 2)<strong> Vampire Sucker</strong> provides more resources to a zombie player by giving the player a free draw anytime a zombie is resurrected from either graveyard. During the standby phase, if Doomking is in the graveyard and there is a Field Spell on the board, it will resurrect itself, which prompts Vampire Sucker's +1 draw effect (chain link 1) and Doomking's banishment effect (chain link 2). Drawing one card and banishing another on the field/graveyard in the standby phase is often devastating. Often in the first turn, Doomking + another zombie is linked away for Vampire Sucker to allow for this chain to occur during your opponent's standby phase.

<strong>Non-archtypal synchros</strong> are also useful in this deck. For unprepared decks, , (LVL12 Synchro)<strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> is invincible since it is unaffected by card effects while in the EMZ (this card is easy to bring out by synchroing a level 4 uni-zombie with a (level 8) Doomking, and Doomking returns in opponent's standby phase.) , (LVL7 Synchro)<strong>F.A Dawn Dragster</strong> is a OPT S/T negate. , (LVL8 Synchro)<strong>Draco Berserker</strong> punishes every effect used by the opponent by with banishement and (LVL8 Synchro)<strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> is banished pile recursion and interruption.

<strong><span>Non-Archetypal Spell/Traps:</span></strong>

<strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong> - Triggers every maindeck Shiranui banishment effect. (Solitaire = Resurrection from banished pile) ( Samurai = Recovery from graveyard) (Spiritmaster = 1 pop).

<strong>Monster Reborn</strong> - Pretty straightforward. Also trigger's Vampire Sucker's effect.

<strong>Pot of Desires</strong> - +2 draw for 10 cards banished face-down. Remember Shiranui monsters banished facedown don't trigger their effects! Careful about using this card too much, it may banish too many combo pieces.

<strong>Terraforming/Metavers</strong>e - Access to Zombie World.
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><strong>Rivalry of Warlords</strong> - Forces both players to only control 1 type of monster.When they Summon any monster, Zombie World changes that monsters type to Zombie. Rivalry of Warlord's will prevent that player from attempting to summon any other monster that is not a Zombie Type monster. Therefore, unless the opponent is playing a zombie deck, they cannot summon from their hand, deck, or extra deck if they have zombies on their field. Zombie World + Rivalry of Warlords + Doomking Balerdroch makes a very difficult to break board. This card cannot be searched in this deck, only drawn.</p>
<strong>Super Polymerization</strong> becomes a very powerful board breaker/interruption with zombie world, as almost any monster on the field can be fused away for <strong>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>. <strong>Mudragon</strong> and <strong>Starving Venom Dragon</strong> are also Super Poly targets.

<strong><span>The Shiranui portion of the deck provides various helpful effects for the deck:</span></strong>

<strong> Shiranui Solitaire</strong> allows more ready access to the ""ZWorld Lock"" board, by searching Uni-Zombie from deck. Solitaire also allows for recursion from the banished pile by reborning any banished Shiranui (except itself) when the card is banished.

<strong>Shiranui Samurai</strong> is a one of, since it's searchable and isn't a combo piece. It's main strength is it's quick effect, allowing Doomking to trigger it's effect anytime during the opponent's turn. It can also out monsters that are hard to get rid of through it's banishment effect. It's also recursion as it allows graveyard recovery when it's banished.

<strong> Shiranui Spiritmaster</strong> allows for a target destruction of a card on the field anytime it's banished face-up with cards such as Shiranui Samurai, Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash, Gold Sarcophagus, etc.

<strong>Shiranui Spectralsword</strong> can tune in the field and graveyard. Through graveyard synchro, it can cheat out Archfiend Zombie-Skull even without the use of proper materials.

<strong>Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash</strong> is targeted destruction for two monsters in exchange for a zombie tribute, and it also banishes a Shiranui from deck, triggering their effects. If Shiranui Spiritmaster is banished, 3 cards on the field are destroyed. (+ it sounds like a special move from Demon Slayer lol, extra cool points)

<strong>Ghost Meets Girl, a Shiranui's Story</strong> provides extra access to combo pieces since it searches out Shiranui Solitaire which in turns accesses Uni-Zombie.

<strong>Shiranui Extra Deck</strong> monsters are this deck's main offensive juggernauts - (LVL5 Synchro) <strong>Swordsaga</strong> changes battle position, (LVL7 Synchro) <strong>Squiresaga</strong> provides non-targeting destruction, (LVL8 Synchro) <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> boosts it own attack on summon for OTKs, and <strong>Sunsaga/Skillsaga</strong> provide blanket protection, destruction and recovery.

While this deck is strong and semi-consistent going first, it doesn't do well to interruptions, negates and handtraps. If Uni-Zombie is somehow negated, the turn usually ends there. This deck also has difficulty breaking boards, as it doesn't have much tools to do so.

All in all, this deck is a fun rogue strategy to play, semi-budget, and easy to learn. Have fun and Happy Halloween duelists!"

","<blockquote>
<p><span><em>""So I have a few plans with this deck.""</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>
<span>Plan 1</span>:
<h1><span><em><strong>(Dark Magician Loop)</strong></em></span></h1>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div>With this first plan it's to try and go for the Dark Magician's <strong>(DM)</strong> with, Dark Magical Circle <strong>(Circle)</strong> &amp; Eternal Soul <strong>(Soul)</strong> ,to try to go for the <span>Banish</span> loop every turn with destroying <strong>DM</strong> and revivng him with with <strong>Soul</strong> and into the <span>banish</span> with<strong> Circle</strong>. If you dont have cards in hand just cycle through with Magicican's Souls <strong>(MGS')</strong> and or, Magician's Rod <strong>(MR)</strong>, Soul Servant <strong>(SS)</strong>, Illusion Magic<strong> (IM)</strong> or even Apprentice Illusion Magician <strong>(AIM)</strong>. With the Deck you have plenty of search for <strong>DM</strong> I think more than enough to get any combo off.</div></blockquote>
<p>If there are any road blocks on the field, its pretty easy to get rid of them when you have <strong>DM</strong> on the field with cards such as the Dark Burning Magic <strong>(DBM)</strong>, and with the <strong>Soul</strong>, <strong>Circle</strong> combo on the field.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<span>Plan 2</span>:
<h2><span><em><strong>(WindWitches)</strong></em> </span></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div>This plan is to try and get out <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> out on the field with the Windwitch engine. The <span>special summon</span> <strong>(<span>Ss</span>)</strong> Windwitch - Ice Bell <strong>(Ice Bell)</strong> into Windwitch - Glass Bell <strong>(Glass Bell)</strong> into Both<strong> Ice Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Glass Bell's</strong> effects. First Reducing oppents life by 500 giving the slight <span>burn</span> to your opponent using <strong>Ice Bell</strong> &amp; with <strong>Glass Bell</strong> getting  Windwitch Snow Bell <strong>(Snow Bell)</strong> into your hand.</div></blockquote>
<p>With <strong>Snow Bell</strong> in hand you can<strong> Ss Snow Bell</strong> onto the field through <strong>Snow Bells</strong> effect allowing it to be <span><strong>Ss</strong></span> to the field if you have 2 or more Wind Monsters, and no non-wind mosters; you can <span><strong>Ss</strong></span> from your hand to the field. With that set you can then Tune <strong>Glass Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Ice Bell</strong> into either the Clear Wing Synchro Dragon <strong>(Clear Wing)</strong> or the  Windwitch - Winter Bell <strong>(Winter Bell)</strong> .</p>
<p>Personally 90% of the time I will go into <strong>Winter Bell</strong>, because most of the time you are not keeping this part of the component long. With <strong>Winter Bell</strong> on the field activating its effect (Target 1 Windwitch monster in your GraveYard <strong>(GY)</strong> and inflict damage to your oppoent equal to that target's Level x200 during the battle phase).</p>
<p><span>Most</span> the time I only use this effect. I usually Target the <strong>Glass Bell</strong> dealing the most effective amont of Damage to my opponet's life points giving them another slight <span>burn</span>.  After all that you can then Tune <strong>Snow Bell</strong> &amp; <strong>Winter Bell</strong> (or <strong>Clear Wing</strong>, if you decide to go down that path) together to summon <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong>. Once you have <strong>Crystal Wing</strong> out on the field, its usually a good enough wall of defence, attack and negates that it can help you in all stages of the match. I feel this combo is fairly effective when its pulled off.</p>
<p>When its not pulled off its a shame but I feel when you have cards such as<strong> Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermance</strong> in deck it helps negate most things that will stop you from pulling the combo off. But if there is too much struggle I have throw into the Side Deck the <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>, <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong>, and <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> to help with flexability.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<span>Plan 3</span>:
<h3><span><em><strong>(Dragun of Red-Eyes)</strong></em></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div> Now this is the cheese king overlord so all you need for this plan is to as the tital say's. Get <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> out onto the field. I have made it so there are a few ways of achiving this goal. First is the 2<strong> Keeper of Dragon Magic's</strong>, If the card is normal or <span>Special Summoned</span>: You can discard 1 card; and add 1 Polymerization or Fusion Spell from deck to hand and reveal 1 fusion Monster (Being the <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> in this case) in the extra deck; <span>Ss</span> 1 of the fusion materials listed from that monster from the <strong>GY</strong> in face-down defence postion.</div></blockquote>
<p>But once you have done that, the Spell card you are after is 90% of the time <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong>. You want to instantly pop this when there are no negates on the field and just summon<strong> Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> right out.</p>
<p>Other ways of Summoning <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> is to Link Summon PredaPlant Verte Anaconda (<strong>Verte</strong>) by having to effect monsters on the field and tributing them for <strong>Verte</strong>. Then popping <strong>Verte's</strong> Effect, to target 1 face-up monster on the field; it becoming Dark until the end of the current turn this effect is activated, then Paying 2000 Lp and sending a Fusion or Poly from the deck to the <strong>GY</strong> then the effect of the spell activates.</p>
<p>So you will usually use it to search for <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> to Summon <strong>Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><em>""So there are 3 Simple combo's I use in this deck, there are a few more, but im sure most people could figure it out"". </em></span></p>
<p><span><em>""Have fun ggwp"" ~Buzm</em></span></p>

(Watch the video for news on my 2021 video series)","

I found out from YouTube that <em>Godzilla VS King Kong</em> is going to air in 2021, assuming nothing goes wrong. And for the past few weeks, if not months, I have been getting back into Godzilla; I used to be a big fan back in middle school. So I made this Dinosaur Kaiju deck, named ""Godzilla March"", after Godzilla's iconic theme song.

&nbsp;

Because of the Kaiju engine here, going second is more important than ever for Dinos. Interrupted Kaiju Slumber is one of the best cards in the deck, not just because it turns the tables if your opponent has multiple strong monsters on board, but because it works surprisingly well with Lost World. With Kaiju Slumber, you can give yourself a Dogoran and your opponent any other Kaiju, and Dogoran will be stronger, since the opponent's Kaiju is not a Dinosaur. Plus, you can do this before your Normal Summon so that your opponent will get a Juraegg Token and they can't target any non-tokens with card effects.

&nbsp;

Slumber also has synergy with Lost World because you can use it while the opponent has a Juraegg Token to pop a Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon, and then search an Oviraptor. And one last thing about this deck? Because Animadorned Archosaur is Level 1, the Extra Deck has 2 Relinquished Anima in there. If you are able to summon it, then summon a Kaiju to your opponent's field in the zone Anima points to, so that Anima can equip it.

&nbsp;

As for the Side Deck, it contains 3 copies of cards that are all useful in the current meta. So if you're playing against a high-tier deck and it's time to get serious, just switch out the Kaiju cards for those.

Fortunately <em>Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor </em>and <em>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari </em>came off the banlist, with these two back to 3, the deck will now be able to compete again with most of the meta decks.

Handtraps Explanation:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - I've observed that most decks right now are abusing <em>Halqifibrax</em>, this card can easily change the flow of the game to your favor against those type of decks.</li>
 	<li><em>Ghost Ogre &amp;  Snow Rabbit</em> - Since Numeron is still a thing here in TCG, it will be wise to put this in the main deck just to be sure. Although you can still use this against some of your opponent's key card in order to interrupt their combo.</li>
 	<li><em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> - I've noticed that most of the combo decks will not be bothered when you use <em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em> to them, so instead I've come to a decision that this handtrap will have a much more impact to your opponent's combo.</li>
 	<li><em>Effect Veiler</em> - Self Explanatory handtrap. Most of you will say that <em>Infinite Impermanence</em> will be a better choice but since we have a <em>Selene</em> in the Extra Deck, this monster will be more useful overall.</li>
</ul>
Most of the Spell Cards are pretty much standard except <em>Sky Striker Maneuver - Scissors Cross</em>, I put this card in the Main Deck since <em>Dragoon</em> is a thing. This card can out your opponent's <em>Dragoon</em>, though that's not the effect that I use it most for. The thing that I like about this card is it helps me fill up my GY with Spell Cards faster.

Extra Deck is pretty much standard except the <em>Link Spider</em>. You can use this card against Dino especially if they use <em>Lost World</em>, that card can lowkey shut down Sky Striker. Good thing we have this card to remove the token from our main monster zone.

Side Deck Explanation:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - Good against combo deck. Side it in if your opponent greatly relies on combo and if they don't have that much extender or bait cards.</li>
 	<li><em>Dinowrestler Pankratops</em> - Can pop your opponent's card and it's a free summon monster.</li>
 	<li><em>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</em> - If you think <em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> is not a good choice against your opponent, side this in instead.</li>
 	<li><em>Dark Ruler No More</em> - Good card to break your opponent's board. If you think that your <em>Nibiru</em> will just get negated or baited, side this in instead.</li>
 	<li><em>Cosmic Cyclone</em> - Good against Altergeist and other backrow decks. This card will prevent the Altergeist's grind ability.</li>
 	<li><em>Mystic Mine</em> - If you think your match will come to a grind one, side this in so that your opponent's pace will slow down.</li>
 	<li><em>Evenly Matched</em> - Self Explanatory card. Use this with Dark Ruler No More and your opponent's face will be shocked.</li>

Main Attribute, Type: Dark, Zombie

The primary strategy of the deck is to go first and lock down the field though the use of Zombie World, Balerdroch, Vampire Domination, and other Floodgates. Super Poly and it's respective Extra Deck targets are used as additional pieces of disruption when going first, or board removal tools if forced to go second. The wincon of the deck tends to come from the Rivalry/Zombie World lock backed up by Balerdroch and an Extra Deck boss monster of your choice. Additional copies of Vampire Domination and Domain can be cut in order to fit in any combination of the various zombie support cards available (Allure of Darkness is a possible option but beware, as a handful of your monsters are not the Dark attribute)."

Combos included! ,"<span>This is my latest Infernoble knight build and I think it is very consistent. Infernoble Knight is a tier 1 deck, being able to adapt to the current metagame and play through the ‘powerhouse handtraps’ such as gamma, imperm, nibiru and even droll and lock bird (this one requires a good hand). Playing 60 cards in Infernoble knight is absolutely necessary to avoid drawing bricks such as too many equip spells, combo tuners etc. For this build I am mainly focusing on playing NIBIRU PROOF, that would either be playing around nibiru or playing through it. I have included combos for both in my NIBIRU PROOF Infernoble knight combos, I recommend that you check it out - you can watch some combos and learn how to play the deck better and improve as a player. If you do, please like the video and subscribe to the channel - it is a great way to support me and the channel. I will now go over what cards we need in hand and what the end boards are going to be in all the combos I show in my video. Also if you are interested in doing so - you may check out my other uploads on YGOPROdeck, I have uploaded a dragon link and 2 Eldlich decks and I have youtube videos explaining those as well, link to those can be found in the YGOPROdeck of those. If you have any questions regarding the deck, let me know in the comments below or the comments you youtube. Good luck and have fun!</span>

This deck has a focus of getting an OTK on your opponent, the Dogmatika stuff is there because it's also a LIGHT attribute deck that prefers going second.

Couple that with a handful of handtraps and that alone can be enough to slow down current meta decks on a good day.</span>

<span>Similar can be said about Zexal Turbo Numeron. Number S0: Utopic Zexal can lock you opponent down for a turn but he's weak during your turn and falls to Gamma and Infinite Impermanence. Still, with the right amount of handtraps you just might be lucky enough to win.</span>

<span>Ideally you make your Numeron plays and then switch Numeron Gate for Generaider Boss Stage. During your opponents Draw Phase you summon Harr from your deck or, if Harr is in hand, summon Dovelgus and then chain his effect on his summon, tributing himself to summon Harr from hand. DON'T activate Zexal in the same chain. Once Harr is on the board you then proceed to activate Zexal's effect. Now if your opponent tries to activate Psy-Framegear Gamma or Infinite Impermanence you can negate that with Harr.</span>

<span>Also don't forget to make use of Harr's second effect (which they wrote down first because who reads cards all the way to the end, yet I still keep forgetting about this effect) to force your opponent to send a monster from their hand or field to the GY if they add a card to their hand from their deck except for their normal draw.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Quickly some card choices explained:</span>

<span>1# Effect Veiler can be swapped for Infinite Impermanence (Less of a card choice and more of a budget thingy)</span>

<span>2# No Memories of Hope. Albeit drawing 4 cards sounds incredible (realistically speaking 3 cards as you're trying to play around Nibiru. Numeron Gate 4 exists only to OTK) both archetypes don't require you to throw your entire hand to establish a board and therefore don't rely on draw power as much as other decks do. These slots find better use in handtraps.</span>

<span>3# No World Legacy Monstrosity/Trias Hierachia/Girsu Mekk-Knight. These cards are incredible in pure Generaider to summon V.F.D. turn 1 while also giving you an extra interruption/draw power with Trias but they don't add much practicality in a hybrid deck with less slots to spare.</span>

<span>4# Cyber Dragon Nova &amp; Invoked Mechaba. You can fill these 2 ED slots as you like but I've been running into so many Dogmatika engines lately (and the only out to Winda would be Loptr's effect allowing to resolve) so I decided to skip the Side Deck and move them to the Extra Deck right away.</span>

<span>5# Generaider Boss Room. I added one copy of this card to search off of Mardel if you already have access to Generaider Boss Stage. This card is an omni negate if your opponents effect is chained to the activation of your Generaider card or effect. (Boss Room doesn't <em>really</em> negate the effect but rather changes the effect to both players drawing a card which can be advantageous to you but also to your opponent, so keep that in mind) </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Now go forth and get your game on.</span>"

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士しEnseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warrior's Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"". They are a sub-series of the ""Noble Knight"" archetypes, and as such are closely related to ""Noble Arms"", in addition to the ""Roland"" archetype.

The Level 10 materials for XYZ are: Obelisk from a True Name, Exodius via its own condition, Metal Reflect Slime with a possible stop at Egyptian god slime now that that's a thing, and Accel (sending Quickdraw to up its level) made out of Deep Sea Diva and Gishki Diviner. From there you have a simple choice of Number XX, Gustav into Liebe, Galaxy Destroyer. Accel and Quickdraw can also make a Cyber Dragon Infinity.

Plays with Reckless Summon are for Diva into triple Diviner for draw 3 and Trish Zero, or for triple quickdraw into CDI and maybe a Chevalier De Fleur for the extra negate.

The card calling is mostly True Name for the quick Obelisk, or Sphere Mode if your opponent has troublesome cards that need to be cleared. Diviner and Archfiend's Oath can generate extra cards in hand, especially with Oath being a soft once per turn. Convulsion, Card Advance, Spellbook Organization, and Diviner can be used for either a peek at the card before it's called or even a top of deck fix before calling."

We run every Infernoid and as much R4NK and self-mill as possible to fill the Graveyard and fuel big Infernoid plays.

Pros:
- Lots of Extra Deck flexibility with the R4NK toolbox
- Lots of board-breaking potential with the big Infernoids
- Tons of explosive draws such as Reasoning, Soul Charge, and Instant Fusion

Cons:
- Heavily reliant on RNG mills
- Can struggle to actually OTK due to the level restrictions of the Infernoids
- Can have some difficulty grinding due to the highlander nature of the deck"

Most of the decks were either incomplete or just used this as a support archetype. I can tell you this deck should NEVER be a support archetype. This deck not only is a field swarm deck, it is also a card game INSIDE OF A CARD GAME.

There is really no one strategy for this deck. The only things you have to watch out for when playing with this deck is your Tuners. That goes without being said for any Synchro deck, however there are scenarios where I've accidentally had 3 different Tuners out at a time.

Most of the time this deck has a plan B, C, and D when playing with it. There is always a way to recover or stall until your next turn."

Making a comeback from the 5Ds era, a combination of the Synchron Extreme Structure Deck cards with the 5Ds Legendary Collection gives access to a huge pool of cards for spamming Synchros.

Pros:
- Has many hands that can break through boards when going second as easily as it builds boards going first
- Very high ceiling including both handlooping and negates from Shooting Quasar
- Lots of high powered bombs that can be drawn into semi-consistently

Cons:
- Combos are very complex and can be difficult to learn
- If your board is broken there is a very low chance of recovery
- Due to the necessity for a high density of extenders, you don't have a lot of room for generic cards"

Main Attribute, Type: Various, Wyrm

The main strategy of the deck is to go first and hopefully end on a normal monster (Berserker of the Tenyi) to activate the effects of Flawless Perfection and Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi, as well as some combination of your other boss monsters (Sahasrara, Calamities, and the Yang-Zing synchros). Vanity's Ruler acts as the deck's primary normal summon to lock down your opponent. On the following turn, attempt to OTK with Draco Berserker and your other high attack Wyrm monsters. The 4 True Kings allow the deck to go into Calamities if need be, however this engine can by cut for other cards such as 3 Mystery Shell Dragon and Nidhogg Generader Boss of Ice."

Laugh about this deck all you want, this deck is coming in with a 80% win rate (approx.). So make sure you all just tell me some feedback as this deck is really something different comapred to some of the other stuff I have been doing.

Here are some sidenotes:
I decided to play the eldich mainly because of synergy with eldich and the blaze accelerator reload. It also has got synergy as the fact is doesn't special summon as much since its a control deck which is why it slowly kills my opponent.

Here is the next deck: Updated Normal Monsters"

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士しEnseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warrior's Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"". They are a sub-series of the ""Noble Knight"" archetypes, and as such are closely related to ""Noble Arms"", in addition to the ""Roland"" archetype.

Floodgates and Blaze accelerator Reload supplement your defensive monsters in order to reduce the size of your opponent's field. The main wincon of the deck is to rack up as much burn damage as possible while board wiping your opponent's monsters through Scattershot's effect. The extra deck primarily focuses on toolbox options and is mostly up to personal preference. 3 Magic Planter can be replaced for other draw cards such as Pot of Extravagance (The extra deck is certainly flexible enough for this inclusion)."

Easy OTK and control/combo deck to pick up.,"Big Brain Salads. This deck brought me to the victory of my recent locals.

Basically, going first you will usually open with a handtrap and some form of other negate. You'll want to get to gazelle as soon as possible and bury the roar or rage from deck to grave, and then recycle it with sunlight wolf.

Going second, ACCESSCODE TALKER is the way to go. Easy OTK and you can do the Update-Transcode combo to get out a 5300 ATK beatstick that can attack twice and can destroy 3 cards on the field."

With 1 other plant in hand, we can easily put 2 interruptions and able to run big staple slot, sounds familiar? Ye","What a year. TCG with combo and OCG with control. Only a deck with big staple slot can survive the format. So we cut all the Rikka extender for more staple slot and starter, except Loptr. With Mardel, Loptr acts the same as Petal making us have 12 starters (3 Loptr, 3 Petal, 3 Glamour, 2/3 Lonefire, and One for One). Combo needs 1 other plant in hand, so it's a 2 cards combo (similar to Zoodiac that needs Ramram in GY). Normal summon the starter, add Snowdrop (can add others like Mudan if you already have Snowdrop), Snowdrop will ss the other plant we have on hand by tributing the starter, and since we only run plant monsters that searches (Mardel, Mudan, Lonefire, Petal), we can easily ss Mudan for Rikka spell/trap like Sheet. Last play is using Snowdrop eff to make all plant lv8 for Teardrop, making us have 2 interruptions with Sheet. In the end you'll realise we only use exactly 2 cards to do the stuff, the negs are covered by the amount of plus from the plants we run.

If going second, any plant extender (One for One, Rose Girl, or the new Ingunar) can result you Fairy Knight Ingunar (board bounce, spell speed 4) since Snowdrop can target Mudan making all plant becomes lv6. Plenty of room for side deck cards too.

Main deck: 12 Starters, 2 Mardel (ensures Loptr resolving, not really a brick since Snowdrop can summon it, and most importantly, plus), 1-2 Snowdrop (the heart and soul, but you don't wanna draw double of this, 2 cus we play Desires), 1-2 Mudan (Sheet grind game, arguably worse than Snowdrop cus Snowdrop makes Teardrop), Rose Girl (or any plant extender, I choose it cus it has recovery, super clutch with Rikka Petal playstyle). The rest is just staples and draw cards for more consistency (Desires similar to Salamangreat, but we run 2 Mudan/Snowdrop while Gazelle is at 1).

Extra Deck: 2 Teardrop (can play 3 if you want since there aint many plant extra deck around, needs 3 Snowdrop tho), Peryton (Snowdrop targets Mardel), Ingunar (3 lv6 mats, explained above), Princessprite (just another plant extra deck we can make, plus if it mills s/t), Jasmine (for link climbing if aint locked to plant), Verte (generic plant link, helps handtrap like Nibiru and Psy-Frame to become plant, can run Super Poly too but too many Dragon Buster lock around), Negalogia (super situational if not plant locked), Halq (we run tuner handtrap, can put Selene too if with Effect Veiler), Link Spider (helps Psy-Frame Driver and Nibiru token for Verte).

Pros: Super consistent, have follow-up, big staple slot.

Cons: Weaker payoff than Zoodiac, prone to handtrap."
