Where the goal is to corrupt your monsters and turn them into mindless drones! We come in peace... or do we...  &nbsp;  The idea behind this deck is to flood the field with ""A"" counters by using <strong><a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a> </strong>so you can take over your opponents' monsters and use them as fodder for your summons. By sending an Alien monster from the deck to the GY you can place counters on an opponent's monster up to the level of the sent monster. The main strategy is to quickly summon Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll and use both of his effects.  &nbsp;  In order to do that, we need to flood the field with Aliens. In order to do that, we need to bring out <strong><a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>. </strong>The effect of M-Frame allows you to distribute ""A"" counters to monsters face up on the field, however you wish. The great thing about this effect is that it specifically says distribute. Meaning you can bypass non-targeting effects, which is a pretty awesome deal.  &nbsp;  From there you can special summon Alien monsters from your GY up to the number of monster's your opponent controls with ""A"" counters. Bring out another Alien from your grave, to then Link Summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</strong></a>. When he is out on the field, monsters with ""A"" counters are switched to defense position and cannot change their position (so long as there are counters on them) also they can no longer activate their effects. That's not all, <strong>Zer'oll</strong> also gives us the ability to add a card that can place ""A"" counters. From here you can pull any number of cards that add ""A"" counters, but this strategy will revolve around adding <strong><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a> </strong>to your hand. Then, using <strong>Zer'oll's</strong> effect, remove 2 ""A"" counters from anywhere on the field to Normal Summon the Kid. Once <strong>Alien Kid</strong> is summoned, any monster your opponent special summons will have an ""A"" counter placed on them. Effectively preventing your opponent from activating effects or declaring an attack.  &nbsp;  I have included a small Reptilianne engine for extenders as well as their Synchro <strong>Reptilianne Melusine</strong>. Her effect can activate every chain which means she can make all of your opponent's monsters attack 0. As I said... Welcome to Area 51, we come in peace...."

""<b>Salamangreat</b>""  is an archetype of FIRE Cyberse monsters  The ""Salmangreat"" monsters have various effects related to battle and <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">GY</a> recursion. A common theme among many of their monsters is they work best when with another monster of the same name. The most simple and powerful example is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Gazelle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a>"" who sends any ""Salamangreat"" card from the Deck to the GY, and can also Special Summon itself from the hand if a ""Salamangreat"" monster is sent to the GY. Many of the archetype's effects also involve shuffling cards from the GY into the Deck, revival and discarding cards, so manipulation of the GY successfully gives the Deck a lot of potential.  A key part of the Deck's combos is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a>"", which allows the player to use a ""Salamangreat"" with the same name as a monster being Link Summoned as the entire material. As with the lesser monsters, the boss monsters get stronger when Summoned using a monster with the same name, making ""Sanctuary"" the quickest and easiest way to open up the full potential of the Deck's Link monsters. It can be searched by ""<a title=""Salamangreat Balelynx"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Balelynx"">Salamangreat Balelynx</a>"" to increase consistency, which makes generic Cyberse monsters like ""<a title=""Lady Debug"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Debug"">Lady Debug</a>"" and ""<a title=""Flame Bufferlo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>"" useful to start combos off.  The main win condition in some builds is to set up a ""<a title=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Violet_Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a>"" Summoned using another copy of itself, which basically guarantees an <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""OTK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/OTK"">OTK</a> if all its effects resolve. The other Extra Deck monsters can be used to support this strategy, or for supporting the Deck's recursion/battle effects. In more conventional builds, ""Violet Chimera"" can simply used with ""<a title=""Fusion of Fire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"">Fusion of Fire</a>"" and ""<a title=""Super Polymerization"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" to break up Link-focused boards, particularly deadly in <a title=""Mirror Match"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mirror_Match"">mirror matches</a>. The Deck's rarely used Ritual Monster ""<a title=""Salamangreat Emerald Eagle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Emerald_Eagle"">Salamangreat Emerald Eagle</a>"" provides a finisher/alternate attacker that can clear all the opponent's Special Summoned monsters if Ritual Summoned using an ""Emerald Eagle"" the player controls, and can sacrifice unneeded Link Monsters to get over tough monsters while inflicting heavy <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Burn"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burn"">Burn</a> damage.  As any modern Deck must, the Spell/Trap lineup of the Deck also has a heavy control element. ""<a title=""Salamangreat Roar"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a>"" is a powerful <a title=""Counter Trap Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Counter_Trap_Card"">Counter Trap Card</a> that can negate any monster effect or Spell/Trap card while you control a ""Salamangreat"" Link Monster, that can Set itself from the GY when a ""Salamangreat"" is self-Link Summoned at the cost of banishing itself when it leaves the field. It can also be recovered by ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a>"", who can also play a key role in grabbing ""<a title=""Fusion of Fire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"">Fusion of Fire</a>"" or other key Spell/Trap cards from the GY, especially ones sent by ""Gazelle"". Many of these like ""<a title=""Will of the Salamangreat"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_the_Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a>"", ""<a title=""Salamangreat Circle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a>"" and ""<a title=""Salamangreat Rage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Rage"">Salamangreat Rage</a>"" get stronger when a self-Summoned Salamangreat Link Monster is present, so maintaining and protecting a powerful monster like ""<a title=""Salamangreat Heatleo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a>"" can reap many rewards, even over a relatively short Duel. ""Sunlight Wolf"" can also recover FIRE monsters from the GY, particularly useful with the staple handtrap ""<a title=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_Blossom_%26_Joyous_Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"". These attributes of repeated recursion allow the Deck to get a lot of value from playing many on-theme 1-ofs, as they will nearly always be accessible when needed.  Finally, a key step in setting up these plays is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a>"", a generic Rank 3 that can Summon any ""Salamangreat"" from the Deck and <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Bounce"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Bounce"">bounce</a> opposing cards on being used as Link Material (Traditional only). An alternative to ""Miragestallio"" is ""<a title=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dante,_Traveler_of_the_Burning_Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>"". As such the Deck works well with generic Rank 3 <a title=""Engine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Engine"">engines</a> such as ""<a title=""Speedroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Speedroid"">Speedroids</a>"", ""<a title=""Danger!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!"">Danger!</a>"" and ""<a title=""Predaplant"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Predaplant"">Predaplants</a>""."

The various synchros can be summoned with Halq or with Deskbot 001, Halq goes into Shooting Riser, whose level is easily manipulatable since we have main deck monsters from 3-5, letting SRD be anywhere from Lv 2-4 for synchro summoning. The Symphonic Warriors and Ice Knights give us extra normal summons so we can save our pendulum summon for reusing our pedulums after they get set to the extra deck, and Hamster and Pendulum XYZ let us get a little extra value out of being a pendulum deck.  Brachion makes us want to go second, and our boss monsters either shred boards (Trish, Trish-Zero) or are powerful negates (Toad, Borrelload Savage,) or both (Infinity, Fleur), so we canuse that and our hand traps to fight through an established board.  Just like in 2017, Dinomists are a cheap, mediocre engine that gets to play a wide variety of powerful but expensive boss monsters."

Nibiru, the Primal Being  for a replace of Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA it wont change the outcome much. it a card to hope for in the first hand and nothing else. i want to put spokky dog in the side for the LP gain so i can live another turn &gt;.&gt; im going to do that in the nexus version since i can't add a link to it &lt;.&lt; you not me. also as writing this im not the best player so it can't hard to write what to do for each deck.......

This deck can play through a bit of hand traps it may not get through a whole hand loop but usually their going to have an abyss dweller which counters some certain decks. Gishkis can have a lot of draw power and get resources really nicely kinda gets somewhat countered if you use something that locks the grave which hurts but it really depends on your hand. I play a bit of impcantation, but overall hieratics with gishkis sync well when your playing atlantean stuff."

(This was due to its last effect, which allowed you to add all of the Adamancipator Tuners, which I agree, is pretty broken.) With the loss of such a powerful defensive utility, Rock Decks were forced to take a new approach that they have been quite good at recently: <em>Beatdown.</em></span>  <strong><span>Best Beatdown Rock Archetypes as of 2021</span></strong>  <span>First of, one of the most significant Rock Archetypes <em>ever</em> would have to be Adamancipators. The Tuners synergize very well with all Rocks, and they can quickly make heavy Synchros such as <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> (mainly the first two, as you have to work a bit for Crystal Wing). (Not to mention it can also function as a Stun Deck if it is integrated with Koa'ki Meiru.) Another significant Rock Archetype that has recently been introduced would be the Fossil Archetype, which is the literal embodiment of beatdown. Being able to Fusion Summon with materials from either Graveyard is excellent (not to mention the rewards you get for using materials from your opponent's Graveyard), and the ace Fusion Monsters are all Battle Phase oriented (the best one being <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a>). The last Rock Archetype that has had some considerable support in 2021 would be Magnet Warriors. Although Magnet Warriors are lacking in removal options, they specialize in mediocre swarming (literally every card in the archetype, except the original 3 Normal Monsters, has an effect to Special Summon something), and while the archetype itself does not explicitly reward the player for getting 5 Level 4 monsters on your opponent's turn, it does open up itself as an engine for other Rock Decks (mainly the aforementioned two). And with the release of the new <a data-name=""Epsilon The Magnet Warrior"">Epsilon The Magnet Warrior</a> (OCG), Magnet Warriors are a very strong going first Archetype due to their somewhat untouchability during the opponent's turn, even without access to <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>.</span>  <span><strong>So... we should start talking about this Deck then</strong></span>  <span>This is an Adamancipator/Fossil Beatdown Deck that uses Magnet Warriors as its main engine (wow, how original) for Synchro material and Fusion Material. The Deck is somewhat balanced in terms of its in-game adaptability, 1) being able to open a strong going first board with Magnet Warriors that gives you a full field and Graveyard set-up on your next turn or 2) being able to establish stable footing for itself going second with Adamancipators and Fossils (since your opponent's Graveyard is most likely already established). Do note that the Deck is very swarm heavy, and because of this it is unfortunately very dependent on careful zone usage and placement (the Link era still leaves its tracks in the mud lol).</span>  <strong><span>Win Condition</span></strong>  <span>The best possible field that could be established with this Deck would be having <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> as your main disruptor, <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Convoy"">Fossil Machine Skull Convoy</a> (to get through walls of big monsters and get that <em>residual damage</em>) or <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a> (it's essentially Blue-Eyes Chaos Max just without the protection), a <a data-name=""Gorgonic Guardian"">Gorgonic Guardian</a> or two (I shouldn't have to explain this), and <a data-name=""Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior"">Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior</a> since it punishes your opponent if they happen to bomb your entire field all at once. (It wouldn't hurt to have a <a data-name=""Magnetic Field"">Magnetic Field</a> out too, but it's a shame it's not SEARCHABLE.)</span>  <span>However, if you want to tie up a match quickly, a funny way to game end is with <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a> and <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> (but that's only if you want to be <em>extra cheeky</em>).</span>"

For the start of the combo, you want to summon 1 level 4 rock monster in your hand, special summon Adamancipator Researcher and then use her effect to excavate 5, with that effect you want to summon another level 4 rock monster (If you manage to excavate Prank-Kids Rocksies you can also go for The Prank-kids combo in the deck and then continue). Then you want to XYZ summon into your rank 4 Gallant Granite, use it's effect to add a Adamancipator Seeker to hand from deck, you then want to special summon Adamancipator Seeker from your hand and then using its effect to excavate 5 cards special summoning a level 4 rock monster. With the level 4 rock monster and your Adamancipator seeker you want to Synchro summon into Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, you want to excavate 5 cards again, based on what you excavate you can go to the appropriate steps:  Adamancipator Analyzer/ Doki Doki: If you excavate Adamancipator Analyzer or Doki Doki you can special summon 1 of them then either use Doki Doki effect to discard 1 level 4 rock monster so you can special summon Adamancipator Analyzer, or just summon it with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, then you want to excavate 5 cards summoning a level 4 rock type monster. With that you want to then use Adamancipator Researcher and Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, going into Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Then using Adamancipator Analyzer, and your remaining level 4 rock type monster to go into your Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, after that you would activate Adamancipator Signs bringing back either Adamancipator Researcher or Adamancipator Seeker, then linking into Crystron Halqifibrax with Gallant Granite (or Prank-Kids Doodle-doo if you did the Prank-kids combo with Prank-Kids Rocksies) with Crystron Halqifibrax you want to summon your Plaguespreader Zombie from either your hand or deck, after that going into Baroness de Fleur with Adamancipator Dragite and Plaguespreader Zombie. After that using Plaguespreader Zombie effect to revive self.  A level 4 rock type monster: If you excavate a level 4 rock type monster, you want to then Link Summon into Crystron Halqifibrax with that level 4 rock monster and Adamancipator Researcher, with Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie from hand or deck to field, then Synchro summoning into Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite and Plaguespreader Zombie, After that using Plaguespreader effect in your GY to revive itself.  After you use one of those 2 effects you want to then pass your turn. on the start of your opponent's main phase you want to use Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Formula Synchron. The next move your opponent makes you want to use Formula Synchron's effect, using Scarlight Red Dragon Plaguespreader Zombie, and Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  &nbsp;  While this Combo does limit you to only 1 or not even any negates I would say it is okay as with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity you cannot activate effects in the first place. Even though this combo would seem pretty consistent, it is more of a Fun deck because it easily dies to Dark Ruler no More(at the same time almost every deck dies to DRNM). you can get your King Calamity Tributed with either Sphere Mode or Lava Golem but it is a lingering effect therefore your opponent cannot use his/her effects still.  Hope you enjoy the deck!"

I've found that you only need water extenders after your initial normal summon, along with the rank 4 monsters being bonkers better than linking off into a link 4. Because of that, I took out sleepy maiden for more level 4 extenders.  &nbsp;  I'm also not playing Reef...... but I want to. I'm not sure what the best card in the extra is though. Kragen spawn may be a really good card, but idk. It allows me to have more follow up if my board is broken.  &nbsp;  I'm going to experiment with maiden in the future (probably), along with the other new shark card that comes back from the grave. Crystal shark is the perfect discard for the new link 3, so that may go in over a sea nettle, but it also has the potential of bricking a hand if you don't have another level 5 or 4 that can be left over at the end of your combo.  &nbsp;  Lastly, I've placed wave at 1. 3 is too much, but I can't tell if I want to play 2 when it is so easy to search.  &nbsp;  LMK what y'all think of the deck. I'd be happy to have any feedback!"

For the start of the combo, you want to summon 1 level 4 rock monster in your hand, special summon Adamancipator Researcher and then use her effect to excavate 5, with that effect you want to summon another level 4 rock monster (If you manage to excavate Prank-Kids Rocksies you can also go for The Prank-kids combo in the deck and then continue). Then you want to XYZ summon into your rank 4 Gallant Granite, use it's effect to add a Adamancipator Seeker to hand from deck, you then want to special summon Adamancipator Seeker from your hand and then using its effect to excavate 5 cards special summoning a level 4 rock monster. With the level 4 rock monster and your Adamancipator seeker you want to Synchro summon into Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, you want to excavate 5 cards again, based on what you excavate you can go to the appropriate steps:  Adamancipator Analyzer/ Doki Doki: If you excavate Adamancipator Analyzer or Doki Doki you can special summon 1 of them then either use Doki Doki effect to discard 1 level 4 rock monster so you can special summon Adamancipator Analyzer, or just summon it with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, then you want to excavate 5 cards summoning a level 4 rock type monster. With that you want to then use Adamancipator Researcher and Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, going into Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Then using Adamancipator Analyzer, and your remaining level 4 rock type monster to go into your Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, after that you would activate Adamancipator Signs bringing back either Adamancipator Researcher or Adamancipator Seeker, then linking into Crystron Halqifibrax with Gallant Granite (or Prank-Kids Doodle-doo if you did the Prank-kids combo with Prank-Kids Rocksies) with Crystron Halqifibrax you want to summon your Plaguespreader Zombie from either your hand or deck, after that going into Baroness de Fleur with Adamancipator Dragite and Plaguespreader Zombie. After that using Plaguespreader Zombie effect to revive self.  A level 4 rock type monster: If you excavate a level 4 rock type monster, you want to then Link Summon into Crystron Halqifibrax with that level 4 rock monster and Adamancipator Researcher, with Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie from hand or deck to field, then Synchro summoning into Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite and Plaguespreader Zombie, After that using Plaguespreader effect in your GY to revive itself.  After you use one of those 2 effects you want to then pass your turn. on the start of your opponent's main phase you want to use Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Formula Synchron. The next move your opponent makes you want to use Formula Synchron's effect, using Scarlight Red Dragon Plaguespreader Zombie, and Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  &nbsp;  While this Combo does limit you to only 1 or not even any negates I would say it is okay as with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity you cannot activate effects in the first place. Even though this combo would seem pretty consistent, it is more of a Fun deck because it easily dies to Dark Ruler no More(at the same time almost every deck dies to DRNM). you can get your King Calamity Tributed with either Sphere Mode or Lava Golem but it is a lingering effect therefore your opponent cannot use his/her effects still.  Hope you enjoy the deck!"

It’s been 6 months of testing and trying, but in the end what I have is far better than what I started with, and I am truly pleased (and I think you will be too). I bring you the optimal way, in my opinion, to play:</span> <h2><span>Code Talkers </span></h2> <span>Disclaimers: This deck uses (and relies heavily on) certain OCG cards that have not yet come to the TCG. This deck also doesn’t take into consideration price; I was simply attempting to create the best possible deck I could, not one on a budget.</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 1: Why Play Code Talker?</span></h1> <span>Code Talker isn’t really known for being the strongest Cyberse deck out there; that honor is awarded to Salamangreats. Code Talkers are also overshadowed in the TCG (and OCG) by @Ignister, a good archetype in its own right. So why would you play Code Talker over these “better” archetypes? Well, Code Talker is a mix of both Salamangreat </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>@ignister, especially the way that I would tend to play it. Especially with <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>, Code Talker can play a really strong control option with just contemporary hand traps and its omni-negate <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a>. Typically, the ending setup is Heatsoul w/ Conflict or an Xyz with 2 or more hand traps. The best I’ve come across is Heatsoul + Conflict + Xyz + 3 hand traps, meaning a total of 5 possible negates and either an out for your opponent’s monster effects or GY effects. That, and because of the plethora of hand traps and Cyberse swarm power, Code Talker can even OTK effectively by preventing your opponent’s end board and demolishing them with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> + <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a>. The power of this deck compares with many others; I’ve tested it against meta decks (although I don’t know how effective they were piloted or if they simply got a stroke of bad luck, so that isn’t necessarily an irrefutable measure) and I’ve come out on top a lot, so obviously there’s potential here when the OCG cards come out. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>So now that I have convinced you (or at least got you reading this far), how do you play Code Talkers effectively? Well...</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 2: Strategy + Basic Power Cards</span></h1> &nbsp;  <span>Going first, your primary goal is this: <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a> with as many negates/hand traps as possible. Note that there are a variety of ways to do this; in fact, 10 cards in the deck have the capability of netting you a Heatsoul by themselves: <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a>, <a data-name=""Dotscaper"">Dotscaper</a> and <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>. To get <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a> (your go-to omni-negate), you can either dry draw it or use <a data-name=""Micro Coder"">Micro Coder</a>. If you draw into <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, you can get either <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska"">Number 41: Bagooska</a> or <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> for a strong end board. Your goal is to then survive through your opponent’s turn with minimal damage and return strong with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> to wipe the field and/or Heatsoul/<a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> for attack gain. So how do you do all of this?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>For first turn, if you draw into either Lady Debug, Cyberse Gadget, Dotscaper or Cynet Mining, you have a free Heatsoul (second turn all of these can get you a free Accesscode). Here’s how:</span>  <span>Lady Debug: Normal Summon, add <a data-name=""Code Generator"">Code Generator</a>. Debug + Generator (in hand) into <a data-name=""Code Talker"">Code Talker</a>, mill Dotscaper off Generator’s eff, Special Summoning it. Code Talker and Dot into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Cyberse Gadget: Normal Summon. Link into <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a>, summoning Token. Token + Disciple into <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a>. Mage summon Gadget, link into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Dotscaper: Normal Summon. Link into Link Disciple/<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>, summoning Dotscaper from grave by its own eff. Link Disciple/Almiraj + Dot into Splash Mage. Mage summon Dot, link into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Cynet Mining: Search any of the above. Note that if you’re worried about <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, search Lady Debug.</span>  <span>(To get Accesscode, simply link into <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> instead of Heatsoul, summoning a Link from grave and then linking into Accesscode.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you don’t run into any of these, no worries! If you have 2 low-level extenders or a low-level hand trap and an extender, you can still get Heatsoul! Link the extenders into Disciple and the hand traps into Almiraj, and you’re good to go from there.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Third turn (and also going second) doesn’t have a specific combo, it’s just getting as much ATK as you can to finish them off.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Now it’s time to go into why I chose some cards over others:</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 3: Why Do You Have </span><i><span>This </span></i><span>One Instead of </span><i><span>That </span></i><span>One?</span></h1> <span>There were a few things that I switched out and plain deleted over the course of optimizing this deck. One thing that any Code Talker player will say when they see this deck is: why is there no <a data-name=""Cynet Codec"">Cynet Codec</a>? And my response is: Codec is strong, sure, but there’s nothing that it can do to make the deck more effective. This deck can already get an Accesscode off of 1 card in hand; not to mention there’s plenty of extenders in this deck. Therefore, the extra power provided by Codec isn’t necessary. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Another thing people may notice: why do I have <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>? Two reasons: Nibiru token and Gadget token. If you need more of an explanation, you haven’t played Yu-Gi-Oh! long enough.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Something else: why do I have 3 of <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>? Because I really want to see it, and it will never be a brick because of how much you Link Summon. There’s really no reason not to.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is in there because not only is it a good hand trap, but it also can negate <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, which can absolutely destroy this deck if you only have Debug (which is uncommon but can happen). You can definitely replace this with another hand trap or with <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>All hand traps can be replaced in the main with others depending on the meta, with two exceptions: Ash Blossom and <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>. Ash for obvious reasons, Phantazmay because that hand fix ability and the protection can absolutely save this deck. I also wouldn’t get rid of Effect Veiler personally, but that’s simply my personal opinion.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> is there instead of <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> because when you have OTK potential, it’s stupid to throw it out the window by having your opponent take 0 damage.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you have any questions for why any of the cards are what they are, just comment on this and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 4: General Comments</span></h1> <span>If you have <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a> set, make sure not to activate <a data-name=""Lancea"">Lancea</a> until you’ve used it, because Lancea interferes with the second part of it. I believe that you can still negate with Conflict, but it just won’t banish and lock your opponent from using another card of the same name, but I’m not certain.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Proxy Horse"">Proxy Horse</a> and <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> are useful when you have multiple starters in hand. Horse is also the alternative grave send off of Generator. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>There are 12 starters (3 <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Dotscaper"">Dotscaper</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Proxy Horse"">Proxy Horse</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>), 16 hand traps (3 Ash, 3 Veiler, 3 Phantazmay, 2 Lancea, 2 <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a>, 1 Nibiru, 1 Imperm, 1 Reboot), 11 extenders (3 <a data-name=""Micro Coder"">Micro Coder</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Code Generator"">Code Generator</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Code Exporter"">Code Exporter</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Code Radiator"">Code Radiator</a>) and 3 negates (3 <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a>). That’s 42 cards with no draw cards, so you may think that this deck wouldn’t be the best. But it’s still very consistant, with about an 80% chance of seeing a starter, and a higher chance if you include workable hands with 2 extenders or a summonable hand trap and an extender. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>You can probably main 3 <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, since your only monster on the field usually is Heatsoul going first. I don’t like that option, as it messes with your turn 3 strat, but it’ll work and may be more effective in the long run.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is hit hardest by <a data-name=""Psy-framegear Gamma"">Psy-framegear Gamma</a> (on Debug or Splash), <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> (although it can possibly work through it with enough extenders) and any negates with a destruction/banish clause. Cannot play through <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>, <a data-name=""There Can Only Be One"">There Can Only Be One</a> or <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> unless you draw a whole ton of Code extenders. Anything that negates on-field effects and/or graveyard effects destroys any potential for getting a win without spell/trap removal. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Kaijus and other side-deck monsters such as <a data-name=""Prankratops"">Prankratops</a> and <a data-name=""Alpha, King of Beasts"">Alpha, King of Beasts</a> don’t really work with this deck as they mess with Transcode’s requirement. Feel free to try it, but I can say that it probably won’t work.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>As always, feel free to do what you like with it. Any questions can go in the comments, as well as any suggestions for making it better. Thanks!</span>  &nbsp;"
