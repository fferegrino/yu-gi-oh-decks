Phantom Knights, Adventurer, DPE, Scythe, and Eldlich rolled into one package. Extensive deck guide included.","<h2>Backstory:</h2>
On paper, this deck should not work. Well, the PK/Adventure/DPE part of the deck would obviously work, but why am I playing an Eldlich engine and a 60-card deck?

The answer: <em>I am insane.</em>

I also really enjoy confusing my opponents. Now I am a firm believer in the 40-card deck. It's mathematically sound, extremely consistent, and promotes good deckbuilding. However, I truly believe that the Phantom Knights, thanks to the addition of Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Artifact Dagda, and the Adventurer cards into Master Duel, have such absurd degrees of consistency that you can get away with running this deck at 60 cards. This deck just somehow <em>doesn't brick</em>. Every hand is playable, and going first or second, the deck is capable of playing through an incredible amount of disruption. Due to this incredible consistency, you are able to add 3 Crossout Designators and as many targets for it as you desire to a standard PK deck. When you're done with that, you're left with just the perfect amount of cards to splash in an Eldlich engine. Though it may just be my sweet spot for the Eldlich cards, I actually do believe it has incredible synergy with both the PK and Adventurer engines. Due to the major cost of cards in both engines being to discard a card from your hand, this 'cost' is quickly turned into another power boost for the deck, as your Eldlich cards are free targets for this cost. The Eldlich cards are also extremely good at covering for the weaknesses of the remainder of the deck. It is really easy to power through your resources with Phantom Knights, only to have your entire board broken and wiped by a deck designed specifically to do those things; this is where Eldlich steps in. His incredible recyclability and generally sticky nature allows you to power through the game even after most of your powerful cards have been extended. He is also the best way this deck can deal with powerful field negates, as Eldlich's GY effect is a floating effect, allowing Eldlich to be immune to targeted field negation. Overall, I think Eldlich was a good choice for rounding out the basic concept of a 60-card Phantom Knights deck.

&lt;!--more View Decklist--&gt;
<h2>The Decklist, Explained:</h2>
<h3>Main Deck:</h3>
<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Effect Veiler&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Effect Veiler</strong></a> - This card was put in as a target for Crossout Designator, but in niche situations can be made into Predaplant Verte Anaconda or Artifact Dagda. In hyper-specific scenarios, it can also be used to make Crystron Halqifibrax to facilitate a link climb into Knightmare Unicorn for those particularly hard-to-out cards.

<strong><a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a></strong> - This card is easily the most powerful handtrap ever printed and if its effect resolves, will single-handedly win you the game, as it will either floodgate your opponent out of summoning, allowing you to easily gain an advantageous board position, or fill your hand with half the cards in your deck, allowing you to combo out of or break any board you may face. It's also a target for Crossout Designator, as you will likewise automatically lose if this card is resolved against you.

<strong><a data-name=""Junk Forward"">Junk Forward</a></strong> - Junk Forward is your basic combo starter; with this card plus any other level 3 monster in the deck, including itself (of which there are 22), you are capable of making Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. If you open Junk Forward and Water Enchantress of the Temple or Rite of Aramesir, you can just use him to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda or Artifact Dagda as you see fit.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a></strong> - This card is a basic Phantom Knights engine piece, when it's in the GY, you are capable of searching ANY Phantom Knights card from your deck. Typically, you will do this to search The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots, which is PK's basic combo extender.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a></strong> - This card is Phantom Knights' basic combo extender. When you have any other PK monster on the field, you can summon this card from your hand. If you open Silent Boots and any other PK, you can normal summon the other PK to special Silent Boots and make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. Silent Boots also has the neat GY effect of searching the powerful PK traps.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a></strong> - Ideally, you want to get Ragged Gloves in the GY as fast as possible, as he allows you to swap him out for any other PK monster in your GY, and there are many, many good targets for this.

<strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></strong> - This card is incredible for three different reasons. One, it's an incredible hand-trap that if played wisely enough can effectively end your opponent's turn prematurely. Two, it's a level 3, meaning you can use it to make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. Three, it's a tuner, which means it can be used to make Crystron Halqifibrax in a crunch to link climb into Knightmare Unicorn for those hard-to-out cards.

<strong><a data-name=""Danger?! Tsuchinoko?"">Danger?! Tsuchinoko?</a></strong> - This card fits this deck perfectly for countless reasons. It's a level 3, so it's capable of making Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. It's a free special summon regardless of it gets hit by its own effect or not, but if it doesn't get hit by your effect, it's also a free card draw. It can also be discarded for the cost of The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche or Fateful Adventure to summon it for free. You can also summon multiple Tsuchinokos per turn with this effect, meaning opening multiple in your hand isn't even a downside. Having this card in your hand ever is just a straight-up advantage for you in literally any scenario.

<strong><a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a></strong> - This card is a free special summon with any other level 3 on the board, meaning it's capable of making Cherubini Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. It's also a target for Emergency Teleport.

<strong><a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a></strong> - This card serves the same exact purpose as Wheeleder, but has a different name allowing you to use both Wheeleder and Tracker in the same turn.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan</strong></a> - Nyannyan is in the deck specifically as a target for Emergency Teleport. When any level 3 (there are 22 in the deck) is summoned to the field, she can be revived from the GY for free to make either The Phantom Knights of Break Sword or Leviair the Sea Dragon and by extension, Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder in niche situations. Just be careful when you use her GY effect, as you will be locked into only the deck's Xyz monsters (a hard-drawn Fusion Destiny for Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer is allowed, too) for the turn.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a></strong> - Torn Scales is easily the strongest Main Deck monster for PK, as he has an on-field and in GY effect to gain advantage. His field effect allows you to discard a card and send any PK to the GY, which are both beneficial things for the deck. His GY effect allows you to summon him after banishing any other PK card from your GY, making him your best monster to chain into more Link monsters. Be careful with his field effect, however, as activating its effect after Normal Summoning him locks you out of the Adventure cards.

<strong><a data-name=""Water Enchantress of the Temple"">Water Enchantress of the Temple</a></strong> - This card being at 2 in Master Duel means nothing to this deck thanks to Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss. If you don't hard draw her, you can just send her to the GY by his effect and gain access to every card in the Adventurer engine.

<strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a></strong> - Celestial is one of your targets for Fusion Destiny to make DPE, chosen due to its GY effect to Pot of Greed (draw 2 cards) if your hand is empty.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Artifact Scythe&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Artifact Scythe</strong></a> - An obscenely powerful card you only have to play one of thanks to the absurdly accessible Artifact Dagda, requiring only 2 monsters with different names as its materials. Destroying this card during your opponent's turn allows you to lock them out of their Extra Deck, winning you the game instantly (when going first) against most decks.

<strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - Dasher is one of your targets for Fusion Destiny to make DPE, chosen due to its GY effect to Special Summon a monster you draw.

<strong><a data-name=""Wandering Gryphon Rider"">Wandering Gryphon Rider</a></strong> - A free, recursively searchable negate with the added bonus if it being really hard-to-out due to its effect to send itself back into the deck after negating an effect. This is typically your target from Fateful Adventure.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Eldlich the Golden Lord&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Eldlich the Golden Lord</strong></a> - Eldlich is an obscenely powerful monster on his own, and is capable of fitting into many, many places. Has a powerful hand effect and a powerful GY effect and is the deck's best answer to field Monster negates. He is also extremely recyclable and decently hard to out.

<strong><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong> - Though primarily a target for Crossout Designator, as Nibiru happens to be a great weakness for this deck, if you somehow draw it going second it will single-handedly win you the game against a lot of decks.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Foolish Burial&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Foolish Burial</strong></a> - An extremely diverse card with an endless amount of applications for this deck. Good targets include: Water Enchantress of the Temple (for access to the entire Adventure engine), The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (for a free PK search), The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales (for a free summon), and Eldlich the Golden Lord (for a powerful and hard-to-out boss monster).

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement of the Army&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong></a> - Another extremely diverse card with an endless amount of applications for this deck. Good targets include: Junk Forward (for a free summon), The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (for a GY search), The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots (for a free summon), and The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales (for a +3 in card advantage if all of his effects are used properly).

<strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong> - Target for Verte to make DPE. If hard-drawn, makes your life easier, just make sure it's the last thing you play on your turn, as it will lock you out of summoning in this deck.

<strong><a data-name=""Rite of Aramesir"">Rite of Aramesir</a></strong> - One of the most heinous one-card combos ever put in the game; this card allows you to have the entire Adventurer engine at your disposal. It's searchable by Water Enchantress of the Temple (who is, by extension, searchable by Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss), and when played, summons a Token and allows you to activate Fateful Adventure. You can then activate Fateful Adventure to add Wandering Gryphon Rider, Special Summon Wandering Gryphon Rider to get Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon for free and equip it to the Token. At the end of this card's combo, you have a once-per-turn negate and bounce to hand. This deck also makes it incredibly easy to gain access to all of these cards.

<strong><a data-name=""Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon"">Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon</a></strong> - You typically don't want to hard-draw this card, and thanks to the deck being 60 cards, it's incredibly rare you will. When equipped to a Token, allows you to bounce 1 card to your opponent's hand per turn. Also, has a revival effect on send to GY.

<strong><a data-name=""Fateful Adventure"">Fateful Adventure</a></strong> - Card can be activated by Rite of Aramesir. Another card you don't typically want to hard-draw, but it's not even that bad of a situation if you do. It allows you to search any Adventure monster, which you will typically use to grab Wandering Gryphon Rider. This card will also give your Token Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon when you summon.

<strong><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></strong> - This card is a great combo starter, allowing you to summon any level 3 or lower Psychic from your deck. You will typically want to target Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan with this effect, as it can be recycled into a Rank 3 Xyz monster later on in your turn.

<strong><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - This card is a powerful answer to handtraps and also a fantastic counter to decks which need their GYs to play the game. It also is a fantastic target for Crossout Designator, as your deck would really enjoy access to its GY.

<strong><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a></strong> - This card is obscenely powerful in Master Duel, due to many staples and hand-traps being relatively copy-pasted from deck to deck. This card allows you to negate any card in the game so long as you have it in your deck. Due to this, this deck runs many 1-ofs of problematic cards which may stop you in your tracks.

<strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong> - This card is really good for breaking boards, and it has the incredibly nice added bonus to load your GY with monsters from your hand or field, which, in this deck, is a fantastic thing.

<strong><a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a></strong> - This card is a good way to provide protection to monsters that typically do not have protections, and in your GY, allows you to summon a PK monster for free.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a></strong> - This card is a free summon if you don't have any cards in your GY, at the cost of being a level 4. It's searchable by Silent Boots' GY effect, making it particularly useful for making Artifact Dagda and Predaplant Verte Anaconda (though it will have to become Link Spider first).

<strong><a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine</a></strong> - This card allows you to Special Summon Eldlich from your deck and can be set by the GY effects of Huaquero and Conquistador.

<strong><a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a></strong> - This is PK's scariest trap card, allowing you to the negate the effects of a face-up monster on the field, which can severely hinder your opponent's gameplan.  It has a nice GY effect of allowing you to summon any PK from your GY for free.

<strong><a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a></strong> - Eldlich support card that essentially acts as an extra Called by the Grave if you have an Eldlich. Can also be discarded by any discard effect to get an Eldlich during your opponent's turn.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Conquistador of the Golden Land&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Conquistador of the Golden Land</strong></a> - Eldlich support card that allows you to destroy any face-up card if you have an Eldlich. Can also be discarded by any discard effect to get an Eldlich during your opponent's turn.
<h3>Extra Deck:</h3>
<strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> - One of the most powerful boss monsters in YGO history. Can be easily made by practically any deck with any two Effect Monsters linked into Predaplant Verte Anaconda, which this deck is more than capable of doing. It destroys one card on your side of the field to destroy any other card as a Quick Effect, and can revive itself each Standby Phase after its destruction. It has the added bonus of being able to destroy a Set Artifact Scythe on your opponent's turn to lock them out of the Extra Deck, automatically winning you the game against most decks when going first.

<strong><a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a></strong> - One of the deck's two Rank 3 Xyz Monsters. They are incredibly easy to make in this deck, though Leviair is intended for games that have drawn out a bit long, allowing you to re-summon a monster that was previously banished, either to revive your Eldliches or recycle your PKs who have already used their GY effects.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a></strong> - One of the deck's two Rank 3 Xyz Monsters. They are incredibly easy to make in this deck. Break Sword is essentially a diet DPE, allowing you to detach a material to destroy one card on your side of the field and one card on your opponent's field. It's a very efficient way to get out Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder, as it has an okay body and a way to free up a way for it to attack directly. If this monster attacks at all, you can make Zeus for free in Main Phase 2 to board wipe the opponent without triggering destruction effects or immunities.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong></a> - If you manage to attack with either of the deck's two other Xyz monsters, you can make Zeus in the Main Phase 2 for a Quick Effect board clear that doesn't trigger destruction effects or immunities.

<strong><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a></strong> - Link Spider allows you to turn any of the Trap Normal Monsters (i.e., The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine, Huaquero of the Golden Land, and Conquistador of the Golden Land) into an Effect Monster in order to use them as materials for Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Accesscode Talker, or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.

<strong><a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a></strong> - The easiest monster for this deck to make, as well as the most important. If you have any two level 3s on the field, you can make Cherubini. His effect allows you to send any level 3 monster from your deck to the GY <em>as a cost</em>, allowing you to do it <em>even when Cherubini is negated</em>. You will typically use this effect to send Water Enchantress of the Temple to the GY, which will gain you access to any card in the entire Adventurer engine with its combo. If you hard-drew Water Enchantress of the Temple or Rite of Aramesir in your starting hand, you can instead use this card as a Foolish Burial. He can also be used later on to make The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche.

<strong><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> - Crystron Halqifibrax was primarily added to the deck to help make Knightmare Unicorn a bit easier to access, as this deck can sometimes only afford to Link away two of its monsters, as many of the other ones you'd rather stick around. With any monster and a tuner, you can make Crystron and then make Unicorn.

<strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a></strong> - With its extremely generic materials, Phoenix is an easy and great way to remove frightening backrow from your opponent.

<strong><a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></strong> - This card allows you to Set Artifact Scythe directly from your deck, allowing you to lock your opponent out of their Extra Deck extremely easily with DPE.

<strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> - This card is so incredibly powerful in practically any deck in the game, as it allows them to access powerful Extra Deck monsters that the deck should probably not have access to. It was even recently banned in the TCG due to its power. Luckily, it's still legal in Master Duel and can be abused extremely easily in this deck. Use its effect to make DPE, then pop your Artifact Scythe in their Draw/Standby Phase to make your opponent cry.

<strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> - This deck relies heavily on destruction effects, so monsters immune to destruction pose a serious threat to this deck, making Knightmare Unicorn a necessary addition to this deck's toolkit. It can get rid of those monsters without actually destroying them, saving you a lot of headache.

<strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a></strong> - This card makes an incredible amount of tempo for you in PK decks, allowing you to send any PK from the deck to the GY <em>and</em> giving you a free PK Trap. It can be made with Cherubini plus any DARK Monster after you use Cherubini's effect.

<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong></a> - As it is not very rare that you will end up having boards of 4, 5, and sometimes even 6 monsters by turns 2, 3, and 4, Apollousa is a no-brainer in the deck, as it allows you to negate many effects from your opponent's monsters on a non-once-per-turn effect.

<strong><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></strong> - Accesscode is your deck's easiest way to close out games. Any time your opponent has taken any amount of damage, they are in serious threat of you being able to kill them due to this card. This card will gain 1000 ATK times the Link rating of a Link monster used for its creation, which in this deck can possibly be as high as a 5000 ATK gain. On top of this powerful stat boost, his effects cannot be responded to by opponents. He also gets the ridiculously strong non-once-per-turn effect to destroy enemy cards at the cost of banishing a Link monster from your field or GY, which you will gather an obscene amount as this deck plays 11 of them.

<strong><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a></strong> - Underworld Goddess is another way to get rid of problematic boss monsters that your opponent has, bypassing nearly every protection in the game, as it is using your opponent's monster as a material. When on the field, it also grants you some pretty powerful effects. When the card is summoned, it negates all of your opponent's face-up monsters until they die, and it can once-per-turn prevent your opponent from summoning from the GY, which something a lot of decks do nowadays."

If you expect a lot of Tearalaments and like playing control, this could be a good deck.","Altergeists can facilitate Necrovalley, and Necrovalley seems really good vs Sprights, but more importantly, could be gg vs Tearalaments. This is a version of Geist built to facilitate Necrovalley.

So, 0 Hand traps outside of Imperm. Imperm + Faker is brutal, but otherwise our plan is to set backrow. 3 Faker, the best Geist, 3 Meluseek, good removal and it searches Faker, 3 Mario, you need names and it is technically a sort of starter, 1 Pooquery, card is fine, being able to pop off for a bit is nice, 1 Konq, 2 Silq. These are the standard numbers, nothing flashy here.

I wanted to run Necrovalley, and I wanted is badly enough to run Terraforming and Metaverse. Metaverse is weaker here than in most Geist decks, because Necrovalley shuts down Haufiness BS and makes Orange Herald into mill 5 less terrifying, but Metaverse triggers Multifaker, so it makes the cut. The only other spell I wanted to run was 3 Pot of Extravagence. Free draw 2 in the deck, and the deck needs the card advantage in 2022.

2 Protocol with 1 Manifestation and 3 Spoofing are pretty standard numbers. Manifestation is turned off by Necrovalley, but you still want to have it in the deck even though you can play through Valley fine. You still want access to those lines when Necrovalley isn't on the board, and it is a fine bluff when it is. Imperm and the Solemns are pretty standard. It seems like Compulse is pretty good right now for monster removal. and Dinomiscus is copium for Mystic Mine.

3 Secret Village are here for games 2 and 3, when the backrow sweepers will all be coming in. The only exception is Vs Tear, where Necrovalley is completely worth it. The Mix of D. Barrior and D.D.G. gives us turn skippers to fit in instead of spot removal. Artifact Sanctum + Scythe is a second turn skipper alternative.

For Backrow I need Harpie's because of Mine, but Red Reboot and Evenly are too appealing next to Multifaker to pass up."

Usual Process:
<ol>
 	<li>You'll almost always want to start out with Force Strix. Make it with Mimicry if you can so you can use its graveyard effect when detached.</li>
 	<li>Get two more level fours on the field. I usually accomplish this with Singing and Raider's Wing if I have one of the two in hand (Stained Greaves can also be used if you start with it and search Raider's Wing).</li>
 	<li>Link into Wise Strix and activate its effect to summon from your deck. Get Mimicry if you haven't used it yet, otherwise it doesn't matter.</li>
 	<li>Summon Raider's Knight. Use its effect to go into Stranger. Search Skip Force with Wise Strix.</li>
 	<li>Use Skip Force to summon Arsenal Falcon. If you're going second it may be worth it to go into battle phase and use your 2-3 attacks with Arsenal. Otherwise use it to summon Strangle from your deck. You can then use Strangle's effect to be able to summon another Rank 4.</li>
 	<li>After using Arsenal's effect you can use it to link into Bardiche. Its graveyard effect will allow Ultimate Falcon to be summoned.</li>
 	<li>Using Bardiche's effect to send Silent Boots to the graveyard will let you search 2 spell/trap cards. What you want depends on what Rank 4 you summoned.
<ol>
 	<li>For Force Strix you'll want Fog Blade or Phantom Knight's Claw along with Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic. Rank Up into Revolution Falcon-Air Raid for a monster destruction and to activate Bardiche's card destruction effect.</li>
 	<li>For Steelswarm Roach you'll want 2 Fog Blades or a Fog Blade and Phantom Knight's Claw.</li>
 	<li>For Abyss Dweller you'll want 2 Fog Blades.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Things to Keep in Mind:
<ol>
 	<li>Strangle Lanius's self-summon locks you into Dark monsters, stopping the summon of Abyss Dweller.</li>
 	<li>Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic locks you into XYZ, stopping the summon of Wise Strix and Bardiche.</li>
 	<li>Some good searches with Mimicry or Force Strix:
<ol>
 	<li>Singing Lanius. Can be special summoned with an XYZ monster on the field.</li>
 	<li>Strangle Lanius. Can be special summoned with a dark monster on the field.</li>
 	<li>Raider's Wing. Can be special summoned by removing an overlay unit from a dark monster, and also allows Stained Greaves to be summoned from your hand.</li>
 	<li>Mimicry can search Phantom Knight's claw. This is a spare negate if you already have full combo.</li>
 	<li>Mimicry can search Pain Lanius. If you're opening with Tribute Lanius you would only have to 400 damage in order to summon it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Arc Rebellion can be summoned by Raider's Knight or by Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic. This monster can very easily hit for game if you're going second.</li>
 	<li>Stranger Falcon, Revolution Falcon-Air Raid, and Arsenal Falcon all have floating effects.</li>
 	<li>Fog Blade can bring back Bardiche or another Phantom Knight with their Graveyard effect.</li>
 	<li>Skip Force can use its graveyard effect to bring back Ultimate Falcon or another Raidraptor XYZ from the grave.</li>
 	<li>Steelswarm Roach's effect only applies to summons that don't start a chain, making it mainly only useful against Synchro or Tribute decks. You may want to replace it with another Raidraptor XYZ or another Rank 4 such as Time Thief Redoer. Satellite Falcon is decent choice as it can clear your opponent's backrow and its quick effect essentially lets you reduce a monster's attack to zero.</li>
</ol>
This is the main deck that I play in Master Duel and it's fairly consistent and makes a pretty resilient end board. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Let me know if you have any suggestions for improving it!"

Here is where I have landed.

For interruptions out whole game is about Maxx ""C"". With Adventurers and early Baronnes, I felt pretty insulated from most other hand traps, and with the deck's extreme power level I feel pretty confident in my ability to win when Maxx ""C"" doesn't resolve. As a result I'm on 2 Maxx ""C"" for Crossout (and its own power) and 3 Ash, both Called By, and 3 Crossout, taking advantage of the card being unlimited in Master Duel.

Adventurer package is pretty standard, but this deck is unusual in using Gryphon Rider as material more often than as a negate. We're also on 4 of the 7s for the Tenyis, with the Rose Dragon package, another thing unlimited in Master Duel that is limited in another format. After that the deck is basically just combo pieces, any Halq or Galaxy Tomahawk is probably game if it doesn't get interrupted, so most 2 summons will just immediately take over the game."

<strong><em>HOW THIS COMBO WORKS.</em></strong>

summon The Agent of Creation - Venus, use it's effect to summon 3 mystical shineballs from your deck or hand, link summon into union carrier, use union carrier's effect to equip from your hand or deck Eva on mystical shineball or Venus, then link summon Ptotector of The Agents- Moon, use both Moon's effect to send Majesty Hyperion to the graveyard AND Eva's effect to banish 2 fairy light monsters from your graveyard in order to add to your hand The Agent of Life- Neptune and D.D. Sprite, then banish Union carrier in order to special summon D.D. Spite and use Neptune's  effect to send it to the graveyard in order to special summon Venus from your graveyard, then banish Neptune in order to special summon Majesty Hyperion, use Neptune's effect to add The Sanctuary in The Sky to your hand, activate The Sanctuary in The Sky, and then link summon Celestial knightlord Parshath by using Moon and Venus treating Moon as 2 link materials, use Parshath's effect to add Arcana force The World to your hand by discarding one card from your hand,then activate Light Barrier if you have it on your hand, then link summon using D.D. Sprite and Majesty Hyperion into kryston halqifibrax, use both parshath's effect to summon the world by banishing a  fairy monster from your graveyard that is lower level than The World's level AND kryston's effect to special summon jet synchron, use The World's effect applying light barrier to chose Heads effect or if you dont have light barrier flip a coin, if its Heads end your turn, use The World's effect to skip your opponent's next turn by sending kryston and jet synchron to the graveyard and moning the turn right back at you, since this turn after your opponent's turn got skipped was the the 2nd turn and now is the 3rd turn and not the 1st you can perform battle phase this turn, use parshath's effect to add The Agent of Mystery- Earth to your hand and summon it, then banish venus from your graveyard or moon to special summon Majesty Hyperion, perform the battle phase and attack with all your monsters and that's it you won the duel, however if the effect of the world is tails, synchro summon using jet synchron and kryston into mecha phantom beast auradon, special summon 3 tokens use its effect to summon best o-lion by using parshath and auroradon, synchro summon Hyper Librarian to the extra monster zone, use o-lion's effect to special summon a token, special summon jet synchron by discarding one card, and synchro summon into cupid pitch, increase cupid's level to 5, then synchro summon borreload savage dragon and equip parshath from your graveyard and use cupid's effect to add creation resonator to your hand, special summon creation resonator and synchro summon using the world and resonator to Psychic End Punisher, or synchro summon using the world and o-lion to barrone de fleur to the extra monster zone and then use jet synchro's effect to special summon it, cupid pitch and synchro summon boreload savage dragon then add nemeses corridor to your hand, special summon nemeses and then special summon thunder dragon colosus.

<strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong>

if you don't have Venus in your hand, you can still normal summon Earth to add Venus to your hand then use Neptune's effect to summon Venus.

another one would be to summon Diviner of The Herald, send trias hierarchia to the graveyard, tribute the herald to special summon trias, use diviner of the herald's effect to synchro summon Masterflare Hyperion, send venus to the graveyard using Masterflare's effect, and proceed with the combo.

<em><strong>OTHER COMBOS</strong></em>

normal summon Earth, add to your hand Neptune, link summon into salamangreat almiraj, use Neptune's effect to special summon Earth, then link summon cryston halqifibrax and proceed with the combo

if you didn't go first you can still summon archlord krystia if you think or know your opponent might special summon a powerful monster

you can still use venus to make a board with borreload savage dragon, archlord krystia, baronne de fleur and thunder dragon colossus in 1 turn"

This is generally done through the use of interactive spells and traps that complicate the opponent's ability to enact their game plan efficiently and counter their attempts to solidify a board presence, followed by a Chaos Sorcerer/BLS-fueled Return from the Different Dimension that will ideally see your foe's LP drop to 0 when all is said and done.

I've only recently returned to YGO/GOAT Format, so the sideboard is currently serving merely as a pool of cards for consideration for the Chaos Return strategy. This will continue to evolve and eventually take shape into a serviceable sideboard to combat dominant decks and archetypes (at the time of writing this in July 2022) such as Panda Burn, Chaos Turbo, Warrior variants, and Control variants."

This version is actually pretty brutal, it has the same ceiling as the previous version, but more power when going second. The goal of the deck is to put up negations and then swing for game all at once. It's named after the 3 support spells that will ""full combo"" - Therions DISCOliseum, Cyber Emergency, and Magical Meltdown. The idea is to put up Mechabas and Regulus, and fuel them by using the recursive power of Herz, but Chimeratech plays really round the strategy out going second.

Into the card by card.

5 Therions cards, 3 Regulus, 2 Disco. You always want to see this card, but you never want to see 2 copies, so we run exactly 5. The goal is to equip this with Herz and use the Herz to fuel Mechabas. We're also maxed out on Aleisters. Oddly enough, with The Light we can make Mechabas without this card, and there are okay plays that don't see an Aleister, but Aleister is our main starter and a key combo piece. Terraforming also the 6th copy of Disco in addition to being the 7th Aleister. 2 Invocation to go with the package, partially to bait the Ash, but the card is also fine to see with Cyber Dragon cards. We're on 3 Power Bond. This is an OTK enabler that also makes really big Mechabas while setting up the GY, and you want to see this card more than Invocation whether going first or second. For Cyber Dragons it is 3 Herz, 2 Cyber Dragon, and 3 Emergency. Your goal is to use Herz as fusion material, search a Cyber Dragon, maybe even use it to break boards, equip Herz to Regulus, recycle Herz, and maybe pitch it again to Mechaba, or just use it to fuel 1 Mechaba ad infinitum. We're also on 2 of The Light: Hex Sealed Fusion. This card is bonkers with Super Poly, but it is mostly just here to enable Mechabas when we don't see Aleister (it's also a Cyber Dragon monster for the purposes of Chimeratech Rampage Dragon, and a backup Polymerization sometimes.) After that, I wanted Board Breakers and Cosmic Cyclone. We're on the Ultimate Slayer package with the 1 Evil Twins as a brick in the main. Going first, negate negate negate. Going second, clean up and sweep."

Well then, do I have a deck for YOU!","<p>Tenyi Swordsoul has been wrecking the ranked ladder for about 2 months now and is clearly Tier one. It is consistent, powerful, great going first AND second, and to top it off, the art is amazing. But, Swordsoul doesn't only help the Tenyi monsters make a Non-effect monster and win, they also help every other deck that uses the Wyrm typing. One such deck is Yang Zing, but more specifically,&nbsp; <a data-name=""Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing"">Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</a>, and&nbsp; <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing</a> (AKA Ding Dong). Ding Dong on its own is amazing for more reasons, but they both search <a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a>, an Omni-Negate that Shuffles into the Deck and procks the Floating effects of the Yang Zing (which notoriously <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/If..._You_Can_VS_When..._You_Can"" rel=""nofollow"">miss timing</a>). On top of this, Zefraniu searches <a data-name=""Zefra War"">Zefra War</a>, a quick effect pop on the opponent's turn, and Ding Dong can Foolish any Wyrm (Like the Tenyis), is a tuner and can be made off of Adhara + any 4. to facilitate this play, we are playing a Zefra package to help use this and go second. Below is an explanation of each card used in the list and the ratios chosen</p><hr />&lt;!--more--&gt;<p>The Zefra package includes 3 <a data-name=""Zefra Providence"">Zefra Providence</a>, which is a Search Spell that searches a Search Spell and can protect your Pendulum Scales.&nbsp; <a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra"">Oracle of Zefra</a><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra""> is the second Search Spell and can theoretically stack your deck after Synchro with your Zefra, but that effect never matters and you always pop the card with war. For Zefra Monsters other than Zefraniu, we are playing </a><a data-name=""Zefraxi, Treasure of the &lt;a data-name="">Zefraxi, Treasure of the </a><a data-name=""Yang Zing for a Low Scale"">Yang Zing for</a><a data-name=""Yang Zing for a Low Scale"">&nbsp;a Low Scale</a><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra""> searchable off of Emergence, otherwise is the worst card in the Deck. We are also playing 1 </a><a data-name=""Satellarknight Zefrathuban"">Satellarknight Zefrathuban</a><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra""> and </a><a data-name=""Satellarknight Zefraxcition"">Stellarknight Zefraxciton as </a><a data-name=""Oracle of Zefra"">extra scales that also help us go second. And finally, 2 </a><a data-name=""Zefraath"">Zefraath</a><a data-name=""Zefraath"">, the glue that holds the Zefra package together. It allows you to basically foolish your Zefraniu for summoning and can complete your scales extremely easily. the one bad part about the card is that it is horrid in multiples, so we are only playing two. </a>With the Tenyis, I opted to use less, due to the size of the deck becoming just too big. As for the ratios, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Ashuna represents any other of your Tenyi monsters, so we play three. </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Adhara</a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna""> and </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Vishuda are both at two just for space, but they are always available to you, so it isn't that big of a deal.&nbsp; </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana""> is at one, is amazing, and should be standard in every build. There have been many games that I have won because of the control game that this card, </a><a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">, and </a><a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi allow. It truly is amazing. Notably, I am not playing&nbsp; </a><a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a><a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">. In all honesty, I think that Vessel is superfluous for the deck, due to Ding Dong and Taia being better Foolishes for the deck, and you do not generally need the Tenyi search.</a> The Swordsoul engine in this deck is standard so this part isn't as in-depth. The only interesting this here is the 1 Taia, instead of the standard two. This is due to the number of Pendulum monsters in the deck (Reminder that Pendulum monsters <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pendulum_Monster#Sent_face-up_to_the_Extra_Deck"" rel=""nofollow"">only go to the grave if discarded or detached via Xyz Material</a>) conflicting with its effect. The non-archetype cards in this are quite standard. Ash, Maxx ""C"", and Called By is just the Master Duel tax. Halq is just in there because I already had him, but you can easily cut him. The rest of this will be a quick overview of the interactions and things to know in the deck to play optimally.</p><ol><li>If the chain that Nine Pillars is activated, Destroying Zefraniu, has more activations of cards earlier in the chain, even if they are negated, Zefraniu will miss the timing, not searching War. Don't you just LOVE timing rules :)</li><li>Using the Zefra Yang Zing monsters as a Mo Ye reveal is extremely crucial for some plays, and if you need to search for one, ALWAYS search for Zefraxil. This is due to Zefraniu being almost useless in the hand, unless for a Pendulum Summon (You do need to play 2 just in case you lose access), and Zefraxi being the opposite scale.</li><li>You will most likely not end on an 8 Synchro AND a 10 Synchro, but you will most likely end on one OR the other + Nine Pillars + Monk.

This is a mixed Cyber Dragon list, designed to be capable of breaking boards and OTKing but also very capable of setting up a negate or two, setting backrow, and passing. The idea is you don't know whether you're going first or second game 1, so you tune between games (when you have a guess) and the maindeck tries to balance both.

Into the card by card.

3 Core. Normal Core, add Overflow is a line I actually like in Cyber Dragons. It can also search Cyberdark Realm to open up OTK lines, or summon another 5 to make Infinity. This is just your main starter, and you want to run 3. 3 Emergency, Rota for the deck. Core searches this, this searches Core, pretty basic stuff. The second effect doesn't come up, but mostly because people usually play around it, (and because Ass Blossom works fine) so you're winning on that one anyways. 1 Repair Plant. We're running 1 Kaiju in our boardbreaking suite, but mostly this is just an easy back-up Rota, and it'll allow you to string Rotas. 3 Overflow, best card in the deck. It's an amazing Trap card on its own merits, but it is also insane bait, and I always want to play 3 of this card. 3 Cyber Dragon and 1 Toon. Part of the reason I think this deck is good is that breaking an Elf in the EMZ is easy when you see any Cyber Dragon. These cards are also insane against Machines thanks to Fortress, which isn't huge in the meta, but comes up. 3 Herz. Herz is great to equip to a Regulus, and important to send off of Rampage, and is also just another good Cyber Dragon. Picking itself back up is usually my preferred play to searching Cyber Dragon, but the fact that it recovers itself, or a Core in the GY, or searches Cyber Dragon makes it a great toolbox card. For Cyberdarks I'm on 1 Realm, 1 Chimera, and 1 Power Bond. Power Bond is great to see in this deck, especially going second, and I love the utility of Core + any Spell/Trap equaling popping 2 backrow, picking back up a core, and then OTKing on an empty board. Chimera is weirdly useful on it's own as well, so really you have 3 good cards to add a good engine to Core. I like that. I'm running 1 searchable Cyberload Fusion and 1 Overload Fusion. These cards help push for game by making Rampages, pretty self explanatory. I think Power Bond is actually better than either, and I'm considering cutting either or both of these, but I like running a lot of Cyber Dragon cards in the deck. That's the whole Cyber package.

For Machina cards, it's a pretty simple engine. The real Chad goal is to draw 1 or our 2 Redepoloyments and then use Megaform and Irradiator to summon Citadel. But Citadel can be revived from the GY if Regulus gets popped, or when Irradiator pops itself to summon Megaform. The idea is we have a few brickier cards, but also a lot of chances to put up Citadel while setting up for Regulus and searching Cyber Dragon. It's a 1 card thing that'll break a board pretty easily, though it isn't that helpful against Winda, it's a solid line to save for Splights after pushing through negations. Then we have 2 Regulus, 1 Disco. It's a free extra negate going first, and leads to the potential board of Infinity + Overflow + Regulus + Citadel. Pretty hard to push through that.

For hand traps, my goal was to settle on board breaking cards, but lean heavily on ones that could be set in the even I am going first. So there's 1 Jizikiru. It just makes sense to run in this pile, it's less about searching it and more about a free Kaiju being a early play going second in the deck. 3 Imperm and 3 Droplet - I think these cards are great going first or second, and should contribute to the deck's ability to break boards. I decided to run Lightning Storm over Raigeki or Cosmic in the main. it isn't as good in a grind game, and is outright bad (or at least usually dead) going first, but it flexes as a way to out floodgates while pressuring through (or blowing out_ negations.

Extra deck is mostly about making Rampage and Zeus going second, but Infinity is appealing going first, and it runs a single Durendal, which punishes searches but can also trigger Overflow while negating things, and is pretty good generic negation actually. Lyna is to search Cyber Dragons, Anger Knuckle is a recursive way to pitch cards and threaten Citadels, Sieger mostly enables Rampage plays, but also has a useful battle-protection effect, and Almiraj lets you put Core or Herz into the bin to enable Regulus plays, Repair Plant searches, and many other shenanigans, including their GY effects (though Core will almost always have to wait a turn).

3 Raigeki are super useful for targeting Spright and Tear boards, 3 Cosmic are for Mine and Floodgates, but are also sweet tech cards in a variety of matchups - the effect is deceptively strong if you use your head. After that I felt I was running enough cards to break boards and OTK going second, so the real switchup was going first cards. 3 D Barrier is an insane floodgate effect when you've set up your board, and after that I settled on the Solemn Brigade - Judgment because you need to protect all of your traps, and Strike because the card is also really good when you're going second, because sometimes pushing through and simplifying the game state then setting Overflow can be enough to clear the board once your Counter Trap ends the chain. The basic idea was to be as generic as possible with the blowouts and tech cards, with maybe the exception of the more targeted Raigeki, which is still generically pretty good, especially alongside Lightning Storm."

From there, Black Salvo can be used to recur a Deko and clear the board with Black Rose Dragon, then follow up with a powerful slew of traps to suppress the opponents board while the game is closed out with Chaos Sorcerer, Caius the Shadow Monarch, and Return from the Different Dimension. The deck has sufficient staying power, and the inherent 1-for-1 nature of the Chaos strategy is balanced by CA provided by Cyber Valley, Deko, Alchemist, and even Ryko, who can fuel the grave for Salvo, act as a LIGHT monster for Chaos Sorc, and of course, serve as catch-all removal. The rest of the deck boasts standard pieces for engagement and interaction, with Seven Tools and Solemn Warning as notable inclusions for their flexibility over Trap Stun and Solemn Judgement (with the latter still making an appearance in this list)."

Doing that and then sac it to play another monster that can attack and also do the same.
If your opponents make the mistake of letting you go through with our dear Farmer girl, it's GG 9/10 times, fetch whatever you need to ramp up you monster from level 3 to level 8 (you can skip some, don't worry) and look as your opponents' LP deplete to 0 while you still have like 1 or 2 summons and attacks to do.
The archetipe shtick is getting banished whenever you want, so use and abuse that!
A monster is getting removed? Throw it in the shadow realm and bring a spaceship to the field through whatever logic this game has! The evil opponent is making your new beautiful ship explode? Make him regret that by bringing [totally not genderbent darth vader for copyright reasons] or [totally not genderbent darth maul for copyright reasons] to the field and negate his stuff or lock the board because you can and you will.

The extra deck is definitely a thing, not something you really care about so do whatever you want with it."

i'm not playing other bricks (trains and regulus ...)  so i can run crossout as the deck can lose to one ash

BLS-beginning is good for OTKs, to get rid of powerful enemy monsters and can be used as ritual tribute.

For going second we have denko, ash blossom, kaiju engine, pankratops and eater of millions. Also i run other supports like pot of extravagance for draw power and cosmic cyclone mainly for banishing annoyimg floodgates the opponent might have (and its useful simce its a quick spell). I tried to krep the balance between going first and going second plays, while minimizing the contradictions between the cards. The only contradiction i have noticed is kaijus slumbers second effect that contradicts thunder king, necrovalley and deck lockdowns effects, but this effect will most likely not be used since most of time i wont need to search a kaiju, unless i dont have pieces to play."

as you know the cards and effects they have I will explain some combos which can help you

<hr />

THE USUAL FIRST-GOING BOARD COMBO

use circular send sigma to graveyard special summon circular than use sigma in the graveyard, special summon it back use Circular to add Mathmech super factorial than XYZ summon Alembertian to detach 2 materials to add Mathmech card from the deck to hand, which we usually add Diameter but if you already have it you can add Extender like Mathmech monster or Mathmech Equation.

normal summon Diameter to be special summon a Mathmech monster grom graveyard ( doesn't matter which one but keep XYZ monster on the field ) then link one of them into Link Disciple and link another monster into Link Devotee, use Alembertian ( the XYZ monster ) tribute Link Devotee than special summon any Mathmech monster than use the effect of Link Devotee to Special Summon 2 tokens than by using Link Disciple and one of the tokens Link summon Cyberse Wicckid, than by using XYZ and last token link summon I:P Masquerena than use Cyberse Wicckid effect to banish 1 cyber monster from GY to add any cyber tuner from the deck which usually is Diameter and for last by using your Mathmech monster link summon Linguriboh than set Mathmech super factorial.

During your opponent's turn use Mathmech super factorial to target up 3 Mathmech monsters including Diameter to XYZ summon Laplacian and you can use I:P to link summon Apollousa.

<hr />

THE MOST KNOWN OTK COMBOS ( SECOND-GOING BOARD)

1- ACCESS CODE(needs at least 3 cyber monsters on the field): Link Splash Mage --&gt; use its effect to summon 1 cyber monster from GY --&gt; Link Update Jammer --&gt; Link Transcode talker --&gt; to use its effect to summon Update Jammer --&gt; Link to summon Acesscode talker --&gt; Update Jammer chain link 1 Access code talker chain link 2

2 - Geomathmech Final Sigma(Mathmech Nabla + any other cyber monster): use Nabla's effect to tribute one other cyber monster you control to special summon Mathmech Multiplication then use Mathmech Multiplication double its level than synchro summon Geomathmech Final Sigma than use Nabla and Multiplication effect in the graveyard to double ATK point and the number of attacks

<hr />

now since we explained the combos time for SIDE DECK LESSONS

Nibiru: well like most of you know for the upcoming format playing Nibiru is a bad move but this deck can lose to Nibiru depending on saturation but a good cross-out target also for people who say Nibiru can't stop Spright true but again depending on the saturation.

Lightning Storm and Harpie's feather duster and Red reboot: To remove back rows it's necessary as you all know

Mind control + Change of heart: just to increase the control power of the deck no need to say both are still the best cards in-game

Dimensional barrier: this card can stop many decks like Swordsoul + Branded Despia + Tearalament + Spright and etc

The dark ruler no more: this card is 100% good, especially  in this format actually the powerful way to get rid of Spright full board in case you didn't draw any hand traps

Silent graveyard or new name forbidden graveyard: if you remember the Drytron Meta format this card was an amazing counter for Drytrons and now it's a good Side against Tearalament if they can't use any effect in their Graveyard they are dead because they can't mill or fusion summon.

basically, this was the best side deck I could ever make for the upcoming format.

<hr />

Hand Traps

Ash blossom + D.D. Crow + PSY-Framegear Gamma + Effect veiler + Infinite impermanence

1 effect veiler for cross-out effect well let's be honest impermanence is better than effect veiler but we need at least 1 effect veiler

this deck usually doesn't lose to ash blossom or d.d. crow  or impermanence or effect veiler, it depends on saturation

Hand traps this deck might lose against or 100% lose: Nibiru + Droll &amp; lock bird + PSY-Framegear Gamma + Ghost ogre + Ghost belle

but since in this upcoming format playing Droll and Nibiru and belle and Ogre is a bad move you might be in a good spot with this deck

<hr />

Last notes let's get over 6.000 views and help me break my record, and promise me 1 thing if you are going to play Mathmechs make sure to defeat everyone XD,

OK till the next deck list which is going to be Tearalaments.

Diviner + Halq make Elf to special Diviner to send Arc Light and search Benten.
Afterwards use the Geek Boy and Benten to go trough the Libromancer line.
The end board would be Spright Elf, Libromancer Doombroker + set Intervention, Baronne, set Scythe and Geek Boy (I:P if you have an extender).  You use the Elf on the opponents turn to special Diviner to send N'tss and pop the Scythe.
Jet, Dagda and Wonder Magician are there for if you get interrupted but can still make Halq.
I don't own Pot of Prosperity yet, but it would probably be a great include in the deck."

Common Questions

Q:Why only two pendulum calls? A: Usually Pendulum Call kind of ruins most combos by stopping Wisdom-Eye, Double-Iris Magician from being destroyed which is what you would usually want, however, you could bait the oppenent into negating it.

Have fun with it and let me know about your thoughts of it."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.

This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.

1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.

2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!

3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions

4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List
You can only have
3 Cards on the A Tier List
5 Cards on the B Tier List
10 Cards on the C Tier List
In your deck.
https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList

5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.

6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

7) Cards that have a (this card is always treated as ""card name"") can be ignored.
Example Harpie Lady 1, 2. And 3 are always treated as the original Harpie Lady.
In normal ocg/tcg you would have to choose the ratios from amongst them to play.
But here you can run the 3 original and then 1 of each other effect harpie.

Another instance of this is ""Umi"" and card like ""A legendary ocean""

Live/Evil Twin is my favourite Spright version in concept, aided by Ultimate Slayer/Artemate Slay and hyper-consistency. In the ","Live/Evil Twin is where I want to start in the new meta. While Tearalaments might be a better medium term investment, both of the new Tier decks are also liable to be splashed as engines for years to come - they're simply too good at what they do. They're also liable to get limited or banned. This version of Spright isn't as dependent on Toad, so if Toad goes the same way it did in the OCG this version remains very strong. However, Toad makes Spright Elf much stronger, and I will run it while it is legal,

There are basically 2 engines in the deck - the Spright engine, which easily puts up negates but locks us out non link/rank/level 2s, and the Live Twin engine, which draws cards and pops/sends cards, but locks us into fiends. Having said that, there are combos that put up Trouble Sunny with lots of negates, and combos that are happy to just put up Ki-Sikil with Elf, Red, Toad, and Carrot. Cool, flexible combos. Evil Twins is also much better in this deck than in any other deck - Live Twins can actually summon the card quite easily, and it will help but the numbers on the board, and has occasionally helped break a board or two. Having Evil Twins and Sunny in the deck also means the deck actually puts up attack points really easily, and has great lines to OTK.

Into the card by card.

3 Starter, 3 Blue, 3 Jet. I don't think you NEED to play full numbers of all of these, but these are the Spright starters, and I think in TCG I'm gonna start on all 3 of each. Starter plays through Droll if you activate before the main phase, so this card gets much better in TCG where Droll is one of the cards you see more often in the absence of Maximum ""C"". Blue and Jet are fine. They're full combo by themselves, and 9 Spright starters makes sense to start at (though I could see myself going as low as 7). 2 Red, 1 Carrot, none of the bad one. I just don't want to run a bad honest even in pure Spright, tbh, but at least there it makes sense as a searchable 1 of. In the Twin build it makes significantly less sense, since you can OTK way more easily and aren't counting on always seeing a Spright. 2 Red makes a lot of sense to me, not only am I happy seeing Red, but I'd like to search a second on follow-up sometimes. 1 Carrot is... Fine? A spell/trap negate that pops is actually pretty good, it insulates us from Imperm, and it is always useful, but I don't think I need or want a second to ever show up. 2 Spright Smashers makes a lot of sense, it's an out for floodgates that is also good removal and searchable, and realistically I already like Cosmic Cyclone and Paleo Dinomiscus, this is just those but better in every way. If you're smart with this card it gets much stronger, but also 1-for-1 removal is solid.

I'm also FOR SURE running 2 Ultimate Slayer, with bricks in the extra. Sending Toad can be cool and useful in the deck, but really we're trying to hit a Link, Synchro, or Fusion and get a free 2-for-1. Dogmatika cards already really helped Evil Twin, and people have started maining Evil Twins in weird decks to run this card, whereas here it is totally free. So, yes, in the main. Realistically, if it isn't Spright or Tearalaments I'm not too worried about having a dead card anyways, except against Exosister, which is a bad matchup going second either way, and still a pretty good matchup going first. The rest of the format is screwed, and Slayer is still good against most of it. I give it less than a month before everyone and their dog is on 1 Evil Twins with some Slayer main, but in our deck Twins is also an Engine card, a tool for creating OTKS, and a tool for breaking boards. The card is better (in Twins) than I think non-Twin players recognize, but it really does help hit the numbers, and it has helped force out interruptions for me, and occasionally even broken boards.

For other Twin engine cards, I'm on 3 Live Lil-La, 2 Live Ki-Sikil, 1 Ki-Sikil Frost, 3 Sunny's Snitch, and 1 Password. Lil-La is preferred to Ki-Sikil because summoning Frost is access to a free draw 1. The engine locks you into Fiends out of the Extra Deck, while the Sprights lock you into 2s, so you have to choose between using Toad and Trouble - Trouble to break boards, Toad to stop them from making them. They also enable Spright plays by themselves though, and Frost even literally helps make Toad. 3 Snitch is great, theoretically it could win you on time, but the LP actually matter reasonably often given the archetype's generally low ATK points. We only run 1 Password because realistically it should almost never want to search out Evil Twins and is nearly always going to just be more copies of Snitch that lose to Droll.

We're on Toad and still want to full Spright combo with the Twins sometimes, so we've got the whole Frog engine. These numbers are pretty standard, not much to say. Seeing a Swap Frog is fine-to-great and you need enough Frogs to send. Dupe screws up the plan of beating over Sprights and Twins. Ronintoaden enables the Toad plays.

For hand traps, I'm on 7 with another brick - 3 Ash, 3 Gamma with a Driver, and the obligatory Called By. Ash wins over Imperm here by being generically good at stopping milling, wheras Gamma wins by protecting early plays like Starter and Snitch, as well as being a Level 2 that summons itself out to enable combos.

In the extra deck, I have some bricks for Slayer - Wind Peg and Omega as options vs Synchro Monsters, and N'tss to deal with Fusions. The deck also naturally wants to run Sunny and Toad, which are also great sends for Slayer. The goal here is to get a targeted 2-for-1 off of Slayer to very Specifically break Spright and Tearalaments boards.

2 of each Evil Twin is just about perfect. Because we're on Slayer, I'd consider a 3rd Trouble, 2 to grind and 1 to send, but I think these numbers are fine, enabling some grind game with the Twins, but also being able to put up a good turn 1 board whatever we're locked into. Toad is our best negate, and Elf lets us loop it in addition to being a great grindy card. Gigantic Spright enables Toad lines and can also help OTK, but even when you're locked into Fiends you can still make sweet plays with Red, Carrot, and Djinn Buster with Trouble.

The side deck is very targeted - let's fuck up the end boards of Spright and Tearalaments, with a little extra focus on ending backrow and outing the Mine, with a little extra respect paid towards Branded Fusion versions of Tear, on the basis of Anti-spell really messing with that deck, but also just being deadly going first against pretty much every generic deck floating around the meta."
