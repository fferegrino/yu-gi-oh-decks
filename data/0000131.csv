Its a pretty interesting Deck, and I really like to play it :)

&nbsp;

Im happy to hear any recommendations on how to improve the Deck and make it even better.

Last but not least: Can it be Meta Relevant? I think in this form no. Its pretty hard to play around / against some actual Meta decks, and in my Opinon, its more of an Fun / Casual Deck, who can <em>maybe</em> go Rouge. Anyway, leave a comment and stay healthy! :D"

<a data-name=""Obelisk the Tormentor"">Obelisk the Tormentor</a> – A great divine-beast card with 4000 atk, to summon it you need alot of Token and special summons, then you can use the normal summon to summon Obelisk, <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a> that turned to <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> is the alternative, but it's not needed and already strong as a stall card that has to be targeted. With <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> you can tribute 2 opponent monsters and get 2 Torment-Token on your side which is really strong, but the effect has to destroy, so the opponent must have 3 monsters, otherwise you must tribute Obelisk or one of your monsters, because one target has to be left on the opponent's side for the effect.

This is a fairly fun mix of archetypes, as the milling of Lightsworns props the effects of the Shaddols and can lead into some strong fusions and Extra deck monsters to push for game. They also both have really cool lore, art, and theming.</span>
<span>Deck guide</span>

<span>3x General- General allows you to basically fill up your banished pile, and cripple an opponent's monster's stats by doing so, which is very helpful for running over problem monsters and for pushing for game mid to late game. </span>
<span>3x Raiden- Raiden is mainly used for it's strong mill, as all in all, it allows you to mill 4 cards during your turn, which can easily prop the effects of a ton of Lightsworns and Shaddols. It also loads up your grave yard for other plays, allowing you to do even more stuff.</span>
<span>3x Lumina- Lumina is a great card for extending the deck's plays and leading into XYZ and the usch, as you can banish normally non-special summonable Lightsworns from your hand to then re-special summon them. And, when another Lightsworn activates it's effect, you can mill 3. This is great with cards like Felis and Raiden, as with Felis it unclogs your hand and gives you removal with a mill of 6; with Raidin, it gives you a mill of 5 and can lead into either Curious or Michael. </span>
<span>1x Felis- Felis is best  to keep in deck to be milled or summoned off of Lumina. When milled, she allows you to special summon herself.   Felis gives you a pop for the opponent and  then mill's 3, activating a ton of Shaddol effects and filling up your grave. </span>
<span>1x Beast- Beast gives some small draw power when sent to the grave, which isn't major but still can be fairly nice. </span>
<span>2x Squamata- When it's sent, Squamata allows you to send more Shaddol cards from deck to grave. This is great because it activates their effects for whatever you need, and fills up your grave for later plays. </span>
<span>2x Wendi- Wendi helps with field swarming and getting more mosnters on board for fusions. You can also use the face downs to actually activate their flip effects sometimes, although you're better off just fusing them away. </span>
<span>2x Hedghehog- Hedghehog fetches all the Shaddol monsters you need for fusions and such, as it fills the gaps in your hand when sent to the grave. Hedghehog is generally pretty fantastic. </span>
<span>2x Keios- Keios helps to buff up your monsters when you're trying to push for game, as it helps to raise their attack stats to run over large monsters or deal a ton of damage. Additionally, Keios props the effects of other Shaddols. </span>
<span>3x Ryko- Ryko gives you non-targeting, non destruction removal at the small cost of banishing a Lightsworn (which can easily be got back by Lumina), which in the current game is fantastic. It also mills 3 when a Lightsworn activate's its effect, which is great for milling a ton. </span>
<span>3x Ash- You should know why I play this by know. </span>
<span>3x Charge- Charge is an amazing card in this deck and a staple 3 of. It's cost is pure plussing, as it mills three without taking up a summon and fills up your grave with propping Shaddol effects. And if it's uninterrupted, Charge adds a Lightsworn monster to fill in the gaps of your hand.</span>
<span>2x Solar Recharge- Solar Recharge is a great draw spell, as it's a nice draw 2 and mill's 2 to activate Shaddol effects, all at the cost of discarding a single Lightsworn (which is why it's at 2), which can be used to set up your grave for other plays. </span>
<span>3x Nephe- Nephe is a great card for summoning a lot of the Fusions, as it alters the attributes of your Shaddols so you can properly fuse into a lot of the Shaddol fusions that require specific attributes. Nephe also allows you to fuse into a Shaddol monster with the equipped monster and monsters on field/hand, going into beeg Shaddols. The fusion also props their ""going to grave"" effects, extending your plays.</span>
<span> 3x El Shaddol Fusion- El Shaddol Fusion is another fusion spell for the Shaddols, allowing you to go into more of the Shaddols, this time without having you summon one (unlike the equip). El is also a quick play, meaning you can fuse during either turn to interrupt your opponent's plays heavily. </span>
<span>Extra deck</span>

<span>2x Michael- Michale is fairly easy to go into, with a Raiden and another Lightsworn (most likely a Lumina, depending on your opening hand). Michael is great for non-destruction removal, as while it does target, it banishes, not destroys. Michael also allows you to recycle any number of Lightsworns into the deck from grave and gain a miniscule 300 LP for each, mills 3 during the end phase, and is a 26k beater.</span>
<span>2x Minerva- Minerva starts off with a simple effect of detaching a material to mill 3, which is great for propping the effects of Shaddols to extend your plays and make some fusions. And when Minerva is destroyed by battle or card effect, it mills 3 and destroys opponent's cards (without targeting) equal to the number of Lightsworns you milled with it, which can be great for blowing up the board so you can launch a comeback. Minerva is generally simple, but solid.</span>
<span>2x Curious- Curious is fairly hard to make, but can be completely worth it. On destruction, it bounces a card from your grave back to your hand, recycling resources.On summon, it sends any card from your deck to the grave, not just from the top, making Curious a foolish burial on legs. It also easily props the Shaddols without leaving it up to luck. Additionally, when a card is sent from the deck to the grave (whether it be by milling or by Curious' own Foolish burial), you can mill the top 3. </span>
<span>1x Shekhinga- Shekhinga is a negate on legs, which for this deck is great, as it doesn't have many negates. Shekhinga can negate special summoned monster effects by your opponent by sending Shaddol cards from your hand to the grave, which is actually a great cost, as it generates advantage for you by negating. Shekhinga also recovers Shaddol spells when sent to the grave.</span>
<span>1x Anoytalis- Anoytalis is more so a floodgate on legs, as it makes it so your opponent can't special summon monsters from hand or grave using spells/traps. This sounds oddly specific, but can be quite strong against some match ups. Like others, it recovers Shaddol spells/traps (i'm not going to always say this so this is your last time hearing my beautifal text line say it).</span>
<span>3x Construct- The main boss monster of the deck, Construct is fantastic. On summon, it fills up your grave with the Shaddols and activates their effects, extending your plays even more and filling up your grave. When Construct battles a Special Summoned monster, it destroys it without counting in battle damage, whcih is amazing since most boss monsters are special summoned. </span>
<span>1x Grysta- Grysta is a great negate on legs, as whenever your opponent would summon a monster, you can send a Shaddol card to negate the summon and destroy the monster. Like Shekinga, this is amazing, as it's a negate that generates you more advantage. </span>
<span>1x Wendigo- Wendigo is mainly here to wall up, but if i'm gonna be honest, also because I find her adorable. Not actually a very good card but too cute to pass up.</span>
<span>1x Winda- Winda is an amazing floodgate that's easy to summon in the deck, due to all the dark's. Each player can only summon one mosnter while she's face up, which, while it does hurt us, still is a great monster to drop on an end board so the opponent can barely do anything or has to dedicate resources to getting rid of it.</span>
<span>1x Alkapone- Alkapone allows you to basically permanently effect veiler a card, negating it's effects for the rest of the game, which is great for outing problem cards like Appolousa. It also has battle protection (which isn't super important but makes it annoying to deal with), and when it's sent to grave, it allows you to add any Shaddol card from deck to hand, then discard a card.</span>
<span>Deck guide</span>

<span>The deck's main strategy is to go first, mill a ton of cards, and set up an endboard of some fusions/synchros/ whatever you can get out.You'll want to Summon your main mill cards like Raiden, whether it be normal summoning them or summoning them off of Lumina. Afterwards, you should mill a ton to activate Shaddol effects and search and the such, allowing you to refill your hand, summon more monsters, etc. Then you can go into a Michael, Curious, etc, and then fuse your remaining Shaddols into a fusion. Afterwards, the deck just gets really grindy and just mills until it decks out or beats the shit out of the opponent with the big extra deck monsters. </span>
<span>(Things to note: This is mainly a going first deck, and Mystic Mine is a good option to replace Desires with in some match ups.) </span>
<span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated, as always. Have a good day!</span>"

It's a going first control deck, oriented on making sure the opponent isn't allowed to do anything the entire time and then wittling their life points down slowly. Credit to the dude who's trying way too hard to be like TeamSam, AKA Yugituber  for giving me the idea. Also, this utilizes the OCG support so you may have to wait to play the full deck.
Ratio update: Cut 1 Black Awakening for an extra Eldland. Also just now realized this is technically meta because of Eldlich.
Update 2: Cut 1 Nepnethes and 1 Conquistador for a Sangquine. You're welcome TeamSam but worse.</span>
<span>Deck guide</span>

<span>3x Eldlich the Golden Lord- The main boy, he's finally dropped a lot in price, making this deck (somewhat) more budget friendly in some places. Anyway, Eld is great, as he gives non-destruction removal for a ton of your opponent's problem cards and sets up your grave. Additionally, he has a great special summoning condition that's easy to fulfill and loads up your grave with spells and traps to recover later. Also, he gives off the vibes of a JoJo's villain. Someone, please give him a Stand. </span>
<span>3x Atrax- Atrax helps a lot with your Holes (hee hee), as it allows you to activate them from the hand, meaning you don't have to set them and have them sitting there and be hit by S/T removal. She also makes it so your your Hole's can't be negated, which is also great, considering the current format is very heavy with negates like Gamma. </span>
<span>2x Dionea- Dionea recovers the monsters you need, helping to build up into the XYZ or links to build up your backrow and such mid to late game. Additionally, when it's special summoned, it recovers all the Hole's you've used or sent for Eldlich, allowing you to reuse them even more and pressure your opponent. </span>
<span>3x Myrmeleo- Myrmeleo fetches most of the traps you need, so you can set up your backrow and/or provide fodder for Eldlich in order to get him out onto the field and set up your grave. Additionally,  if it's special summoned, it can pop some  backrow, which can be helpful in some situations. </span>
<span>3x Mantis- Mantis searches out all the Traptrix monsters you need for your plays, mainly Ginalloa since Mantis takes up your normal summon. Additionally, Mantis allows you to bounce back your dead backrow in order to replace it with better backrow that's of use. </span>
<span>3x Ginalloa- One of the new pieces of OCG support, Ginalloa helps greatly with swarming the field and going into the XYZ/Links. Her first effect allows you to send backrow to grave to special summon her, which can set up your grave with Eldlich backrow and such. Additionally, she can banish herself from grave to re-set backrow from the grave. Although, you can only do one of these effects once per turn, which is a bit annoying.</span>
<span>2x Genlisea- Genlisea is a great card for setting up huge amounts of backrow mid-to late game, in case your opponent is trying to push to make a board, so you can force them into your favored gamestate. Genlisea tributes herself to set 2 Hole traps with different names, one from deck and one from grave, which is great for recovering resources and setting up a huge backrow. </span>
<span>3x Nephetes- Nephetes helps a lot with swarming the field as you activate the Holes, as when you activate a Hole she allows you to special a Traptrix from deck, helping to swarm the field and lead into link and XYZ plays. </span>
<span>2x Cursed Eldland- Cursed Eldland searches out Eldlich and all of his backrow for a miniscule cost of life points, which is a great effect for filling the gaps in your hand. Additionallky, when it leaves the field, it allows you to set Eldlich backrow directly from deck, which is also fantastic. </span>
<span>3x Black Awakening- Black Awakening helps with getting out Eldlich as fast as possible, and it helps as it doesn't require his cost of sending backrow to grave. It can also let you get multiple Eldliches onto field, which is great. And you can banish it from the grave to set a Golden Land trap directly from deck to backrow, helping heavily with the control focus. Although, you can only use on of these effects per turn, so it's your choice. You can set a Black Awakening and send it off of Eldlich and then banish Black Awakening for it's set, so that's a pretty cool combo. Also, for budget decks, you can replace this with White Destiny. </span>
<span>3x Trap Hole Nightmare- Trap Hole Nightmare is more so a backrow Effect Veiler, as it's insurance in case your opponent gets through your Trap Holes. When they try to activate their monster effects, you can punish them and interrupt them even more. </span>
<span>3x Bottomless Trap Hole- Bottomless Trap Hole is one of the deck's main backrow, as it's heavily searchable and recyclable. You want to constantly use it on your opponent's monsters, making sure they waste resources on plays and then you completely disrupt those plays. </span>
<span>2x Gravedigger's- Gravedigger's heavily counters hand traps, GY decks, and banishing decks, as whenever your opponent activates a card in hand, GY, or a banished card, you can negate it and inflict 2000 burn. 2000 burn is massive for a deck that runs small monsters and has to chip away at the opponent, and Gravedigger's can protect your plays from hand traps or can compeletely stop GY decks. </span>
<span>2x Golden Land Forever!- Golden Land Forever is one of the deck's main negates, as you can tribute an Eldlich to negate any effect. This is fantastic for more heavy interruptions, and the cost of tributing Eldlich isn't very major because of how heavily recycable Eldlich is. Additionally, it's heavily searchable in the deck. </span>
<span>3x Conquistador- Conquistador serves as a wall of 1800, and heavily interrupts your opponent's plays as long as you have Eldlich out on the field, as it allows you to destroy one of the opponent's cards, without targeting, which is great in the current meta. and you can banish it to set a Eldlixer spell directly from deck, allowing you to swarm the field with even more Eldliches. You can only use one of these effect's per turn, but it's still great. </span>
<span>The extra deck</span>

<span>3x Allomerus- Allomerus helps to recover monsters and build up your board heavily, which can allow you to build up into the links and push for game mid- to late game once your opponent has exhausted all of their resources. You can detacth 2 materials from Allo to special a Traptrix from grave, which is pretty nice for leading into Sera for more plays. Additionally, if an opponent's monster is destroyed/banished by one of our card effects, you can steal it with no restrictions. That's amazing, as you can easily steal a huge monster. </span>
<span>2x Rafflesia- Rafflesia gives complete protection to all your Traptrix (except itself) from battle and card effects, which is great due to their low stats and lack of built in protection. Additionally, Rafflesia allows you  to load up your grave with Hole traps and copies their effects, making it a Hole on legs and can completely force the gamestate into your favor. </span>
<span>2x Urticularia- Urticularia allows you to re-use all your trap holes, as they reset themselves instead of going to the grave. There is no restrictions on this, which is amazing, as it allows you to keep a strong backrow and not have to recur your resources from grave. And, during the end phase, it has a Gantala style effect, where it specials a Traptrix from grave, which helps a lot with field swarming. </span>
<span>3x Sera- Sera is annoyingly expensive, but completely worth it. When you activate the Holes, you can special a Traptrix from deck, which can lead to a huge amount of Traptrix on grave and can lead to a ton of field presence and a massive board depending on how your turn goes. Additionally, when another Traptrix monster activates it's effect, you can set a Hole straight from deck to the backrow, which is also great for setting up a huge board/backrow.</span>
<span>2x Pheonix- Pheonix is pretty much just here to make use of some of the swarming potential you can have, and to clear backrow when neccesary. Also here to fill the extra deck.</span>
<span>2x Unicorn- Unicorn is a solid card for mid-to late game when you have a good amount of monsters on the field for a Link summon, so you can get the opponent's monsters out of the way in order to push for game.</span>
<span>Playing guide</span>

<span>So, the deck is mainly a going first control/stun deck, although that should be obvious. You want to go first and use your normal summon on something like Myrmello or whichever Traptrix you have in hand at the time, in order to set up your field and get off their effects. Afterwards, you want to use Eldlich's effect to summon himself (or search him or summon him directly from the deck), and then set up your backrow. After that, you simply just Trap Hole everything the opponent tries and make sure they can't do anything, also forcing them to expend their resources on trying to push through, and then negating the push with things like Golden Land Forever. Mid- to late game, once you've set up a board, you want to link it away into the Traptrix Links and overlay some into the XYZ, and use the Extra Deck Traptrix to grind out the game until you finally wittle them down and push for game. </span>
<span>(things to note: This deck hates going first, and Mystic Mine is something you should use in the side deck for some match ups.)</span>
<span>Any suggestions or anything is appreciated. Thank you for reading!</span>"

Your main boss monster is Magician of Chaos, but you can also bring out Chaos MAX Dragon or Magician of Black Chaos MAX

&nbsp;

This deck doesn't use Dragoon because I dislike that card even though it would probably make this deck a bit stronger. Besides, the main focus isn't on the Extra Deck

&nbsp;

Your main way to summon your ritual (and some fusion monsters) is by using Secrets of Dark Magic which you can search with Magician's Rod. You can also use classic ritual support (Manju, Impcantation, Preperation of Rites etc.)  need to get what you need.

&nbsp;

With Eternal Soul you can revive DM or CoM, after it is destroyed or tributed

&nbsp;

If you activate CoM's effect on opponent's turn you can destroy Artifact Scythe to prevent your opponent from using the Extra Deck

&nbsp;

Extra Deck is made out of generic DM and not-DM cards which you can bring out relatively easy considering that the Extra Deck isn't that important for the deck (besides maybe Dark Magicians and Ebon Illusion). So don't worry about Extravigance. But I did add Quintet and Magicalized Fusion to flex on people :)"

Well... this deck is quite complicated and luck-based because there are only few generic ritual cards and there are only 4 ritual spells.

I even thinking that this deck won't have a bright future but after testing it in several conditions, it still can do quite well.

So i present to you... the ""perfect"" combination of Impcantation, vendread, and Megalith.

The strategy is a bit complicated but after you master it, this deck will be unstoppable.

the strategy is using every cards in your hand and don't summon 2 copies of the same cards (for Megaliths and Impcantations)"

Also, by the way, my posts and such might be sparratic for the rest of this month; busy with the holidays. </span>
<span>Deck guide</span>

<span>3x Analyzer- Analyzer is the main starter card for the Adamancipator, as his special summoning  condition is easy. As long as you search him or see him in your opening hand, you can special him to proc the other's effects to special the rest. That leaves your Normal Summon open for the Sky Strikers, who need it. Aditionally, Analyzer does the funky excavation, to search out and special the rocks for quick synchros. </span>
<span>2x Seeker- Seeker is another one of the Adamancipator's, which you want to special summon off of having Anaylzer on the field and SS'd, so you can special summon Seeker easily. Then, like Analyzer, you can excevate and get out even more rocks for more synchros. </span>
<span>2x Researcher- Like Seeker, Researcher is very easy to get out as long as you've gotten off Analyzer and Seeker. And like the others, she does the funky excavation and special summoning of the rocks, allowing you to go into more synchros quickly and build up your board. </span>
<span>2x Leonite- Leonite is the first crystal, and allows you to recover your Ada resources, albeit slowly, as you put the GY ones on top of the deck (you will never be putting ones from the hand on top). It also allows you to bounce back Leonite 2: Electric Boogaloo to topdeck itself, but that's a really bad effect. </span>
<span>2x Dragite- When being summoned by one of the excevation effects, it draws a card, which is pretty nice as long as you top deck something to extend plays. Similarly to Leonite, it allows you to bounce back Dragite 2: Electric Boogaloo to the extra deck to top deck itself, but that's still a really bad effect.</span>
<span>1x Raptite- On summon of an excevation effect, it allows you to topdeck one of the Adamancipator's in your grave, so it's a slower revival effect basically. And, like the rest, he has the shitty bounce effect. </span>
<span>3x Raye- Raye is one of the key cards of the Sky Striker strat, as it's also the deck's main normal summon. It leads straight into any of the Links, and on summon, can also get out Roze alongside herself for either a link-2 or two Sky Strikers. And in the grave, it can (slowly) recover itself if one of your Links is destroyed, to lead into another Sky Striker link. </span>
<span>3x Roze- As long as you normal summon a Raye, you can special out a Roze alongside her. Roze allows you to either go into Zeke, or two Sky Striker link-1's, which is quite nice to all have out for field swarming capabilites. And when an opponent's monster in the Extra Monster zone leaves the field, she can special summon herself and negate a opponent's monsters effect. While this can be more situational due to us being in Master Rule 5, it's still fairly strong.</span>
<span>3x Gamma- Gamma is the deck's main hand trap, as it can negate literally anything and get a body on the field doing so. The main drawback of Gamma is that it requires a garnet (Driver), but Driver at 1 means it's rare to draw into it and easier to use Gamma and recycle Driver. </span>
<span>1x Driver- A shitty garnet for Gamma. It doesn't even look cool like other Garnets. </span>
<span>3x Lapuite- Lapuite is the deck's main field spell, but can be swapped out for Mystic Mine in some situations if neccesary. Lapuite boosts the already fairly strong power of your Adamancipators, allowing you to do high damage. Additonally, after you perform your combos and such, you can top deck 5 Adamancipator cards to make even more Synchros and such if your opponent still isn't dead after that turn.</span>
<span>3x Friends- Friends is the deck's main searcher for the Adamancipators, as it allows you to get whichever Rock you need that's excevated. Friends can be a bit of a pain, as you need a few Rocks out to use it optimally, but it's still fairly solid. Although, Friends is also xenophobic, locking you into Rocks for the rest of the turn, meaning you need to do your Sky Strikers first. Some variants may want to cut down on the Friends, if they're going more heavily into the Sky Strikers. </span>
<span>2x Signs- Signs allows you to revive your monsters or extend your plays, whichever you need. You can revive your fallen Adamancipator Synchros that you actually want on the field, that were destroyed or something of the sort, to re-activate their effects and such. Or you can use it to re-summon the monsters you used for a synchro summon, in order to extend your plays. </span>
<span>1x Multirole- Multirole allows you to give your spells protection, which is a great effect since the Spells are really vital for the Sky Striker strategy. Additionally, it allows you to set a ton of spells from your grave during the end phase, which, depending on the combos you did, can be a huge set up and can heavily interrupt the opponent's plays. </span>
<span>2x Afterburners- Afterburners gives some fairly nice monster removal to get rid of the opponent's monsters and clear the field for an OTK. It also allows you to remove some backrow if it's fairly late into the Spell cycle. </span>
<span>1x Hornet Drones- Hornet Drones allows you to get out a token for a quick Link, adding onto the amount of Sky Striker Link field swarming you can get in order to have a quick OTK and/or grind out the game. </span>
<span>3x Shark Cannon- Shark Cannon allows you to get your opponent's key combo pieces out of play in order to heavily interrupt their plays, which is a great and solid effect on a quick play (which you can set with Multirole to fuck them over when they try making a comeback). Additionally, if you're heavily into the spell cycle, you can steal the monster. </span>
<span>3x Widow Anchor- Widow Anchor is basically a better Effect Veiler, allowing you to negate a problem monster's effects and get it out of the way in order to make your plays easier to pull off. Additionally, as long as you use Widow Anchor late into the spell cycle, you can steal the monster with no restrictions (aside from being destroyed in the end phase), meaning if it's a high attack monster you can easily push for game with it. You can also set it with Multirole to heavily interrupt your opponent's plays. </span>
<span>Extra deck
</span>

<span>Dragite- Dragite is the deck's main Synchro boss monster, that you want to focus on getting out with the Adamancipators. It allows non targeting, not destruction removal, just by excevating cards (which benefits you) which in the current game is absolutely amazing and can clear out entire boards. And, as long as you have the original main deck Dragite in the grave, you can negate any card effect your opponent activates, which is also amazing. </span>
<span>2x Leonite- Leonite allows you to search and is basically an archetypal Rota, being a Friend's with much less restrictions. Additionally, during the opponent's turn, as long as you have the original Leonite in the grave, you can special any Rock monster. This allows you to even recover the Synchros or extend plays, which is great. </span>
<span>1x Raptite- Raptite allows you to get out more Rock monsters onto the field, helping to Synchro climb into Dragite. Additionally, during the opponent's turn, as long as you have the original Raptite in the grave, you can banish an opponent's card from the grave, which can heavily interrupt plays. </span>
<span>2x Kagari- Kagari allows you to recover your important spells and re-use them, recurring resources with ease. Kagari also grows to be a big beater as long as you have spells in the grave, which you should have. </span>
<span>2x Kaina- Kaina gives you a psuedo attack stun, which isn't super helpful, but can be somewhat helpful in some situations when you need to launch a comeback. She also gives you a very small LP recovery when you activate a Sky Striker spell, although that can add up to a big number. </span>
<span>2x Shizuku- Shizuku cripples the opponent's board, as you should have tons of spells in the grave, making it much easier to run over and finish the game. Additionally, it can search out the Sky Striker spells you need for your next turn if your opponent isn't dead by then. </span>
<span>2x Zeke- Zeke is the deck's main link-2, which is made with Roze and Raye instead of just Raye. He gives you easy, non destruction removal, which is really strong. Additionally, Zeke can gain high levels of attack, growing even stronger for an OTK. </span>
<span>2x Hayate- Hayata can attack directly, which is fantastic for the deck, as it allows you to chip away at the opponent and help with finishing them off. Additionally, Hayate can send a Sky Striker spell from grave once it attacks, providing more fodder and set up for Multirole.</span>
<span>Playing guide</span>

<span>The deck mainly operates with activating the Sky Striker spells immediately, as at the start of their turn they shouldn't control any main zone monsters. Afterwards, you need you summon out Analyzer and get out the other Adamancipator's by their conditions. Then, you normal summon out the Ace's. And after excevating heavily and setting up your board, you can link away the Ace's into the Link's to prop their effects, and Synchro climb into the Synchros. After that, you want to continually attack at your opponent non-stop, until you grind them down. </span>"

What I found with testing is that Simorgh, Bird of Bringing is a one card tribute summon. You summon it to the field and use it's effect to search for the field spell Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh. You than use the field spell to allow you to tribute summon a monster for one less monster and than use its other effect to summon that one by tributing Simorgh, Bird of Bringing."

When you are trying to link climb the mean goal is to get as many link summoning's as possible. the mean goal is to quickly get quantum out then use wikid to link climb from your hand using the hand link condition cards. So first you wanna draw balance lord and cyberse gadget and then summon balance lord and use his effect to summon gadget then you wanna link to wikid and use gadget effect to ss token to a zone kid point to then use kid effect to banish balance lord and balance lord will let you add the cyberse synchron then use link kid toss that tuner and synchro to level 3 tuner then use level 3 tuner effect to ss cyberse sychron back then use cyberse synchron effect to double synchros level then go into quantum. Then you gonna want to use your hand effects to link to transcode then use micro code to add optimization then you can use trans to get back kid and link to accescode.

This deck is not quite fully done yet but you yourself after using it a bit could make your own changes to it to make it even better. This deck does great against synchro decks in general because of some of  the effects of Meklord monsters that specifically target synchro monsters. In this deck there are 3 main monster. Depending on the deck you are facing against makes the decision of what boss monster you want to use. So pay attention to your opponent in the first round. In this deck you can otk. But takes a while to learn this deck and make it good to the point your opponent gets scared because of how much attack is being done. There's really no strat you just have to learn how to use this deck the way you like playing yugioh. Enjoy(:"

I've been trying to make a real Kaiju Deck that can be effective for a while now. All the decks I've found that had Kaiju in the description just had like 2 Kaijus max (not a Kaiju deck to me sorry). This started out as a control deck. It still has some of the control elements but with the fossil cards it now also has some agression behind it. The White Aura Whale is supposed to be Fossil Machine Skull Convoy. I've been having a lot of success with this deck lately, the it's only downsides are that when you get somewhat of a dead hand (which doesn't happen often but still) it bricks big time! That's why I added pot of desires for draw power, although I wish I could have picked something else because there is always the danger that you can banish some key card that you need right now by accident (and also because of the pot this deck is 41 cards, which the perfectionist in me kind of hates...). The main strategy should be to not go overboard, but be agressive at the right moment. The Fossil Fusion Monsters can deliver OTKs pretty quickly, so if you put them on the field at the right moment and have some Kaiju here and there as well you are good to go (I love to have Gameciel with Waterfront together with Skull Convoy on the field, it's such a good and simple board). About the side deck: I do have some cards in there but some of the are just fillers and I'm not really sure what would be best to put there (also I couldn't figure out how to add cards to the side deck in this Deck Builder ooops). Anyways, I hope ya'll like it and are able to have fun with this deck, especially those people that really wanted a deck that makes Kaijus shine."

1st herald of the ultimateness

2nd vanity's ruler

these 2 cards are so good i do not even think about archetype bosses. They are like not a win condition but really good cards.

ok now how to do a 3+ negate herald of the ultimateness

first of all you need benten and a level 1 draitron to tribute it

let's say you have benten and aldibah in your hand
activate aldibah tribute benten, benten search herald of the ultimateness, aldibah search ritual spell activate ritual spell tribute aldibah summon herald of the ultimateness. if you don't like this you can always search diviner of the heralds by tributing benten. normal summon diviner --&gt; effect send herald of the arclight to the graveyard --&gt; herald of the arclight effect search ultimateness od the ritual spell whatever you want.

i said a lot about benten and you can ask
-ersander how do you get benten?
+thuban searches benten, preparation of rites searches benten, and benten searches benten :)

so basically there are 9 bentens in this deck and 1 benten is 3 bentens

ok now ultimateness is on the field and what?

ultimateness is not a once per turn card it can activate as many times as you want but resources for herald are limited. the best resource is eva which is a level 1 light fairy. since it is a light fairy benten can search it and it is a level one so where arf thou searches too. eva is basically 3 negates with ultimateness

ultimateness eff --&gt; send eva --&gt; eva eff --&gt; banish 2 search 2 --&gt; now you have 2 more negates for the ultimateness

that concludes the first win condition

now is the time for my favorite win condition V A N İ T Y ' S    R U L E R

summon 2 level 1 draitron and tribute summon vanity's ruler . END OF THE DUEL

last but not least archetype bosses

While the impcantation engine helps search the boss monster, Blue-eyes Chaos max

steps:
<ul>
 	<li>Summon<a data-name=""knightmare corruptor Iblee""> knightmare corruptor Iblee</a> into <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> to stop nibiru and <a data-name=""infinite impermance"">infinite impermanence</a> and special summon Ecclesia to search Fleurdelis for an interruption for your opponent's turn.

 	<li>Use Impcantations to Ritual summon for <a data-name=""Blue-eyes Chaos Max"">Blue-eyes Chaos Max</a>. and set Dogmatika Punishment to interrupt your opponents plays or to search using Herald of the Arc light</li>
</ul>
The deck needs some help from dogmatikas/Hearld to search the required materials to ritual summon as well as to provide interaction during your opponent's turn.

Conclusion:

the deck is really fun to play, I feel that this decklist requires a bit more fine-tuning. The deck can brick but has multiple routes to go to if you cannot open knightmare iblee or put a blue-eyes white dragon card on the field. It can easily win games because people forget that chaos MAX can do double piercing damage and is basically unaffected by card effects."

Sometimes I am able to build 7-9 level Synchros but I don't have them in the Extra Deck. I think this way allows me to play different level Extra Deck Monsters, depending on which of the many Penguins are on my field.

I now have 9 Tuners which gives me more versatility.

I haven't played this variation of the deck yet, so this is more of a placeholder of the cards I would like to throw into it. Let me know if you have any tips on what you would do with these potential cards in a deck?"

I'm actually a big fan of classical comic book heroes and such so the archetype does appeal to me, although I do hate some of their designs, as they're just roided out and have no effort put into them. But, they still have a fun play style and give me a lot of nostalgia. This is a more ""protect the castle"" type build centered around Dark Law, where you want to go first, summon out Dark Law, and protect him for as long as possible. Fun fact: Me and Toon are eldritch horrors from beyond the comprehension of time and space.
Update: Added in the Xtra Heroes and replaced Diamond Dude with E-Call.
<span>Deck guide
<span>2x Plasma- Plasma is a fairly strong card to end off with, although it can be a bit situational due to requiring 3 monsters to summon. Though, it is worth it, as he is a Skill Drain on legs and can grow to be a big beater if you're going second, making Plasma a solid card to use for end boards.
2x Malicious- the most we can run as of now, Malicious is a great card for swarming the field. There's a good amount of cards in the deck that dump Heroes to grave, like Faris, so you can easily dump a Malicious and then banish it to get out another Malicious for more fodder. Additionally, Malicious is a D-hero, giving it synergy with Fusion Destiny since that makes it even easier to dump into the grave and plus off of it. It's also a great target for Mask Change.
</span></span>

<span>3x Diamond Dude- One of the older D-heroes, Diamond Dude is a fairly solid (see what I did there?) card. While he is slow, he can still set up your grave and gives you a spell effect to activate at any time on your next turn, which is fantastic. He's a bit slow for the current game though, so depending on your build you might want to cut down on the Diamond Dudes.
3x Honest Neos- Honest Neos helps a lot with the ""protect the castle"" style of the deck. The main flaw of Dark Law is that he has low attack, which makes it a bit annoying to use him. Honest Neos makes up for that, as whenever your opponent tries to attack him or anything, you can boost Dark Law's attack to avoid him being destroyed.
3x Solid Soldier- Solid Soldier helps a lot with field swarming, as on summon, he specials out another Hero to the field, which can activate their effects (namely Dark Mist) and, when sent to grave when used for a fusion, it specials out another monster from grave, allowing for great resource reccursion.
3x Shadow Mist- Shadow Mist searches out the key cards of the deck, Mask Change, on special summon. That clause makes it a bit annoying to use, but it's still fine because it can be used off of cards like Solid Soldier to search. And when sent to the grave, it adds a Hero to hand. You can only use one of these effects per turn, but it's still solid, as that makes it a great target for either Solid Soldier, Faris, or a fusion spell.
3x Stratos- On summon, Stratos searches out a majority of the deck, which is a fantastic effect, as it fills the gaps in your hand for more plays. It can also remove backrow, but the searching is much better than the backrow removal.
3x Faris- Faris fills up the grave with Heroes that you want in the grave, like Malicious, to easily swarm the field and get more board presence. It also allows you to load up your backrow with more Vision heroes, for more effects.
3x Vyon- Vyon sets up your grave for more plays, likely Malicious for more field presense and fodder for fusions and Dark Law. Vyon has another effect to banish a Hero from grave to search Poly, but this deck doesn't run regular Poly in favor of  of archetypal fusion spells.
1x Increase- Increase is a nice card to have in the grave, to discourage the opponent from attacking until they manage to get it away.  Increase is better off getting from the deck by the effect of Varis, though, as it allows you to tribute Faris and get itself onto the field. On summon, it specials another Hero from deck, for more field presence and swarming.
3x Ash- Ash is a staple a hand trap in basically any modern deck deck, as it cripples tons of combos and strategies and can entirely end them, as most modern decks rely on searching.
3x Fusion Destiny- One of the deck's main fusion spells, it's used to turbo out the Destiny Heroes since it uses materials from the deck, which is great to get them out as fast as possible.  Although it does destroy them, it's slow to destroy them and you can quickly close off the game in that time as long as you get a high attack monster.
3x Mask Change-  Mask Change is another one of the deck's key cards, that you want to get as fast as possible, whether it be drawing into it from your starting hand or searching it off of Mist. Mask Change allows you to turbo into Dark Law for the control and ""protect the castle"" focus, or another one of the Masked Heroes depending on what attribute you have out.
2x Mask Change II- Mask Change II is basically the overcomplicated back up Mask Change, which we use in case we're out of Mask Changes or if we need extra extra copies of it.
3x Desires- Desires is the deck's main draw spell, as it's a more balanced Pot of Greed to draw 2 and banisht he top 10. While banishing the top 10 sucks and you run the risk of banishing some important cards, it's easy to use Desires after your search plays or to simply risk it.
<span>Extra Deck
<span>2x Dystopia- Dystopia is another target for Fusion Destiny, as it gives you some burn damage on the opponent (which can be large depending on your graveyard setup), and when you boost it with Honest Neos, you get a simple but helpful pop, which it becomes a 28k beater afterwards.
</span><span>2x Dangerous- Dangerous allows you to load up the grave with tons of Destiny Heroes, and boost to a much higher leveled attack for a big beater and get some graveyard setup. </span></span></span>

<span>1x Dominance- Dominance is a big 29k beater, who can alter the opponent's deck to top deck something useless at the time and fuck with their plays. It also gives you draw power on monster destruction, and on destruction, brings back basically allt he monsters you used for it's fusion, so it can bring more fodder for even more fusions.
1x Dusktopia- Dusktopia is a bit hard to get out normally, but is A) Compeltely worth it, and B) Fusion Destiny makes it so much easier to get out than it would normally be. On summon, it allows you to fusion summon another Fusion, helping to swarm the field with big monsters. Aditionally, it can give protection to your other monsters, although your opponent takes no damage from it, which is a pain. Dusktopia is also a 3k beater.
3x Dark Law- Dark Law is the deck's main boss monster, and the only fusion monster at 3. Dark Law banishes all cards sent to the grave, which can cripple nearly all modern strategies, as nearly all of them rely on the graveyard for plays. Aditionally, when your opponent searches a card, it banishes a card from your opponent's hand at random, also crippling their hand. You mainly want to protect Dark Law due to his low attack, mainly using Honest Neos to avoid him being destroyed if your opponent even gets close to that.
1x Blast- Blast is a good target for Mask Change on Stratos, and can cripple a big beater so you can properly beat over it. Aditionally, you can pay a small amount of life points in order to bounce back backrow, crippling decks like Altergeist.
1x Koga- Koga is a target for cards like Honest Neos,and was originally a target for Adjusted Gold, but I cut Adjusted Gold. Koga, similar to purgatrio, grows to be a big beater against swarm decks and punishes decks like D-link that build huge boards. Aditionally, it can cripple the attack of some monsters by banishing a hero from grave to  beat over problem monsters.
1x Dian- Dian is a target for cards like Solid Soldier, and at a nice 28k attack, it can beat over lots of stuff. When it does, it can special a level 4 or lower Hero from deck, allowing you to extend your plays into main phase 2.
1x Anki- Anki is basically a more aggresive alternative for Dark Law, in mid to late game when you need to finish off the game. Anki has a solid attack, meaning it can beat over monsters easily to search out a Mask Change when it destroys them, and can also attack directly with halved attack in case you need a small amount of damage to finish the game. Dark Law is superior to Anki though, and is priority.
1x Divine Wind- Divine Wind is a psuedo attack lock on some swarm decks, and gives you draw power when it destroys monsters by battle. Not much more to say here.
<span>Playing guide</span></span>

The deck's main goal is to turbo out Fusions, namely Dark Law, but it can also get out some more fusions alongside Dark Law to build up damage and board presence to pressure the opponent, alongside Dark Law's powerful control effects. To achieve this, you want to go through some usual combos; your normal summon will usually be Stratos or Solid, to search or gain field presense. If you do Solid, you want to special out Mist to get out one of the most important cards in the deck, Mask Change. Afterwards, you can use Special Summoning cards like Faris to build up more board presence and fodder for fusions, and load up the grave for Malicious plays. Then once you have all the monsters you can get out onto the field, you want to play Destiny Fusion, Mask Change, etc to go into your large fusions and build the strong board. Note you'll be going first for this. Then you just play the grind game and once your opponent can't do shit, you close them off quickly."

Today I will be sharing an old family recipe for a wonderful Gingerbread deck you can share with your family and loved ones this year.

First we will need to gather some JARS to keep the ingredients fresh so be sure to get anything that can cause you and your opponent to discard and shuffle their hands frequently. That's kind of like hand-washing, which is very important in the kitchen. Also, in order to make sure you have fresh, natural ingredients, make sure to get life points from your local GARDEN.

Then you will need to set the temperature to a nice broil with an assistant like <a data-name=""FIRE PRINCESS"">FIRE PRINCESS</a> or any number of helpful monsters that can get around your opponent's defenses. But make sure to use a MESSENGER OF PEACE so that your opponent doesn't try to eat your gingerbread house before it cools.

I hope that you have as much fun with this recipe as I did making it.

Happy Holidays,
