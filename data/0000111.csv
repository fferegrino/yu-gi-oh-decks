This deck is pretty basic and straight forward. Use <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> to summon <strong>Dark Dragoon</strong> using <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> to utilize <strong>Dark Dragoon's</strong> effect to its fullest.  <strong>Red-Eyes Insight</strong> is great to search out <strong>Red-Eyes Fusion</strong>. <strong>Red-Eyes Wyvern</strong> is great card to send to the graveyard for the coast.  Using <strong>Dragon Shrine</strong> you want to send one of the <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> to the grave then sending <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong> to graveyard. Then use <strong>The Black Stone</strong>'s effect to shuffle <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong> back into the deck and add <strong>The Black Stone</strong> into you hand. <em><strong>Keep in mind</strong></em> the you can <strong><em>only use one</em></strong> of <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong>'s effect per a turn so you'll have to wait for your next turn to use it's other effect.  <strong>The Black Stone of Legend</strong> has a few good targets for it's first effect. <strong>Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</strong>, <strong>Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</strong>, <strong>Red-Eyes Black Dragon</strong>, <strong>Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</strong> or <strong>Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon</strong>.  <strong><em>Gemini Monster Effects</em></strong>- Upon their re-summoning  <strong>Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lighting</strong> is basically crowd control destroying your opponents monster who have less DEF than 2500.  <strong>Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</strong> becomes protection for your Red-Eyes monsters  <strong>Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</strong> inflicts 2400 damage to your opponent at the end of the battle phase as long as damage calculations is done involving Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon.  Use the Virus cards when you are about to lose any card that can't be saved but can be the activation coast for them.  <strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus</strong> will take care of spells and traps that you opponent has in their hand, field or draw for 3 turns.  <strong>Deck Devastation Virus</strong> will take care of low ATK power monsters on the field, hand, and drawn for 3 turns.  <strong>Full Force Virus</strong> will take care of low DEF monsters on the field, hand, and drawn for 3 turns.  Extra Deck Monsters  <strong>Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack </strong>is great to remove pesky cards using his effect by removing tokens that are summoned by removing Xyz materials from the card. Also having immunity while you control a token.  <strong>Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon </strong>is mostly there for a 3000 beat stick that is easy to summon due to the contact fusion ability 1 DARK Dragon-type monster and a Beast-Type Monster thus the reason <strong>Kinka-byo</strong> in the deck.  <strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> is just perfect for a deck that has DARK monsters to spare."

Going first the deck can end on zombie world + Balerdroch with buster lock from a 2 card combo (uni-zombie/ solitaire and any extender.) We play 3 of both necroworld banshee and mezuki because they are our main extender in tandem with uni. Mothman can also be an extender when needed and can help un-clog brick hands. If you have two extenders in addition to solitaire/uni-zombie you can end on I:P+union carrier+ buster locked balerdroch and zombie world. Linkross and formula synchron/ metal marcher provide free advantage from summoning glow up bloom off of needlefiber, make kross with needle then synchro bloom with a token into formula. Draw 1 then make marcher with the last token and formula and bring back bloom. make union carrier with marcher and linkross if you dont have another extender and then link bloom into linkuriboh triggering bloom's eff, summoning out balerdroch then you can use union to equip baler."

Eldlich Dogmatika is my favourite Eldlich Varient. I'd just built it poorly before.,"I decided to give the Dogmatika engine a second go in Eldlich. The first time I hadn't incorporated Dogmatika Punishment, (or Titaniklad) but after thinking about the card a bit I think it is so generic to run, and gets you so much value on its own, that I was thinking of incorporating it into pure Eldlich, but if I was trying the card I wanted to try it with the searchers first.  The Eldlich package is very much my standard set. Sometimes you wish those white eldlixers were black, but generally, I prefer to see white, and you need 2 non reds to search. 2 Solemn Judgement seems essential, especially right after the ban list, with 1 Harpie's Feather Duster a lot of people will have main deck back row sweeping potential, which can result in getting OTK'd if you have no response. Judgement is still the best generic response, and a couple main for that lone Harpie's seems good.  Nadir Servant is the nuts, there's a lot of value here. On the face, you can send Titaniklad to search Ecclesia, which in turn searches you Punishment and Fleurdelis. That's 2 interruptions on 1 card, without a lot of commitment to the main or extra deck. However, it can also send ANY card from the extra deck. We've got 1 main Shaddoll Schism, and 1 Apkallone, meaning Nadir Servant can discard a card to search an extra card. Having the option to discard Golden Lord while getting him Fodder is pretty huge, and so is the ability to discard Golden Land trap monsters to search red Eldlixers. This also gives us access to the Winda combo game 2, but the real purpose game 1 is just to recur the trap a few times and use it to summon Golden Lord, as well as giving the deck a way to discard off of Nadir Servant. Ecclesia is an important tool for getting Nadir Servant's full value - you aren't taking full advantage of its capabilities by using it as a normal summon, but it's good enough of a normal summon to be a 3 of. Fleurdelis sucks, but you need to run 2. Needing a Dogmatika monster on the field is annoying most times you see him naturally, but you need a couple copies - this is a control deck, and being able to search a second copy in the game is really essential. The card is better once you know it is safe to side in Maximus - even with just 1 Maxmius in the deck it feels less like a brick, so this card gets better with Maximus. 2 Punishment seems obligatory, and I might want to try 3 of these with 3 N'tss in random control decks (if they have the space), including ""pure"" Eldlich. 2 pops for 1 is really good, and having other good targets to send makes the card much better. Hand traps should be standard - I don't like Gamma in control decks very much, so it's Ash, Effect Veiler and Impermanence.  The extra deck has a few packages. One is the Dogmatika Send package: 2 Dragon Bastards, 2 Elder Entity N'tss, 1 Skull Knight, plus 1 each of Shaddolls Apkallone, Winda, and Construct. The deck can turbo out Winda game 2 when this is a viable strategy, and can make Construct while popping a Light monster game 1 pretty easily, but mostly these cards are here to send with Dogmatika cards for fun and profit.  The next package is the trains. Choo choo! OTK! I love that Eldlich cards are level 10, because I like trains.  After that is a small link package. Vampire Sucker is good card advantage once you've simplified the game state, and can be made with Eldlich cards. The Knightmares give you some extra removal out of the extra deck. You are locking yourself out of the extra deck a fair amount of the time, but you might as well run a few links for those turns where you can link summon.  In the Side Deck there are 3 Appointer of the Red Lotus and 1 Solemn Judgement. Appointer is very good going first, and can really help in game 2 when the Lightning Storms come in, which is also what Solemn is here for. If you know you're going first game 2 or 3, you should make space for these cards.  2 Maximus is fine, you have 9 searchers and not a lot of space. The card is really pushed, so if you're against a deck that seems really like a heavy combo deck with no space for meta calls to hurt Maximus you can gain insane advantage while disrupting plays a little. Also helps make Winda in matchups where Winda is really good.  3 Forbidden Droplet is great against Combo, especially post-ban. Sure, Infernoble, and like the Water deck, will basically make this card useless, but it is a Dark Ruler No More that can be fired off chained to a lingering effect to negate it, and our deck wants cards in the GY anyways.

Sometimes i dont have the 2 warriors so i use miscellanosaurus to summon aeolus and have halqifibrax and continue the combo but i will prefer to summon borreload savage dragon decreasing phonon pulse dragon to 2 instead of summoning charles as there will not be smoke granade in the graveyard.  you can use the dragun of red eyes path using isolde to summon armageddon knight and sending overtex qoatlus to graveyard and searching double evolution pill, next you link for predaplant verte anaconda and summon ultimate conductor tyrano before using its eff to bring dragun of red eyes.  &nbsp;  the Stardust charge warrior and the tatsunoko are still ways to try but i will replace them with knightmare phoenix and accesscode talker."

You can also use ""Vampire's Curse"" and ""Vampire Grace"" for Rank 6 plays (such as the unorthodox, yet still thematically fitting Number 24: Dragulas the Vampiric Dragon).</span>  <span>""Vampires"" obtained new support revolving around paying Life Points as costs to Special Summon themselves from the Graveyard and search other ""Vampire"" cards and taking control of the opponent's monsters, often by Special Summoning opposing Monsters that were destroyed by battle with a ""Vampire"". This also facilitates the Xyz Summon of ""Damphir Vampire Sheridan"" as it can treat monsters the player controls that are owned by the opponent as Level 6 when used for its Xyz summoning. The Life Point costs can then be recovered with the use of ""Vampire's Domain"".</span>  <span>""Vampire Domain"" allows an additional Normal Summon of a ""Vampire"" monster, this works in tandem with the Link Monster ""Vampire Sucker"", which allows the player to tribute the opponent's Zombie type monsters for the Tribute Summon of a ""Vampire"", it can also special summon a monster from the opponent's Graveyard to their field as a Zombie type so it can be used as tribute.</span>"

Everyone thinks they can't do anything, and it's true that often they rely on the field spell. However, there are multiple strategies and ways to play through various negates as well as just create different boss monsters depending on the situation!  First of all, the monster 3-ofs. You've got a lot here, Pikari is your spell searcher (usually A.I. Land but also A.I.dle Reborn for graveyard recursion and TA.I. Strike for battle phase shenanigans), Balancer Lord allows synergy with Cyberse Wicckid, Parallel eXceed furthers your Link plays, and Achichi serves as a monster searcher. Along with these, Bururu at 2 is needed for Synchro plays but you don't want to see it in your hand (it's not a Garnet by any means, but is more useful in Wicckid combos from the deck). Doyon is run at 2 in order to recycle your @Ignister monsters and spells (very versatile), while Gatchiri is an extender that protects your Link monsters if used as material or just your Cyberse monsters when on the field. Doshin and Hiyari are also one-of extenders that special summon themselves for free, but they can be cut if need be.  Moving on to spells, I run 3 Cynet Mining (needed for any Cyberse deck) as well as 3 A.I. Land with 1 Terraforming (as I said above, really helps your plays). I also run 2 A.I.dle Reborn and 1 Monster Reborn for GY recursion (you could run 3 A.I.dle Reborn, but I feel safer at 2). I also run 2 TA.I. Strike for Battle Phase shenanigans (always fun to kill a Link God Dragon with a Pikari), and 2 Pot of Desires for draw power (you don't have much).  This leaves room for hand traps and other fun spells, I personally run 2 Cosmic Cyclone, 1 Called by the Grave, and 3 Ash Blossom in my main deck, but these can be exchanged with anything that's relevant for the current format.  Your Extra Deck is extremely tight, not because you're limited to a few options, but because you have so many plays that you can pull off. Starting with relatively common combo starters, I run 1 Cyberse Wicckid and 1 Splash Mage. Cyberse Wicckid is very useful with Balancer Lord to add from the deck and then special summon a Bururu from the hand, while Splash Mage is good to go into if you don't have that Balancer Lord in the GY. I also run 2 Linguriboh, because you need easy special summons from the Extra Deck as well as an easy way to free up the main monster zones if needed. 2 Dark Templars are necessary for this deck, being the main combo extender, but after this you can get extremely creative (as long as you use Cyberse Extra Deck monsters).  If you need to safely break a board and OTK, the 1 Accesscode Talker is a very good option. If you need to destroy opponent's monsters while providing protection for your own, summon one of the 2 Light Dragon @Ignisters. If you need to destroy opponent's spells and traps, summon the 1 Wind Pegasus @Ignister. If you wipe the board with Wind Pegasus and Light Dragon, go into the 1 Firewall Dragon Darkfluid with 2 counters to not only negate monster effects if need be but also just OTK. If you just need a Towers, summon the 1 Arrival Cyberse @Ignister. If you need to protect your Links (usually Accesscode), Synchro into Cyberse Quantum Dragon. And finally, if it's turn one or you really need to out an opponent's monster, go into the 1 I:P Masquerena and then the 1 Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax.  The side deck is pretty simple, just fill with whatever hand-traps you have at the time to fight the Meta (my current list is just what I own currently). However, leave 2 spots for Earth Golem @Ignister and A.I. Love Fusion. If your opponent is using a Link-heavy deck like Salamangreats or Sky Striker, simply side this in and watch your opponent's fast as you fusion summon using their own Link monsters. Think Super Polymerization but without the discard.  &nbsp;  And that's @Ignisters! I'll explain the main combo piece that you want to get out with your deck. Normal Summon Balancer Lord, use his effect, and then Normal Summon Pikari. From here, go into Cyberse Wicckid and Special Summon any Ignister or Parallel eXceed from hand, banish Balancer Lord using Wicckid, and then Special Summon the Bururu you add off of Lord. Link into Dark Templar using 3 different named monsters, then special summon any monster to a zone it points to (either turn an eXceed into Linguriboh or special summon another Ignister from hand). From here, you can do pretty much anything you want to go into! This combo runs very similarly if you go into Splash Mage, it really just depends on what cards you're working with. I hope y'all learned something about this new Cyberse powerhouse, good luck Duelists!"

Anti-Meta Stun is the perfect budget choice! Slow the game to a halt by stopping special summoning and b","The philosophy behind Anti-Meta Stun is that most decks nowadays are woefully under-prepared if they cannot special summon, and usually do not have easily accessible outs to spell and traps, unless they draw into it. This deck's goal is to protect and enhance it's anti-special summon monster floodgates with backrow support.  The <strong>equip cards</strong> are to boost our floodgate's lacking attack and to provide situational effects. (Moon Mirror Shield and Mage Power for beating over stronger monsters, Mordschlag to destroy special summoned monsters, Power of the Guardians to provide destruction protection and White Veil for backrow destruction. Armory Call essentially adds 3 more copies of each card in the deck.)  9  <strong>draw cards</strong> to facilitate consistency. This deck's price can be cut substantially by replacing Pot of Extravagance with something else and not including an extra deck.  <strong>Prohibition</strong> is to disallow certain cards to be used crucial to a deck (For example, vs. Eldlich you prohibit Eldlich the Golden Lord). Prohibition can also be called to prevent the use of backrow removal (For example, prohibiting Twin Twisters, Cosmic Cyclone of Harpie's Feather Duster.)  <strong>Counter traps</strong> are to prevent field wipes and destructive backrow cards from being activated such as Lightning Storm, Harpie's Feather Duster and Twin Twister. They are also useful for preventing negation cards like Infinite Impermanence from shutting off the our floodgate monsters for a turn.  This deck <em>excels</em> at going first, as most meta decks cannot play through a hard to destroy special summon floodgate. Most of the time, they are forced to set and pass.  This deck is <em>particularly weak</em> against destruction effects from spell/traps, and may likely suffer versus oppressive boards going second. The 10 traps in the deck can be replaced by handtraps to make it easier to go second."

The Eldlich suite is still the same, 3 of each trap monster to take advantage of the deck's grind game, 3 red and 2 white eldlixer, the red is an important one, but when you're focusing on the grind game you want a second copy to search, 3 of the searcher and Golden Lord, obviously key to the deck's strategy, and 1 of the counter trap, the deck's main omni-negate.  Lost Wind still makes the cut, but Magicians' Souls does not. In this meta, sending your Solemn and Red Lotus is really really bad, given Harpie's Feather Duster is in the meta. The deck runs Extravagance with virtually no cost anyways. The Red Lotus is a meta call, I'm expecting Harpie's to be in a lot of mains for the first little while, and it is a very good check on Eldlich. With Block Dragon gone, Called By The Grave is just a more generically useful way to banish Golden Lord, with a lot of varied applications. I honestly wouldn't run more than 1 anyways, but it's a good one of, to negate an Eldlich while banishing another, or even just stopping Ash. With Called at 1 and Numerons not represented at all, I think it is safe to shift back to Ash from Gamma, especially given this is a going first grind game deck that wants its hand traps to stay live late into the game. Imperm is also obligatory in any backrow deck, and in most main decks. 1 negate is good, the potential second negate is useful, and it is a hand trap that distracts from your other back row.  In the Side Deck there are 3 Waking the Dragons, for game 2 and 3, when the hoard of backrow removal comes in to attack. I don't think you need it in the main deck, given that game 1 most people will only have Harpie's, if that. We also have Harpie's and Red Reboot. Red Reboot is game if you can get your trains going in the mirror, and Harpie's is obligatory. I've also got 3 Cosmic Cyclone, to banish Eldlich trap monsters, which as continuous traps actually negates - also good against Cursed Eldland. Ra is our normal summon. Since we don't have one, we might as well take advantage of Sphere mode to out combo boards. 3 Forbidden Droplet and 1 Dark Ruler No More are also for combo decks - even just getting set up under their monsters, maybe break their board a little, is huge advantage, and Droplet's effect to discard is often upside in the deck. Dark Ruler No More is basically just copy #4.  Added Dogmatika Punishment, with 3 N'tss, for the double pop, over maindeck Appointer of the Red Lotus, a card that is only good going first and only necessary games 2 and 3. I'd considered Compulse, and if you have the Extra Deck space and don't need the extra deck, Punishment is just better."

As per usual, your Main Deck <strong>Shiranuis</strong> are 3 <strong>Spiritmaster</strong>, 3 <strong>Squire</strong>, 3 <strong>Solitaire,</strong> 1<strong> Samurai,</strong> and 2 of both <strong>Spectralsword</strong> and <strong>Spectralsword Shade</strong>. You are of course playing 3 <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> and 3 <strong>Mezuki</strong> for that generic zombie support. You would rather have <strong>Solitaire</strong> or <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> be your Normal Summon with<strong> Squire</strong>, <strong>Spiritmaster</strong>, and <strong>Samurai</strong> be in the grave for you to reborn and use as synchro material.  Your <strong>Shiranuis</strong> also have their banished effects. <strong>Spiritmaster</strong> is removal, <strong>Solitaire</strong> and<strong> Samurai</strong> are for recycling, and <strong>Squire</strong> refreshes your hand and sets up your grave. Your <strong>Spectralswords</strong> do what they do. They use your graveyard as an opportunity to get more advantage through banishing and synchro summoning. They also allow you to get to the <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> synchros without having to use <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> specifically.  Spells and Traps in the main deck are for basic set-up. <strong>Gold Sarc</strong> banishes your <strong>Shiranuis</strong> from deck so that you can get their effects off. <strong>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story</strong> gets you to <strong>Solitaire</strong> which gets you to <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> and it sets up your grave. <strong>Mayakashi's Manuscript</strong> is a better<strong> Shiranui</strong> card than a<strong> Mayakashi</strong> card. It's basically a reborn for any <strong>Shiranui</strong> in your gy or that is banished.<strong> Foolish Burial Goods</strong> has 2 targets:<strong> Shiranui Style Success</strong> and <strong>Return of the Zombies</strong>. <strong>Style Success</strong> is a trap that gets a zombie on field, but it can banish itself from the grave to make a zombie a <strong>Towers</strong> for the turn. <strong>Return of the Zombies</strong> is only a <strong>Foolish Goods</strong> target for now as it can recycle banished zombies and it can get you to your<strong> Shiranui's</strong> banished effects. If you go first, you can use this along with <strong>Zombie World</strong> to be monster removal.  Extra deck has your generic <strong>Shiranui</strong> Extra Deck cards and more possible synchro targets. <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong> is a beater and it takes your opponent's monsters. <strong>Sunsaga</strong> is of course your boss monster. <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> is to get out some damage, <strong>Samuraisaga</strong> is a recycler, and <strong>Squiresaga</strong> is probably the best low level<strong> Shiranui</strong> Synchro. It's good removal in general. <strong>Lavalval Salamander</strong> is a good choice going second since its grave set-up, a way to access your <strong>Shiranui's</strong> banished effects, and it has a <strong>Book of Moon</strong> effect. <strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> since this deck does banish cards. <strong>Archfiend Zombie Skull</strong> to prevent board wipes. And <strong>Revived King Ha Des</strong> since hes a good beatstick (feel free to swap him out for like a different synchro). <strong>Yuki-Onna</strong> since it is an amazing card if you manage to make it. <strong>Skillsaga Supremacy</strong> for more protection. And <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> since this is a Zombie Deck. The link monsters are very limited since there isn't much recursion that they alone provide compared to the synchro monsters in the deck.  Side Deck has <strong>Nibiru</strong> since <strong>Shiranui</strong> doesn't break massive boards. <strong>Neo Flamvell Lady</strong> as a<strong> Uni-Zombie</strong> replacement if you use <strong>Burning Draw</strong> and it's also a pseudo <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.<strong> Burning Draw</strong> to draw 3 or 4 cards usually. <strong>Zombie World</strong> since it is a great floodgate that this deck can manage to play. And <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for more disruption.  &nbsp;"

Imagine a 8k atk monster (at best) with 3 attacks; <strong>Liebe</strong> would be shaking. The<strong> Meklord</strong> part of this deck hits hard while the <strong>Orcust</strong> part is good at controlling the game and protecting your<strong> Meklords.</strong>  Usually, I would talk about the side deck near the end of a breakdown like this, but I'm gonna discuss it now. Side in card according to the environment of your locals or the popular decks your opponents play online. If there are more combo decks, <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> are the better choice instead of <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> or <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. If there are more control decks,<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> and <strong>Cosmic</strong> would be better. <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> is at one in the main deck for the option to go into <strong>Selene Accesscode Talker</strong> combo.<strong> Fallen of Albaz</strong> is a target for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> which sends <strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland. Roland</strong> equips himself to a warrior. <strong>Triskelia</strong> turns into a warrior when made one with<strong> Reprodocus</strong>. Now,<strong> Triskelia</strong> has the opportunity to become at least an 8000 ATK monster with 3 attacks. <strong>Triskelia</strong> gains ATK equal to the combined ATK of the monsters equipped to it.  Look, this deck can fall to <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>. It's a complete glass cannon. Since <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> is limited since the last banlist (to SELL <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>), it's more of a brick in this deck than a form of protection. Full combo is<strong> Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia</strong>,<strong> Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</strong>, and <strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong>. <strong>Obbligato</strong> is a one card <strong>Platinum Gadget</strong> which gets you to <strong>Girsu</strong> and sets up <strong>Triskelia</strong> also. <strong>Plat Gadget</strong> summons <strong>Girsu</strong> to do your<strong> Orcust</strong> combo and it gets your <strong>Galatea</strong> co-linked to prevent it from being run over to turn off<strong> Crescendo</strong> (if you went first). With the amount of <strong>Orcust</strong> extenders you have, your first turn board is decently protected and it provides a feasible amount of protection for you to OTK with <strong>Triskelia</strong>.  <strong>Orcust</strong> engine consists of <strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong>, <strong>Orcust Knightmare</strong>, <strong>Orcust Brass Bombard</strong>, <strong>Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</strong>, <strong>World Legacy - World Wand</strong>,<strong> Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</strong>, <strong>Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator</strong>, <strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong>,<strong> Orcustrated Return</strong>, and <strong>Orcust Crescendo</strong>. <strong>Crescendo</strong> is nice as you can banish it to search a dark machine like <strong>Girsu</strong> or <strong>Triskelia</strong>. <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> can send<strong> Crescendo</strong>.  The <strong>Meklord</strong> part consists of <strong>Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelia</strong>, <strong>Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</strong>, <strong>Meklord Army of Wisel</strong>,<strong> Meklord Army of Skiel</strong>, and <strong>Meklord Assembly</strong>. We aren't playing <strong>Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</strong> since this isn't a pure <strong>Meklord</strong> deck where you are also playing the<strong> Meklord Emperors</strong>.  Spell and Trap lineup get you to your combo pieces quicker. <strong>One for One</strong> might be dead most of the time since you are only playing one <strong>Brass Bombard</strong>, so you could replace it with like <strong>World Legacy - Succession</strong> or <strong>Monster Reborn.</strong>  Extra Deck consists of<strong> Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> and <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> for simple grave set-up.<strong> Reprodocus</strong> and <strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong> for the <strong>Triskelia</strong> meme. <strong>Galatea, Longirsu, Dingirsu,</strong> and<strong> Platinum Gadget</strong> for the<strong> Orcust</strong> stuff. <strong>Gear Gigant</strong> for searching <strong>Girsu</strong> if you have another way to summon him. <strong>Titanikland the Ash Dragon</strong> and <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> as targets for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> and a target for<strong> Fallen of Albaz</strong>.<strong> Accesscode Talker</strong> and <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong> since we are playing <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>.  You can play <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> in this deck, but just take out <strong>Reprodocus, Roland</strong>, and the <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> and <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> along with <strong>N'tss</strong> and <strong>Titaniklad</strong>. We aren't playing <strong>Meklord Army of Granel</strong> since you know, we have better normal summons in this deck."

I dunno what's gotten into me or what has me so attached to these win-pilfering boogers, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  So what's new? Well, I'd say a good bit. For one, Phantom Rage is on its way to grace us with new support for practically any DARK Xyz build (basically my immediate thought when seeing the list was ""Indirect Time Thief support""). For another, Rusty Bardiche is FINALLY playable again after the madness that was early Orcust decks, although it came at the cost of two CBtG's and freedom from Harpie's Feather Duster. And for a final, I'd say along with my new experience and outlook in life in general, so too has mine towards these guys become.  Without further ado, here it is. My latest Time Thief build, with friends new and old to really push them to the next level. Capable of card-snatching, non-targeting bounceback, and a way of using Traps that just really, really tends to get me. We'll go in order of archetypes this time, to really go over each component of the deck and their roles in what we aim to do; pop off with these bad boys by messing with heads and firing back if our foe tries anything nasty. <h2>Time Thieves</h2> These are the handsome devils debuting in Savage Strike the OCG was starved for quite a bit, but then they starved all ten of us players of it back with another key Xyz support monster until Ignition Assault. Fortunately that conflict's come and gone, and now it's time for them to get to work with some fellow DARK monsters of all walks of life. As follows are the Doctor Who, Persona 5, whatever kind of lookalikes you think them to be dorks in full. <ul>  	<li>Who's a good boy? It's <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>, the first of our pilferers and a key one at that. Bringing him out while you have a barren field allows you to Tribute him so he can fetch two of his fellow Time Thieves with different names from the deck. Beware of the looming Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre, and Effect Veiler however, because if any of these come this pooch's way, your heist is bound to end in seconds. But fret not, we run a certain tribe of beasts as a backup plan.</li>  	<li>What's a dog without his trainer? The aforementioned Regulator is best friend to our next main three-of, <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Summoning him in any way will do for his effect well, which adds any Time Thief card other than himself from deck to hand. What you search for may depend on what's already in your hand or GY. Speaking of hands, he can summon himself from the hand just by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, so Xyz Summoning just before bringing him out is a good application as well.</li>  	<li>The Time Thieves are nothing without their technological know-how and doodads, one of which happens to be the <a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a>. More often than not you'll want to try and get it in the GY for when your Xyz monsters hit the field, because it can then revive itself by detaching a material from one of them, though you'll want to use it for an Xyz Summon immediately after as removing it from the field without doing so will banish it. Hence why a summon of an Xyz monster, detaching Bezel Ship with a Winder in hand, then reviving Bezel Ship by detaching the remaining material is A-OK. Alternatively, its on-field effect is great during your opponent's turn, where it Tributes itself to snatch a card from your opponent's GY and attaches it to Time Thief Xyz monster you control. It's much more useful than you think, actually. It's a Quick Effect for one, so it can be chained to pretty much anything, and your opponent can't use what's no longer in their GY. Try it out for yourself and you'll see what I mean!</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li>Though maybe not always as considered, <a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a> can put in some good work like its fellow tools of the trade. When your Xyz monster leaves the field by a card effect (including a certain boss's own), it revives itself from the GY with the same ""don't not use me for another Xyz or I'm history"" syndrome as Bezel Ship, though this one can Tribute itself as a one-time reflection of battle damage your opponent tries to inflict on you for a turn. Its revival effect, however, is definitely at the forefront, and really just goes to show how recursive these guys can be.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The leader at the helm is none other than <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, famous for snatching opponents' cards in the Standby and being very, very hard to kill in the right hands. Depending on what you detach from him (Monster, Spell, or Trap), he'll bounce himself out until the End Phase to dodge attacks and disruptive effects, net you a free draw, or bounce back your opponent's face-up card without even needing to target. Pilot him wisely, as he's about as good as the one who brought him to the field in the first place.</li>  	<li>The main man's lovely assistant is <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>, who does her whole team a lot of favors. In Standby, she detaches a card to revive any Time Thief in the GY, including Redoer! Though if you ask me, you'll likely want to get Bezel Ship back out on your opponent's turn for more snatching and Winder on your turn for more searching if Redoer is already up and running. Other than that, she has a Quick Effect at any time to attach a Time Thief card from deck to any of your Xyz monsters, effectively reloading their resources. I urge you not to sleep on this card, given all it can do.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>We've spoken about Time Thief tools of trade before, but what about backrow? Those are just as important! The first of which is <a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a>. On field it attaches a Time Thief card from deck to your Redoer or Perpetua as material (most often another Flyback), but it can also banish itself from GY to play Bezel Ship's snatching game. That being said, it's not the end of the world if your opponent pops this card, so make them pay by swiping one of their GY resources!</li>  	<li>Speaking of backrow, nobody likes to be on the receiving end of the kind that really, really doesn't want you to play through your setups. But hey, that's why we run <a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a>, which uses Redoer or Perpetua's mere presence to negate a Spell or Trap and attach it to them as material. If it's a Trap that Redoer happens to snatch, you pretty much kill two birds with one stone, since you get to do his bounceback effect immediately after.</li> </ul> <h2>Phantom Knights</h2> Those of you that have seen ARC-V (I sure haven't, one way or another) may remember a certain chap named Yuto who piloted these steely specters. Others may remember their signature Link monster as a splash into another kind of deck that took all its competition by storm some time ago, prior to some of its most important tools getting hit on the banlist. Now that Bardiche has atoned for Orcust's sins, it's time to welcome him back into the limelight with a new set of friends to help accomplish what he sets out to.  A quick note before starting: these DARK Warriors are VERY recursive and easy to make good Extra Deck material out of or search with. It goes without saying that just like all the other Main Deck monsters, they're very thankful to have Armageddon Knight by their side so their GY shenanigans can take place. Though the same goes for their Spells and Traps, some of which banish themselves to revive their users. <ul>  	<li>It goes without saying that <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> is quite the staple to run at three. From the hand, he can summon himself for free provided you control a fellow Knight of his. This includes a monster or backrow unit, but other than that he banishes himself from the GY to search for a ""Phantom Knights"" Spell or Trap, just in case you can't set it just yet using the archetype's Link boss. So try Normal Summoning another PK and then this guy from your hand, I promise it'll be worthwhile.</li>  	<li>Silent Boots' usual partner is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>. He swaps his own position on-field to amp up the ATK and DEF of a DARK monster of your choice by 800, but that's only a drop in the bucket in terms of his utility. You'll mainly be using him to search for a card when banished much like Silent Boots, though instead he looks for any ""The Phantom Knights"" card, including monsters with those words in the title. Just pay very close attention to the word ""The"" and you'll be fine.</li>  	<li>In an interesting twist of fate, a new Main Deck recruit for the shady sword-slingers comes in the form of <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Tear Scale"">The Phantom Knights of Tear Scale</a>, and boy howdy can he be a team player. While he's on the field, he lets you discard any card (including non-PK's with beneficial effects in the GY) to act as a Foolish Burial or Foolish Burial Goods for a Phantom Knights card of your choosing from deck. In the GY, however, he can be even more useful. If any Phantom Knight card whatsoever is banished from there (for its effect or other such things), he revives himself to provide utility for further Extra Deck summons. So essentially, by banishing one of the two main Traps for PK's to revive one of their monsters, you can revive this card as well and make an instant Rank 3. Just be sure to use him for one of those, because he has the same ""banish if it leaves the field"" syndrome as some of the Main Deck Time Thieves tend to.</li>  	<li>One more main deck PK that'll surely extend your plays, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a> is an odd beast, but superbly useful. Should you summon a fellow PK, he summons himself from hand and gives you the option to amp its level up by one. So just by setting up Brigandine, that's an instant double-bouncing Redoer for free! Alternatively, he banishes himself from the GY to summon a PK friend of his from hand for free, also with the option to amp up its level by one. Always helps to have a RotA or Armageddon Knight handy to get this bad boy up and running with his friends.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The main Xyz monster for PK's you'll most often go into is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a>. And I gotta say, for a Rank 3 he puts in some serious work. His effect lets you pop a card on your field (9/10 times himself for his own second effect) and any card of your choosing from your opponent's field. Popping himself may sound silly, but that actually activates his destruction effect that revives any two Phantom Knight monsters from your GY and increases their Levels by 1, letting you go into yet another Xyz Summon but only locks you into bringing out DARK monsters for the rest of the turn. You'll want to run two just in case, because more destruction and revival simultaneously just goes to show all the more recursion these guys have.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Raiders' Knight"">Raiders' Knight</a> is another interesting choice. It looks to be a Break Sword retrain, and it definitely counts as both a PK and Raidraptor, though the latter is pretty much the only mention of them you'll find in the deck. Detaching a card from it lets you Rank-Up or Rank-Down the guy by one into a DARK Xyz of your choosing, so likely either Break Sword or another big bungus DARK Xyz monster rolling about soon.</li>  	<li>But the head honcho of these guys, free from the shackles of Forbidden at last is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>. Words can't describe how important this guy is, only requiring three generic DARK monsters to bring out and essentially acting as a Foolish Burial or Foolish Burial Goods for any of your PK cards a la Tear Scale, while also being able to set one of its backrow directly from the deck. That, and summoning a DARK Xyz monster of any kind to a zone it points to lets you pop any card on the field, so a RUM Quick-Play Spell during your turn is applicable in this regard! I repeat, do not sleep on this monster.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Rounding off the backrow or arms these guys take up is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>. It brings itself out as a Level 4 DARK Warrior, allowing for material of a Rank 4 Xyz of your choosing, but it's worth noting that its effect lets you activate it the turn it's set, provided your GY is free of Traps. Believe me when I say that Time Thief Redoer LOVES being summoned with this card under it, since then it gets its floating and bounceback effects online right out the gate. You'll want to run one because, well, later in the game you'll definitely have a Trap or two in the GY for one reason or another, so it's best to use those extra slots for cards like the next entry.</li>  	<li>That next one being <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>. It's pretty much a tribal Fiendish Chain, targeting a monster of choice to prevent it from having its effects, attacking, or being attacked. But its utility doesn't stop there, since it banishes itself from the GY to revive a Phantom Knight of your choosing. That latter one was a boon that I'd overlooked for the longest time, but now I see the full scope of what this baby does for the deck.</li>  	<li>As far as this next backrow slot, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> and <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a> are practically the same card, equipping to a monster to power it up and offer destruction defense and reviving a PK by banishing themselves from GY. I personally say run whichever of these two you prefer, or both. I just choose to run Sword 'cause, well, I dunno. Guess I'm a big sword doofus or something.</li>  	<li>Another card that PK's are thankful to have unbanned (albeit a couple months or so back) would be <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>. Sure, <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Phantom Knights' Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Phantom Knights' Force</a> is also a thing, but it's moreso for a build of PK and Raidraptor and stuff like that or if you really, REALLY wanna go for Arc Rebellion that badly. But in this case, we'll be running Launch so we can go into a certain stained-glass bungus, or if we're feeling crazy and wanna promote Break Sword into Redoer or Perpetua if we need. It also banishes from GY to attach a PK from hand to an Xyz of your choice, but obviously the promotion takes center stage here.</li> </ul> <h2>Xyz Dragon</h2> Not quite Phantom Knights, not quite Raidraptors, but still very much considered to be key parts of DARK Xyz stuff. Hoo wow, take a shot every time I say ""DARK Xyz"" in this article and your liver will implode. Anyways, when you need a good beatstick or some strong bungus control options, these guys have your back. <ul>  	<li>And it all starts with <a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a>. Pretty much the definition of a beatstick, he detaches both his materials to slurp up half the ATK of an opponent's monster and gives it to himself. Pretty standard stuff, but that's only to enable his Rank-Up into...</li>  	<li>...a guy who's surprisingly lacking a golden heart-shaped arrow, <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>. Aside from looking like he belongs on a goth album cover, provided that he has Dark Rebellion under him as material, he can either slurp up ALL of an opposing monster's ATK for himself, or more often, detach a material as a Quick Effect to negate a monster effect, destroy the one who attempted to use it, and optionally revive an Xyz from the GY. Not only does he only add to PK's recursiveness, but he's the real big reason we tend to run RUM Launch.</li>  	<li>And now for Phantom Rage's very own cover card, though let's hope he doesn't cost too much once he pops up stateside. <a data-name=""Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> provides the best of both worlds from his brothers, and is made all the more easy to go into by Raiders' Knight, which you'll more often than not be using as the sole method or bringing him out. Detaching a material only locks you into attacking with him for the turn, but has it gain the ATK of all other monsters on the field while also negating all their effects (including your own) while it has a DARK Xyz attached to it. And that latter part remains, so really only bring this guy out as a coup de grace to smack your opponent for well, well over lethal.</li> </ul> <h2>Danger!</h2> Hoo boy, remember these guys? The set of creepy-crawly cryptids that certain decks tend to run as a draw engine and way to get bodies for extra summons on the board? Thankfully, you'll be spared from the mass Thunderbird! and Bigfoot! plops in hopes of making Hope Harbinger, as the Danger! monsters here are pretty much for, well, making other Xyz, albeit at lower ranks and maybe also to use as material for Bardiche.  Pretty much every Danger! monster has the primary effect of randomly discarding a card and bringing itself out if it was unhit to draw one, so I'll spare the repetition there and go for the secondary effects in listing each of these out. <ul>  	<li>First of which is <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>. It'll be one of your main means of aiming for a Rank 4, though its discard lets you draw one and then discard one, so if summoning it didn't work out, you can pitch another card of choice from your hand for their own effect.</li>  	<li>Speaking of pitching Danger!s, that's where <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a> comes in. When he hits the GY upon discarding, he revives a Danger! of choice other than himself, though you'll likely be going into Mothman! for more Rank 4's or in the case of the next pick, for Rank 3's.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a> pretty much summons itself regardless of whether or not it's hit with its own effect, since its secondary one brings itself out if discarded. A pretty good pal for all the Main Deck PK's in this regard, since they can make Break Sword and the like.</li>  	<li>The other Level 3 happens to be <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>, which four out of five times you'll want to discard, along with the last Danger! on this list. Main reason being that it summons a Danger! directly from deck, making it all the easier to go into either Mothman! or Tsuchinoko? if you're lacking L3's or 4's to build stuff out of.</li>  	<li>And last but not least, the searcher comes in the form of <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>. This final must-discard searches any Danger! monster of choice, so more often than not you'll want to empty your hand of all but this, activate its effect to search for Jackalope?, then use that guy to bring out a L4 or 3 right away. Pretty easy stuff, right?</li> </ul> <h2>Other Main Deck Staples</h2> The next four cards really don't belong to a set archetype, but have totally earned their places here one way or another. <ul>  	<li>After all, what would a DARK-based deck be without <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>? Searchable with RotA and a simple summon Foolish Burial's a DARK monster of choice. That, and he's a L4, so you can go into Redoer or any of your staple R4's with ease.</li>  	<li>Speaking of, <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>! Just as any DARK deck has a mandatory Armageddon, any Warrior deck lacks completion if it lacks this card. And this Spell gives you the choice of Armageddon himself or any of your PK's.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is, well, what Armageddon, Tear Scale, and Rusty Bardiche tend to be minus the tribalism or xenophobia. Any monster in your deck can step right up to be sent to the GY this way, including the next spot here.</li>  	<li>A bird in a set of knights, armor and machines? Outsiders to how DARK Xyz decks run may scratch their heads at the sight of <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a> here, but he's got a pretty decent niche. At the cost of 400 LP, he bounces a face-up card of yours back to your hand to revive himself for a very, very odd ""once-per-Duel"" thingie. Something crazy I've been able to do a couple times is bring out a Danger! with its own effect, bounce it back to my hand with Zephyros, and use the Danger!'s effect in hand AGAIN for another free summon and draw. You likely won't get to do that often, but it feels oddly satisfying when it does.</li>  	<li>Other than that, though, feel free to swap out any Main Deck card you'd prefer as something else for anything in the Side Deck. <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for generic revival, <a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> to get another Time Thief out of your hand for free, all that good stuff.</li> </ul> <h2>Extra Deck Staples</h2> Let's not forget about all the other Extra Deck stuff, though! Time Thieves and PK's fill their roles well here, but what about all the others? <ul>  	<li>Like, say, <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>! It's a walking Mystical Space Typhoon once a turn, popping a backrow by detaching a material. Your Time Thief cards can make this thing easily, as can your Danger!s. But there's another generic Rank 4 that can do that job as well.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> may not see too much play nowadays, but can be pretty situational by shutting off your opponent's ability to use GY cards for the whole turn, during ANY phase of ANY turn. You won't bring it out too often, but when it does its job, it can really pay off.</li>  	<li>Upset that your banished PK's can't be of use anymore? Well, that's no longer the case with the little ditty known as <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a>! A generic Rank 3, detaching a card from him lets you bring back any banished Level 3 or 4 monster of your choice. PK gone? No problem! Bezel Ship, Regulator, or Chronocorder down for the count in the same way? That too's a thing of the past! See what I mean by incredible recursion?</li>  	<li>Speaking of generic Rank 3's, <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> makes his appearance, though it's not likely you'll be bringing him to the field outside of general milling or just to get some extra ATK to go for lethal or something.</li>  	<li>With all these Level 3's running around, what would this deck be without <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>? It is just about the only other one of its kind here, aside from Dante, and he's got a much more useful effect. Any monster he points to can't be axed off by card effects, and he can protect himself by letting you send another card you control to the GY instead. Not only that, but he also acts as a Foolish Burial for any Level 3 of your choosing to power himself up (though the first half of that is what you're aiming for) and a way to get two Level 3's into the GY from field so their effects can take place. Boy, am I thankful this guy got reprinted in the 2020 Tin of Lost Memories. Among all the Extra Deck tech reprints and the questionable addition of yet more support for DM's two vanilla lovechildren, I'll try and look out for this guy solely. Well, him and the next card.</li>  	<li>A machine, in a group of master criminals and ghostly warriors? Yeah, a big boss in many Xyz decks and something that can be situational yet very worthwhile here is <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>. Requiring 3 Xyz monsters of any kind, any attempt for your opponent to walk over this guy or bash it with monster effects from anything besides an Xyz monster is futile. Not only that, but his activated effect revives an Xyz of choice from your GY, then attaches any card your opponent has to it as material. Imagine the shock on their face when you revive Redoer with this guy, attach your opponent's Trap to it, and then use Redoer to</li>  	<li>Don't let all these Extra Deck placements stop you from using other cards, however. <a data-name=""Bujinki Ahashima"">Bujinki Ahashima</a>, for example, is pretty much a lite version of Rusty Bardiche that can revive two cards of the same level to immediately use for an Xyz, and <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> can be your emergency button if you're lacking in options against your opponent's main tools, and any Link monster of yours is safe from it and free to pop off to pick off those threats.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  So that's the deck as a whole. But before I close, just wanna give you some good tips to help play to the best of your ability. <h2>Handy Notes for Play</h2> <ul>  	<li>With Regulator, you'll want to go into Winder and Chronocorder typically, though if Winder's in your hand change it to Chronocorder and Bezel Ship. When you summon Redoer using these two, use Winder to detach a material to summon itself, then Redoer's effect to detach the remaining monster on it and bounce out. That way, Chronocorder will revive itself and you can then use it and Winder to go into another Rank 4, like Perpetua or Tornado Dragon. If you can get another Level 4 body on the field, you can then revive Bezel Ship from the GY by detaching a material from that other Rank 4, then use it and the other L4 for another Rank 4. So it's definitely possible to get three Rank 4's up turn one, and then use Perpetua during your opponent's turn to revive Bezel Ship from GY so it can use its Quick Effect snatch.</li>  	<li>Redoer can be a Swiss army knife, with the way he lets you draw, bounce back, and avoid disruptive effects. Just know where and when to proc them, like if Redoer himself is being targeted for a disruption or if your opponent's about to bring a big mean boss to the field that'll spell danger for you if you don't detach a Trap right there. That being said, if you're going to proc his effect to bounce himself out and dodge stuff, make sure to also detach Spells and Traps on him at the same time to get the most out of his momentary exit. Just watch out for Ash's, Ghost Ogres, or things of the sort that can stop him dead in his tracks.</li>  	<li>It's not the end of the world if Phantom Knight cards end up in the GY before you want them to. That's where stuff like Tear Scale and Rusty Bardiche come in. These two could send Fog Blade or Sword/Wing that way to then banish themselves to revive the PK's you desire. Bonus points if Tear Scale is in the GY with them, since it revives itself in the process without necessarily needing either of those Traps to do so.</li>  	<li>RUM Launch is primarily for Ranking-Up Dark Rebellion into Dark Requiem, but don't forget that you can use Break Sword on the field to make Redoer or Perpetua in a pinch when you need, including reviving Break Sword during your opponent's turn with Fog Blade or Sword/Wing.</li>  	<li>Perpetua puts in quite a bit of work as well. Don't take for granted the fact that she can attach any Time Thief card from deck to any Xyz monster you control to reload their resources. Putting another Flyback or Retrograde on Redoer's just as important, but don't forget to keep Dark Requiem and Tornado Dragon going strong in the same way, too!</li>  	<li>Again, only use Arc Rebellion as a game-ender, because after you get off his effect, there's not really any going back seeing as how everything on the field, including your own stuff, has essentially been Skill Drain-ed and your opponent may or may not have a nasty backrow card pop up during battle that would put every hole in your plan possible. Sure, it's a great closer, but not without its risks. And you don't have to rely solely on it as a wincon, either.</li> </ul> All in all, Time Thieves and Phantom Knights are a fun deck with cool nonlinear combo lines and methods of snagging a win, in my personal opinion. It might not shatter things like Adamancipator, Dogmatika, or any of the umpteen Eldlich builds as quick as a snap anytime soon, but I like to think that it can hold its own and shatter expectations in the right hands and mindset. If I were to cap the strategy as a whole off, I'll say that experience is the best teacher when it comes to this deck, so feel free to give it a whirl for yourself and see just how many heads you can make spin with these DARK doofuses. Either that, or splash Dogmatika in place of certain things if you're feeling crazy or just one of <strong>those</strong> people. Regardless, I hope you have fun the way I did learning and optimizing this deck over the past several months or so.  Thanks for giving my decklist a read, as well as my other ones! I honestly wasn't expecting my last Time Thief/Phantom Knight build to reach the amount of clicks it got or wind up as the top Google result for ""time thief phantom knight"" if I'm reading it right. Don't mean to toot my own horn, but I'm glad I got as far with these guys as I did. Maybe they'll reach meta relevancy, maybe not. But either way, you won't see me quitting on them anytime soon."

Feather Duster itself is situational, but the combos in this deck can shut down any deck. Feather Storm is the best card in this deck, able to completely shut down hand traps and opponent's big boards in one card. Going first is always optimal. The board is made the moment you're able to get any 4 harpies on the board. Then you go into this combo for Infinite Negates: Link 2 into Romulus Search and Equip Lance Equip and Summon Phalanx Link Harpie and Phalanx into Union Carrier Link Romulus and Final Harpie into Simorgh Equip Simorgh with Thunderbird via Carrier Summon Avian in End phase via Simorgh  If you go 2nd, then you want to make a board aiming for Aggressive plays dependent on opponents board: Heavy Backrow: Search for Hunting Grounds and start popping backrow. Dragun: Bait out negate from Dragun then drop feather storm from hand with normal summoned harpie. Then go into Zerofyne to wipe effects Golden Lord/Infernobles: Use Cyber Slash to bounce to hand/Extra Deck rather than send to GY."

It's somewhat synchro based, but the fusion aspect of Amazoness is still there. I tried to keep overly expensive cards out of the deck, but couldn't get it as cheap as I would have originally liked. Some of the cards are pretty expensive; mainly the Knightmare Links, Red-Eyes Darkness Dragoon, the Predaplant link, and Crystron Halqifibrax. The deck will cost around 200 dollars USD, but that's mainly due to the engines. Garden Rose Maiden is a nice side deck option but is not necessary especially when considering her price."

(to get into your other draitrons)                                                                                  Activate nova and summon alpha from the deck, then link off alpha into linkuriboh                                                  Activate cyber emergency, search for zeta, then activate alphas effect pitching zeta and searching for cyber angel benten.                                                                                                                                                                          Now you have a level 1 on the field, you can activate where arf thou and search for delta                                          Activate Zeta and send delta to search for your ritual spell                                                                                                Then activate gamma and send benten, special summon delta using gammas eff and search for diviner of the herald off of benten's eff  Moving on to the second part of the combo:  Normal summon diviner of the heralds and send herald of the arc light to the GY, then search for the ritual you want to summon (normally DRA)                                                                                                                             Link off linkuriboh and diviner of the heralds to summon halqifibrax, which goes into PSY-gamma (DON'T ACTIVATE FAFNIR IN RESPONSE TO PSY-GAMMAS SUMMON IT'LL STOP THE COMBO)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Use PSY-gamma and delta to summon metalmarcher, and resummon gamma                                                            Now use halqifibrax, PSY-gamma, metalmarcher and one of your draitrons to summmon 4 neg apollousa  (the normal combo doesnt go into delta i was just very lucky so you would go into 3 neg apollousa and spare the other draitron)                                                                                                                                                                              Activate delta's eff in the GY to send DRA and summon itself, you can then reveal your ritual spell and draw 1   Now you can activate your ritual spell and summon DRA from the GY using gamma and alpha                               Recur your ritual spell by lowering the attack of zeta then resummon linkuriboh.  &nbsp;  ===Follow-Up Plays===  In your next turns you can load up your graveyard with more ritual monsters to easily summon using the engine you've developed, these plays can do a lot of different things depending on what the board state is like  By summoning alpha from the grave using its eff and sending your summoned ritual monster (or rituals or draitrons you've used for turn) you can search for a ritual monster (take your pick). You can send that searched ritual to grave to summon gamma which can resummon another one of your draitrons. then you can use your ritual spell to go into any of your rituals and if you need to you can recur it the same turn and summon two rituals (although this normally requires you to draw into a draitron for turn). Rinse and repeat to keep building up your board.  Additionally during your follow-up turns or your first turn if you can't go into standard combo, you can go through your invoked plays for extra bodies and mechaba interuption.  ===Invoked combo===  The invoked combo is fairly simple, normal summon aleister to search invocation, link off aleister into almiraj and then into secure gardna. Use aleister and secure gardna to summon mechaba then recycle aleister for next turn. Then next turn you can use almiraj in the GY to summon purgatrio or if mechaba was outed you can use mechaba in GY to summon another one.  &nbsp;  ===Other Plays===  By searching and sending Cyber angel natasha during your follow-up plays (or first turn if you draw into it) you can banish your benten from the grave to summon natasha and take control of one of your opponents monsters, then natasha can give you some free life points (always nice to have especially if you used where arf thou)  If you have sauravis you can ritual summon it off of 2 draitrons (one with 1000 less ATK from recurring meteornis) which so you can negate one of your opponents special summons by bouncing sauravis to your hand, by discarding sauravis you can negate an effect from your opponent which targets. (sauravis is normally going to be sided out because its quite situational but if you want to take it out the main deck completely feel free to do so, i haven't had a change to evaluate it much)  If your opponent manages to deal with your board, and you can get out 2 of your draitron monsters, you can easily go into Negalogia AA Zeus via Lyrilusc to wipe the board and get a big beater on the board  I've also thrown in Masquerena and unicorn for some extra interruption as well as borrelsword if thats your thing.  ===Side Deck===  The side deck in this decklist is more for other plays and mini combos you can run (you could even side the 6 card invoked engine instead of maining it)  The Nekroz monsters provide powerful going first and second effects which are great at dealing with your opponent. (I havent really played much nekroz so there may be other cards that would work in the deck better than these ones)  If you want to you can run waking the dragon to summon out powerful extra deck monsters without much effort (doesn't really work here because i don't run any traps so just swap it out for generic side deck cards if you want to)  &nbsp;  ===Other Notes===  I don't play linkross or the V.F.D synchro package because i don't personally like them and i find them to be very O.P and quite toxic, but thats just me.                                                                                                                           I didn't run dragoon cuz my friends bully me for always playing it.  &nbsp;  ===Updated=== <ul>  	<li>Added Invoked Augoeides for more options with the invoked engine</li>  	<li>Fixed the startegy guide so its readable</li>  	<li>Increased the size of the Draitron Package for better Consistency</li> </ul> &nbsp;  If you've read this your probably intrigued by this deck so please give it a like and share it so i have something to brag about i guess"

With Infinity, Sieger and the Borel Dragons you have some back role, if you can't finish the game in one turn. Power Bond doubles the ATK of the summoned monster but inflict damage to you based on the original ATK by the summoned monster. In the best case you summon Cyber Twin Dragon with it. It has 5600 ATK with two attacks. Sieger helps you surviving by it's effect. Infinity is a very good interupt and it's effect is once per copy, so you can use multiple Infinitys. I added Yata to the decklist. The reason is very simple. If you normal summon ""Cyber Dragon Core"" to use it's effekt, you can't use the effect of e.g. ""Cyber Dragon Drei"". Also it's just lv 2. Yata allows you to tribute Core and specail summon Yata instead. Yata is Lv 5 and a good way to go for Infinity, if necessary. Cyber Load Fusion and Cybernetic Overflow has a very good synergy. You have some hand traps to stop your opponent making plays and Called by the Grave to avoid hand traps. The combopotential is very hughe so you should take some time and test around. But always remember: This decks wants to kill your oponent in the first turn you can attack."

They piqued my interest during the ""Create-a-card"" contest Konami is still holding at the time of writing this. The archetype, unfortunately, did not manage to get out of the first round, but it certainly sparked some interest in people. ""Hazy Flame"" is an archetype that consists entirely of Level 6 Fire monster with their unique shared effect being that they all cannot be targeted by the opposing card effects. The goal is to summon multiple of those Level 6 monsters to summon various Rank 6 Xyz monsters and win the game using the effects of your assembled Extra Deck force.</p><p>The combination of needing both Level 6 and the Fire Attribute is fairly restrictive, meaning that you will have to stay in the archetype to gain access the Extra Deck. But thankfully, there are some options to work with on that end. ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"" is your main playstarter and can be Normal summoned via ""<a data-name=""Hazy Pillar"">Hazy Pillar</a>"" without tribute, who can Special summon two ""Hazy Flames"" by tributing itself and discarding another Fire monster. This allows you to search for any combination of ""Hazy Flame"" monsters, but an especially useful combo is picking double ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"", which locks you into summoning Fire monsters but not only can be used to summon the very powerful ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"", but also give whatever monster you Xyz summon using them additional Xyz materials from the graveyard (which you already setup via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"").</p><p>""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Griffin"">Hazy Flame Griffin</a>"" can be Special summoned from the hand if your opponent controls a monster and if everything in your graveyard and on your board is Fire Attribute, but can also be cheated out via ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"" has a handy effect to Normal summon itself without tribute and is your main searcher in the deck who is triggered by being destroyed; something that both ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Goka, the Pyre of Malice"">Goka, the Pyre of Malice</a>"" happily do for it. ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" can even destroy it in hand and therefore allows you to access the first combo I named without losing the Normal Summon slot to ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Sphynx"">Hazy Flame Sphynx</a>"" has no summon help itself, but can potentially fetch a monster by guessing the top card of your deck correctly (since the deck is mostly monsters, I would suggest guessing that most of the time).</p><p>Further summoning options in the deck are ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", since ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Cerbereus"">Hazy Flame Cerbereus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hyppogrif"">Hazy Flame Hyppogrif</a>"" have 200 DEF. This is also the only reason why ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hyppogrif"">Hazy Flame Hyppogrif</a>"" is in the deck at one copy. ""<a data-name=""Fire King Arvata"">Fire King Arvata</a>"" is the searchable card for ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and provides effect negation in addition to being a more summonable monster if you cannot access anything else. ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" might seem weird, but it can trade itself against ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" with relative ease while also potentially refueling ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit"">Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit</a>"" is not a Fire monster, but can Special summon itself if the opponent controls a monster and also fetches the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Tyhone #2"">Tyhone #2</a>"" when being used as tribute, which together with ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Peryton"">Hazy Flame Peryton</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" could summon your boss monster at maximum power with five materials.</p><p>The backrow was mostly mentioned already: ""<a data-name=""Fire King Island"">Fire King Island</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Hazy Pillar"">Hazy Pillar</a>"" are there for consistency reasons, while ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" not only has the task of providing Xyz material but also could accrue a full board of ~2000 ATK monster, which can be used for a surprising beatdown strategy. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" searches for ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" (albeit this way of accessing ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" will cost quite a few hand cards), ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is the usual graveyard summoning tool while ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" allows for graveyard setup. The two ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of Convocation"">Hieratic Seal of Convocation</a>"" allow for the search of ""<a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit"">Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit</a>"" and further boost the otherwise weak consistency and ""<a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a>"" can add copies of ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" or other monsters you potentially do not need in the hand to the deck and refreshes your hand.</p><p>Since I already mentioned the boss monster: ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Basiltrice"">Hazy Flame Basiltrice</a>"" was (and still is) the main goal to summon in ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame"">Hazy Flame</a>"". This fiery chicken has sizeable stats, a banish effect and added protection at five materials, but sadly dies rather easily to ""Kaijus"". Other than that, the Extra Deck is filled with a variety of options to go into in certain situations: ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a>"" supports the beatdown strategy by lowering the opposing monster line-up to zero attack, ""<a data-name=""Constellar Ptolemy M7"">Constellar Ptolemy M7</a>"" bounces monsters you can not destroy, ""<a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>"" is a potential turn one play which can block opposing monster effects, ""<a data-name=""Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis"">Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis</a>"" is just a beatstick, ""<a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" on legs and therefore steals opposing monsters/defenses and ""<a data-name=""Fairy Knight Ingunar"">Fairy Knight Ingunar</a>"" bounces the entire field except himself. ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" was already mentioned, but it is probably the best control option you can get on the field turn one and, since you normally use ""<a data-name=""Hazy Flame Hydra"">Hazy Flame Hydra</a>"" to summon it, will have four materials attached to it instead of the usual two. The Link options mostly stay untouched, but ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"" can be useful for the aforementioned ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" beatdown while they all serve as easy options to go into if you do not have any better options to go into with the ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" resources (since those monsters are banished at the end of the turn).</p><p>So much for the strategy. I have to add that ""Hazy Flame"" is pretty bricky due to the usage of Level 6 monsters and being without any good Attribute support cards to boost their consistency (since Fire does not provide much helpful generic support). The deck can be stopped with relative ease if the opponent can throw a negate into your plays and there will be times in which your starting hand does not provide any playable solutions at all. Also, the archetype has problems with doing anything other than putting some Xyz monsters on the field (not unlike the ""Battleguards"", which do essentially the same but with Rank 5 Xyz).

This is achieved through control with hand traps and, hate to say this, Mystic Mine  Sky striker cards are exceptional when going second through popping your opponents monsters and backrow with afterburners, and negating and stealing your opponents monsters.  Hand trap lineup is extremely flexible although I effect veilers are mandatory as a 2-of at least.  Book of Moon is there to provide some first turn plays by shutting off your opponents synchro and link plays, and forcing out negations and reactions going second.  Instead of Triple Tactics Talent you can easily play with either 3 Pot of desires or (my favorite) 1 Averice and 2 desires. Arguably it could be better to ditch TTT since it hardly does anything for Sky Strikers going first.  Forbidden droplet can be switched for Dark Ruler No More or Evenly Matched depending on the meta at your locals or regionals.  &nbsp;"

Plaguespreader Zombie forcing you to put a card back on top of the deck is much worse than discarding, especially in Edlich, and you have to run a lot more bricks. It also doesn't leave a lot of room to play around with, you're basically just running Eldlich cards and a zombie synchro combo with hand traps. On the other hand, you only have to run 1 of each brick, since Zombie lets you put them back into your deck, and Uni-Zombie is an incredible starter option in Eldlich, since it can discard Eldlich cards for free while sending Plaguespread, and vice versa.  Sorry combo doesn't work, took out the one that did. Wish you could take these down.  &nbsp;"

First start is mainly about getting mechaba and an ecclesia out so you can start searching dogs while still having a negate. Ideally want to get shaddoll schism first turn so you can go into winda on your opponents turn. If your board is still intact after the second turn it is pretty easy to go into invoker of madness or BLS. Plenty of hand traps for going second. I like playing three knighted because you can actually throw it out there on your opponents first turn so if you have another in your hand you already have a negate set up or it sets your field to go into invoker of maddness next turn by linking something into almiraj. Anyway, any feedback would be much appreciated, and thanks for taking a look!  &nbsp;  Also looking for advice on side deck options if you cannot tell!"

But so long as Needlefibre exists, degeneracy is possible.","So, Block Dragon is gone, and so is O-Lion. What is Adamancipator to do to get onto the board?  Here comes what will certainly be this format's darling for combo players, Karakuri Shogun.  The deck certainly doesn't have Block Dragon anymore. But now instead of your basic Halq combo ending on Raptite + a couple of monsters, it can end on Raptite + Savage/Dragite. The huuuuge downside is that this combo uses up all of your zones, so ideally a Linkross combo will be discovered to replace this, but in the meantime it gives you a chance to actually get on the board with Adamans, without getting lucky on your hits. The other big downside is no Apollousa for you, since Auroradon locks you out of Links, so in all probability, this is just a stop-gap. Having said that, the deck wasn't hit quite as hard as I thought it was.  I lied, you do have exactly 1 monster slot open for Koa'ki Meiru Guardian. That's awesome."

Instead of making a level 5 ressing an Infernoble monster, I'm opting to make Cryston Quandax. However, rather than just enabling a path to True King of All Calamities, I've made the board Savage + Crocodragon + Charles, with Savage + Charles as reasonably anti-nibiru combo when you have access to Gearfried, by summoning the Plaguespreader off of Halqifibrax, and using Cryston Quandax + a level 4 to make Power Tool Dragon to ressurect it.  For those unfamiliar with the deck, Infernoble is a combo deck, which has a gameplan largely resolving around using Infernoble Emperor Charles in combination with Smoke Grenade of the Thief to be a big boss monster (with potentially good protection) that pulls cards out of your hand, and protects this with negates. These are generally Isolde turbo decks, that aim to take advantage of all the good combo cards available in the format. This particular version can turn 1 Isolde into True King of All Calamities + a Borreload Savage Dragon (Or Crocodragon + Charles, useful when you pick back up Smoke Grenade to loop hands a second time).  Combo #1 - Bread and Butter  1 - Summon Isolde, add a card to the hand  2 - Isolde effect, send 4 (including Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade), summon Armageddon Knight, send Plaguespreader Zombie  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Put 1 card from your hand on top of your deck - summon Plaguespreader Zombie (don't use Phoenix Blade)  5 - Synchro Zombie + 1 token into Martial Metalmarcher. Since zombie is banished it summons nothing. This feels bad, but making Power Tool a tuner is important.  6 - Synchro Metalmarcher + Arma Knight into Power Tool Dragon, add D.D.R to your hand  7 - Link Power Tool + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Deskbot 001  8 - Link Deskbot + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens, summon Deskbot from the GY  9 - Synchro Deskbot + the level 1 token + 1 level 3 token into Roland  10 - Auroradon effect, tribute the 2 tokens, summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, Coltwing effect summon 2 tokens, Deskbot effect summons itself from GY  11 - Synchro Deskbot + 1 token into Herald of the Arc Light  12 - Because of its effect, Coltwing will be a level 7 monster. You can use Phoenix Blade's effect to add itself to your hand, then discard it for D.D.R. which summons Plaguespreader Zombie.  13 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + Coltwing into Charles  14 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage.  This is the combo that you're going to end on a lot of the time, and is the go-to when you know it is safe. It puts the most # of negates on the board, and takes the slightest toll on your hand. It uses up all of your zones, so when you see Gearfried, go for an anti-nibiru combo.  Combo #2 - True King + Negate (or Hand Snipe)  1 - Summon Isolde, add a card to the hand  2 - Isolde effect, send 3 (including Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade), summon Crusadia Arboria  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Linkross + Arboria into Crystron Halqifibrax, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  5 - Synchro Zombie + token into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Arboria  6 - Synchro Arboria + token into Crystron Quandax  7 - You CAN use the Quandax to link into Auroradon, leaving Metalmarcher on the field, and there are combos in the deck that do that, but for this combo, Link Metalmarcher + Needlefibre into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Quandax + token into Power Tool Dragon, add D.D.R to the hand  9 - Auroradon effect, tribute 2 tokens, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens  10 - Put on card from you hand into your deck, summon Plaguespreader Zombie (Do no use the Sword!)  11 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + Power Tool Dragon into Charles  12 - Use Phoenix Blade's effect, add it to the hand  13 - Activate D.D.R., discard Phoenix Blade, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  14 - Synchro Plaguespreader + Token into Roland  15 - Summon Plaguespreader Zombie with its effect (you can use Phoenix Blade this time, but you aren't guaranteed the monsters, and often Infernoble monsters are more valuable in the GY)  16 - Since Coltwings effect makes it a level 7, synchro into Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys (you pick back up what you put in your deck)  17 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage  This combo is good for when you know you're going up against a monster mash deck. Adamancipator is the best example of this, but against a lot of decks a True King is just G.G. The other time you'll use this combo is to snipe hands with Crocodragon, for when you see a Smoke Grenade naturally, or can pick one up with Renaud. Here we see the weaknessess and strengths of Plaguespreader Zombie in full effect - it isn't once per turn, but putting cards into the deck is not fun. But if you're feeling the card disadvantage, and you have Smoke Grenade of the Thief in your hand, this is a targeted way to snipe an extra card from their hand, or an extra disruption on their turn. The negate is generally more valuable than this, but it could vary, especially if you snipe hands early and see multiple outs, or think Calamities is good in the matchup. (he has to be more valuable than Charles + an interaction, or the equivalent of 3 interruptions, which is hard)  But what if you want to play Gearfried? Let's face it, Infernoble has many strengths, and Gearfried is one of them. Well, you can start combos with Gearfried pretty easily, any time you see it alongside an equip, or see the right Infernoble cards together, especially since we're running Ingnoble Knight of High Laundsallyn to secure that Renaud + Ogier play. When you do see Gearfried, summon him as normal, and go through the following combo.  Combo #3 - Anti-Nibiru Savage + Charles  1 - Isolde, search a card  2 - Isolde effect, send 4 for Oliver (by now you should realize how important Phoenix Blade and Smoke Grenade are)  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Plaguespreader Zombie  5 - Synchro Plaguespreader Zombie + token into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Oliver  6 - Synchro Oliver + token into Roland (effect)  7 - Link Metalmarcher + Needlefibre into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Oliver + token into Borreload Savage Dragon  9 - Summon Plaguespreader Zombie with its effect, putting a card from your hand into your deck  10 - Tribute Auroradon + token into Coltwing (since you put a card into your deck before this, it could be coltwing). Its effect doesn't activate.  11 - Coltwing is a level 7, so badabing, badaboom, you have Oliver.  12 - You just have an extra token here, so you can make Herald if you have an unused Oliver or Renaud in your hand.  This combo changes by the hour. I've figured out a way to get to Charles + Savage that puts up an extra token, and uses Coltwing, so 1 fewer brick. This combo also goes through Oliver, so better protection on Charles.  I've added in the Tatsunoko and Omega to the main deck, by cutting Ignoble Knight and Isolde. Ignoble Knight is only good for anti-Nibiru combos in this deck, and only for some of them, so I'm fine cutting it, and the back-up Isolde isn't really as good turn 2, or useful if they negate Isolde's second effect. I hate losing Ignoble Knight, but I like having even more hand-looping potential. I've added a second Living Fossil so that we can add a second copy after sending a copy, in case we Monster Reborn or somehow D.D.R a Power Tool Dragon.  Cut the Calamities combo to put back in Ignoble Knight, for more Gearfried starts, as well as Instant Fusion with Invoked Raidjin as an extender. I kept the tutorial in, in case somebody wanted to run the combo. I almost never made Calamities that way anyways, and having extra extenders helps the deck play through interactions. I'm liking 2 Aqua Dolphin, 2 Living Fossil. Aqua Dolphin is a very good normal summon in the deck in its own right, and Living Fossil is a good extender. D.D.R. is similarly not a brick, and can actually extend you through hand traps.  There's definitely some play to these combos. I've found Power Tool is not always necessary to make your ultimate board, but I do like the consistency boost and combo potential it and D.D.R add to the deck.  I'm up to 2 Power Tool Dragon now. Pak is right, it's useful for comboing off through bricks, or for extending combos further. I replaced Instant Fusion with E-Teleport. While this forces you to go through Needlefibre (I'd always rather start with Isolde+Linkross) it also extends into Needlefibre, and even just the Needlefibre combo is pretty sweet. With good play and correct extenders, you can make some pretty insane boards through interruptions while hand looping for multiple cards."
