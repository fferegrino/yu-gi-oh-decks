I won't talk much about the old tearlaments cards so we will jump straight to the Kashtria in the decks...<br /><br /><strong>Kashtria Part</strong><br />1. Kashtria Unicorn - a good starter to hammer the extra deck and a primary searcher for the Kashtira Papiyas<br />2. Kashtria Fenrir - by default he was meant for utility but now SERVES a bigger purpose, he will help you search any of the Kashtria monsters in the deck (aim for Kashtria Tearlaments for fusion start or aim for Riseheart for XYZ start)<br />3. Tearlaments Kashtria - her name alone is treated as a Tearlaments card, with that Chaetcaros can search for her, Reinoheart can dump her, Kaleidoheart also can do the same. She's the new starter for Tearlaments and easiest to summon due to banish either 1 Kashtria card or Tearlaments cards then select whose top 3 of the deck to mill and should she be sent to GY, she'll mill another 2 on top of yours<br />4. Kashtria Riseheart - Alright this guy alone is a double edged sword on so many levels in this deck, should you activate his effect first, you can no longer fusion that turn but if you sequence it correctly, you can use him + any Kashtria to make Shangrila which is HARD to be destroyed and will acts as a starter to bring out Arisheart<br />5. Prime Planet Paraisos - without a doubt this card is Kashtria version of Ruined Realm Perleino BUT for every different attribute u gain 100 atk and IT'S NOT BOUND to your side of the field but BOTH you and your opponent. With Shangrila on the field expect to destroy 1 card each time you banish a card. You can use it to search any kashtria to start the madness<br />6. Kashtira Papiyas - this magic spell is a recycler for your Kashtria cards that is banished by Ariseheart. Not only it serves as a free summon of a different attribute, it acts as a permanent material for ariseheart effect spam</p><p>7. Kashtria Shangri-la - This is not the boss but just an Ant Queen, pouring her army to the field at every standby phase both you and your opponent. The biggest catch is it's indestructability as long as it has a material or as long as its effect is not negated.<br />8. Kashtria Ariseheart - by the time this guy is out, the whole field is swarmed with both tearlaments and Kashtria monsters, nothing goes to the GY anymore, it's just instant banish after banish with Shangri-la locking parts of the field for every banish once per turn</p><p><strong>Tearlaments</strong><br />1. Tearlaments Perlegia - This will act as a permanent fusion plant for you as long as you can cycle 1 Aqua monster to the GY each time by the effect of your own Tearlaments or opponents card effects</p><p>Based on playtesting, you can takeout Winda &amp; Shadoll Beast and replace them with another Shangri-la or Lulucaros with Kashtria Big Bang in the main deck to maximize the damage of these enemies clad in red can do with your fusions</p>"

It is a nice deck that can deal with various other decks (either rogue or meta) and cause some real trouble. I have been testing it the past 2 weeks and all I can say is that is consistent and for opponents that do not expect those 2 archetypes is a nice little surprise. It can easily OTK with the right combos (there are many different ones to be honest because of the Infinitrack and Machina cores) and it has a good amount of interruptions. It is easy to learn but hard to get the timings right and the way to play around different difficulties. I hope you enjoy and try out this Earth Machine variant.&nbsp;</p>

The new Byssted monsters came out in darkwing blast and they are strong. Lubellion is the searcher but the rest of the Byssted monsters can be special summoned from the hand by banishing a light or dark from either GY, and this is a quick eff if the opponent controls a monsters, so they are d.d. crows at times. And each has a unique effect that activates when special summoned or sent to the GY.&nbsp;Magmahut searches at end phase, druiswurm targeting sends a special summoned monster your opponent controls to the GY, and Saronir sends a Byssted monster or Branded spell/trap. They also have a boss monster in Alba Los but he can be very matchup dependet and requires a lot to get out so hes best in the side deck since he's pretty searchable with lubellion and chaos space that if you know he's game winning, you can make him.&nbsp;</p><p>The dogmatika package is something we are all pretty familiar with by now but this time around those sends off nadir servent actually mean more than just a free pop. They also represent a light or dark in the GY to be banished for the Byssted monsters opening up a real use for maximus.The Dogmatika monsters are also all lights, which means once they hit the GY they still have use.&nbsp;</p><p>The chaos monsters are an inclusion of my own choice. Chaos space is basically always live in your oppener by searching either lubellion or one of the chaos monsters, as well as being prime ash bait for your gamma to intercept. Psy-frame gamma are also excellent in this build cause of all the must negates(nadir, chaos space, lubellion) and they can be used as fodder to go into the GY for your Byssted monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>I have had so much fun with this deck. The format right now is flooded with tear, branded, albaz, mathmech, and even spright play a good number of light and darks. The only real downside for this deck right now is it's price so I would suggest playing this mostly on Online servers like Dueling book and Omega.</p>"

Just a fun mash-up of cards. Hope ya'll get a kick out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>As for some of the plays you can make with this...you really just wanna get your Dragonmaids in the GY so they can be equipped to your Cyberdarks. There are plenty of spell cards here that allow you to special summon Dragonmaids as well as cards that allow you to gain additional normal summons of Cyberdarks. Use these to go into Fusions or Link summons in order to set up your GY and then bring out the Cyberdarks to equip them with the Dragonmaids.&nbsp;</p><p>Striker Dragon is just in here as another way to get Dragonmaids into the GY.

The History of Yugioh! Series and The History of Jank Series only shows the historical archetypes that were ""competitively viable"". HOWEVER, there are many more archetypes that have been overlooked. People that watch your channels may only know the names of each archetype, but they may not know how each archetype plays. For example, Gravekeeper's are too slow for the current meta, but are fun and have an interesting playstyle. For this series, you should:</p><p>1) Show a unique archetype - the archetype must be the main focus of the deck, no archetypes that have not many names (e.g. Malicevorous)</p><p>2) Show a playstyle - some archetypes can have different playstyles depending on the cards being played in the deck (e.g. HERO decks can vary in playstyles depending on what is in the main and extra deck)</p><p>3) Use the most recent banlist and card pool - Darkwing Blast just released support for the Blackwing and Amazoness archetypes and yet, neither archetype will be the next SPYRAL deck</p><p>In any case, I plan to show off more of these type of decks such as this one.</p>"

Munin the Runick Wings is a level 3, and because cherubini requires any 2 level 3s to make, any Runick quick-play + level 3 monster can lead to nearly a full Phantom Knight combo.

This allows them to quickly invade the field and enter Rank 4 Xyz Monsters. Examples of good generic Rank 4s include ""Number S39 Utopia Supreme"", ""Daigusto Emeral"", ""Cowboy Gagaga"", etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Fleurdelis Dogmatik, the Knightly Army"" also features a similar Summon condition and supports ""Dogmatik"" monsters by making them gain ATK whenever a ""Dogmatik"" monster declares an attack, allowing for quick victory when combined with the provided swarm. by lower Level monsters.

Accumulating Extra Deck monsters is achieved with their support Spell and Trap Cards, but also with ""Maximus"", sending cards from the Extra Deck to the Graveyard. Because of this, it is recommended that Extra Deck monsters have effects while they are in the Graveyard. Monsters that have a decent Attribute and Type range make ""Archimemeses Eschatos"" and ""Archimemeses Protos"" good optional ""boss monsters"" in the Deck. ""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"" can also help set up the Graveyard. Since ""Nexus"" can be Summoned multiple times per turn, this card makes getting multiple copies of it very easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to its heavy reliance on monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck being on the field and its own inability to Summon them regularly, it is an archetype focused on going second. The opponent who does not Summon a monster from the Extra Deck can also damage the Deck. To make up for this weakness, it is recommended to have a few copies of ""Instant Fusion"" to easily Summon monsters from the Extra Deck (care should be taken when playing ""Dogmatik Punishment"", ""Ecclesia Dogmatik, the Virtuous"", ""Maximus Dogmatik"" and/or or ""Servant Nadir""; as it can throw off one's own strategy if not timed correctly). If ""Thousand-Eyes Limit"" or ""Thousand-Eyes Limit"" is Summoned in this way, they can be used to Link Summon ""Linkuriboh"", instantly giving him a material to Summon ""Maximus"" and with the help of The invoked leaves cards like mechaba and more useful cards and use all the power of the new card White Zoa of Dogmatika</p>"

Necrovalley Dragoon is the anti-meta deck for you! NO GY ALLOWED!,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Necrovalley has been an anti-meta staple since it's inception since it effectively locks down the graveyard. This singular card has slaughtered nearly every deck rogue and meta deck throughout the different eras of competitive Yugioh - Dragon Ruler, Spellbook, Kozmo, Orcust, Sky Striker, Thunder Dragon, Spyral - and more recently, Necrovalley is primed to take on Spright, Ishizu and Tearlaments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dragoon is also a force of nature on it's own - untargetable, indestructible, 3000ATK, omni-negate, it can increase it's own attack and burn up to twice per turn! Dragoon is a ridiculously powerful card, and getting it out is extremely easy as well with Red-Eyes Fusion being easily accessible. The only downside is that Red-Eyes Fusion prevents any summoning for an entire turn, which seriously prevents Dragoon from being usuable in many decks.

After Dragoon's onslaught, you ""checkmate"" your opponent with Necrovalley so they cannot access their graveyard for any play or resources.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted3"">Your win condition is Dragoon and Necrovalley.

It can make You feel like a Professional or like a Novice, it's all about perspective and preference of cards.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Main Deck consists of <strong>40 </strong><em>Main Deck Cards</em>, of which are 37 Spells and 3 Traps, as we can see, it's a deck with 0 Main Deck monsters and that was the whole point of this build, among many other things. <strong>15 </strong><em>Extra Deck Cards</em> and <strong>15</strong> <em>Side Deck Cards</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Main Deck consists mostly of <strong>Runick</strong> Cards, followed by Quick-Play supplements, bait and mind games. Runicks are made to disarm your opponent as you deplete their deck with every card you use, their secondary use is counter and control, as majority of those Runick Cards hit a card(s) on the field You or Your Opponent controls, forcing them to play carefully with every step they make, every breath they take, every card they'll be missing in the process. The Non-<strong>Runick</strong> Cards are there to help You control Your opponent's Monsters and keep them in check.<br /><br /><br />26.6% of the Extra Deck is summonable by 22-25 cards in the Main Deck, as every Quick-Play Runick Spell and <em>Waking the Dragon </em>can special summon any of the <strong>4</strong> Runick Fusions we currently have, beats having to use <em>Instant Fusion</em> anyday.<br /><br />73.3% - 100% of the Extra Deck is summonable with <em>Waking the Dragon</em>, while it's a gamble if your opponent will truly attack your backrow, this deck all but guarantees You will get hit by a backrow wiping effect. If our opponent notices we're using <strong><em>Sky Striker</em></strong> Spells, filler Quick-Play Spells such as <strong><em>Forbidden</em></strong> Cards and the <em>Book of Eclipse</em>, we open up the mind game with them of ""What could it be that's facedown?"" causing them to have a sense of temptation to find out, which puts additional stress on their mind to focus on the match. All Extra Deck monsters handpicked as the best of the best, while it's true there are other candidates that also provide a coverage, these 11 were my own pick in the end. IF You're playing an OCG Version, simply replace <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> for <strong>Thunder Dragon Colossus</strong>.<br /><br />The entire point of the Side Deck is to have a counter to cards that can be an issue to You as a <strong>Runick</strong> player, what better way than with a large <strong>Kaiju</strong> package, along with some backrow wipers and a few ""One Card Solves All"". You're playing Runick people hate when you have cards on your field, especially <em>the</em> Field which is perhaps your most important card in the match. That being said, you will fairly often find yourself with an empty field, that <strong>Evenly Match</strong> makes it so your opponent too feels the sting, slows them down immensely if their entire engine is field based.<br /><br />It's Not a Perfect Deck, no such thing as a Perfect Deck, no such thing as a True Tier 0 deck, never has been, never will be, but this is a deck that can score You a victory when You least expect it, it can provide that unique sense and taste of fun and Victory, even satisfaction and a lesson in Loss.<br /><br />Happy Dueling. <br />-T.B.</p>"

If you can spam enough bodies on board, you can make Tri-Heart or Decode Talker. There's 3 Rexterm in the deck because Kshatri exists now, and once Arise-Heart comes out in the TCG, its gonna be really, REALLY annoying when your important extra deck cards get sent to the Shadow Realm on turn 1.

If a game is forced to time, you are basically guarenteed a loss because your lifepoints will always be lower at the end of whatever phase the game might be in outside of maybe your battle phase.</p><p>That being said. the name of the game is move fast. Shutdown your opponent in the first turn and push for game as soon as possible. going second is a challenge for this deck but not undoable. and when you do know your going second, the evenly matched cleans up nicely&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite play is to prioritize getting at least 2 level 4's on the field at the start of your turn 2 using alert in the opponents end phase. xyz into raider's knight and raider's knight into Arc Rebellion. with usually at least a rextrum or two kentregina's on the field, Arc Rebellion gets HUGE and can swing over any attack position for game. Warning Point helps with this if you catch your opponents off guard when they summon something in attack position looking to use it for a special summon.</p><p>-AA ZEUS is a nice followup with all the xyz access this deck provides.</p><p>*Its important to note you should prioritize getting sonic in the grave as soon as possible or fusing off from the field to mitigate battle damage as Diplos/Therizia are easy targets to swing over if you have been paying lots of life.</p><p>-Recovering with this deck is sometimes hard because you dedicate all the gas in early game. Sometimes its best to scoop and get into the side deck if they shut down your board as it will be a race against time to secure game 3 and you can side in more effective traps for whatever matchup you face&nbsp;</p><p>All in all I think this decks weakness is itself when it comes to competitive play. between the OP effects (like a walking skill drain in rex) and multitude of negates, winning isnt usually the issue. I find myself going to time more often then i like and getting handed a loss even when i have complete control of the board. Definatly my favorite rogue deck by far.</p><p>There is absolutely nothing better than pissing off meta decks playing a bunch of traps&nbsp;</p>"

By using ""Accelerlight"" to Special Summon a ""Galaxy Wizard"", its Level can be changed to 8, and by using ""Galaxy Expedition"" to bring out ""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"" to instantly Summon an Xyz Monster from Rank 8. ""Galaxy Zero"" can be used to revive a Level 8 monster, Normal Summon ""Galaxy Knight"", and revive ""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"" to attach them to ""Galaxy-Eyes Neo Photon Dragon"", ""Number 107 Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"" or ""Number 62 Prime Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The effect of ""Galaxy Wizard"" can search for most of the important Spells and monsters in the Deck, but using its effect leaves your LP exposed.

Also, the Special Summon of ""Thunderer"" allows you to Normal Summon ""Galaxy Knight"" without Tributing in the same turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The inclusion of ""Galaxy Soldier"" combined with ""Galaxy Expedition"" also gives the player the opportunity to incorporate some capable Rank 5 monsters, such as ""Constellation Pleiades"". An excellent combo is to discard a ""Galaxy-Eyes"" with ""Soldier"" to Summon the latter, then use the ""Soldier"" search effect to add a ""Galaxy Knight"" to the hand. ""Galaxy Knight"" can be Normal Summoned and revive ""Galaxy-Eyes"" in the Graveyard, to Special Summon a Rank 8 monster. ""Soldier's"" effect is sometimes used with other LIGHT archetypes, such as ""Kozmo or ""Artifact"" to speed up powerful Rank 5 Xyz Summons like ""Constellation Pleiades"", ""Cyber ​​Dragon Nova"" to ""Cyber ​​Dragon Infinity"".

It is important to mention that you should search first then draw, so you don't draw into garnets like toon-world and spellbook of knowledge. In that case you need to shuffle them back in the deck with magical mallet. Searching also makes your deck thin, which means you get faster to your good cards. The bamboo engine is without a doubt very broken in this deck. Golden bamboo sword gives you free pluses. In my earlier builds I played pot of duality, but since I figured out that magicians souls can also pop the cursed bamboo swords to generate plus 4, I decided to play more special summon focused. With the new bamboo sword, you can equip a cursed bamboo sword directly from your deck so you can pop it with magicians souls, draw and then search another golden. It is very very broken until you find out. We play gold moon coin in this deck to give our remaining piri-reis map or librarys to our opponent to draw 2. Top share is also very good in this deck, topdecking what we want.&nbsp;</p><p>I also played the endymion version with the og endymion and wonder wand loop. Personally I think it is less efficient and much less consistent but for sure funny. If you have any ideas how to optimize this deck even more, feel free to comment, thanks.&nbsp;</p>"

Screw you</p><p>What it comes down to is a 1 card combo with Neiroy searching Ikelos into Friend and into the Phantom Knight combo to search the Quick-Play Rank-up spell and getting Utopia Kaiser onto the field to bring out D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on your opponents turn, actively shutting down their turn.</p><p>It's very consistent since it's a one card combo with one hard garnet. Luckily if you have Dream Mirror of Terror and Neiroy in hand you can tuck back those silly garnets like a Phantom Knight monster or Double-or-Nothing. And if you can't? You can end on a Redoer with trap material, 2 Fog Blades and Tormentor.</p><p>Unfortunately this deck can die to pretty much any handtrap in the game. Which is why we run Crossout and CBTG for obvious reasons!</p><p>""Why is there Jerry Beans Man in here?"" He's a Small World bridge. He's the MVP in this deck, because almost any monster in this deck can bridge with Jerry Beans Man into Neiroy!</p><p>I've been clapping some serious cheeks with this deck.

The deck only uses one combo. The combo can be altered according to hand.,"<p>The deck has 2 main starters: Black Metal Dragon and Starliege Seyfert. The combo usually requires 2 discards. The combo requires 2 dragon monsters on the field to do 2 things: Link summon Striker Dragon then Dragunity Knight - Romulus to add both Field spells: Boot Sector Launch &amp; Dragon Ravine. Activate Dragon Ravine by discarding 1 card to send Absorouter Dragon from deck to GY. Add Rokket Tracer to hand using Absorouter's effect, then activate Boot Sector to SS Tracer.<br />Use Tracer's effect to destroy the field spell special summoning Rokket Recharger from the deck. Link Guardragon Pisty using one of the Rokkets, then link Quadborrel Dragon using the other 2 making sure that both Pisty and Quadborrel point to the same zone and that zone should be empty. Use Pisty's effect to SS 1 dark dragon monster from the banish zone or the GY. Link Dillingerous Dragon using Pisty and the monster you just summoned with Pisty's effect. Activate Quadborrel's effect by discarding 1 card destroying Dillingerous and SS from the GY Tracer and Recharger along with Dillingerous using its own effect. Link Borrelend Dragon using the link monsters and 1 Rokket. Activate Borrelend's effect negating the remaining Rokket on the field and SS the one in the GY. Synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Romulus to it. Now, you have a boss monster that can't be destroyed by card effects or battle, can't be targeted by monster effetcs, can attack all monsters your opponent controls and can negate 1 monster's effect on the field while SS another from your GY along with 2 omni negates from Savage Dragon.<br /><br />For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

Sometimes locals/ranked matches can feel like a drag, it's the same meta decks every time you go, so it just absolutely brightens your day when the Spright player makes Elf to revive Time Wizard, and makes Gigantic to summon one from the deck. Or when the deck uses the Bystial cards to make Beatrice... then pitches Desparado Barrel dragon to add Time Wizard from the deck to hand. This deck has plenty of unexpected plays that look meta untill Time wizard starts flooding the board slowly. The deck's sole purpose is to be a good laugh. Anywho, onto the combos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly we have the spright cards. Time Wizard is a level 2, so they were perfect. Firstly, I should state that Cynet mining is in here to add Draconnet to the hand. Draconnet summons Melffy rabby from the deck, a level 2. So it's a spright extender, most people though, are expecting you to start adding Salamangreat or Mathmech cards. You first make Sprind, who sends TW from the deck to the gy. Then you make Elf who puts that TW onto your board. Then you overlay both link monsters into Gigantic, then detatch a material to summon another TW from the deck. Or, after reviving with Elf, you instead activate Inferno reckless summon to summon 2 TW from your hand/deck/gy for a total of 3 time wizard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next is bystial. During your opponent's turn, summon Magnamuht, who will let you add Druisworm and summon it. Now, at the start of your turn, you can make Beatrice. Detatch a material from Beatrice to send Desperado barrel dragon from your deck to the gy, it's effect will then trigger adding Time Wizard from your deck to your hand. This can be shortened if you just draw Foolish Burial to send Desperado barrel dragon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next up is fusion summoning. For this we have Cyberstein who can summon a TWOT before being linked off for sprind/elf.</p><p>Frightfur fusion adds polymerization and an edge imp to fuse with.&nbsp;</p><p>Theres instant fusion for an instant TWOT</p><p>And lastly you can just draw into magicallized fusion to fuse with a Time wizard that was sent to the gy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next we have the unreleased cards. Ohime and Arabesque. They protect TW/TWOT from destroying itself so that it can reliably use its effect every turn. These cards aren't out yet, but I added them to the list anyways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally we have win condition. The obvious choice here if you scroll down to look at the extra deck for a second, is to burn your opponent to death with Time Wizard of Tomorrow. Jokes aside, it's Selene into Accesscode since Time Wizard is a spellcaster. And theres also Beatrice/Gigantic into Zeus to give you a clear shot at game if your opponent thought your deck had no win con and was goofing slacking to see what your deck could do. I decided on these two though because Zeus wipes things like Time wizard does so it fit with the theme, and you need Time wizard to enable Selene to go into Accesscode. I had to make sure Time Wizard was a piece of every win con.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well thats all on this deck. Sadly, it's way over priced for a joke deck, so if you happen to have the pricy cards from your tournament decks, then I definately reccomend you buy the few cheap cards you need to make the deck so you can spice up the locals next time you go. There's just one thing you meed to remember though, this is a coin flip based deck, so remember the chant ""Tails never fails!"" To increace your odds of calling the flip from 50% to 80%. As alwayse, hope you enjoy!</p>"

the deck, you might hear or even see some of them, but the chance of not knowing some of them are high.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;Main deck&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">- the Bystial Magnamhut: this card doesn't only search any dragon monsters from the deck, it can also add dragon monsters from the graveyard so doesn't matter if you milled the Druidwurm or not you can still add him back, you can also add any extra deck monster from graveyard to the deck, people in OCG always played these 3 as hand traps, and OP monsters to break boards, but it might become unhealthy if you play more than 4 the Bystial monsters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">* There is also a new Bystial coming in Photon Hydra Nova, called the Bystial Baldrake, take look at this card if you had time, it's OP</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">- the Keldo the Sacred Protector: this card is the best of all Ishizu cards, but what exactly should I add to it, well the answer is always been clear, you will add Agido the ancient sentinel, cuz you know for sure you're going to mill cards (for example, you used Keldo to discard Kelbek the ancient Vanguard) so you can use Agido to special summon one of those Ishizu cards you milled and make an easy Rank 4 monster, also if you milled both of your Tearlament Sullieks then special summoned Kitkallos, you can use Mudora or Keldo to shuffle the traps, then add trap with Kitkallos&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">- Tearlament Reinoheart: in the Tearlament Danger deck it is a must to play 3 copies of this card, cuz it's a good starter, but here two copies are what you need, Ishizu cards fixed the milling problem deck had, it even made it better, so in this deck, you always get to mill a Tearlament monster, there is no way you won't mill, you have at least maximum 20 cards mills in 1 turn with this deck.<br /><br />- Diviner of the Herald: with this card, you can mill any Ishizu cards like Agido or Kelbek to mill 5 cards or Mudora or Keldo, in case you've already milled all your Tearlament monsters, now why some people calling Diviner a waste of space in the extra deck, well they play Baronne with Elder entity N'tess but you really don't need to play Elder while you have already cards in your deck does the same thing ( next note ), also deck has 6 normal summons with Diviner, don't ever think you have too many normal summonses in the deck, cuz 6 isn't a high number.<br /><br />- Primeval Planet Perlereino with Mudora or Keldo: field spell says if a Tearlament monster shuffled back into the deck or extra deck, you can target one card on the field and destroy it, so why do you need to play Elder while you have the same mechanic in your deck, which is more consistent then Elder, conclusion 2 copies of Diviner of the Herald isn't waste of space, but you have 2 choose 3 copies of the Merrli with 1 Diviner or 2 copies of both the Merrli and Diviner, both do the same thing but I would rather pick the first one.<br /><br />- Herald of orange light: the chance of drawing this card with one fairy is 80% but it gets nasty if you discard Agido or Kelbek with it, also it's a level 2 tuner so you can make Baronne with this card and Rulkallos&nbsp;<br /><br />- Instant fusion: the best way to use this card, is to add Reinoheart after you summoned Kitkallos then you can special Reinoheart and send Kitkallos to Graveyard to draw more cards.<br /><br />Extra deck<br /><br />- Tearlament Kaleido-heart: summoning this monster in turn 0 without having Tearlament Sulliek or Baronne isn't a good idea, but if you already had Baronne like by summoning with Diviner, you use Barrone to pop Kaleido-heart then you can trigger its effect and send one more Tearlament.<br /><br />- Number 41: Bagooska: my Yugioh experiments showed me, decks that play a dimensional shifter really die to Number 41, and please if you had a way to summon Bagooska under the shifter, please do it even if the cost seems heavy, cuz decks play shifter really die to Number 41, I managed to make Bagooska like 6 times from 10 times I was under the shifter, the last thing you can also summon Bagooska when you bricked to steal some time, hoping for a good top deck.<br /><br />-I:P Masquerena: this card is really broken you only need 2 none-link monsters to make it, and use its effect to link summon Spright Sprind and mill the Merrli then go for fusion summoning Kitkallos and start playing in your opponent's turn.<br /><br />- Borreload Dragon: when you have the game, but cuz of high attack monster you can't win, or cuz of an unkillable monster like Mekk-knight Avramax, this is the best card to steal your opponent's monster, by placing the monster in the link zone this card points too ( no targetting ) and your opponent can't respond to this card activation, conclusion this card is 100% worthy to play.<br /><br />-AA-Arsenal Zeus: I've seen TCG players rarely summon Zeus, but this card is broken to out the boards, and let me tell you, Tearlament loves to be sent to the graveyard by card effects, but how we usually summon this card, when by using number 41 most likely.<br /><br />Side deck:<br />going second:<br /><br />Lava golem: as you saw this deck only has 6 normal summons, and 70% of the time you don't have a normal summons, so lava golem is here to out the boards.<br /><br />Ghost reaper: this card is a game-ender in the mirror match and since the deck is popular among a lot of people, and the main heart of the deck is Kitkallos, you can easily get rid of it, and they lose the game, but if they get lucky to mill, Tearlament Cryme they can recycle it back, and start play again, there is no way to win when your opponent ghost reapers you in the mirror match ( the only exception explained above ), I lost some games in mirror matches because of this card, so OP in the mirror match.<br /><br />Kashtira Fenrir: the best second-going card in the world, out for the continue trap cards ( floodgates ), or banishing monsters face down to bother your opponent lul, you can add a second copy of Fenrir even by using itself, now where is Aussa the earth charmer, well reviving back Fenrir is the only use for Aussa, I leave you to decide between Aussa and I:P Masquerena, I would play Maquerena instead of Aussa.<br /><br />Lightning storm with galaxy cyclone: yes back-row decks are painful, especially Runick, which right now is the most hated deck along with Floowandereeze and of course with dear Mystic mine, guess some People like Fewer IQ decks.<br /><br />Evenly matched: none of the Tearlament decks can make Omni negate except for the Baronne part, so this card is so good right now.<br /><br />&nbsp;First going ( this deck is already strong by going first, but we might need some boost )<br /><br />Triple tactic talents: see your opponent hand, take control of a painful monster your opponent controls, and draw 2 cards, usually, I choose the first one, if I know I can play if my opponent doesn't have one more interruption, but the choice always is yours.<br /><br />Kashtira Fenrir: yes this card is even good when you go First, adding one more interruption is always excepted<br /><br />Tearlament Cryme: to deal with cards like Dark ruler or evenly matched, also to recycle back Kitkallos if she got banished somehow.<br /><br />Last notes:<br />is this deck dies to floodgates? depends if they have Primeval Planet Perlereino with Mudora or Keldo and one Tearlament monster in Graveyard, they can out the Floodgates.<br /><br />is this deck dies to the dark ruler? 80% the answer is not, they have so many ways to mill cards, even in your own turn, so don't play Dark ruler in the main deck, better play in the side deck, now why I don't have Dark ruler in side deck, this deck already strong to deal with the board going first or Second in game 1.<br /><br />what is the right time, to use Our Bystials to banish Tearlament monsters? before they summon Kitkallos, never allow them to summon Kitkallos, never!!<br /><br />if I had 2 Tearlament monsters in the graveyard to trigger their effects, should I use both? yes, if your opponent had a Bystials, they can banish one of them, and you lost your chance for fusion summoning.<br />&nbsp;<br />the End<br /><br />hope I could help you somehow, this was my 4 monthly experiment with this deck on online games, believe me, online games are harder than real-world games, I swear some of these online players are smarter than real-world YuGiOh players but don't have enough money.<br /><br />Till next time we're going to discover Sky striker deck Post Mama ( cringe name lul ) for the new format. Cya<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"
