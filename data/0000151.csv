Lightsworns help abuse Shaddoll graveyard effects, get out Construct for basically free, and since they're light and dark, you can splash in Chaos cards like Envoy the Beginning and Chaos Sorcerer. The only thing about this build that might be a bit iffy for people is the 1 Shaddoll Fusion with... way more than enough Fusion monsters to justify running 3 and you're probably right, but I find the current build works enough for me."

It's easily not the best idea posted on this site, after all, Evilswarms are very exclusive, they were the hardest to try and mix, this definitely isn't even the best Shaddoll deck I have, but again, I haven't a clue as to how well it works, I put it together months ago and just left it there in my EDOPro."

Very fun to play and impcantations make it more consistent. Non-meta.,"Read the ''Important'' part

Black Luster Soldier is my favourite archetype so I have been trying to make a powerful BLS deck and here it is! Please tell me your suggestions so I can make this deck as good as it can be.

This deck uses no banned cards. If you can't get Twilight BLS replace it with sacred BLS and then add another card to the side deck.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: I was having problems putting cards in the side deck,<span><strong> after super soldier reborn is the side deck. </strong>This means that the monster to spells/traps ratio will be incorrect.</span>

Link Black Luster Soldier is purely optional; (If you own it though use it) because its very exspensive and you could accidentally banish by pot of extra's effect.

<strong>Impcantations: </strong>

I used them to increase consistency in the deck. There is no pencilplume, for syntheisis can special summon from the grave. 1x bookstone so you can add syntheisis from your graveyard to your hand.

Rest of the<strong> Main deck </strong>

x2 Super Soldier Reborn: Once you side in Sacred BLS you can use envoy as the target and sacred as the special summon, therefore triggering Sacred's effect.

1x<a data-name=""Envoy of chaos""> Envoy of chaos</a><a data-name=""Envoy of chaos:"">: </a>This card will probably only be used as link and ritual material but if your opponent is using monsters with 3100+ atk you can always add it to your hand with reinforcement of the army.

1x Foolish Burial: If you don't get Super BLS in your hand you can use it to send super to the grave and bring it back with synthesis. Also it can help you summon twilight and <a data-name=""envoy BLS."">envoy BLS. </a>

1x Impcantation Inception: if the only ritual materials available are impcantations add it to your hand with candoll.

<strong>Side Deck</strong> [15 cards]

The side deck is basically an arsenal of handtraps, 3x of the card you want to summon with Reborn (Sacred BLS), and Arisen gaia which is a target for Super BLS.

<strong>Extra deck</strong> [15 cards]

Mainly just so you can use pot of extra but Dark Rebellion and link BLS are summonable and powerful."

I picked up Yu Gi Oh via Duel Links after a 10 year hiatus and so much has changed. Well, this deck was the only free to play one I actually enjoyed on the app. I was excited to learn that it has even more support outside of the limited format. I decided to give this archetype a competitive try and it fairs somewhat well.

This deck recycles very well (if you manage to keep all spell/traps on the field, hence running Ibicella for targeting) Maintaining high LP is key in order to ensure success. for monster that you find difficult to destroy via effect/battle Teardrop can tribute them for an attack boost and help clear the field.

&nbsp;

Edit: Well, looked up other Aroma decks and everything I've listed has been done before and there are similar decks... Apologies

With Aromaseraphy's Majoram, Rosemary, and Jasmine, Ibicella, and Teardrop on the field you have full control. Blessed Winds recycles all of your plant cards and A. Jasmine grants you the ability to re-add  a shuffled monster to the hand (works best for Angelica/Majoram)

This deck isn't full proof by any means, but it is definitely fun to use. It also requires a bit of patience as there are a lot of moving pieces however, with practice, it becomes easier to navigate. I'm not well versed enough to go into more detail about how to use the deck, but as I learn more of the meta I will be updating my decklist summaries. Thanks!"

Forces and Command Knight. Fast forward two (or maybe three? I'm getting forgetful in my old age) and pendulum summoning is just being released and my little lizard brain goes ""no likey"" so I decide to take another hiatus from the game (until either the Valkyries or Backup Gardna are released) up until the Steam winter sale at the end of last year where Yu-Gi-Oh Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution was on sale so I decided to pick it up and give it a play rediscovering my love for the game (still hate pendulum summoning though) and with that we arrive to the current incarnation of what is now a seven year old deck.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The core tactic hasn't changed, you power up your weaker (and stronger) monsters through card effects while protecting them from battle with Marauding Captain. The original deck had Absolute Crusader, Sword Master and Dark Blade the Captain of the Evil World who have since been replaced (partly because I now have better options and partly because I actually forgot the actual contents of the deck) and obviously no link monsters, speaking of whichFerocious Flame Swordsmanis a big boon to the deck as it also powers up the warriors but can also resurrect fallen warriors if it's not in your extra monster zone while Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaosacts as yet another boss monster but for the most part you'll be relying on your level 3 and 4 monsters to do most of the heavy lifting.

&nbsp;

The Attribute Knights are just there to make Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning easier to access although there is a nice combo with an empty hand, Armageddon Knight, Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight and The Warrior Returning Alive where you summon Armageddon Knight, send Gaia then using The Warrior Returning Alive to then summon Gaia from your empty hand, not reliable by any means but a fun combo nonetheless. I will admit that I've not managed to test Dawn Knight in the deck yet but it shouldn't be too different to its dark counterpart."

In any case, the deck, obviously, is built with the strategy of getting ""Morphing Jar"" on the field and just re-use its effect over and over with ""Book of Moon"", ""Book of Taiyou"", ""A/D Changer"", and ""Book of Eclipse"" to deck out your opponent as fast as possible. It's overall a fairly standard build and works about as well as you'd expect it to. Very susceptible to dead draws and having your entire deck stopped with a single Ash Blossom, downloader discretion is advised."

The idea is that there are field spells that can help by special summoning from your deck, or adding a card to your hand, then using those cards to go into other plays. Alternatively, we can use certain field spells to slow down or stop some of your opponent's plays. This is definitely not the theoretical ""best"" build, moreso a proof of concept, and to a degree it works, but I feel like it can definitely be better with a bit of tweaking."

That was until I saw a Photon Change card, a trap with good effect that will almost always increase your resources and there I thought if I did a more Control version of the Deck and so we got to this beautiful deck, the truth is quite fun and I think it is very customizable that's why I brought it here.Monsters.

<strong>Monsters</strong>

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon:</strong> Heart of the Deck at all, most of the cards synergize with him or his family, all 3 copies are necessary.

<strong>Galaxy Knight:</strong> At first I thought it was a bad card, but the ability to not use the normal summon from the Deck makes this card a great play.

<strong>Galaxy Soldier:</strong> Deck searcher which can summon Cyber Dragon Infinity.

<strong>Photon Trasher:</strong> Good monster to summon.

<strong>Photon Vanisher:</strong> Of the best cards on the deck, it is summoned almost always in addition to add a Galaxy-Eyes.

<strong>Photon Advancer:</strong> Reverse Trasher.

<strong>Orbital Photon:</strong> The true searcher of the archetype.

<strong>Photon Lizard:</strong> A copy is fine to add combo pieces, unfortunately it takes away the possibility of summon Knight.

<strong>Photon Sanctuary:</strong> Very good card, you can use it to summon Galaxy-Eyes, use Photon Change effect and the most useful, summon the Link.

<strong>Galaxy Expedition:</strong> Very good card to win a high monster.

<strong>Photon Stream of Destruction:</strong> A galaxy-eyes is easy to summon so it will almost always be usable, the gain of being used on the enemy turn gives a great bonus to this versión of the deck.

<strong>Photon Change:</strong> The card that started it all, is a trap yes but it is quite good it can take advantage of monsters that your opponent is going to destroy and gain more resources such as a Galaxy-Eyes that you need, and if you use the Galaxy-Eyes this card will give you double power, well in case you need it, the only bad thing is that it self-destructs for no reason.

<strong>Tachyon Transmigration:</strong> Negation of the archetype is like a Stream of Destruction but it negates, and with the plus of negating more than one effect, returning the cards to the Deck and being able to be used from the hand.

<strong>Extra Deck</strong>

<strong>Full Armor Photon Dragon: </strong>Switch to a Galaxy Xyz, for destruction and 4000 ATK is pretty good.

<strong>Prime Photon Dragon: </strong>OTK Moment.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>It can help ... I swear.

<strong>Hope Harbinger: </strong>Very good negation for the Deck in first turn.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon: </strong>It can help with some cheese games, I still take it for the tramp.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: </strong>Second option to negation on first turn.

<strong>Cyber ​​Dragon's: </strong>Infinity is great and being able to summon it so easily with Soldier makes it mandatory for the Deck.

<strong>Starliege Lord Galaxion: </strong>Take advantage of Level 4 to summon Galaxy-Eyes from the Deck if it is not in hand.

<strong>Starliege Paladynamo: </strong>OTK Moment.

<strong>Starliege Photon Blast Dragon: </strong>Level 4 will almost always summon this to put the Galaxy-Eyes on the field, protect it and summon it again.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon: </strong>The link is easy to invoke with Sanctuary so it is always good to carry copies of it, it recovers resources and it can also destroy cards<strong>.</strong>

<strong>Union Carrier: </strong>Another good Link, can put Orbital.

<strong>Other Things</strong>

<strong>Impermanence and Warning Point</strong>: A few good traps help the deck, in my case Impermanence is possibly the best current trap and Warning Point is quite good, to negate effect, summon of various monsters.Other Options

<strong>Other Options: </strong>

<strong>Galaxy Monstes:</strong> Afterglow Dragon is easy to summon and gain recurse, sometimes brick, also is more  OTK that a control, Wizard is good, he changes levels and searches but he is like Lizard and almost always worse, Cloudragon is a good card that can revive Galaxy-Eyes and he is also a ""Galaxy-Eyes"" that can be Normal Summon, Neo Galaxy-Eyes can make “things”, Galaxy Satellite Dragon another link although it is not so good.

<strong>Galaxy Spell/Traps:</strong> Photon Hand is an interesting card it can steal Monsters although it blocks you if you do not have the Galaxy-Eyes so that's why they are not used, Galaxy Trance is a bit instaXYZ, Galaxy Zero is the reborn of the archetype.

<strong>Number 97:</strong> Draglubion is one of that cards that can do some interesting things with, Numeron Dragon and C107 but it’s not that good in this version, also with have Barian Force if you just want the C107.

<strong>Generics: </strong>Guardian of Order is sometimes good to have but not that good a 3, Not just Cosmic Cyclone you can use Twin Twisters, Space Typhoon or Galaxy Cyclone this are for destroy Backrow Because the deck is not that good in that, Zeuz is just to good.

&nbsp;

<strong>Thing you should Know</strong>

As I said before you can put the traps you want I put those because they are the ones I like the most but if you want you can put yours.

Learn how to use Photon Change, seriusly.

You should also know that Xyz to use at all times, using the right one can help a lot.

As I said before, the deck is highly customizable, there are several Galaxy, Photon, Cipher, Galaxy Eyes cards and these can give different touches to the deck.

<strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>

<strong>S-Force: </strong><strong>The newest thing in the trunk of ideas, it is not very special but currently I am really enjoying playing with this deck.</strong>

<strong>Abhyss:</strong> Well F, I had ideas but they did not work so well and I would not want to do something of the lot so I’m keep thinking.

<strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> As I said before, practically ready, I will only think about uploading it this month or the next if I do not have ideas.

<strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> A little bit the same, it is ready although I think it is more likely that this will upload it this month.

Also first day of March.

If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment."

I have cut the 2 copies of Kuribandit, as well as the Eldlich stuff and I wanted to with more of a pure Draco Route. I do play some Monarch cards and a spellbook engine. Domain got cut to 1 copy as I found it clashes with Diagram, which is the more important field spell. This build could benefit from a Set Rotation, but I decided not to include it because the space is tight. I wanted to go with a 40 card build and Upstart would be the 41st card kekw. Also, the inclusion of Metaltron because this deck needs a decent boss monster. I found that sometimes the deck has trouble getting that big push for game and Dinomight, Ignis and Maiden sometimes (and regularly) isn't enough to push for game. Metaltron helps out with the potential to be immune to everything but also being pretty big, and with Diagram/Dreith on the field it might take a turn or two before your opponent can out him. Overall I am much happier with this build overall, and in my testing has been a little more powerful as well with the help of Metaltron and some of the newer additions. Hope you like the update."

So I gave it a shot and, while the build definitely has potential to be something decent, the amount of dead draws that I found the deck gives me is a little more than it's worth.

This build focuses probably more than it should on using ""Ogdoabyss, Deity of the Abhyss""s destruction effect,  and after blowing up the field, beating your opponent with a 3100 ATK point monster, and, if that doesn't work, just using ""Evil Dragon Ananta"" late game to finish the job."

I don't know what you want out of me.,"So this was a deck I made that I don't exactly remember the why as to it's creation. It's a deck that is built on the very simple gimmick of sheep-based monsters, and what they can do. It's by no means a ""great"" deck, (honestly, I don't think really any of the decks I build are ""great"", but that's neither here nor there.)

The main strategy of the deck I find to be the most useful is utilizing the tokens of Scapeghost and Sheep Cloud to either go into link plays leading into ""Unchained Abomination"", a fusion summon of ""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"", or a synchro summon of ""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"". But the funny enjoyment of beating your opponent with ""Token Stampede"" seemed to have been what the original build was created on before I attempted to make it... somewhat work consistently.

Overall though, it's a slow deck that isn't by any means ""competitive"" or ""good"", but it's still a weird gimmick that I wanted to show off as I try to backup the decks I've built on EDOPro."

The ""Traptrix"" archetype features a small arsenal of Level 4 monsters which not only interact with their own archetype but also search an play ""Hole"" Normal Trap cards quite extensively. Together with their Extra Deck monsters in form of two Link and two Xyz monsters, they stop the opposing monster summons to create an opening for attacks. But let us take a look at what cards I have thrown together for better understanding:</p>
<p>The Main Deck features of the following monster cards: Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" work as our Normal Summons, with ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" searching the deck for a ""Hole"" Normal Trap card on Normal Summon, while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" gives us access to a ""Traptrix"" monster from the deck when Normal Summoned. Both are also useful outside of being Normal Summoned with ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>"" bringing an in-archetypal backrow removal effect while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" can bounce the own backrow and set cards from the hand as a Quick Effect, which has some interaction with archetypes like ""Artifacts"" but mainly serves to dodge targeting effects like ""<a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"" in this deck. One of the targets for the search effect of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>"" is ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"", the newest Main Deck monster and a solid member of the archetype overall. For the cost of sending one of your ""Hole"" Trap cards to the graveyard she can Special Summon herself from the hand, therefore giving you another body on the field if every works out without disruption while giving you another try at building a board if the Normal Summon was negated earlier that turn. She also can banish herself from the graveyard to recycle a Trap card from your graveyard which also help fighting the battle against the opposing summons. ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"" also helps the deck by sending a Trap to the graveyard by giving a solid start to the last two ""Traptrix"" Main Deck monsters in this deck in form of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" and a single copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Genlisea"">Traptrix Genlisea</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" is very useful since she offers more Trap recycling on Special Summon and can therefore bring the Trap back the ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Ginalloa"">Traptrix Ginalloa</a>"" used while ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>"" is also the ""Traptrix"" version of a ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" on legs when Normal Summoned. ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Genlisea"">Traptrix Genlisea</a>"" has only one effect, but she is no slouch either since she can tribute herself to fetch two Trap cards, one from the deck and one from the graveyard, to put onto your field. The rest of the Main Deck monsters is made up of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>"", which can Special Summon itself as a Level 4 monster when you summon your Link-1 monster in form of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"" and then fetches another copy of itself from the deck which also enters the field as a Level 4 monster and therefore sets you up nicely to go into a Rank 4 Xyz summon. Lastly, I play three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for the obvious use as a handtrap against deck searching effects the opponent might try to pull off.</p>
<p>The Spell card section, as you can see, is quite barren with only a single copy of ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" which is used for the ""Utopia Double"" engine and basically allows you to produce a 10000 ATK beater as a Rank 4 Xyz monster. There are a few more Trap cards though: I run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" as a solid Trap card searching option, and its effect is also the reason why so many of the Trap cards are in the deck as a pair. ""<a data-name=""Time Space Trap Hole"">Time Space Trap Hole</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare"">Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a>"" all are in the deck at a copy count of two and all provide destruction, negation and/or control effects in various situations. The non-""Hole"" Trap cards consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>"" to gain additional bodies for Rank 4 Xyz summons and, more importantly, to trigger ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"" during your first turn without the delay you would normally have when playing Trap cards. An additional three copies of ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"" keeps the opposing effect monsters at bay.</p>
<p>The Extra Deck looks as follows: Xyz-wise, there is one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Traptrix Rafflesia</a>"" as field protection for your other ""Traptrix"" monsters and as a handy effect to fire off ""Hole"" Trap card directly from the deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Allomerus"">Traptrix Allomerus</a>"" for various summoning schenanigans, the ""Utopia Double"" package featuring one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"" to ram into your opponent for the aforementioned 10000 ATK, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>"" as a stall option,  one copy of ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" as Quick Effect backrow removal, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" to keep the opponent from using the graveyard. The Link monsters feature three copies of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>"", who is your main play-enabler which searches and summons/places monsters and Traps directly from the deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Traptrix Utricularia"">Traptrix Utricularia</a>"" as a fun little gimmick and solid option in grind games, one copy each of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" to destroy backrow/frontrow respectively while having the big boy to send things back into the deck, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" for the usual beatdown/game-ending Link-4 play.</p>
<p>While certainly not my favorite deck playstyle-wise, I do have to admit that these carnivorous girls can put quite a nasty board together, and the newest support cards helps them both in making the deck more viable while also providing the creative players with more tools and gimmicks to make use of. The times when ""Traptrix"" only really worked as an engine together with some other archetype are definitely over, they form a solid deck that rightly deserve the amount of fans it gathered over the years.

<a>Here's a link to the game that comes out on March 6th.</a>

Now with that stuff out of the way, did you like the last format of MR4 being turned by SPYRAL? Did you cry when Master Plan was banned? Do you believe that SPYRAL can come back at (almost) full power? Then do I have the format for you! Introducing Dimension Duels X on Roblox. In this custom format, you can have fun with all of your friends in this absolute atrocity of a format that proves why Yu-Gi-Oh players should never be trusted with brain cells.

But really though, the makers of this banlist must have been in an ""unpurified"" state or they simped for Master Plan because SPYRAL should never have this many cards off the list and this deck attempts to prove that.

This deck and monstrosity of a banlist should prove to you why the players should never be in charge of the banlist and why some decks are hit more than others."

big monster alert!!!","If you don't know what clock is then I'll tell you, it's a small cyberse ""archetype"" that uses the card cynet fusion. I found out recently about how broken the link 2 clock lizard is.

&nbsp;

<span>So I’ve played a few matches, this deck is a going second consistent OTK deck that can play through about three negates (unless one is a nibru) before crumbling apart from my experience so far. I’ve been cleaning players clocks (pun totally intended) with one attack. You may argue with some of my choices but I believe that every card in the deck works the way I want it to but I’ll still be open for advice for things to add.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>In the guide below I’ll explain the list, why I picked the cards, and the combos</span>

&nbsp;

<span>List:</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 clock wyvern (an absolutely necessary 3 of in this deck, you have 9 cards in the deck that’ll open it for you)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 RAM clouder (summons a cyberse from the grave, you can replace it with something like swap cleric)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 ROM cloudia (mainly for backup and converter, latency comes up, but rarely)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 lady debug (get converter or secretary to help start your main combo)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 cyberse gadget (I love this card for it’s ability to be 3 monsters in one, mainly to start combo)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 widget kid (two for one to start combo)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 backup secretary (powerful extender in this deck)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 defcon bird (graveyard setup and monster on the field)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 cyberse converter (quick body, extender or starter if necessary)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 swap cleric (none of the link monsters in this deck need their attack points because you’re giving them to clock dragons so it’s just an easy draw)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 stack reviver (extender, helped me out a lot)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 dotscaper (easy to get out on the field, it’s also a two for one so use it)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 latency (for the draw)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 cynet fusion (key card in the deck)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 cynet mining (search, sometimes clock wyvern, sometimes a way to get two monsters)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 fusion conscription (quick access to clock wyvern)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>2 cyberse clock dragon (win condition, one swing for the kill)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 diplexer chimera (safey and latency)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 code talker inverted (extender)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>3 clock lizard (heart and soul of the deck, I couldn’t have made this combo work without it, also it’s banish effect is not a once per turn so you can stack multiple if you used extenders)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 security dragon (if you used an extender then this can provide clearance)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 secure gardna (fusion material, explained later)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 clock spartoi (cynet fusion search)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 link devotee (despicable-devotee)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 link despicable (despicable-devotee)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 linkguriboh (for the big dragon)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>1 linkuribloh (for the big dragon)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The combo: </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Materials: clock wyvern and a way to get two cyberses out (gadget also works in this spot), go second, it’s okay to have the clock wyvern in your hand because of fusion conscription.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Summon the two cyberses</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link cyberse one to make despicable</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link cyberse two to make devotee</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Despicable eff tribute devotee to draw one and put one on the bottom</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Devotee summons two tokens</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link one token for linkuriboh</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link likuriboh and despicable for clock spatoni</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Spatoni searches cynet fusion (whatever you do do not use spatoni’s second effect)</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link other token for linguriboh</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link linguriboh to make secure guardna</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Activate cynet fusion to fuse guardna with clock wyvern for a cyberse clock dragon</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link clock dragon with spatoni to make clock lizard</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Lizard eff tribute self put clock dragon into extra deck then banish every link monster in your grave to make cyberse clock dragon again</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Clock dragon then chain lizard</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Lizard weakens all special summoned monsters your opponent owns by 400 points for every cyberse in the grave</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Clock dragon mills cards on top of the deck to the grave for every link rating (link 2 = two cards for example) you used to summon it, if the combo was done normally then you’ll send 9 cards, for every card milled you gain 1000 attack points (if combo done normally then this totals up to 11500), attack a weakened monster and win game</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Alt note, if you have two spare cyberses in your hand you can use cynet fusion to fuse them to summon your diplexer then have it tribute itself, lock the spells and traps out of the battle phase and recycle cynet fusion.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Alt note, use the extenders to help get more link monsters in the grave if possible to boost your clock dragon, clock lizard’s banished effect is not once per turn so you can use it multiple times in a turn allowing for you to stack a lot of debuffs and make it so that you to swing for game more easily.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>I love the deck, the combo took some time to get used to but overall it’s really good and I find I'm able to end games very quickly and consistently using this combo.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>(my record is 17500, if you use this deck then tell me yours!)</span>"

Since the banlist hit of Dinowrestler Pankratops and Red Reboot, I've started to explore rogue control decks that can keep up with meta decks, in the end the deck that I think that fits in those category is Altergeist. This archetype is really good at disrupting your opponent while gaining more resources, it can also fit in handtraps without losing it's consistency, which is important in the current meta due to the fast paced playstyle of decks nowadays.

Like what people says, ""The deck is only as good as its user"" this deck certainly lives up to that phrase, it's deadly when it's in the hand of a person who knows how to utilize it. As a control deck you need to study the decks that will be used by your fellow duelists, knowing which card to disrupt is the key factor for you to achieve victory.

<strong><span>Deck Component Explanation</span></strong>

<span>Altergeist Cards - A standard ratio of altergeist cards. I think most of the altergeist decks have the same ratio as this one because adding or subtracting of these cards will lower it's consistency.</span>

Handtraps - Handtraps are important in this fast paced meta, allowing your opponent to complete their combo without disruption is like asking to lose.
<ul>
 	<li>Ash Blossom is a must have since it can stop adding cards to the hand.</li>
 	<li>The PSY-Frame bundle is my second favorite handtrap in this deck since it can disrupt your opponent and at the same time it can protect you from your opponent's handtraps.</li>
 	<li>The last but not the least is my favorite handtrap in this deck, Infinite Impermanence, it synergize well with altergeist because you can trigger multifaker after you activate it.</li>
</ul>
Solemns - At first I was planning to put 3 judgment, but after I analyzed the meta, putting striker would be a good idea and since we have Imperial Order, it can make up for the other judgment.

Imperial Order - It's a good card in this control deck since this deck doesn't have many spell cards.

Extenders -
<ul>
 	<li>One for one is a must in an altergeist deck because it's an additional meluseek.</li>
 	<li>Running one Three Tactical Talents is a good idea since it's versatile, you can use it's draw 2 if your extravagance or meluseek has been negated by ash blossom, or you can use it's take control effect to steal one of your opponent's monster.</li>
</ul>
Pot of Extravagance - Your one and only draw power card (not considering Three Tactical Talents). You can use this a bait for your opponent's handtrap to chain psy-frame gamma.

Forbidden Droplets - Just in case you lose the dice roll, you can use this to break your opponent's board that takes them 10 minutes to make, only to be destroyed by a control deck.

Extra Deck - The extra deck cards are pretty handy depending on the situation.
<ul>
 	<li>PSY-Framelord Omega - After you successfully resolve psy-framegear gamma, synchro summon this card to do it's thing.</li>
 	<li>Borrelsword Dragon - In some cases that you need to finish the game fast because you feel the you can't control the game if it goes longer, have no worry as you have this card. Just pray that it doesn't get banish by pot of extravagance.</li>
 	<li>Accesscode Talker - BOARD WIPE!!!!</li>
 	<li>Knightmare Unicorn - If there is a card that limits your movement on the field, return it to the deck using this card.</li>
 	<li>Primabanshee - Can be used to summon multifaker.</li>
 	<li>Selene - An easier way to get your link 4 monsters</li>
 	<li>Knightmare Phoenix - Same as knightmare unicorn but replace ""return it to the deck"" with ""destroy""</li>
 	<li>Hexstia - Your favorite extra deck monster. Use this card against monsters that is not affected by card effects and has a big attack. Negate the spell/trap of your opponent. And add an alteregist card from your deck to your hand</li>
 	<li>Linkuriboh - To trigger meluseek effects and to waste your opponent's attack.</li>
 	<li>Almiraj - To trigger meluseek and silquitous.</li>
 	<li>Anima - To trigger meluseek and equip your opponent's monster to this.</li>
</ul>
Side Deck -
<ul>
 	<li>Nibiru - THE ROCK!!!!!! To stop combo decks.</li>
 	<li>HFD - Sweep your opponent's backrow.</li>
 	<li>DRNM - Part of the 2 card deadly combo.</li>
 	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - To get rid of your opponent's backrow. It's more effective against eldlich</li>
 	<li>Evenly Matched - Part of the 2 card deadly combo.</li>
 	<li>Summon Limit - Effective to completely control swarm decks.</li>
 	<li>Imperial Iron Wall - Effective against banish decks and ELDLICH</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Budget Friendly Alternatives</span></strong>

Three Tactical Talents - Book of Moon, It can bait your opponent's negates and can be use to disrupt their combo.

Pot of Extravagance - Pot of Duality, It is what it is.

Forbidden Droplets - Water Kaiju and Wind Kaiju, the downside of using this is you're gonna have a hard time against drytrons.

Accesscode Talker - Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax, Instead of a board wipe, you can just summon this card as a boss card.

<strong><span>Reminders</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>As a control deck it's important to study other decks in order to know when is the right time to disrupt them.</li>
 	<li>Do not rush to end the game quickly (unless you cannot control your opponent any longer), remember you're using a control deck.</li>
 	<li>Know how to play around when most of your extra deck cards are banished.</li>
 	<li>After you activate altergeist manifestation, you can chain personal spoofing to return altergeist manifestation to your deck, in that way you can special summon an altergeist monster in your gy without the trap card being sent to the gy.</li>
</ul>

Because, quite simply, people know what the Phantom Knights do. Raidraptors on the other hand? Not nearly as well known.

As you may have noticed, this list is quite similar to MBT's, which is because this is based off his TMT video. However, I have made a few tweaks to make it *slightly*

more affordable, and a tad more resilient. I showcase this deck on my YouTube channel, so If you want to se how it performs, check out YGOmega."

updated the deck with yugitubers suggestions as after testi","the main strategy of this deck is to always try and end with a roar or a rage on the field or both search out gazelle off of cynet mining or lady debug if you discard a salad card from cynet mining you will be able to special summon gazelle straight away if you draw flame bufferlo and lady debug i would personally play lady debug over flame bufferlo as gazelle is really important to get in hand as soon as possible send whatever you need to the graveyard from gazelles effect if you already have roar and rage in hand if not send roar or rage off gazelles effect you want to go into a balelynx search for sanctuary off of balelynx effect this is the one of the first decks i ever made myself i hope you enjoy thank you for checking it out :)

UPDATE:

added Number 75: Bambooozling Gossip Shadow and side decked Salamangreat Mole from FeeshSlayers suggestions thank you Feeshslayer :)

Now, its main strategy is to swarm the field with Link monsters to give both offense and defense (maybe an Extra Link at the end if you're lucky) the first turn and win the Duel on the third turn.

this is my first Deck upload on this site.

It is a Deck for casual play, that i used to play with my friends.

The ""main"" play of the Deck is to make I:P, set Geargiagear and go into Apollousa during your opponents turn.

Normal a Geargiano -&gt; Link into Almiraj to trigger Parallel eXceed is another cool ""play"" in case you brick with the Geargianos.

If you survive until turn 3, rank 4 plays are the way to go. The Machina cards add an explosiveness and the ability to grind to the deck.

Vespenate is the budget option to AA-Zeus.

The Deck dies basically to every Handtrap, has not to many options going second and is sometimes bricky.

Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)

Have a nice day everyone!"

</span><span>This deck is an odd one in my opinion. As far as I'm aware, there are no Magician of Faith / Needle Worm decks out there in the same sense as this deck.</span></span>

<span>The aim of this deck is to make your opponent draw out. Easy, right? It may seem unconventional and does require some patience, however I can assure you that this deck is more than capable of putting up a fight against some tougher decks. </span>

<span>Let's talk strategy. There are 2 main parts to this deck: the mill power, and the protect/prevent part (PPP :P)</span>

<span>PPP - I was hesitant to include it at first, but Mystic Mine will be your main form of protection in this deck. I know how frustrating it can be to less experienced players, which is why I was on and off about the idea, however, I finally gave in; sorry Swords of Revealing Light, you just won't cut it. To back up the Mystic Mine we have Field Barrier. This protects the mine from being destroyed by opponents, but also by it's own effect. Get both on the field and you're pretty much set - just make sure to play MM <strong>BEFORE </strong>FB. This deck also features the classic Battle Fader. You could exchange it for Swift Scarecrow which would probably be better, but I prefer Battle Fader :)
<span>I have also included 3 copies of Threatening Roar. I think this card works perfectly for this deck. It can stop attacks, but due to it's nature, it can also be used to allow <b>only a few attacks through</b></span>. This means that you can let your opponent clear your board a little to make way for new monsters, while also reaping the benefits of their effect and then preventing any further assault, should you find yourself in a situation without Mystic Mine's effect.</span>

<span><span>Now for the mill power - there is of course the Needle Worm, which is better for situations where you need to mill your opponent quickly before it's too late. Make use of the Book of Moon/Taiyou to gain the worm's effect more than once per turn, leaving devastating amounts of your opponent's deck strewn to the grave. However there is one more little loop if you will in this deck. It is a simple, 2-card combo that works really well in my opinion, the Magician of Faith and Book of Eclipse (Bare in mind this only works if your opponent controls at least 1 non-link monster). Basically, you'll have a magician on the field. Activate the book and flip all monsters face-down. At the end of the turn, your opponent's will be flipped up, and they'll draw a card for each. For maximum gain from this little combo, activate the book as your opponent enters their battle phase; it'll prevent them from attacking :) (Chain to their End Phase if they skip battle). Then, during your turn, flip your magician, recover the book and repeat.
</span><span>By having other magicians or worms on the field as well as this, you'll also be able to trigger their effects every turn, essentially allowing you to reuse spells and mill your opponent's deck indefinitely. This comes in handy for cards like The Shallow grave, where you can constantly reuse them, giving your opponent more and more monsters to fuel your combo.</span></span>

<span>Cup of Ace in this deck is a win-win card. If you flip heads, you get 2 cards closer to fulfilling your combo. If tails, well your opponent has another 2 cards shaved from their deck</span>

<span>Other cards in the deck are mainly draw power to help get the cards you need. The extra deck is mainly fodder for Extravagance, and can consist of any cards you wish, but the cards I've listed can come in handy in particular situations. I would like to note that the underrated card Clara and Rushka, the Ventriloduo is also included. If you don't fancy suiciding your Sangan or WotBF, then this link monster can also do the trick. Unfortunately, it can only be summoned during MP2, although this deck doesn't require any attacking anyways, so it works out pretty well, and it can easily be taken off the board with a Phoenix or Cerberus. What else.. Metaverse is self-explanatory, and so is Ojama Trio (give your opponent more monsters to fulfil Mystic Mine's conditions)</span>

<span>Something I would like to mention when it comes to playing this deck is this: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO PASS THE TURN! Sometimes it is better to just wait for cards to be drawn rather than playing every single move possible. One thing I've found is that it is very easy to find yourself with an abundance of Threatening Roars and Battle Faders, so even if you haven't got the mine, you'll always have a backup :)</span>

<span>Potential weaknesses to this deck that I've found are archetypes such as Kaijus and Monarchs that are able to tribute your monsters. Unfortunately, I have not found a way around this yet, but I'll be sure to update if and when I do. I also saw a guy who was running Monarchs and had a trap that would put spells/traps from their grave back into the deck, which allowed them to stall to victory.</span>

<span>This is my first upload on here and I hope that someone will find a good laugh in my quirky little creation here. Good luck duelists!
<span>Feel free to contact my Discord to discuss this or any of my future decks with me, or even just brag about a sweet win you got with it - Katsuki#8104 :)</span></span>"
