Obliterate!!!,"<p>An 'Exodia Smoke' Deck for Yugi/Kaiba format (May 2002). Obliterate!!!</p><p><strong>Exodia Smoke:</strong> This deck only works if your opponent doesn't know what you are doing. It's a very complicated deck to run. Be smart Game 2, don't use your Last Wills too early, wait until you have drawn 2 Exodia pieces already, protect your Hane-Hanes so you can bounce an Exodia piece back to your hand, use Card Destruction when you have 1 piece and bring it back with Monster Reborn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The initial deck tries its hardest to look like a normal deck, but every card choice is important.</p><p>EXAMPLE 1: The best draw spell is Card Destruction. You need to use it to draw to Exodia faster, but what if you have some pieces in your hand already? Simple: Summon the Exodia Piece then activate Card Destruction, then return the Exodia piece to your hand with either Hane-Hane or by attacking your opponent's Wall of Illusion. However many people don't run Wall of Illusion in their main deck anymore because they fear it being exploited by Man-Eater Bug therefore, to make sure they side in Wall of Illusion for Game 2 DON'T MAIN MAN-EATER BUG.</p><p>EXAMPLE 2: You definitely need your Swords of Revealing Light for Game 2 so to ensure that your opponent doesn't keep/put thier De-Spell in for Game 2 DON'T MAIN SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT.</p><p>EXAMPLE 3: After seeing Exodia Game 2 your opponent will hopefully side in Card Destruction, and if you managed to activate yours 3-4 times in the first 2 duels they will be very scared of losing the monsters in their hand now that you're both running it, so they will over commit and you will activate your newly sided in JUST DESSERTS for Game 3.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>GAME 2 SIDE OUT:</strong></p><p>Summoned Skull (2x)<br />Neo The Magic Swordsman (2x)<br />Battle Ox (2x)<br />Wicked Worm Beast (1x)<br />Fissure (1x)<br />Soul Exchange (1x)<br />Reinforcements (2x)<br />Trap Hole (1x)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GAME 2 SIDE IN:</strong></p><p>Exodia The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Left Arm Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Left Leg Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Right Arm Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Right Leg Leg Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Hane-Hane (x1)<br />Man-Eater Bug (x3)<br />Last Will (x1)<br />Swords of Revealing Light (x2)</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>GAME 3 SIDE OUT:</strong></p><p>Exodia The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Left Arm Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Left Leg Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Right Arm Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Right Leg Leg Of The Forbidden One (x1)<br />Hane-Hane (x3)<br />Giant Soldier of Stone (x2)<br />Last Will (x3)<br />Card Destruction (x2)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GAME 3 SIDE IN:</strong></p><p>Summoned Skull (2x)<br />Neo The Magic Swordsman (2x)<br />Battle Ox (2x)<br />Wicked Worm Beast (1x)<br />Fissure (1x)<br />Soul Exchange (1x)<br />Reinforcements (2x)<br />Trap Hole (1x)<br />Just Desserts (x3)</p>"

The idea with this deck is to overwhelm your opponent, so Swords is a little slow, but you don't know the match up game 1 so it's harder to do that.

Searchable with Illusion of Chaos. You can use Magician's Salvation as tribute to summon Timaeus after using it's effect to set Eternal Soul. Getting him in your opening hand is not the worst thing, if you can get a DM onto the board or at least into your hand, provided that you have something suitable as tribute to special him to the board.</p><p><strong>1x Palladium Oracle Mahad:</strong> Allows you to draw more with Soul Servant, nice if you pitch it with Illusion of Chaos or Soul Servant and draw it on the following turn or of Soul Servant's effect.</p><p><strong>1x Dark Magician Girl:</strong> More draws with Soul Servant, can be dumped to the GY by Magician's Souls. You never want to draw her, but she can be special'd from the hand or deck by The Dark Magicians effect.</p><p><strong>3x Magician's Rod:</strong> Search any DM spell with this, tribute it for Timaeus or link it off to the GY with Artemis to bounce it back on the opponent's turn.</p><p><strong>3x Magician's Souls:</strong> Can dump DM, DMG, Mahad and Illusion, to either summon itself and get rid of up to 2 spells (like Magician's Salvation after setting Eternal Soul) from either the field or hand and draw up to 2 new cards. If you already have Eternal Soul set you ideally want to use this to draw and not to special a DM to the field, unless you really need the DM on the field in that turn to fusion into Dragoon or Dragon Knight.</p><p><strong>2x Illusion of Chaos:</strong> The reason why this deck actually works. Can search you any monster you need to advance your combos and pitch a brick back to the deck. You really want to put your best efforts into getting this into your hand on turn 1. If there is no more deck shuffling to do, you can also put the card itself back on the deck to draw it on the following turn or with Soul Servant. It's on board effect is also useful to negate and bounce itself back, but I actually never had myself summon this to the board with Secrets of Dark Magic at all. If neccessary, you can fetch Mahad with this, pitch it and draw it with either SS, Magician's Souls or just on the following turn.</p><p><strong>3x Ash Blossom:</strong> We want to play the best handtrap in the game.</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1ge56hdqjp"">Spells</h3><p><strong>2x Dark Magicial Circle:</strong> You could run 3, but 2 is just fine. You can use both of its effects in one turn. Use it to get a card you need off of your deck and banish whatever your opponent has on the field after summoning a DM. Works like a charm with Eternal Soul and can be protected by Dragon Knight.</p><p><strong>1x Magician's Salvation:</strong> Essentially makes your deck a 39 card deck, sets Eternal Soul, can be fetched by Terraforming. Can be used to special Timaeus or used by Magician's Souls for draw. The secondary effect of specialing a DMG after a DM has been summoned and vice versa is also handy.</p><p><strong>2x Secret Village of the Spellcasters:</strong> Does your opponent rely on spells? Then play this card, if not, side it out for something more useful.</p><p><strong>1x Dark Magic Attack: </strong>Same as above, basically a searchable Feather Duster in this deck.</p><p><strong>3x Preparation of Rites:</strong> Basically means you run 5 copies of Illusion of Chaos and now a 36 card deck. Do you have Illusion of Chaos already in hand? Dump this with Magician's Souls and draw something new.</p><p><strong>1x Terraforming:</strong> After Magician's Salvation and Preparation of Rites, this means you now run a 35 card deck. Obviously even better if you have Secret Village in your main deck. Possibly better to replace it with Crossout or Called by if you don't.</p><p><strong>2x Secrets of Dark Magic:</strong> Quick-Play fusion, use it during the battle phase or on your opponent's turn. The Ritual Summoning effect is rather niche.</p><p><strong>3x Soul Servant:</strong> What could be better than running a 35-36 card deck? Exactly, additionally having the ability to draw up to 3 cards with one of them being either a recycled one or the exact one you need. This card has a ton of different use cases and is like a swiss-army knife. The main reason why we play 2 bricks in Mahad and DMG. Get either of them on the GY and this card is already a +1. The main thing you want to search with Rod unless you have no way to fusion or no suitable monster on the field or in the GY to draw and even then you can still use it to put something useful (back) on your deck to draw it with any other effect.</p><p><strong>3x Super Poly:</strong> Break any board with Garura, Mudragon, Dragostapelia or Starving Venom. Can dump a brick to the GY to make it useful again. Rarely use it to fusion a DM monster, it's usually bet to set it and use it on the opponent's turn or using it to push for lethal during the battle phase.</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1ge56hdqjq"">Traps</h3><p><strong>2x Eternal Soul: </strong>Never run this at 3, you can search it with so many effects and usually do not want it in your opening hand as you want other stuff to get a DM into the GY (or on the field) first. Running Salvation helps a lot and you can get it back off the GY if you really need with Soul Servant. Not much to do if it gets banished though.</p><p><strong>3x Infinite Impermanence:</strong> For going second and disrupting the opponent. Also handy to screw with the backrow. Can be replaced with any other handtrap or Dark Ruler No More.</p><hr /><h2 id=""mcetoc_1ge56hdqjr"">Extra Deck</h2><h3 id=""mcetoc_1ge56hdqjs"">Fusion Monsters</h3><p><strong>1x Dark Magician the Dragon Knight:</strong> Protects Eternal Soul and possibly Dark Magicial Circle, you want to fusion into this instead of Dragoon if you have both set already as this combination is insanely hard to deal with. Especially since even if your Dragon Knight is somehow sent to the GY you can just summon it back with Eternal Soul. Having this AND Dragoon out at the same time is possibly a game winning play.</p><p><strong>1x Red Eyes Dark Dragoon:</strong> The reason this deck is functioning. A very annoying and hard to deal with boss monster which you ideally want to have out on your first turn. The omni negate buff just adds insult to injury. As he is a spellcaster, he can be revived by Selene and interacts nicely with other cards like Master of Chaos, Secret Village of the Spellcasters or Rivalry.</p><p><strong>1x The Dark Magicians:</strong> Allows you to draw, brings out DMG and DM after being dealt with, very easy to fuse into and a very iconic card.</p><p><strong>1x Master of Chaos:</strong> Use DM and Illusion to get Mahad and DM, DMG or Illusion of Chaos (+ to bounce it back to hand with its own effect) special'd from the GY. Then you can tribute your just summoned monsters to banish your opponent's monsters. You can possibly retrieve the card you used to fusion summon Master or any other useful spell you need from your GY once Master is destroyed.</p><h3 id=""mcetoc_1ge56hdqjt"">Super Poly Targets</h3><p><strong>Garura &amp; Mudragon:&nbsp;</strong>The two current baseline monsters to break board with Super Poly.

While a lot of decklists just focus on drawing more extenders to spam the board with XYZs that essentially don't stop your opponent from running you over this one opts to <strong>draw into handtraps/traps</strong> instead <strong>to disrupt your opponent</strong> on their turn. Since this deck can consistently outpout their 3 XYZ monsters on the first turn (sometimes even without the normal summon) <strong>playing more extenders is simply overkill</strong> and will deplete you all of your resources while still leaving you vulnerable to succumb to your opponents wrath<br /><br />Essentially <strong>all of the handtraps/traps can be exchanged with other traps/handtraps</strong> and the deck would still function exactly the same as long as those cards replacing it fulfill the same role: protecting your board/disrupting your opponent. This last statement is relevant for budget players looking to build the deck irl, cards like Forbidden Chalice still do a great job if you can't afford the Ash's as an example, same goes for the Zeus, Exciton Knight is already a strong equalizer. The Side-Deck is also completely replacable with other blow-out cards like Raigeki and such.</p>"

But it's not meant to be used like this. The idea is actually to side into Backrow Control for game 2 or 3. Activate Card Destruction as often as you can so that your opponent fears it. Then in the next game, they will set their power spells in fear of loosing them. That's when you get the upper hand with this deck.</p>"

I wish i released this list sooner for people to use before it got banned but im going to explain why this deck was so powerful.<br /><br />This deck grinds so ridiculously well, plays through disruptions, and puts up big negates boards. Its so versatile. Even if this deck gets drnm'd the opponents still has to spend resources on building a board that break yours entire board and you make them think about which cards to destroy (Spright Elf, Toadally Awesome, Guardian, and Savage) Deck is crazy good. Tier 1 minimum but borderline Tier 0 Dupe Frog protects apollousa from being attacked during the bp (Giving you more freedom to use her negates), Being able to set spright starter for one extra negate (Can be used after being drnm'd) Toadally Awesome grabbing Cartorhyn for double normal to increase the decks grind ability Being able to re-use (prevent from being banished) cartorhyn and plaguspreader cuz they can be used to xyz summon Gigantic Spright, and Spright Elf just existing.<br /><br />For more context the ronintoadin and halq ban hurt this list the most. Halq i dont need to explain why but ronintoadin wasn't only an amazing pathway to Toadally Awesome. The follow up play during turn 3 it gave allowed you to easily make Spright Elf for further extension or Accesscode talker. Ronintoadin turn 3 with 2 frogs in gy was incredibly powerful. Also not having Toadally Awesome means not being able to grab Cartorhyn from gy for even further Turn 3 follow up. Essentially this decks ability to build a HUGE board with amazing grind is gone<br /><br />I am leaving this list here for those who just want to have fun with it or in case Halq or Ronintoadin become unbanned in the future. Do what you will with this deck list.<br /><br />EDIT: Here also a download link to all my EDOPro combo and duel replays using the deck https://www.mediafire.com/file/6mmjo2himhrb0g6/EDOPro_Spright_Adam_Combo_Replays.rar/file</p>"

Paleofrogs is one of my favorite decks and Ronintoadin getting banned kills the frog engine completely. This deck is pretty much a Dinorabbit version of Paleofrogs based off of how I used to play Paleofrogs and how Dzeeff used Rescue Rabbit in his Paleofrog list he made in a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The main deck is the usual Paleofrog deck I play just with 3 Rescue Rabbit and a 3rd Unexpected Dai and it is on Lord of the Heavenly Prison. I did change the extra a bit, but dont think that it is correct yet as the frog engine being gone changes so much, so I will be changing it again at some point. Marincess Coral Anemone and Accesscode Talker for example might not be fit for this deck anymore as it will be much harder to create the materials now.&nbsp;</p><p>Any help or feedback is welcome, as I want to work towards finding the new way to play ""Paleofrogs"".&nbsp;</p><p>o7 to both Frog the Jam and Ronintoadin.</p>"

Its effect in the graveyard, combined with Intruder, means that you can very abruptly put up a wall of 3-4 FLIP monsters with sticky effects.

There is not a lot of Silent rep in this deck because I wanted to show off the lesser seen Gadgets and Magnet Warriors but you can add more Silent if you want.

Demon angels cool</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Does it work?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To a degree, yes. Fabled lacks a powerful boss monster, which Raviel (kinda) provides.&nbsp;Each archtype has several cards that have discard related effects, and so they can be used in tandem with each other to prepare for specific setups. Outside of discarding and graveyard related effects, you're essentially playing two different games at once. Fabled is going to shoot for synchros while your Sacred Beast monsters are going to try to bring Raviel out. &nbsp;Depending on the hand you may only go for one first, and then potentially draw into the next one later. Fallen Paradise combined with Fabled Ragin means that your always going to be able to draw two more cards regardless of where you start. Shooting for negates is really what Fabled is going to be aiming for here. Herald, F.A. Dragster, and maybe even Baronne are your eventual targets. Herald in particular can be easy seeing how you'll often have a leftover level 2 monster in Dark Beckoning Beast.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What About That Extra Deck?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Herald and F.A. for easy negates, linkuriboh for the occasional leftover level 1 monster, Brionac for non-destruction card removal (and discards), Chaos Ruler, and Baronne for some more boss monsters. Fabled Andwraith can force your opponent to dump a monster (if they don't read or if they only have monsters left in their hand), at worst acting as fodder for Raviel to get an attack boost, as best causing a discard on your way to a level 8 synchro. T.G. Hyper Liberian is there on the possiblity that you could get off tons of synchros, but it's honestly rarely feasible. I put cupid pitch at 2 precicely cuz it can be so hard to get to the higher level synchros, especially when you haven't yet gotten a huge card advantage. Levithan is just there to collect space tbh. Cool looking card, that's pretty much it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What about that side deck?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not a serious side deck, but some extra cards that seemed fun in theory but didn't make the cut due to consistency issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anything else I should know?<br /></strong></p><p>The numbers on some cards isn't totally set in stone yet. I'm not super excited to have Raviel at 3 (two copies in a starting hand is a nightmare) but having him in your initial hand can save you a lot of headaches. Ash was originally at 3 but it can cause some issues when your trying to deplete your hand for Fabled Ragin. You can't really run any hand traps at all in this deck because of that.</p>"

You could play 3, but you really dont want to be drawing it. You could also play at 1, which is the more common choice, but I found that I was always wanting both the search and the negate.

Its very consistent and makes use of Guardian Chimera very effectively as well as being able to set up for next turn during you opponents turn (searching for another Branded Fusion, mills of Kitkalos and Kaleido, resets with Tragedy). Its also cheaper than the Danger variant and stronger than the pure variant.</p>"

Summon one Chaos Dragon -&gt; summon Striker Dragon -&gt; Search the other Chaos Dragon -&gt; Banish the Chaos Dragon in the GY to Special Summon -&gt; If you used Chaos Space to search these dragons, banish Chaos Space for 1 draw -&gt; Summon Cross-Sheep or another link monster of choice!</li><li><u>Cross-Sheep + Titan/Colossus:</u>&nbsp;Fusion or special summon a Titan/Colossus to a zone Cross-Sheep points to summon another card from the GY. Depending on your situation, make Apollousa with multiple negates or Accesscode with 2+ pops!</li><li><u>Aloof Lupine + Thunder Dragon = Cross Sheep -&gt; Apollousa/Titan:</u> Normal summon Aloof Lupine -&gt; Banish Thunder Dragon in hand and Thunder Dragonroar in deck -&gt; Dragonroar eff to summon Thunder Dragondark from deck -&gt; Link off Lupine + Dragondark for Cross-Sheep -&gt; Dragondark eff to search Thunder Dragon Fusion -&gt; Thunder Dragon Fusion eff to summon Titan to a zone Cross-Sheep points to -&gt; Cross-Sheep effect to summon from GY Aloof Lupine -&gt; Link off Cross-Sheep + Aloof Lupine + 1+ more monster(s) for 3-4 negate Apollousa.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Dangers! cards:</u>&nbsp;If you have lots of Danger! monsters in your hand, think about the chance of summoning them with the likelihood of discarding particular cards in your hand. If there is a valuable spell card you do not want to discard in your hand (like Monster Reborn or Thunder Dragon Fusion) be sure to set it first. Also, the OG Thunder Dragon can stock up your hand with 2 more cards so that the Danger! cards have more chance to successfully resolve and summon themselves with the +1 draw.</li><li><u>Draw cards and thinning out your deck:</u>&nbsp;If you have a card/play that draws or digs in your deck, be sure to search as much as possible first. Search with Chaos Space, Thunder Dragons, Emergency Teleports first before summoning Chaos Ruler or using Pot of Desires!&nbsp;</li><li><u>2 Level 8s = Hope Harbinger/4 Material Zeus:</u> If you have easy access to two level 8s, you can access to Rank 8 toolbox this deck offers. Going first, Hope Harbinger can be summoned with Numeron Dragon for a spell negate and two beefy bodies on board. Going second, Dingirsu -&gt; Pain Gainer -&gt; Zeus can be made for 1 non-targeting send and 2 fieldwipes as follow-up.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Normal Summon:</u> If you look closely at this deck, this deck only has 2 dedicated normal summons - 2 Aloof Lupines. That is because normal summons are typically saved for the Thunder Dragon monsters, since they all require only 1 tribute. Tributes for your summons are easy to obtain, since almost every monster special summons in this deck.&nbsp; After you summon the Thunder Dragon monster, you can tribute it to special summon Colossus, given you used a thunder monster's effect in the hand that turn.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Thunder Dragon Fusion in GY:</u> In turn 3+, Thunder Dragon Fusion is your follow-up play. It normally searches Thunder Dragonroar so you can recycle Thunder Dragon Fusion to summon another Titan. It can also search Chaos Creator, which can further summon from the banished pile and trigger more banish effects from your GY!</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><div class=""x_elementToProof""><span><span>Remember, the optimal endboard this deck can make going first is 3-4 negate Apollousa, a Titan with multiple pops, a Colossus to lock searching and a Hope Harbinger for a spell negate. That's usually enough to stop all your opponent's plays or have them instantly concede.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><span><span>Going second, this deck can easily make 8000+ attack on board and with multiple removals with Titan/Accesscode. While achieving gamestate, Chaos Thunderdragon should be able to shrug off most interruption - except floodgates.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><p class=""x_MsoNormal"">Want to see the deck in action?

Try to fish and bait for your opponent's interruptions before truly committing to your big plays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>If you want to focus more on destroying multiple backrow, creating Thunder Dragon Titan is the ideal play, since it can pop cards on the field multiple times without targeting and can survive being destroyed multiple times (for ex. Torrential Tribute or Conquistador of the Golden Land).</li></ul><ul><li>Since this deck lacks an inherent normal summons and doesn&rsquo;t really set cards, Denko Sekka can be decent budget option for the backrow decks you will face. She is also searchable off Thunder Dragon Fusion!</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>This deck is particularly weak to backrow, floodgates and high impact handtraps like Nibiru, Maxx ""C"", and Droll &amp; Lockbird.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>Thunder Dragon Colossus is an extremely hard to kill instant-win button vs. common decks Flundereeze and heavily cripples decks like Branded Despia. If all your other plays have been stopped, at least try to get this purple menace out!&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>Chaos Thunderdragon doesn't have an obvious ""chokepoint"" where a well-timed handtrap/interruption can end your turn. This deck slices through low-impact handtraps like nothing!&nbsp;</li></ul><span><strong><br aria-hidden=""true"" /><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span><br aria-hidden=""true"" /><br aria-hidden=""true"" /></strong></span></div><div class=""x_elementToProof""><span><strong><span>The synergy between Thunder Dragons, Chaos and Danger! almost seem like these three archetypes were designed to support each other! Thunder Dragons maintain hand advantage serving as discard fodder for Danger! cards as well as GY set-up for Chaos cards! Danger! allows free bodies on board with +1 draws while setting up the GY for Chaos cards we well!

Colossus is a true powerhouse threat that shuts down many decks and avenues of play. A nice little bonus is the beautiful animation of this beauty everytime you summon Colossus and Titan - which is often the last thing your opponent will see before they surrender or get obliterated!<br aria-hidden=""true"" /><br aria-hidden=""true"" />GLHF Duelists!</span></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

There are no synchros due to the deck being based off the DM era continuity. Cards in the side deck like Grinning Grave Virus and Loop of Destruction are examples of how I built this deck. Grinning Grave Virus from Crush Card Virus and Loop of Destruction from Ring of Destruction. No Fang of Critias because he no longer owned it after the Waking The Dragons arc.

This is a fun casual deck i made from scratch by myself, so its probly not as optimal as it can be but its still fun as is.</p><p>The Deck is a fun and casual deck however it does have some anti meta shenanigans going for it. Going first without getting handtrapped againts a meta deck, you could set up a board to kill any graveyard effects and stop a dark ruler no more!.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck is very cheap without the imperms, Infact im not a fan of the imperms as it slows the deck down alot. But i just put it here to fill the deck.</p><p>Deck Combo and starters:</p><p>1.) Magikey World: ALLWAYS DO THIS 1ST! This is a one card starter to get the magikeys going. If this resolves, search for Magikey Batobuster. Then use Magikey worlds 2nd effect to search for Magikey Maftea. You should have a normal monster in hand, hopefully, normal or special summon a normal monster to the field and then summon batobuster using Magikey Maftea. If you have a normal monster on the field, Magikey maftea allows you to use a normal monster from the deck as a material. ALWAYS TRY AND KEEP THE DOLLS EQUAL IN THE DECK eg: 2 madchens and 2 bear bears. On summon of batobuster you are allowed to search for ANY Magkiey card. We will search for Maginificent Magikey Mafteal and activate his effect to normal summon a magikey monster in addition to your normal summon. Doing this allows you to special summon a normal monster from the grave (the monster we used as a material) Your field should consist of 4 monsters now, make Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine and Exosister Mikailis. Use mikailis to search for Exosister arment and Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine to set a Magikey unlocking straight from the deck. With this,. your board consists of any exosister you need from the extra deck a spell/trap negate and a destroy on summon, all this off of magikey world!</p><p>2.) Doll Happiness : This is allways the last starter you use as it locks you into xyz (You cant use&nbsp;Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine) On activation; search for grandpa dimedo or Box of friends. To set up a field, get box of friends. Doll happiness second effect is to destroy a card on the field or hand to send a doll from deck to grave. Destroy the box of friends and send a doll from deck to grave ( Keep the dolls equal in the deck!). Box of friends effect then activates to special summon 2 monsters with different names that either have 0 atk or def from the deck( If you used magikey world before using Doll happiness, make sure to use a different doll monster than the one you used for the batobuster material. THIS WILL KEEP THE DOLLS AT 2 in the deck. allowing more plays in the future). XYZ into the princess Cologne. This is already a lock by it self (read cologne and Doll happiness effects)</p><p>These are your 2 main starters and can be played with each other amongts other plays to set up a decently nasty field.&nbsp;</p><p>Have fun playing the deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

See, I've been out of the game for a long while but when I did play Red-Eyes was always my favorite card. Well, one day a guy I work with was talking my ear off about Yu-Gi-Oh and so I started feeling like I might revive my old and forgotten dragon deck. After learning about Goat Format I thought I'd give it a go and rebuild my deck for the fun of it and a chance to play again like the old days. The main focus of the deck is of course Red-Eyes and getting them out and powering them up while having ways to stall and trip up my opponent. And if possible to swap in the Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon as a really big beat stick. All while working on a shoe string budget for a deck of cards that probably won't see a lot of play outside of a cassual game here and there.&nbsp;</p>"

I am at heart a pendulum player.</p><p>odd-eyes revolution dragon as a great light target, the discard to search is not once per turn and helps set the graveyard</p><p>rokket dragon destruction effect triggers odd-eyes arc pendulum in scale to summon any odd-eyes monster from hand, deck and graveyard, this is great for extension, it can grab performapal odd-eyes synchron a level 2 tuner, performapal odd-eyes dissolver a monster polymerisation, or odd-eyes persona an effect veiler to extra deck monsters.</p><p>performapal odd-eyes synchron, in scale can turn every odd-eyes monster into a level 1 tuner, as a monster is can special summon one of your pendulum cards in scale and synchro immediately, giving access to baronne de fleur using odd-eyes dissolver, or odd-eyes meteor dragon using odd-eyes persona in scale. In a pinch aether and amophage sloth can be used to give you access to the magical dragon for more milling, or borreload savage to protect yourself while building a board.</p><p>Performapal odd-eyes dissolver give you access to fusion monster, odd-eyes vortex is an omni negate once per turn, but can also break board as when it is special summoned it can shuffle an face-up attack monster into players hand, trick monsters like mirrorjade won't get the boardwipe effect. When summon correctly odd-eyes arc pendulum, can summon odd-eyes vortex again on destruction from grave triggering it shuffle effect. Borreload furious seem look an odd pick in the build, however you may not have the pendulum monsters on board from odd-eyes vortex, furious dragon will still provide disruption and again the destruction of odd-eyes card trigger can summon persona from deck for a negate.&nbsp;</p><p>supreme king dragon package, provide one the normal summon, giving you access to low scales to odd-eyes arc pendulum dragon high (8), the foolish burial and dragon shrine of darkwurm is a free summon and search. Dragon shrine can also foolish an odd-eyes arc pendulum as an extra, thinning the deck and setting up graveyard with dark. Gate zero is actually not your best low scale, that go to odd-eyes persona, it actually the monster effect, destroying itself and odd-eyes card trigger odd-eyes arc pendulum, while summoning a fusion, or syncho dragon, your targets are furious dragon and dragonshell, bare in mind there effect are negated and they have 0 atk/def, what we are after in the graveyard effect, furious dragon allows you to special summon borrelend from grave if your opponent managed to out it, and dragonshell while it can be synchro summoned to recycle borreload savage, magical dragon and baronne, it can equip itself to a monster summoned from the extra deck, on attack declaration allow you to draw a card.</p><p>aether and amorphage sloth are your seal targets, aether can banish a monster on special summon, goes to the extra deck and can be pendulum summoned again. Sloth is the side deck alternative, it is big enough to attack over winda when pendulum summoned, but when you have been dark rulered, your can still trigger seal, as it tribute is cost summon sloth preventing your opponent from FTK.</p><p>the rest of the deck is just the dragon-link core goodness.</p><p>the pendulum best synagy is with rokket tracer and boot sector launch. boot on field is broken for follow up plays, and there is just so much value keeping it on field, and there are times when i used seal to return boot to hand so i could have the followup play. The pendulum monster in scale are great being you face card target for rokket tracer to extend with.</p><p>less optimium play result in seal pass, pendulum heavy hand seal pass with vortex, most of your play will end on borrelend and hot red, but the followup in graveyard and extra deck&nbsp;</p><p>the hand trap is as you like for your locals, as is you side deck i choose veiler over infinite because it a light target. The cosmic are for anti-spell fragrance, and mystic mine can be dealt with by spiral flame strike, a non once per turn rota and pop when an odd-eyes card is on the field, whether as a monster or in scales.</p><p>This month has been difficult with this architype, as pendulum is just not in the best place, but in term of dragon-link it does rise the floor and ceiling by involving another summoning mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p>So please have fun and tell me would you think.</p><p>Pend best deck!!!</p>"

The nimble engine also helps Spright's grind game as Nimble Beaver also summons from grave. Not only this, Nimble Angler also helps against Ishizu Tear with how much they mill, it gets Spright bodies on board before their turn even starts, forcing the Ishizu Tear player to spend resources to destroy them otherwise you will pop off</p><p>I am using the Adventurer engine as it not only is a strong negate which Spright loves to have but can also act as Swap Frog fodder from hand (if you have Enchantress in hand) and this deck doesn't need its normal so Rite of Aramesir's restriction is mostly negligable.</p><p>In the side deck is a Cyber-Stein and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. Spright Sprind can send the Stein from deck to grave and Spright Elf can summon it back so you can summon your Dragoon without running a brick (except Stein itself). Dragoon does NOT gain its destruction effect, only the negation effect but i think its more than enough. Other options you can run include DPE, Exterio, Last Warrior From Another Planet and any others you want to try</p>"

I'm coming around on the combination!,"<p>This is a second take on a Krawler Tindangle list. My first build can be found <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/krawler-tindangle-303090"">here</a>, and as you can see I was less than hopeful on the archetypes' potential synergies. I've revisited the deck, however, and I think I've found a build that's a lot more synergistic and consistent! I've trimmed the list to 42 cards and removed the draw cards. They help the deck's consistency an incredible amount, but we need to keep as many of our names in rotation as possible (either for Soma's summons, or making Acute Cerberus). The current build of this deck aims to flood the field with flip-monsters that float into other bodies so that on our following turn we can link off into game winners like Unchained Abomination and Accesscode Talker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is meant to highlight Tindangles, so we are including enough bodies and cards to reliably make Acute Cerberus. We are on 2 Base Gardna to increase our chances of milling it, as we need it to make Acute Cerb. The Dholes and Deluanay are also at 2 to increase the mill odds, and we can discard all of these cards with Barricadeborg Blocker if need be. We play Survivor at 3 to give us a good mill engine, and Jhrelth at 3 to send from hand and deck. Small world is crucial for finding our combo pieces, and our main bridges are Guard Dog, who can be used to shut down the opponent for a turn, and Chronomaly Colossal Head, who can flip the opponent's monsters or our own. The Krawler engine is 3 Soma, 2 Dendrite, and 1 Glial, with 3 Girsu to support them. We send Mind Meld to GY off of Girsu, then set Pawns after making Lib. Nibiru is our main source of disruption for the opponent, and Lord of the Heavenly Prison to protect our face-downs. Since we are on 3 Survivor, we are playing a Link-heavy extra deck. We use it to toolbox our way out of difficult scenarios and push for game once we've build a strong enough board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I won't re-tread the combos and Small World bridges in this decklist, but I want to emphasize that this deck wants to win on turn 3-4. Our main goal is to live long enough to take advantage of our recursive summoning and floating bodies. This deck doesn't break boards very well, and doesn't make unbreakable boards, but if we go first we can set up Winda, and if we go second we can use Sol and Luna to help us set and activate our flip-monsters. If you would like a more detailed deck description or lines of play, please leave a comment down below! I'm happy to provide more info on any aspects of the deck, and am open to suggestions for this or other decks! Thanks for reading, and I hope your day goes well!</p>"

Throw out your Extra Deck so your opponent will literally throw out theirs!","<p>Deck Details and Tips</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The key focus of this deck is utilizing your extra deck as tribute fodder for ritual summons. To this end, Shaddols are utilized as an optional lock play, while the Fossils, and Elder Entity are to be used explictly as secondary removal. The Herald and Albaz cards are secondary card advantage for you to further your plays, but are to be viewed as secondary options to the control choices. The level 9 and 10 cards are solely present to be used to multisummon your nekroz ritual monsters, but they are otherwise wholly unimportant to the deck. If you are forced to remove cards from your extra deck by an opponent's effect, these should be the first choice.&nbsp;</p><p>The Impcantation engine is present solely as a back up search options in the case where you did not draw any of the nekroz pieces. They are not important to your deck's function and should be viewed as wholly disposable in cases where your engine is online.&nbsp;<br /><br />The dogmatika ritual monsters are your closer of choice in most games, while also being decent disruption against extra deck combo decks (Fallen of Albaz, Despia, Syncron, etc.). The non ritual engine is a powerful control secondary option in cases where you can not ritual summon, or your running out of steam in a longer game. Use the non ritual cards present to stifle opponent's plays while moving to close out the game.&nbsp;<br /><br />The most important part of the deck, the Nekroz are present largely to enable you to play Nekroz of Unicore, which is fundamentally a core wincon to your list. If you have Unicore out turn 1, your should have little to no problem outplaying and outvaluing most decks. Brionac is your secondary choice, especially in a go-second state, as he will be very effecient in removal and in baiting out your opponent's negate options.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lastly, the finishing touch of the deck is the Shaddol Schism. First and foremost, this is always a garnet if it is drawn first turn. This card is best when searched using Shaddol Apkallone as a ritual material, as it will enable you to fusion summon into Shaddol Winda during the opponents turn, giving you a powerful board into their turn.&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p><br />Weaknesses</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck suffers to Kaijus, it can not really outplay it, as the endboard will often be 1-2 creatures that act as floodgates.&nbsp;<br />It lacks any real way to deal with Floowanderize, and will be completely stifled against them. The same can be said for Monarch decks.</p><p>Due to the removal being largely creature based, skill drain is a very serious issue for this deck to play around, it is possible but not something you can reasonably deal with on the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to not having any form of Link summoning in this list, some more obscure forms of control, Iblee for example, will be incredible hard to deal with.</p><p>Lastly, Helios type effects that banish the gy will restrict your options for extending plays, but should be reasonably playable regardless.&nbsp;</p><p>-----</p><p>Strengths</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When going first you can easily cripple Despia decks.</p><p>Synchro decks that rely on key cards in the extra deck will be heavily limited in their options.&nbsp;</p><p>The information you can have over the opponent will give you significant advantage in choosing your follow ups.&nbsp;</p><p>Link Climbing decks will be heavily limited in their ability to build an end board.&nbsp;</p><p>It is very effective at rebuilding boards after being removed, and has access to a multitude of gy effects that will give you advantage against heavy removal based control decks.&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is heavily augmentable to fit floodgates, as there are 3 engines present, you can easily change ratios to add in There Can Only Be One, Gozen Match, Summon Limit, or And The Band Played On, depending on your needs.&nbsp;</p>"

I'm back with another deck in a series where I try to make as many Krawler builds as I can, mixing archetypes and splashing engines to come up with creative and interesting combos! This build is similar to my last one (Spright/Krawler), but it uses the Runick engine to ensure access to Lv 2 mons, as well as providing several removal and counter-play tools. This build was one inspired by a user's deck from the Krawler Discord, but with a few additions and a few removals. I'll be going over the pros and cons of the cards in this deck, an explanation of the ratios, and a short combo guide down below. I appreciate you taking the time to read this!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck has 3 basic cores. The Krawler core (including Girsu) uses our normal summon and can get us to Utopic Draco Future, Winda, and/or a set Deus X-Krawler (note: I'm not currently playing Winda, but you can, and I have included the package in the Side Deck). Girsu is a very juicy target for Ash Blossom, but if they get Ash'd, we can still combo off if we have Soma, a Spright, and/or a Runick card in hand. Krawlers have great recursability and let us continue to make plays regardless of how long the game goes. Sprights need no introduction, but I'll just quickly say that their Extra Deck recursion and Main Deck removal and counter options are a welcome thing in most decks that can run them. Runicks are being used here not for their notorious deck-out potential, but rather for their removal, destruction, and ability to summon a Lv 2 Extra Deck monster! Any Runick card plus any Spright combo-starter lets us pop fully off!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I won't go over the basic choices in this deck like the individual Krawlers or Runick cards, as they are fairly standard. For Sprights, I have chosen to run 3 Jets and 2 Starters. Normally this ratio might be reversed, or run at 3 a-piece, but I've found that Starter has limited uses after the first two turns, and it is a hard once-per-turn, so drawing 2 often feels bad. The higher number of Jets is to give us more Lv 2 special-summonable bodies for our combo lines. We are on 2 Survivor and 2 Small World. Survivor locks us into Link monsters, and is usually only usable at the end of a combo, but it does fill the GY with Runick spells that we can then shuffle back with Runick Fountain, and it can get Mind Meld into the GY. Small World is an amazing draw for this deck when we often want to see both Girsu and Soma in our opening hands, but it is also a hard once-per-turn. We run 3 Mind Meld, as we can mill it, send it to GY with Girsu, or discard it with Hugin's effect. I'm running the Ghostrick / UDF engine in this deck, but you could take it out to focus more on Link monsters and up the Survivor count to 3. I'm only on 2 Runick Fountain as it is searchable off of any Runick spell, but playing it at 3 is a very strong option, too, as drawing it and any Runick spell lets us start digging for cards. We are running 2 Spright Smashers to counter Mystic Mine and floodgates, but this can be sided for better options depending on the matchup. I would love to run Dharc and Qualiark, but I simply did not have room in the Extra Deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now for some combos!</p><p>Cards in hand: combo description</p><p>Basic Combos-</p><p>Girsu: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld to the GY. Summon a token to both fields, then link off for Lib, using Lib to set Pawns from deck. Use Mind Meld in Gy to summon Deus X to the zone Lib points to.</p><p>Soma and a monster: Normal the monster, special Soma by flipping the monster face-down. Summon 2 Krawlers, one face-up the other face-down. Use both face-up monsters to make Socuteboss, overlay for Angel of Mischief.

This is my first deck i truly built by myself. Another thing, sorry about all the rank-up-magics, i was worried about this possibly creating a lot of bricks but surpisingly most of the time it's no problem. You may get unlucky though. Rank-up-magics are CRUCIAL to the deck too.</p><p>(Personal note: SHA is the best rank 4 in the deck, bring it out when you can. :))</p>"

Despite these two not being however nothing has changed at all for Sprights. Implications of new and old staples also shape the deck quite a bit for my liking (Especially Dark Ruler No More now being a thing). Also I never Knew Illegal Knight would be just as good as Gryphon Rider, but with no negates (only softcore removal).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;However the only mistake I made here was not going for Pot of Prosperity over Triple Tactics Talent (despite both having their benefits). Also liked the addition of Super Polymerization; but only maybe I'm not playing against ""Tearlaments, Branded, HEROs, etc."". Besides these two thoughts; I overall liked the outcome of what I made, and pretty much was surprised on what it can do despite two losses that were the ""supposed backbone"" of both Sprights and the Adventurer package.</p>"
