Virtual World extra deck monster.  try to change some cards that fit your playsty","even if this deck has 50 cards on it, this deck is still consistent. this deck trying to combine some level 3 monster that has Psychic-type. myuta has level 3 baby with psychic-type and myutant can play when the baby is on hand to connect the level 8 monster + 1 myutant spell/trap, and myutant field spell on hand, you still can do PUNK. combo :) the level 8 myutant can be a dead card so you can discard it for another card effect that needs to discard/banish 1 card from hand. some other level-3 with psychic can support the PUNK archetype fine because PUNK boss monster (the synchro lv 11) can shuffle as many cards as the level 3 psychic on the GY. I use Overdrive Teleporter because he can provide some good extender combo and instant level 9 synchro, but you must normal summon him. for the extra deck monster I use myutant because they are good boss monster, virtual world extra deck monster card can be a good control card and some psychic extra deck monster like the new level 11 psychic boss monster :) and there some rank 3 xyz if you cannot synchro or fusion. Leviair the Sea Dragon can recycle the banished monster and reuse the effect like NyanNyan. the side deck contain some card that can be helpful too depending on your playing style. Lava Golem can help kill the unkillable monster too :)

for starter hand if you have the more than 1 level 3 monster/punk monsters or 1 punk monster that can summon another PUNK monster (in this case the level 8 PUNK or Noh PUNK Seamin) you can start your combo. (but if only Noh PUNK Seamin on hand and no other monster, your best monster for that turn are just 1 of the lv 8 I'm afraid or you can search for Noh PUNK Foxy Tune(the white lv 8) to special summon 1 level 3 punk and do xyz, or you have other alternative depend on the situation but still 1 seamin still better than 1 other level 3 punk :) Overdrive Teleporter can be a good combo extender try to call 2 card that you need (maybe Noh PUNK Seamin and the baby myutant or other 2 monsters depending on your situation) and try to access the level 9 synchro if you want or another type of board that you want :)

sadly I think this deck need more recycler like psychic overload/pot series. but still, a deck with 50 cards on it can still repeat the combo 1-4 times before run out of resource and some extra deck monster like Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen and Psy-framelord omega can do some little bit recycle with NyanNyan :)"

This deck has a nice toolbox of Monsters and Spells, all easily accessible and recyclable, allowing you to outplay and outpace countless other strategies with proper play and a bit of luck.

Thanks to the release of the new Fusion Monster Witchcrafter Vice-Master the deck has gotten a much stronger end-boss and a much higher ceiling. As such, it only makes sense to aim to put her onto the field ASAP, and this build tries to do just that. Cards like Magicians' Souls and Magician's Restage, which were previously clunky and unnecessary, are now powerful extenders for producing Predaplant Verte Anaconda. Combined with Magicalized Fusion, this makes it extremely easy to get out Vice-Master turn 1 and get the ball rolling. Generic spellcaster Link-1s make link-climbing even easier, and the nearly entirely spellcaster Extra Deck synergizes extremely well with Vice-Master to allow for some disgusting turn 3+ plays, especially as the typing in this deck allows you to make every Charmer link, as well as Selene , Queen of the Master Magicians (who can also be used to reborn/trigger Vice-Master as a quick-effect). Furthermore, nearly every extra deck monster can be recycled with Patronus, allowing you to easily manipulate the board state turn after turn.

My ratios and reasoning are as follows:


<strong>3x Witchcrafter Schmietta: </strong>Hands-down the best of the starters both in statline and effect. Vice-Master allows you to get creative with your plays involving Schmietta, as you can often mill a card and then quickly add it to your hand to be used (such as Patronus)
<strong>3x Witchcrafter Genni: </strong>Not quite as good as Schmietta, but she has enough utility that I run her at 3. She's the best way of accessing Golem Aruru early on, and can allow you to play through interruptions depending on your hand, but she can occasionally be dead with nothing to copy. You could easily cut her to 2 or even 1, but I've so far liked having a decent number of starters to work with.
<strong>2x Witchcrafter Pittore: </strong>She can help cycle dead cards out of your hand, but generally she's just worse than the previous two. I run 2 just to keep up the number of names in the deck, but you could easily play 1-0.
<strong>1x Witchcrafter Potterie: </strong>Deceptively powerful in the right situations, Potterie helps keep cards in your hand and enables comeback plays if you ever end up in a situation where you're stuck topdecking. That being said, I would probably never play more than 1 as she's typically only good past turn 1.
<strong>1x each of Witchcrafter Golem Aruru, Madame Verre, Haine and Edel: </strong>The big bosses are all huge bricks and as such should never be ran at anything higher than 1. You can access them all extremely easily, recycle them from nearly anywhere, and Vice-Master gives you an Extra Deck boss in case you somehow lose them all. Of these, Edel is the worst and is usually only good in corner cases where you draw into the other bosses, but her being summonable off of Vice-Master does allow for some interesting plays.
<strong>3x Magicians' Souls: </strong>While Souls used to be mostly pointless to run, it now serves as an extremely efficient card for setting up a fusion of Vice-Master off of Magicalized Fusion and can be used as an extender to make Verte. Furthermore, Souls cycles spells out of your hand to dig deeper into your deck, and in combination with Magician's Restage allows you to generate a ton of resources early on (as you can summon Souls, link it off, activate Restage, revive Souls, then use Souls to send Restage and draw + get the search off of Restage and make Verte for Vice-Master). I would certainly not drop this anymore, and have even considered playing the new Dark Magician Ritual Monster (Illusion of Chaos) to search it.

<strong>3x Witchcrafter Creation, Holiday and Unveiling: </strong>Creation gets you your monsters, Holiday is your best extender through disruptions, and Unveiling makes your cards unrespondable for a turn. Ratios of the spells are somewhat flexible but I wouldn't cut more than 1-2 between Holiday and Unveiling.
<strong>1x Witchcrafter Draping, Collaboration, Bystreet, Scroll and Confusion: </strong>The ""bad"" spells, all ran at 1. Each one has its use and serves as another name in the deck, but you can afford to cut these down if you want more room. Scroll and Collaboration are especially niche and tend to be winmore when actually using them beyond discard fodder, but Draping, Bystreet and Confusion are all solid enough to warrant running them at 1.
<strong>3x Magicalized Fusion: </strong>In combination with any starter, Magicalized Fusion cheats out Vice-Master and gets your gameplan moving. All of the level 4 or lower Witchcrafters can be linked off for Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden, giving you the required materials for Vice-Master instantly. Furthermore, it can easily be sent off of Verte Anaconda at basically any point to give you a secondary way of accessing Vice-Master if your plays get interrupted. I would run at least the 1, but since opening it is ideal, I personally play 3.
<strong>3x Magician's Restage + 1 each of Magician's Left/Right Hand: </strong>Restage is just another extender/recovery option, much like Holiday, but can also be traded out for a decent floodgate in the form of the Left/Right Hands. If nothing else, Restage is the best discard fodder in the deck, and enables some nice plays with Magicians' Souls. To make things even better, neither effect is a HOPT, so opening multiple is rarely an issue. I play 3/1/1, but you could play around with the ratios if you so choose.
<strong>2x Witchcrafter Patronus: </strong>The only Trap in the deck, Patronus allows you to cycle resources and keep spells in your hand in the grind game. As Vice-Master can recover it from the GY, it is now ""searchable"" off of Schmietta/Vice-Master and as such I only play the 2 copies (1 to use and 1 as a backup/for the banish effect), but you could easily play 3 or 1 depending on your preference.

<strong>2x Witchcrafter Vice-Master</strong><strong>: </strong><em>The</em> boss monster of the deck, Vice-Master is everything you could ever want and more. She raises the ceiling of your end board, gives you more disruption, keeps monsters on your field and cards in your hand. All 3 of her effects are good, she's easy to make and can be revived/recycled as required. I play 2 as sometimes it's easier to summon a new one than to recycle an old one, but you could get away with 1 copy if you desired.
<strong>1x Relinquished Anima and Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden: </strong>Both link 1s serve as a way of getting Witchcrafters/Magicians' Souls into the GY for their effects, to be revived to extend into Verte, or to be used with Magicalized Fusion. Furthermore, these allow you to easily go into Lyna/Dharc using the small Witchcrafters on turn 3+ to push for lethal with Selene + Accesscode Talker.
<strong>1x Verte Anaconda: </strong>The easiest way to make Vice-Master, and a nice backup option after your plays get interrupted. Easy to make and typically only needed once, so I play just the 1 copy.
<strong>1x of Hiita, Wynn, Eria, Aussa, Lyna and Dharc (the Charmer Links): </strong>As this deck has a member of each attribute, you can make any of these depending on what you need at any given moment. Their spellcaster typing also means that they trigger Vice-Master and can be recycled with Patronus, not to mention that they all ladder into Selene using the stolen monster they summon. I like having one of each of them, but feel free to cut the ones you need less if you find yourself wanting more room.
<strong>1x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians: </strong>Selene is an absolutely insane card in this deck, allowing for all sorts of weird plays once your engine has been established. She triggers Vice-Master as a quick-effect, can summon any Witchcrafter from hand/GY, and can be recycled with Patronus. The high Spell count of the deck means she'll almost always have a good number of Spell Counters on summon. Selene also enables an exact lethal OTK by making a 5300 ATK Accesscode Talker + the 2700 ATK Vice-Master, and this can be done extremely easily using the Charmer links.
<strong>1x Knightmare Unicorn, Accesscode Talker and Underworld Goddess of the Closed World: </strong>The utility links. Knightmare Unicorn is for niche cases where you need a non-destructive removal option quickly, Accesscode is for breaking boards and pushing for game, and Underworld Goddess is for outing problematic monsters (Dragoon, The Arrival Cyberse, an I:P-boosted Avramax, etc.). All 3 of these are easily accessed thanks to the Charmer links and Vice-Master, which allow you to amass a surprisingly high number of bodies (hence the inclusion of Underworld Goddess).

(The side deck is fairly experimental. I've found that removal like Evenly and Kaijus tends to be better than other board breakers, but I'm on the fence about cards like Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Lava Golem as they can occasionally be useless/harmful)"

Battle Royal Mode - Joining),"

I'm not gonna lie, when the Spell ""Battle Royal Mode - Joining"" was revealed, I was genuinely at a loss on how to use it. The card is casual trash, but I still wanted to think of SOME way to play it well! So after a morning energy drink and some sunny-side up eggs, I had my light bulb moment: I was gonna use it in Trains! I named this particular deck ""PAIN TRAIN"" after the song ""Here Comes The Pain Train"" by Jay Harper.

&nbsp;

See, Juggernaut Liebe can attack monsters 1 more time for each Xyz Material it has, which means you can target your opponent's Effect Monster with Battle Royal Mode - Joining, so that it has to battle 3 times before it can be destroyed. Liebe can then attack it at least twice (and even use its other effect to increase its ATK to 6000 beforehand) to OTK the opponent!

&nbsp;

Because Trains is an unga bunga Deck, you want to go second 110% of the time. I also put a bunch of hand traps, 3 Dark Ruler, and Lightning Storm in the Side Deck in case you are facing a stronger, more competitive Deck."

The ones i used are pretty much just examples and you can switch them out with anything (same with the Side). Though i would definitely recommend using Halqifibrax, since Synthess can copy the effect of the Tuner you summon with it and Rocks, since getting back a Symphonic Warrior from the Extra can help alot with extending your combos and it can profit off the Level increase Effect of Basses. In addition to that Stardust Warrior can also be helpful, since it can summon a (face-down) Warrior Rocks, when it leaves the Field (main reason i used 2 copies of Rocks here). You can summon Stardust Warrior relatively easy with any level 7 Synchro plus Halqifibrax tagging into Shooting Riser and sending a Level 4 to the Grave (mainly Synthess to have another free Summon on your next turn). Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider can also be Summoned pretty easily, because most Synchros i used and all the Symphonic Warriors are Wind (Speedroids in general work well with Symphonic Warriors. So do Windwitches and Dragunity.). Virtual World Kyubi can also reset Synthess to use it again (only the Pendulum Symphonic Warriors have hard once per turn Effects). Now to the combos. They can be both very linear and also not. With Deejays/Guitaar to Summon Deejays and Stardust Synchron/Stardust Illumination to mill Synchron in Hand you can directly Summon Majestic Star Dragon or Shooting Majestic Star Dragon (you need Illumination in your Grave to Summon Shooting Majestic Star).
<blockquote><div>Summon Deejays and Summon another Monster with it's Effect

Tribute the seccond Monster with Synchron's Effect

search Arrive in Light, activate it and place Converging Wills Dragon on your Deck

Tune Deejays with Synchron for Stardust Dragon, Draw the Dragon and Summon it and Brotaur from your Deck with it's Effect

(optional) Discard 1 for Brotaur's Effect and Target Stardust to search Arma Gram for another Beater and a Negate on your Turn (you could also search Dragonruler Tempest or Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, if you are playing around with Dragons more)

now you could use the Effect of Illumination to Summon Shooting Majestic Star or just go into the normal Majestic Star</div></blockquote>
&nbsp;

As for the Symphonic Warriors themselves, they can have some interesting plays depending on what cards you draw (mainly if you have Dress Rehearsal or Symph Amplifire or not). They do however have one 2 Card combo that could be considered as their main starting play.
<blockquote><div>Summon Deejays and Summon Synthess (face-down) with it's Effect

activate Guitaris' Pendulum Effect to bounce itself and Deejays

activate Deejays' Pendulum Effect to Flip Synthess face-up

Synthess Flip Effect activates to let you Search a Symphonic Warrior-Monster (Miccs and Guitaris can Special themselves, when you have the Spells on the Field and when you have Summoned Deejays via Guitaar and still have your Normal, you can use that Search for another copy of Guitaar for it's Revive on Normal Effect instead. Alternatively you can use Guitaris' on Summon Effect to bounce the Guitaar from your Pendelum Zone to then Summon it)

Deejays' Effect activates after Synthess' Effect resolves to Summon itself back to the Field</div></blockquote>
&nbsp;

This is my first time submitting a Deck, so don't expect it to be the best, but i am having fun with it haha Personally i'm not the biggest fan of Handtraps, so you could probably enhance it yourself by putting in some copies of Ash Blossom and similar. The Deck itself is very fragile, when it has to go against Ash or Nibiru, but when you Draw the Cards you need and don't get disrupted, you can make some impressive Boards. Also before i started with this Deck i haven't played much with Pendulums. I didn't even know that they had to be Summoned from the Extra to Linked Zones haha There might be some generic Pendulum Support that could have helped the Deck lots.

Well anyways thanks for taking the time to look at this and if you have a Deck that could profit from another Normal Summon, 3 Guitaar with 1 Miccs might help lol"

Always prioritize searching out the Lord of the Heavenly Prison with Gallant Granite.

Remember that Lord of the Heavenly Prison also protects your opponents set cards so DPE cannot pop their face-downs including if you floodgate something.

Lord of the Heavenly Prison should almost always fetch Fusion Destiny or Shade Brigandine so that you can put more pressure on board.

The first deck I ever created myself. Fairly standard Blue-Eyes deck with plenty of fusions, synchro and xyz monsters, plus a couple ritual summons thrown into the mix. Heavily reliant on support cards and spells/traps to get as many strong Blue-Eyes monsters onto the field and finish the duel quickly. Discounting bad luck on the draw, usually plays out very nicely and heavily in your favour if you can effectively utilise monster effects and spells/traps at the right times."

Pretty much just relies on utilising support, spell and trap cards to get as many dragons out on the field as possible before your opponent can effectively counter, with a couple Red-Eyes Iron Knights in there to support the Slash Dragon's effect, which comes in really handy for cancelling out your opponent's spells and/or traps. The Archfiend is there more as a backup for destroying monsters with it's effect when you're in a tight spot. This is usually the deck I pull out when I can't win and it rarely lets me down, not counting bad luck on the draw of course. Plus I just love Red-Eyes monsters as a nice bonus."

It's mostly all just level 4 extenders that aim to get you an endboard of Leo Utopia Ray with Pegasus equipped for 2 monster negates, Zombiestein for an omninegate and a Dragonar with 2 materials leftover that you can use on your opponent's turn to get either a Hope Harbinger, Kragen, or even Bagooska in some really desperate situations, depending on what your opponent does. Going second, you either do like every other deck that plays 2 monsters with the same level and go straight into Zeus (through either Utopia into Prime for a 4-mat Zeus or an attack position Bagooska to ensure you get to summon the Zeus in the first place) or you punch something really hard with Utopia Double.

&nbsp;

Before I get shit for running 46 cards, the deck has 3 different engine requirements you really don't want to draw (Double or Nothing, Pegasus and the Rank-Up) and since pretty much every card is just an extender, it doesn't cause consistency issues. If you're completely set on making every one of your decks exactly 40 cards because you have yugituber brain-rot, I'd cut Astral Kuriboh, 1 each of Zubababancho and Onomatopoeia, an Xyz Change Tactics, Shade Brigandine and Armed Sage.

The deck is also not playing F0 because you usually have to do some pretty suboptimal stuff (or draw an absolute god hand) to make it turn 1 and it takes up a lot of Extra Deck space, but feel free to run it if you want to.

Another option to consider is Traptrix Rafflesia with Gravedigger's Trap Hole to avoid dying to Nibiru, but personally I think the deck is running enough bricks already and you need a pretty good hand to summon Rafflesia before you go into Nibiru range and keep going afterwards."

Finally, at long lost, Predaplants can stand on their own two feet as a competitive deck! Kind of! I decided to name it ""Yuri the Ravenous Dragon"" after Yuri, the power-hungry user of this archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V.

So here is a Predaplant deck profile featuring the new support from Dimension Force and an Albaz engine! Thanks to two of the Pendulum Monsters that Predaplants got, the deck can Fusion Summon and use Predator Counters much more easily! Branded Fusion can be used to send Predaplant Byblisp to the Graveyard, and then search a different Predaplant for further plays.

&nbsp;

Ideally, this deck can do good going first or second--having both hand trap negation in the Main Deck and backrow removal in the Side Deck--but for me personally, I tend to do better going first."

Also update regarding my complete breakdown series post: I’ve decided to put off the infernoid breakdown for a little bit because Christmas is coming up, there’s been a lot happening so far in my life (what’s of it at least) so I never got around to getting the infernoid guide written up.

As a Christmas celebration I decided to do a write up on dream mirrors. Why? Well for one: people love dream mirrors, and two: the artwork reminds me of the book “the night before Christmas”

I will get back to infernoids soon.

I’m still working it all out but for now, have a nice day!"

In this description I will show you how to play six samurais (or at least how i do it, i can bet my strategies aren't consistent)

The most important part of this deck is just using gateway of the six to non-stop use Kizan to your advantage and bringing a shit-ton of link monsters and sometimes even synchros and having lots of fun doing it.

<strong>Perfect hand is Kageki + kizan/grandmaster + any other six sam + shien + gateway </strong>

Of course this isn't anime, so god hands appear only one in 10 games but thanks to perfect spells that sams posses and also that you rarely brick means that you can make at least one borrelsword.

<strong>Main gameplan (that I use at least) is:</strong>

-if you have, place every counter based six sam spell you have (most important of them six gateway and shien's dojo)

-normal summon kageki and use his effect to special summon mizuho/shinai

-special summon kizan/grandmaster from hand

-use kizan and kageki/grandmaster to bring the  great general (make sure that he points to remaining six sams) and use his effect to search gateway (and if you have gateway already just search other spells or use him as additional counter generator)

-place gateway on the field (this is where the fun begins, if you have at least 2 counters on dojo i advice to use its effect to bring fumo)

-by that point if you had at the start of the game placed gateway, other necessities and summoned general you should have at least 4 counters on the field

<em><strong>NOW WE DO A LITTLE BIT OF TROLLING</strong></em>

-use effect of gateway to search kizan/granfmaste to add them to hand and special summon them which will fuel the mighty fire which is sim sams counter generating powers

-USE GATEWAYS EFFECT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

-if you were lucky to draw shien now is your moment to bring him

-use fumo to go into funny synchros like shi en, herald of arc light or draco berserk

-use remaining monsters to go into links, like apollousa or borrelsword

This gameplan has 2 big, overlapping issues:
<ol>
 	<li>It's impossible to achieve turn 1.</li>
 	<li>The painters don't offer any meaningful interaction during your opponent's turn in order to survive the turn.</li>
</ol>
In an attempt to last for long enough to actually get Rainbow out, I'm playing the mother of all floodgates, Mystic Mine. Through Cloudy and Snowy Canvas, you can always keep the number of monsters on your field between 1 and 0 to keep Mine live while you accumulate Painters into rotation, and kill it when you want to push for game.

The deck goes second to make Mine live and to take advantage of one of the Painters' strongest interactions, bouncing Kaijus to hand with Thundery Canvas. The Kaijus serve as recurring removal and they help you actually resolve Mine by taking out any spell negates or quick removal your opponent may have without letting your opponent respond.

&nbsp;

The ED practically doesn't matter, so I'm just playing a bunch of Maximus targets, a chonky Zeus package and an Accesscode suite, but you can pretty much just play whatever you want. You can probably even add a DPE package in there, but I'm already running a Mine deck and I don't want to overdose on cringe.

&nbsp;

The side has barely been tested so it might be a bit janky, but you have a bunch of cards for going first and some backrow hate because the deck kinda struggles against trap decks."

Step 1: DON'T
","You can usually build 2 types of BLS decks: Decks that use Envoy of the Beginning in a Light/Dark themed deck or Bad Decks.

This Archetype is starving for decent support. No the Gaias don't count, I have desperatly tried to make them work, it ends in pain. No the new Fusion dosen't count either, That one was made for Dark Magician.

You could probably improve the deck (especially the extra deck) a bit more but this is what im rolling with mainly cuz i don't know any other good cards and also laziness.

Just get the Field Spell, Slam that sucker down, go for isolde, get Super Soldier Soul, send his ass to the GY, pop his GY effect to yoink a beginning or evening knight out of the deep dark pits of your deck, use the tokens on the Field Spell and then get the boi out there! Jarngreipr is there for protection if you are either going first, have 2 lvl 1 monsters or have bricked. Puppets cause GY setup into Kaiza and Kaiza cause more GY setup either through Super Soldier Soul or Kaiki for Gilti-Gearfried. Why am I using Vanilla BLS? Because Super Soldier ritual Sucks (in this deck at least).  And also because on the off chance that you want to Ritual summon twice.

Why no Pre-Prep? You got 5 cards to get BLS and a Ritual Spell into your hands AND Pre-Prep only gets the vanilla Spell, not Synthesis (which btw lets u summon from the hand and GY, which is why Trade-in is there)."

No seriously, this deck is actually good.","https://youtu.be/N566PCNAK3E

Sharks are an oddity. The archetype itself never did anything relevant in the era it was introduced (Zexal). It mostly was just pack filler. Thanks to last year's set Eternity Code and this year's Brothers of Legend , the deck can finally function!

The deck aims to use Buzzsaw shark and a number of extenders to make rank 4's and control the game.

Number 4: Stealth Kragen is a great control tool. Combined with Gozen Match, you can create a very potent lock that is difficult to out.

You also have easy access to Utopic Draco Future

I purposely omitted a side deck, as you can just chose what fits to your local metagame.

Sorry it's been awhile....</p>
(<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/jnWfuCNJ7R8"">https://youtu.be/jnWfuCNJ7R8</a>)

So it has been awhile since I made a decently put together deck that is just as generic as my confidence for life. Anywho, because WCS season is around, and we all know it will be a blood bath that makes 2008 look like someone knocked over a bottle of water; let me clarify that I think Lyrilusc - Tri-Brigade will hold out the longest of all the current decks running around before then. However doesn't mean that Lyrilusc can hold their own with or without the entity of the Tri-Brigade. This time it is not Fraktall that is leading the charge at all. Sure he can mill, be Kit's side posse, and hold on better than Kerass; but in reality, Nervall is the one doing the important work by searching out the needed Birds for the plays that truly matter.

On the note of how the lyrilusc monsters can be useful here, let's say that I'm glad to have Crossout Designator in this deck. The reason in this case is because Special Summoning is your best friend on all fronts; from XYZ summoning, to Link Summoning, to even GY setup. What this gets you is the Utopic Future package. A very obscure package that brings you ""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"": an XYZ monster that negates and steals monsters from your opponent to use them however you want to. Other than that nothing has basically changed out of this aspiring hybrid that has so many chances of making a truly versatile impact."
