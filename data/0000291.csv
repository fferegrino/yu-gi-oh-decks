Do not play this.,"Do you win coin tosses? Do you like playing decks so low IQ they actually deal psychic damage to skilled opponents? Is you ideal opening hand one with 0 Monsters? Can't ever brick if none of your cards are bad. This deck is tough - you have to normal summon a monster and set 5 backrow. The joke is, that actually is skill intensive as a strategy. Still, this joke of a pile is sweet, better than trying to make Serziel work in these sorts of shells. I think Luna stun builds do better if you lose the coin toss, but I think this list is nastier going first. On the other hand, why play this instead of Aleister or Live Twins? Crickets. It is just to annoy people. But it is fully capable of doing that!  Luna is better, so the shell is Luna now. Sorry thing that searches Droplet."

So I made this! I tried to include all the summoning types, but this is very much made to be ""decent"" at best. This is a consistent deck (Odd-Eyes has so many searchers it's not funny) that wasn't made with any specific end board in mind, so it's game plan is a more open ended one; see what you open and where it takes you. I included all 4 Dimension Dragons and made sure the deck can summon them, because for me the win condition is summoning Z-ARC using all 4.  &nbsp;  Again, dont expect it to do well against high power decks, and I definitely made some sub-optimal choices in the name of theme, but it's fun, decently strong and pretty much endlessly customizable. The Extra Deck can be almost anything you want here, this deck literally can do it all!"

Eats the midrange decks I play, at least.","Make Sera, Set 5, Pass. Maybe Rafflesia on occasion. Some Rank 4 options are nice. Zeus is a good card. Mostly just a pile of traps. Solemns and IO for Lightning Storm and Harpie's. Trap Trick pile with lots of extra goodies. Ice Dragon's Prison is a good card. Yeah, this pile is nice. If you're playing BO1 on the ladder and you can win coin tosses this deck is pretty cracked, and I think with Multifaker at 1 this might be the better dumb trap deck if NS a monster set 5 pass is you're preferred playstyle. Eldlich does better on the ladder, but I swear this is just by the power of floodgates - this deck probably takes slightly more brainpower, and it's engine is less powerful but less bricky as well.  Continued testing and learning the deck, adjusted the list. Here's the card by card.  For Generic interruptions, I decided to keep things pretty standard, because I don't want to be caught out without hand traps even in a BO1 going second scenario (especially in a BO1 going second scenario). This may be a control deck, but I want to play the game. Adjustments have been made - Gravedigger's, Ice Dragon's, and D. Shifter are performing some of the jobs of Called By the Grave, and we're on 0 Spells to make IO ridiculously broken, but also because we just need critical mass of Trap cards and have no room for Pot cards. D. Shifter and Maxx ""C"" conflict slightly, but there's some cool tech plays you can make with both in the deck. You can keep the GY empty for the Shifter and chain Maxx ""C"" to it in response to their first summon, also very plausible when going second. You play through Shifter admirably, and oddly it enables some Shade Brigandine plays as well, and having 3 Maxx ""C"", a mass of hand traps, and 3 Shifter gives you plenty of tools to steal games, and so despite minor conflict I think this list of hand traps is tight. Imperm and Ice Dragon's also can be found off of Trap Trick, a package I've run just for that which does much more here. Our last, sort of generic interrupt cards are 3 Solemn and the 1 IO. IO is a gamestealer, and is also just generically really good, and our deck loses very little to play it. It also gives us 4 cards against 3 Lightning Storm 1 Harpie's, a not uncommon ratio of sweepers that is perhaps even reasonable with Eldlich variants stealing games all over the place (sometimes a bad deck is good).  For Traptrick monsters, I've decided to run 9 - 3 Myrmeleo, I thought this would be the best one, until I learned the plays and realized in the deck Mantis is usually better, 3 Mantis, bester starter, 2 Vesiculo, this card has really impressed me, it is worth is as our 1 monster most of the time and is a way better extender than that effect reads on impression, and 1 Dionaea, I don't think you need this card, but it is a great follow-up and searchable and summonable with the engine - I think 1 for Sera makes sense, and you'll occasionally grab this off of Mantis. I'm fine seeing 2-3 names in this engine, because you'll usually see them with the Hole that unstucks you. I also do want to actually put monsters on the board in most of my games, and hate seeing Shade Brigandine alone. I'll accept some number of bricky hands existed to insulate me from different kinds of bricky hands - I'd rather brick out with 2 monsters and 2-3 interruptions than with 5 Trap cards, but your milage may vary.  We're obviously on 3 Shade Brigandine for our main extenders - this card turns the engine on by breaking the rules of Trap cards while making Rafflesia, this card is terrible alone and insane alongside any Traptrix monster. Do no trim this card - multiples suck, but you need to open the first copy as often as possible to actually feel like you're doing anything but setting trap cards.  There are also 8 ""Traptrick"" traps, 8 holes in pairs, and 2 Trap Trick. The pairs are mostly for Trap Trick, which is pretty nutty even if you only have a couple targets, and seems cracked open here. Paul (Gravedigger's) is the best Trap Hole, but Nightmare helps us hit 5 Monster negates in the deck, and Floodgates gum up the board while disabling most summoning mechanics. These are highly accessible within the engine, you should have  access to 2-3 of these names every game. I like these numbers for the grind, this deck is slow.  In testing I found not having Accesscode was a mistake - Utopia Double takes 2 bricks in the extra deck and 1 in the main to never come up, whereas Accesscode. The extra deck is just good generic rank 4s and Zeus, with maxxed out numbers of the good Traptrix cards and single copies of the meh ones.  The maindeck remains the same, but I've realized something kinda big, that a lot of people don't seem to be one in any format... With Zoodiac Chakanine, any Rank 4 Xyz can go into Boarbow to attack directly 9 (for 0) and make a 4 material Zeus.

I think having a 4 material Zeus out of a Rank 4 material that attacks directly is kind of huge, I can't believe I haven't thought of this before."

NEVER BRICK AGAIN ,"Trying new things in hero, this current list is the most consistent list i have seen. Impossible to brick, except drawing the 1 of increase, and most of the time the hands are playable.  9 tech spots for the meta, i like this number bc it gives you a good chance to open 1 and sometimes 2, in hero you want 4 engine cards cause that is how you play through hand traps and push for game going second.  Feel free to play super poly instead of imperm or triple tactics, i dont like super poly bc i dont like giving up the extra deck slots , but you can cut the link 3 , 1 dark law, esquirdio, and bakooska and get alot of targets.  I dont play the evil heros just bc i feel hero can otk fine without it and it doesnt help the decks weeknesses with the cost of two main deck bricks.  2 poly in main deck is great, mainly for when you get impermed on vyon or to just extend. Also solid soilder and poly in hand with any normal summon hero is a good combo and can play around imperm. You can normal solid then if they imperm you can poly with the normal summon hero in hand then chain block sunriser into solid revive. Nice way to bait out imperms if you can.  Bakooska is for when you have no lines in ur hand except two lvl 4s , can still be pretty strong, and in certian match ups you wanna just make bakooska."

The goal is to spam metalfoes monsters with Rescue Rabbit, Emergency Teleport, Pendulum Scale and other lovely cards, and with them you are able to do Fusions, Xyx and Links.

It's pretty much classic. I tried many builds like PUNK/Dinomorphia to abuse of Psychic End Punisher but was sometimes too bricky. I think pure Dinomorphia is the best after all. They don't really need external support except for the generic traps of course.  I know some of Dinomorphia players won't agree with Skill Drain since we have Rexterm that does pretty much the same job but it's a very strong floodgate that allows your Kentregina to be full power and it's a backup plan to Rexterm. It also prevents you from stupidly dying to a direct attack (Hayate, the ritual Libromancer...) when you're low in life points.  Your opponent destroys your Skill Drain? It's not a concern: just make Rexterm and Skill Drain is basically back. I owe so many victories to Skill Drain.  The other floodgates are just about preferences and the decks that are played at your locals. You can play Gozen Match or Rivalry of the Warlords if you want to.  The side deck will help you to deal with going second: Shifter can end your opponent's turn, Lava Golem can get rid of problematic cards, Evenly Matched, well, you all know how strong this card is...  I made the choice to not run hand traps for the moment but maybe I will include Ash in the near future. But really, you don't need them in a deck that relies heavily on traps. If I'm reflecting on Ash it's only because I want the possibility to make Psychic End Punisher.  I'm also reflecting on some other cards: fossil dig + Misc, Lost World..."

I figured that the P.U.N.K engine has a lot of the solutions to the problems of the deck. They don't clog your hand, they're level 3, they pump out synchro monsters. This is pretty much everything infernity wants. I would appreciate some ideas from better yugioh players lol. Essentially you're looping Infernity archfiend which the many ways to Monster Reborn it to create 4 mat Apollousa, and a really big Borreload Savage Dragon with a Saryuja equipped to it with a Infernity Barrier set.

Dogmatic Evil * Twins,"So, Live/Evil * Twin is in a very strange spot in this meta. Without Trouble Sunny, the deck has some trouble closing out games, and can't quite achieve its full potential in terms of card advantage. Still, we're 1 link away from the deck getting a lot better. I decided after playing a pure list for a while to branch into a Dogmatika engine splash. I've always been high on Ecclesia, and while usually that is for Punishment, Fleurdelis seems pretty insane in this build.  The idea is pretty simple - cut Home for Ecclesia, which is better as an extender and will serve as a fine alternate starters, make some space in the extra deck for some bricks, and run it back. This list is pretty much my pure Evil Twin list with that minor adjustment, and so far it is performing much better for me. Let's get into the card by card.  So, Live Twins, we're on 7, 3 Lil-la, 2 Ki-Sikil, 1 Frost, 1 Treat. Frost and Treat together put us up to what feels like an effective 7 extenders, since each only extends out of 1 Twin play, and they're usually not that useful, but Frost's draw power is truly ridiculous, and Treat's battle effect will save your Twin's butts reasonably often. We trim Ki-Sikil because we want more of our starts that lead into Frost, to maximize the draw power of the engine. You could cut Treat, and you could consider 2 (or maybe even 3) Frost, but I like these numbers. We're also on 3 Password and 3 Sunny's Snitch. Password in this version is basically just more Snitches, though it will occasionally search out the Evil Twins maindeck monster. Snitch is insane - the little bit of drain disables a lot of OTKS, and also enables a lot of OTKs as well, that little chip goes a long way even without time in the deck. Since you can search Treat and Frost these are still sort of extenders, even if that aspect is diminished by the cutting of Home. We also run a lone copy of Twins. The Evenly style effect is very good on occasion, but mostly it's just a 4.4k beater, and it is good at opening up KOs by doing that. It'll be better once Sunny is here, both when you see it to OTK, and to have a backup way to send (which is searching it) for the cost of Trouble's board breaking prowess. For now the card is just fine. One card I've cut quite deliberately is the 1 good trap, Evil Twin Present. The card is fine, but I'm not sold on it being very good to see or search in most instances. If it was better at dealing with backrow it would make the cut, but it deliberately doesn't shoot down a flipped floodgate, and that just feels way too slow most of the time, and the trade effect is IMO way worse than Enemy Controller, which I'd normally never run, but feels pretty sweet in this list.  Dogma package is pretty standard IMO, you don't see this a lot these days, but since DPE and other similar packages conflict with Evil Twins I think it really is the best card for this role here. Nadir Servant is freaking wild, and always has been, but we're also still hoping to see Ecclesia the normal way as well (though if we had 2 servant, I'd cut to 2 Ecclesia). The extra deck space for this package is kind of tight, I still want Almiraj for I:P and Bagooska plays as well as to extend into Ecclesia when a Twin gets Ashed, Impermed, etc. Then there are 2 cards you run with the package - Fleurdelis, which is a non-targeting Imperm so long as you have Ecclesia on board, but also just a free SS2 Special, and with it's ATK buff ability it enables OTK lines quite easily (Twins + Ecclesia = Fleurdelis is over 9000!). I usually find Fleurdelis a little bricky, but this deck needs the free beater and the negate enough that typically the Knighted feels pretty good even without Ecclesia, and truly exemplary with her.  I'm also on 3 Parallel Exceed. This are much worse without the Accesscode OTK line, which came up a fair bit, but are primarly to make Bagooska anyways. I cut Zeus for a Wind Peg when I found I needed a 3rd target to send with the Dogma package - Zeus and Goddess are both potentially good here, but I found Goddess almost never came up and often couldn't be summoned when you needed it, whereas Zeus very rarely came up, and never felt essential, and usually wasn't in great form for a Zeus anyhow. The interruptions are pretty standard for Evil Twin as well - the usual Ash/Maxx ""C"" cards are here with some backrow disruption, plus Imperm and Droplet. Droplet is way better here than you'd think - the ""battle trap"" style ability of it is super clutch here, and the tech play of sending your monsters from the field to the GY to protect them from Imperm/Veiler/Chixiao... etc... is super clutch. Enemy Controller is also in the mix, it's the 4th copy of Droplet for that cray tech play, but wildly enough ditching your own monster to steal one feels amazing, especially when it enables a Twin effect, and weirdly the ""switch to defense mode"" option comes up a lot if you remember the card does that. I think it's hilariously on theme that the ""gamer gurl"" deck with a card called ""GG EZ"" is the one TCG/OCG deck that actually wants the Gamepad in its list, but I've also had such luck with this card that I don't want to cut it. It never quite feels good enough as a 2 of, but always feels good as a 1 of.  3 of each Evil Twin is needed in the Extra Deck to actually have plays - you'll go through 2 of 1 name on your first turn. Once Trouble Sunny is here, you can cut down to 2/2/2. Bagooska is also basically essential if you run the Exceed package, and is arguably the main reason to run this package. The Drunkard Tapir has slowly gone from a niche tech option to a staple in most extra decks as more and more white people have realized how busted he is. (It seems like the Asians always knew, and I picked up the tech off of a black guy, but I swear us white people used to never play this card). Almiraj is... still nutty, by the simple virtue of being a link 1, and between Exceed and Ecclesia I think you still need to run this card. I:P is also debatable, especially without Goddess or Knightmare Phoenix, but there are good I:P setups, and making a protected Unchained Abomination remains a really good use of your resources. I think Abom and Unicorn are mandatory, I make Unicorn, mull a card while spinning a card, and then make A-Bomb on followups pretty often. Without Trouble in the deck, A-Bomb is your main Link 4, and it enables nutty engine stuff with the link 2s, and I think the tech actually gets better with Trouble (I:P + Trouble = A-Bomb into Twins having set up Trouble and gotten both Twins to chain each other). Accesscode is also probably essential - it just does close out games, the card is very very good. I think there's some room to wiggle with this extra deck, mainly you could cut Wind Peg for mostly anything, Almiraj rarely comes up, and Accesscode is very good but not always needed, but I like this Extra Deck a lot overall.  I've made the adjustment off of Wind Pegasus for Psy-Framelord Omega. Omega helps the Dogmatika engine grind and is also grave hate - initially it was just to have a target that let me search Fleurdelis, but in practice the card is insane and has already won me games I should have, and would have, lost without it. In like my first couple games.  I slightly adjusted the Dogmatika line-up, cutting 1 Ecclesia for a lone Effect Veiler. There's some internal debate about whether Veiler or Chalice is better - the advantages to each have come up when I've tested with both. But I decided to lean towards Effect Veiler, if only to round out my interruptions vs FTKs and screwed up floodgate monsters like Protos. This minor adjustment improved my win-rate almost immediately (though admittedly I'm also just getting better at playing the deck.) You really don't need the 4th Ecclesia in most matchups, and it actually results in you seeing too many Dogma cards too often when you run it, whereas having 18 ""1-for-1"" interruptions is super crucial to the deck's gameplan of drawing cards while trading well. Trouble Sunny should help this deck more than Adventure hurts it, so I'm looking forward to the next selection pack."

Snow and Forecast are one card starters, you can set up a pretty decent board by drawing into either of them.  A good turn 1 board usually consists of one or two the weather monsters and snowy, thundery and rainbowed canvas. You can achieve that pretty easily by using any level 3 The Weather and Snowy Canvas or just with the one card starters I listed above.  The main strategy is having a few (3 or 4 usually works pretty well) the weather spell or trap cards and Rainbow or Moonbow to abuse their effects and spam negates and return everything to the opponent's hand. Also Rainbow can send herself to GY to negate a summon so you can use it to stop floodgates."

To be honest, not much will change for me. 0 cards are different in the main deck than what I am running right now in the meta - I think the addition of Adventurers and Floowandereeze will have a big impact, but it doesn't really change what Evil Twin wants to run all that much - meanwhile Trouble Sunny slots in nice and easy, barely changing the extra deck - you cut some Evil Twins for different Evil Twins now that you don't need as many.  Despite not gaining very many cards, I think the deck gets a whole lot better rather than worse with this pack. Adventurers are strong, but the power boost this engine gets from Trouble cannot be overstated. The deck already excels at gaining card advantage and interacting, but Trouble seriously pushes that to new heights while opening up OTK lines left, right, and center. It also doesn't hurt that much to lose 1 for 1 interrupts to Gryphon Rider in this deck - that's sort of how the engine gains advantage over time, by 1-for-1ing people while drawing cards. It's an unusual strat in 2022, but many games the deck can seriously snowball even without Maxx ""C"". In fact, this is one of those decks where Maxx ""C"" not resolving actually feels really good (they're just playing into your plan when they 1-for-1 you!)  This list runs 2 ""extender"" packages - Parallel Exceed helps make Bagooska, which is seriously OP in this Link based shell, and is even summonable after using a Twin effect (and somehow Exceed into Bagooska is canon for Live Twins?) Exceed also helps to make I:P - I:P + Trouble is one of the deck's power boards, setting up 2 draws into Abomination + Twins. Also, in a pinch you can Almiraj + Exceed into either Bagooska or I:P into Unicorn. This package is good, but if you're in a BO3 event you'll cut these game 2 relatively often. This is the kind of deck where having 20 interactive cards truly pays off.  The other extender package is the Dogmatika cards. Thanks to Evil Twins restrictions, Ecclesia ends up being far more reliable than DPE or really any other alternative here. Oddly, Fleurdelis, which I tend to find a bit bricky, is also very very clutch for this engine, and feels good even without Ecclesia here, just for the absence of good beaters. This package actually opens up more OTKs than it kills (by removing Update Jammer - Transcode) because of Fleurdelis being busted. Punishment is kind of weak here - great if it stops their turn, but worthless if your board gets broken and you're locked out of the extra deck, so I'd search Fleurdelis most of the time if you have to choose, and I'd consider carefully before activating Punishment in this deck. I think you still need to run this card in the engine, and it does win games, but it should be considered at high-risk of untimely activation.  I've made one minor change to the deck - Wind Peg is out, Omega is in. I needed a card to send to search Fleurdelis for value, but honestly, being able to recycle your Dogmatika bricks is also insanely clutch. Omega is so good you don't even need to summon him for him to be the best there is at what he does! It came up pretty fast after making the switch, and while Wind Pegasus is good, Omega has already made himself indispensable.  Still perpetually tuning. I cut a single Ecclesia for a lone copy of Chalice, freeing up space in the extra deck to run Lightning Storm as additional board breaker cards going second. The third Ecclesia was just slightly bricky, but more importantly, isn't that important for achieving preferred Dogmatika ratios. I realized when building the side plan that in a lot of matchups I don't even want the third Ecclesia, and doing some math it hurts slightly more than it helps.  I have a basic Side Deck plan here for BO3 events. May not actually enter any, but I figured I'd share. I considered the top 6 decks I thought I would see in the racist metagame, and came up with these 6 (in no particular order)  &nbsp;  Eldlich Control/Zombie World Eldlich  Tri-Bri (Zoo, and Bird)  Swordsoul variants  Racist Prank-Kids  Virtual World (P.U.N.K. and Racist)  Floowanderdeze nuts  &nbsp;  I based my side deck around siding for these matchups, as well as running as many generic cards that I thought I could bring in when any of my cards were bad, after compiling a list of staples I thought would be good.  <em><strong>Basic siding guide for Evil Twins Dogmatika, in the Adventurer (racist) metagame.</strong></em>  <strong>Eldlich/Zombie Eldlich</strong>  Out - 3x Imperm 3x Droplet  In - 1x Cosmic Cyclone 1x Twin Twisters 1x Red Reboot 1x Harpie's Feather Duster 2x Skull Meister  This basically stands in for any backrow matchup, though Skull Meister is only for GY based Trap decks, really mainly Eldlich. The goal is to go down on bad cards that only hit Monsters, our Chalice effects, and up on Backrow hate. Because of my style I'm on cards that are good going first and second rather than Lightning Storm or Evenly, but you could sub those in and be very happy when you go second. Cut Imperm before Droplet, since sending a monster from the field to the GY is a bonus in this deck. You could consider D.D. Crow, but I've always found Meister to be higher impact in general, even though for the specific matchups I'm preparing for Crow might actually be better, so it is something to consider.  <strong>Tri-Bri (Bird Up and Zoo)</strong>  Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia 1x Imperm 1x Ash 1x Maxx ""C""  In - 2x Skull Meister 1x Red Reboot 2x Chalice  These 2 decks are basically the same, though Bird Up can make Barrier Statues and end on bigger boards, whereas Zoo Tri is just more consistent and more powerful going second. Either way, our goal is to neuter their negate(s) on our turn. Reboot only comes in if they're on Revolt (all Zoo are, some Bird Up aren't), but Meister should come in whether they are DPE or not. I don't want to cut Maxx ""C"" but Zoo plays through it very well, and vs Bird Up Chalice might just be better anyways, especially since we're reducing the risk of seeing multiples.  <strong>Swordsoul (Racist, Protos, P.U.N.K.)</strong>  There are so many ways to play this deck. Protos. DPE. P.U.N.K. Rose Dragon. Adventurer. That doesn't even count Blind Second Swordsoul Tenyi, or account for the Tenyi ratios and support varying dramatically from shell to shell, or pay any mind to Trap variants, so while this is a good guide overall, this is the matchup where you should tailor your interrupts against the version you are facing.  Pure Protos Out - 1x Ash Blossom 1x Ecclesia 1x Droplet  In - 3x Effect Veiler  The deck is well tuned to Swordsoul in general, thankfully, but a single Protos is the most devastating thing they can do turn 1, and while Ash is needed vs Maxx ""C"", it doesn't do a lot in the matchup as a distruption. Droplet is good vs Swordsoul in general, but bad against Protos, and holding the Imperm can be wrong in the matchup. As a result, we're trimming a Droplet, Ecclesia, and an Ash, and slamming 3 Effect Veiler. We're hoping to stop them on their turn from locking us out of the game on ours. Otherwise, bizz as uzhe.  Racist  Out - 3x Paralell Exceed 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia  In - 3x Ghost Ogre 2x Chalice  Vs the Adventurer versions of the deck, stopping the Adventure becomes a priority, whereas extending is great and all, but simply not as valuable. 2 Chalice come in vs most versions, but if they're on Protos side into the Effect Veiler instead.  P.U.N.K/DPE  No changes (run-er back)  OR  Adjust for backrow  This version of the deck we're tuned for, but if they're leaning into backrow, you may have to bring in sweepers, since Swordsoul is a surprisingly good trap deck.  Also consider making cuts for Meister if they are on DPE. This is the deck you'll most often have to ""wing-it"" against tho, seriously, Swordsoul is a spicy deck.  <strong>Adventurer Prank-Kids (DPE)</strong>  Out - 2x Cosmic Cyclone 3x Imperm  In - 1x Harpie's Feather Duster 1x Twin Twisters 3x Ghost Ogre  If DPE, also - Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia  In - 2x Skull Meister  Prank-Kids with the Adventurer engine is very powerful, and while DPE can be hard to make space for, the combination of the 3 engines is extremely powerful in a swingy sort of way. However, Chalice style effects deal with Battle Butler and Gryphon Rider pretty well, and Ghost Ogre and Ash answer Adventure pretty well, so you're playing to see if they're on DPE and decided whether to bring in Meisters or not. You could bring in more sweepers, but mostly you just want to replace single target backrow hate for stuff that sweeps Adventure and Pranks.  <strong>VW (P.U.N.K./Adventurer)</strong>  Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia 1x Lil-la Treat  In - 2x Chalice 1x Harpie's  If Racist Out - 3x Parallel Exceed In - 3x Ghost Ogre  This deck is tough to prepare for, because you want all of your cards and then some. Going up on backrow hate very slightly will keep the trap from being too troublesome, but there isn't enough room to overprepare for VW Gates. Instead, you have to focus on stopping VFD from taking over, and while Ash will help with that somewhat, truth be told Chalice style effects are your best friend here. If they're on Adventurers instead of P.U.N.K. cards cutting your Exceed won't kill most of your starts, but having some Ghost Ogre will absolutely swing the matchup. In this matchup, extending isn't anywhere near as important as being able to simply play.  <strong>Floowandereeze</strong>  Out 3x Parallel Exceed  In - 1x Red Reboot 2x Chalice  I guess this is deck #6 to beat? This might actually be the dumb control deck to beat in the new meta instead of Eldlich, but I think we're tuned okay to beat it. Bringing in both Chalice should give us tools to beat the deck's weird Floodgates, to the point that I think Chalice is better than Imperm here. Red Reboot stops the trap. You could consider Ghost Ogre if it looks like they're on 3 of the Field Spell, and I think most will be, but it isn't actually necessary, so feel the meta out.  That actually leaves 1 slot to play with. I opted for Dinowrestler Pankratops, just a good generic going second card. When you know you're going second, it can come in over Backrow hate and generally be more useful, but it is just an all-purpose card that should come in whenever you are not going first."

Activate Zombie World as early as possible so you can get a free Dragonecro from milling a Tearalaments Monster. Typically you are looking to make Baronne early with the Wandering Gryphon Rider and Uni-Zombie or Ze Amin and then go into Halqifibrax to pull out Glow-Up Bloom. Link the Glow-Up Bloom into Linkuriboh in order to pull out Changshi and then send a card based on what you need at the moment. The path to a final board will be very dependent on what you mill, but it can pretty consistently get Baronne, Zombie Dragon Lord, Yuki-Onna (from link laddering with Vampire Fascinator), and Halqifibrax on the field with Balerdroch in the graveyard for next turn. If the Artifact Scythe was milled, you can revive it during the opponents draw phase using Zombie Dragon Lord and then Halqifibrax into Formula Synchron to make Chengying during the main phase. If Artifact Scythe is still in the deck, you can Halqifibrax into Shooting Riser, send Artifact Scythe to make it level 2, then Synchro for Chengying with Balerdroch and revive Scythe with Zombie Dragon Lord. If all goes well, the final board on your opponents' turn should have at least Baronne, Chengying, Zombie Dragon Lord, Yuki-Onna, and Artifact Scythe with its lock in place. Make sure to get use out of Balerdroch's negate and banish before you synchro him away as well if possible."

You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!!!!!  It's all mirror force, plus a little extra. There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps just to keep your enemy guessing to your strategies and shut down every move they make with cards like Skill drain. Lots of things to make any opponent loose their mind. Plus a kuribo that keeps your enemy from attacking just to throw a cherry on top."

The deck is a speed roid strategy, plus the windwitch engine. The engine allows you to go +2 in card advantage without using your normal, with the drawback of synchro lockin you. That's true only for the ice belle line, that gives you either a battle protected baronne or an effect destruction protected crystal wing. The deck can play around floodgates decently, thanks to cards like apoullousa, wind pegasus and kite drake. also even under skill drain you usually can summon 3k beaters easily."

I thought of making and playing this deck when I felt the biggest drawback of pure Sky Strikers going second was to brick with only spells and no monsters to get on the board, while with Eldlich/Balerdroch it was having monsters ready but not many spells to react with on your turn if you were to go second. Since both playstyles involve having generally few/recycleable monsters on board with most things happening in the GY, it seemed fun to combine the two, since I have not seen many people play this. Played this deck up to Diamond 2 in Master Duel (with some substitutions because of the different rulings and cards like Linkage! and H.A.M.P. not being released yet in TCG at the time of this edit), so it holds its ground with the main drawback of being inconsistent with the opening hand.

If this is the case my friend, well I have the deck for you. While indeed this does tend to get devoured by the jaws of death (known only as <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>), Invoked - Branded - Blue-Eyes combines all the absolute simplicity of recreating the German Blitzkrieg strategy without years of planning or making literal investment (except when I had to do in a span of a week). All that is needed is a pilot that is familiar with Fusion based mechanics, and a optimal side deck that stops pesky hand traps from the oncoming siege in Gdańk itself (like <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> or <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>).</p> Now if you aren't familiar with these three archetypes already, I'll give you a TL;DR rundown to save time within this paragraph for the sake of trying to simplify; but be clear about these three to who aren't familiar with them already. <span>Aleister on normal summon searches the spell card</span> <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> <span>and goes into either</span> <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, <span>or</span> <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>. <span>Branded package is based around the monster</span> <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, <span>who has multiple fusion monsters that can</span> <span>help in various situations (whether it would be to recover banished pieces, extend fusion plays, or clear away a big ol' threat).</span> <span>Then we got the Blue-Eyes arsenal that (while no longer on terms and conditions with its Synchro monsters) can still cause collateral damage, and has new support to protect other monsters (and cause trouble for your opponent), such as </span><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon </a><span>and</span> <a data-name=""Dictator of D."">Dictator of D.</a>  Now the question I have had during testing, but only for the part where Blue-Eyes comes in: How does Seto Kaiba's iconic monster have synergy between both Invoked and Branded strategies? To simply put it, it's a LIGHT-Attribute, Dragon-Type Monster that can be anywhere at any time for any scenario. Hence why I have the fusion monster <a data-name=""Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon on"">Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon on </a>standby. How I do it though is this: I use <a data-name=""Branded fusion"">Branded fusion</a> to mill your <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> and maybe something like <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> (if on the field) or <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> (if in my deck); to then get <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a>, and proceed to collect all of my Dragon-Type monsters that are banished or in the GY (including Lubellion) to be recycled for second/third use. As a result, I can continue creating efficient boards without having to worry about resources or having to budget out what I have to use in one singular turn when it comes to getting that point on hand."

The general strategy, is to link summon Knightmares and when you activate their effects, discard a danger card. I added Orcust Knightmare to get some extra damage and it can be summoned back using World Legacy - World Wand. The Xyz monsters are what you make of them. Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack can link climb, Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon can do lots of damage. The one I like the most is Number 7: Lucky Straight. I feel it is the same energy as the Danger cards summon condition. I didn't add Ash Blossom Because I wanted to keep the deck somewhat ""budget"", but if you wanted to add them i would take out 1 Danger Thunderbird, 1 Twin Twister, and 1 Dark World Dealings.  &nbsp;  Overall, this is just meant to be a fun deck. if you no someone who's trying to get into the game, this would be a fun deck for them."

Now what if your deck was made entirely of your back row??? You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!,"They key to any good strategy is your back row. Now what if your deck was made entirely of your back row??? You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!!!!!  It's all mirror force, plus a little extra. There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps just to keep your enemy guessing to your strategies and shut down every move they make with cards like Skill drain. Lots of things to make any opponent loose their mind. Plus a kuribo that keeps your enemy from attacking just to throw a cherry on top."
