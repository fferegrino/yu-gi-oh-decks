The combo is we make <strong>2 lv7 on field</strong> and overlay it to Ebon Illusion Magician to fetch our tuner Magicalibra for Halqifibrax combo. Toon Dark Magician and Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon easily accompolish that, so we play to turbo both. Cards like The Black Stone of Legend (our main normal summon, ss Red-Eyes from deck), Magicians Souls (fetches Toon DM to gy or ss og DM as lv7 fodder), Toon Table of Contents (adds any Toon, mostly Toon DM as Toon Red-Eyes can summon it from hand), Where Arf Thou (works with both Black Stone and Magicians Souls), One for One, Dark Magic Veil (ss dark spellcaster from hand or gy, works with DM lineup), and lastly Tenyi Adhara (tuner lv1) or Vishuda (lv7 with bounce effect).  The Halqifibrax combo with Borreload Savage Dragon and Herald of the Arc Light is very suitable to this deck as it only uses small extra deck space and can search Relinquished lineup as follow up play. Fusion lineup is for either Eyes Restrict or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (since we run og DM, I think Dragoon is the best addition here), being Instant Fusion and Magicalized Fusion (Millenium-Eyes Restrict or Dragoon). Not only that, Dark Magic Veil can revive both Eyes Restrict and Dragoon too. We also use spellcaster support like Selene for Accescode since the Toon spell easily dump 3 spells and we run bunch of spellcaster anyway. Can put in Chimeratech Megafleet too as we have Toon Cyber Dragon. Toon Briefcase is just another search target and we can make it online if we have Toon monster for spare. Kaiju works well too, either as Relinquished fodder or lv7 xyz material. Imduk is there to utilize og DM with Magicalized Fusion for Dragoon.  We dont play the Toon Kingdom lineup as it banishes 3 cards from deck (we have combo pieces) and while its protection effect is good, sitting on Toon monsters aint good enough. Relinquished also clashes with Toon as Relinquished is super good going second while most of the Toons cant atk the turn they are summoned, so this deck is made to synergize both Relinquished and Toon.  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/e5/MaximillionPegasus-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Themed, good board setup with follow up, consistency is borderline acceptable.  Cons: Board is easily broken, lack of recursion, both Toon DM and Red-Eyes cant atk the turn it is summoned and only have moderate atk as beater."

The deck can go first or second, but in my experience, it's probably best just to go first and try to prevent your opponent from building an unstoppable board.  There's definitely some room for experimentation here! For example, you may consider running the wind invoked monster in place of Apollousa or Dweller. Or maybe you want to do the whole buster lock thing with Union Carrier.  The deck can be super strong and in the right hands keep up with the best! It's a fun deck and people will be happy to take a break from all the Eldies and Rock People. Have fun with it and let me know if you have any cool ideas to help refine the list!"

The best I could come up with was Lightsworns since they have couple of Beast-Warriors to go for Eagle and use as material for Swan. They can also mill cards to grave which helps with Eagle's, Panda's and Dragon's effects. The spells can also mill Wulf which makes summoning arguably the most improtant card of the deck, Eagle, easier. I first tried using Luminas instead of Aurkus, Lightsworn Monk but kept constantly wanting Lumina to be a Beast-Warrior type so I changed it. I think adding the Lightsworns made the deck brick less and make better combos but it is still quite bricky and starting the combos needs a bit too much resources compared to some meta decks for example. Hence the lack of hand traps and other generic protection and destruction cards.  <strong>Replays</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuc22l4xps"

Ideally you need to go first, this deck will struggle vs an established board. If you can make Gallant Granite before Halq, do it and the opponent will be forced to negate it. Gallant and Doki are cards the opponent are forced to negate otherwise they'll give you too much advantage. If you can resolve Halq then go for Martial Metal Marcher combos and it should be off to the races. You're playing 4 copies of Block Dragon, try and hold it as long as possible or use it as material for an Apollousa. Block Dragon is how you're pushing through hand traps, without Block Dragon you're likely to lose. Worst case scenario, you can attach it using Union Carrier but you more want to save Carrier to attach Buster Dragon to force the opponent to scoop. The ideal end board should comprise of: Apollousa of at least 3 negates, Union Carrier, I:P Masquerena, Herald of the Arc Light, Savage Dragon with 2 counters and Buster Dragon attached, Dweller with Tackle Crusader as material, and Block Dragon to be used with I:P to make unicorn which will then be co-linked with Carrier to go +4.  &nbsp;  Game 2 Side in the hand traps and try to block the opponent's combo as best you can. You have 14 hand traps to work with, all of which can either block Halq Combos or stop Auroradon/Linkross combos, so use them wisely. Game 3 side in exchange to get rid of dark ruler or anything else that can threaten your board. Toughest matchup is the mirror since its very die roll dependent. Its not impossible to win going second vs the mirror but its quite an uphill battle if you dont open imperm or nibiru."

The goal is to be a Zombies deck, running Eldlich cards as a control engine. It means running 2 card combos instead of Jet Synchron, and makes the routing a little heavy on extra deck space, but the deck has follow-up and interactions for days. Let's begin.  3 Uni-Zombie and 2 Shiranui Solitaire make up an eighth of the deck, meaning odds are we'll see them in our top 8 cards. These numbers are run because with 6 it always feels like you see 2 too often. These form a 2 card combo with any of Zombie World, Glow-Up Bloom, or Necroworld Banshee. 2 Banshee and 2 Glow-Up Bloom give us access to Zombie world in the case of banshee, and the choice of Doomking Balerdroch or Eldlich the Golden Lord from Glow-Up Bloom. These numbers help ensure you see the combo reasonably often, and makes follow-up plays possible. 2 Doomking Balerdroch are the maindeck boss monsters, and make a Halquifibrax combo that ends on 3 interactions plus Zombie World. Vampire Fraulein is an OTK with Dragonecro, in addition to being a level 5 combo piece and defensive hand trap. Worth it as a 1 of in the Zombie build, because you can summon it with Eldlixers, and pure Zombies plays it anyways. Rivalry of Warlords locks people out of playing non-zombie monsters with Zombie World, and is basically a Zombie card. Super Poly is likewise a zombie card, and is a 1 of to search it with Predaplant Verte Anaconda to make Dragonecro super poly as a link 2, just a 3rd line of play that's good going second, basically. 3 Zombie World is essential, half of our deck only works if this card is on the field, so playing 3 with everyone running Cosmic Cyclone for Eldlich seems like a good idea.  For the Eldlich half of the deck, we have pretty standard numbers with some minor trims for deckspace reasons. 3 Golden Lord is pretty standard. Zombies plays 2 of these anyways, and we need to have more Golden Lords than we do Eldlich cards in a game. They're gonna get banished so 3 is essential in my opinion. 3 Cursed Eldland is insane, if find you Golden Lord, it finds you other interaction, it sets up your GY, this card is also nuts with Performapal Popperup going first. It's also one of the Eldlich combo extenders needed for second string follow-ups / alternatives. 3 Scarlet Sanguine, but only 2 Black Awakening and 1 White Destiny. Different names are important, as is recuring zombie threats such as golden lord and Balerdroch. These 6 cards are all also extenders in second string plays. 2 each of Conquistador and Huaquero is pretty standard, these are the meat of the deck, and combo pieces. 1 Golden Land Forever gives us a searchable omni-negate, good in games when you just go off on turn one, and pretty okay in middling games as well. I'd run 2, but space is tight.  3 Performapal Popperup is our card draw of choice. I know it works well in Eldlich, and it definitely has synergies in Zombies. Drawing 3 cards deeper into the deck while pitching cards for fun and profit leads to some extreme highs, and it can mitigate middling hands as a mulligan in a pinch. Better than Souls' here because we want to pitch monsters about as often as spells/traps.  Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion is a brick, but it makes the Herald+Raptite combo possible. Ghost Ogre is not a complete brick, but it here to be an extra interruption off of Needlefibre. Easy money. We even make the Ghost Girl a ghost with Zombie World.  Extra deck space is tight. 3 Needlefibre are essential. 2 are used in the deck's main combo, and 1 is used in follow-up plays. Linkuriboh makes Glow-Up Bloom into full combo with Zombie World, which just increases the odds of seeing 2 card Needlefibre combos more often. Linkross, Martial Metalmarcher, and Wonder Magician go into Borreload Savage on your opponent's turn + Herald of the Arc Light on yours, plus maybe a spell/trap pop with Wonder Magician out of our 2 card Needlefibres.  The second engine is a 3 card combo, but a fairly redundant one to put together, which ends on Ghost Ogre + Huquero/Conquistador interruption + Dawn Dragster on their turn, which draws a card off Formula Synchron. You can even use Fraulein for added consistency.  The last string of plays is Predaplant Verte Anaconda to Super Poly their monsters into Dragonecro. I'd love to run more of these, but space is sooo tight in the main and extra.  Train cards eventually win games by OTKs. Red Splatter makes this much easier.  Combo 1 can be done with a bunch of cards, but for simplicity, we'll focus on Uni-Zombie + Zombie World. <ol>  	<li>Play Zombie World</li>  	<li>Play Uni-Zombie</li>  	<li>Send Glow-Up Bloom to GY</li>  	<li>Banish Bloom, ss Balerdroch</li>  	<li>Link Balerdroch and Uni-Zombie into Needlefibre, ss O-Lion.</li>  	<li>Link Needlefibre in Linkross, ss 2 tokens.</li>  	<li>Synchro O-Lion and a token into Martial Metalmarcher. O-lion chain 2, Marcher chain 1, ss token, ss Uni-Zombie.</li>  	<li>Synchro Marcher + level 3 token into Raptite with O-lion in the GY. Synchro Herald of the Arclight.</li>  	<li>During opponents standby phase ss Balerdroch.</li> </ol> Zombie World locks you out of Auroradon.  Combo 2 involves previously mentioned Zombie cards plus a bunch of combinations of Eldlich cards. For simplicity, we'll use Uni-Zombie, Zombie World, and Red Splatter. <ol>  	<li>Play Zombie World</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Uni-Zombie. Send Glow-Up Bloom to the GY.</li>  	<li>Banish Glow-Up Bloom, ss Golden Lord.</li>  	<li>Link Uni-Zombie and Golden Lord into Needlefibre, ss Ghost Ogre.</li>  	<li>Set Red Eldlixir.</li>  	<li>ss Golden Lord, send red splatter to the GY.</li>  	<li>Banish Red Eldlixir for your choice of Conquistador and Huaquero.</li>  	<li>Opponents turn you have Ghost Ogre, an Eldlich Trap, and you can banish Needlefibre to ss Formula Synchron, draw a card, and synchro it and the level 5 monster into Dawn Dragster for a negate.</li> </ol> The third-string play is just Super Poly out of Verte Anaconda, a power play for sure and great going second to break boards.  Profile already changed. Basically I'm trying to make the grind game more consistent."

Next you use DHoles ability to revive the other Tindangle(NOT Intruder or DHoles), then Intruder will chain the effect and will special summon itself in face down position. You should have 3 face down monsters.  Then you activate Nagel's Protection to make your Tindangles's invincible to your opponents card effects.Finally End your Turn.  When your opponents monster attacks the Tindangle, make sure they attack the Jhrelth or Intruderr to flip them face up and add 2 Tindangle monster's from your deck to your hand.  FYI Your opponent can flip Protecter to trigger its search effect that will flip all the Tindangle's and search even more cards.(About 3 if used correctly.)  Then you want to activate your searched Jhrelth to discard the TRAP Tindangle Delaunay to then activate Delaunay's effect to banish itself  to summon back the destroyed Tindangle's last turn.  But if they negated it, don't worry, just stall out for one turn. Use Trinity since he is immune to battle.  Then activate the Tindangle Delaunay that was previously negated(If it wasn't just LINK Summon Tindangle Acute Cerberus just make sure to put Tindangle Base Gardna in the GY.) to summon DHoles, Jhrelth, Protector and Intruder.  Wait for your opponent to do their turn. When they're done, you want to flip Protector face up to reveal the rest of the Tindangle's to draw 3 cards. Next, activate Jhrelth's effect to search any Tindangle.  After That, you can LINK Summon Acute Cerberus. If you use Trinity as one of the materials you can search a Gergonne's End and discard a Euler's Circuit to the GY, then activate Euler's Circuit to banish itself and discard 1 Tindangle in your hand to serach another Euler's Circuit and then activate the field spell to make it where your opponent cannot attack you if you control 3 or more Tindangle monsters which you probably already have with a lot of set-up.(Also you should activate a Nagel's Protection along with the wombo-combo you did to put a lot of Tindangle's in the GY especially Base Gardna.)When you activate Nagel and you attack with Acute Cerberus doing double damage and could OTK if u have 2 Tindangle's CO-LINKED to Acute Ceberus.  Although it seems like a tough deck to set-up since this is a flip deck. You can actually pull off some NEAT Wombo-Combo's.

Adam maybe 1 out of 10 and thats if you get the hand loop wipe on them.  &nbsp;  The Deck still runs Lock Down, Hand loop, or OTK.  &nbsp;  I've changed a lot out and found this to be currently the best version of the deck.  &nbsp;  Once again this lacks a lot recovery and is very weak against ash or infinite.  I can't go through all the combos but one that really neat is Rag Tensu Troll/Cat it allows for a free summons and then link off him and rag back the troll it just plays really nice honestly.  &nbsp;"

One of them and the best one is <strong>Millenium Revelation</strong>, discard <strong>Phoenix</strong> and search <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>.</li>  	<li>You can also discard it for the effect of <strong>One for One</strong> in order to summon <strong>Crystal Girl</strong>.</li>  	<li>When you have it there your GY is set up as well.

Haven't really played Yu-Gi-Oh in a while, but this little patch should clear up a good part of the deck clutter that I experienced with it.  A really few really nice combos I discovered while play-testing.  You can summon 'Silent Wobby' to your opponents side of the field, and not only do you gain 2000 life-points, wobby also acts as fodder to start that kaiju brawl.  if you start with 'Owner's Seal in your hand, you can instead of Special Summoning two kaijus, summon 1 to your opponent's side of the field then retake control of it leaving your opponent theoretically defenseless.  In the current META due to 20 minute long combos that involve lots of tributing and discarding and effect activating getting 'Kyoutou Waterfront' out on the field is essential!  'Neo-Spacian Grand Mole' can make a pretty nifty loop combo, by tributing your opponents boss monster to summon a kaiju before sp. summoining your own and normal summoning 'Grand Mole', you can attack your opponent's kaiju with 'Grand Mole' and send it back to your hand leaving them without a boss monster, you can continue this loop almost infinitely.  KUMONGOUS. IS. IMPORTANT. negating your opponent's ability to activate effects and attack in this current META is the best thing you can do, it can and will cancel their combo's leaving them wide open. if you find yourself against an overly effect reliant deck such as sky-strikers, time lords or subterrors Kumongous can throw off their entrie strategy, and paired with Kyoutou Waterfront, is really self sustainable.  Be mindful when summoning Gameciel to your opponents side of the field. Yes, he is the weakest Kaiju monster stat wise but thats a balancing chip with him. If there are readily accesible kaiju counters while once you've summoned Gameicel its better to take him out first before going for any potentially game ending effects (like Dogoran's)."

Board Possibilities:  1) Simorgh Link, Apex Avian, Barrier Statute, Harpie's feather storm (extra simorgh monster to protect link if possible)  2) Simorgh Link, Dark Simorgh, Anti-Spell Fragrance, Harpie's feather storm (extra simorgh monster to protect link if possible)  Any mix of the above can be made if you have the extenders. Use the Simorgh spells to extra-normal summon Avian without tributing if you have it in your hand. You can also end on the other two big simorgh birds but they aren't as good. If you manage to get traptrick or harpie's feather storm in conjuction with either/both of dark simorgh+spell fragrance or avian+barrier statute, or both, your opponent will quit.  Only weakness if evenly matched. Save Apex Avian or Simorgh of Darkness's effect(s) for this. Link Simorgh makes them all immune to infinite impermanence, so for the most part traps that can be played directly from the hand aren't a threat despite normally being capable or circumventing the simorgh lock."

The newest Chaos Space can search both Photon Thrasher and Butterspy.

Now is a bad time for this deck. With Needlefibre combos dominating the format, it's way too risky to run a deck with little room for handtraps that wants to go second. On the other hand, I think the deck's fundamentals are actually really solid. Citadel synergizes with Train cards, the deck takes total advantage of broken Earth Machine support, you have great utility link and Xyz plays including True King of All Calamities of your own.  2x Machina Citadel are the main reason to play the Machina engine. Having one of these in the GY essentially gives your Super Dora a floating effect that wipes your opponent's board at spell speed 2 at a time of your choosing, and you want the second copy so you can loop 2 of them out of your gy. This guy is a good backup boss monster, and the center of Urgent Schedule otks.  2x Machina Metalcruncher give you some normal summons. These help make Calamities, which is easier than you'd think with Urgent Switchyard, Flying Pegasus, and Machina Redeployment alongside Machina Megaform and Machina Irradiator. They also search a train to your hand, which helps make rank 10s. These are just better than Night Express, but you need 1 Night Express to tutor with Switchyard, so I'm only running 2. Both of these could be 3, but space is tight.  1 each of Fortress, Irradiator, and Megaform. Fortress is actually kind of broken, the thing inherent summons itself multiple times a turn if you pitch it with Scrap Recycler. Because we have so many ways to search it, one is all you need, since you don't want multiples in your hand. It's also a good beatstick, which can float into Megaform if it's in your GY, and is hard to remove with monsters without taking a penalty. Irradiator and Megaform are a free Citadel, or really any Machina card you want (Citadel). This combo also helps to make your Xyz plays, and is easy with Redeployment.  For Trains we have 1 Night Express, and 2 Flying Pegasus, to grab with Switchyard. Flying Pegasus can be a good normal summon in its own right, and helps make those Xyz plays seem easy. There are also 3 each of Bullet Train and Freight Train, not much to say about these, they're the bread and butter of the train deck. You want 3 of each to find them with Metalcruncher, but I could see cutting a Freight Train for a Citadel.  3 Scrap Recycler are run, alongside engine requirements Scrap Golem, O-Lion, and Gizmek Orochi. Please don't ban O-Lion because Needlefibre and Auroradon are too good. Just ban Auroradon and Needlefibre, scraps did nothing wrong. You could run a huge Needlefibre combo out of here with Jet Synchron, but in testing I had trouble making a good Needlefibre combo that didn't use up space needed for Trains. It seems better to have more utility rather than focus on a single game plan everyone is preparing for anyways. The Scrap engine is still incredibly good, even going first it's a 1.5 card Apollousa with 4 negates, and Scrap Recycler sends all kinds of targets in this deck. These are also insane alongside Urgent Schedule and Machina Citadel going second. Orochi also helps make Dingirsu, and fun fact, with Megaform your can even put 3 materials on him some of the time.  I'm running 8 interactive cards, plus effectively 3 mystic mine, but none of them are handtraps. The goal is to go second and OTK, so we have cards that will help to break board in mind.  3 Jizikiru the Star Destroyer Kaiju are run. You could run Gamecial for Water Barrier Statue, or wind Kaijus even for Wind Barrier Statue, but you get the most synergy running Kaijus that are (sort of) trains. I've also got 3 Lightning Storm to help break boards and deal with Backrow, and 2 Dark Ruler No More so I don't autolose all the time going second. Not Otking is actually ok in this deck IMO, its grind game is still pretty good despite being a big dumb otk deck.  We've effectively got 3 Switchyard and 3 Mystic Mine thanks to 1 of each and 1 Terraforming and 1 Set Rotation. 3 of each while only using 4 deck spaces is the reason for this split - it uses as little deckspace as possible while still letting me run the numbers I want anyways. Mystic Mine can lock games down and facilitate Liebe or Borrelsword OTKs. Switchyard is an insane combo piece that virtually ensures you make a Rank 10.  There's not much to say about Urgent Schedule and Machina Redeployment. Urgent Schedule is an insane card in Machina AND trains, especially going second, and is just broken with Citadel and Recycler. Redeployment fixes your hand while pitching something to the GY, and finds combo pieces or way to Citadel in the process. In my opinion you must run 3 of each of these cards in the deck."

I liked the Popperup engine enough I dedicated a deck to it.,"Pretty simple deck, pure control Eldlich. We have 6 hand traps, 24 cards that combo with our card draw techs, and 9 of said techs, which are cards which can gain simply absurd advantage by pitching cards which we want in the GY to draw cards.  The card draw is the most important part. Magicians' Souls is the key engine piece of the deck, its ability to send cards from the hand or the GY makes it even better with Cursed Eldland than the other options. You're seeing things right, I'm normal summoning the sumbitch. Why not, the deck has no other normal summons anyways. Popperup is just an absurd card, a potential +6 if you ""combo"". Hand Destruction is a high risk - high reward option, since it greatly improves our own consistency since our deck is built around it, while it might actually disrupt an opponent relying on small combos and hand traps. Definitely pull these out in the mirror, though game 1 our deck is far better suited to take advantage of it than the average Eldlich build. With 9 of these the odds of seeing 1 in your opening hand is reasonably high.  24 cards are part of recursive grind engines. The only reason for 1 red Eldlixir is speculating on it being limited in the near future. Run 3 for sure while they're legal. All the Eldlich cards are here in full force, alongside Lost Wind, Titanocider, and the card advantage engine which is Metalfoes Fusion. You can use it as fodder for Golden Lord or the draw engine, all while drawing extra cards. 24 cards means nearly 2 of 3 cards will be cards the deck wants in the gy, alongside the 1 of 5 which can pitch it there (Golden Lord not included). You want all the Eldlich cards possible, since you'll often be throwing away copy 1.  6 hand traps means we will see them in just under 2/3 of all games, giving us a chance when going second game 1. The game plan going first is good enough we should only need them going second, but the deck could be punished for that. Imperm is particularly synergistic with Souls, and good right now, while Crow is too good to pass up even with 3 Huaquero.  Edit* Changed the numbers. Reduced recursion to fit in hand trap 7, running 3 red splatter while this is legal. Also running Pot of Extravagence. While it does lock you out of other draw for the turn, you aren't using your extra deck, and the card can be held on to in order to significantly improve your grind game, or be filtered through with your other draw engines."

I wanted to take advantage of the space in the deck to run 9 hand traps. 9 helps really ensure that we'll see a hand trap most of the time, and there just weren't other cards I considered essential enough. Nibiru is really good right now with all the combo running around, and Imperm and Crow are also really good against Eldlich and Adamancipator going first or second, so this split seems good. I'm not maining Dark Ruler, because IMO it's not good enough against Eldlich Synchron or against any deck with space for Jet Synchron combos/literally any 1 card Needlefibre. They're in the side deck for when a hand trap isn't as good or better.  We have 3 Deep Sea Diva and 3 Neptabyss with 3 Dragoons, 3 Minstrel, Lappis, and Moulinglacia. This means Diva ends on Moulinglacia + VFD having drawn 2 cards and hand looped our opponent for 3, with Neptabyss also making VFD + Draw 2. I cut the Formula Synchron combo to make space for some backup/followup plays in Bujinki Ahashima, Apollousa, and Bahamut Shark into Toad (running 3 cards just to draw a single card seemed excessive). 3 Heavy Infantry makes sense, since we go into Coral Drgon and Crocodragon as part of our main combo, and the potential to seriously break boards while comboing off is super clutch.  1 001 and 2 O-Lion are pretty key. 2 O-Lion is about always having an O-Lion to combo off with even if you brick, since the whole deck is pretty dedicated to comboing off one route.  3 Deep Sea Aria help find us any low-level sea Serpent, usually Diva, to start combos. The deck doesn't excel at putting monsters in the GY, but this card gives you 3 more situational copies of Diva, which is clutch. Pot of Avarice is at 3 which is insane, and I genuinely think more decks can play it. It contributes greatly to the grind game while also giving card advantage. While it might seem like a bit of a ""win more"" card, the truth is any deck that can easily put 5-10 monsters in the GY off of 1-2 cards should probably be running this. The card also isn't once per turn, which decks like this can take sometimes take advantage of (though not as well as Salamangreats, just sayin'). One for One is an extra Neptabyss, which is full combo, as is Abyssteus + Dragoons, which is what I like to call ""overcombo""."

Right now they serve well as a beast advantage engine, but still need a few more cards to have a chance of being meta-viable.  That isn't going to stop us. I'll level with you in advance; <strong>this is not a meta deck.</strong> It can't beat full-power Adamancipator or Eldlich. However, I've done my best to test and refine it and compare it to other Märfae deck variants, so <strong>this might just be the <em>most</em> meta-ready Märfae deck build</strong> you'll find on here, at least at the present moment. So let's get into the choices!  <span><em>- Playing Around With Märfaes: A Basic Primer -</em></span>  <strong>The essential idea of this deck</strong> is being able to make plays on both your own and your opponent's turn to keep a hold of the game. You'll be using effects like <em>Obedience Schooled</em> and <em>Ties of the Brethren</em> early game to establish a board, then using the recursion of your Märfae children to keep the advantage and disruption up later. You can go first or second; you'd rather go first, but you can adjust based on whether your opponent's playing OTKs or not.  The core gameplay options of this deck revolve around a triple threat of Extra Deck summoning mechanisms: using <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> as your premier Synchro, <strong>Märfaes of the Forest </strong>as your main Xyz play, and <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> as the core Link of the deck. These let you stun spells, disrupt monsters while obtaining advantage, and go into powerful game-ending plays respectively.  Each of the main Märfae monsters summons themselves from your hand during your End Phase, and can bounce themselves back to the hand when attacked or when your opponent summons, in order to activate a unique effect; <strong>Puppie</strong> summons a lv2 Beast from deck, <strong>Cathy</strong> gets any decked Beast to hand (notably, it can get Rescue Cat(!)), <strong>Fennie</strong> summons a Beast from your hand, and <strong>Ponie</strong> recycles a Beast from the Graveyard. We play an assortment of all of these - I originally ran only 1 each of Fennie and Ponie as their effects are mediocre, but quickly found that having multiple Märfae names accessible is useful as their effects are all hard once per turn.  Your main disruption options during the opponent's turn are as follows: <ul>  	<li><strong>Märfaes of the Forest</strong> Fiendish Chains an opponent whenever a Märfae returns to your hand, letting you freeze your opponent at critical moments as long as the foe's effect isn't an on-summon one.</li>  	<li><strong>Naturia Beast </strong>locks any deck that relies on Spells out of the game altogether, and lets you get monsters in your grave for later.</li>  	<li><strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong>will often be your Puppie/Fennie target of choice, popping any card the moment it hits the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Hop-Ear Squadron</strong> is a powerful Cathy target, as you can instantly Synchro Summon into a Herald or Hastorr the moment you add it.</li>  	<li><strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> is the ultimate culmination of your ""play on the foe's turn"" stratagem; it lets you utilise those Märfae self-bounce resource getters and their summon-at-end-phase to toolbox into <strong>Zeroboros, Borrelsword,</strong> or whatever other Link helps you solve the present problems.</li>  	<li>...and you've got plenty more convenient backrow support, such as old staples <strong>Called by the Grave and Ash Blossom</strong>, <strong>Märfae Tag</strong> for summoning, <strong>Super Rush Recklessly</strong> to yeet opposing threats right back to the deck, and even odd picks like <strong>Peropero Cerperus!</strong></li> </ul> <span><em>- Disowned by Märfae Mommie herself! -</em></span>  I'll address the elephant in the room while I can. <strong>This deck does not run <em>Märfae Mommie</em>, the second Xyz. It also does not run<em> Märfae Time</em>, the Trap.</strong> Why? <strong>First of all, I'm sorry, but Mommie is... not good.</strong> You have to expend 5 material to make her the best she can be, and that best is... a weaker Yubel with no effect protection. If I were playing Heroic Champion I could have solved world hunger by making a five material Xyz, so needless to say Mommie is not worth the investment.  <strong>This also means that Märfae Time isn't worth it</strong> - at best you're getting 1-2 bounces by expending materials from your Märfaes of the Forest, which isn't much advantage for a slow trap. Märfaes simply have better ways to interact on their opponent's turn, as the above proves!  Cutting both of these has given us much more room to focus on cards that do matter, as this deck is pretty short on both main and extra deck room. Pragmatism never hurt anybody!  <span><em>- Interactions and choices to keep in mind -</em></span>  First of all: <strong>Search stoppers like Ash Blossom are a pretty big threat to this deck.</strong> Most of your ways to go off on your own turn such as Ties/Rescue/Obedience are blocked out by it, and though it's not uncommon that you'll draw into two or more of those, it's still something to keep in mind. You've got three Called to help cover yourself on that regard, but if that ever feels like it's not enough for a particular matchup, feel free to splurge on those Three Tactical Talents in the side deck!  Related to that; you don't have too many cards that lock you into specific conditions, but <strong>Obedience and Ties lock you</strong> into <em>only Beasts and no more Special Summoning respectively.</em> Obedience, therefore, is best when you don't want to go for I:P, and instead want to make an opening board of something like Forest + Puppie + Natbeast with a bunch of backrow and card advantage ready. Ties's limitation is less of a problem; you're not doing it to gain material, you're using it to get two more Märfaes from deck to field so you can proceed to pop off with Masqs and Kalantosas and Hopears and the like on your foe's turn! Use them wisely and you can't go wrong!  On another note, <strong>what you should search with Märfaes of the Forest depends on the situation.</strong> <em>Hide-And-Seek</em> is a powerful one; giving a single effect protection per turn is surprisingly useful and lets you do amusing actions like keep the material you got from Rescue Cat, while it also lets you constantly recycling all the monsters you're going to be getting time and time again to get free hand advantage. I can't count the number of times in practice I shuffled back the exact three cards of Mine Mole, Valerifawn, and Naturia Beast, or thereabouts, to proc it... <em>Märfae Tag</em> is also a powerful option that lets you do stuff like surprise proc'ing an I:P-made Zeroboros to clear your opponent's field, but if you don't need any of them, <em>Puppie</em> (or whatever best Märfae you don't have on hand at the time) is always a safe bet.  Finally, just remember that <strong>the Extra Deck and Side Deck for this deck are by no means locked in stone.</strong> There's a lot of different picks you can take, from different rank 2 Xyz, different Link toolboxing, et cetera. The side deck right now just reflects a few tools that might be useful - Barkion helps a lot in trap-centric matchups but is hard to make, Cerburrel works well with cards like Valerifawn and Twin Twisters <em>(if you feel lucky, you can even run a Danger! variant of the deck with Bigfoot and Jackalope) </em>and lets you make Unicore for a very unique stun option, and so forth. Definitely experiment to make the deck suit your own tastes!  <span><em>- Final Thoughts -</em></span>  Ultimately, the Märfae archetype is a very unique and thematic deck lineup that has a surprising amount of depth and flexibility to their play and has potential to become all the more powerful if more support is released from them in the future. From churning out advantage to going for unexpected kills with link 4s, there's a lot they can show off, and I hope this has convinced you to take a stroll in the forest yourself and try them out!"

In this build, I decided to run 10 field searchers and 3 Boss Stage, which are about 88% to open with them in the starting hand.  Basically the field is 1 card Spell Speed 2 banish removal, effect negation, and summon negation during your opponent's turn, but it loses to any kind of Spell Speed 2 spell/trap removal. So I decided to run the Jet Synchron Auroradon package to provide some protection for the field and provide some more disruption.  P.S. English isn't my first language.

They all have an effect that tributes a monster to be a D.D. Crow or Monster or Spell and Trap negation. This is a going-second version of the deck.  The idea is to play as little normal summons as possible to maximize the amount of mills on Monster Gate. Lair of Darkness is a great support card, allowing you to once per turn tribute your opponent's monsters to activate your effects. You can take out Dark Ruler No More for any going-second card you'd like, such as Evenly Matched, Lightning Storm, Infinite Impermanence, etc."

Possibly my most generic build.,"While I like the grind game of the Turbo Control build, I also like comboing off, so I'm back on Synchros for a second. I still plan to play the control variant, which has a lot of advantages, such as space to run 9 card draw, the advantage of running 3 each of Golden Land Traps, and generally puts more interactions on the board with its spell and trap line-up than the Synchro version, which can often be dead in the water if your Needlefibre gets hand trapped. On the other hand, some percentage of the time you can win just by comboing off of 1 card, and the deck is uniquely suited to take advantage of the Jet Synchron engine, and in my opinion, the Synchro deck is better in most matchups for that reason alone."

Mystic Mine may seem counterintuitive at first but aids tremendously in stalling the opponent during situations where Toon Kingdom has been removed off the field and in circumstances where activating this card may genuinely help replenish the hand and circumvent the duel. Toon World is used during situations where the opponent has already swarmed several monsters and is used in conjunction with Mystic Mine to achieve plays (particularly with Toon Black Luster Soldier whose banishing properties help cripple the opponent's field slowly.) Pot of Extravagance and Reckless Greed aids in providing the deck the necessary draw power.  On the other hand, Waking The Dragon helps in surprising the opponent and stunning them (such as with Bagooska) or simply making it more difficult for the opponent to deal with the field (such as with Raidraptor-Ultimate Falcon). All the other cards are pretty standard. The real player, however, in the deck, isn't really Mystic Mine or even Toon Kingdom though, as There Can Be Only One pretty much fuels the deck's control power strangely enough (being one of the few decks that can make genuine use of it actually helps it a lot.) If Mystic Mine ever gets banned lol there's still a lot of interesting options to choose from.  &nbsp;"

Aroma jar will funnel you life while also staying on the field and having battle protection, and Effect Veiler, Star Pendulumgraoh and Time Pendulumgraph will give you protection from almost anything if you set it up right. Secret Village also gives you spell protection, and the two Magician's Hands give you S/T protection. Now I know the new cards have come out, but I didn't add those. So yeah, that's it.  Credit to MagicMike for making the deck, all I did was think up the strats."

Yes, Romulus equals to infinite negates, making Channeler, Perfumer, and Rescue Rabbit a 1 card Mist Valley lock. H","Romulus turbo deck, it means any 2 dragons/winged beasts are enough to fuel the combo. So we play 3 Channeler, 3 Perfumer, and 3 Rescue Rabbit as our main starter because it makes our Feather Storm online to prevent Nibiru and other monster handtrap while still can summon Romulus. Use Romulus add Divine Lance, use Divine Lance, equip and ss Phalanx, make Linkross using Romulus ss 2 tokens, make Halqifibrax using Linkross + Phalanx and ss O-Lion, make Martial Metal Marcher, use Martial ss O-Lion/Phalanx (Phalanx better, so enemy's D.D. Crow wont give us -2 card advantage) chain O-Lion ss token, make Union Carrier using Mecha Phantom Beast token + Martial, make og Clausolas using O-Lion/Phalanx + Linkross token, make Simorgh link 3 using Clausolas + Halq.  This deck will be even better once the new Dragunity support come, because you can easily make Dragunity Areadbhair + Herald Arc Light + Black Garden (prevent opponent from atking Arc Light), all just from a single Romulus too (by switching to Auroradon instead of using Simorgh/Clausolas). We will still have follow up because Garden Rose Maiden can revive Areadbhair and you can even summon Dragunity Arma Gram/Dragunity Glow (searchable by Romulus) if you have it in hand. I dont use Harpie synchro as it is a combo deck, it means we wont be running that much option to trigger its effect as interruption.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/4/42/MaiValentine-DULI.png/257px-MaiValentine-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Ultra consistent, minimal resource, have Nibiru (or other handtrap) prevention, follow up play is okay-ish, big space for staples.  Cons: Infinite negates is only once/twice per chain, it means your opponent can break the cycle by interrupting it mid-chain."

The main normal summon is the Kaleido Chick, and it can be searched or summoned from the deck in a variety of ways like the Tenki or the grave effects of the Perfume and the Serenade Dance.  Fusion spells are also easy to get to with the Black Sheep and Yellow Martin (Both of which are just as searchable as the Kaleido Chick).  The Dark Ruler No More and the Twin Twisters are just a couple cards that can help going second, but they can be replaced by other cards that you think may help you."

It also has the capability of looking into an opponent's deck with the chance of removing a card from the other players' hand giving it a Millenium Eye ""Mind Scan"" effect. I will be modifying it later, but as a warning, this is a 1 first turn deck meaning that this version has to go first.  Toon Gemini Elf can exist before Toon World or Kingdom is played. Like all toons monsters, it has the ability to attack your opponents directly.  You also want to try and banish any key cards a player has with the trap cards, Trickstar Reincarnation and Chain Dissappearance. Reincarnation will disrupt plays by banishing any monster, spell, or traps they could play in their hand. Chain Dissappearance will only banish all copies of the monster that has 1000 atk or lower. The Forceful Checkpoint allows to you send a monster from the hand to the grave after negating their attack.  Crackdown, Heartfelt Appeal and Comic Hand allows you to take your opponent's monsters and use them as you see fit given you are able to hit the right targets.  Then there's the usual protection of Solemn Counter trap cards. However it's at the cost of your own LP.  I do have other cards in mind to add it on for the future. Just got to make it more wackier than usual!"

If Accesscode Talker was removed from the field during the previous turn, another one could be brought out again easily if you could summon 2 monsters on the field. This is very easy to do since all of the Effect Monsters in the Main Deck revolve around Special Summons and Tokens; the opponent would have to burn at least two negates in order to break your combo in most cases, even more if you have a good hand.  Mathmech Addition and Mathmech Subtraction are also great options, especially in baiting your opponent's once per turn negates (e.g. Cyber Dragon Infinity). However, I did not include them in this iteration because there were other options that could synergize well with Lady Debug and Cyberse Gadget, or at least that's what I thought."

Turn 1 deck with strong turn 2 options. Extending into Snowdrop early, to enable early big bodies for your board. Mardel fishes for things you need on hand. Boss Stage. Primula. [Multiple Primulas can summon at once, seeing the effect can only trigger once]. Hiding things in the GY for later plays. Rose Girl for constantly recurring itself with Petal when you need recovery. Pot of Avarice to help recycle Snowdrop and Mardel for later use. Loptr is a Turn 1 insurance card. He makes sure you have something defensive to play. Brings out Mardel, who then lets you hand pick a card from the deck whether its a plant or Generaider card. Buffs any tokens that were brought out by Boss Stage.  Trying to tweak this into something that can better and consistently deal with/handle Altergeist.  EDOPro sucks... Don't use it. EDOPro sometimes registers Primula's effect to special summon herself as Snowdrops effect to tribute a plant by then locking out Snowdrop from using her own effect. So, use Dueling Book or hand test yourself.  Definitely, not the best deck. FOR NOW! With the play-testing online and IRL I have been having fun with this deck and I will continue to evolve this deck, hopefully, into something more competitive. I find the spell card Rikka Flurries is way more powerful than it's current consideration and should be a card to keep your eye on."

So I thought I will try tweaking the list a bit to fit Ultramafus while still making it consistent. This list was meant to downgrade Guru control from tier 2.5 to tier 3 in hopes of getting fun and not being called a meta fag by summoning Ultramafus turn 3 and aprove dominance by making Ultramafus 3.5-5k atk and OTK your opponent turn 3 or 5 ...  This deck is a go first deck and your God hand and go first tactic is basically Guru control and then turn 3 try swinging for big damage or control even moar.  These are the important cards you want to always see are Hidden City, Fiendess, Guru, Called/Ash/Imperm, and Final Battle/Trap Trick. These are the cards you don't want to see when going first is Nemesis Archer.  If you go first but see no Guru or Hidden City but have Fiendess, Ultramafus or Umastryx, and Final Battle or Trap Trick do the following play: Norma Summon Fiendess, Fiendess eff, Ultramafus or Umastryx, set Final Battle. If you have Called and Imperm set it, it is better than doing nothing.  You could also replace Necrovalley for Mystic Mine but to me it is riskier to play Mystic Mine because you have a limited options than to play against an opponent who plays Gravekeeper's.  &nbsp;"

This deck has a few combos that add up to a big one. I will put the 3 main combos here: 1-Cards needed = 1 HERO monster and 1 Vision HERO Faris in hand.  Combo: Discard the HERO to SS Faris, Faris eff will put Increase into the ST. then Increase will send Faris to GY to SS itself from the ST and Vion from the deck, then Vion will send a HERO from deck to GY, then banish Farris w Vion eff to add Polymerization. 2-Cards needed = 2 HERO monsters on field and Malicious on GY. Combo. Link summon into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader, Cross eff will revive the Malicious, then Cross will tribute the Malicious to search a HERO, then Malicious eff will SS banish itself from GY and SS a Malicious from deck. Then u can either link summon into Wonder Driver or Dread Deimator, or fusion summon. 3-Cards needed = 2 HERO monsters w different atributes + poly. This is a simple 2 fusion summon combo. u fuse into Sunrise then use its eff to add Miracle fusion to your hand, then play miracle fusion.  To get a big combo just do combos 1, 2, and 3 together. There are more combos that end up with better boards but figure that out for yourself.  P.S:The Field spells and Favorite hero cards are optional and can be replaced by handtraps."

Jizukiru and Thunder King, however, will power up your Relinquished/Restricts above the 3000 ATK threshold.</li>  	<li>Lava Golem, meanwhile, eats two monsters at the cost of your normal summon. This isn't always a safe choice, because both Manju and the Predaplant engine rely on your normal summon.</li>  	<li>Consider running a second Darlingtonia Cobra, because Garnets suck.</li>  	<li>Illusionist Faceless Magician gives longevity to an Eyes Restrict monster summoned by Instant Fusion (or the effect of Instant Fusion, copied by Anaconda).</li>  	<li>Perhaps it goes without stating, but the GY effect of Relinquished Fusion should be reserved for Millennium-Eyes Restrict whenever possible. It's the only monster of this archetype which has no native monster steal effect; only through Relinquished Fusion and Millennium-Eyes Illusionist can you use it proactively.</li>  	<li>The side deck contains only suggestions—I wouldn't recommend that exact side deck, but I would recommend any of those cards as options.</li> </ul>"

It's your boy, TheDeathMachine here, coming to you with my new Cyber Dragon deck profile! I call it ""K/DA - Kill Die Arise!"" And here's why. It's <em>DEFENITELY</em> not because K-Pop stans are threatening to drive by my house! Eheheh...  &nbsp;  About a week ago, I found a music video on League of Legends's official YouTube channel, in which the K-Pop group K/DA sang their song, POP/STARS. In fact, they also preformed it live in the opening ceremony of the LoL World Championship in 2018. To quote LongBeachGriffy, ""THIS! SH*T! IS! FIAAAAAAH!"" I loved the song so much, it actually inspired me to make this deck. The reason why I chose Cyber Dragons in particular was because of the neon/techno themes in the music video. I'll be posting the links to both down below.  POP/STARS Music Video: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4</a>  POP/STARS Live Performance: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oDlvOV3qs&amp;t=54s</a>  &nbsp;  Kill Die Arise! functions just like a normal Cyber Dragon deck would; your goal is to go second and lay the smackdown on your opponent. To help ensure this, KDA! has 3 copies of Power Bond and Lightning Storm in the Main Deck, while also running Side Deck options like the oh-so hated Dragun of Red-Eyes. That being said, please enjoy OTKing your opponent to the sound of K-Pop!"

I play that Deck myself in real life (and I love it) since it came out, so I have some Experience with it. The Main Strategy is always the same, but the Tech-options can vary a lot. I always try new Techs/Strategys, but I found this list very good so far. At my local Store I made second Place with it ( It´s a while ago, so I had some other  Cards in my Side Deck, but the Side Deck Choice is always different depending on the format, so...). With this Deck you want to go first, to set up everything you need. Goal is to summon Zerrziel (Link 3 Monster) equipped with Selene and Summon Limit, or There can be only one. Those Traps shut down so many Decks and it makes it much more easier for you.  There can be only one also restrict yourself, but to be Honest you just need one Monster (Serziel or Zerrziel) and having only one Dark Monster on the Field forces the opponent to use his Monsters when attempting to use Super Polymerization. Those Traps also increase the pressure on the opponent, because they have to deal with two spell/traps that threatening them. To make sure your Selene or the Traps don´t get destroyed or banned set the Evil Eye Countertrap. Only use that for the mentioned spell/trap removal. Protecting your Selene is very important. When you go into the second game you could side in another Evil Eye Countertrap or something similar. One major Plus point of this Deck is, that nearly no one knows this Deck and underestimates it. Most times those opponents loose the Game^^ I play this Deck quite a while now and I have to say that the worst Thing that can happen to this Deck is getting Kaiju-ed. In every other case the opponent first has to deal with the Selene and then with the Monster so he/she has to put some (Card-) material to it, which reduces his/her Cards. When you get Kaiju-ed you loose everything without the possibility to react to it. So in my Opinion it is absolutely mandatory to have Mask of Restrict in the side Deck especially for game two. Getting out Zerrziel (Link 3) first turn is very easy with Tour Guide. You special summon Catoblepas, the summon Gorgon (Link 2), the special summon Catoblepas from the Grave and then go into Zerrziel. You then also have one Evil Eye Card in your Graveyard that you can banish for Evil Eye Repose (if you have it in Hand) without disadvantage. With Ghost Sister you have to be careful, because when you didn´t get any life points through this, you loose half your life points, which is a bad Thing in a Deck relying on Lifepoint-paying. It is a very good Handtrap in this Deck because sometimes you really need that Life Point-recovery. When I use it, then as follows: 1. Only when it is worth it. What I mean with this is: Some Decks can clear your Board and easily kill you in that same Turn. So if you see that is such a Deck or a Deck that special summons a lot (especially Monsters with high ATK) you should use it. Because sometimes an Opponent stops further summons to prevent giving you such a high amount of Life Points. 2. Only when he activates a Card or effect that would special summon a Monster, because the you are safe that you get Life points with it (except he can special summon a Monster with 0 ATK and ends it there. This is very rare but I had that case once, so just keep it in Mind^^). The cards in the Side Deck are only one possibility.  My Main Deck except a hand full of cards mostly stays the same, but the Side Deck is always Changing. That said you can exchange everything to your own Playstyle. The only card that I would highly recommend you to play in the Side Deck is Mask of Restrict. When you get Kaiju-ed and the opponent doesn´t have a Brick or has a slow Deck you will probably loose the game.  So, now I wrote a lot and I will end this now. I could say something to every card choice and the chosen number of them and talk about some plays that you can do with different Hands, but that would be too much for here. I should recommend doing a Video about it^^  I´m always open to new Ideas, so if you have some Tips or interesting Ideas please leave a comment. I would love to here some other opinions. Thanks for being interested in this Deck and have fun playing and building it."

Two Sacred Beasts with their total of 8000 attack points are impeccable in terms of offense and defence. <em>Fallen Paradise</em> offers protection and card draw. Gathering all these cards on board can be achieved even in the first turn depending on your starting hand. I aimed to make it consistent as possible. Even partially completing this combo is pretty strong. If all fails, you can resort <strong><em>Armityle the Chaos Phantom </em></strong>to deal a huge blow to your opponent. ***EDITS BY ME*** **Remove** 2x Twin Twisters, 1x Raviel, 1xHamon, 1x Foolish Burial, 1x Jar of Avarice. **ADD** 2X Allure of Darkness, 1x Called(designator) from the grave, 1x Unending Nightmare, 2x Crackdown (manhunt)."

","Unicore going to 3 got me looking at Nekroz. The Deskbot 003 combo seemed really good on paper, but it doesn't play under Nibiru, which is really common in this meta, and it also incorporates a huge number of bricks for a combo card you can only run 3 copies of, since there's no rota for 003. Unicore next to Kristya is also a little redundant, and I feel it's not a great use of its power. It's definitely a good combo, which I might be inclined towards, but I feel like to truly take advantage of the Nekroz deck you should play it sort of like Invoked Shaddoll last format, and turbo out Nekroz of Unicore.  In the main deck we get 9 ROTAs, all of which find us either a Ritual spell or monster. 3x Manju of the Ten Thousand hands uses up our normal summon for this, but the deck is not normal summon reliant, since you are a ritual deck. Extra-Foolish Burial is either a Rota by sending Herald of the Arc Light or targeted removal by sending Elder Entity N'tss. Both of these cards are useful Kaleidoscope targets, so the cost for this is a measly 400o LP. Preparation of Rites recycles a Ritual spell while adding a ritual monster that's level 7 or lower, but because of Clausolas and Brionac you can grab either a Nekroz spell or Monster. Having 12 ways to find Unicore and 11 ways to search a ritual spells, plus the actual copies of each in your deck makes turboing out Unicore very plausible.  We're only running 1 Shurit. He makes higher level Nekroz monsters more plausible and is still an important 1 of, but the deck has literally a dozen ways to search him thanks to all the ROTAs.  For Nekroz Ritual Monsters, 3 Unicore is obligatory. The secondary effect is very useful, and unlike some of his peers he can be full material for himself, so multiple copies are fine and you want to see this card. The whole point of the deck is turboing this onto the field and seeing if your opponent can play through him. It's notable that Eldlich outs him very easily, with 6 copies of Golden Lord, even with other Nekroz cards backing Unicore up. This played into my card choices.  I'm also running 3 Brionac. This is an essential combo piece with Preparation of Rites, also it finds Clausolas which finds rituals spells, and its 3 MORE copies of Unicore. The goal is as much consistency as possible, so 3 seemed ideal. It also really helps going second to break boards, which makes this deck good going second as well as first. Yay!  2 Nekroz of Clausolas helps make Preparation of Rites search either spells or monsters, contributing to that whole ""12 Rota"" feel. Effect negation on the board is occasionally good, like against Zombies, still kind of a deck, or uhh... Maybe Toons? Not a lot of maindeck archetypes right now besides Eldlich, which also activates effects out of the hand and GY anyways.  2 Nekroz of Trish are basically hand traps that are searchable by all of our 12 Rotas, which do the Sauravis thing. Having played Vanity stun, the power of that is immediately obvious. Also, while the deck can find it hard to summon sometimes thanks to Extravagence, it has a great effect going second to 3 for 2 your opponent. This card is the real reason you need Shurit.  2 Nekroz of Valkyrus round off the hand traps. This one is the easiest of all of the high-level Nekroz monsters to summon, and can gain you card advantage going first, especially in combination with Manju. Its real purpose is to protect Unicore from destruction by battle, very relevant against Eldlich, or against any deck with high attack monsters you can summon in the main deck.  2 Cycle, 2 Kaleidoscope, and 1 Mirror round off the Ritual spells. All of these are good, but with 11 searchers for them and 5 copies you should be good on seeing these in your hand.  I'm running 3 Pot of Extravagance, which can hurt with Kaliedoscope sometimes, but generally is worth if for sheer card advantage. Its also good Ash bait in a deck that needs searchers, and may be better than Called by the Grave for getting your plays going against Ash, which is still seeing some play as a 2 of.  That left room for 10 hand traps, and I wanted to take full advantage of it. To me, being able to run 10 interactive cards was the main perk of playing this version of the deck. I focused on cards that would help against Eldlich in the main deck, since the Eldlich matchup is seriously rough, but in the side deck I have options for, Adamancipator, as well as various ways to board against combo and control, including spicier versions of Eldlich and Altergeist, which are both actually pretty good right now (I know Geist is a rogue deck, but it was still topping with 1 Multifaker and now it has 3), plus going second cards.  The only things in the extra deck besides Kaleidoscope targets, including some which double for Extra-Foolish Burial, is Eria Gentle into Accesscode. This lets us imitage Shaddolls even further, by increasing the decks potential to OTK (when it doesn't see Extravagence).  ***EDIT***  Added original flavour ROTA over an interaction slot. Through Clausolas it is the 12th spell rota, and the 13th Shurit Rota. Basically a better flex slot when I decided to add Shurit #2.  ***EDIT***  Added I Shaddoll Dragon main and 3 Shaddoll Apkallone to the extra deck. This lets us make Brionac to break boards more easily, while also popping an additional spell/trap. It's worth losing 1 Cyclone for this mini engine, since Dragon is also useful for popping spells/traps with Nekroz Rituals, and 1 copy can be recycled to pop more cards with Apkallone."

Puppets have no reason for that.,"After seeing Shaddolls come to the scene with all its competitive variations, I researched how to make this deck viable in other ways. This deck gets its name for the amount of cards that help with drawing or adding cards to the hand. Establishing a board has never been easier when using this deck. Personally, I never liked  the Shaddoll Deck, but with this build, it has made me loved it.  Incorporation of the Spellbook engine to the core of the Shaddoll Deck was the best decision to make with this deck."

Crow and Called by the Grave as you were with 1 Multifaker. You now have 3 copies of the heart of your Deck, and with new F &amp; L Lists seeing use in online competitive events (like the PPG Circuit's custom ban list) there has not been a better time to pick up Altergeist. _________  <strong>Key Altergeist Cards:</strong>  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a>: The engine that makes Altergeist work, Multifaker is critical to the snowballing of the Deck as a whole with its ability to get you to cards like Silq, for disruption, and Meluseek, for more advantage.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Meluseek"">Altergeist Meluseek</a>: A key piece in getting to your Fakers, and other Altergeist monsters (like Marionetter) down the line, Meluseek is also a versatile tool with its battle oriented removal effect.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Marionetter"">Altergeist Marionetter</a>: Inevitably you'll find yourself with some awkward faker-less hands, and when those hands creep up... the next best thing is Mari. With the ability to set Protocol or Manifestation, she can keep you alive during your next turn and even provide some much-needed interaction via Protocol. Aside from her Normal Summon effect, she also has another powerful effect. Mari's ability to send an Altergeist card to the GY to revive an Altergeist from the grave is incredibly powerful in the mid-late game, netting you additional Altergeist bodies.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Silquitous"">Altergeist Silquitous</a>: While it's not great to open, this card is undeniably important to the Deck's core strategy. Being a Quick Effect bounce is already really, really good. When you add the fact that this card can function as pre-errata Brionac for the Deck... it becomes even more insane. This card can not only bounce your opponent's cards to the hand, it returns your Altergeist Traps and monsters back to the hand for a 2-in-1 disruption, as you're also gaining future setup (i.e. setting up Faker again, getting another Marionetter set, getting multiple uses out of Kunqueary). Adding to its impressive repertoire of ability is yet another effect. If this card is sent to the GY, whether it be as Link Material or byway of interaction with your opponent, Silq can grab an Altergeist Trap from the grave.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Kunqueary"">Altergeist Kunqueary</a>: While nowhere near as consistently impactful as the rest of its brethren, Kunq can be pivotal in winning some matchups. Its ability to stop attacks, that is not once per turn, coupled with its on-summon negation can prove to be too much for some Decks.  • <a data-name=""Personal Spoofing"">Personal Spoofing</a>: Though it's not ""technically an Altergeist card"", it wouldn't be right to exclude spoofing from this list. Not only is it an additional 3 copies of Faker, and not only is it able to <em>trigger faker on its own</em> when activated... it can get you a whole host of other Altergeist monsters. Access to Kunq during your opponent's turn or Meluseek/Mari during yours are just some of the benefits this card can provide.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Protocol"">Altergeist Protocol</a>: Likely your first set off Mari, Protocol is the 2nd inherent piece of disruption within the archetype - after Silq. On top of being a monster negate, that pops, it also has a nifty effect that prevents the activation of Altergeist effects. That's pretty absurd given how powerful some of the effects of the Altergeist lineup are, and this card is pretty handy given how many boss-caliber monsters exist in today's format (of which some are incredibly hard to out via monster effects).  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Manifestation"">Altergeist Manifestation</a>: Though it may not be as impressive as some of the other Altergeist cards, Mani definitely has a place within the group. With cards like Silq and Protocol, you're able to abuse Manifestation's unique design to get free reborns on either turn in addition to getting your Mani back to Deck or hand. These reborns can prove to be crucial as you may not have a Multifaker on field, or a Silq left in Deck to bounce with.  _________  <strong>Options to consider for Extra/Main/Side</strong>  Aside from ratio adjustments, there are a few cards that should be considered when building Altergeist.  • Extra Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>: It's able to trigger off your Hexstia, which will probably be even more relevant once turn 1 Hexstia becomes reality with the release of Altergeist Pookuery, and it's able to set up some Link 2 plays (assuming Linkuriboh is in your GY).</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>: It's still amazing all these years down the line. It's hard to out, it has the ability to remove some of the game's most annoying monsters, and it's pretty big. There's not much more you can ask for from Borreload, the issue is that it's not as fast or as impactful as some of the Extra Deck's other options (see Borrelsword &amp; Accesscode).</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Altergeist Primebanshee"">Altergeist Primebanshee</a>: Another Altergeist name that you may end up wanting if you manage to banish your 3 Hexstia. However this card's actual impact is debatable as Altergeist is not reliant on its Extra Deck... and this card's only real place is as another name.</p> • Main Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>: Needlefiber does exist in the TCG alongside Linkross, Verte Anaconda, and Union Carrier. Given the power and prevalence of Link 2+ monsters in the TCG format, it is definitely worth it to consider this card.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> / <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcaster"">Secret Village of the Spellcaster</a>s / <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> / <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> / <a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>: I'm putting a whole host of cards together because they all go together (though you do not have to play all together). If you opt to play a more Mystic Mine centered variant, as it has proven to be successful (see Gabriel Netz's 1st place LCS list), it's also pretty reasonable to invest Deck space into cards like Demise of the Land as well.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> / <a data-name=""Typhoon"">Typhoon</a>: Given the prevalence of Eldlich, and the rise of <em>Altergeist</em>, Storm Duster &amp; Typhoon might be worth playing in the main Deck instead of Side. They're Normal Traps, so they can trigger your Multifaker and be set off <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>, while removing threats in your opponent's backrow.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>: It's similar to <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a>, but you get to keep the opponent's monster.</p> <p>-&gt; Trap Trick: If you opt to play a higher Normal Trap Count this card is fantastic (it can get you Infinite Impermanence, maybe a <a data-name=""Different Dimension Ground"">Different Dimension Ground</a> or even a Compulse).</p> • Side Deck: <p>-&gt; Kaijus / <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: Same reason for why <a data-name=""Sphere Mode"">Sphere Mode</a> is in the Side. Altergeist isn't entirely reliant on its Normal Summon and it can't clear a break-my-board type of field if it DRNMs, <em>and</em> these cards are amazing at doing exactly that.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>: It's great in the mirror, versus Salamangreat, and a whole host of other strategies. It clears backrow or Attack Position monsters, and doesn't care if you have a bunch of set traps.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> / <a data-name=""Different Dimension Ground"">Different Dimension Ground</a>: For the more GY based strategies, these cards are great options.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: It hits Eldlich, it hits TCG Adamancipators, and it can hit rogue options like Thunder. Overall it's still a great option for Decks that banish to progress their gameplan.</p>"

Main combo starters are <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>. Both can setup at least one <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> plus some additional link and xyz fodder. When focusing on the rank 9 xyz plays, try to use <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a> as material as often as possible because its not banished when you detach it so you can bring it back multiple times (even in the opponents turn to pop a card).  Still testing around with extra and side deck, so please let me know any card that you think might miss."

Not only that, they can also pops card along the way. I chose earth, because its the best one so far cus it summons back its material means you can Halq if you used tuner as that beast fodder. The Halq combo we use is without Linkross (banned in OCG) and Borreload Savage (useless if summoned from Ascator package, I'll explain why Ascator package later) while maintaining at least 2 different attribute on field so our Teamwork of the Possessed extra effect is online.  Ascator package is used as it is a free Awakened-Possessed fodder and can go to lv8 synchro means you will have 2 disruptions online despite the synchro only restriction. Magicians Souls package works wonder too as it is an Awakened-Possessed fodder and can dump Gravekeeper's Shaman (1500 def spellcaster with gy lock, super good in meta matchup). Eda the Sun Magician (spellcaster, earth, 1500 def, all stats fits just perfectly) works okay-ish as it brings free monster from deck (Green Turtle Summoner, flip and pops monster, water for Eria link targeting opponent Halq for instant Accesscode). For earth extender, we use tuners like Adhara and Deskbot 001 (combo pieces). Instant Fusion is versatile on bringing which fodder we lack. Paleozoic Dinomischus is just great normal trap in general (removes Golden Lord permanently if given the chance), it makes Teamwork of the Possessed extra effect online cus it summons a water monster (giving that we dont summon the 1500 def water spellcaster), also it is a water for Eria. Trap Trick to fetch all the normal trap we play. The handtrap lineup is preferably tuner, and is an earth and/or spellcaster (ghost belle and veiler).  Extra deck we're using Draco Berseker instead of Borrel Savage cus its viable without link in gy. Linkuriboh + Secure Gardna is there to provide attribute variant for Teamwork of the Possessed (also it provides link 1 for Borrel Savage if you wanna use it). Selene + Accesscode good in late game as we run bunch of spellcasters (but only a handful of spell tho).  Side deck, Kaiju is the first thing to use cus it provides attribute you desire with using Slumber while breaking board (this deck has slow removal, trap, so we need faster removal going second). Scarlight is another great lv8 option via Ascator going second. Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched as faster removal too.  Cards to think of: Block Dragon is good but it requires you to run rocks for full advantage, at that point why not play adaman instead haha. Fossil Fusion lineup maybe good, but Weathering Soldier wont trigger if it's used as Awakened-Possessed fodder. The field spell is very gimmicky, because while its nice to have monster negation, it is mandatory and needs 1500 stats spellcaster it means most of the time it wont negate handtraps if we're on further Halq combo, the adding earth monster is bad too as the spellcasters are better than those 1500/200 earths.  &nbsp;  Pros: Fun to play (except the Halq part lol). Playstyle has multiple variant, call it backrow or combo. First turn board is okay-ish.  Cons: Struggle going second (almost guaranteed lose going second cus some of our play is flip monster or trap)."

Keep in mind that this deck is still a work in progress. My main goal with this deck is creating an aggressive Dark Magician deck that puts pressure on your opponent and forces them to waste resources.

Here is a beginners guide tho, for everyone who has no idea what either toons or control decks are about.  <em>*Always use bookmark to search kingdom, otherwhise search bookmark with table of contents, because bookmark gives protection for the kingdom and the kingdom is kinda important for the deck to work.</em>  <em>*Don't search Table of Contents, with Table of Contents! There is no reason to deck thin in a toon deck.</em>  <em>*Only attack with BLS if you swing for game, removal is worth more in most cases.</em>  <em>*When you go first, there is no reason to select BLS as a summoning option for Page-Flip, select DM, Red-eyes and Masked Sorcerer.</em>  <em>*When you can special a toon, you usually do it in defense, because they can't attack anyways in most cases and it protects from Utopia Double.</em>  <em>*Use DM to search Terror, Briefcase or to special BLS (or Red-eyes when BLS is in hand). </em>  <em>*Bookmark can search Comic hand, but NOT Briefcase, keep that in mind because you will often have Bookmark+Table of Contents in your hand.</em>  <em>*Comic hand helps to swing for game.</em>  <em>*If you didn't quite make game with attacking, just use Crackdown or Comic hand to grab opponents monsters for a cowboy, or special Cannon soldier from deck with DM.</em>  <em>*Attack with masked sorcerer first to see your options after the draw.</em>  <em>*Don't use floodgates if not necessary! You don't want to be locked in on Summon limit or Tcboo against sky striker.</em>  <em>*Against Meta decks you wait and use Crackdown on essential combo pieces, like jet synchron, aleister, golden lord or an adamcipator tuner. Against rough decks you can use crackdown on the normal summon. In a lot of cases it ends their turn.</em>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The goal was to flex somewhere between the combo version and the straight Winda Turbo version, and running a lot of very specific interaction pieces to try and combat the format.  I wanted room for at least 9 interaction in the deck, to increase the odds of seeing a hand-trap. However, I also felt that Called By The Grave was essential for Eldlich the Golden Lord, which natively outs Winda. It seems like the matchup against Eldlich is super rough, so I wanted to run cards that were good against Eldlich or Adamancipator. With Eldlich heavy on the combo build and most decks incorporating a Needlefibre Package, Nibiru seemed like an obvious pick, particularly since it is a light monster. I went with D.D. Crow over Effect Veiler, mostly because it helps make Winda in a pinch, but also to snipe Golden Lords out of the GY while still stopping or stalling Adamancipator combos.  The Invoked engine is obligatory. These cards are very powerful, and have huge synergy in the fusion deck. 3 of all of them, and Terraforming to search Meltdown. After that its pretty ordinary numbers of Shaddoll cards for a deck without Desires. Juggler and Trick Clown are the last engine, they just help make the 1 card combos off of Shaddoll Fusion much better and give us light fodder to use to make Constructs or Mechaba.  I almost never go into Apkallone, but monster negation comes in clutch, and it's searching/sending ability is super useful as a floating effect. 2 Construct and 3 Winda are my usual numbers. I want to have multiple Winda for when 1 gets broken, and I like running 3 so that when people are sniping my extra deck with Lysogasm they have to go for all the Winda to deny me it. Mechaba is the main Invoked card, it gives us a good negate, even if its rarely an omni-negate. Purgatrio breaks boards, and Raidjin turns things face down. Almiraj and Gardna give us ways to get Aleister in the GY, while giving us access to 1 card Mechabas or Purgatrios that add Aleister to the hand. Cross Sheep makes the link 4 plays possible, with Borrelsword to OTK and Apollousa for some added negation, which also makes it possible to combo off to end on a board with Winda, Apollousa, and Mechaba.  3 Effect Veiler and 3 Impermanence are for combo decks, particularly Amamancipator. Sometimes you need all 9 hand traps. Cyclone and Lightning Storm are for Backrow decks, with Cyclone also coming in over Nibiru against Eldlich game 2. Dark Ruler No More is just a habit, it will allow the deck to break a lot of otherwise completely unbreakable boards even if it falls short against the main meta decks."

You would usually normal summon Stratos to search out a Plasma and then make the Vision hero combo starting from Faris. It is not the best at playing the long game so you would have to combo out everything in turn 1 and possibly OTK in turn 2 or 3. The deck isn't that good competitively or anything, Just a really fun deck to run.  &nbsp;  My Rating:  Attack: 5/5  Defense: 3/5  Consistency: 5/5  Stamina: 2/5  Strong Against: Dragun Spam, Cyber Dragon  Weak Against: Dragma, Sky Striker  Vision Hero Faris + Stratos Combo  Cards in hand: Faris, any other HERO for Faris to dump  Activate Faris, discard the other HERO and SS itself  Activate Faris, search for Increase and put it in the S/T zone  Activate Increase, tribute Faris to SS it  Activate Increase, SS Vyon from the deck  Activate Vyon, send Malicious to the GY  Activate Malicious, SS another one from the deck  Activate Vyon's other effect, search a Poly  Link off Malicious and Increase for a Cross Crusader  Activate Cross Crusader, SS Malicious from the GY  Tribute Malicious with Cross Crusader's effect and grab a Stratos to the hand  NS Stratos to search for Liquid Soldier  Poly the Stratos and Liquid Soldier for a Sunrise  Use Liquid Soldier for a draw 2 discard 1  Activate the Sunrise, search Miracle Fusion  Banish the Stratos and the  Liquid Soldier to make Absolute Zero  End your turn. If you have Plasma in your hand you can play it, but if you want to use its effect effectively you need to go second or wait a turn to nick a monster. If you want to you can tribute Absolute zero for Plasma but it will nuke all the monsters your opponent controls so you most likely wouldn't be able to use Plasma.  Overall this deck is a very aggressive deck that has the potential to completely wipe out boards and deal with troublesome threats with Plasma (He doesn't target!!!). Stay safe and have fun!"

Real unsure of this version, but I want those high chances to see my starters, so I'm trying this out. I tried to just slice out as many of the bricks as possible to run 3 Called + 9 Hand Traps so that we have a shot going second game 1. But I think the right way to play the FTK is to go all in on it and just try and kill people. Even slight changes in your chances of seeing a specific starter can make a big difference over a large number of games.  Since the originator of the FTK seems to have done calcs and determined the original 60 card deck had great odds of FTKing, even through hand traps. As a result, I changed my mentality on seeing 1 card starters, and decided to trim down on engines I thought were unnecessary while still running as many cards as I wanted. This also let me pump up the hand traps, making space for Gamma, meaning more high impact ways to secure a win going second. All the cards are also full combo with Chaos Space and One For One, and D.D. Crow is a viable normal summon to make Romulus with (Phantazmay is only here to be used as an extender, but hey, draw some cards off our opponent's plays).  I'm already back to 60. I kept upping the hand trap count to improve my odds of seeing 2 hand traps, even in a 60 card deck. To compensate I put back in extenders, White Rose Dragon, which makes seeing a dragon less bricky while still being an extender, and Monster Reborn, which is full combo with any normal summon of a Dragon. I'm also on 3 Exploderokket, so that even if we see 1 copy we don't brick out - we have to see 2 copies of explode or a total of 4 bricks to brick out. It will happen, but not very often.  Option 1 is FTK after making a Negate. Option 2 is the buster lock. Option 3 is Nibiru token + Borrelsword OTK, but this is largely irrelevant, since the deck FTKs much more consistently than it sees Nibiru. It is worth keeping in the back of your mind.  The normal Route for the combo is using Borrelsword or Borreload to fire off on Exploderokket to deal 2000 dmage after equipping your Borrel Dragon with Piscu. Then on your opponent's turn, you use the Tracer you get off of Explode to fire on Piscu, clearing a board full of plants created by Black Garden to deal 4000 damage. Then your Borrel Dragon fires off on the Explode Tracer summoned for the last 2000.  So hear me out, but I think this deck might actually be tier 0. I replaced Called By the Grace with World Chalice Guardragon. There are 2 reasons for this. The deck needs a lot of hand traps, because in the mirror you are screwed if you can't both prevent them from making Herald AND stop them from using Union Carrier. This takes at least 2 hand traps, and while all of our hand traps are relatively high impact, and capable of performing that role in multiples while being combo pieces, you might notice the highest impact of them in fact special summon themselves, and that Phantazmay doesn't do much in the mirror going second but dig for Nibiru. I think the built-in synergy of being a combo card that Brainstorms and protects your combos is reasonable, but these probably should be sided out in the mirror, or replaced with Imperm if this deck does become Tier 0. World Chalice Guardragon doesn't combo with Chaos Space, but it does perform full combo with any Dragon Extender, and just as importantly, it protects Union Carrier, which is really the whole plan of the deck when you think about it. It seems like the most vital place to attack the deck in the mirror, and it CAN protect from Imperm and Gamma, which Called cannot. It can also be an extender if you've pitched Driver (or made Needlefibre on your turn), not super relevant but it can come up.  3 Tracers comes up in a deck with no other level 4 Rokkets. Rokket Synchron still hasn't come up, so I'm running the third Tracer."

Mayakashi,shiranui,eldlich, Zombie world control.","This is a versatile, unpredictable, Zombie-fest. Only instead of relying on chance, I've catered it to be easily manipulated into one of 4 strategies. I've purposely stayed as on zombie theme as possible. At a glance some of the card choices, and some cards that I dont use (draganecro, rivalry, super poly to name a few) may seem odd. But, it's all for an easily manipulated flow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll name a few combos, but if you enjoy pure zombie bashing like I do you will get the hang of it hopefully. At first I would brood over turns, having the starters for 3 separate valuable combos in hand with extenders already on field and balerdroch waiting to negate ash. But, after a while you learn what's useful when. I've worked on this for roughly 2 months now.  Made of what I physically own, though I have ALOT of zombies. It could use another golden lord, and it wouldn't hurt to ditch haquero and book of life for 3x called by sided.  All....ALL thoughts,recommendations, and criticism is welcomed. Help me make this deck be fun, versitale, and meta viable.  Please keep in mind it is a pure zombie deck. I think bomber dragon is my only non zombie and I put him in here to break well established boards. I was noticing the deck lacked a dark hole or raigeki wipe. But, I wanted to keep the trend of not relying on chance alot.  &nbsp;  Now onto the strats.  Monster manipulation through the multiple ""send from deck to gy"" cards and thinning if you chose to activate each eldlixir and golden land card the moment you can, then banish asap to cycle em through.  Extra deck choices: mayakashi and shiranui full synchro 1 ofs except for yoko, its strangely easy for this deck to pop out synchros, zombie-skull for either extra punch, to force an offensive response if your opponent is turtleing or to rank up with another tuner.  Links: sucker for draw power and to start the link ladder, savior ""sends"" dakki if you wanna do the ole mayakashi roulette or mezuki for SS from GY or gozuki for SS from hand or glow up bloom for SS from deck or if you dont have zombie world out yet (it's out by turn 2 for me consistently) then send banshee. I've also been crafty before, had supremacy and Bayonater on field beside dakki, opponent thinks I'm going for mayakashi, link bayonater and supremacy bring out bomber dragon activate spectralsword in gy with spiritmaster, summon samuraisaga and destroy opponents face up (alternatively I could have used spectralsword with bayonater and double juked into mayakashi roulette avoiding bombers zones) but then tune dakki w samuraisaga boom you just went full into a whole other 2 boss monsters that weren't mayakashi.  I'm definitely going to make this too long but, I'm committed and excited to share this with the community. I've searched so hard seeing decks that where good but not GREAT and upon the realization that a more than casual pure zombie deck was possible because of the hidden summoner and secret slayer support I buckled down, my phone and laptop didnt give me a solid look, something about laying the cards out in front of me helps me visualize ratios and patterns. Then I take it to the screen and trouble shoot. Anyways..  Spell choices: I'll address the elephant, mayakashi winter is bricky, but really read it and look back through what I've compiled, 2 Yoko's, 2 spirit master, mid game that's an easy 2 destroys or I mean you get it there are just so many routes you just judge the board and focus on keeping hand advantage. It's easy to use your entire hand first turn and establish a pretty strong board, it's even easier for your opponent to slap a nibaru down and grab a quick win for his deck. Also, winter sends dakki from field for a plus 1, if you can SS a lvl 3,5,7,or 9 synchro then you got a hitter. I have 2 allures for draw power because its euphoric to then use samsara to pull em from banish to deck AND DRAW AGAIN. That's crazy... use 2 effects only sending to gy allure so only loosing 1 card, in order to return 2 banished tuners to deck (easily searched) and draw 3 cards. Mayakashi return is situational as well, use it to send one of the monsters or pull em to hand or search for winter if you already went through the roulette. 1 foolish burial and 1 monster reborn, because that's how I got the brick ratio down....honestly.....running 3 zombie world I've sided a terraforming and have 2 banshees. You will learn (if you dont currently know) what decks you want to have zombie world out first turn for and what decks to side out both banshees and a copy of it to improve another strat for. Also, if you ""send from deck to grave"" eldlich you can use his effect easy, then with him on the field all of those confining spells that can only pull him out become doorways to options. Eldlixirs SS from hand deck and gy, (depending which you use) and have 0 restriction as long as you got eldlich on field.  Onto traps: samsara has saved this deck from loss more than I ever imagined it could when I threw it in on a whim. This card is soooooo underrated, it can banish 1 of yours from field, and there are plenty of reasons why that's good and you are safe for that turn. Even if your opponent msts it or something, it also returns your tuners and synchros to the deck and nets (if you choose synchros you dont shuffle and therefore do not draw).  The golden land monsters are basically my zombie version of Called by and a clean ""destroy 1 face up"" as you can see there are multiple ports for card destruction. I've actually used Conquistadors summon to destroy a gozuki I had summoned for a ""sends"" and got to SS and banish from gy. The eldlixir of scarlet sanguine, I hate this but.....they're gonna be bait. Idk why but, people see the eldlixir trap (sanguine) and just have to negate or destroy it while set. Its gonna happen over and over just start telling yourself its bait now, it's the best one of all of them bc it SS from deck n gy but, I've almost never gotten to resolve it. <ol>  	<li>Hmmm, side deck stuff: some double and triple prints to bend the deck in-between matches so if you face-off against a previous onlooker you can throw them off, ghost sister and swallow slash where my answer to avoiding nibaru, and it's all beneficial. Fraulein is a special card, he can steal magician girls or dark magicians to keep em away from their supports, or empower an already ridiculous shogunsaga for a HUGE beater, or, to keep that extender or balerdroch or whatever on the field for a turn longer. Typically I'll side in ghost sister if I'm going to also run fraulein to recover some of the LP. The opponent will either go off anyway hoping they have enough turns to dwindle you back down, half combo just enough to keep em in the game which typically is still a nice chunk and I've found is the least successful response unless your running low atk, and the dreaded third response, my favorite one, they stick to normal summon and end turn. Now you have nothing for lifepoints, and your card worked. You wanted to halt special summons and that you did, what the opponent dosent know is that you wanted this, you had drawn ghost sister first turn and awaited the right time to strike..turn 7..combo into bomber, attack and use fraulein, pay all but 100 LPs, opponent trys to negate HA! Flip solomn judgement and cut 100 to 50, attack with all your might, differential LP damage on top of the opponents monsters atk reflected, and if they had created one of those boards they think is unbreakable, then summon fraulein 1 spot over and wipe the field still judgmenting a negate.</li> </ol> In summary, i prefer choice to chance, and zombies over all in this game I've been playing my whole life.      I look forward to the responses that will aid to improve the deck. But, I urge you to get a small feel for it first, bc it's so fun to just decide what kinda deck you are gonna play, stop mid-combo and link into something that starts a combo for another strat....i understand I'm being ambitious with a ""Quad Splash"" but, there is something here.  This deck took on, adamancipater and skystriker with victories. Orcust, as long as you hold out until they setup and then find a way to wipe it (many destroys and banishes or bomber) then throw down lethal. Shaddolls hate zombieworld/balerdroch combo, if you can pop out 1 or 2 more negates (hand traps or solomn, etc.) Then setup the mayakashi roulette its typically over the next few turns, if They overpower or effect kill your skeletal mayakashi you get to unwind into yoko and destroy a card saving your remaining negates and purposely letting that turn pass to refresh balerdrochs negate.  &nbsp;  Monster: Shiranui Swordmaster x1 Tsukahagi, the Poisonous Mayakashi x1 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring x3 Jack-o-Bolan x1 Shiranui Spectralsword x2 Doomking Balerdroch x2 Shiranui Squire x2 Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi x1 Bayonater, the Baneful Barrel x1 Uni-Zombie x3 Gozuki x1 Necroworld Banshee x2 Shiranui Spectralsword Shade x1 Mezuki x2 Glow-Up Bloom x2 Shiranui Solitaire x3 Eldlich the Golden Lord x1 Shiranui Spiritmaster x2  Spell: Allure of Darkness x2 Mayakashi Return x1 Zombie World x3 Cursed Eldland x1 Mayakashi Winter x1 Eldlixir of Black Awakening x2 Foolish Burial x1 Monster Reborn x1 Eldlixir of White Destiny x1  Trap: Conquistador of the Golden Land x2 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine x2 Shiranui Style Samsara x1 Huaquero of the Golden Land x1  Extra: Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi x2 Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi x1 Topologic Bomber Dragon x1 Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi x1 Vampire Sucker x1 Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi x1 Shiranui Squiresaga x1 Shiranui Samuraisaga x1 Shiranui Sunsaga x1 Archfiend Zombie-Skull x1 Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi x1 Shiranui Shogunsaga x1 Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy x1 Avendread Savior x1  Side: Book of Life x1 Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash x1 Vampire Fraulein x1 Conquistador of the Golden Land x1 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine x1 Cursed Eldland x1 Plaguespreader Zombie x1 Solemn Judgment x2 Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood x1 Terraforming x1 Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion x2 Glow-Up Bloom x1 Huaquero of the Golden Land x1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Side deck is personal feel free to build it as you want.  Ritual monsters are just good extenders in the deck with situational great impact. You can cut them and the ritual cards for other extenders like backup secretary or balancer lord. If you do don't forget to cut Cyberse with aswell, you would add for example a Cyberse Quantum Dragon.  For budget options you can cut dark ruler for handtraps or disruptions. Acesscode is very expensive but it is the best option we have by far as we are limited to cyberse monsters (due to reborn). You can try with avramax or zeroboros but it won't be as efficient as Accesscode Talker. Cynet Mining is also quite expensive but i think it is mandatory to reduce brick."

If going first, you can set up an Apollousa for 3 or a Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If you're going second, you want to make Borrelsword or Accesscode Talker and go for game.  <strong>How does this deck work?</strong>  Every card in this deck falls into one of three categories: Starter, Thunder Dragon, and Extender. Any starter + any Thunder Dragon + Any extender can end on a Titan and a LINK-4.  <strong>Bread and Butter Combo: </strong>  Given that you have an starter, a Thunder Dragon, and an extender in hand, the combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Activate your starter and send Thunder Dragonroar</li>  	<li>If the Roar is in grave, use your extender to banish it. Once banished, special summon a Thunder Dragondark</li>  	<li>Link your starter and the Dark into a Cross-Sheep</li>  	<li>Search Thunder Dragon Fusion with the Dark (If you already have it in hand, you can search for a Thunder Dragonhawk to extend even further, or a Thunder Dragon to pop cards with Titan)</li>  	<li>Use the Thunder Dragon card in your hand's effect (or any other way to get it out of your hand), then use Thunder Dragon Fusion to make Titan.</li>  	<li>Use Cross-Sheep's effect to resurrect your starter.</li>  	<li>You now have enough monsters on the field to go into Apollousa for 3, Crusadia Avramax, Borrelsword, or Accesscode.</li> </ol> <strong>A three card combo? That's too much</strong>  Since the entire deck is comprised of cards that fall into these three categories, it's relatively easy to get the pieces you need. Also, some cards have the ability to function as multiple types of cards (ie. Thunder Dragonhawk is both a Thunder Dragon and an extender)  <strong>Why are you running Lightsworns? Dangers are better</strong>  You can run Dangers, but you might not have enough space to run them all in a 40 card deck. In testing, I found that the deck's biggest issue was getting enough cards in the grave on the early turns, and the Lightsworn engine helps with that greatly. You also need cards in the grave for your extenders, and this is the best engine to do so. Raiden is also a light, which means you can banish it or pitch it to Chaos Space."

My name is Maximillion ... Should you want to master the Toon Archetype, and enhance your Yu-Gi-Oh knowledge, please feel free to","<span><strong><u>Nostalgy Time - An extensive guide on how to play Toons - June 2020</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Intro</u></strong><strong><u>duction:</u></strong></span>  The Toon Archetype got a huge boost recently, with the release of the Toon Chaos Booster Box. New additions to the Toon Series would certainly have made Pegasus proud, and might also have reconciliated the fans with Konami. Long neglected by the firm, the archetype was withering away, filled with cards that were far too old, and therefore full of constraints that no longer make sense in today’s metagame. Fortunately, Konami brought out the heavy artillery to the delight of the early fans, offering us some crazy search engines and one boss monster to fuel the deck!  <strong>Warning:</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the deck may be very fun to play at locals, it is far from being able to compete against any real Tier 1 meta deck. Some would say it could fall in the Rogue category, at most. That being said, let’s dig in!  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/a5/ToonKingdom-JP-Anime-GX-NC.png"" alt=""Pegasus at its finest!"" width=""467"" height=""334"" />  <span><strong><u>In-Depth Analysis:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Amazing consistency thanks to the addition of <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> and <a data-name=""Toon &lt;a data-name=&quot;Page-Flip&quot;&gt;Page-Flip&lt;/a&gt;"">Toon </a><a data-name=""Page-Flip"">Page-Flip</a>. <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> remains one of the best searchers of the entire game, basically enabling you to pick any Toon card from your deck, while not even being limited to one activation per turn.</li>  	<li>Ability to easily summon ignoring the summoning conditions, which is abused by the deck’s strategy.</li>  	<li>The powerful field spell <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a> acts like a protection for all your creatures.</li>  	<li>Dealing Direct Damage: your Toons can pass through any threatening body, as they can attack your opponent directly (as long as Toon World / Kingdom is on the field).</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Weaknesses: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Lack of Explosiveness: there is no such thing as huge combos involving tons of summons with the Toon archetype. You won’t be able to set up any kind of lockdown or establish a powerful end board with multiple negations. That is the main reason why I find the “Going 2nd"" approach for the deck way more effective.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a> being one the greatest strengths of the deck, it also appears to be a double-edged sword! Indeed, the deck relies heavily on this sole card: all the strategy depends on your capacity to put it on the field. Should this card be countered (destroyed / banished / negated), you will have a hard time trying to recover.</li>  	<li>Draw Power: there is no real Toon draw engine worth playing in the deck. That is why <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> comes in handy.</li>  	<li>Bricks: to a lesser extent, some Toons can end up being dead draws in hand as most of of them have a high level. One notable example is <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Toon Dragon"">Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</a> that we often do not want to draw (not always the case though).</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/40700000/Pegs-vs-Kaiba-with-Blue-Eyes-Toon-Dragon-maximillion-pegasus-yu-gi-oh-40700066-502-380.jpg"" alt=""Toon Blue-Eyes the left behind (So charismatic yet so bad!)"" width=""420"" height=""318"" />  <span><strong><u>Stra</u></strong><strong><u>tegy:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Going 1st:</u></strong></span>  Do not overcommit on the board, try to protect your Kingdom, and set up <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a> (search it). Ideally, you would end up with one big toon on board (Red-Eyes, <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a> (BLS) or <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a><a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician""> (DM)</a>), Toon Kingdom, Toon Terror, and one Bookmark in grave. If you get lucky, you will also end up with a hand trap for some more negates. This end board might not look that impressive, but with one negation and one Kingdom protection (Bookmark), you can still manage to survive your opponent’s next offensive. Keep in mind this deck is built to go 2nd. If you go first, you just want to slow down your opponent in order to get a chance to break his board and overwhelm him on your 2nd turn.  <span><strong><u>Going 2nd: </u></strong></span>  This is where the fun begins!  Try to interrupt their combos with hand traps. <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>, <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> are obviously good targets to consider by the time I am writing this. Get rid of your opponent’s board with <a data-name=""Evenly Match"">Evenly Match (EM)</a> if you open it. Based on the state of the board, it is up to you to decide whether you need to bait your opponent with EM or another card instead. <strong>Choose wisely which card you want to resolve the most. </strong>Remember that you do not really care if your rival has big bodies on board as your toons can attack directly and are indestructible thanks to the field spell. On the other hand, you would rather want to get rid of backrows or sneaky Effect monsters that could potentially endanger your Kingdom.  <strong>Then, you must set up your Castle at all costs because without this cartoon-like fortress, your monsters are weak and powerless. </strong>  <strong><u>Main Strategy / “Combo”:</u></strong> Extend on board. <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a> + DM and any other Toon card in hand --&gt; Normal Summon Black Stone, Special Summon (SS) Red-Eyes --&gt; SS DM with Red-Eyes Effect --&gt; SS BLS with DM effect sending the Toon card to the grave. You can overlay DM + Red-Eyes for a Rank 7 play. For instance, Xyz <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon</a> in order to revive Red-Eyes with its effect, or <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a> to destroy a card on the field. Use BLS to push for damage or banish another card.  <strong><u>Strategy 2 / Emergency plan:</u></strong> Effective against backrows deck. If you did not draw EM, and have to face a board full of set cards / or annoying creatures, you will want to play as much BLS as possible, one after the other. Let’s say you summoned the first one through Page-Flip, use its effect (banish), then SS another one from hand, tributing the BLS on the field, banish another card, and repeat this operation one last time. You end up with only one BLS on field, but you banished 3 cards. <strong>The BLS banishing effect is a soft “once per turn”, take advantage of it!</strong>  The entire deck is very searchable and reminds me a bit of the Nekroz search engine. Thanks to Bookmark and Toon Table, you will be able to consistently select which tactic to use in order to adapt to your opponent, as you will have access to any specific Toon card. Hence, depending on the situation you are dealing with, there is plenty of options available, which I describe below:  <span><strong><u>Toon Toolbox: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Facing a powerful Link Monster? Use <a data-name=""Toon Cyber Dragon"">Toon Cyber Dragon</a> to Megafleet your opponent’s extra monster zone.</li>  	<li>Search for <a data-name=""Toon Harpie Lady"">Toon Harpie Lady</a> if you want to quickly get rid of a Spell or Trap card.</li>  	<li>Any useful card in your opponent’s grave? Search for <a data-name=""Mimicat"">Mimicat</a> and steal it.</li>  	<li>Any annoying monster on your opponent’s field? Go for <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a> instead … and steal it!</li>  	<li>Want to set up an omni negate? Search for <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a>.</li>  	<li>Need to summon a big boy? Activate <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> --&gt; always choose BLS + Red-Eyes + DM. Then, depending on which one is randomly picked, adapt your following play / strategy.</li>  	<li>Need an Extender ? Search for <a data-name=""Toon Cyber Dragon"">Toon Cyber Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Toon Harpie Lady"">Toon Harpie Lady</a>.</li> </ul> <img src=""https://pm1.narvii.com/6101/edb0634fc3b1189a67506d54af2ace35d4ececc3_hq.jpg"" alt=""The creepy ... shadow cat ?"" width=""443"" height=""332"" />  <span><strong><u>Rational behind Ratios:</u></strong></span>  3x BLS: Best Toon so far, nothing to add, great stats, great effect, relatively easy to summon.  2x Red-Eyes: you do not want to open it, it is a brick. You only want to SS it through Black Stone.  3x Black Stones: combo starter. You want to open it. This is your only normal summon. It gets you Red-Eyes which gets you another Toon from hand in return.  3x DM: you want to open it in order to SS it through Red-Eyes effect. If you need some space for a specific tech, you may remove one. I am still debating on the right ratio.  1x Comic Hand / Harpie Lady / Mimicat / Cyber Dragon / Toon Terror --&gt; you do not want to open them, you want to search one if needed for a very specific purpose.  3x Evenly Matched: very strong going 2nd card + you usually do not set up big board going first, so you can still get good value from it in case your defense gets wiped out.  3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> / <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: really depends on the meta, any hand trap will do. Main objective is to disrupt your opponent's play to contain their board.  <span><strong><u>Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Always use Extravagance first &#x1f609;</li>  	<li>If you do not have another Bookmark in hand, always Toon Table into Bookmark into another Toon card in order to set up your Kingdom’s protection in grave ! <strong>Very important!</strong></li>  	<li>DM and Red-Eyes cannot attack directly the turn they are summoned. <strong>BLS CAN</strong>.</li>  	<li>Toon Table cannot search Mimicat &amp; Comic Hand, <strong>Bookmark CAN</strong>.</li>  	<li>If Page-Flip or Bookmark gets negated, please re-read this again and again: ""<strong>If you negate the activation of a card that can only be activated once per turn then you may activate another copy of said card again in that same turn.""</strong></li>  	<li>What do you want to see in your opening hand going 2nd? Bookmark / Page-Flip / Kingdom &amp; Field searchers (<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> / <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a>) / Table / Black Stone &amp; DM / Evenly Matched / Hand Traps</li>  	<li><strong>Do not forget to use Black Stone Effect in Grave !</strong></li>  	<li>You can swap the Evenly Matched playset for 3 <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a> if you face too many spam / combo decks --&gt; You can steal the token with comic hand and swing with it for ... maybe game ?!</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Other Toon cards to consider: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Gemini Elf"">Toon Gemini Elf</a> is tempting because of the discard effect, but too slow as they cannot attack the turn they are summoned.</li>  	<li>Similarly, <a data-name=""Toon Masked Sorcerer"">Toon Masked Sorcerer</a> drawing effect looks nice at first sight, but it also requires one turn to be activated + 900 ATK is really bad.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Ancient Gear Golem"">Toon Ancient Gear Golem</a> if you wish to increase chances to be able to summon BLS.</li>  	<li>Potentially <a data-name=""Toon Mermaid"">Toon Mermaid</a> x3 if you add <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> to your Extra deck, but then, you would change the whole deck structure. You would need to switch to an Xyz Rank 4 focused deck and adapt your extra deck accordingly. It is not optimal at all in my opinion. And Mermaid alone is full garbage, the card being too old.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Briefcase"">Toon Briefcase</a> if you want to improve your Going First plays.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Mask"">Toon Mask</a> is too slow, not worth the effect.</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/df/Yugioh036.png"" alt=""She's so cute!

A single Redeployment ends on Apollousa, Avramax, Block Dragon, and Howitzer. We will","The new rank 5 Vespenate the Spinbreaker enables the synergy between Ancient Gear and Machina. The end board with Apollousa, Avramax, Howitzer, and Block Dragon is easily achieved with <strong>a single Redeployment</strong> or any of <strong>Gearframe + Irradiator/Possesstorage</strong>, making the consistency is somewhat acceptable. Bricking wont be a big issue as you will play regular Citadel control or handtraps. We will have 4 Ancient Gears (Frame, Box, Ballista, and Howitzer) too along the way if you didnt banish them for Block Dragon, it means we can follow up for Chaos Ancient Gear Giant via Verte/Overload Fusion. We dont use Halq in the combo, it's just there for follow up play/free plus.  The combo is super long, I will upload the replay tutorial (it uses Codebreaker package it means <strong>you gotta free the link 3 zones for them</strong>). <a>https://bit.ly/3er2PVX</a>  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kAr8chT.png"" alt=""image"" />  The Machina lineup consists of Irradiator, Gearframe, Possesstorage (great in grind game), and Redeployment as 3 ofs for our combo starter. 1 Citadel and 3 Overdrive is there as Citadel control and recycles your banished machines, esp since we use Overload Fusion and Block Dragon.  The Ancient Gear package is small as theyre just combo pieces being Ancient Gear Fusion, Box, Frame, and Overload Fusion (Chaos Giant follow up via Verte).  Rock lineup enables further spamming mid-combo despite being bricks (lol). Block Dragon (easily searched and summoned along the way, watch the replay), Adaman Researcher and Seeker, Weeping Idol, and 3 Gigantes.  The rest is just handtrap as well as Crossout target (not TCG legal yet) and generic backrow removal.  <img src=""https://www.yugioh-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dr_vellian_crowler-561x372.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Themed, end board is hard to penetrate without strong cards like DRNM, Sphere Mode, etc. Combo can adapt going first or otk.  Cons: Bricking hard.  Cards to think of: Machina Fortress is good in grind game but with negs. Ancient Gear Wyvern works via Ballista/Howitzer for free plus if we draw Frame/Box but it is another brick."

Use <a data-name=""Lightsworns"">Lightsworns</a> to fill out your graveyard and Burial From a different Dimension to return banished cards to use all over again. Eldich is useful to negate and summon another monster that fills your field with powerful cards and Doomking Balerdroch can be helpful in certain situations. Your Uni-Zombie should effectively bring out the right cards you need in order to wipe the opponent's effects and lifepoints before you can deck out. If some cards feel weird, that's because they are. Minerva isn't a perfect fit but can be helpful and sometimes Zombie Master is redundant. Have fun toying with it."

(True King Dinosaurs deck June 2020)","<img src=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enm_mCgTGuM"" alt="""" />Around 2 weeks ago, I was surfing YouTube when I found a video from League of Legends' official YouTube channel. It was a music video for K/DA's song, POP/STARS. I ended up absolutely loving the song from this virtual K-Pop group. So much, in fact, that I had previously made a deck inspired by them! <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/k-da-kill-die-arise/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/k-da-kill-die-arise/</a>  &nbsp;  Here's the link to the POP/STARS music video, if you wanna watch it! <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4</a>  This actually isn't MY deck. I actually asked one of my followers on Twitter to make it a week ago, because I was dealing with burnout. I have her to thank for making this deck. Anyways, ""We POP/STARS"" is meant to go second 100% of the time. Your goal here is to OTK your opponent. To help with that, this deck uses cards that have recently taken comptetive Yu-Gi-Oh! by storm in the TCG. Crystron Needlefiber, Jet Synchron, Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, and even Accesscode Talker."

Instant Fusion gets out an Elder Entity to bring out ","With the use of Castel, the ""Flip"" Effects that the Geargias use can be triggered off easily. The Book of Taiyou is another great addition, and I would run 3. Book of Moon is better off on side deck. The Elder Entity helps get your Geargias out of your hand with the use of Instant Fusion. Xyz Summons are done Quickly and Easily with cards like Geargiaccelerator, Gadgets and Geargianos that I run here. I side deck the Rank 3 and I play the Wind Ups too! They can flip easily. As for the Dreadnoughts, I usually Xyz into them with the Geargias and the Geargianos. I usually use Ancient Gear Box with Geargiauger to search the Geargias faster, but the Disadvantage for this is that I can't get my Geargiaccelerator with this, so I usually recurr to reusing Geargiarmor's ""Flip"" effect to search it, or the Gear Gigant X. Usually the Geargias that go to the Grave I bring them back with either Monster Reborn, Geargiano, and Geargiano MK-II. Mk-III I just keep one of that guy there to get out any Geargias out fast. Basically Xyz Summons really quickly, and uses many Special Summons, so it does have the risk to be Nibirued. Many of the Xyz Summons can be negated, and it still needs a lot to go but this seems to be a pretty solid Deck on its own."

This is to boost consistency of getting towards the Halq and then to combo off from there.  Then I play 2 baby dragon just to make sure that you can easily have access to a level or lower tuner monster from your deck.  I also play the 3 guardragon garmides because it is an extender.  I play 3 of the lv9 guardragon to go into with either elpy or its own effect.  I then play the black luster sword lock to stop your opponent from using the extra deck.  1 copy of red-eyes darkness metal dragon as another extender to bring out using elpy if u have drew one of the lv9 guardragons.  Unexpected dai + The load of monster reborn-type cards - to extend your combos.  Effect Veiler and the Ash Blossom: To stop some of our opponents plays.  Extra Deck: You can see why I play certain cards in the replay.  <span>3. Replays</span>  <span>I will be uploading replays daily of some rated games fo the deck to show the decks overall power.</span>  <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=603931-19462446</a> - Alter vs Combo Normal  <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=603931-19463227</a> - Tenyi vs Combo Normal  <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=603931-19484707</a> - Rokket vs COmbo Normal  Updated Deck Games:  <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=603931-19896883</a>"

""<span><strong>Morgan, the Enchantress of Avalon</strong></span>"", provides a decent cover in response to the effects that our rival can use, and if combined with the ""<span><strong>Noble Knight Dystran</strong></span>"", resulting in the negation of an effect and the destruction of a card face up in control of our opponent.

The deck I'm gonna present to you today is the one I currently use, it is a True Draco deck that I built when I came back to YGO in Master Rule 3, I updated it since then so it would always stay relevant and work around nerfs the archetype received. To this day, its purpose is still the same, being an excellent Anti-Meta deck that is able to have a great control of the field as well as limiting the opponent's options. <h3><em><strong>Composition :</strong></em></h3> <h4><em><strong>Monsters :</strong></em></h4> <ul>  	<li><strong>Metaltron x1 :</strong> A very good boss monster, provided you summon it correctly it gets a full effect immunity (even to yours), it can also be discarded and called by through TK Return. We do not make use of his second effect in this deck, you are free to swap it for another monster if you wish to.</li>  	<li><strong>Dinomight x1 : </strong>Probably the best TD monster (save for the ultra-op Master Peace), which explains why he is limited. You want to get him out on the field ASAP (provided it is safe) to help setting up your continous traps.</li>  	<li><strong>Dreiath x1 :</strong> A very good monster that effectively shields your other True Draco monsters from getting rekt by most common Meta effects, it's always good to have on the field, its second effect is also very good as you. I advise running at least 1, but you can add a 2nd or even 3rd copy in your deck if you want to counter the Meta more efficiently.</li>  	<li><strong>Ignis Heat x3 :</strong> The Spell counterpart to Dinomight, it is much less strong but it is still a decent monster to have, you can remove one copy.</li>  	<li><strong>Majesty Maiden x2 :</strong> Another good monster to have, it's weaker than the other in the TD archetype but it can help you search for another TD that you need.</li>  	<li><strong>Night Dragolich x3 :</strong> A surprisingly underused card, especially with TD, it is a Wyrm monster that switches all non-Wyrm Special Summoned Monsters to Defense position as well as reducing their current Defense Value by their original Value (which often means it will be set to 0). Given the fact that all TD monsters in this deck are Wyrm, there is absolutely no reason not to use such a simple but extremely efficient monster. Seriously, keep it at 3 and enjoy.</li> </ul> <span><em>You may be tempted to add <strong>Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</strong> (or even <strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong>) in a deck with so many Continous Spells (and Traps) and wonder why I don't use them. The short answer is that <strong>those are bait cards for TD decks</strong>. </em></span>  <span><em>The long answer is that even if there probably will be a duel in which you can summon Hamon and laugh in a 4000 ATK monster that deals 1000 effect damage each time it destroys another monster and that offers attack protection to other monsters when staying in DEF mode, it would also require you to also run at least <strong>1 or 2 copies of</strong> <strong>Cerulean Skyfire </strong>to efficiently protect and make the most out of <strong>Hamon,</strong> which would take up precious Deck Space for cards that you <strong>cannot search</strong> and that have <strong>very poor synergy</strong> (not ""innexistant"" because of the continous TD spells) with TD cards. </em></span>  <span><em>I'm sorry for the long parenthesis to talk about this but it is a common mistake begginer TD players make when they want to create a deck. So, please, for the love of the Egyptian Gods, don't do that, it's genuinely trolling and will cost you much more duels than it will win you.</em></span> <h4><em><strong>Spells :</strong></em></h4> <ul>  	<li><strong>Dragonic Diagram x1 :</strong> I would bet it is the strongest Field Spell in YGO, it is way too perfect and we are lucky (or not, depends on your side) it is not fully banned, each TD Monsters can't be destroyed in battle once EACH TURN. You can also discard any card on the field or in your hand to search for any TD card in your deck once per turn. And as a side benefit, TD monsters gain 300 ATK and DEF.</li>  	<li><strong>TD Heritage x3 :</strong> Depending on the number of TD cards you discarded during this turn, you can draw the same ammount once per turn. Needless to say it can turn up into a +2 / +3 or more on each use.</li>  	<li><strong>TD Disciples x3 :</strong> Your main (and only) recycling tool, able to save your sorry ass if Dinomight, TK Return or Dragonic Diagram are destroyed and sent to your GY, that card is much better than you might think, it can be a life saver, it also allows you to get a +1 once per activation, which is always nice in the long run.</li>  	<li><strong>Terraforming x1 :</strong> Well, do I even need to tell you why ?</li>  	<li><strong>Domain of the True Monarch x1</strong> <strong>:</strong> This card is actually insanely good with TD, you do not run an Extra Deck here and decks relying on Tribute Summoning are very rare, locking your opponent out of their own Extra Deck. Its second effect is also very good to make up for TD's generally low ATK values. You can run more than one copy of it, don't forget you can search it with Terraforming too.</li>  	<li><strong>Card of Demise x1 :</strong> A very good instant +2 card. The prices you pay for it are no big deal, setting up a good field is better than inflicting damage and discarding unused monsters is okay since you can bring them back with TK Return or recycle them with DC Disciples.</li>  	<li><strong>Pot of Duality x3 :</strong> This card is decent, you trade it for one of the next 3 cards in your deck, it is a +0 but you get to chose what you need the most out of the options you get, and you do not Special Summon anyways.</li>  	<li><strong>The Monarch's Stormforth x1 :</strong> Give the Kaiju / Super Poly treatment to any big wall or annoying monster like Dragun or Zeus standing in your way. Sadly, that cheesy strat is dying as a lot of new boss monsters have effects preventing them to be tributed (f for Obelisk btw) or effects that allows them to negate any dangerous card once per turn, so you have to be creative to get those effects wasted first. Keep that card at one to avoid bricking !</li> </ul> <h4><em><strong>Traps :</strong> </em></h4> <ul>  	<li><strong>TK Return x2 :</strong> No but seriously, that card, it's just straight OP, get it on the field ASAP and make sure you can recycle it in case something bad happens to it, every turn without Return on your field is a turn you didn't play right. With its recent return to 3 copies, you can throw in a 3rd. <em>TK Return counts as a TD Trap ! </em></li>  	<li><strong>TD Apocalypse x3 :</strong> This card is also really OP but it smh isn't Limited or even Semi Limited, you can fuck up your opponent really badly with its effect, but we'll talk about it later.</li>  	<li><strong>The Monarchs Erupt x3 :</strong> It negates the effects of all monsters that were not Tribute Summoned, that's it, I don't need further explanation. Allthough you gotta make sure to always have a Tribute Summoned monster on your field, which shouldn't be too hard.</li>  	<li><strong>Waterfall of Dragon Souls x2 :</strong> A good search card, especially if you abuse its second effect (we'll come to it later). You can add a 3rd copy if you want.</li>  	<li><strong>Rivalry of Warlords OR Gozen Match x1 :</strong> Those cards can be usefull against decks featuring only one Monster Type or Archetype, you can add more of these but I do not think it is worth it as it can brick you if you get them when you do not need it. (I'm currently putting those in the Side Deck)</li>  	<li><strong>Storming MF x2 :</strong> That MF is fire, literally. Yeet all ATK position monsters your opponent controls into his hand (or extra-deck). If you get it off, you will most likely see your opponent instantly surrender (and sometimes call bullshit or flame you).</li>  	<li><strong>Infinite Impermanence x2 :</strong> You know the card, you know why it's good.</li>  	<li><strong>Escalation of the Monarchs x1 :</strong> Because Tribute Summoning during your opponent's Battle Phase is always fun and giggles, you can already summon during his Main Phase with the TD traps.</li> </ul> <h3><em><strong>Playstyle :</strong></em></h3> True Dracos have held a good spot as an anti-meta deck since their release, being really dominant in 2017 and early 2018 (and still being strong in 2020). Despite numerous limitations and bans, the Archetype is very good and almost always combined with other Archetypes to solidify its or the other Archetype's strengths while covering for weaknesses. This deck is making use of Monarch cards to make it hard for the opponent to Special Summon (as well as locking down the Extra Deck).  As I said earlier, I have been using this deck for a long time and I think my win-ratio throughout the years is roughly or above 75%, IRL and Online on YGO.PRO (and now EDO.PRO). However, living in a small town far away from the bigger cities, I have not taken part in any major tournament, which would be this deck's true test.  I have a <strong>harder time going against other TD or Monarch decks</strong>, the end result depending more on the RNG and luck than anything else and against <strong>Dark Magicians</strong> and <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes decks</strong> (by Vanilla I mean decks that want to summon the regular BE White Dragon without using Chaos Max / Neo Ultimate or any other non-normal monsters) as they are unaffected by some of my lockdown cards. I recently came accross some trouble against some <strong>Phantasms decks</strong> when having a mediocre starting hand as they are Power Decks that do not rely much on the Extra Deck and you need to make perfect use of your resources to dispatch them.  Not gonna lie, I'm expecting you to know how TD work and what their unique gimmick here if you came here and read this far but I'm going to sumarize it incase it is not your case.  <strong>TD Monsters are to be Tribute Summoned and they can use Continous Spells or Traps to be Summoned.</strong>  TD Spells have two effects in common : They allow you to Tribute Summon a TD Monster once during <strong>your Main Phase</strong> (in addition to your Normal Summon) and, if they are sent from your field to the Graveyard (through being use as Tribute or Destroyed / Discarded), they allow you to <strong>destroy any Spell or Trap card</strong> on the field.  TD Traps also have two shared effects : They allow you to Tribute Summon a TD Monster once during <strong>your OPPONENT'S Main Phase</strong> and, if they are sent from your field to the Graveyard (through being use as Tribute or Destroyed / Discarded), they allow you to <strong>destroy any Monster card</strong> on the field.  That means that you have to be mindfull of your cards and how you manage them. You nevertheless have the ability to cycle a lot through your deck and to draw or search a lot of cards through clever usage of your effects.  If you go first, you want to assert dominance over your opponent and to make sure you won't have your field shatered in an instant and to get OTK-ed, which is the point of the current Meta, relying on the ""Monarch"" aspect of the deck and Dreiath for cover. If you go second, you want to break your opponent's field wide open with your spells and traps and to make sure he does not have any chances of making a come back (with Dragolich to lock him out of special summoning from the GY for example).  Do not hesitate to tribute your TD spells or traps if you need to get rid of the opponent's backrow or monsters, even if that means tributing TK Return, the gods will forgive you in that leads you to a victory, especially now that it is not Limited anymore. Also, do not be the noob that activates the Spell and Traps GY effects when your opponent have nothing you can target, you will have to destroy one of your own card and you will look (and feel) dumb. Anyways, this deck has a lot of Combo Potential, here is a few examples to get you started, I'll let you discover the rest by yourself ! <h3><em><strong>Combos and Tricks</strong></em></h3> <h4><strong>10 IQ combos : </strong></h4> <ul>  	<li><em>Card of Demise + TK Return</em> <ul>  	<li>Just send TD monsters to the GY during your endphase, and instantly after doing that, summon one with TK Return.</li>  	<li>You can also ""cheese"" the damage immunity this card grants to your opponent if you use it during your Main Phase 2.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><em>Dragonic Diagram + Any TD Spell or Trap (+TD Heritage)</em> <ul>  	<li>You not only get to search a card you need, you also yeet a card your opponent controls in the process.</li>  	<li>After that, you can use TD Heritage to draw a card (or more if you sent more TD cards from the field to your GY this turn)</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><em>TD Apocalypse (+ Dreiath III) + TK Return</em> <ul>  	<li>When your opponent attacks, use TD Apo to target a monster you control and send it to the GY to halve the opponnent's monsters ATK points, then use TD Return to bring that same monster if Defense position.</li>  	<li>This combo gains 90 bonus IQ if the monster you sent to the GY is Dreiath as you will be able to use its effect to summon any TD monster and then you can call back one of the highest DEF points TD monster.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4><strong>100 IQ combos :</strong></h4> <ul>  	<li><em>TD Apocalypse + TD Apocalypse (or TK Return if you can't do otherwise)</em> <ul>  	<li>When your opponent attacks, use TD Apo and target another TD Apo (or Return if you REALLY MUST), not only will your opponent's monsters lose half their ATK points, you will also be able to destroy one.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><em>TD Apocalypse + TD Apocalypse</em> <ul>  	<li>Just use TD Apocalypse effects twice, halving even further your opponent's monsters ATK. <em>Be mindfull however, the trick here is that you cannot use that combo in the same Chain, so you will have to find a way to create two different Chain blocks !</em></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><em>Waterfall of Dragon Souls (+ Dreiath III) + TK Return (+ TD Heritage) (+TD Disciples)</em> <ul>  	<li>Use WDS second effect to send a monster you control to the GY to draw two cards (or more if you sent more monsters to the GY with that effect)</li>  	<li>Add 100 IQ if that monster was Dreiath (you know the reason if you read the TD Apo + TD Return Combo)</li>  	<li>Add 300 additional IQ if you then use TD Heritage to draw even more cards (tho it has to be during your turn)</li>  	<li>Make it over 9000 IQ if you can then get TD Disciples off and to draw one last card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><em>Metaltron XII + Dreiath III (+TK Return) (+Any TD Spell)</em> <ul>  	<li>Use Dreiath to Tribute summon Metaltron, then use its effect to special summon another Metaltron (if you have multiple copies of it) or any other TD Monster.</li>  	<li>Add 100 IQ if you then bring it back with TK Return</li>  	<li>Add Cyber Dragon Nova IQ if you then use a TD Spell to Tribute Summon another Dreiath</li>  	<li>Add Cyber Dragon Infinity IQ if you once again use a TD Spell to Tribute that other normal summoned Dreiath to Tribute Summon another monster (and Special Summon again with Dreiath)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4><strong>500 IQ Combo :</strong></h4> <ul>  	<li><em>Escalation of the Monarch + Metaltron XII + Dreiath III (+TK Return) (+Any TD Trap)</em> <ul>  	<li>That is actually the same combo than the one I just mentionned, but you will start it during your opponent's Main Phase or Battle Phase instead of during your turn, causing Chaos within is mind as you play YOUR TURN during theirs.</li>  	<li>If you do that during the opponent's Battle Phase, you won't be able to use the (+Any TD Trap) part and you will have to wait for your opponent to get to his Main Phase 2, you can circumvent that issue with Escalation of the Monarch.</li>  	<li>Seriously, it already happened to me several times that confused opponents mistakenly ended their Battle Phase or lost to the Timer because they weren't sure who had to play and what Phase we were in anymore.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3><strong>Lockdown Combo :</strong></h3> Night Dragolich + Any Tribute Summoned TD Monster (preferably Dreiath or Metaltron or both) + Monarch's Erupt + Domain of the True Monarchs + TD Apo + A card ready to be used for TD Apo + Infinite Impermanence ready. Your opponent can only break it piece by piece, and you should be able to deal with it.  &nbsp; <h3><em><strong>In conclusion :</strong></em></h3> I thank you A LOT for checking this deck and reading this far, do not hesitate to try the deck out or to ask me if you have any questions left. If you have constructive feedback to give about anything, do not hesitate either. I will surely keep updating this deck as BanLists come and the Meta evolves, I am often experimenting with new stuff revolving around TD (I'm currently trying an Invoked + True Draco deck, it's good stuff but it is sometimes weird). Once again, thank you for reading and see you in a duel !  Drultime  EDIT 1 : March 12th 2021 : Rephrasing Cyber Dragon Infinity IQ combo to remove confusion, Typos cleaned, update recommendations for TK Return following it's <strong>Return</strong> (pun/20) to 3."

I tried to embody the same energy into this deck. With the hand trap monsters try to stall your opponent if your hand sucks. Its a pretty basic deck just try to get out your boos monsters and smash your opponent to pieces! Once that monster dies synchro summon Borreload Savage dragon and continue the assault. (This deck is not very good but might be fun to play against higher level decks and just cheese the match)

Has countermeasures to most meta decks (comes with video).,"Video for some of the combos:    From what I've experienced, it's impossible to be consistent with Dark Magician Deck regardless of how many draw engines you add to it. The reason for this is because of the number of cards that can be potential bricks if other cards are still inside the deck, not the actual draw power of the deck itself per se.  Therefore, I did not add spellbook engine because it requires a normal summon, which conflicts with Rod (and having 3 in your deck), and since you can retrieve rod with Soul Servant, it shouldn't be too difficult with an average hand. Your normal summon is VERY important, using it for draws is the same thing as giving up this turn. You can quickly accumulate draw power using Dark Magician Fusions and Magicians' Souls, with a bit of luck you can EASY pull out 10+ cards from the deck. Draw power is not Dark Magician's real issue, reliance on a good starting hand is. It sounds counter intuitive but it's not as much as you think. Basically, for Dark Magicians, making sure that your starting hand can start in a way by having more card interactions is more important than drawing more cards. For example, using metafoes fusion results a deck shuffle, so you're getting a random deck. But using cchicken race or upstart goblin over metalfoes fusion,you can pair with magic circle or soul servant and choose what card you draw. As long as you can secure getting rod and souls, you can likely get something that matches situation, preferably a way to either get out Magicians' Souls or the Dark Magicians, which allows you to dump more Soul Servant compatible cards to the graveyard. Not having a once per turn restriction also helps tremendously compared to metafoes fusion.  Your main goal is to dump Mana/Dark Magician/Dark Magician Girl/Mahad to the graveyard, then gaining draws from it.  Rod and Magician's Souls are the main starting point of Dark Magician Deck, therefore it is necessary to max all of them.  Dark Magic Circle is one of the most important card in the deck, and since it can potentially draw a card if it is a Dark Magician spellcard(which is guaranteed used with soul servant), it is recommend to put all three.  Soul Servant is the main method of search your deck, it can search anything DM related in Deck/GY, its only downside is that it can be a brick starting with it turn one, but you can alleviate this by using in combination with Chicken Race or Magician's Souls.  On the other hand, Eternal Soul and Navigation are easily Searchable, so having all 3 is not necessary, especially when they can be bricks when you don't have Dark Magician in GY or in hand. Navigation in particular since you generally only really need to dump 2 monsters at once with Navigation in an entire match for fusion.  1 Mana, you only need one Mana, since you can dump her using magicians' souls (which should be your first priority most of the time when using Magicians' Souls) and you really want her to stay there or on the field, not in your hand or the deck. Mana is very good for deterring your opponent from targeting your monsters, since she is quite pesky in the sense that she can summon Dark Magician Girl from the deck when she is destroyed, in turn giving your +1 draw power from Soul Servant while leaving a monster on field. If Your Magicians' Souls get Effect Veilered, to the very least you can go for Red-Eyes Dragoon using Verte Anaconda using Magicians' Souls and Mana as materials.  &nbsp;  1 Mahad can counter many dark monsters, including Dragoon and Chaos Max Dragon.  2 Eternal Soul is nice to have on hand if you have another card that can get Dark Magician to the GY or hand, but having 3 is more than necessary, especially when it is easily searchable and even retrieve from GY with Soul Servant. Retrieving it using Soul Servant+The Dark Magicians also allows to summon Dark Magician on the same turn, which is very useful.  1 Secrets of Dark Magic is very important for summoning Dragon Knight and The Dark Magicians, but one is enough since it's searchable and generally you'll only use it twice at most, and you can use soul servant to retrieve it from GY as well. If you have Dark Magician Girl if your hand, you can also use her instead of Dark Magician for fusion to get her in the GY, which is very important for Soul Servant.  1 Illusion Magic is used for retrieving Dark Magician to your hand for Fusion/Navigation/Eternal Soul, as well as protecting your monsters from other more harmful effects than being sent to GY.  1 Eye of Timaeus, this card is not searchable but at same time can be bricky when running multiple. Since this Deck already uses Secrets of Dark Magic, you don't really need more than 1.  One Apprentice Illusion Magician, since there's only one Navigation in the Deck, the need to use her to get Dark Magician in hand doesn't come up that often. She can also be special summoned using Navigation, which can you an opportunity to fusion Dragun of Red-Eyes or Dragon Knight when it's your turn.  That sums up the Dark Magician cards.  I used Chicken Race over Upstart Goblin and Metafoes Fusion, mainly because: 1. You do not have a once per turn restriction; 2. You can use Chicken Race to draw a card, then use Magician's Souls to get rid of it to draw another, giving you two cards in the process.  1 Terraforming, since you're already running Chicken Race and Secret Village.  1 Super Polymerization, since it's searchable with Verte Anaconda you don't need that many. Moreover, you can also use this to remove most enemies since Verte can make another monster dark as well.  1 Red-Eyes Fusion and 1 Red-Eyes Black Dragon, because Dragun of Red-Eyes is OP.  Dark Magician Deck is very weak to enemy hand traps, so at least 2 called by the grave is pretty necessary, I feel. The Card <a data-name=""Three Tactical Talents"">Three Tactical Talents</a> will also help tremendously when you're faced with such a situation.  1 <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a>, though it may be side decked since it's a rather situational and can affect you as well (it will hurt you more than help you against decks like Poltergeist).  handtraps are handtraps. You can change with w/e you like, though some Effect Veiler is recommended because it's a magician monster, which allows you to summon Selene which can summon Spellcasters from graveyard, and can link summon into Accesscode Talk for a whooping 5300atk. You can also use it as The Dark Magicians fusion material, or Illusion magic.  As for Extras:  Dragon Knight: This + Eternal Soul is very powerful against many decks (though it's not infallible such as against Orcust), definitely bring one, though you only need 1 since it counts as Dark Magician and as such can be summoned with Eternal Soul even if it is sent to the GY.  Dragun of Red-Eyes and Verte Anaconda: I don't think I need to say anything how powerful this combo is. Even some Orcust run it nowadays.  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: Very easy to summon using super poly, especially with superpoly and vertes (which can turn one of the monsters into dark). At minimum it works on any monster that can be targeted and effected, since you can turn it into dark and use verte for the other material.  The Dark magicians: Extremely easy to summon, offers great draw power and can potentially get Dark Magician Girl on field for more Soul Servant draw power. It can also draw a card and set it and use on the same turn, in including Eternal Soul, which goes VERY WELL with cards like soul servant. Use its draw ability wisely every turn, save it until using soul servant and/or dark magic circle  Needlefiber/Selene/Accesscode Talker: Use a card+handtrap to summon it lategame, and you can use it to summon Selene, which can summon Dragun from GY if you need it. Alternatively, you can also use her to summon another Spellcaster then use them to link Summon Accesscode Talker (5300atk+destroying multiple cards without triggering them) to finish the opponent.  Knightmare Phoenix: Link-2 Summon, if the opponent runs Imperial Order this is your way out.  Imduk: Dark Magician can Link summon Imduk, so if you have two Dark Magicians on field or 1 in hand, you can make a Dragon Knight or Dragun. Having two Dark Magician on field is not a difficult task most of the time.  Linkuriboh: Since Linkcross is getting banned in July, it's less useful, but you can still convert Magician Souls into this to minimize damage. It's also necessary for easy summoning of Ningirsu: Normal summon a handtrap → Summon Needlefiber → Search Effect Veiler from Deck → Make Veiler into Linkuriboh → Ningirsu  Galaxy Tomahawk:  This is a a bit long, but basically it's extremely useful for setting up a powerful board with Dark Magician, since it creates tokens to summon link monsters like <a data-name=""Ip"">Ip</a> <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Astram</a>.  I've learned it from a Dark Magician veteran, a powerful combo with only 2 cards:  Rod + Magicians' Souls  <strong>Rod</strong> → <strong>Soul Servant</strong> → <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to summon <strong>Dark Magician</strong> →<strong> Soul Servant</strong> to fetch <strong>Maha</strong>d → XYZ summon <strong>Tomahawk</strong> → make <strong>Verte Anaconda</strong> + <strong>Union Train</strong> + <strong>Ip</strong> →<strong> Red-Eyes Fusion</strong> summon<strong> Dragun of Red-Eyes</strong> → Use <strong>Union Train</strong> and Equip <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> on <strong>Ip</strong>.  If you have extra bricks in hand, you can also consider using Verte's first effect then have Dragun deny it to get 1000atk AND remove it to save you from Sky Striker Roze/superpoly. Next turn Make <strong>Astram</strong>, <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> gets sent to GY, now you have Dragun + Astram, AND 3 Soul Servant related card in GY, meaning you can draw 3 cards with it.  As for the side decks, I don't have great ones in mind atm. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> is not only good synergy with Dark Magician Deck due to it being a dragon, it also pairs with  <strong>Nibiru</strong>, allowing to get the draws AND clear the board together. With <strong>Forbidden Drop</strong> I feel like Kaiju monsters aren't as necessary now, and since it can discard cards on field, you can use it to discard Chicken Race with no real cost (and probably benefits you).  Consider wiping opponent backrow if they're heavy on spell/traps with <strong>Dark Magic Attack</strong>.  Union Train can be used when making Ip + Verte combo,  since you'd have 6 monsters/tokens on board, leaving two left. You can use this method to bring out Dark Magicians or Palladium oracles then either equip it on the link monsters so when they are sent to graveyard as material, it gets dumped to the graveyard as well. Alternatively, you can also use Magicians' Souls to send it to graveyard while gaining a draw from it.  <strong>Skill Drain</strong> is useful but like Village can also hurt you, especially against Poltergeist.  If the opponent is a big fan of disabling magic cards, stuff all Typhoon the from side deck so you can stand a chance by destroying their cards like Secret Village of Spellcasters or Imperial Order."

All you need is 1 other Mathmech mo,"While both Mathmech and Sky Striker excel in going second, each of them has their weakness. Mathmech lacks of removal card and Sky Striker lacks in OTK power, mash them up together and they complete each other. Formud Skipper ties them together making it the best starter for OTK with 1 other Mathmech monster in hand just like regular Mathmech play, but the difference here we can summon Sky Striker with Formud along the way. Not only that, just like Salamangreat, now Sky Striker is able to OTK with Accesscode/Updater Jammer with the same starter above!  The combo needs <strong>Formud + Mathmech</strong> monster, so we play 3 Cynet Mining and One for One. Other way is 3 cards, Parallel Exceed + Mathmech + Sky Striker (Raye/Roze/Hornet). The Formud OTK combo is we use Formud copy Zeke, ss Kaina, use Formud chain Kaina (chainblock Ash, vice versa depends on you), add Parallel Exceed, ss Hayate use Exceed, ss another Exceed from deck, make Primathmech Alembertian add 1 other different Mathmech monster, use Alembertian tribute Hayate ss Mathmech (other than Sigma cus it can ss itself), ss Sigma. From here you can either make Final Sigma or Accesscode route. If youre making Final Sigma, ss it on extra zone, use Multiplication doubles its attack and swing for game.  The Accesscode route, you make Splash Mage with Alembertian + non-Multiplication, use Splash Mage ss lv4 Mathmech from GY, make Accesscode with Splash Mage and 2 mats (including Multiplication), use Multiplication and chain Accesscode. Now we have 8.6K Accesscode with bunch of different attribute link monsters in GY (3 at minimum, Kaina, Hayate, and Splash Mage).  Mathmech lineup: 3 Sigma, 3 Nabla, 1 Multiplication (searchable by Nabla and Alembertian, not a tuner means ded if we play multiple), 1 Equation (extender).  Sky Striker lineup: 2 Raye (2 cus it's not our main normal summon and we dont run Area Zero), 1 Roze (extender), 2 Afterburners, 2 Widow Anchor, 1 Hornet Drones. We dont run Area Zero/Multirole as we only play minimal Sky Striker cards, it means we grind only with Raye, Hayate+Kagari, or Shizuku.  The rest of the main deck is just typical go second cards. It's hard on TCG cus no Crossout to prevent Nibiru.  Extra deck is self-explanatory. Trisbaena is there cus we can trigger it by using Splash Mage to reborn Formud then Linkuriboh on Trisbaena zone, super useful against Eldlich/Dragma or after we use Red Reboot but cant OTK.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/VsFRdxd.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Consistent OTK and we play Sky Striker if we failed to OTK anyway, and lots of staple space.  Cons: Going first is bad, we play bootlegged Sky Striker, and going second against meta is really dependent on the staples you draw.  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/ef/Dark_Kuroda_manga.png"" width=""758"" height=""1001"" alt=""image"" />  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This is good, because I want to eat combo.","Latest version. Running the Uka package, because ironically in a Needlefibre world it is simultaneously generic and high impact. This leaves room for 12 total hand traps, and has a lot of bricks. On the other hand, the deck's grind game is pretty good for a synchro variant, it can slow a game right down, and capitalize by winning in an instant.  The extra deck is the Calamities + Pot of Greed combo, or the 2 negate combo as a back-up/follow up.  I like One For One. Very often you see it with Golden Lord (when you do see it) and so long as you have a hand trap its a 7th way into the combo. The deck doesn't really care that it doesn't use the normal summon, but it still seems worth it.  Nibiru is the other high impact hand trap that might still stop a turn, and basically lets me win the game, sometimes. Also, it combines with other hand traps very nicely against Adamancipator. Imperm is obligatory in Eldlich, it's a good generic trap that negates and activates from the hand, I think this deck will always run Imperm first.  I want to be back on 3 of each Golden Land trap. It gives the deck a better grind game, and increases the odds of seeing them just enough."

As many 1 card starters as possible, with good back-up plans.","Hi, welcome to the deck! The main goal is to make True King of All Calamaties off of easy 1 card combos. The rest of the deck are basically bricks that facilitate these combos.  Jet Synchron is full combo, pitching a card. Tuning finds you jet synchron, might mill Token Collector, Citadel, or Jinzo. One For One is the full combo without using your normal summon, allowing you to use any extender to Scrap combo off first, before Auroradon. It can pitch Jinzo, Citadel, or Token Collector for profit. Scrap Recycler are more routes into Needlefibre through Jet, and are also great follow-up plays, for routes to OTK and/or break boards. Its a nonbo with the field spell, since it will miss timing. Deskbot 003 is the best of these starters, since you don't have to pitch a card and can stock the GY up with an extra Jet for later use, such as to pitch a Jinzo you drew late into the turn. Urgent Schedule is a ""starter"" going second. You can OTK, pop backrow, wipe monsters, and even set up Halqifibrax through this card. Thanks to the field spell you can even use this card going first (though generally you won't be able to link with it afterward). Machina Citadel are to special summon off of Urgent Schedule, and you can loop them by stacking a back-up in your GY. Jinzo is a one of - it has 2400 ATK points, so it's easy to res with the field spell, and shuts down Imperm and Evenly. That's it. Foolish Burial is an extra copy that works as an extender in bad hands. Black Garden is nuts in this deck, being able to turn on Urgent Schedule for free turn 1 enables truly broken stuff, if we so choose we can clog up people's zones and slow the game down, so it's nice on its own with some of our solid hand traps. 2 each of 001, O-Lion, and Scrap Golem makes sense to me - you could cut down to 1 Golem and be happy, but it's nice to know your combo will work even if you see 1 brick, and there are unusual circumstances where using one of these as a normal summon still combos off. Pot of Avarice is a spot of card advantage, coupled with the ability to recycle combo pieces. It's really that simple, if the deck gets interrupted I want to have a second chance with the game. Gizmek Uka makes a lot of sense in the deck. It's a free special summon that locks people out of their extra deck for playing Needlefibre in a meta where every deck is Needlefibre. Eria the Water Charmer Gentle makes this a very high impact hand trap. All of our hand traps help make our board, while being as impactful against the current meta as possible and playing through Called.  Gizmek Orochi is back. This lets you make Apollousa with 4 negates without using up your synchro cards, for those games where you get Black Garden + Urgent Schedule or One for One + Scrap Recycler. It is also a free(ish) extender and a Gizmek Uka target that you can use to make Uka into an insane extender once you get your Black Garden.  Herald and Borreload Savage are things you can make with Gizmek Uka and Scrap Recycler or 003. This also gives you an alternative line of play with Urgent Schedule going first, and gives us a second combo after the first for 3 read em 3 lines of play. (4 if you count Eria). This means only running Accesscode for our Scrap Wyvern, but honestly, this is fine. I'll miss Borrelsword, but Accesscode does a good impression and also plays out of the Eria line.  I hate going down Auroradon, but I can recycle one copy with Avarice, and I can make Herald in other ways, so I'm running Herald as well.  I cut the copies of tuning in order to run Phantazmay. This increases our chances of seeing high impact spell cards, and doubles as a target to special summon with Black Garden."

Pure Altergeist 2020","Yo guys, I'm back! I know I've been gone a long time but its been because of school, covid and just other things going on in my life. No I did not get covid, but we had to go to my other house temporarily because it was bad where I live. But anyways, to start things back off I want to introduce you guys to my newest Altergetist build with Altergeist <a data-name=""Multifaker"">Multifaker</a> at 3. The deck is back at full power and I think its insane especially with Meluseek being a water attribute because you can use him and another other monster to make Eria, The Water Charmer and using her effect to steal your opponent's Crystron Halqifibrax which can lead to other combos like Ningrisu or Accesscode Talker. You can also do Almiraj (can be summoned off Meluseek being normal summoned) plus any other monster to make Hiita. Evenly Matched in the main deck is actually really amazing as well. Going second it allows you to break your opponent's board and then setup yours so that they surrender during the following turn since they won't have anymore resources. I don't really have anything else to say about this deck. Its consistent and I have tested it just like I do all my other decks for you guys. Enjoy and stay tuned for more!"

I actually named this deck ""The Power"", after that magic keyboard from the Cartoon Network masterpiece Regular Show. In that episode, Mordecai said he always wanted a girlfriend named ""The Power"". And given the metallic and bird themes of Raidraptors, it just seems like the perfect name for this deck!  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P3bM_9htzo</a>  &nbsp;  The Power is meant to go second as an OTK deck, although it can also make some OK first-turn boards if you open well enough."

Consistent 3 mats Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon with Fog Blade/Red-Eyes Fang with Chain online just ","Your favorite character Joey Wheeler and Yuto cards combined making this deck strong. Easy 3 materials Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon with its effect online and Red-Eyes Slash Dragon equipped with Fang with Chain, also with a chance for Fog Blade because Phantom Knight can search it instead if you draw the Rank-Up-Magic. This deck is using Dragon Link engine (too many cards banned, I dont think dragon link is even playable in world banlist), <strong>Romulus + 1 random extender</strong> to be exact. Combo is super long,<a> click here for combo tutorial replay</a>.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/dALRFKF.png"" alt=""image"" />  The Dragon Link engine is focusing on Black Metal Dragon for card advantage (because it's so hard without Elpy, Linkross, and Agarpain), so we play 3 Where Arf Thou/Magicians' Souls (Souls because our extender doesnt have to be dragon) and One for One. Souls are paired with Exodius because it doesnt need discard like Apprentice Illusion Magician. Codebreaker engine is there to accomodate the advantage loss from banned Agarpain, Elpy, and Linkross. We dont use Halq combo because no Linkross and Auroradon locks us from Codebreaker/Verte play. The side deck is mainly removal card because this deck cant break board inherently, Kaiju Slumber is nice as it wipes monster and gives us extender.  Pros: Themed, consistent cus using Dragon Link, big body, multiple negations with backrows, has recursion from Red-Eyes Spirit reviving REDMD.  Cons: 2 cards combo, Dragon Link isnt as strong in World/OCG banlist, only has monster negation/disruption, has deadly brick like Red-Eyes Fusion.  Cards to think of: Can put in Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon/Magicalized Fusion because it's strong but with more bricks.  PS:<strong> 1 card missing is the new REDMD errata </strong>"

Trying my layout to be as disruptive to hand traps and backrow as possible. Still experimenting with the deck. There aren't a lot of great Rock cards outside of the Tuners and Koa'ki Meiru Guardian, but I wanted at least 12 Earth Rocks as fuel for the deck, so I'm running 3 Gate Blocker. It'll help disrupt hand traps that target, and also makes removal annoying, and also turns of field spells. While Mystic Mine is the common application, in this meta it becomes a target both Rokket decks have to clear off of the field (if they don't find extenders).  I like the Danger! package a lot, actually. When you get ""unlucky"" it can deck thin for free, and they always equal an extra monster on the board with their effects. Not being tuners is harsh, but their levels (3 and 7) are actually useful with the earth Tenyi Spirit. Even if Dragite isn't on, going full combo with a Dragite on the board is insane.  You might actually play the crystals once Block Dragon and Linkross are gone. Koa'ki Meiru Supplier is also going to make the cut when it comes to the TCG, it would easily replace the Danger Package in the current build (running Clara and Rushka).  I decided to drop the Danger Package, not being Earth monsters combined with the RNG made them unreliable. Instead, I'm running Madolche Petingcessoeur. The reason for the Token Collector main is so that your hand traps don't disrupt Petincessoeur going second. You could also run Gamma, but I hate running any brick that isn't a rock monster in this deck. As a result, I have to run Gallant Granite as a back-up starter. I'm back to Soldier of Chaos. The deck needs a good Link follow-up play to make with Block Dragon, and it doubles as a tool against Eldlich. It also theoretically helps break boards going second, though generally the deck does that well enough with Dragite and Accesscode.  So far, Sekka's light has been insane, way more powerful than One For One and Monster Reborn in the deck. You never see it with Foolish, and when you do see both you still have your choice of a Sekka's Light if you want to +1 by drawing 3 cards OR a guaranteed Block Dragon (usually the call). I think Sekka's Light is okay with 1 spell, but I'd feel increasingly nervous with every spell you add. This is why we need to go the Petincessoeur route instead of Unexpected Dai.  Trying this version now, with the Buster lock and Revival golem. Only 12 Rocks in this deck, but that's fine while Block Dragon is legal I think. The Prank Kids engine will help a lot once Meow Meow is legal. (Also I'll get to say Doodoo Doodle Doo a lot.)"

Use Cyber Revsystem, Cyber Emergency, and Galaxy Soldier to help get a lot of monsters on the field. From there, link summon Sieger (Where applicable), however prioritize summoning Cyber Dragon Nova and bringing out Infinity for effect negation. Other cards can help support and speed you up or slow down the opponent,  The Side Deck is optimized against Fusion or Swarm (the deck type, not the archetype) decks. Super Polymerization can easily take out boss monsters - specifically, Salamangreat ones - quickly. De-fusion can disrupt the strategy very well and Non-Fusion Area will stop Fusion altogether. The rest of the cards are against Swarm Link decks. Skill Drain can negate the continuous effect(s) of a boss monster and you can bring it down with a Power Bond combo. Phantazmay and Summon Limit will severely hinder their ability to swarm and summon high Link Ratings.

Start off boards and go for Cherubini with your play-makers: Phantom Knights of Tear Scale, Tour Guide and Predaplant Ophrys. Chain Kagemucha knight to prevent play-makers from being negated by hand traps. Add instant fusion to hand using Ophrys to further gain card advantage. Use Leviair to set up board and use them to rank up into Utopic Future Dragon. Can go for Beatrice or Cicada King depending on if you have a Burning Abyss in hand. End board with Predaplant Verte and fuse Dragun of Red Eyes. You can alternatively use instant fusion to summon Millenium Eyes Restrict while Cherubini is on board to protect it from destruction. Can grind with Phantom Knights in grave and eventually use rank up magic for your win condition: Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon. Runs 60 cards to prevent drawing into search cards, is surprisingly consistent! Try it out! <h1 class=""page-header__title""></h1>"

The time has finally come for the Sacred Beasts to rise again and regain their former greatness!,"<span><strong><u>Phantasms’ Awakening – How to tame the Sacred Beasts!</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong></span>  The mighty lords <em>Raviel</em>, <em>Hamon</em> &amp; <em>Uria</em> …  These three creatures of darkness thrilled many apprentice duelists in the 2000s. Unofficial antagonists of the Egyptian Gods, the spectral members of this sacred trio have just been given powerful supports by Konami, allowing the deck to rise to a level of power never reached before. Quite unplayable in the past, mainly due to unreasonable summoning conditions, the new cards allow you to invoke your favorite demons in a much simpler way, through special summons, in order to unleash a blast of fury and wrath upon your opponent!  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/a/a0/DimensionFusionDestruction-OW.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150819035729"" width=""422"" height=""422"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Fo</u></strong></span><span><strong><u>reword:</u></strong></span>  I would not say this deck is Tier 1, but it can definitely compete against actual meta decks, should you start the duel with a decent hand. Hence, Tier 2 to 3++ seems to be the right category in my opinion.  I know a lot of people do not appreciate the Dragun package which seems “unbalanced” according to many players. Nevertheless, I decided to incorporate it as it makes wonders in the deck. One might argue Dragun is always splashable in any deck, but I tend to disagree with this statement. Sometimes, it is obvious Dragun is only there to fill a gap, or to pretend the deck is competitive. In this case, I can assure you Dragun deserves its place, and synergizes well with the board as I will explain later.  Last but not least, in order not to distort the deck too much and to keep its essence, I decided not to integrate the <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> related combos. You can already watch TeamSamuraiX1 (<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpDgM_QHH5A&amp;t</a>) &amp; Yacine (<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzp40uOF0IY</a>) latest videos on the topic if you want to play a more hybrid variation &amp; combo-focused version of the deck. <strong>I propose here a “purer” variant …  if one may use such a term to define a deck.</strong>  Having said that, let’s start the analysis!  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Powerful Search Engine:</strong> Amazingly consistent thanks to <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a>. Various combos that I will showcase later contain searchable pieces.</li>  	<li><strong>Solid Draw Engine:</strong> The Pot of Greed of the deck, <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, combined with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> and <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> allows you to dig in your deck fairly easily.</li>  	<li><strong>Powerful Big &amp; Scary Beaters:</strong> With 4000 ATK &amp; DEF, your demons are nearly invincible in battle. Two direct attacks are all you need to lower your opponent’s life points to 0.</li>  	<li><strong>Consistent “Mini-Lockdown” Capabilities</strong>: Thanks to <a data-name=""Sacred Beast Awakening"">Sacred Beast Awakening</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, you can set up very sticky board in turn one, quite hard to break.</li>  	<li><strong>Multiple Negates &amp; Interruptions:</strong> Dragun Engine, <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> for infinite spell/trap negate once per turn, <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a> to steal your opponent’s key monsters, <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> for omni negate &amp; usual hand traps to disrupt their combos.</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Weaknesses:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Huge inter-dependency: </strong>all the cards of your core engine synergize well with each other, but none of them is actually very powerful on its own. Your three “servants” need to be tributed. Your Sacred Beasts need to be protected. Your traps and spells need your Sacred Beasts to be activated.</li>  	<li><strong>Extra Deck under-exploited:</strong> <a data-name=""Armityle the Chaos Phantom"">Armityle the Chaos Phantom</a> looks badass, but it is actually terrible. There is no Boss Monster related to the Sacred Beast that could have a meaningful impact on the game. Extra deck is mainly used for Dragun, Super Poly targets &amp; Knightmare package, that is, generic extra-deck cards.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Uria, Lord of Searing Flames"">Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</a>:</strong> Unfortunately for us, special summoning Uria often means 0 ATK/DEF if you do not have any continuous trap in grave. Even though it has the best effect among all demons, its stats are too bad for us to incorporate this card in the deck.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> effects:</strong> these phantasms might be tough, there effects are mediocre, and you will not rely on them to develop your strategy. Raviel’s token can help you link summon, but it won’t come up very often.</li>  	<li><strong>Weaker when going 2nd:</strong> All your “Beast” related cards are basically oriented towards turn 1 play. They cannot disrupt your opponent. They search, they protect themselves &amp; build a defense, but they do not counter actively your opponent.</li>  	<li><strong>Your Graveyard:</strong> Particularly sensitive to hand traps &amp; other effects that prevent you from using effects in grave (<a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a>, Seven Gates 2nd effect).</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/5f/bc/6b5fbca525bb7da5747a7067b2a02d94.png"" width=""470"" height=""470"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>S</u></strong><strong><u>trategy:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Going Second: </u></strong></span>  If you lose the dice roll, try to bait your opponent before activating Seven Gate or Beckoning. If you manage to activate properly one of these and to further develop your board with one Beast and <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, you might have a chance to win. Against multiple negates though, it will be practically impossible to break the opponent’s board on game one <strong>if you do not draw <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>. With this fusion spell, you can usually make some sweet and disgusting come backs (<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> anyone?).  <span><strong><u>Going First:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Powerful Combo:</strong> there is multiple combinations to achieve same end-result depending on your opening hand, but you basically need at least Beckoning OR Seven Gates in hand plus two cards among the following to make it happen: Seven Gates (if you have Beckoning already) / Beckoning (if you have Seven Gates already) / Dark Beast / Chaos Beast / Awakening  <strong>Concrete Example:</strong> <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a> / <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a> <ul>  	<li>Play Seven Gates, search for Beckoning</li>  	<li>Play Beckoning, search for Awakening</li>  	<li>Use Beckoning 2nd effect to tribute itself for Dark Beast</li>  	<li>Use Dark Beast effect to special summon Hamon (or Raviel)</li>  	<li>Banish Dark Beast from grave to search for the other Sacred Beast</li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to send Chaos Beast to grave and ss it</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast effect to ss the Sacred Beast from hand (by tributing itself)</li>  	<li>Banish Chaos Beast from grave to search for Fallen Paradise</li>  	<li>Activate Paradise to draw two cards</li>  	<li>Set Awakening</li> </ul> <strong>Minimum End Board aka “Mini Lockdown”:</strong> Two Sacred Beasts + Fallen Paradise (= Sacred Beasts not targetable &amp; cannot be destroyed by card effects) + Activate Awakening on opponent’s turn (= Better than Skill Drain: negate all monster effects activated on YOUR opponent’s side of the field).  <strong>Very Important:</strong> if looking at your hand, you realize you won’t be able to gather two Sacred Beasts + Awakening, you should definitely go for plan B, involving the Dragun package (if you did not draw the red-eyes fusion of course). Indeed, having a 2nd Beast on the field does not bring you any specific advantage &amp; edge against your opponent (without the trap), compared to the strength of the Dragun alone. I won’t lie to you, you will see this combo way more often than the previous one, as it is quite hard to gather all the pieces in hand for the lockdown. That’s one of the reasons this deck is not Tier 1 by the way. However, the Plan B is also a power play, and will give your opponent a hard time to deal with it.  <strong>Plan B: </strong>Once again, there is multiple ways to establish a board involving Dragun. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the sequencing (combo order) by practicing with test hands. Here is one powerful combo:  Beckoning + Seven Gates + Hamon in hand: <ul>  	<li>Play Seven Gates, search for Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Play Beckoning, search for <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a></li>  	<li>Use Beckoning 2nd effect to normal summon Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast effect to special summon Hamon from hand <strong>in ATK position</strong></li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to send <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> to grave and revive back Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Link Beckoning and Chaos Beast into <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></li>  	<li>Use Anaconda effect to fusion summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to retrieve <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> from grave and activate it</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast Effect to search for <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a></li> </ul> <strong>Minimum End Board: </strong>Hamon + Cerulean Sky Fire (= First negate) + Dragun (= 2nd Negate + 2 monsters to destroy on your turn) + Fallen Paradise (= 2 cards + extra protection)  As you can see, <a data-name=""R&lt;a data-name=&quot;Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon&quot;&gt;ed-Eyes Dark Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;"">R</a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">ed-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> enables you to effectively use all resources available on board when you do not open with every piece of your optimal combo. It is not just a desperate addition to the deck in a vain attempt to foul you with some dubious competitive garbage!  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/8/80/Series048.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20120909191014"" width=""524"" height=""393"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Be very cautious when using <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>. Make sure you do not need to play<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""> </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> first, before banishing a part of the package by accident and make a fool of yourself ;)</li>  	<li>Always think about the right sequencing before starting the combo &amp; know the right timing to draw (try to skim your deck, so that you do not draw combo pieces you could have searched first!).</li>  	<li>Always play <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> in ATK mode in case you draw <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a>. This a requirement to activate its negation effect.</li>  	<li>Do not forget Raviel’s effect which summons a dark token each time your opponent NORMAL summons a monster. Can be useful sometimes … but can also backfire as it is a dark attribute token (<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: “Here I come!”).</li>  	<li>Keep in mind if you have two Hamon in defense position on your side of the field, your opponent cannot attack you.</li>  	<li>If you happen to have Dragun + Super poly on board, remember you need TWO cards in hand in order to activate both effects.</li>  	<li>Do not forget the second effect of Seven Gates, which can retrieve a continuous spell from the graveyard (either another Seven Gates, or more importantly, <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a>).</li>  	<li>Bear in mind that summoning a Sacred Beast through <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> effect will <strong>cancel your next battle phase</strong>, so remember to attack first if you can.</li>  	<li>Seven Gates can only search for a MONSTER that specifically list any of the Sacred Beasts while Beckoning can search for any CARD etc...</li>  	<li>If you do not need <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> (they are obviously bricks when drawn), try to recycle them with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>.</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Rational behind Ratios:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>42 cards instead of 40. I usually prefer to reduce the number of cards in my deck to 39 + 1 <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> for consistency’s sake, but this time, due to the Dragun package, I’d rather make a 42 cards deck (41+1) and reduce the odds of drawing one of the two major bricks in the deck (<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>). Hence the (39+1) deck core + 2 bricks. It would be interesting to run a probably test in order to check what would be the optimal ratio that would minimize the chances to draw these bricks, while not decreasing that much the odds of drawing other key cards. Of course, such study would be based on a certain number of subjective hypotheses …</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> and 2x <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: You do not want to play Pot into another Pot, so 2 is fine. Allure at 3 would be a little too much in my opinion, as most of the time, you want to send your Dark monsters to the grave, not banish them.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a>: the worst of the three ""servants"". It is a level 5 and therefore requires a tribute. If I had no Pot of Desires, I would only play one.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> and 2x <a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a>, because one is not enough and can be banished by Desires / Maybe 3x Hamon would be worth considering for late game. I happen to need it sometimes.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: not 3 because the deck also runs one Red-Eyes Fusion … and you need space. Plus, you can activate it through Verte Ananconda if you really need it.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> &amp; 1x Sacred Beast Awakening because they both are searchable, and you do not want to open multiple copies of these cards as they don’t do much on their own (remember the dependency weakness I mentioned before).</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>: big target for your opponent who will try to get rid of it. One extra copy to avoid running out of draw power. 3x is too much because it is easily searchable.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a>: best cards of the deck. You always want to open them first (Chaos Beast to a lesser extent though).</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> to go through your entire combos.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> is a tech choice: enables me to retrieve Cerulean Sky Fire or another Seven Gates if I already got one Seven Gates on the field. You could potentially replace it with a <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> if you prefer to send a monster directly to the grave.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: standard hand trap / You can replace it by any hand trap depending on the meta. I chose the most generic one.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>: this is very debatable / tech choice again. it is a strong going 1st trap to set, your opponent will most likely not see it coming and it is pretty good to shut down combos. It requires extensive metagame knowledge when it comes to deciding which monster needs to be stolen. You could swap it for <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> / <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> / <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> / <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> etc … Crackdown never fails me except in one particular scenario: it is sensitive to anti-target effects!</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>: omni negate … what else do you want? Take my mon.. life points!</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: works as an “extender” &amp; can save you sometimes by special summoning a Chaos Beast to start off a combo (still giving you access to your normal summon). Also to consider as a potential bait, because it is a threatening card for your opponent (currently limited in the banlist).</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>: not quite sure about this one. I have mixed feelings. Enable to fix very bad hands, but useless in late game. You could replace it with another Allure.</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/5/5a/Series150.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121029025225"" alt=""Yu-Gi-Oh!

You can buy the Hero and Superpoly targets online for little money. The only expensive card in this deck is Borrelsword Dragon but it's not necessary and I simply had it lying around.  &nbsp;  The Hero cards help with the consistency of the deck. You want to normal summon Vyon, then send Shadow Mist to the graveyard and add Honest Neos for a light monster or another Vyon for a dark monster to your hand. Then you can use the effect of Vyon to get a Polymerization.  Mask Change II is my lucky one-off to summon Masked HERO dark law. This card won me quite some matches already.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For combos you need to take advantage of the different Shaddoll graveyard effects. Typically you want to end up with Winda on the field to disturb the other player.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  This deck is fun to play and considering the cheap price it's pretty strong. Additionally you can easily improve the deck by integrating some more expensive cards."

Of course you could improve this deck for TCG or OCG only purpose, making it more annoying for your opponent.  Even though it is doubting at the first glance this <strong>60 cards deck</strong> has a good composition of hand traps, effect negators, hand adders, destroyers, and attackers. I am sure you will rarely get band hands. Even if you feel you got one, this deck give you chance to stall until you have the opportunity to counter your opponent. <h4>How to Play This Deck</h4> This deck is optimal in the <strong>second turn,</strong> because if you run out of hand traps, you will often get cards destroyer to wipe out all your opponent's cards. However this deck also has the capability to go first, because you could summon some effect negators from extra deck whilst having hand traps in your hand.  To play this deck basically just negate your opponent's monster to <strong>stop combo</strong>, but if you fail just wipe them all using cards destroyer. If you fail to stop the combo and have no cards destroyer, you still have chance to make a <strong>come back</strong>.  This deck contains monsters which can be summoned easily, have high attack, and can be used to summon powerful monsters from extra deck. So you just need to summon all monster that could be special summoned. Starting from the one with deck search effect, to provoke you opponent to negate its effect. Then you will easily control the field even if your opponent successfully do his/her combo."

So I remembered that everyones been using the 1 card full Synchro combo using <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Jet Synchron."">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron."">.</a> Sadly, Jet Synchron is a one card disaster. The combo goes like this: Normal Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh, Jet summon back, both -&gt; Halqifibrax, effect to summon <a data-name=""Orcust Brass Bombard"">Orcust Brass Bombard</a>. Linkross 2 tokens, Brass + 1 token -&gt; formula synchron -&gt; metal marcher summon back Bombard. At this point you still have the rest of your hand to use and you should be able to get out <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> and use Brass + Knightmare -&gt; Borreload Savage Dragon -&gt; equip Halqifibrax, then full Orcust combo from there. After testing this deck doesn't really brick. Its pretty consistent and can play well against other competitive decks. Hope you guys enjoy!"

The new F.A. field spell is a 0 card Halq and it doesnt even consume your normal summon. Combine it with powerful normal summon l","Boring deck but strong, you need Hyper Stadium + Meltdown to complete the 0 card engine. Stadium searches Auto Navigator (tuner), use Stadium extra normal summon by revealing Meltdown, normal summon Navigator, use Navigator add Stadium (+1), then play your Invoked line (+1). You will end on Savage + Arc Light + Raidjin on regular basis. Windwitch line is there using lv7 Wind Pegasus for extra interaction, making the line has 2 pseudo interruption, so it's still worth despite the restriction.  Pros: Strong rogue contender, acceptable end board, recursive as hell (less than Shaddoll tho), many staples slot.  Cons: Boring (hence the less explanation), too many counter for this deck cus meta is also combo deck."

Your main combo setup is Kageki with Kizaru, but with a few tech cards as support.  Since you have a plethora of searches for Kageki, you need only run 2, while Kizaru is a little harder to find. You can very easily make 2 Saryuja's in a turn so long as Nibiru does not show itself. You do have a few answers to Nibiru with your spells, so it isn't too big of a hurdle so long as you got through most of your cards getting to Isolde and Battle Shogun.  At times your opponent will get bored and ask if you are almost done because unfortunately, you do take your time to do a lot of setups so your opponent cannot respond in the following turn.  The best setup is to have the Kageki and Kizaru in hand or searched before you begin with a card that gains counters for gateway later, doesn't matter which card. Go into Isolde and add another Kageki, just in case, then send the following equips for Hatsume (or Kizaru if you didn't get him or one of the red/blue if you have the other in hand), Noble Arms, as it does nothing for you other than destroy a spell/trap for 500 atk points on a monster, Overdone Burial, as the cost is too high for what we usually want, it just helps out of sticky situations, and your choice between DDR or Living Fossil. DDR has proven to be more useful as you can get back one of the cards used for Hatsume's effect, and you have a lot of draw/search power in the deck once you get to Gateway with Battle Shogun's effect. Once you have Gateway, if it isn't destroyed from some effect, you are pretty good to go, your opponent can't stop you at that point and will usually forfeit. They ask if this is a hand loop, this is not that variant, but they will immediately go to the next game if they think it is and they don't have an answer. So you can fib, as it makes their hand useless, but you don't need them to know that.  Your ending board should have 2-3 of the following: Utopic ZEXAL which locks your opp out during their turn. Shi En as the staple negates 1 spell/trap. And Apollousa for your next turn, as ZEXAL protects you during your opponent's turn.  For siding, it is truly difficult to know what to side in/out of the deck as everything fills a specific purpose. The immediate answer is either the red reboot if you think your opponent doesn't have Infinite Impermanence or is an Altergeist deck as most decks can only stop you with hand traps. Prohibition is a tech choice of mine that allows me to say, I don't like this 1 card, so I'm going to let it not be part of the duel. This can be good if the only thing that can stop you is Nibiru, or ash blossom, or even an Imperm. The immediate ability to stop your opponent from even having the opportunity to perform an action is great, but it wont stop cards already on the field, so use it wisely.  &nbsp;  Alternate options for the deck are mostly replacing whats in the Extra or Side deck. For Extra deck, you can replace the Beast/Barkion cards for Abyss Dweller to stop combos that happen due to in grave effects or even a Naturia Landoise to negate monster effects if you have enough cards in hand to handle its cost. For side deck, you can always add in Ash Blossoms or Infinite Imperms in place of the royal decree or token collector. The side deck, in my opinion, is where you can throw in your special brand of techs. Back in 2014, I would run Fencing Fire Ferret in my side deck for a Madolche deck as there were a lot of destruction effects that were prevalent. It helped me to get my first top and would single-handedly win some games because people didn't think of that card. You can even change the number of certain Six Sams in deck if you feel that you need to get to other parts of the deck faster. Red/Blue is not mandatory for the deck, but it helps to either 1, get more counters, 2 get to Rebarian Shark for your ZEXAL. Squire is there as another option for a Lvl 1 target for Shien's Dojo that can be revived with Gateway. So experiment with this as the base, and see if there are areas for it to improve for you."

This variant is a balance between a few different elements. For starters, I want to be able to combo off, if not in every hand, at least sometimes. It seems like making an Apollousa or Mechaba turn one to protect the Winda from the disruption it cares about (IE: Golden Lord) is really vital to winning, so I wanted to focus on beating Eldlich game 1, and bring in side deck cards for more combo heavy decks. Trick Clown and Damage Juggler are here for their combo potential - they're not strictly necessary but they enable turn 1 Apollousa + Mechaba + Winda, as well as easy turn 2 Accesscode. Called By the Grave is unusual here, in that we're really just trying to snipe/negate Golden Lords with it, not stop hand traps. D.D. Crow does stop most Linkross/Auroradon combos, and is also a Dark monster for Winda - Effect Veiler would help make Apollousa more often, but we're really trying to get Eldlich game 1. Aleister the Invoker/Magical Meltdown/Terraforming are all 1 card Mechabas as well, which helps give the deck a needed boost of consistency.  Cut most of the Shaddoll cards for more copies of Ariel, Resh Shaddoll Incarnation, and Damage Juggler. We're trying to make the combo less bricky, while also increasing the frequency with which we can banish cards with Ariel, leaving in the Falco, Squamata, Wendi, Incarnation chain. Added back in some Shaddolls to get a free search.

You can do this about 3/5 of the time.  &nbsp;  Saryuja Skull is the most important card in the extra deck for starting the chain. The deck is set up to almost always get 4 different monsters on the field with two cards in hand.  Allowing for a three card hand at the end.  &nbsp;  Main Tactic  MC -&gt; Summoner -&gt; Toss Magic Card -&gt; Cat -&gt; Dark Soul + Air = Link 4 go dread Draw 4 cards -&gt; Ferret(Monk(Full combo needs the ferret and not the monk)/Faul Troll (Hopefully). -&gt; Ferret Special by Dread -&gt; Ferret Effect -&gt; Dark Souls, Rag, Pasuul. If you've drawn the Pasuul or dark soul go with Rag, Tuner (level 1), Rescue Cat. This will allow for Goddess and Naturia Beast on Field. Which at least allow for negate of magic and monster cards plus a few other combos.  Overall I find that it can run a strong -2 to hand, Gooddess and Savage and Gottoms on feild.  to get the needed -2 from hand you run the following Reborn(link Succession), Faultroll, Ferret. The ferret grabs three sabers faultroll spawns off effect. Link off your rag, dark souls, Pasuul and dread, So Goddess is now at 3,200. Then after doing that bring out the level 3 tuner and sync off for Gottoms, link/reborn the rag. Two Sabers on Field allows for Troll to Summon, Pop the Rag and then Gottoms. Leaving you with Faultroll + Summon Pasuul to go into borrel so you will have the following in play Goddess at 3,200, -2 to the hand, 4 counter savage. Two Searching at end phase for Boggart and Rag.  &nbsp;  A lot more to do with this combo as well, you could just go for a plan old rip the whole hand as well if you choose.  &nbsp;  Ferret, Faultroll, Monster Reborn(Link Succession)"

Between a frog engine and/or closing a Prank-Kids summoning loops on two Dropsies, you can go into TA first turn pretty much every turn, along with a couple Prank-Kids such as Bow-Wow-Bark and Battle Butler. TA can help protect your combos and stop your opponent's repeatedly as he summons frogs and Dodo-Doodle-Doo and Bow-Wow-Bark can infinitely feed Dropsies back to your hand as Aqua tributes, but we also have access to Invoked Raidjin and Millennium-Eyes Restrict through both Instant Fusion and legitimate methods (King of the Swamp), creating further difficulties for an opponent to get anything off. Fansies, Restrict, and even a Token can go into Linkuriboh, Cross-Sheep extends plays after fusions, Union Carrier equips frogs to Dropsies before it links off to further feed frogs into the grave for Ronintoadin plays, or pumps up a monster in a pinch. Accesscode Talker is an incredible board breaker when you're ready to go for the win, which we can make great use of as we run links of every attribute. If you don't have the cash for AT (understandable, got lucky from a pack myself), consider swapping Linkuriboh, Cross-Sheep, Union Carrier, and AT for Daigusto Emeral, Leviair, a second Bow-Wow, and Borreload/sword. Emeral can be an excellent back-up engine for recycling, Leviair can extend through your monsters banished by Ronintoadin and Rocksies, Borreload can chip boards and lean into control harder, while Borrelsword can be an OTK option."

I took that deck, and the advice from the comments of Hex_master, and came up with this.  Original Strategy from EmpatheticExodia below:  ""To keep it short, here is the main strat.  1 Stall and get Mystic Mine out, invalidate most decks.  2 Use Judgment and Bribe to keep Mystic Mine out.  3a Use all the draw power you can till you get Exodia.  3b Use cards like Cosmic Cyclone to get your LP lower than your opponents.  3c Use Draw of fate to stack your deck then use any draw 2 card to choose any 3 cards (like Exodia) to add to your hand.""  I removed the Swords of Revealing light, and in their places, I added Pot of Extravagance (as well as 15 cheap fusion monsters for EX deck), Field Barrier to protect Mystic Mine, and Demise of the Land to help in getting Mystic Mine out."

The Typing is nice but what really matters is that most Several Fluffal monsters have effects that trigger off ANY fusion summon or benefit from being in grave. At a bare minimum the Shaddoll engine gives Fluffals some extenders/starters to help guarantee to break a board. At the maximum Shaddolls are a ridiculous value engine that create insane pluses off of every fusion. P.S. you can mill shaddolls off toy vendor for there effects. <h3>How does the deck Play?</h3> The deck plays like a build-a-bear combo, every hand is different but the different value engines all lead up to the same thing: fusion summoning cards like <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger,</a> <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken."">Frightfur Kraken, or El Shaddol Construct to </a><a data-name=""clear the way and then Fusion summoning some more and swinging for game"">clear the way and then Fusion summoning some more and swinging for game</a><a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken."">.</a>  A much simplier way to clear the board for your OTK's are with cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. Super poly has crazy synergy with Shaddolls as just 1 Shaddol + any monster is a fusion, and the deck also plays <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> as an additional target, but another great use of Super poly is for a quick play fusion summon during the battle phase with your own monsters for extra attacks. If you don't draw a super poly or a dark ruler the deck can play around negates simply by playing more cards than your opponent can respond too. Cards like <a data-name=""Shaddoll fusion"">Shaddoll fusion</a>,<a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork""> Frightfur Patchwork</a>, and even just a basic <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> must be stopped by and opponent or they risk losing board state or card advantage. <h3>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</h3> <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>. Consistency, the deck is actually very consistent on its ability to get out a board that can OTK, but how good it is at breaking boards varies. Simply you wont have big cards like Super Polymerization or Dark Ruler No More in hand every game. However you can search Super Poly off <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>and set up for a easy Mudragon by using anaconda's effect to make a monster Dark, its just a hard card to make at times. Lastly this deck really doesn't do great going first. <h3>What to do Going First?</h3> Try to make <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> like your life depends on it. Most decks struggle to out winda and even if they do it slows them down. My side deck plays some more Shaddoll monsters to increase the chance of making a decent shaddoll fusion. Outside of that just try and use some of your searchers like <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>, and <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> to set up for your next turn."

Rebuilt the routing to make it legal and made room for the HERO Engine. Use the extra deck in the order it's in, or use the HERO cards if you need to Faris early.  Shoutout to Team SamX1, because I got the idea from his combos. Sam, you've been hugely influential to me.  Fire Flint Lady is going to shake up this deck a whole lot, by giving easy access to 2 card combos that find you your mask changes and polys while setting up a negate (more if you run Apollousa). In the mean time I'm running Maurading Captain, to do the free extending part of things and maybe even search Mask Change off of Shadow Mist."

I have no idea what to tag this now.,"If you like big numbers than this is the deck for you. This decks goal is to get out Red Supernova Dragon as quick as possible using the synchron/junk monsters. Using cards like Halqifibrax and Junk Speeder you can get this card out off of a single normal summon.  &nbsp;  Why is X card run?  <strong>Main Deck</strong> <ul>  	<li>3 Jet Synchron: Jet is a level 1 tuner that is a 1 card full combo. He has a handy revival effect that can easily be abused with cards like Linkuriboh or Junk Converter who will dump him into the grave while giving you advantage. On top of all of this if you synchro summon with him and he ends up in the graveyard he searches a Junk monster from your deck. Don't run any less than 3.</li>  	<li>1 Deskbot 001: 01 is used with Auroradon to summon several synchro monsters in one turn due to 01 reviving himself whenever you summon 2 or more monsters at once. While he is great for alternate combo strings when you don't open Junk Converter or Jet Synchron you don't ever want to normal summon him unless you need a level 1 tuner. He is best left in the deck until he is needed. Also his name tells you how many copies to run.</li>  	<li>2 Synchron Carrier: This boy is a level 2 non-tuner which makes him a great target for Junk Synchron. While on board he gives lets you normal summon again if you are summoning a Synchron monster. If you manage to synchro summon while he is on the board he will also give you a level 2 token. I don't want to run more than 2 since there are other more useful level 2 monsters, and you can't special summon him.</li>  	<li>3 Junk Converter: As the name implies he converts useless tuners into synchrons. He does this by sending them to the gaveyard as well as himself. You can then add any synchron from deck to hand. On top of this he is a level 2 non-tuner meaning him + Junk Synchron lets you summon out Junk Speeder. Plus when he is used for a synchro summon you are able to summon a Synchron from your graveyard allowing you to access garnets while they are outside of the deck. The only thing I dislike about it is that it was not a retrain of Quillbolt Hedgehog. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Fleur Synchron: Of the 4 garnet tuners you run he is the second least offensive to draw into. You want to summon him off the effect of Junk Speeder which will be explained later. If he is used for a synchro summon he lets you summon a level 2 monster from your hand which could help with play extention but I found it easier to just save him for the summon of Red Nova. Run 1.</li>  	<li>1 Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion: He is a level 2 tuner monster that summons a level 3 token when he is sent to the graveyard. This effect is best used either by summoning him off Halqifibrax or summoning with the effect of Auroradon to get the precious level 5 synchro summon. He has other effects but this isn't a Mecha Phantom Beast so they don't really matter. Run 1.</li>  	<li>2 Doppel Warrior: He is a level 2 non-tuner monster with a special summon condition. If a card is summoned from the graveyard (Jet Synchron, 001, or the effects of Junk Synchron and Converter) you can summon him form your hand. If you use him for a synchro summon he will give you 2 level 1 tokens. He can be a bit of a brick sometimes but his utility outweighs that minor flaw. As the artwork shows run 1 or 2 copies of him.</li>  	<li>2 Junk Forward: This level 3 manga Speed Warrior retrain. He is a non-tuner who can special summon himself so long as you control no monsters. While a free non-tuner is great I don't quite know if I would want to run 3. Since he isn't level 2 you will have to use less useful non-tuners to synchro summon with him. Run 2 or 3</li>  	<li>2 Junk Synchron: One of my favorite cards in the entire game. He is a level 3 tuner with the ability to summon a level 2 or lower monster from your graveyard on his normal summon. One of the best things you can do in this deck is pitch Junk Converter and any tuner to search Junk Synchron. Then you summon Junk Synchron allowing you to revive Junk Converter which lets you perform a level 5 synchro summon. I wish he was worth running three or but him being so reliant on a using your normal summon makes him a little situational. Run 1 - 2</li>  	<li>1 Road Synchron: He is a level 4 tuner who may as well be a level 2. He has two effects that change his level. If you use him to summon a monster that isn't Road Warrior his level is reduced by 2. His second effect increases his level by 1 if he attacks. He is one of the worse cards in the deck but him being treated as a level 2 or even 3 is useful for something a little later. Run 1 so you don't see him.</li>  	<li>2 Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing: This level 4 plane lets you summon two tokens if he is special summoned. You use him for a combo with 001 that I will explain later. But for now did you know his level increaces by the level of all Mecha Phantom Beast tokens you control? Run 2 so you don't need to put it back with avariece every time.</li>  	<li>1 Quickdraw Synchron: This rootin tootin level 5 cowboy tuner is the fastest summon in the west. You can special summon him from your hand by discarding a card which can lead to Halqifibrax combos, but I use him as another garnet for something I will explain later. Run whatever number you feel like.</li>  	<li>3 Fantastical Dragon Phantasmay: This level 7 dragon is used to fix hands if you are going second. You can summon him when your opponent link summons then draw cards equal to the link rating +1 and return cards from your hand equal to the link rating back to the deck. He is also able to negate effects that target cards you control and sends cards from your hand to the graveyard in the process. Him being level 7 lets you immediately go into Savage dragon late game once you run out of steam. While he is good you may want to run other hand trap cards instead. Feel free to replace him if you need to.</li>  	<li>3 Called By The Grave: Speaking of hand traps, this card stops them. Do not run any less than 3, this deck is pretty linear and has several choke points. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Foolish Burial: This card allows you to get whatever you need into the grave. Need 001 or Jet. You are good. Need a level 2, its got you covered. Its not necessary so run by preference.</li>  	<li>1 One For One: This one card lets you trade one monster card in your hand for one level 1 monster in your deck. You can summon 001 or Jet Synchron for your one card combo. Run 1 because its at 1. Unless you are in the ocg.</li>  	<li>3 Pot of Avarice: This card helps reset your extra deck as you can easily run out of usable cards. It also lets you draw cards. Just be careful of D.D. Crow or Called By The Grave as the card will fail to resolve if one of the cards you target gets banished. Run 2 or 3.</li>  	<li>2 Starlight Junktion: This piece of Synchron support lets you swap any tuner for a Synchron in your deck with a different level. Plus if you manage to synchro summon on your opponents turn you can spin an opponents card. This card is not necessary but can be very helpful. Run by preference.</li>  	<li>3 Tuning: This is just Junk Converter but a spell card. When activated you can add a synchron monster from your deck to your hand then mill the top card of your deck, which if you are lucky can get you those precious level 2 monsters. Run 3.</li>  	<li>1 Upstart Goblin: This makes your deck 39 cards.</li>  	<li>2 Infinite Impermanence: This is a trap card that works like a spell card. It can help you get past a Savage Dragon or an Appolousa. You may want to run evenly matched or lightning storm instead.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Everything here is 1 of but feel free to experiment with the cards or ratios if you like. <ul>  	<li>Linkuriboh: This little guy is part of the Jet Synchron and Halqifibrax combo. You can link summon him by tributing a Jet Synchron you control. Then you summon back Jet and you have the tuner and non tuner necessary for Halqifibrax. If you leave him on the board he can reduce an attacking monters attack to 0. If you run Halqifibrax, run this card.</li>  	<li>Linkross: This thing converts your useless link monsters into level 1 tokens for yet more synchro plays. I don't normally use him but I he is too good to leave out.</li>  	<li>Crystron Halqifibrax (or Needlefiber if you are a weeb): This card is one of the best cards ever made. It is a link 2 that requires a tuner and a non-tuner which summons a tuner from your deck. Nine out of ever ten games you will want to summon him. I use him to summon O-Lion, 001, and Jet Synchron in order to go into Auroradon. If you don't do that you can always tag him out for a synchro tuner in your extra deck and synchro summon on your opponents turn. Fun with Junktion on the field.</li>  	<li>Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon: This thing is a token summoning machine. He is a link 3 that summons 3 level 3 tokens to your board. I like to summon him using 001 and Halqifibrax so I can summon back 001 to go into other synchro monster. When you summon him you are locked out of link monsters for the rest of the turn but that shouldn't matter past this point. You can also tribute 2 monsters you control to summon Coltwing to summon back 001 again for even more synchro plays. Cant go wrong with this card,</li>  	<li>Accel Synchron: He is a level 2 synchro tuner that lets you draw a card on his summon. You can also synchro summon using him on your opponents turn. The easiest way to get him out is by either summoning some Linkross tokens or with the effect of Halqifibrax. He is good, I just don't understand why he needs legs and arms.</li>  	<li>Martial Metal Marcher: This is a level 3 synchro tuner. It is a slightly more restrictive version of Junk Synchron who can summon back a tuner from your graveyard. If you manage to synchro summon with him whatever you summon can become a tuner. You can summon him with the Linkross tokens or Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Crystron Quandax: This is what happens to Halqifibrax when you tribute him to summon a synchro tuner. He is a level 4 synchro tuner that lets you synchro on your opponents turn. Currently I am running his as I want to get more tuners in my graveyard, but I will talk about some possible replacements later.</li>  	<li>Old Entity Hastorr: He is a level 4 non-tuner synchro monster. You may be saying right now, why are you not running Herald Of The Arc Light? To which I say it looks cool. But Hastorr is more useful than you think. You see if you use him for a synchro summon he equips onto an opponents monster and negates their effects. They could just destroy him, but then his second effect steals their monster.</li>  	<li> Accel Synchron: This level 5 synchro tuner lets you modulate his level by sending synchrons from your deck to the graveyard. I will sometimes use him to clear tokens off the board. He also lets you synchro summon on your opponents turn.</li>  	<li>Junk Speeder: When I first saw this card it brought a tear to my eyes. This is one of my favorite pieces of legacy support in the game. This level 5 non-tuner combonation of Junk Synchron (not required to summon) and Speed Warrior (retaining his 1800 boosted attack) allows you to swarm the field with as many Synchrons as possible from your deck. He is the centerpice of this entire deck. With this versetile effect you are alble to go into any synchro monster you could possibly dream of. Though it locks you into synchro monsters, this effect is well worth it. If he attacks the turn he is summoned you can double his attack points to 3600 allowing him to get over most monsters. With the current build I have the goal is to summon him with at least 3 open main monster zones, then with his effect you will summon Fleur Synchron, Road Synchron, and Junk Synchron. You then tune them all together in order to summon Red Supernova Dragon. While I want to say you should run more than one, you will quickly run out of tuners once you use him so its best to leave him at 1.</li>  	<li>Stardust Charge Warrior: This level 6 non-tuner synchro that lets you draw a card. He can be used if you also manage to summon a Jet Synchron off of Junk Speeders effect. He can also attack all of your opponents special summoned monsters but good luck getting over anything with his 2100 attack.</li>  	<li>Shooting Risar Dragon: This level 7 synchro tuner is part of the alternate combo string. When you summon Auroradon while 001 is in your graveyard you can synchro summon with two tokens to get out this card. Using this cards effect you can then send Quickdraw Synchron from deck to grave to make this card a level 2 tuner. You can then tune him with the remaining token for Junk Speeder.</li>  	<li>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon: This level 7 non-tuner synchro monster is a late game option meant to lead into Borreload Savage Dragon. He is able to negate effects if you leave him on the field, but savage is just a little better.</li>  	<li>Borreload Savage Dragon: This card is a level 8 non-tuner synchro monster that have at least 250 more attack than Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as well as negates equal to the link rating of the card you chose to equip to him. Overall he is probably better than the boss monster. Speaking of the boss monster...</li>  	<li>RED SUPERNOVA DRAGON: This is the biggest beat-stick you will ever see. With the near endless amount of tuners you will be dumping into the graveyard (which will be a minimum of 4) will increase his attack points by 500 for each. He also has a quick effect that banishes your entire board resetting them to zero, but be careful because you don't get him back until YOUR next end phase.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Other Cards To Try</strong> <ul>  	<li>Unkown Synchron: Level 1 tuner that can special summon itself if your opponent controls a monster. There are too many other good level 1 Synchrons and his effect is only one per duel.</li>  	<li>Cyberse Synchron: Level 1 tuner that can double the level of a level 4 or lower monster. Might take out Road Synchron for this guy as Cyberse Synchron also offers some effect proteciton.</li>  	<li>Satellite Synchron (Not Pictured): Level 2 tuner that I forgot existed. He can special summon himself from the hand if summon a card from your graveyard and has level manipulation. Definitly worth considering,</li>  	<li>Steam Synchron: Level 3 tuner that lets you synchro on your opponents turn. Could be a backup level 3 in case you run out of Junk Synchron.</li>  	<li>Drill Synchron (Not Pictured): Level 3 tuner that lets gives your warrior monsters piercing and if you do pierce you get to draw a card. Good backup level 3 Synchron.</li>  	<li>Scrap-Iron Signal: Reusable counter trap that stops monsters. It requires you to control a synchro monster that lists a synchro monster as one of its materials.</li>  	<li>Herald Of The Arc Light: Better than Hastorr, but I still don't want to play him.</li>  	<li>Old Entity Cthugua: With Auroradon, Coltwing and Deskbot 001 you can get out two of these guys for a rank four monter and draw 2 cards. He also spins all rank four monsters so if you know a Zoodiac player you can always mess with them. Here are some fun Xyz monsters to try. <ul>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia: Rank 4 and its many forms: <ul>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia The Lightning to get over annoying cards.</li>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia Double to swing with 10,000 attack.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Daigusto Emeral: Rank 4 that is a mini pot of avarice. Worth considering.</li>  	<li>Gem Knight Pearl: Rank 4</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2nd Junk Speeder: Extra deck too tight and main deck doesn't have enough resources.</li>  	<li>T.G. Hyper Librarian: Level 5 synchro non-tuner. Free draw power if you can continue to synchro summon.</li>  	<li>Coral Dragon: Level 6 synchro tuner. Level 6 tuner is a bit awkward to use, but it can pop cards your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Satellite Warrior: Level 10 synchro. Requires a tuner and 1+ non-tuner synchro monsters. He then pops several cards and gains 1000 attack for each. He also summons 3 level 8 or lower Stardust, Warrior, or Synchron monsters from your graveyard to go into Shooting Quasar Dragon.</li>  	<li>Shooting Star Dragon T.G. - Expansion: Level 10 synchro that requires a tuner synchro and 1+ synchro monsters to summon. Has a quick effect destruction that responds to monsters and banishes tuners as a cost. It can also negate an attack and can summon itself from the graveyard by tributing two synchro monsters.</li>  	<li>Shooting Star Dragon (Level 10 synchro) + Shooting Quasar Dragon(Level 12 synchro): Quasar can negate any card spell speed 2 or lower, can attack at least twice and floats into Shooting Star Dragon. Shooting Star Dragon can attack up to 5 times depending on your luck but can't be summoned without Stardust Dragon. But it does float into Stardust Dragon.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Blazar Dragon: Level 12 synchro. Quasar but he banishes himself until the endphase so he is protected from removal. He dosent float though.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Pros</strong>  This deck is extremely flexible. You can easily change this to focus on whatever boss monster you chose. Synchro support has been amazing recently and this deck is great example of that. The 5D's nostalgia also helps. You can easily fit more hand traps into this deck as they can just replace some of the worse tuners and they wont get in the way.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cons</strong>  My build has no way to stop Nibiru. If you want to go into Red Supernova you need to summon at least 6 monsters. A few well placed hand traps like Ash Blossom or Called By The Grave can easily stop this deck. This deck will also probably no longer be legal by the end of the year as Jet Synchron and Deskbot 001 are in a prime position to be banned for the sins of Crystron Halqifibrax and friends. Also Red Supernova Dragon summons himself back durring your endphase which isnt a problem on any other similar 5D's cards which just made it a worse Topologic Zeroborus.  &nbsp;  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  This deck is fun to play. I had been growing somewhat sick of this game recently and rebuilding my first ever good deck has reminded me why I fell in love with this game to begin with. I just hope I'm able to play this deck once at a local before its gone."

I incorporated Yuri's new support into his deck since he didn't have a full 40 card deck in the Yugioh Arc V series. Yuri had two decks in the series an ancient gear one and a Predaplant one. This updated deck focuses on both of his Predaplant and Honor Student Ancient Gear Deck. My Character decks are NOT meant for yugioh official tournaments.

Before you click away, I didn't go over 40 for my reasons. <ul>  	<li>Nibiru: In this format, there are so many combo decks that this is a staple. Play at 3.</li>  	<li>Destiny Hero Plasma: This is your backup plan in case you go first. It does have only 1900 attack but a skill drain is nothing to laugh at. Also above level 4 so you can use it for dark calling fodder. Play at one, however.</li>  	<li>Honest Neos: Helps in otks and if needed can be used for fodder for dark calling.</li>  	<li>Malicious: Overall needed at 2. This helps so much with your combos if  It also can be banished for dark calling.</li>  	<li>Faris: 2 monsters on board,  a poly searched, and 2 monsters in gy. Fodder for calling. Must have at 3</li>  	<li>Adusted Gold: Discard for dark calling. Your evil hero can't fuse without this. However, you are going to run one dark fusion as anymore I feel is a brick.</li>  	<li>Stratos: Your searcher for the entire deck. Run at 3.</li>  	<li>Celestial: Dystopia Fodder and a draw 2 if you have no cards in your hand. However, a brick otherwise. Run at 1.</li>  	<li>Liquid Soldier: Special summons from your graveyard and if used as fusion material... allows a draw 2 discard 1. Run at 1 because there are better pieces out there.</li>  	<li>Solid Soldier: Special Summons from hand and if sent by a spell effect (Polymerization) allows you to bring back a hero in defense. Again run at 1.</li>  	<li>Shadow Mist: If sent to gy... allows to search a hero. If special summoned... allows to search mask change. Put at 3.</li>  	<li>Vyon: Sends a hero to gy (most of the time shadow mist). Banishes one monster from gy to add a poly. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Increase: While in spell and trap zone you can tribute a monster to special summon it. If you do this you can special summon another vision hero from the deck. Run at 2, could be changed.</li>  	<li>E- Emergency call: Also a searcher. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Dark calling: A miracle fusion that can summon mali bane. Run at one as it is easily searchable</li>  	<li>Poly: Nothing to say at this except searchable. Run at 1</li>  	<li>Reinforcement: Another searcher. Run as much as possible</li>  	<li>Miracle Fusion: Banishes from gy to summon. Searched from sunrise so run at 1.</li>  	<li>Fusion Destiny: Neos fusion without the restriction. Run at 3</li>  	<li>Mask change: Think of this like a quick play fusion summons using one monster. It special summons the same attribute. Watch for that.</li>  	<li>Called by the grave: Anti Eldlich and protects you from hand traps. Run at 3</li> </ul> </li> </ul> EXTRA DECK <ul>  	<li>Mali Bane: Untargetable removal that gains attack when it removes. Protected from getting destroyed.</li>  	<li>Dystopia: Summoned with fusion destiny. 1600 burn dmg and can destroy if attack is different then 2800.</li>  	<li>Adoration: Underclock taker</li>  	<li>Acid: Removes all spells and traps when it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Escuridao: Gains 100 atk for every hero in your gy.</li>  	<li>Absolute Zero: Removes all monsters when it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Sunrise: Monsters you control gain 200 ATK for each different Attribute you control as well as when it is summoned, it searches a miracle fusion and when another hero attacks you can target and destroy one card on the field.</li>  	<li>Dark Law: A macro cosmos for their field and when a card is added to their hand... you can banish one random card from their hand. I run this at 2 because there are a lot of darks in your deck.</li>  	<li>Blast: When summoned halfs an opponent's monster's attack. You can pay 500 lp once per turn (quick effect) to return an opponent's spell/trap to hand.</li>  	<li>Dangerous: A mill.</li>  	<li>Dread Decimator: This card, also any hero monsters it points to, gains 100 ATK for each hero monster with different names in your gy.</li>  	<li>Wonder Driver: Reuses your miracle fusion or poly.</li>  	<li>Cross Crusader: Revives a destiny hero from gy. Run at 2.</li> </ul> You can side out Nibiru for dark ruler in case of any negate boards. Sad thing is that you don't deal any damage after it resolves. However, it is better to be able to try to destroy their board. Twin in case of mystic mine. Lightning Storm because it is nice removal. If they are not running handtraps.... :/ cmon. You can side it out for infinite impermanence.  &nbsp;"

With the new Dragma archetype coming out next month, I think they can work well as a rogue strategy. Mostly using the older Lunalight strategy of actually fusion summoning, and using the Dragma cards to send Lunalight Cat/Panther Dancer to the graveyard, and using Wolf to fusion summon using the graveyard. While it's not perfect, and there are better archetypes to splash Dragma with, I think this will be the best way to use Lunalights in the future."

Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel,This is my deck from the 2003 Gamboy Advance game <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel</em>.  There wasn't a limited list in the game so I have multiple versions of cards that were limited at the time I played the game in 2003; including 3 copies of Pot of Greed and Graceful Charity.  My strategy was basically the same as my real life deck by relying on powerful level 4 monsters and on spell and trap card effects to destroy the opponents cards with very little draw back to me.  I tried to use the password system on every card in my real life deck but some wouldn't work.  Also Ring of Destruction is in the game as Bell of Destruction.

At that time, advanced format was dominated by the Nekroz Archetype, before Konami decided to enter the stage with a flood of bans, in a successful attempt to rebalance the metagame.  As time went by and game evolved, new sets were released with ever greater cards each time, ultimately leading Konami to reconsider its banlist, and set free the Nekroz top cards one after the other: Shurit … Brionac … until very recently, when <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> finally got back to three!  <strong>Now that the deck can (almost) be played at full power, I thought it would be interesting to share some knowledge on the Nekroz mechanics &amp; strategies, that may seem a bit obscure at first glance. Hence this extensive guide covering various aspects of the deck, as well as some insight on my personal build. Hope you like it.</strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/d/d6/Mat-YOT-Nekroz.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20150330032038"" width=""743"" height=""415"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Foreword:</u></strong></span>  Nowadays, there is a widespread decklist of the Nekroz that is often featured on Youtube. I invite you to check the following link first, in order to see by yourself: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-tBsd1JpOg</a>. Admittedly, this variant is much more explosive thanks to its insane 1-card combo generating an impressive card advantage. However, despite the “hype”, and after having extensively tested both versions, I still think the Impcantation build is better. Let me briefly outline the main reasons behind this statement: <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 0</a><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">03</a>, the combo starter, is not searchable:</strong> if you do not draw it, you drastically decrease your chances of winning the duel because your entire build is oriented (artificially skewed) towards this particular combo, and therefore less efficient in every other scenario.</li>  	<li><strong>Tons of hard bricks:</strong> two <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a>, one <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a>, and one <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> (to a lesser extent), and you still need to play with a 40-card deck if you want to open <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> more often. There is a 42.71% probability to open at least one brick in your starting hand (4 bricks / proba going first / 5 cards in hand), and still a 33.76% proba if you do not count Kristya. That means at least one out of 3 starting hands, which is not negligible.</li>  	<li><strong>Destroyed by hand trap:</strong> if the combo is shut down only once, it is “end of turn”. Deskbot 003 into Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring = “GG” and I am not being sarcastic. Some will say: “yes but it is the same for any combo if stopped properly, right?”. Not quite actually, many combos rely on various extenders and can still survive a hand trap, while other can at least adapt themselves and achieve decent end boards while being disrupted. There is no such possibility in this case.</li>  	<li><b>Nibiru incoming: </b>Even though the combo includes a <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> early on (negate ability), it is still too late to avoid <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, which will not hesitate to crush your board whenever it can.</li>  	<li><strong>The deck needs to run 3x <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> to protect against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. Should you want to have a “high” chance to go through your entire combo, you would need <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> + CBG in hand (both not searchable). This leads to a probability of only 23.72% of drawing them (going first / 5 cards in hand), meaning 1 chance out of 4. Adding the proba of being Nibiru’ed, it does not fly… And you also have to take into account this combo can almost only be performed going first (would be countered otherwise) which once again reduces your chances of achieving it.</li>  	<li><strong>Conclusion: this really is a trade-off scenario:</strong> <em>are you willing to sacrifice stability for a powerful combo which will most likely win you the game if properly conducted?</em> I would say this is a high risk/high reward dilemma, but I myself would rather bet on consistency on the long run. Overall, too many flaws in my opinion that drastically decrease the real chances of going through your combo.</li> </ul> <strong><u>If you disagree, I would very much like to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!</u></strong>  <strong><em>That being said, let me guide you through the mysteries of the Nekroz…</em></strong>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Unmatchable Search Engine: </strong>It is so powerful… it might even destabilize beginners who won’t know where to start! <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>, on its own, enables you to access ANY Nekroz card, either directly, or through another layer of search thanks to <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>. Let’s not forget <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>’s second ability, which can also retrieve from grave by discarding itself.  <strong>Consistent as Hell: </strong>Add the “Impcantation” package and ridiculous spells such as <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> to the Nekroz core engine, and you get a deck thanks to which pretty much any hand can get you what you want. I really mean it, the deck is so stable (no bricks at all), you will often feel overwhelmed by the plethora of options available to you.  <strong>Absolute Power Plays:</strong> <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a> effects are game changers: Trishula will grant you a huge card advantage while Unicore’s Extra-Deck Lock will shut down most of the strategies of your opponent if not dealt with.  <strong>Highly Versatile:</strong> You can choose whether you prefer to go 1st or 2nd… and that is pure luxury! I certainly built this deck with a “going 2nd” approach in mind (even though <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> is a turn 1 option), but you can aslo decide to start the duel if you feel the need to, depending on the deck you are facing. This build can clearly adapt and compete in both scenarios.  <strong>Very Resilient: </strong>So many searchers in the deck = not too difficult to sail through a sea of negates &amp; interruptions while developing your strategy “seamlessly”. Many ways to bait your opponent &amp; resolve crucial cards.  <strong>Double Trouble!</strong> Nekroz have a huge impact on board, that’s for sure. What if I told you they can be even better when kept in hand? All Nekroz come up with two effects: one that activates on the field, and the second one from hand. Nekroz of Trishula negates effects that target your other Nekroz monsters, while <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> acts like a <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a>, ending the battle phase right after being discarded, an ability that will help you a lot to stall the game and buy some time.  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/banned-camp/images/6/68/Brio.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190907235634"" width=""496"" height=""496"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Weaknesses:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Ritual Summoning Condition: </strong>Obviously, Ritual Summon is not the easiest way to summon a monster in Yu-Gi-Oh. And the restrictive conditions regarding the level of the tributes will force you to think twice before making a move. Fortunately, Impcantations are a blessing for this deck (and any other ritual-based deck) and make it much easier to summon your favorites creatures!  <strong>Search-Lock Effects: </strong>I said in the previous section that this deck worked a bit like an open bar, where you can pick any card you want with ease. However, every Nekroz player loathes cards that prevent you from searching directly from deck. <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> or <a data-name=""Mistake"">Mistake</a>, to name a few, will haunt your worst nightmares…! In the current metagame (July 2020 – MR5) dominated by Adamancipator and Eldlich, these cards are not prevalent (even in sides), so don’t worry too much.  <strong>Over-Passivity:</strong> On your opponent’s turn, you can defend yourself, but you cannot actively interrupt his/her plays with the Nekroz engine at all. You will rely on your “going 2nd” cards and hand traps to do so. You have no negates available, no removal that can be activated during his/her turn.  <strong>No Signature Trap?</strong> If you read Nekroz cards carefully, you probably noticed some of them mentioned traps in their description (such as Clausolas), but no Nekroz trap has ever been released so far. Maybe Konami thought it was not necessary considering the huge impact of the archetype on the game when it first came out. Nowadays though, almost every archetype as its negating trap, and I would be glad if Nekroz had one. Famous examples are: <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a>, <a data-name=""Orcust Crescendo"">Orcust Crescendo</a> etc…  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Strategy:</u></strong></span>  <strong><u>Main Objective:</u></strong> <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Vanity’s Ruler"">Vanity’s Ruler</a> on board --&gt; Prevent your opponent from special summoning + Negate all effects of monsters summoned from the Extra Deck // Trishula + Valkyrus in hand --&gt; Protection from targeting effects (Trishula Negate ability) &amp; Protection from battle (Valkyrus ends battle phase).  Most often, you will want to ritual summon <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> with <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>, sending a <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to the grave in order to add any ritual card directly from your deck to your hand. <strong>I would consider this play as the main generic move you will surely repeat over and over, against a great variety of deck, when playing Nekroz.</strong>  If your opponent does not use the Extra Deck (Monarch Archetype for instance), change of plan: obviously, you should go 2nd against such decks, BUT, if your opponent lets you start, THEN: try to XYZ <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a> for a rank 4 play --&gt; I suggest <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>. And make sure you end the turn with Valk in hand. Bagooska will prevent any monster effect from activating on the field, and Valk will keep your health points safe. Do not try to build any sort of “Nekroz-related” board (Brionac or Clausolas or Valkyrus or anything else on turn one), it is useless. Your powerful Nekroz are meant to be unleashed on turn 2. Protect yourself, try to stay alive one more turn, and only start building up your offensive the turn after.  <strong><u>Main Combo when Going 1st:</u></strong>  You can achieve same end board with multiple combinations. The sequencing is primordial.  <strong><a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> + <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> + <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> in hand</strong> <ul>  	<li>Reveal Unicore, use Chalislime effect into Talismandra effect into Cyber Angel Benten in hand</li>  	<li>Brionac discard into Clausolas discard into Kaleidoscope in hand</li>  	<li>Ritual Summon Unicore with Kaleidoscope dumping Herald to Grave</li>  	<li>Add Cycle from deck with Herald’s effect</li>  	<li>Use Cycle to revive Brionac from grave dumping Benten to grave</li>  	<li>Use Benten effect to add Vanity’s Ruler from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Vanity by tributing Talismandra and Brionac</li> </ul> <strong>--&gt;</strong> Preparation of Rites OR any impcantation can also provide you with a piece of the combo. Pretty much all your cards are combo pieces at this point &#x1f609;  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/3/34/LawofLight-WC08.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110617020416"" width=""453"" height=""340"" alt=""image"" />  <strong><u>When Going 2nd:</u></strong>  Take down your opponent defenses one by one and build up your own board: <ul>  	<li>Evenly Matched &amp; Super Poly to wipe their board</li>  	<li>Summon your Boss Monster Trishula to banish exactly 3 key cards from hand, field and grave</li>  	<li>Summon Valkyrus to draw by tributing your impcantations, and refill your hand</li>  	<li>Summon Unicore to negate effects from annoying monsters</li>  	<li>Summon Brionac to shuffle back up to two monsters summoned from the Extra Deck</li>  	<li>Swing for game, you can even super poly your own Nekroz during battle phase for extra damage --&gt; Example: Super Poly Brionac &amp; Unicore for Mudragon = +1900 ATK for lethal!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Rationale Behind Ratios:</u></strong></span>  <strong><u>Nekroz Core Engine:</u></strong>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a>:</strong> Nothing to discuss here, 3 is mandatory.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>:</strong> Idem, at 3 since the last banlist, adding a lot consistency to your opening hands.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a>:</strong> Can be searched via Brionac, no need to play at 3. You can even consider playing only 1.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a>:</strong> 3x would be a little too much (arguable), you do not want to open it, but you definitely want to end your turn with it. 1x is not enough. You need at least one to end the battle phase, and another one to recycle your dead draws &amp; Impcantations on board. It is also a strong body.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>:</strong> I main only one, but I also have another copy on my side deck. Usually, you first summon it through Mirror, and then with Cycle (from grave). However, I sometimes need two in order to deal with huge threats or powerful continuous spell/traps.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Decisive Armor"">Nekroz of Decisive Armor</a>:</strong> Personal tech choice (most of the time swapped in game 2 for Trish if not needed). Can be very helpful to break the 3000th ATK wall. None of your Nekroz can beat a <a data-name=""Blue-eyes White Dragon"">Blue-eyes White Dragon</a> which is annoying. And I guarantee you, you should not neglect that. You will sooner or later find yourself in a spot where you would just need a slightly higher ATK monster to make the difference and win the duel. Furthermore, its ability to destroy AND banish any set card, as well as its Honest-like ability in hand make this card a very versatile option to consider. This card is usually underrated in my view.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz"">Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</a>:</strong> I tried him at x3, it was too bricky. I tried him at 2x, could came in handy, but most of the time, I felt like the second copy was too much. 1x is fine according to me: Shurit can be searched with Brionac (so technically, you have 4x). You want to use it once from hand, and you can even use it twice thanks to Mirror, so it seems enough.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>:</strong> When Unicore was limited, I would only play one. Now that it is at 3x, 2x Kaleidoscope feels right as it is the principal option you will use to summon Unicore.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Nekroz Cycle"">Nekroz Cycle</a>:</strong> Best Nekroz ritual spell, helps you a lot in late game.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz Mirror"">Nekroz Mirror</a>:</strong> The most situational ritual spell, you will almost every time use it to summon Trishula by banishing Brionac and Clausolas OR Shurit from grave.  <strong>Remark: </strong>All these ritual spells are searchable via Clausolas, so you do not need a playset. It would be way too much.  <strong><u>Impcantation Package:</u></strong>  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>:</strong> Best Impcantation, you want to open it, but you do not play enough other Impcantations to run 3x copies. 2x is enough. The third one would most likely end up dead in hand.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a>:</strong> Talismandra into search for Brionac or Unicore is the most common play. You never want to open this card so 3x is too much. It needs to be special summoned with one of  its mates.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a>/ 1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> / 1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">Impcantation Bookston</a><a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">e: </a></strong>Best scenario is to open one of them and special summon Talismandra. You could replace one Bookstone (the less useful) for one other Pencilplume, to improve your late game. I prefer to run one of each in order to diversify my draws and options.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>:</strong> I see too many people running more than 1. This is wrong. This card is searchable and can even be easily retrieved from grave. What’s more, there is already 5 other ritual spells in the deck which is almost too much. With 6 ritual spells, you have a 57.71% chance to open at least one (going first / 5 cards in hand). Let’s say you want to add 2 more, proba would therefore rise to 69.40%, more than 2/3, whereas you do not want to see them in your hand!! 6 ritual cards already account for 15% of your deck, this is huge!! Be very careful about bad ratios, they can totally ruin your chances of winning.  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/f/fc/Impcantation.png/revision/latest?cb=20181014043418"" width=""452"" height=""454"" alt=""image"" />  <strong><u>Rest of the deck:</u></strong>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>:</strong> Best spell in the deck, 3x is mandatory. How come this card is still at 3x? Thanks Konami!  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a>:</strong> grants you one ritual search, enables XYZ rank 4 plays with Unicore, is your only normal summon except from Vanity’s ruler. 3x is a must.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>:</strong> particularly effective in Nekroz since you never have to set any trap.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>:</strong> generic hand trap. Replace it depending on the state of the meta.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> / 1x <a data-name=""Vanity’s Ruler"">Vanity’s Ruler</a>:</strong> for the combo play. No need for more copies, both are searchable. Why Ruler instead of Kristya? Kristya's special summoning condition is too hard to meet, you will never use it... and downside is it also prevent YOU from special summoning. Impcantations make it so easy to normal summon Ruler that I do not see any reason not to play it.  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Useful Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>’s effect states “banish EXACTLY 3 cards”, there is a restriction that <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> does not have. Keep in mind if your opponent has no card in hand, the effect won’t activate at all!</li>  	<li>When sequencing your plays, do not forget (if possible) to play <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> after having already summoned a Nekroz, in order to retrieve the ritual spell used from grave.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> can bounce back monsters that were special summoned from THE EXTRA DECK. Do not extrapolate this statement. If an XYZ, Synchro, Fusion etc… monster has been summoned via <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for instance, Brionac’s ability won’t trigger.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a>’s recycling ability can be used by tributing monsters from your HAND, not only your FIELD.</li>  	<li>Do not forget, you are locked into summoning from the Extra Deck if you have an impcantation on board.</li>  	<li>Remember you need to reveal a specific card from your hand before playing any Impcantation. Always think about it before making any other play and realizing right after you cannot fulfill the requirement anymore!</li>  	<li>Brionac into Clausolas into Nekroz Mirror = you can invoke Trishula by banishing from grave the two above-mentioned creatures.</li>  	<li>Bear in mind your ritual spells have effects in grave that require you NOT HAVING any monster on the field to trigger.</li>  	<li>If you opt for the Manju play, you will not be able to summon Vanity. Be warned!</li>  	<li>If you do not ritual summon after using Chalislime's effect, you will lose 2000 HP, ouch!!</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> can only be discarded by banishing a Nekorz card from grave!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Extra Deck:</u></strong></span>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>:</strong> to get a free ritual card out of Kaleido/Unicore.  <strong>2x <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a>:</strong> to destroy a card out of Kaleido/Unicore.  <strong>Super Poly Targets:</strong> Classics include <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> and <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>. The latest can also be used on your own monsters, as I explained previously.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Number 41 Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41 Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>:</strong> to slow down your opponent, survive until turn 2.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>:</strong> emergency option ... to nuke the board!  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>:</strong> for the very late game, to reload your deck (very rarely used).  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>:</strong> if you face a deck abusing effects from grave.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shooting Quasar Dragon"">Shooting Quasar Dragon</a>:</strong> any level 12 will do fine (<a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a>, yes, you can finally use this ultimate beast!): level 12 = 2x Brionac OR Valk + Unicore OR Trish + Clausolas with Kaleidoscope.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Star Eater"">Star Eater</a>:</strong> any level 11 will do fine: level 11 = Valk + Clausolas with Kaleidoscope.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Shooting Star Dragon"">Shooting Star Dragon</a>:</strong> any level 10 will do fine: level 10 = Unicore + Brionac with Kaleidoscope.  <img class="""" src=""https://roadoftheking.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ro3rd-Nekroz-LA-WCQ-National-2015-Playmat.jpg"" width=""678"" height=""394"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Side Deck:</u></strong></span>  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Super Polymerization""><strong>S</strong>uper Polymerization</a>:</strong> you have some free space in your Extra Deck, so why not using it? Another strong way to avoid negates and get rid of your opponent’s monsters.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>:</strong> very helpful against backrows, as the Nekroz engine does not contain that many removals. And very op, come on!  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>:</strong> break monster-based lockdowns, avoid negation. Useful against combo decks abusing Halqifibrax and building powerful end boards.  <strong>3x <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: </strong>tons of combo decks out there that cannot play against Nibiru. Best way to wreck their board.  <strong>1x <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>:</strong> whenever you think one is not enough. For late game, against control decks.  <strong>--&gt;</strong> The rest is up to you, depends on the meta as usual. 2x Twin Twisters, 2x Cosmic Cyclone, 2x D.D. Crow etc…  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Other options to consider:</u></strong></span>  <strong><a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a>:</strong> already mentioned in the foreword section of this guide. I am not a fan, but very explosive &amp; impressive combo involving <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> (no joke!?). If you feel luck is on your side, go for it!  <strong>The Zaborg Dilemma:</strong> I tested a lot <a data-name=""Zaborg The Mega Monarch"">Zaborg The Mega Monarch</a>, and I must say I have mixed feelings regarding its viability for (semi-)competitive play. Its effect is very strong, no doubt, but the conditions required to benefit from it seem quite huge to me. It also comes with its share of drawbacks: It is not searchable, it uses your normal summon, and therefore collides with Manju and Vanity. It helps deplete your opponent’s extra deck, but you can already rely on Unicore to do the job (a bit redundant). You need to tribute a LIGHT monster in order to choose which cards you send to GY from the opponent’s Extra Deck --&gt; it means you would have to reconsider and adjust your impcantation ratios in a way that would not be optimal otherwise. Can sometimes end up dead in hand, especially if you draw it after turn 1.  For fun/casual play however, I would highly recommend giving it a try, as you can potentially have access to some sick combos if you combine Zaborg with <a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a> and specific Extra Deck monsters. <strong>Let me know in the comments if you would like more information.</strong>  <strong>Splashing Dragma:</strong> the new Dragma Archetype which will make its debut in the “Rise of the Duellist” set (only available in OCG at the moment), will most likely redefine the way we play Nekroz. I do not want to elaborate on this topic. One thing at a time, mastering the actual version of the deck is already quite complicated.  <strong><a data-name=""Nekroz of Gungnir"">Nekroz of Gungnir</a>:</strong> I first included it in my side deck but decided to replace it with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Decisive Armor"">Nekroz of Decisive Armor</a> which comes up more often. Good removal overall that can find its place in the side deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a>: </strong>very good in this build, enables to replenish your Impcantation engine by shuffling back Talismandra in your deck. Benten and Brionac are also great targets.  <strong><a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>:</strong> can search for Unicore and Shurit, but there’s so many searchers already, do you really need one more? Maybe...  <strong>Any other suggestions let me know!</strong>  <strong><u><img src=""https://d1rw89lz12ur5s.cloudfront.net/photo/gamekeeperonline/file/516823/large/$_1.jpg?1473964873"" alt=""image"" /></u></strong>  <strong>If you are one of those who’ve read this far… well, thank you! </strong>I hope this guide has facilitated understanding of many key aspects of the Nekroz, and clarified most of the dark spots surrounding these mysterious knights possessed by the spirit of the dragon!  <strong>Here are some other deck profiles you might like:</strong>  <em>Phantasms’ Awakening – How to tame the Sacred Beasts!</em> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/phantasms-awakening-how-to-tame-the-sacred-beasts/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/phantasms-awakening-how-to-tame-the-sacred-beasts/</a>  <em>Nostalgy Time – An Extensive Guide on How to Play Toons </em><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/nostalgy-time-an-extensive-guide-on-how-to-play-toons/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/nostalgy-time-an-extensive-guide-on-how-to-play-toons/</a>  <strong><em>Lightning</em></strong>"

These struggles lie in the past though, as the generic Union Carrier is able to provide an easy 1000 ATK boost. That is not all however, as the only non-Level 1 monster in the deck, Valkyrie Chariot is conveniently a Wind monster and raises the ATK of an equipped monster further by 500 per attack. This means, that 6 materials on field are an OTK.</span>  <span><strong>Components</strong></span>  <span>Lyrilusc Core: Standard 3 of each, since they are still the best LV1 engine and provide beneficial effects as Xyz Materials.</span>  <span>Appliancer Engine: 3 Socketroll, Copybukkle and World and 1 Kappa in ED. The one Kappa enables you use Worlds recovery to get back a Socketroll, so World plus any of the other two equals 4 usable materials.</span>  <span>Normal Summons: 2 Kepler into Gate into Lamia, who can also be used from Grave and send from hand, so it's not too bricky. Only 2 Kinka-Byo because it need setup and Normal Summoning Socketroll nets more pluses.</span>  <span>Generic LV1 Extenders: 3 Booster and Jester.</span>  <span>Other Spells: One for One and Where Arf Thou? (obviously), Instant Fusion 'cause Millennium-Eyes stops Ash and it can summon Independent, Foolish for Warbler, Kinka-Byo and Lamia, and Lightning Storm because going second.</span>  <span>Extra: Worth mentioning are 2 Independent Nightingale because of Instant Fusion, Proxy to access it MP2, and Gravity Controller to turn Recital Starling into Carrier material. Also 1 arrogant Bird, buys you a turn if needed.</span>  <span>Side Deck: DS to raise your ceiling when forced to go first and Harpie's Feather Storm for the same occasion.</span>"

It's been a while with a bunch of Banlist changes that greatly affected the deck for the better. Tenyi Yang Zing (TYZ) is a deck that's main focus is on card advantage. Card advantage is how TYZ is able to get a leg up on other decks and overwhelm them Non-effect monsters and synchros. The main play of the deck is to use one of the 3 one card starters (Souleating Oviraptor, Draconnet, Mathematican) to synchro summon Denglong and search Nine Pillars (Pro tip don't set backrow until you search Nine Pillars to ensure your opponent doesn't know where you set it). Then afterwords, use Denglong's effect to send a Tenyi from deck to GY (the best one to send, most of the time, is Ashuna) (BTW the level change isn't that important). Then on the opponent's turn negate something with Pillars and off of denlong being sent to GY summon Bi'an, then you revive Denlong with either Buddy Force or Back to the Front, use denlong to search Yang Zing Path (for card advantage), and when you see an opportunity use Bi'an to synchro with Denlong into Baxia and shuffle 2 cards on the opponent's field (Pro tip don't chain Bi'an to a card effect because if you do Baxia will miss timing, also Bi'an gives Baxia battle protection). That's the main bread and butter combo of the Deck that's a +2 in card advantage and gives you a way to recycle the Yang Zings (and draw 2) and puts a Tenyi in the GY. The new stuff include an unlimited copy of Vessel for the Dragon Cycle without having to add 5 extra cards to my deck to meet the trinity requirement. And because of that I cut the World Legacy package since Baxia is good enough removal and I needed space for Crystron Halqifibrax (which helps get denglong on the board even with super bricky hands). And Miscellaneousaurus is another target to send for soul just in case you already burned Carboneddon or hard drew it."

Banishing? Resurrection? Locking down the board? The DM deck you never knew you needed is HERE!,"This deck centers around using Dark Magician, Eternal Soul, and Dark Magic Circle, with the purpose of banishing your opponents cards as well as other independent supplements meant to make dueling you a living hell. It dominates in casual play and, with a couple card change-ups, is also very competitive in tournament play.  <strong>Basic strategy</strong>: Eternal Soul and Dark Magical Circle are continuous traps and spells respectively. DMC allows you to look at the top 3 cards in your deck and select 1 that is Dark Magician related and add it to your hand immediately. Then you can choose the order of the other 2 cards. 2nd effect: When Dark Magician is summoned to the field, banish an opponent's card. This effect can be done multiple times per turn. Eternal Soul is your DM summoning engine. Once during either turn, you can Special Summon a DM from your hand or deck, thus activating DMC's effect. It doesn't matter if DM is destroyed, cause he'll just come back to banish. Plus ES guards your DM from any card effects.  <strong>Banishment engine support Cards</strong>: Soul Servant, Metalfoes Fusion, Magician's Rod, Foolish Burial Goods, Dark Illusion, and Card Destruction. These are all meant to either help you draw those top 3 cards, or search them directly from your deck. More details below.  <strong>Search engine</strong>: Use these cards to specifically search out DMC, ES, and/or DM directly from your deck.  Magician's Rod allows you to add any spell or trap to your hand upon Normal Summon (use to search for DMC or ES). If in the graveyard, you can tribute your Dark Magician to the graveyard to place Rod back in your hand, setting you up for another spell/trap search and DM special summon/banish combo next turn.  Soul Servant: Allows you to place any DM-related card at the top of your deck, ready for your next draw. Then, you can banish this to the GY and if you have DM on field or graveyard, draw that card. If you have both DM and DM Girl in field or graveyard, you can draw twice! Because it's a quick-play, you can basically activate this whenever you want. Use with DMC to guarantee a card you want (like ES!)  Foolish Burial Goods: Sets you up for your draw engine by sending Soul Servant, Magician Navigation, or Metalfoes Fusion from your deck to the graveyard. See draw engine section below.  Magician's Souls: Discard this from your hand to send DM directly from the deck to the GY, then special summon a DM to the field (why wait for that pesky draw?). Also use it to dump DM Girl to draw 2 cards after banishing Soul Servant.  Illusion Magic: Tribute any spellcaster from your field to search 2 DMs and add them to your hand (combo by tributing DM to bring him back for a banish later or tribute Rod so that Rod can come back to your hand for another Summon/search combo on your next turn).  <strong>Draw Engine: </strong>Another way to get your DMC, ES, and DM combo into your hand as fast as possible, if you don't have any search cards.  Soul Servant: See above. Dump DM Girl and DM into the GY, before using this, to draw 2 cards (this is literally the only reason DM Girl is in your deck).  Metalfoes: We don't care about Metalfoes fusion summoning, only its draw effect. Use Foolish Burial Goods to dump this into your GY, then you can shuffle it back into your deck and draw a card.  Card Destruction: Currently limited to 1 in official gameplay rules, but if you're playing for fun, run 3. You know the feeling of drawing a crappy hand? Any deck suffers from this from time to time. Use Card Destruction to dump it and draw a new hand (with the added bonus of putting cards like DM, DM Girl, Soul Servant, and Metalfoes into the GY). If you're an official player, run 2 Spellbook of Secrets to search Spellbook of Knowledge to draw 2 cards.  Magician's Souls: When this card is on your field, you can ditch 1 or 2 spell/trap cards from your hand or field to the GY and then draw that many cards. I don't use this affect that much, but it's there if you need it.  <strong>Additional DM support:</strong> Other cards not focused on your revival/banishment engine, but their tricks add another layer of offensive and defensive flexibility. Includes Secret Village of Spellcasters, Magician of Dark Illusions, Apprentice Illusion Magician, Palladium Oracle Mahad, Eye of Timaeus, Secrets of Dark Magic, and Magician Navigation  Secret of  Spellcasters: Lock down your opponent's board. As long as you have a spellcaster on the field, they can't use their spells.  Magician of Dark Illusions: A supplement to your standard DM. This card is great because it's name becomes DM while on the field, allowing you more DMs to use with DMC. While you can't revive it with ES, it's great for summoning directly from your hand if you activate a spell/trap on your opponents turn. Say you have DMC on the field, but no ES yet. Just activate another spell/trap during your opponents turn to bring this out from your hand and get a quick banish on them, disrupting their strategy. I can't tell you how much more flexibility this card offers you. It's even a lvl 7, which will be important later on.  Apprentice Illusion Magician and Palladium Oracle Mahad: These are the jacks of all trades! They're powerful beatsticks that are ridiculously easy to special summon from your hand and have killer effects. AIM pulls DM from deck to your hand when you summon her, and you can tribute her to give another magician an extra 2000 Atk/Def! Mahad can double his Atk points when fighting a Dark monster, and if he's destroyed, you can special summon DM from hand, deck, or grave.  Eye of Timaeus and Secrets of Dark Magic: Activate these to bring out your Fusion monsters. Easily searchable with Soul Servant or Magician's Rod. Timaeus requires you to only have 1 DM on the field (easy!) and Secrets needs you to have both Fusion materials, but they can stay in your hand instead of exposed on the field.  Magician Navigation: Great for summoning a DM straight from your hand and another from your deck (setting you up for multiple banishments or an XYZ or Fusion Summon). It's 2nd effect is arguably more useful though, allowing you to negate an opponent's spell/trap card's effect for that turn.  <strong>Additional support:</strong> Same purpose as your DM support: lockdown your opponent from countering or effectively implementing their own strategies. These allow you to be more proactive in your offense and defense: Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, Solemn Judgment, and Gozen Match. Alternatives include Skill Drain, Twin Twisters, or Solemn Strike/Solemn Warning  Ash Blossom: Discard to negate a summon or search effect. Sometimes your opponent needs that one card to get their strategy going. Deny them that with this card  Infinite Imperm: Your opponent's monster effect making things hard for you? Use this to negate that effect for a turn, as well as a spell/trap effect.  Solemn Judgment: Sacrifice half your life points to activate this?!?! What?! Trust me, you'll need this. It's a counter trap, so only counter traps can counter it, so you're basically guaranteed to cancel out whatever it is your opponent is planning and destroy it. Disrupting them from summoning their trump monster or ace spell/trap is worth half your LP, cause if you don't, you'll lose a lot more than that.  Gozen Match: My personal favorite. Each player can only control 1 attribute of monsters while this card is in play. This is perfect for you because most of your monsters are Dark anyways. And against decks where multiple attributes are used, it's a nightmare. *Note: You won't be able to use certain Extra Deck monsters and Mahad if this is active on your field.  <strong>Fusion Monsters:</strong>  DM the Dragon Knight: Your biggest challenge is going to be protecting DMC and ES while they're active, because your opponent will definitely target them. This giant beatstick boasts 3000 Atk AND protects your spells and traps from any card effects. Also, it's name becomes DM on the field or GY, so it benefits from your DMC and ES combo as well!!! Summon this, and ES protects it from any card effects and it protects all your spells/traps from effects as well. The only way for your opponent to attack your field is with a monster with +3000 Atk, and even then, you can always just bring it back with ES. Broken.  The Dark Magicians: Also very useful effect, allowing you to draw 1 card for every effect activated. If it's a spell/trap, you can set it and/or activate it right then and there, depending on the type of spell or trap. And if it's destroyed, special summon DM and DM Girl from hand deck or graveyard to set off DMC's effect as revenge.  When Dragun of Red-Eyes comes out, you will also want that in your Extra Deck for sure! If you need Fusions with just raw attack power, consider Amulet Dragon, Dark Paladin, and Dark Cavalry. Their effects are more limited, but they can shine in terms of brute strength.  <strong>Xyz</strong>: Red Eyes Flare Metal Dragon, Number 11: Big Eye, and Ebon Illusion Magician. All of these are lvl 7 Xyz (and you conveniently have 6 lvl 7 monsters that can be easily put on the field at the same time. Ebon Illusion Magician is especially useful for this deck, allowing you to special summon spellcasters and have a banishing effect of its own! Your next most useful Xyz is Red-Eyes, oddly enough. It'll further lock down your opponent by inflicting 500 LP damage every time they activate a card or effect. Your opponent must choose: carry out their strategy at the expense of their LP, or save their LP at the expense of taking any action against you. Big Eye simply lets you take control of an opponents monster permanently. Ebon High Magician is also an option if you want, as well as Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack for link summoning (though this is a Wind-type)  <strong>Links: </strong>I don't really know how to use Links that much, but you can definitely include some. I'd keep DM the Dragon Knight, The DMs, Dragun of Red Eyes (when it comes out), Ebon Illusion, Red Eyes, and Big Eye as essentials. They others can be switched out for Link monsters if you want.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

By combining the Subterror Guru stringent strategy with the obvious stringency of floodgates, you can arise the highest level of control ever imagined in the game. Playing there can be only one at 3 and Gozen Match at 2, you can lock your oponent out of all the combos and strategies that imply monsters of the same type or different atributes. Furthermore the deck is designed to adapt the strategy to the oponent's deck by removing from the main deck the floodgate which isn't useful against an archetype (i.e: Playing against slamangreat you should remove gozen match as all the Salamangreat monsters are fire type, so the card is basically a ""brick"") and introducing in the main deck nteresting cards for a control deck such as Ash Blossom, Crackdown, Super Polymerization or Skill drain. You can even introduce 2 evenly matched in case of going second, which might be a weakness of the deck if you don't control the tempo porperly.  Furthermore you play 2 copies of mystic mine (+ terraforming + set rotation) that might slow the game enough to help you to take control of the game in situations in which you don't draw the Subterror Guru (which is one of the main problems that could arise when playing this archetype).  And last, but not least, I have incorporated a card I consider hardly underrated by the competitive comunity that is Witch's Strike, with a lot of potential in a format in which the negations are so extended. If activated and resolved, you have many chances to win the duel."

The main idea of the deck is summoning as quick as possible a Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX dragon and a Blue-Eyes Chaos dragon to attack and make OTKs without worrying about possible rival responses due to the inherent protection of these monsters which makes them something really hard to deal with and with almost no response in the meta strategies as the high attack and their extremely powerfull defense (obvously due to their effect, not the defense stat which is 0 in both ritual monsters) forces your rival to go for very specific plays to remove them from the field: They cannot be destroyed by card effects... and they cannot be targeted!!!  Even though it is difficult to go through their defense, it is possible that your rival manages to get a response to the presence of these monsters on the field... However, this deck profile presents 5 cards (2 x solemn strike and 3 x The Ultimate creature of destruction). The Ultimate Creature of destruction makes a Blue-Eyes monster you control totally immune to any card effect and destruction by battle and the Solemn Strike can be used to avoid special summons that might cause you problems or monster effects that might become an incovenient such as the Borreload Dragon effect or the Topologic Zeroboros.  Last but not least, this deck profile is not limited to the main deck monsters and effects, the 3 copies of Number 97: Draglubion give you acces to all the other Number dragon monsters in the extra deck with amazing effects and strategies to look for the OTK in case that the main strategy of the deck doesn't work."

The main deck consist of the usual HERO goodstuff plus Avian and Burstinatrix. I use two Polys since the ideal stuff is to summon both Sunriser and Grandmerge. I also included a limited Plasma and Dark Law package for when you're required to go first, but make no mistake, this is a going-second beatdown strategy. There's only one of Adusted and Dark Calling each, but I feel that's enough given how easily searchable is.  It lacks in hand traps but makes up for it with plenty of S/T removal for floodgates and Called by the Grave for opposing hand traps since what you want is to get your combo through and not necessarily stop the opponent's.  The Extra Deck is where the real meat is. Our most important card is Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer, who will fetch our vanillas. Grandmerge and Inferno Wing will be our main beatsticks, usually paired with Sunriser. Once Grandmerge destroys a monster, you will tag out to Chaos (be wary of the level restriction!!). I chose Chaos as my prefered tag-out target given his useful negate, but you could make an argument fot not really needing it at that point. To be completely honest with you, I just like Chaos. You could also summon him with Poly or Miracle (yes, you can) given the right situation.  The rest is just more HERO goodstuff: Dark Law because Dark Law, Blast for S/T, Bane for an alternative Dark Calling summon, Absolute Zero/Acid combo for board wipe, Trinity for even more damage, and the rest of the Xtras for more combo and damage.  Lastly, the Side Deck is just ""other things you can use"" rather than an actually functional Side. Special attention to Nebula Neos who can also be summoned with Grandmerge and possibly give you some really sweet draw power.  If what you want is an actual Side Deck, just think of the usual: hand traps, Kaijus, etc."

It's even more consistent (just need 1 Prank-Kids monster), more powerful (non-target, wipes board, TWICE), and with the same recursion as ABC/Salamangreat. Heck it even fits with just only 1 Verte (more broken with 3 Verte tho, but Verte limits your ceiling at the same time).  Combo is standard, normal summon/ss random Prank-Kids (non-token tho), make Meow-Meow, use Prank-Kids gy effect ss another Prank-Kids (we need every Battle Butler material in gy/banished tho, Fansies sends other to gy, Rocksies banishes hand and draw), make Doodle-Doo, use Doodle-Doo chain Prank-Kids gy eff ss another Prank-Kids, add field spell for recursion or fusion spell to make link 4 (if we face backrow deck). If we face non-backrow-heavy deck, we can proceed to Verte, use field add Rocksies/Fansies (both are important), use Verte send Thunder Dragon Fusion by returning Battle Buttler material from banished/gy to deck, use field increasing 500 atk.  The recursion line needs Dragondark if with limited Verte, use Thunder Dragon Fusion gy eff add Dragondark, Rocksies banishes Dragondark for another Thunder Dragon Fusion, but you gotta trigger Fansies to meet Battle Butler material requirement in gy, proceed the same Prank-Kids way again and again lol.  Pros: ABC/Salamangreat level, but with tag-out ability.  Cons: Endboard is bad with only 1 meaningful monster.  PS: Thanks to Project Ignis discord"

The main focus of the deck is to turbo out <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dominance"">Destiny HERO - Dominance</a> with <a data-name=""D - Tactics"">D - Tactics</a> on the field in order to banish your opponents cards and bring all the D - Boys back.</span>  The main combo requires either <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a> or <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> in your hand with another monster to discard (without having <a data-name=""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a> in your hand since it turns off your combo). Normal summon either of the monsters, (Lonefire gets Scorpio from deck by tributing itself) use Scorpio's effect by discarding the monster in your hand (dont discard <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a>, or <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> unless you need to since their effect can be useful) to special summon Cobra from your deck. Activate Cobra's effect to add Fusion Destiny to your hand. Link summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> right after using Cobra and Scorpio. It is important to do this before activating Fusion Destiny since it locks you into dark HEROs for the rest of the turn. Hold off until using Anaconda's effect till the end of your turn.  At this point, after summoning Anaconda, you can use Fusion Destiny to make Dominance. The material you use for Dominance depends on your hand but the best targets to use are <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster"">Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster</a>, and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a>. Malicious is an excellent extender as all HERO players know and Dreadmaster is there for the D - Tactics combo. The reason I choose Drawhand instead of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Disk Commander"">Destiny HERO - Disk Commander</a> as the 3rd is because if your opponent destroys your Dominance right away you can't use it's floating effect to summon the D - Boys back from the grave if you have Disk Commander (and no extra D - HEROS) since he cant be summoned from the grave the turn he is sent there. You need 3 valid targets in your grave to trigger Dominance's floating effect.  If you have <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a> or Destiny Draw with a Destiny HERO in your hand, use Dominance's sorting effect on your deck before using them to try and get what you need on the top. The best targets, if you don't already have them in your hand, are D - Tactics, <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a>, and Honest Neos. Other good cards are Plasma and Faris if you have the material to use them. If you have Mask Change you can either special summon Malicious and use it on him to make <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> or set it to use it on Drawhand on your opponent's turn. If you have Faris you can use their effect to place <a data-name=""Vison HERO Increase"">Vison HERO Increase</a> in the spell/trap zone, tribute Faris, special summon itself to special summon <a data-name=""Vision Hero Vyon"">Vision Hero Vyon</a> from the deck. Use Vyon's effect to send <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> to the grave (if you haven't already this turn) using Shadow Mist's effect to add Plasma, or whatever else you need. you can then special summon Malcious and tribute Malicious, Increase, and Vyon for Plasma.  If you are finished with all your other plays you can then use Anaconda's effect to send a different copy of Fusion Destiny from your deck to the graveyard to special summon <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a>. The materials you want to use now are <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a> and Disk Commander. If you don't have D - Tactics set you can use Dynatag's effect to banish itself to give Dystopia 1000 atk damage, enabling it's quick effect pop effect. You want to target either Drawhand or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a> in your graveyard for it's burn effect on summon to do 1600 effect damage.  Your end board will most likely be Anaconda/Dominance/Dystopia with the possibility of having Plasma or Dark Law on top of that. Pretty much a board of a Drident/Skill Drain/Macro Cosmos + 1 hand rip if they search. During the standby phase use D - Tactics to boost your dude's attack points.  The fun part is when your opponent destroys Dominance or it gets destroyed at the opponent's end phase by Fusion Destiny's effect. If your opponent destroys it before Dystopia dies then you want to summon Dreadmaster, Disk commander, and 1 other Destiny HERO (Normally Malicious if you used Dynatag/Drawhand's effects and banished them already) activating Disk Commander's effect to draw 2. If your opponent does not destroy Dominance or Dystopia dies first, then you want to summon Dystopia instead of the other Destiny HERO and use it's effect to burn your opponent again.  When you summon Dreadmaster (or Dystopia) off of Dominance's floating effect on their turn while D - Tactics is on your field you can banish a card from either their hand (random), field, or graveyard. The cool thing about Dreadmaster is that the turn he is summoned, Destiny HEROs cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect AND you don't take battle damage from them, protecting your cards to set up for the next turn, guaranteeing you at least 3 monsters if your opponent has no other ways to get rid of them. What you can do from then on is summon <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> using Disk Commander and Malicious/Dreadmaster/another hero in your hand as material to bring back Dystopia/Dominance from the graveyard, banishing ANOTHER opponent's card with D - Tactics. If you summon Dystopia again you could burn your opponent again up to 4800 damage over the two of your turns.  The extra deck isn't super strict. 2 Dominance and Dystopia just in case. <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a> and <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> as OTK tech cards. 2 Dark law standard. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> is there as a polymerization play as an extender or a third Fusion Destiny target if you run out of Destiny HEROs in the deck haha (this is actually a serious problem stop laughing). <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> and <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver </a>are standard. 2 Cross Crusader pretty standard. <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> is not necessary at all, just had extra space and its a nice card with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> and Shadow Mist, activating their effects from the grave. Anaconda is really the only necessary expensive card in the deck. You need one copy in order to do the combo. I guess you could do without it and just use the Scorpio and Cobra for Cross-Sheep or material for Plasma (or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dogma"">Destiny HERO - Dogma</a> if you are feeling extra spicy).  The side deck is just additional draw power/<a data-name=""Destiny End Dragoon"">Destiny End Dragoon</a> in case you want to use him instead of one of the other 2 monsters going second.  Overall this is a nice approach to the normally cookie cutter HERO standard strategy that everyone uses (myself included...). It is relatively budget; with the exception of the Vision HERO engine and Anaconda it is less than 50 dollars. Deck is about 135 dollars. Vision HEROS + Anaconda is about 91 dollars. 135 - 91 = 43 dollars. Pretty cheap huh? I was thinking about making a bigger deck since the deck runs out of resources but it hurts the chance of finding D - Tactics.  Thank you for checking out my deck profile. I will probably make a similar/updated version of this deck in the near future."

I’m sticking with my pendulum magician destruction sword deck so strategy is very similar with various end results but we all know getting Dragoon on the field is a must, getting an addition negate with vortex is a must; and locking monster effects and the extra deck with Buster Dragon, Dragon Destroyer and Dragon Buster is a must. I know that seems like a lot but it can be done in one turn consistently with guardragon, skull dread and protector welp and made more likely with Hali. my friend runs a six Sam deck that burns in one turn so I’ve been consistently improving to lock him in one turn."

Only 2 <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a> and <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Booty"">Plunder Patroll Booty</a>: I decided to cut these 2 down because I ended up bricking a lot with them. I would only max out shipshape if I could play Magicians souls but sadly I only have 1 and I don't want to buy more :D  3x <a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>: I saw a lot of people playing 2 but I think this card is really important for the deck and I want to see it as much as possible because I always want to have plunder cards in my hand before I end my turn.  no desires, 1 <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>: I would play desires but I wanted to keep this deck at 40 cards and I feel like all the other cards are very important for my strategy and I think 1 avarice can really help you out if you top deck it. I will probably put it back in my next list but I decided to to this one without desires.  Extra Deck Plunders: I saw a lot of people running 3 of every Plunder Patroll card in their extra deck. I get that you always need them to summon out your monsters on your opponents turn but I don't think you need to max out all of them. In fact I used to run only 1 of each but I decided to play 2 Moerk and Lys because they are the most important Extra deck plunders in my opinion. They both have really good effects and Moerk is also dark which is a pretty popular attribute. The reason why I don't want to play too many plunders in my extra deck because of 2 reasons: 1. The main combo of my strategy takes too much extra deck space and 2. there are plenty of options to recycle your ED monsters from the grave either with Booty, Avarice or <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>  &nbsp;  <strong>Strategy/Main Combo</strong>:  The Strategy of this deck focuses around 1 Main combo with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>: Ideally you have a <a data-name=""whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm"">whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm</a> and another monster to make Halqifibrax. use Halq effect to summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast o-lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast o-lion</a> from your deck. Link halqifibrax into <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> and summon 2 Tokens. Use 1 token and o-lion to synchro summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a>. Chain link 1 Material Metal, Chain link 2 o-lion. Then you can synchro summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc light"">Herald of the Arc light</a> with Marcher and the lvl 1 token. be careful before you summon Herald because any monster you will send from hand or deck to the GY will be banished instead after he is on the field. Then you can synchro summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> with the lvl 3 token from o-lion and whitebeard. Now you can trigger Whitebeards effect to summon out another plunder patroll from your deck. After that you will be locked into plunder patrolls but you can still summon <a data-name=""Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain"">Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain </a>using that plunder patroll monster and linkross as link material.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can use it's effect of negating your opponent's face up card once per turn. Using Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane's effect of tributing 1 monster to special summon 1 ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" monster from the GY is a must-do if you want many synchro monsters on the field.

General plays:  Photon Vanisher + another level 4 monster -&gt; Starleige Photon Blast. you want to use vanishers effect to special summon it and draw a Galaxy-eyes photon dragon, then summon Photon blast to special summon photon dragon. Photon blast also serves as protection for your other monsters and can special summon galaxy-eyes photon dragon from your gy or banished zone, and if you can attach Photon Orbital, Photon blast will protect itself.  Situations:  Opening play on an empty board.  Starleige Photon Blast Dragon: will protect your other monsters from card effects and can special summon galaxy eyes photon dragon.  Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: will be able to negate a monster effect, and serves as a draw engine.  Galaxy-eyes solflare: you can use photon lord to add galaxy-eyes photon dragon and have fuel for solflare to pop a special summon, disrupting your opponent. (look for key targets like tuners, link monsters ect)  Opening turn and the opponent has played  Galaxy-eyes full armor photon dragon will be able to destroy any face up card by using its effect, also the 4000 attack is good enough to deal with most monsters.  Galaxy-Eyes cipher blade dragon will deal with pesky face downs that you don't want to trigger.  Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon dragon, if you just need to negate all monster effects on board. pretty useful and can OTK with a combo that we will get to later.  Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, basically if you need to just negate all effects on the board and you need something that's beefy, 4500 attack base and will indefinitely negate all effects on the board. if you get the option or are just able to, try summoning him first then your other monsters as to keep those effects.  Big damage Combos  Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon (has Galaxy-Eyes photon dragon and Galaxy-eyes afterglow as matierial) + other Xyz monsters. if you have this card and another Xyz monster, and you know its safe to attack, attack with number 62, activate its effect and remove afterglow as material, number 62 will gain attack equal to all the added up ranks of Xyz monsters on your field x200 (if you have 2 lvl 8 Xyz that will equal 8+8=16 x 200 = 3200) and then activate Afterglows effect, and since its activated during the damage step all number monsters have their attack doubled (in the case previously 4000+3200 = 7200 x 2 = 14400.)  Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon + Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon. This is pretty simple, at the start of your damage step, if you know its safe to attack, activate number 107's effect by removing afterglow as its material, you negate all monster effects on board and since its afterglow and you did this during the damage step number 107's attack will be 6000 and it will be able to attack twice."

(Most likely chip damage). Also you depend on your field spell a lot but hopefully you go into time before your opponent can side s/t hate.  Non Ghostricks in the Main Deck:  Mystic Mine: You play 4 copies of metaverse. It can be a free win going first and can stall so you can get resources. It's just nice to have.  Needle Ceiling: It Blows up your opponents board but not yours since it only effect face up monsters  Drowning Mirror Force: Your opponent is going to attack directly most of the time due to the your field spells or you bricked which resulted in a t set pass. Either way it's a good way to remove stuff but it is vulnerable to s/t hate.  For the extra deck Break Sword is there because good rank 3. The links are generic. They're nice to have but if you want to run extrav then I recommend swaping 2 of them for another alucard and a socuteboss.  Other options (All of these can replace Needle Ceiling or Drowning if you want):  The Rock: It's needle ceiling but a handtrap. It only tributes face up monsters meaning most likely your not deleting your stuff.  Battle Fader: It's a better lantern but not searchable and not recoverable.  Pot of Extrav: It's a plus one. If you want to use it then I recommend taking out a skeleton and jiangshi or 2.  Titanocider/Lost Wind: Negates stuff and makes your opponent suffer more. What's not to like?

Initially only 8 Salamangreat monsters were being ran in the main deck (no Fowl), however I found that Salad's lose if they don't see Salamangreat monsters, so an extra extender in the form of Salamangreat Fowl was added. Now the deck has 13 Starter Cards, 14 Extenders (including the field spell) and 13 Handtraps+Traps+Interruptions. This is quite even, allowing for nicer ratios when drawing.  For the extra deck you can side out the Avramax or one of the XYZ monsters for the second Heatleo if you find that you need him. There is a Salamangreat Almiraj as a slightly more generic link 1 that can be used for when Zombie world is up. You can play Traptrix Rafflesia and Gravesdigger's Trap Hole if you want instead of Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to play around Nibiru.

This deck also plays an array of hand traps allowing it to easily play second. To do the combo is you need to have 3 level 4 monsters on the field which is easy, then you overlay 2 for Force Strix and detach a material to search singing Lanius, then you special singing Lanius from your hand then link Force Strix and Singing Lanius to summon Wise Strix, then you special Summon Zephros the elite from your deck then overlay it and the last level 4 for Force Strix, then activate its effects detaching Zephros to search Raiders' Wing, then Wise Strix sets Soul Shave Force from your Deck, then detach 1 material to special Raiders' Wing from your hand, then you activate soul shave special summoning force Strix from your GY to use it as material to summon Beatrice, then you activate Beatrice sending Orcust Knightmare to the GY, then you banish Knightmare to dump World Wand, wand banish to summon Knightmare, link Knightmare and Beatrice to summon Galatea, galatea shuffle wand to set Babel, activate babel then bounce it to summon Zephros then activate babel again, overlay zephros and Raiders' wing to summon evilswarm nightmare, then overlay galatea int Dingirsu, Link for I:P then end you turn.

Really in love with this archetype for not only the beautiful card art, but their versatility as well. Black Rose Dragon also being one of the most iconic of the Signer Dragons.  &nbsp;  Not many long winded combos, but most of the better plays are as follows:  White Rose Cloister to special summon a rose dragon or one of your plant type monsters. If you summon a tuner: you can bring out Dark Rose Fairy as well.  Rose Girl can special summon herself if you have her in hand when using Lonefire Blossom's effect, or when using any of your plant type monsters to perform a Synchro or Link summon.  In addition, White Rose Dragon can special summon itself from hand by having any dragon or plant type tuner on the field.  Twilight Rose Knight's effect of special summoning a level 4 or below plant type monster from hand enables the classic level 7 combo for Black Rose Dragon, or level 6 for Splendid Rose/Queen of Thorns.  More to come on this since it's my first deck I'm posting, but the side deck is there mostly to play around with. Hope this is useful to someone :)"

I've edited the deck so that it uses Yuki-Musume and Yuki-Onna 4, and I made space by trimming Gozuki and some Link plays I didn't really find too useful. I also extended the second round of the Mayakashi ladder, so that it has better reach against abnormal deck counts, as well as giving it more fuel in case it has to fight conventionally. This comes at the cost of some toolbox space, but this deck is pretty committed to its game plan anyway.  Play lines all revolve around finding a way to get Dakki, 2 Level 1 material, and Bone Tower onto the field. Common lines almost always involve Hajun somehow, since he's a one-card trigger for the ladder.

The key is to always be aware of the attributes of the opponent and have fun practicing it.  Kaiju, the kaiju engine is to take care of hard targets and throw new attributes onto your opponents field for you to summon new Plunder Patrol monsters. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Immortal Phoenix Gearfried, this card is very good in this deck. By banishing emblem or a monster that is equipped to another monster you can Special summon it and get an extra negation after the battle phase.</p> Utopia combo, if you have 2 L4 monsters (which happens a lot) you can create a 10,000 attack monster. You start by overlaying them to summon Utopia Double then activate its affect and get Double or Nothing and summon Number 39 Utopia. since it was summoned by utopia double it is at 5,000 attack then proceed to the battle phase attack then activate N39's affect and negate the affect then activate Double or Nothing and it attacks with 10,000 attack. The only downside to this combo is that you are not allowed to attack directly so never use it if the opponent does not have a monster."

If you get this far and farther to Martial Metal Marcher, you are most likely to succeed in achieving the board. This board I speak of consists of Apollousa, Borreload Savage Dragon (equipped with Dragon Buster Destruction Sword and Crystron Halqifibrax which means it gets 2 borrel counters which you can use to negate cards and effects), and Herald of Arc Light or Adamancipator Risen Dragite if you manage to make it that far (it is possible to achieve summoning both level 8 monsters in the first turn.

","Red Resonator is a really important card in this deck, normal summon Red Resonator to special summon a level 4 fiend monster from your hand. (Such as Red Sprinter, Red Familiar, Performage Hat Tricker, etc.) You will then be able to synchro summon Red Rising Dragon from your Extra Deck. By using Red Rising Dragon's effect you'll be able to special summon Red Resonator from the GY and use Red Resonator's special effect of targeting a monster on the field to gain LP equal to the monster's ATK.  You can then synchro summon for Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.  Keep repeating this process and you'll have multiple synchro monsters on the field. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss is a good card to synchro summon for, use something like Synkron Resonator or Chain Resonator to synchro summon it with Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can use it's effect of negating your opponent's face up card once per turn. Using Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane's effect of tributing 1 monster to special summon 1 ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" monster from the GY is a must-do if you want many synchro monsters on the field. Counter field sweeps with Hot Red Dragon Abyss's effect.  Pretty fun deck, not too competitive."

A cool combo I came up with that I think is really good is with the Fire True King, you can use his effect to pop 2 fire monsters in your hand to special summon himself and banish an opponent's monster which is pretty sick. Sending Infernoids as cost from your hand to grave via Agnimazud isn't really a cost because you don't go neg since Infernoids can be special summoned from your graveyard anyway. </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Imagination"">Infernoid Imagination</a><a data-name=""Reasoning""> is also an insane going second card, allowing you to send basically all of your Infernoid monsters from deck to grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">Infernoid Tierra</a><a data-name=""Reasoning""> and send all 3 copies of </a><a data-name=""Reasoning"">Elder Entity N</a>'tss and using their effects to pop 3 cards on the field. You can also pop <a data-name=""Nine-Tailed Fox"">Nine-Tailed Fox</a> using Agnimazud and it will generate 2 tokens. I know its not that consistent because its a two card combo that isn't searchable by any means, but its a cool tech I liked when testing. I've surprisingly beaten a lot of meta decks in testing with this deck. You just have to go second and bait out their negates with your lesser powerful interruption cards and then blow them out with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> or Infernoid Imagination. I hope you guys enjoy and see you next time!"

Your other objective is to get Unicore on field. You can get the Phul on board quite easily since you are running a ton of searchers. I can't stress it enough that getting Phul on the board is your #1 objective. Unicore is just the icing on the cake. But if you open a way to get Unicore + Kaleidoscope + Either Ophiel, Phul or one of the big Megaliths you can use Kaleidoscope to make Unicore, sending Herald of the Arclight, then using Herald Of the Arclight's effect to grab the missing combo piece. After turn one, you pretty much just keep setting up Phul to make Bethor, not allowing your opponent to get a hold on the game and slowly poke away at their lifepoints.  PROS <ul>  	<li>It's Consistent. Like I said, you are running so many searchers that there are almost always multiple ways to get the cards you need.</li>  	<li>A well placed summon of Bethor can just completely shut down a lot of decks.</li>  	<li>It's extremely cheap. All of the Megalith cards are 15 cents or less, and the most expensive cards are Arclight ($3) and Chalislime ($3) and Manju ($4)</li> </ul> CONS <ul>  	<li>It is extremely fragile at the Phul resolution on your opponent's turn. It is easily stopped by an Imperm or ash, and at that point you just have a blue boy on field, and maybe a Unicore.</li>  	<li>Nuking your opponent's board is cool, but there is a reason why Raigeki is not played in every deck today. Most meta decks can play through this, a lot like how they can play through Nibiru.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

A loopable destruction protection for jowgen.,"I found that most people would be countering the one card winda by siding Cyber Dragon Nova and Mechaba, when I realize that Jowgen the spiritualist just says no to all special summons, and that is the point of this deck. With the added protection from Spellbook of Fate and the new Dragma Punishment, it makes jowgen control more better and consistent. All the small dragma monsters are lv4 light spellcaster which is perfect for target for Downbeat to special jowgen straight from the deck!  The spellbook portion is only to engine your card advantage and fuel fate. Deck space is tight so we run only 2 Spellbook Magician of Prophecy as this card is searchable easily by Spellbook of Secrets. Spellbook of Life is an additional extender and can be use to link climb as you can don't have to banish a monster that has a level, but the usual target is either jowgen or magicians' souls. Grand Spellbook Tower was way more useful than I thought as it would help you in the grind game AND if your opponent is going second, 8/10 times, they want to lightning storm your backrow as say you have dragma punishment facedown to protect your cards and forgetting the tower has a graveyard effect to special summon a monster from your deck.  The Dragma portion allows the setup for protection and not usually to use up your normal summon. Adin is convenient that has 1000 atk to link into Almiraj which would back your other Dragma special summons live. Ecclesia in most decks searches Fleur but in this instance we want to to search Dragma punishment to set as a backrow. Fleur is of course a target for magicians' souls and a monster negate when needed. Now the second main reason why this deck came was Dragma Punishment. Dragma punish can send an extra monster to pop a monster on the field with atk less then or equal to the monster sent. There is 3 cards usually you want to send with this: <ol>  	<li>Ashen Dragon, for the end search of Fleur or special ecclesia for another search if you haven't</li>  	<li>N'tss, pop another card on the field</li>  	<li>Omega, to put back dragma punishment into the deck to be searched again</li> </ol> The only other card I see worthy talking about is Dark ruler No More, it gives the deck a go second option to combat those n-negate boards."

Also BLS, Chaos Ruler, and the Draitrons can return fro","Draitron is Impcantation on crack and super compatible with Black Luster Soldier, being lv1 light it means you can have Overtex for Pill using Super Soldier Synthesis to fetch it from deck. Combo depends on what you draw, it means you need practice on how to maximize the Draitron advantage (key point is Synthesis can summon BLS from GY like Draitron ritual and Synthesis needs lv1 light fodder in hand). So, the deck has to be carefully tweaked for its ratio and after countless of testing, I found this ratio are the best (subjective, means you can still tweak it to find the objectively best ratio/combination). Tutorial: <a>https://bit.ly/30sLjuO</a>  Diviner is combo piece searchable from Benten. Cupid Volley is there as it is a lv1 light for Synthesis and another light fairy target for Benten while can mill Draitron/BLS/Overtex/Meteornis. Effect Veiler is lv1 light for Synthesis and can be fetched from Chaos Ruler for extra interruption. Meteornis Draitron can be recurred from GY, summon ritual from GY. Gateway to Chaos for BLS and super easy to have counter for ritual spell searching. Fafnir mostly as extra Nova for Draitron, can search Meteornis too.  Extra deck: N'tss and Arc Light as Diviner target. Michael as lv7 (Diviner + 1 Draitron) removal and mills card like Cupid Volley. Reprodocus as fodder if we draw Tyranno.

I'm expecting a Linkross ban, but with Coronavirus this might be legal for longer. I initially built this combo (or at least the shell of it) for HEROES, on the basis of using Cross-Sheep to res Stratos to search Faris after finding fodder with Isolde. The problem with the combo in that shell was threefold - the deck had no follow-ups, couldn't play through hand traps, and had too many bricks and not enough space. Eldlich seems like a much better fit for the combo, since it solves those problems - it even ends on additional monsters, since I didn't feel as bad about running the Seyfert/Black Dragon/White Dragon engine over REDM. That means either more negates for Apollousa, or a lingering effect in the form of Abyss Dweller. There are some problems - you can mill bricks with Tuning and kill your own combo, for example. And it does still take 8 bricks to do the combo, meaning nearly a 1/4 of the deck are bricks (though soft ones you don't mind in your hand). Also, Dragoon summoned this way can't break boards, significantly reducing its utility. Still, you get 2-4 negates, plus a potential lingering effect from Abyss Dweller, and an Omni-negate on a great beatstick before you start dropping backrow, and if you get interrupted you should still be able to get some Eldlich stuff going most of the time."

""Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince"" allows us to send ""Atlantean Dragoons"", to search for ""Atlantean Dragoons"", thus allowing us to get 2 searches for the price of one, or sending ""Atlantean Heavy Infantry"" to destroy an opponent's card (Infantry targets so be careful what you try to upset).  ""Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord"" is the key to destroying your opponent's hand before they even have a chance to play, Special Summon him when you have 5 WATER monsters in the Graveyard to remove 2 cards from their hand.  ""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"" when Synchro Summoned allows us to draw a card to extend with, and also allows us to XYZ Summon ""True King of all Calamities"", or destroy a card on the field while sending cards such as: &#x2666; ""Mermail Abyssgunde"" to <em>Monster Reborn</em> a ""Mermail"" monster from the Graveyard; &#x2666; or any ""Atlantean"" to combo farther.  ""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" is our 4th hand destruction card, and allowing us to Banish other cards from the Hand, Graveyard and Field (1 each).  ""Bujinki Ahashima"" allows us to setup the ""Bahamut Shark"" ""Toadally Awesome"" giving us another out to ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", or to Negate a card in general.

In almost 16 years but I decided to try updating my October 2004 deck for fun.  This deck includes a lot of old cards from my October 2004 deck as well as some newer cards I think sound interesting.  Before I quit in October 2004, I had plans to put the Horus LV cards in my deck if I decided to keep playing so I put them in this deck.  The deck relies on the Horus cards as a major strategy but it also relies on Waking the Dragon to get powerful monsters out of the extra deck easily.  Of course, Injection Fairy Lily is also a major factor in the deck as she was in my 2004 deck and I’ve included two copies in the main deck and one in the side deck (she was limited in 2004).  I’ve also included Lullaby of Obedience in the side deck to maybe use in the second duel of the match in order to disrupt the opponent’s strategy."

I'd say the deck benefits most from going first, as it gives you a chance to set up negates without having to worry about your opponents board. The main prbolem is hand traps, as they more or less shutdown your opening play outside of <a data-name=""Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core"">Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</a> and <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a>. Depending on your hand you have several options:  <strong>Option 1- </strong><a data-name=""Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato"">Meklord Army Arsenal of Obbligato</a> and <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel"">Meklord Emperor Wisel</a> are needed in your hand. Summon Obbligato and uses it effect to destroy itself and summon two Meklord Army monsters from your deck, this will proc Wisel's effect so you can summon it. Link your two Meklord army monsters into <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>, and uses its effect to equip Wisel with <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a>. Now you've locked your opponent out of their extra deck and have a 3500 attack point monster on the field. If you have any traps in your hand be sure to set them for extra negates or stall and Wisel can also negate one Spell card per turn for another layer of defence. Your Graveyard is also set to be able to summon Triskelia. A downside is that Wisel is the only monster that can attack due to its effect.  <strong>Option 2- </strong>This can be done as long as you start with <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a> in your hand and any Meklord Emperor. Using Meklord Assembly you can search for Nucleus if it's not already in your hand, otherwise searh for any Mekord that you need. Summon Nucleus and use its effect to add Meklord Control to your hand. Use Meklord Assembly's other effect to destroy Nucleus by sending  Meklord Control to the Graveyard to summon one of your Emperors from the deck, this will also proc the effect of whatever Meklord Emperor is in your hand as well. Summon the Emperor from your hand and a different one from your deck using the effect of Nucleus. Wisel is good here as it adds that extra layer of defence with its effect. but <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Granel"">Meklord Emperor Granel</a> could also work giving you a 4000 attack point monster and then using the other Emperor you can link into Linkuriboh as well. Granels attack is based off your LP so it may not be great later into the match or if you use Solemn Judgement next turn. Having Meklord Control in your Graveyard also helps your Meklords survive an effect or attack as well, since you can banish it to negate their destruction.  Of course their a more opening options but these two are the ones I like using the most, and can shut down some opening plays.  Going second is a little bit harder as you'll have a tougher time getting out your Meklords. To help going second <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More </a>and <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> are pretty self explanatory, and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> can help shutdown your opponents combos. Try and get Triskelia out as soon as possible if you can. The easiest way is through the use of Obbligato since it sends itself to the Graveyard and you can Link summon to send the others to the Graveyard.  &nbsp;  While some of the Spells and Traps seem obvious a choice like <a data-name=""Pulse Mines"">Pulse Mines</a> helps keep your Meklords alive and kicking forcing your opponent to have all their monsters in defence position. Link monsters do get round this and can cause a problem but both Solemn traps can help prevent your opponent getting any on the field. I did try <a data-name=""Guard Mines"">Guard Mines</a> as well but found it got very little use as to many effects are mutlitarget.  <a data-name=""Meklord Astro Extermination"">Meklord Astro Extermination</a> is a nice way to summon 3 of your Meklords from your Graveyard ignoring their summoning conditions, which is a nice way to get Triskelia and <a data-name=""Meklord Astro Mekanikle"">Meklord Astro Mekanikle</a> on the field. If your opponent dose have Synchro on the field too, it has the added benefit of being able to get rid of that as well.  <a data-name=""Meklord Control"">Meklord Control</a> can be used to boost one Meklord up to some high attack, and by banishing it from your Graveyard gives your Meklords some defence. Just remember it uses the original attack of Meklords you control, so Emperor Granel will contribute nothing to the total as an example, as its original attack is 0.  &nbsp;  As for the Extra Deck I used what most other Meklord decks use. <a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a> is an alternative way to get a strong monster out on your field, such as <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus"">Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus</a> as it's able to disrupt your opponents board by returning one card to their deck every turn as long as it has 2+ materials.  <a data-name=""Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer"">Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer</a> is another way to get rid of your opponents Spells and Traps will boasting 5000 attack points, its a nice anaswer to Spell and Trap heavy decks.  <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a> is another answer to Spell and Trap decks, and while it does remove yours too, it is an easier answer than Galaxy Destroyer.  &nbsp;  Again this is my first deck I've made and I'm no where near being a good deck builder, but I like Meklords and thought I'd try giving them a go. Again any constructive criticism and advise is welcomed.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The first card you want to use to link summon Code Talker is Micro coder, that will let you draw your draw engine ""Cynet Codec"". If you have cynet codec in your opening hand then you still want to use micro coder to draw you Cynet Storm.  You will get the chance to special summon alot and in a few cases make a couple normal summons a turn.  if youre looking to link circuit this is the order you need to do it in:  code talker in the left extra monster zone, code talker inverted below code talker, use code talker inverted to make Transcode talker, use transcode talkers effect to summon code talker inverted from the gy, use code talker inverted to make Excode talker, summon a code talker inverted to the right of excode, use code talker inverted to make shooting code talker, then summon a code talker in the other extra monster zone, if you have the resources at this point use transcode talker to summon Accesscode talker.  I tried to work in a negate effect in there but the arrows dont line up to pull off the link circuit, so its kinda give and take.  zeroboros is just there as a panic button card for the end game if the other monsters havent done the job yet."

Both are good choices since if you sort your deck with Dominance you can destroy an opponent's monster to draw a card which you know what you'll since you sorted your deck. While with Destiny End Dragoon if it gets destroyed you can just banish a Destiny Hero monster from your graveyard to revive it during the standby phase. When fusing normally your go to Fusion Monster is going to Destiny Hero - Dystopia since you can inflict a good amount of burn damage while have a quickie destruction effect when it has a different attack then it's original. Destiny Hero - Dusktopia is probably the worst out of the fusions but still pretty good in my opinion as it can conduct another fusion summon if you have the materials to do so, and it can protect your monsters with it which is pretty good. The reason I put in 3 copies of D-Fusion is because I felt like it and you can remove 1 copy if you want. Adding some more Masked Hero support in the deck would be pretty beneficial as well."

So off to the combos :  1th combo : For this combo you will need one spell you can discard ,one ""little witchcrafter "" to special summon Verre from the deck thats gonna be the first step ,then you will also need to have the card spell chronicle in the hand ,and a way to put witchcrafter patronus in the gy either with foolish burrial goods ,schmiettas eff or by having it in the hand whyle acctivsting spell chronicle ,after the effect you will discard your whole hand so if you have more plays to do before the eff  off spell chronicle resolves better play them ,then you can banish any 5 spell cards  from your deck (I preffer 5 different withchcrafter spells) ,which you can get bach with patronuses eff durring your opponents turn for the lp gain eff of verre and also the negation eff.  2.nd combo: in this combo ill explain why i have 3 copies of patronus in this deck,so the combo starts this way : if you have gennie and witchcrafter creation use creation to get haine ,with genni special summon verre ,the goal is to have as much copies as of one card in the gy as you can to resolve gennis gy eff which adds you any witchcrafter monster from the deck to your hand and the card which you want to add is arruru then set patronus and end your turn ,the in your opponents turn the contorol starts acctivate the eff of patronus target the banished genni shuffle her in the deck then add witchcrafter unvailing use the eff to ss haine and be sure to have an bigger amount of spells in your hand to resolve both verres and haines eff,altough tje best way to do is combo is if you have lets say schmietta 3 witchcrafter spells and patronus in your hand ,then acc schmietta to ss genni then acc the gy eff of schmiette to send bystreet to the gy which you can acc at your endphase ,and continue with the mentioned combo genni eff.. ,but this time you will have double protection due to bystreet and golem .  Now if you ask me why sorrcer of dm in the side ,I'll answer that with a counter question ,which is the most dominate deck in the current 2020 meta game ,eldcilch right,then there you have your answer ,but its not particullary made for lich ,it was made for all trap decks like traptrix,altergeist etc..,you can also include it in the lockdown to lock the opponent even from using traps , but make sure you're going first when you summon him ,also to summon him use the card double summon which i forgot to include ,its the easiest way i think.  Lockdown?!  Yes there is a witchcrafter lockdown which i think all of you alredy know ,but I'm gonna repat it for those who might not know it: so basically you need secret village of the spell casters ,thats the reson i put terra forming in the side if u dont have it alreday in the hand ,then you will set summon limmit while havin a verre on the field and thats it ,but you have also another way to do the lockdown by discrding magicians restage to the gy to resolve his eff to add magicians left hand to your hand while you have the right hand alredy on the field if you dont have the secret village but i think the secret village option is way better ,you can expand the lockdown with the 2nd combo if you have enough resources in your hand ,the end board should look like this: verre ,secret village,summon limit,haine,magicians left hand ,golem in the hand with also an bigger amount of spells in your hand including and if you also find a way to put the scroll on the field its even better ,and if you can include sorrcer by any chanche ,so what you have is ,spell negate ,monster negate ,  Now for the extra deck :this deck doesn't need it at all ,but if you have matchups like let's say heroes and your opponent has bane on the field you can go into big eye  to steal it and destroy his board ,then selene is there just for the monster reeborn eff ,like i had situations where i needed verre but she was in the gy and i didnt had holiday in my hand so i used her eff to revive verre ,and theres also borrelsword and borreload just for game ,and the usual knghtmare package ,but as said it doesnt relay thst much on the extrawhich is the reason i use 3 copies of extravagance.  Now for the stats :  Attack : 6  Deffense : 7  Consistency : 8  Versatality : 7  Comeback : 9  _____________________  Draw pover : 3\5☆  Control : 4\5☆  Burn : 0\5☆  Otk/Ftk : / 2,5\5☆  Stamina :4\5☆  Comeback : 4\5☆  Swarm : 2\5 ☆  ____________________  10 minutes testing :  Win ratio 68%  Dead hand 2  Otk /Ftk 4  __________________  Deck difficulty 2\5☆  Deck tipe : Control  Going first 3,5\5☆  Going second 2,5\5☆  Tier : ???  My personal end note to the deck is 7, 6  And my personal oppinion on this deck is very positive,its a fun control deck with a fun lock ,not hard to play ,it doesnt need much brain cells to figure out how do the work ,have fun with the deck while testing it ."

The main point of this deck is to play off how the older toon monsters are worded, where they don't actually need Toon World/Kingdom on the field to attack directly (in this case, Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon and Toon Dark Magician Girl). You have the basic searchers, Bookmark and Tables, because if this deck is going to do anything, you will need all the searching you can get. Rollback, because why not, it's pretty much the only Toon spell you have access to without Toon World. Also Briefcase, which only requires a toon monster, for some reason.  So, even though you don't need Toon World to attack directly, you do need it for the summon right? Wrong! Because Red-Eyes Toon Dragon and Toon Dark Magician both ignore summoning conditions, so you need those as quickly as possible, hence Black Stone and Insight. Levianeer and BLS, because I needed to fill space, same with Chaos Space.  Does this deck work? Theoretically, yes, but since you have basically a clunky mess with no Extra Deck (you can do whatever you want with that, it's not like you'll ever get to it), and since you don't have Toon World, you don't have Comic Hand, Page Turn, Mimicat, or any other good toon support, you will probably lose by turn 4.  So why did I make this deck? Because I like finding weird loopholes in old cards. So if you play this deck good luck, you will need it."

If you start with Vyon, the main way into Isolde is send Shadow Mist, search Liquid Soldier, banish Shadow Mist, search Poly, Poly for Sunrise, draw 2 discard 1, search Miracle Fusion, summon Ab Zero, link into Isolde - full combo. This means you wipe boards at the start of your combo, which can be a pretty cool way to start a turn. These are also monsters you extend sometimes."

Featuring girsu for amazing first tur","Generaiders are back with Loptr and Girsu! Running the optimal ratio of hand traps for going second and consistency along with a toolbox for every situation, get ready for a blast! Your best starter is Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight! Summon him and send World Armor to grave then activate his effect to create tokens to both sides of field and special summon Linkuriboh using token. Now go into Lib the World Key Blademaster and set World Legacy Succession from the deck. Alternatively if you were unable to send World Armor to grave because he is in hand, go into Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star and discard World Armor adding Succession to hand. Activate succession reviving World Armor using it's effect to add World Legacy Burgeoning to hand. Make Linkross using whichever link monster you made and if you were able to make Lib use her effect to shuffle away your opponents token and create 2 additional tokens, tributing 1 of them for Linkuriboh's effect. After this use 3 monsters to special summon Trishula of Icy Imprisonment and finally target him with your Burgeoning special summoning both Mardel and Harr from deck allowing you to search any generaider card. If you have a generaider monster in hand add Boss Quest, otherwise do the minimum to make sure you have the field spell or if you have the field spell one of the generaider traps. Activate your field spell and make Jormungandr without using Harr activating his effect and making you and your opponent draw. This will trigger Harr's effect forcing your opponent to send a monster to the graveyard AND trigger your field spell allowing you to summon an additional generaider. Summon whichever level 9 gene raider you think is least useful and finally overlay for True King of all Calamities. Enjoy! I will add more combos later as it's late and I really need to get to bed, I hope you enjoy the deck &lt;3"

Durring the years it has been toping ycs,lcs and all kind of events ,some years back it was even considered as undefeatable.those were times the nekroz,pepe,striker,true draco,pendulum magicians era,but now nekroz came back and hes given to less atention ,lets show them that rituals are not dead and what a deck like nekroz can truly do.  So what does the deck does is:  it has its own lock called the ""unicore lock"" where most extra deck based decks scoop ,becouse it prevents the opponent from using the effects of extra deck monsters ,altough you may think unicore is just 2100 atk and is easy to run over, there is nekroz of valkyrus for protection which says "" when an opponents monster declares an attack,you can banish one ""nekroz"" card from your gy and discard this card ,negate the attack and end the battle phase,and the thing about this card is that you can easly get it in your hand in almost every turn.  Enough about the deck now off to the 2020 combo.  Combo : this is bassically a one card combo ,then if you have lets say preparation of rities its better to acctivate it first to bait out the combo becouse that one card needs to go through and the card is deskbot 003 ,normal summon it then acc its first eff which lets you summon any deskbot monster from the deck and the one you want to summon is deskbot 001 ,then link them away into crystron halqifibrax acc his eff to special summon a tuner from the deck and the one you want to summon is 001 ,now link those 2 into auroradon activate his eff to ssmn 3 tokens ,the the gy eff from bot the 001 - s will activate which lets you summon it self from the gy if you special summon 2 or more machine monsters ,now use one token and one 001 to make herald ,now do it again ,now using the heralds xyz summon gallant granite to get nibiru to your hand.  Now since you dettached one herald to acc galants eff use heralds gy eff to add nekroz of brioniac to your hand , now use auroradons eff to sent 2 monsters from the field to the gy to special summon one phantom beast monster in which case you'll take coltwing acc his eff to ss 2 tokens which will trriger the 001 in the gy ,special summon them ,also acc the seconds heralds gy eff to searc for ben ten ,now using the token and one 001 make another herald ,using the left token and 001 make the crystron quandax now link the 2 synchros away for dugares the timelles acc his second eff whic will let you special summon one monster from the gy ,and the one you want to ss is herald ,since herald was sent to the gy use his eff to add unicore ,now use coltwing and herald for daigusto emeral ,acc his eff detach herald to shuffle back one herald ,halqfibrax and one 001 ,then you will draw one card of daigusto ,since herald was send to the gy trigger his eff to search for nekroz kalaidoscope ,now acc kalaidoscope and target the herald you just shuffeled back to ss unicore ,acc heralds eff for the final and last time to search for nekroz of valkyrus , now acc brios eff to add clausolas after that use his eff to add cycle,acc cycle to special summon brio from the gy by sending benten to the gy ,acc bentens gy eff to add archlord kristya and since you got at least 3 fairy cards in your gy ss archlord kristya ,acc his eff to add benten from your gy to your hand ,lets say u started your combo with one card and you added 4 ,how many cards do you have in your hand rn 8 ?!?!  Thats it for the combo ,but if you dont get deskbot 003 in your opening hand (which can happen) or your opponent negates the eff ,just do a normal nekroz play to have unicore on the field ,valkyrus in the hand and if you can secret village and it should go through somehow ,or if you can even expand it ,its up to you . <ul>  	<li>Have fun testing this deck and show them that nekroz is back ,let them fear it one more time .</li> </ul>"

The two heavy hitters are Boot-Up Admiral and Machina Citadel. Boot-Up is the easier of the two to bring out, as the Gadgets can easily be brought out by each other, and even from the graveyard thanks to cards like Pinpoint Guard. Citadel, meanwhile, is best brought out using Air Raider's effect. Machina Fortress is there as a reliable 2500 beatstick that is ridiculously easy to summon, and if it gets taken out, there's always Megaform to fall back on. The Gadgets exist mainly to either provide discard fodder or to be used as Xyz Material themselves. Fortress and Citadel can be brought out from the graveyard so cards like Twin Twisters and Fortress itself can discard them easily. Most of the Xyz Monsters are Rank 4, but there are a couple of Rank 8, as well as 1 Rank 7 (brought out by Fortress) and a couple Rank 5 (which is where Jumbo Drill comes in).  This is not a strictly meta deck, but I did not have the budget to get a bunch of Infinitrack cards."

The secondary pieces or extenders are Arma Gram (follow up play), Mystletainn (behaves like Dux but slightly worse), Legatus (our second Dux, play 2 cus we dont wanna draw multiple as it can be sarched by Gae Dearg if we draw Baby Roc), Phalanx (combo pieces for Savage/King Calamity), Baby Roc (combo pieces as Gae Dearg target, we need 2 and it equals to Legatus if we hard draw it), Glow (great spell but bad starter, only as combo pieces), Divine Lance (hopt like Glow, but is a great starter, we dont wanna draw double both this and Glow, so just run 1 copy of both), Monster Reborn (revives our boss monster), and lastly World Legacy Guardragon (fixing Pisty zone).  The rest of it is just staple or as Crossout target while being great handtrap.

This allows you to link up, use the effect again, and so on to generate the link 6 arrival ignister from only 2 cards!  Additionally, the other cards will allow for strategies such as using Cyberse Quantum Dragon, Cyberse Magician and Crusadia Avramax to create a field that cannot be targeted with card effects or battle due to the looping restrictions. This means that your opponent has to use kaiju effects or non-targeting removal to tackle the board you create!  Heres the bread and butter combo to create Arrival Ignister and Quantum Dragon opening up with Pikari and Achichi. From step 17 onwards you have a lot of options available depending on the opponents board, or what additional cards you have in hand to generate more resources on the field:  1: NS Pikari to search for Ignister A.I Land (If already in hand, search for A.I Reborn to extend)  2: Link Summon into Lingruiboh  3: Activate Ignister A.I Land  4:Activate Lands effect to SS Achichi  5: Active Achichis effect to search for Doyon  6: Link up into Cyberse Wicckid  7: Lands effect to SS Doyon at one of Wicckids arrows  8: Doyons effect to add Pikari to hand from GY  8: Banish Achichi to add Bururu to hand via Wicckids effect  9: Link up into Transcode Talker  10: Lands effect to SS Pikari anywhere but below Talkers down arrow (Because he was NS only this turn, and lands effect only restricts SS from land!)  11: Transcode Talkers Effect to SS Wicckid  13: Link all 3 into Dark Templar  14: Lands effect to SS Bururu to one of Templars Arrows  15: Templars effect to SS Doyon and Pikari  16: Synchro Summon Quantum Dragon using Bururu and Doyon  17: SS Doyon via Bururus effect  18: Link Summon Splash Mage with Doyon and Pikari  19: SS Pikari via Splash Mage  20: Link Pikari, Splash Mage and Dark Templar into your Link 6, 3k boss monster!"

Pepe could easly defeat lieraly every other deck by going first , it was so strong in his format that they called an emergency banlist where they banned 7 cards from the deck ,and they stayed banned till now .  I'll just say one thing about pendulums Mjaespecter Unicorn - Kirin. The fact that its effect wasnt ""once per turn"" back at the days made him so strong ,that konami just felt the need to bann him. Even tho he is not part of the deck I put him in the side just for the case.  What else do I have to say about this deck , then thats it in my oppinion the best deck ever ."

I decided to throw the Cyber Dragon engine in because it gives you a good negate and Infinity allows you to suck up a lot of problem monsters. Here's some notes. <ul>  	<li>Scrap Recycler  are used to send either Jet Synchron, Wonder Wand, any Orcust monster that isn't Girsu, or Cyber Dragon Herz &amp; Core to the grave to start plays. It plays a lot more of a role than I would have thought.</li>  	<li>Girsu the Orcust Mekk-Knight is a good foolish burial for any Orcust monster and a free token if you don't control any other monsters. (which you can go into a Linkuriboh and get a Galatea off of just that!)</li>  	<li>This deck is very graveyard focused so you have to watch out for Called By The Grave. But it gives you plenty of options to bounce back!</li>  	<li>Your turn one board should be either a Galatea with Crescendo, a Dingirsu, Apollousa &amp; Infinity, or Savage Dragon. Or a combination of any of them! You have a lot of options but should keep in mind that once you start banishing Orcusts from the graveyard, you're locked into DARK monster special summoning for the rest of the turn. So get that Infinity or Apollousa out while you can. Oh yeah, and AccessCode Talker is here because we need a big beatstick and he happens to be the best suited I feel with his card destruction effect which isn't once per turn. Was Topological Zeroboros, but he's really unneeded unless you're using Gizmek Orochi for more power. (Also watch out for Nachster, because it locks you into only MACHINE types as well.)</li> </ul> I will be honest this deck can get a little brick heavy if you're going first because of the higher level monsters, but 9/10 I've found myself with at least one decent play to make in order to keep myself alive.

The gun dragons (Dra-<em>gun</em>, if you will). These guys are pretty relevant to the meta game, and are surprisingly easy to pick up!</span>  <span>Basically, your normal strategy is going to involve targeting your Rokket monsters with various Link monster effects (namely <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Booster Dragon"">Booster Dragon</a>, and the family of Borrels), activate the Rokket monster's effect, then at the end of the turn, special summon a different Rokket from the deck!</span>  <span>These guys' biggest strengths include their ability to swarm the field and their quick effects, allowing various forms of destruction and removal (My personal favorite being <a data-name=""Shelrokket Dragon"">Shelrokket Dragon</a>). Another strength being their swole Link-4 Borrel dads and their crazy Topologic uncles. Want mass removal? Topologics. Want interruptions and the best way to trigger a Rokket? Borrels.</span>  <span>Now for the interesting part. Namely, how their greatest strength is their greatest weakness: Graveyard effects. These guys can get really hurt if your opponent activates Called by the Grave or Silent Graveyard, so plan accordingly. Borreload Savage Dragon can ease that problem, so plan ahead with this sweet deck.</span>  <span>Remember to have fun!</span>"

Because of how easy she is to summon, and the floating effects of the Main Deck monsters, Meow-Meow gives Prank-Kids a much-needed improvement!  This deck is meant to go first, but thanks to it having a total of 8 hand traps, and 9 cards in the Side Deck, going second won't do much to hinder you.  As for the reason for this deck's bizarre name, allow me to explain. Lately, I've been binge-watching Boku No Hero Academia, or ""My Hero Academia"", if you prefer. One of the Heroes is Miss Joke, and her Quirk(superpower), Outburst, causes her victims to laugh uncontrollably, making it much easier for her to defeat them. Given the whole theme of Prank-Kids, it seemed kind of appropriate.  &nbsp;  So whether you love Prank-Kids, trolling your opponent with control decks, or going beyond plus ultra, this is the deck for you!"

The combo:  -Summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> (With one of the starters listed in the next section), and use its effect to summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a> from the Deck.  -Summon <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> using Halqifibrax as material, and use its effect to get 2 Link Tokens.  -Summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a> using O-Lion and 1 of the Link Tokens. Use O-Lion's effect to get a Mecha Phantom Beast token, and use Marcher's effect to summon O-Lion back from the GY.  -Summon Accel Synchron using O-Lion and the Mecha Phantom Beast Token. Use its effect to send <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> to the GY and decrease its level by 1.  -Summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> using Marcher and the remaining Link Token.  -Summon Primathmech Alembertian using Herald and Accel Synchron (which is level 4 by its effect).

Use its effect to detach either Mathmech and add <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> to your hand.  -Discard 1 card (not Advanced Ritual Art or Block Dragon) to Summon Jet Synchron from the GY.  -Summon <a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a> using Gallant Granite and Jet Synchron.  -Banish Primathmech Alembertian, Mathmech Division, and Gallant Granite to summon Block Dragon to the zone Reprodocus points to.  -Use Reprodocus' effect to make Block Dragon a Winged Beast.  -Summon Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty using Reprodocus and Block Dragon. Use Block Dragon's effect to add <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> and <a data-name=""The Rock Spirit"">The Rock Spirit</a> to your hand.  -Banish Block Dragon to summon Gigantes, and banish Reprodocus to summon The Rock Spirit.  -Summon <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> using Gigantes and The Rock Spirit.  -Detach both materials from Dugares to summon Herald of the Arc Light from the GY.  -Summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> using Dugares and Herald. Use Herald's effect to add <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> to your hand.  -Use Advanced Ritual Art to send Guardragon Justicia to the GY to summon Devotee. Use Devotee's effect to summon <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> from your Deck.  -Summon Union Carrier using Devotee and Disciple of Nephthys. Use its effect to equip <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> to Simorgh.  -End your turn, and use Simorgh's effect to summon <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> from your deck.  -During your opponent's turn, summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> using I:P Masquerena and Union Carrier (with I:P Masquerena's effect).  At this point, you should be able to negate as many of your opponent's effects as you want (with Apex Avian's effect), while Avramax's effect makes sure your opponent does not attack Thunderbird after it has benn Summoned.  Deck breakdown:  Main Deck:  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> x3, <a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a> x3, <a data-name=""Righty Driver"">Righty Driver</a> x3, <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> x3, <a data-name=""Draconnet"">Draconnet</a> x3: These are the starters used to summon Halqifibrax.  <a data-name=""Crusadia Arboria"">Crusadia Arboria</a> x1, Lefty Driver x1, <a data-name=""Guardragon Justicia"">Guardragon Justicia</a> x3: These cards are summoned with the effects of the starters. Justicia is also needed in the deck for Advanced Ritual Art.  <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a> x1, <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> x1, <a data-name=""Mathmech Division"">Mathmech Division</a> x2, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> x1, <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a>/<a data-name=""The Rock Spirit"">The Rock Spirit</a> x2, <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> x1, <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> x1, <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a> x2, <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> x2: These cards are needed for the combo (see above). All non-Mist Valley cards that have 2 included cannot be used unless they are in the Deck. Gigantes and The Rock Spirit are completely interchangeable, this deck list uses 1 of each but 2 of 1 of them is fine. I have 2 of each Mist Valley monster because it is nice to be able to summon a second Apex Avian at the end of the opponent's turn, and despite the numerous negation effects Mist Valley Thunderbird can sometimes be removed by quick-play spells like <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>.  <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> x3, <a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a> x3, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> x3: These cards are used to protect the combo, Called by the Grave is mostly used to stop <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and Prohibition is able to prevent Ash Blossom (or <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a>, if you also have Called by the Grave). Dark Ruler No More is a great card for removing any monster-based threats when forced to go second, and it can be discarded for Jet Synchron if you draw it going first. I plan to add <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> and cards to banish with it once it releases, but for now it is not included because this is a TCG deck.  Extra Deck:  <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> x1: This card is used with Sangan to eventually summon Crystron Halqifibrax.  Crystron Halqifibrax x2, Linkross x1, Martial Metal Marcher x1, Accel Synchron x1, Herald of the Arc Light x1, Primathmech Alembertian x1, Gallant Granite x1, Reprodocus x1, Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty x1, Number 60: Dugares the Timeless x1, I:P Masquerena x1, Union Carrier x1: These cards are all part of the combo. Halqifibrax is at 2 in case you run into an Ash Blossom with nothing to counter it.  Side Deck:  <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> x3, <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> x3, <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> x3, <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> x3, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> x2, <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> x1: These cards are all used to stop combo decks that get to go first games 2 or 3, except Red Reboot which is a counter to Impermanence or whatever other traps my opponent may have. The side deck cards are subject to change based on what seems to frequently threaten the combo."

With","the main hand in the deck you'll be looking at is a way to get Aleister and 3 Cyberse monsters or ways to get to three and a hand trap. With this, going first you'll do the Invoked combo first to normally get out Mechaba but put it in the main monster zones. Next, you'll get your Cyberse monsters on the field, link into Link devotee and Link disiple then do mathmech plays from there but you'll also link into Code talker inverted to special the Nabla from your hand. All in all, it is a fantastic deck that easily goes first or second and can play through normally 2 negates. and has a good hand trap line up.  If you're going second you can get out mechaba to play through negates and then do Mathmech OTK to win. Thanks for reading, bye."

Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend can destroy all other Special Summoned monsters on the field, and deal 500 damage to your opponent for each destroyed monster. Obviously Beelze is immune to this, so you get another 3K attacker to follow up on the nuke.  Borreload Furious Dragon can target 1 monster your control and 1 card the opponent controls to destroy them. If you target Beelze with this, it'll still pop your opponent's card, so you get free quick-effect removal every turn.

If you are taking this deck to locals, the main deck as shown below is probably fine. You should really try to fit in <strong>Dark Ruler No More </strong>or other cards that just stop your opponent's board going second.  You really want cards in your hand rather than field presence in this deck since a lot of this archetype's cards restrict you to only Fusions or make you just not be able to Special Summon for the rest of the turn like what <strong>Neos Fusion</strong> does. That is why we are playing no Link/Xyz monsters and some heavy draw power. For the draw power, <strong>Three Tactical Talents</strong> is actually good, but the situation will rarely be there where this is active since if you are bringing <strong>Neos-Spacians </strong>to locals or a tournament, you are expecting that they are also playing decks that are just as bad. <strong>Generation Next</strong> is in the side deck since you aren't always going to have it live despite how good it is. You could play <strong>A Hero Lives</strong> to shotgun <strong>Prisma </strong>off the top and have <strong>Generation Next </strong>live, but it is a limited card resulting in it not being always there in your starting hand. You do have <strong>Performapal Popperup</strong> to get <strong>Generation Next</strong> live, but you kind of want to set the other spells/traps that you need face-down before activating <strong>Popperup</strong> so that you aren't burn't for like 5k due to its effect and <strong>Generation Next</strong> is a Quick-play Spell (For some apparent reason) so you can't activate it the turn you set it.  There is literally no starting combo you can do with this deck since such a thing doesn't exist. But if you do get a Fusion on the field, you can equip it with <strong>Favorite Hero</strong> to get a monster with like almost 8k ATK if its a triple fusion, <strong>Flare Neos</strong>, or <strong>Air Neos</strong> since those bois have a grand amount of ATK. Also, at the start of the BP, if you don't have a Field Spell for <strong>Favorite Hero</strong>'s ATK boost, the card lest you activate any field spell from the deck like <strong>Neo Space</strong> for more ATK and no shuffle away eff or <strong>Mystic Mine</strong> since this deck sucks.  Extra Deck has the triple fusions since they are decent and their shuffle effects can be devastating to your opponent (and yourself too????) but they are very hard to get on the field. <strong>Brave Neos </strong>searches almost every spell/trap in your deck. <strong>Air Neos </strong>gains ATK equal to the difference in LP you will have from the <strong>Performapal Popperup </strong>burn. <strong>Grand Neos</strong> is just trying his best here and <strong>Flare Neos </strong>is a possible big beefy boi. No Links because of the stupid fusion restrictions on most of the spells/traps in the main deck."

Your general play is to get <strong>Raviel, Hamon, </strong>and<strong> Uria </strong>in your hand, onto the field, or in the graveyard so that you can fuse into the <strong>Armityle</strong> retrain using <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction</strong>. Cards like <strong>Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos Summoning Beast, </strong>and<strong> Dark Summoning Beast</strong> help get the Sacred Beasts into your hand or onto the field with the help of <strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates </strong>of course. If you plan to activate <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction </strong>and plan to fuse a Sacred Beast that you currently control away, you can Link it off into <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> since you can fuse by banishing from the grave too.  <strong>Soldier of Chaos </strong>gets it effect to be untargetable and indestructibility from card effects since you used a level 7 or higher monster and it can be an out to <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> in the battle phase since <strong>Raviel, Hamon, Uria,</strong> and og<strong> Armityle</strong> still lose out to its ability to gain attack of the monster it's battling if it has a level. <strong>Soldier of Chaos  </strong>can gain 1500 ATK if it destroys a monster by battle so you can use it to attack into Crystal Wing and it wont be able to gain ATK since <strong>BLS</strong> is a link monster.  <strong>Exodius, the Ultimate Forbidden Lord</strong> is material for a Rank 10 monster and is also a target for <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong>. <strong>Capshell </strong>a free draw and a target for <strong>Spirit Gates </strong>and<strong> Dark Beckoning Beast</strong>'s extra normal summon. <strong>Relinquished Amina</strong> allows you to equip one of your opponent's monsters to it. This allows you to free up one of your opponent's zones to give them the <strong>Armityle</strong> retrain. <strong>Verte Andaconda</strong> is for your fusion spell. <strong>Pentestag</strong> is for your monsters doing piercing. <strong>Gustav Max </strong>and<strong> Liebe</strong> for more damage and field presence. <strong>Mannequin Cat </strong>and<strong> Crumble Logos</strong> are there for you get <b>Infinite Impermanenced. </b>  <strong>Reasoning </strong>and<strong> Foolish Burial</strong> for grave set-up. <strong>Evil Mind </strong>is a free draw or a search for <strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction</strong> if you go against something like <strong>Adamancipator</strong>(?).

I actually got the idea to make it months ago, but I've been too lazy to post a deck profile. Anyways, this deck is named after Gold Experience Requiem, the most powerful Stand in JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Vento Auero. So, between this and Golden Wind(<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-wind/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-wind/</a>), that's TWO Eldlich decks inspired by JoJo.  &nbsp;  Anyways, you'd prefer to go first with this deck, but 9 hand traps and some go-second cards in the Side Deck mean that it can still pack a whallop if you don't, especially given the battle-related effects of the Rank 1 ""Numeron Gate"" monsters. Nonetheless, you'd prefer to go first and try to summon Utopic ZEXAL so your opponent will never arrive at the truth.  &nbsp;  And before you ask...YES, that WAS a JoJo reference!"
