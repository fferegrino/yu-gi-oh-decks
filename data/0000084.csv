Go first and setup your negates so you can kill your opponent in the next turn.,"This is an Orcust deck with a scrap and a Danger! engine. The scrap cards will start the combo off and the Dangers to improve consistency. sometimes you need to take slight detours to start the combo off but with enough skill (and memory), you will always pull it off.  My rating:  Attack: 4/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 5/5  Strong against: Shaddoll, Blue Eyes  Weak against: Gravekeeper, Nekroz  Main Scrap Combo:  Normal summon Scrap Recycler  Activate and send O-Lion/Jet Synchron to the grave (You need to send a card to the GY for Jet to revive it)  Summon a token with O-Lion's effect, or use Jet to SS itself  Link them into Wyvern  Activate Wyvern's effect, summon Recycler and send it back to the GY, then SS Golem from the deck, then destroy a card on the field. (Note: if you are going first you will need a card on the field to send to the GY, like a spell or a Danger)  Activate Golem's effect, SS Recycler  Activate Recycler, send World Wand to the GY  Link Golem and Recycler into Ib  Activate Ib and set World Legacy Succession  Activate Succession, summon Golem from the GY  Activate Golem again to summon Recycler, the send Knightmare to the GY  Link Ib and Wyvern into Apollousa (Don't use the other cards!)  Activate Knightmare from the GY, buff up any card (it really doesn't matter) and send Cymbal Skeleton to the GY  Activate Wand to SS Knightmare  Link one of the Scraps with Knightmare to make Galatea, then shuffle Wand from the banished zone into the deck, setting Orcustrated Babel  Activate Babel  Activate Cymbal Skeleton, SS Knightmare  Link the other Scrap with Knightmare to make Verte Anaconda  SS Dingirsu using Galatea, attach Cymbal Skeleton to it  Activate Anaconda, send Instant Fusion to the GY and SS Winda  End your turn. Winda will stay alive if you detach a material from Dingirsu (Preferably Cymbal Skeleton), so it will stay alive in your opponent's turn. Don't keep her for 2 turns because she will just lock you out of special summoning too!  &nbsp;  Overall, this deck is pretty high skill because you need to time your negates and create big combos. Have fun!"

They can go first or second - just make sure not to use Ride of the Valkyries if you go first.  &nbsp;  They aren't super reliant on the Extra Deck, meaning Pot of Extravagance is actually a great draw power card for them. They can afford to play 1 of everything (except the obvious 3-of) because losing any particular one still allows for their typical lines of play.  Being a Fairy-type based archetype means they potentially have the ability to lock special summons with Archlord Kristya.  Their new ""boss"" monster, Valkyrie Sigrun, has the ability to special summon any other Valkyrie monster from the hand or GY making it an excellent combo extender/starter, and is also, for some reason, a level 9 which means boards can end with True King of all Calamities.  &nbsp;  They also have 3 incredibly strong spells; Final Light, the aforementioned Ride of the Valkyries, and Mischief of the Time Goddess.  Final Light is essentially an archetype specific Soul Charge.  Ride of the Valkyries allows you to special summon as many Valkyries with different names as you want from your hand at the cost of bouncing your entire board back to the decks during the EP. Once it's in the GY you can activate its second effect to search a Mischief of the Time Goddess from your deck.  Finally, Mischief of the Time Goddess is a quick-play spell that you can activate at the end of your BP as long as you only control Valkyrie monsters. It skips the turn clock ahead to the start of your next BP allowing you to skip your previous MP2, EP, your opponent's entire turn, and your current DP, SP, and MP1 as though they never happened. This allows for some interesting things. 1, it means you can avoid the negative effects of cards such as Ride of the Valkyries and Celestial Transformation. 2, it also means you can essentially OTK your opponent regardless of the Valkyries low attack power weakness. 3, ""hard once per turn"" effects can potentially be activated again during the MP2 after your second BP.  &nbsp;  All in all, it is a rogue archetype that I truly feel hasn't been explored enough.  &nbsp;  I'm mostly uploading this to see how much the deck would cost. I have had success with it on EDOPro and am considering purchasing it irl now that Valkyrie Sigrun has been released in the TCG."

The list has a lot of similarities to Shunping’s but I’ve also made changes to make it cheaper (I don’t own Seyfert) while maintaining a similar level of consistency and resilience. I also think this variant is easier to play personally. That said it is still a very challenging deck to play overall. The deck can pump out strong first turn boards but also has a fair bit of flexibility to play through challenging situations going second.  <em>Edit: note I have made a few additions to sections that I have included as italicized ""Edit:"" comments after the original section. I have not changed any original text or the deck itself.</em>  <strong>2 card choices</strong>  I’m not going to address every card in the deck but will address a few odd picks in the deck.  <u>Black Metal Dragon:</u> This card saw usage as a 1 of in Shunpings list. I’ve been using it as a 3 of because it makes a 1 card combo into a full board. It might not be as good of a 1 card combo as seyfert but at a fraction of the price I think it is well worth it.  <u>Keeper of the Shrine:</u> There are some specific combo purposes for this card such as with Black Metal Dragon but it is also in large part in the deck as a backup target for dragon shrine and foolish burial if you drew background dragon and Absorouter and/or have already sent them to the graveyard.  <u>Background Dragon:</u> This card is bricky if you draw it but makes dragon shrine and foolish burial into amazing starters. You can complete a whole combo without committing a normal summon assuming no disruption using this card.  <u>Autorokket Dragon:</u> So Cosmic Cyclone is a natural out to cards like Mystic Mine but doesn’t work against things like Secret Village of The Spellcasters or Imperial Order. This card gives the deck a natural out to spell and trap cards which block the deck from playing spells. Alternatively, you could substitute Knightmare Phoenix but the deck’s extra deck is very tight and also: Tracer, Elpy, Pisty, Rokket Synchron, and Quadborrel are all liabilities for locking the deck out of playing the Phoenix.  <u>Hibernation Dragon:</u> This card struggles to fit into the deck but at the same time has crazy effects in my opinion. It is a +1 for just summoning it while you have a level 4 or lower dragon in your GY. It can also summon Borreload/Borrelsword Dragon from the GY by banishing itself. Most of the combos don’t have room to summon search it though. I usually find this card makes a good backup Hieratic target if you don’t want to summon Brotaur because you already like your hand as is or Drew Brotaur. If you don’t like this card feel free to replace it with another Absorouter Dragon or whatever you want.  <strong>3 Combos</strong>  Here are some Youtube videos of different combos you’ll be looking for in this deck and how to perform them (Each video is about a minute long). Notably these combos are all done with minimum resources and can end on stronger boards with more resources invested. I also demonstrated some different boards you could choose to end on when using Romulus while Dark Locked.  <em>Edit: I've created a playlist with all the combos in it here: <a>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4wvY6W8_poYB0amunwwgUjIXYmFBELs-</a></em>  1 card combo with Black Metal Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPMmi7bVSt0</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Dragon Shrine  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U__fPt-FiVI</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Absorouter Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuGkXOpp7fY</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Quick Launch  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdo4q2Z9O5I</a>  Dubious Hand. Sometimes you get a hand that has no clear combo but can still make an awesome board.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCT_rcTkUJY</a>  <strong>4 Budget Options</strong>  While I’ve tried to keep this deck cheaper for my own wallet’s sake, some cards have gone up in price since I bought them. Below is a list of cards you can cut and potential substitutions for them:  1x <u>Striker dragon</u> -&gt; whatever you want. The third is a luxury for turn 3 if you use 2 turn 1 but most combos only use 1. <em>Edit: I've considered Barricadeborg Blocker before for the deck but there is no room to include it. may be a good substitute for a third striker dragon due to the decks tendency to shoot Boot Sector for Combos.</em>  3x <u>Dark Ruler No more</u> -&gt; Effect Veiler is a good budget handtrap  3x <u>Called by the Grave</u> -&gt; D.D. Crow. Doesn’t protect your combos but is a really strong affordable hand trap right now.  1x <u>Borreload Savage Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi is much weaker but still provides a strong level 8 synchro disruption to end on.  1x <u>Borrelsword Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi also is kind of a much weaker Borrelsword. If you aren’t looking at running two Draco Berserkers because really there is no reason to, you can throw whatever other dark boss monster you want in this slot. Borreload Excharge Dragon and Borrelguard Dragon are both really cheap alternatives that fit in easily. <em>Edit: Topologic cards also may make good replacements and are widely considered better than Borrelguard and Excharge Dragon. </em>  <em>Edit: Other budget options for the extra deck with their own pros and cons each include: an additional Borreload Dragon, Galaxy Satellite Dragon, Saryuja, Wee Witch's Apprentice, and Booster Dragon.</em>  <strong>5 Seyfert Upgrades</strong>  If you own Seyfert or have no qualms spending the money for him and the Black and White Dragons to go with him. You can cut: 1 Silverrokket, 1 Magnarokket, 2 Black Metal Dragons, and Hibernation Dragon to make room for that 5 card package. <em>Edit: Since the Black Metal dragons are being used as 1 card combos, removing a Cosmic Cyclone and a Dark Ruler No More over the Black Metal Dragons may be better a better choice.</em>  <strong>6 Side Deck</strong>  There are so many options for the side deck at the moment at so many different price points I felt that I didn’t want to hold the deck back or make it really expensive by trying to recommend a specific side deck. Feel free to use whatever tech cards you think are best for current meta."

Even during it's ""old school"" days playing with Ryu Kokki, Pyramid Turtle, and Zombie Master, they have always intrigued me. There ability to spam the board with multiple monsters has always been an ability for them, but something has always been missing.  Be that as it may, I still do love playing with this incarnation of Zombies seeing the Shiranui archetype can be so active on the field, graveyard and banish zones. All in one turn! It's field disruption ability is quite good since Squire and Squiresaga came out, it does not negate. Which is all the rage when it comes to top-tier decks.  So the way I use this deck is as a tool-box deck, which means going second (which I tend to lean to when creating decks).  The side deck is incomplete at best, housing both tech-cards (Dragon's Mirror, Swordmaster) and actual side deck cards (Twin Twister) ."

This particular card and other cards that support are not as strong as the more popular and powerful archetype and is agreed throughout the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! the counterpart of the Blue Eyes White Dragon series.  Even though Red Eyes IS the key card in this deck, there are other monsters that can be a hassle. The true boss of the Red Eyes archetype, this is my opinion, is Dragun of Red Eyes. It is tremendously powerful monster and can be easily summoned with Red eyes Fusion and having Red Eyes and (sorry forgot to add it in when I was making the deck) the newly added Dark Magician plus a dragon effect monster, you would have an unfair advantage at the start. That is why I added not one but two more Red Eyes Fusion Cards to have an even higher chance of getting this menace of a monster. I also added Wee Witch just to give all the dark attributes on your side of the field a boost."

Bandits have never been more dangerous!  Quiet life for a shut down of any combos, together with Lose 1 Turn they stun your opponent into oblivion.  Beatdown deck, so the best equip for me is moon mirror shield and power of the guardians makes your monsters invincible to destruction.  Extra net for the occasional extra deck summon your opponent might make.  Extra deck is mostly there for pot of extravagance, but may come in clutch.  Would like to hear suggestions and criticism!!"

Your main first plays will usually get trying to get out Morphtroninc Celfon and using either Where Arf Thou? (to pull out a Morphtronic Smartfon from your deck) or Machine Duplication to get two more Celfons.  If you don't have a Celfon in hand, you should be able to still add it with a Where Arf Thou? Or One For One.  Celfon is also a great target to use for linking into Linkuriboh and you can either get it back right away with Junk Box, Morphtroninc Repair Unit, World Legacy Succession, or Monster Reborn allowing you to use its special summon effect all over again to get out more. Morphtroninc Smartfon is a great card that can special summon itself by banishing a Morphtronic monster from your graveyard. While in attack position he can add any Morphtronic card (monster, spell, or trap) from the excavated cards to your hand. While in defense Smartfon can let you change the order of cards on top of your deck according to the die roll, or even just put them on the bottom of the deck.  Smartfon is also a tuner and being level 1 is fantastic because it allows you to synchro him with a Celfon for a Formula Synchron, or with a Staplen or Boomboxen for Naturia Beast, or just use him in any Link Summon. Morphtronic Lantron is another level 1 tuner but will mainly be used as a Where Arf Thou? To get Smartfon or One For One to get your Celfon. Morphtronic Scopen is a level 3 Tuner that can special summon a level 4 Morphtronic monster from your hand in which you will either Link Summon or Synchro Summon a Power Tool Dragon to search out a equip spell, Either D.D.R. Different Dimension Reincarnation, to Special Summon something banished from Smartfon or Morphtronic Repair Unit to Special Summon something from your graveyard, such as your Celfon, to use all over again. Scopen can also be used to synchro summon into an armory arm using a Celfon. Morphtronic Slingen allows you to tribute another Morphtronic monster you control to destroy one card your opponent controls. This can also fuel your graveyard with a target to banish for Smartfon or any of your revival Spell Cards. This deck is still a work in progress and I would very much appreciate any feedback. And as I don't have a Side Deck yet I would very much appreciate it."

This deck that utilizes Guardragon combo to super charge destruction sword combo and cause compl,"Okay so this is the final version of this deck tried, tested and true. So the strategy is advanced since the last posting and is more consistent.  Special summon (using dragon shrine or pendulum call to send it to the graveyard) Darkwurm to bring Gate zero to your hand. ( if you use darkwurm as a discard for pendulum call, it’s an easy plus 2; bringing harmonizing and white wing to your hand).  Normal summon summon a level 4 or lower dragon monster. Buster welp’s effect adds dragon of the destruction sword or memories to your hand. But if it dracoslayer that’s fine too. Link summon into Romulus, adding dragon ravine to your hand. Discard a card (mermories) and send tempest to your graveyard  use gate zero and any 8 scale apart from harmonizing magician for your pendulum scale. (harmonizing is to valuable when pendulum summoned but if it has to be done it has to be). Pendulum summon the harmonizing, darkwurm from your extra deck and dracoslayer if you have it, white wing magician if you have it and leave a zone open.  Upon pendulum summoning harmonizing special summon dragoncaller from you deck. And sychro summon Star eater. (Due to dragoncaller a effect if it attacks a dragon monster then it’s attack becomes 6400). Or special summon celestial to sychro summon beleeze.  link summon Elpy and pisty using darkwurm and other level 4 or lower dragon monster. Special summon another darkwurm from your deck. Sychro Summon Buster dragon in defense using white wing and darkwurm. (This turns all opponents monster to dragons). Then special summon another dragon from your grave yard using pisty.  link summon skull dread using pisty, Elpy, Romulus and dragon to break guardragon lock. Drawing 4 cards (if you haven’t got a buster blader in your hand already that’s the card you need.) If not add level 7 monster. Skull dreads effect to special summon buster blader and activate tempest effect banishing Elpy and pisty to special summon itself. Xyz summon odd-eyes absolute then link summon into protector welp of the destruction sword using absolute and skull dread. Which special summons odd-eyes vortex. Now if memories or dragon of the destruction sword are not in your graveyard use protector welp effect to send which ever one isn’t to the graveyard.  Now that buster blader, any dragon monster, dragon of the destruction sword and destruction sword memories are all in the graveyard, activate memories banishing buster blader and a dragon monster (not dragon of the destruction sword) and fusion summon dragon destroyer. ATTACK  if you did not attack with dragon destroyer upon ending your turn protector welp then does damage to your opponent equal to dragon destroyers attack (which if there’s dragons on the field or graveyard then that’s quite a lot).  If you did not end the duel upon your opponent next turn activate buster dragons effect equipping dragon destroyer with dragon of the destruction sword locking your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck.  dont forget that in situations where this combo gets negated or you get a brick hand (in aspects to this combo) Big Eye can come in real clutch just remember to bait any negate first. Flare metal can also come in handy if your in a position where burning their life points is needed. UPDATE: so I added mystic mine prevention, my main strategy against this is MIND CRUSH. It’s an old card and has gone under the radar as far a prevention of this scorn of a card. Just make sure you bait the negate first. Dust barrier is also an older card that can come in real handy in this situation if you have multiple normal monsters on the field they are unaffected for 2 turns which can end the duel. And if all else fails dark hole all your monsters they are pendulum after all and have mystic mine destroy itself.  but that’s it, get your game on and high five the sky"

Be carefull with your summoning order. You can easily finish with a Borreload Savage Dragon + Crystron + another synchro monster + apo and/or Block Dragon.  If you summon apo tributing I:P, it will prevent destruction by cards effects. Summon I:P first and then Crystron. Your main goal going first is to get Block Dragon ASAP but without skipping Raptite (or making the summon impossible). Link summon using Block Dragon to trigger effect. Usually, i get Gigantes + Seeker + Researcher (gigantes will be easily Special summoned).  &nbsp;  Missus Radiant is just here for a T3 if your ressources are low. It can trigger Block Dragon, boost Earth Monsters and can get back a monster from GY. Never play it T1.  &nbsp;  Try to play this link order! I:P =&gt; Crystron =&gt; Apollousa (if you can).  &nbsp;  On opponent turn, you can disrupt monster effects and some spell cards (with Savage and/or Dragite). Don't forget to use Crystron effect ASAP, and decide which monster to synchro after (Sattelite, Crystal Wing  or Final Sigma (only in extra monster zone for this one if possible).  &nbsp;  Here are some videos going first or second, and some combos.  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Q9q7codG0</a>  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOgP9KAU-a4</a>  &nbsp;  Going first, you're very weak against Nibiru, really, or Kaijus.

Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?,"Pros:  -Strong blowout effects  -Decent grind game  -Explosive strength  Cons:  -Can brick  -Don't have too much choice over which gameplan (Metaphys or Thunder Dragon), unless you open really well  -Can be slow to get going  &nbsp;  The deck overall is quite fun. It's an updated version of my prior variant, except with a heavier focus on the Metaphys portion. It makes use of cards like Aloof Lupine, Lightray Grepher, Crossout Designator and Gold Sarcophagus to banish the cards it wants from the deck to access different gameplans. I'm also utilizing Crystrons, since both Quan and Citree work rather well with the deck, since they can either banish monsters from gy to get their banish effs, or get monsters out of the hand and into the gy. This variant isn't nearly as explosive as other Thunder Dragon decks, but it makes up for that by having power Metaphys boardwipes."

Board wipe loop AND OTK, with a scrap package, and True King of All Calamities.","Machina Trains. A stupid OTK deck with a solid grind game and a good (if not amazing) plan for going first. The deck is still a blind second deck. I ended on 41 cards, which feels all right. It might help reduce seeing bricks like Scrap Golem, but more importantly, the deck is refined to the point that all of the cards feel truly essential.  We're running 0 hand traps. Instead we have a 9 going second cards, 3 Dark Ruler No More, 3 Kaijus, and 3 Lightning Storm. Dark Ruler is now in the main deck. It makes sense, and since other people are doing it I might as well, you need to be able to break through Adimancipator somehow. The Kaijus are notable, since we're running Level 10 Machine monsters. That means you can search Kaijus off of Urgent Schedule when using it as fodder in the scrap combo going first, you can use Anger Knuckle if it's in your GY to special summon it or a level 10 from your hand, you can send it to the GY for the special summon on Machina Fortress, and most importantly you can use multiple copies to make Rank 10s, important in trains.  We have 8 different starters, and a strange variety of them. Going first, Machina Metalcruncher is the most important. You can use it to make True King of All Calamities while searching a Bullet Train, which is already better than Night Express. It can also search different combo pieces (with luck). We need 2 so we can search a second copy with Megaform to make Ranks 9s, but you can also use Flying Pegasus to make True King. Notably, the effect still works if special summoned by Flying Pegasus.  Flying Pegasus is technically a starter, and is an okay normal summon to help make rank 10s and start combos. But its real purpose is to be searched off of Revolving Switchyard. The second copy just means you can still use Switchyard to pull it out of the deck if you see one in your hand but have a better normal summon. We still need 1 Night Express Knight, to search off of the Switchyard and start plays.  The last 3 are Scrap Recycler. Recycler is insane with Machina Citadel and Urgent Schedule, going first or second. With Gizmek Orochi and Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion he's a one card Borrelsword Dragon with Gizmek Orochi as def position fodder and extra damage. Going first he's an easy Apollousa. Going second, you have Urgent Schedule for that board, plus Machina Citadel. This is lower end for the deck as well. You can play through multiple negations and still pull this off as well, since these are 1 or 2 card combos in the hand. This is the main starter of the deck, and generally our want to use him to send Machina Fortress.  All 6 of the Trains special summons are here. You need 3 each of Derricrane and Bullet Train so that you can find easy level 10s with Machina Metalcruncher. Derricrane is my favourite, put that under Super Dora... Mmm yummy. But my favourite Train, by far, are the 2 copies of Machina Citadel. This is a combo piece, a free-floating effect for your rank 10s, and a reasonable line of disruption all at the same time. You need at least 2 copies, for 2 reasons. 1 is so that you can loop Citadels, forcing players to banish your Citadel or destroy it twice in one turn to get rid of it, and giving you a board wipe every turn. The second, more important reason,is so that if you've pulled a Citadel out of the GY with its effect or Flying Pegasus, you can use Machina Megaform to pull out the second citadel and make a Rank 10 (with a cool floating effect to summon Citadel on destruction).  2 Machina Fortress are necessary. You can make rank 7s with Flying Pegasus, but being able to make Rank 7s with Machina Megaform and Fortress on the field is essential to ending with more than just a Fortress on the field. Don't get me wrong, its a reasonably obnoxious beat stick, but by making Dacossack you can go into Auroradon to make Borreload Savage Dragon. The fact that this card is not once per turn is insane, so long as you have machine monsters with lots of stars in your hand you can keep summoning it, which is how you make some of your link plays, and part of how you set up Anger Knuckle.  Machina Irradiator and Machina Megaform are a combo that grabs any machina out of your deck, and are common targets for Machina Redeployment. Megaform is the more impressive - it gives a Fortress you're using as a beatstick a cool floating effect, helps make Dingirsu with 3 Materials going first, and actually has applications so long as you've got access to Fortress, whereas Irradiator is basically just used to destroy your own cards for Citadel, and to pull Megaform out of the GY to make Xyz plays.  The last 9 cards are card advantage engines. Machina Redeploment is a free citadel on the field, and lets you set up hands with more Machina cards for Machina link combos. Switchyard is free special summons, and can even do it on your opponent's turn, though limited copies of Flying Pegasus does hamper its usefulness slightly. It also serves as another way to fix you hand and start combo, like Redeployment. I've already talked about the insane advantage you can get off of Urgent Schedule. The card is busted.  You can add a Halqifibrax combo with Jet Synchron, Deskbot 001, Halqifibrax, and Herald of the Arc Light. This just gives you an alternative route out of Scrap Recycler, which is good going first. I tried the package, didn't like it, and now I'm back to this list."

Pegasus places Zenith on s/t zone as continuous spell, use Zenith in s/t zone ss another Pegasus, ss Verte for Rainbow Neos or Utopia Double for OTK (you can play 2 Double or Nothing because our win condition is very limited).  Crystal lineup: Rainbow and Rainbow Dark Dragon (for chaos play, since you need to play 2 so your Zenith always can activate from s/t zone), 3 Pegasus (your main starter, a wind too for Miracle Fusion play), 1 Crystal Beast Tiger (another fodder if u run out of Pegasus), Crystal Promise (ss Crystal beast from s/t zone), 3 Crystal Bond (adds Pegasus and can place Zenith on s/t zone like Pegasus), 3 Rainbow Bridge (adds Bond or Promise, not once per turn), that's all mainly just to turbo Pegasus out, making us running roughly 9 starters.  Neos lineup: 1 Neos (material), 3 Neos Fusion (Verte target, can be Rainbow Neos fodder to spin backrows too while giving it protection ), Miracle Fusion (Verte target, luckily Great Tornado works with Pegasus to complement our go 2nd strat).  The rest are just handtraps and kaijus (with light/dark attribute, kaiju can be free lv8 too) with some breaking board cards.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/MBj3LFu.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent 1 card starter, able to break most of the meta board with non-destruction non-targeting play, can put in big damage and even OTK, strategy is not very well known among player.  Cons: Red-Eyes Dragoon play is better than Rainbow Neos, cant always put lethal damage in 1 turn, going first is very bad (needs side deck or more extra deck choices).  Cards to think of: Ruby Carbuncle (good extender, but not a starter and needs another card to be online), other Crystal s/t (most of them are bad and have ridiculous requirement), Effect Veiler (good light target for chaos play but we can easily send another light like Neos to GY, Imperm is better too)."

This deck can brick a lot, as with any dec","If you are like me, than you like fusion decks, combo decks, or top tier decks. Invoked Shaddoll is kind of a hard deck to play well, seeing as how there are so many options you can choose from depending on your starting hand (if you don’t brick, of course). The deck is also very good at stopping your opponent from playing the game, going first or second. For going first, your main goal is to end on a board of Apollousa for three, Mechaba, Winda, and either a Raidjin or Caliga (preferably Raidjin because than you can’t get super-polyd, if I’m not mistaken). But if you brick, which is easy to do with this deck, your secondary goal is to at least bring out Winda, as it is unaffected by your opponents card effects, and they can only special summon once per turn. For going second, you can do one of two things (from what I’ve learned with the deck): 1. If you have Aleister, which is by far the best card in the deck, you can normal summon him, activate his effect to add Invocation from your deck to your hand, than link him off for Almiraj, than use Invocation to fuse Aleister in the grave and Almiraj (both get banished) to summon Purgatrio, which gains 400 attack for each monster and can attack all monsters once each, and 2. Do the standard combo (Aleister + Wendi/Squamata + Damage Juggler), but instead of Apollousa, you end on a Borrelsword instead, which is a lot riskier, but will more than likely kill your opponent."
