Will explain how it works if asked but after reading each card and playing around with it its self evident.  Board Possibilities:  1) Simorgh Link, Apex Avian, Barrier Statute, Harpie's feather storm (extra simorgh monster to protect link if possible)  2) Simorgh Link, Dark Simorgh, Anti-Spell Fragrance, Harpie's feather storm (extra simorgh monster to protect link if possible)  Any mix of the above can be made if you have the extenders. Use the Simorgh spells to extra-normal summon Avian without tributing if you have it in your hand. You can also end on the other two big simorgh birds but they aren't as good. If you manage to get traptrick or harpie's feather storm in conjuction with either/both of dark simorgh+spell fragrance or avian+barrier statute, or both, your opponent will quit.  Only weakness if evenly matched. Save Apex Avian or Simorgh of Darkness's effect(s) for this. Link Simorgh makes them all immune to infinite impermanence, so for the most part traps that can be played directly from the hand aren't a threat despite normally being capable or circumventing the simorgh lock."

Haven't really played Yu-Gi-Oh in a while, but this little patch should clear up a good part of the deck clutter that I experienced with it.  A really few really nice combos I discovered while play-testing.  You can summon 'Silent Wobby' to your opponents side of the field, and not only do you gain 2000 life-points, wobby also acts as fodder to start that kaiju brawl.  if you start with 'Owner's Seal in your hand, you can instead of Special Summoning two kaijus, summon 1 to your opponent's side of the field then retake control of it leaving your opponent theoretically defenseless.  In the current META due to 20 minute long combos that involve lots of tributing and discarding and effect activating getting 'Kyoutou Waterfront' out on the field is essential!  'Neo-Spacian Grand Mole' can make a pretty nifty loop combo, by tributing your opponents boss monster to summon a kaiju before sp. summoining your own and normal summoning 'Grand Mole', you can attack your opponent's kaiju with 'Grand Mole' and send it back to your hand leaving them without a boss monster, you can continue this loop almost infinitely.  KUMONGOUS. IS. IMPORTANT. negating your opponent's ability to activate effects and attack in this current META is the best thing you can do, it can and will cancel their combo's leaving them wide open. if you find yourself against an overly effect reliant deck such as sky-strikers, time lords or subterrors Kumongous can throw off their entrie strategy, and paired with Kyoutou Waterfront, is really self sustainable.  Be mindful when summoning Gameciel to your opponents side of the field. Yes, he is the weakest Kaiju monster stat wise but thats a balancing chip with him. If there are readily accesible kaiju counters while once you've summoned Gameicel its better to take him out first before going for any potentially game ending effects (like Dogoran's)."

This is the most consistent build you will find.  Once more i searched the web trying to find a good decklist for this deck, i didn't find the perfect one, so i had to make one myself.  <strong>Servants of the Sun:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Before you summon your Egyptian God you need to summon his pawns, for that you have <strong>Sangan</strong>, the starter of the Deck, if you don't open your hand with him don't worry, <strong>Tour Guide Of The Underworld</strong> searches it for you.</li>  	<li>When you dump <strong>Sangan</strong> for a Link Summon be it <strong>Almiraj</strong> or <strong>Masquerena</strong> you will search for <strong>Arboria</strong>, your extender. Then you will make the most boring combo nowadays and abuse <strong>Halqifibrax</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Arboria</strong> Special Summons itself from your hand, so you Link into <strong>Halqi</strong>, Summon <strong>O-Lion</strong> from your deck, Link <strong>Halqi</strong> into <strong>Linkross</strong>, Synchro Summon the Level 3 <strong>Metal Marcher</strong> and Special Summon <strong>Arboria</strong> from the GY.</li>  	<li>With the Token summoned by <strong>O-Lion</strong>, you go into <strong>Union Carrier</strong>, target <strong>Arboria</strong> in your field and equip <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> to her, there's still one Level 1 Token left, so you Synchro Summon <strong>Hastorr</strong> for maximum ATK Points and Monster Steal or <strong>Arc Light</strong> for the negate, thus dumping <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> and enabling you to search any card that supports <strong>Ra</strong>.</li>  	<li>You can also use <strong>Crystal Girl</strong>, to search for <strong>Guardian Slime</strong>. One for One facilitates that.</li>  	<li><strong>Temple of the Kings</strong> allows you to activate <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong> in the same turn it is set, so you can summon <strong>Ra</strong> more easily.</li> </ul> <strong>Bringing the Sun to the battlefield:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Now that the offerings are in your field, you can use them as tributes for the Sun God, there are a lot of scenarios that can happen, the most common one is that you search <strong>Ancient Chant</strong> with the <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> you just dumped, bring <strong>Ra</strong> to your hand and summon him.</li>  	<li>If you go first you will want to summon <strong>Sphere Mode</strong> before bringing <strong>Ra</strong> to the field so you don't spend your LP.</li>  	<li>If you already have <strong>Ancient Chant</strong> in your hand you can go for <strong>Millenium Revelation</strong>, so you can search for <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> if needed or even <strong>One With The Sun God</strong> so if anything happens to <strong>Ra</strong>, you gain your LP back.</li> </ul> <strong>Become one with the flames and bear the name of Phoenix:</strong> <ul>  	<li>You also cannot forget that you have <strong>Immortal Phoenix</strong> in your deck, and there are a two ways of sending it to the GY. One of them and the best one is <strong>Millenium Revelation</strong>, discard <strong>Phoenix</strong> and search <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>.</li>  	<li>You can also discard it for the effect of <strong>One for One</strong> in order to summon <strong>Crystal Girl</strong>.</li>  	<li>When you have it there your GY is set up as well. If <strong>Ra</strong> goes to the GY by any means, <strong>Immortal Phoenix</strong> rises from its ashes and allows you to destroy your opponent's field. <strong>One With The Sun God</strong> allows you to do that</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Some extra explanations:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Instant Fusion </strong>allows you to bring <strong>Theseus </strong>a tuner to the field, so you can make <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> most of the time.</li>  	<li><strong>Mound of the Bound Creator </strong>offers extra protection to your <strong>Winged Dragon of Ra.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Life Absorbing Machine </strong>can be replaced.</li>  	<li>Don't forget <strong>Blaze Cannon</strong> you can search it with <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> and it can decide the duel.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Any suggestions or questions leave it down below. Also you can check my profile in Dueling Book, it's <strong>_Theseus.</strong>  Now burn your opponent with the Sun itself, and make sure they become a <strong>Sun God </strong>devotee as well!"

Sloppily updated with the new support. ,"It ain't great, but they don't have much punch no matter how you run 'em, and I just like their art style. Use snowy and thundery canvas. That's the move.  Edit: The new support is fantastic. Turbo out the field spell however you must, dump stuff onto the field, and get out that link! Cloud is amazing because he recovers the spells and traps you use in the summon. Just negate stuff. That is now the play, thundery canvas still rules though."

Next you use DHoles ability to revive the other Tindangle(NOT Intruder or DHoles), then Intruder will chain the effect and will special summon itself in face down position. You should have 3 face down monsters.  Then you activate Nagel's Protection to make your Tindangles's invincible to your opponents card effects.Finally End your Turn.  When your opponents monster attacks the Tindangle, make sure they attack the Jhrelth or Intruderr to flip them face up and add 2 Tindangle monster's from your deck to your hand.  FYI Your opponent can flip Protecter to trigger its search effect that will flip all the Tindangle's and search even more cards.(About 3 if used correctly.)  Then you want to activate your searched Jhrelth to discard the TRAP Tindangle Delaunay to then activate Delaunay's effect to banish itself  to summon back the destroyed Tindangle's last turn.  But if they negated it, don't worry, just stall out for one turn. Use Trinity since he is immune to battle.  Then activate the Tindangle Delaunay that was previously negated(If it wasn't just LINK Summon Tindangle Acute Cerberus just make sure to put Tindangle Base Gardna in the GY.) to summon DHoles, Jhrelth, Protector and Intruder.  Wait for your opponent to do their turn. When they're done, you want to flip Protector face up to reveal the rest of the Tindangle's to draw 3 cards. Next, activate Jhrelth's effect to search any Tindangle.  After That, you can LINK Summon Acute Cerberus. If you use Trinity as one of the materials you can search a Gergonne's End and discard a Euler's Circuit to the GY, then activate Euler's Circuit to banish itself and discard 1 Tindangle in your hand to serach another Euler's Circuit and then activate the field spell to make it where your opponent cannot attack you if you control 3 or more Tindangle monsters which you probably already have with a lot of set-up.(Also you should activate a Nagel's Protection along with the wombo-combo you did to put a lot of Tindangle's in the GY especially Base Gardna.)When you activate Nagel and you attack with Acute Cerberus doing double damage and could OTK if u have 2 Tindangle's CO-LINKED to Acute Ceberus.

The goal is to be a Zombies deck, running Eldlich cards as a control engine. It means running 2 card combos instead of Jet Synchron, and makes the routing a little heavy on extra deck space, but the deck has follow-up and interactions for days. Let's begin.  3 Uni-Zombie and 2 Shiranui Solitaire make up an eighth of the deck, meaning odds are we'll see them in our top 8 cards. These numbers are run because with 6 it always feels like you see 2 too often. These form a 2 card combo with any of Zombie World, Glow-Up Bloom, or Necroworld Banshee. 2 Banshee and 2 Glow-Up Bloom give us access to Zombie world in the case of banshee, and the choice of Doomking Balerdroch or Eldlich the Golden Lord from Glow-Up Bloom. These numbers help ensure you see the combo reasonably often, and makes follow-up plays possible. 2 Doomking Balerdroch are the maindeck boss monsters, and make a Halquifibrax combo that ends on 3 interactions plus Zombie World. Vampire Fraulein is an OTK with Dragonecro, in addition to being a level 5 combo piece and defensive hand trap. Worth it as a 1 of in the Zombie build, because you can summon it with Eldlixers, and pure Zombies plays it anyways. Rivalry of Warlords locks people out of playing non-zombie monsters with Zombie World, and is basically a Zombie card. Super Poly is likewise a zombie card, and is a 1 of to search it with Predaplant Verte Anaconda to make Dragonecro super poly as a link 2, just a 3rd line of play that's good going second, basically. 3 Zombie World is essential, half of our deck only works if this card is on the field, so playing 3 with everyone running Cosmic Cyclone for Eldlich seems like a good idea.  For the Eldlich half of the deck, we have pretty standard numbers with some minor trims for deckspace reasons. 3 Golden Lord is pretty standard. Zombies plays 2 of these anyways, and we need to have more Golden Lords than we do Eldlich cards in a game. They're gonna get banished so 3 is essential in my opinion. 3 Cursed Eldland is insane, if find you Golden Lord, it finds you other interaction, it sets up your GY, this card is also nuts with Performapal Popperup going first. It's also one of the Eldlich combo extenders needed for second string follow-ups / alternatives. 3 Scarlet Sanguine, but only 2 Black Awakening and 1 White Destiny. Different names are important, as is recuring zombie threats such as golden lord and Balerdroch. These 6 cards are all also extenders in second string plays. 2 each of Conquistador and Huaquero is pretty standard, these are the meat of the deck, and combo pieces. 1 Golden Land Forever gives us a searchable omni-negate, good in games when you just go off on turn one, and pretty okay in middling games as well. I'd run 2, but space is tight.  3 Performapal Popperup is our card draw of choice. I know it works well in Eldlich, and it definitely has synergies in Zombies. Drawing 3 cards deeper into the deck while pitching cards for fun and profit leads to some extreme highs, and it can mitigate middling hands as a mulligan in a pinch. Better than Souls' here because we want to pitch monsters about as often as spells/traps.  Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion is a brick, but it makes the Herald+Raptite combo possible. Ghost Ogre is not a complete brick, but it here to be an extra interruption off of Needlefibre. Easy money. We even make the Ghost Girl a ghost with Zombie World.  Extra deck space is tight. 3 Needlefibre are essential. 2 are used in the deck's main combo, and 1 is used in follow-up plays. Linkuriboh makes Glow-Up Bloom into full combo with Zombie World, which just increases the odds of seeing 2 card Needlefibre combos more often. Linkross, Martial Metalmarcher, and Wonder Magician go into Borreload Savage on your opponent's turn + Herald of the Arc Light on yours, plus maybe a spell/trap pop with Wonder Magician out of our 2 card Needlefibres.  The second engine is a 3 card combo, but a fairly redundant one to put together, which ends on Ghost Ogre + Huquero/Conquistador interruption + Dawn Dragster on their turn, which draws a card off Formula Synchron. You can even use Fraulein for added consistency.  The last string of plays is Predaplant Verte Anaconda to Super Poly their monsters into Dragonecro. I'd love to run more of these, but space is sooo tight in the main and extra.  Train cards eventually win games by OTKs. Red Splatter makes this much easier.  Combo 1 can be done with a bunch of cards, but for simplicity, we'll focus on Uni-Zombie + Zombie World. <ol>  	<li>Play Zombie World</li>  	<li>Play Uni-Zombie</li>  	<li>Send Glow-Up Bloom to GY</li>  	<li>Banish Bloom, ss Balerdroch</li>  	<li>Link Balerdroch and Uni-Zombie into Needlefibre, ss O-Lion.</li>  	<li>Link Needlefibre in Linkross, ss 2 tokens.</li>  	<li>Synchro O-Lion and a token into Martial Metalmarcher. O-lion chain 2, Marcher chain 1, ss token, ss Uni-Zombie.</li>  	<li>Synchro Marcher + level 3 token into Raptite with O-lion in the GY. Synchro Herald of the Arclight.</li>  	<li>During opponents standby phase ss Balerdroch.</li> </ol> Zombie World locks you out of Auroradon.  Combo 2 involves previously mentioned Zombie cards plus a bunch of combinations of Eldlich cards. For simplicity, we'll use Uni-Zombie, Zombie World, and Red Splatter. <ol>  	<li>Play Zombie World</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Uni-Zombie. Send Glow-Up Bloom to the GY.</li>  	<li>Banish Glow-Up Bloom, ss Golden Lord.</li>  	<li>Link Uni-Zombie and Golden Lord into Needlefibre, ss Ghost Ogre.</li>  	<li>Set Red Eldlixir.</li>  	<li>ss Golden Lord, send red splatter to the GY.</li>  	<li>Banish Red Eldlixir for your choice of Conquistador and Huaquero.</li>  	<li>Opponents turn you have Ghost Ogre, an Eldlich Trap, and you can banish Needlefibre to ss Formula Synchron, draw a card, and synchro it and the level 5 monster into Dawn Dragster for a negate.</li> </ol> The third-string play is just Super Poly out of Verte Anaconda, a power play for sure and great going second to break boards.  Profile already changed. Basically I'm trying to make the grind game more consistent."

Ideally you need to go first, this deck will struggle vs an established board. If you can make Gallant Granite before Halq, do it and the opponent will be forced to negate it. Gallant and Doki are cards the opponent are forced to negate otherwise they'll give you too much advantage. If you can resolve Halq then go for Martial Metal Marcher combos and it should be off to the races. You're playing 4 copies of Block Dragon, try and hold it as long as possible or use it as material for an Apollousa. Block Dragon is how you're pushing through hand traps, without Block Dragon you're likely to lose. Worst case scenario, you can attach it using Union Carrier but you more want to save Carrier to attach Buster Dragon to force the opponent to scoop. The ideal end board should comprise of: Apollousa of at least 3 negates, Union Carrier, I:P Masquerena, Herald of the Arc Light, Savage Dragon with 2 counters and Buster Dragon attached, Dweller with Tackle Crusader as material, and Block Dragon to be used with I:P to make unicorn which will then be co-linked with Carrier to go +4.  &nbsp;  Game 2 Side in the hand traps and try to block the opponent's combo as best you can. You have 14 hand traps to work with, all of which can either block Halq Combos or stop Auroradon/Linkross combos, so use them wisely. Game 3 side in exchange to get rid of dark ruler or anything else that can threaten your board. Toughest matchup is the mirror since its very die roll dependent. Its not impossible to win going second vs the mirror but its quite an uphill battle if you dont open imperm or nibiru."

The best I could come up with was Lightsworns since they have couple of Beast-Warriors to go for Eagle and use as material for Swan. They can also mill cards to grave which helps with Eagle's, Panda's and Dragon's effects. The spells can also mill Wulf which makes summoning arguably the most improtant card of the deck, Eagle, easier. I first tried using Luminas instead of Aurkus, Lightsworn Monk but kept constantly wanting Lumina to be a Beast-Warrior type so I changed it. I think adding the Lightsworns made the deck brick less and make better combos but it is still quite bricky and starting the combos needs a bit too much resources compared to some meta decks for example. Hence the lack of hand traps and other generic protection and destruction cards.  <strong>Replays</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuc22l4xps"

The deck can go first or second, but in my experience, it's probably best just to go first and try to prevent your opponent from building an unstoppable board.  There's definitely some room for experimentation here! For example, you may consider running the wind invoked monster in place of Apollousa or Dweller. Or maybe you want to do the whole buster lock thing with Union Carrier.  The deck can be super strong and in the right hands keep up with the best! It's a fun deck and people will be happy to take a break from all the Eldies and Rock People. Have fun with it and let me know if you have any cool ideas to help refine the list!"

The combo is we make <strong>2 lv7 on field</strong> and overlay it to Ebon Illusion Magician to fetch our tuner Magicalibra for Halqifibrax combo. Toon Dark Magician and Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon easily accompolish that, so we play to turbo both. Cards like The Black Stone of Legend (our main normal summon, ss Red-Eyes from deck), Magicians Souls (fetches Toon DM to gy or ss og DM as lv7 fodder), Toon Table of Contents (adds any Toon, mostly Toon DM as Toon Red-Eyes can summon it from hand), Where Arf Thou (works with both Black Stone and Magicians Souls), One for One, Dark Magic Veil (ss dark spellcaster from hand or gy, works with DM lineup), and lastly Tenyi Adhara (tuner lv1) or Vishuda (lv7 with bounce effect).  The Halqifibrax combo with Borreload Savage Dragon and Herald of the Arc Light is very suitable to this deck as it only uses small extra deck space and can search Relinquished lineup as follow up play. Fusion lineup is for either Eyes Restrict or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (since we run og DM, I think Dragoon is the best addition here), being Instant Fusion and Magicalized Fusion (Millenium-Eyes Restrict or Dragoon). Not only that, Dark Magic Veil can revive both Eyes Restrict and Dragoon too. We also use spellcaster support like Selene for Accescode since the Toon spell easily dump 3 spells and we run bunch of spellcaster anyway. Can put in Chimeratech Megafleet too as we have Toon Cyber Dragon. Toon Briefcase is just another search target and we can make it online if we have Toon monster for spare. Kaiju works well too, either as Relinquished fodder or lv7 xyz material. Imduk is there to utilize og DM with Magicalized Fusion for Dragoon.  We dont play the Toon Kingdom lineup as it banishes 3 cards from deck (we have combo pieces) and while its protection effect is good, sitting on Toon monsters aint good enough. Relinquished also clashes with Toon as Relinquished is super good going second while most of the Toons cant atk the turn they are summoned, so this deck is made to synergize both Relinquished and Toon.  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/e/e5/MaximillionPegasus-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Themed, good board setup with follow up, consistency is borderline acceptable.  Cons: Board is easily broken, lack of recursion, both Toon DM and Red-Eyes cant atk the turn it is summoned and only have moderate atk as beater."

Use your chaotic giant to blast your opponent to smithereens, while hitting them with an onslaught of cannons, and finding ways ","Win.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think that's a good enough strategy, but you can win easier with this advice:  Use earth effigy/torjan horse or ancient gear castle to summon ancient gear golem, which you can get to your hand with ancient gear wyvern, or just by drawing it(with for example cardcar D). Fusion summon Chaos ancient gear giant to destroy your opponent, and double it's attack with limiter removal. All the while your cannons can be doing damage to your opponent.  yay :D  Some cards to add: Monster reborn, super express bullet train.
