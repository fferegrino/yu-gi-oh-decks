You can add Accesscode Talker, Baronne de Fleur and Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden in place of Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Ultimaya Tzolkin and Clara &amp; Rushka, the Ventriloduo.

Some cards in this deck provide means to play through interruptions. Fairy Tail - Snow can banish 7 cards from Hand, Grave and/or Field to Special Summon itself. Let's say your Tornado Dragon or Artifact Scythe is being negated, you can simply banish whichever is being negated and resolve the effect. You can send Fairy Tail - Snow to Grave through Timestar Magician. Fairy Tail - Snow can also be used to interrupt the 1st summon of the opponent.

You can also do the same with Time Pendulumgraph, but you need to have Timestar Magician on the Field. Using Time Pendulumgraph and Timestar Magician, we can play through 2 interruptions. Let's say Tornado Dragon is being negated by Infinite Impermanence (We need a card on your opponent Field for this to work), chain Time Pendulumgraph and activate its effect. Select 1 Pendulum card in your Pendulum Scale and Infinite Impermanence. Timestar Magician will then trigger its effect to protect the Pendulum card by sending 1 card to Grave and that card is Fairy Tail - Snow. Since only 1 card was destroyed, Time Pendulumgraph will activate its effect to send 1 card on the field to Grave, so send Tornado Dragon and that's how you dodge the Infinite Impermanence. Now, Artifact Scythe is on the field since Tornado Dragon's effect resolved. When Artifact Scythe tries to activate, let's say you opponent tries to negate it. Simply, chain Fairy Tail - Snow banishing 7 cards from Hand, Grave and/or Field including Artifact Scythe to dodge the negation once again.

Regarding the combo in Duel 1, instead of summoning a lvl 4 using Harmonizing Magician's effect, summon Oafdragon Magician and Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur instead of Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer. The link 1 is used to send Fairy Tail - Snow to Grave in the off chance she's your only summon, so you can use her as an interruption.

In the gameplay, I once opted to not use Astrograph Sorcerer's effect after I destroyed a card I control thinking I can add it using Oafdragon Magician (It can only add 1 face-up ""Magician"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" Pendulum Monster from your Extra Deck to your hand). The correct way would have been to Pendulum Summon, XYZ Timestar Magician, Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur OR XYZ Tornado Dragon, Link Astrograph Sorcerer with another card into Artifact Dagda and use Timestar Magician's effect to add Astrograph Sorcerer from the Extra Deck. Use Baronne de Fleur OR Tornado Dragon to destroy the scale (Don't protect using Timestar Magician) and Special Summon Astrograph Sorcerer from your hand and add a card from deck. The rest depends on your hand.

Props to Trif Gaming for the combos and the profile.

The main idea of the deck is to the use adventurer engine to help protect the main Halq/Auroradon/Penguin combos. The deck can play with or without the adventurer engine, so cards like deep sea diva are fine in bot cases.

Notes:

I often find myself never using a dark hole, feather duster, or lightning storm in 1 for 2+ situations. I either have a face-up monster and don't want/cant DH or LS or I don't need to use HFD as the deck offers so many negate they tend to stay in the hand. may try running them sideboard in lieu of something else.

. Excluding the dualities, this isn't the actual side deck but rather a collection of options that can easily be used at  2-3 for a side or mainboard

1 Copy of Archfiend (The deck works fine with 2)

&nbsp;

The main cards that I suggest you don't change the amounts of are:

Infernity Conjurer (This card is a crazy good combo piece) because of its SS from GY effect (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Conjurer"">https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Conjurer</a>)

Infernity Inferno because it is a great way to discard Dark worlds and send combo pieces like Conjurer to the grave (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Inferno"">https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Inferno</a>)

Infernity Sage (Also an insane combo piece) because once per turn you can <span><strong>discard</strong></span><strong> </strong>(triggering DW effects) your entire hand. Also while you have no cards in hand when it is sent to the gy (By foolish burial, Battle, Card effect, Sync/Link summon) while you have no cards in hand, you can send an additional infernity to the GY. (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Sage"">https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Infernity_Sage</a>)

I do play this deck on Master Duel and it is quite fun.

Anyway, Enjoy the decklist!"

The deck follows the standard Dark Magician starts of playing Dragoon but uses the new Battle of Chaos cards.
Generally, you would probably play 2-3 Illusion of Chaos (You can probably go down to 1 or 2 Timaeus), I only pulled 1 and it's still worth running at 1 since it's super easy to search since you can use Soul Servant to top deck it and draw (which you can search for with circle and rod), then immediately activate it and just keep it in your hand forever grabbing whatever DM monster you want.

If you have the cards another Dragoon you can remove Dark Cavalry for it.

I generally side out Magician's Nav, Eye of Timaeus and one of the Timaeus Dragons for the general set of 2-3 cards that I would want depending on matchup."

I then activate Numeron Network's effect to activate Numeron Calling, allowing me to Special Summon Numbers 1-4 on my field. If Memories of Hope is on my hand, then I activate it allowing me to draw 4 cards since 4 Xyz monsters are on the field. I then Xyz Summon Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya using Number 1 as Xyz material. Sunya's effect banishes all monsters on the field. If Swift Scarecrow is in my hand, then I do not summon any monsters for the rest of the turn, because Swift Scarecrow can be immediately sent to my graveyard if my opponent declares a direct attack. In doing so, the battle phase immediately ends, negating the direct attack. I then Special Summon Sunya during my next Standby Phase with it's effect. Then the opponent takes 1000 LP worth of damage for each of my banished monsters. If I have Foolish Burial Goods, then I use it to send a Numeron Network from my deck to my graveyard. I then activate one of my monster effects from cards such as Exiled Force, Unchained Twins Aruha, etc, to destroy my Chaos Gate Sunya, and send it to my Graveyard. I then activate Numeron Network's effect to send Numeron Chaos Ritual to my graveyard. This allows me to use any 4 Xyz monsters + Numeron Network in my graveyard or banished, to Xyz summon Number C1000 Numeronius. It gains 10,000 ATK if summoned this way. If it is destroyed by an opponents card effect, I then Xyz summon Number iC1000 Numeronius Numerounia from my Extra Deck and attatch Numeronius to it as Xyz material. Numerounia gains 100,000 ATK/DF if Summoned this way only during the opponent's turn."

I've been tweaking it for a while, but here's what I play right now. The combos are all intuitive and complicated, so it takes lots of practice to be able to consistently play the deck well. One of the best lines is overlaying Copernicus and Gryphon into Caesar, and then linking off Caesar and another monster (usually Lamia) for Cross-Sheep. This will give you lots of material in grave because the pendulums won't get sent to the extra deck, and it will search Swamp King to trigger the Cross-Sheep with. With this deck, it's pretty important to manage your tuners. Most of your best end board cards are synchros, so you don't want to run out of Lamias. The Ghost is usually your Halqifibrax target. Your Gilgamesh targets are almost always Ragnarok and Apocalypse, unless you want a crazy pendulum summon play I guess. The dragon shrines are all for dumping Destrudo, which is a free extender. It can be used to make Dragster, Alexander, or Halq in a pinch, although you do have to be careful not to burn yourself out. I'm choosing to main deck Eternal Darkness, because I think the lock is a bit better than Patent License, but you can side Eternal Darkness out for it if that's better. The side deck and hand traps are flexible of course, but I think these are pretty good for this format. Enjoy!"

When the Charmer Structure Deck arrived in the TCG Fall 2020, duelists around the world were hit with disappointment. Highly sought-after staples like Evenly Matched was replaced by cards like Raigeki. The “Charmer” cards were lacklustre and did not do enough to please it’s fans. The promise of a playable Charmer archetype felt like another classic Komoney move – duelist’s expectations were crushed after showing lots of potential.

Functioning like a deck from 2010 rather than 2020, the deck had a swarmy beatdown playstyle held up with rickety spell/trap support in the backrow. Dismissed as a “casual DM-era waifu nostalgia bait” structure deck, most duelists neglected the charmers, branding it as one of the worst sets to come out in the TCG.

However, several new factors gave indirect support to this ailing archetype! With the new stun/control tools that the 2022 banlist enables, combined with cards from recent sets like Lord of the Heavenly Prison, Incredible Ecclesia, and Zoroa The Magistus Conflagrant Calamity the deck can actually hold its own as a control rogue deck! Functioning a lot like our favourite Golden Boy “Eldlich,” Charming Control stuns out your opponent, sets up multiple interruptions/negates and beats them down with 3000/4000ATK+ monsters!

<span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span>

The <strong>CHARMER</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 12 cards:

<em>1 of each of the Familiar-Possessed Charmers </em><em>(Earth, Water, Fire and Wind</em><em>), 3 Spirit Charmers, 2 Awakening of the Possessed, 2 Possessed Partnerships and 1 Unpossessed. </em>In the Extra Deck there is <em>1 of each of the Familiar-Possessed Charmers (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Light and Dark)</em>. The backrow Charmer Cards serve as the primary core of the deck, serving as its draw engine, recovery, and control. The Extra Deck Charmers give the player a means to link away stolen monsters.

The <strong>DOGMATIKA</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 5 cards:

<em>2 Nadir Servant, 1 Ecclesia, 1 Fleurdelis,</em> and <em>1 Punishment</em>. In the Extra Deck, <em>2 Elder Entity N’tss</em> and <em>1 Titaniklad</em> serve as the dump targets for Nadir Servant. The Dogmatika package serve as a potent form of removal, interruption and as an additional way to get extra free bodies on board.

The <strong>SWORDSOUL</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 5 cards:

<em>3 Incredible Ecclesia</em>, and <em>2 The Iris Swordsoul</em>. Both cards serve as free special summons. Incredible Ecclesia opens up synchro plays like Zoroa and Savage Dragon, while Iris Swordsoul is a strong card in itself with its many beneficial effects that offer control and card advantage.

The <strong>MAGISTUS</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 3 cards:

3 Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame. Magistus cards have much more presence in the Extra deck, consisting of 5 cards: 2 Artemis, 1 Conflagrant Calamity, 1 Vahram and 1 Aiwass. The Magistus archetype offers a toolbox of options for many situations, but Zoroa usually turbos out level 8 synchro monsters that control the board. Zoroa is a one and a half card Borreload Savage!

The <strong>STAPLE</strong> cards in this deck take up the last 15 slots in this deck.

The Staple monsters are <em>3 Lord of the Heavenly Prison</em> and <em>3 Fairy Tail – Luna</em>.

Both cards are extremely potent for the Charming Control strategy, with Lord of the Heavenly Prison searching out any Spell/Trap (usually Spirit Charmers) and protecting backrow.

Luna is low key the MVP of this deck since it fulfills the requirements to trigger Awakening of the Possessed’s +1 draw effect, bounces back opponent’s monsters with it’s quick effect, and searches any 1850ATK spellcaster!

The Staple backrow consist of 9 powerful trap cards, each chosen for their synergy with Charmers.

<em>3 Crackdown</em> and <em>3 Ice Dragon’s Prison</em> interrupt your opponent by stealing their key combo piece monster from their field/GY, which correctly timed, is often enough to end their turn. During your turn, they can be linked away into the appropriate Charmer of choice, then you can again resurrect their monster to your side of the field!

<em>3 Skill Drains</em> are the secret weapon of this deck, and this deck plays perfectly fine with this card on the field! Most interactions/plays that this deck makes is due to backrow support, and once your monsters are supported by Awakening of the Possessed, the game becomes simplified enough where it becomes caveman Yugioh – no effects, no combos, just straight up beatdown!

Cool interactions with this card and the deck include <em>The Iris Swordsoul</em>, where she can summon herself from hand for free if monsters on the field are currently negated – a condition that Skill Drain easily fulfills. <em>Incredible Ecclesia</em> can still tribute herself to summon Iris from deck, since her effect activates in the GY, and not on the field. <em>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</em> triggers and resolves IN HAND and not on the field, so it search for your spell/trap of your choice despite Skill Drain being active! Finally, extra deck cards like <em>N’Tss, Titanklad</em> and <em>Vahram</em> trigger in the GY, so they can function well with Skill Drain on the field.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span>

The cool thing about this deck is that it doesn’t feature any combos, since it’s mostly a “set 4 and normal summon -&gt; pass” style of deck, making it pretty simple to use!

The entire premise of this deck is to control your opponent with backrow, then beat them in a simplified gamestate, where beatdown with strong superior monsters reign supreme.

Depending on your hand, the most ideal turn 1 set-up would be active Charmer Spell/Traps, supported by other generic forms of interruption, like Dogmatika cards, an Borreload Savage, etc.

Awakening of the Possessed is the most important card in this case, since it boosts your monster by 300ATK for every attribute on your field, and gives you a +1 draw every time you summon a 1850 ATK spellcaster. This card STACKS, meaning multiple copies of this card can be activated for an even bigger attack boost, so instead of +300 for every attribute, you get +600 if you have two copies! Before you know it, your opponent may be staring down a 3050 ATK charmer and 5200ATK Borreload Savage Dragon!

In a grindgame this deck does reasonably well since it generates advantage in various ways. Luna gets you another 1850 spellcaster, Zoroa once equipped with Artemis can search for himself, The Iris Swordsoul gives a +2 draw if your opponent summons from deck and Awakening of the Possessed gets you +1 draw everytime you summon a 1850ATK spellcaster, which is something you’ll do often. If your opponent wipes out your entire backrow, Possessed Partnerships can re-activate a Possessed continuous Spell/Trap from the GY. Finally, all the Extra Deck charmers give you extra monsters on board by reviving your opponent’s monster, and they all float into their attribute appropriate monster from deck!

If you anticipate a grindgame, Unpossessed is an ideal card to set-up. ANY monster of yours that would be destroyed will float into a 1500 ATK spellcaster, and that would be any of the Elemental Charmers, Any Ecclesia, and Zoroa!

Speaking of Zoroa, that card is a on2 and a half card Borreload Savage Dragon! Here is the only combo this deck features:
<ol>
 	<li>Normal Summon Zoroa.</li>
 	<li>Activate Zoroa’s effect to equip Artemis from Extra Deck to him. His Trigger effect will activate, summoning a level 4 spellcaster from your hand/GY.</li>
 	<li>Activate Artemis’ searching effect to get you a Magistus monster from deck. It will be Zoroa, so you will have follow-up for next turn.</li>
 	<li>Synchro away Zoroa + the level 4 spellcaster into Borreload Savage Dragon.</li>
 	<li>Borreload Savage Dragon equips Artemis from GY, giving you one omni-negate, 1 Zoroa for next turn, and a 3400 ATK monster.</li>
</ol>
Zoroa can also turn into the Magistus Calamity (Extra Deck-specific floodgate) or Vahram (fieldwipe of opponent’s face up cards).  If you want some immediate damage, you can equip Aiwass to Zoroa instead, giving you a 2500 ATK monster so you can hit over stuff like Winda with a normal summoned monster.

After sufficiently softening up your opponent, this deck can easily generate 8000+ ATK, especially with Awakening of the Possessed on the board. This deck features lots of free special summons with high attack monsters such as Iris Swordsoul, Lord of the Heavenly Prison, and the Extra Deck Charmer’s ability to resurrect your opponent’s monster. When the time is right with your field full of Charmers and charmed monsters, SWING FOR GAME!!!

&nbsp;

<span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>The side deck options offer an expanded array of choices to control the board. Fairy Tail – Snow was recently unbanned, but using her in this deck is almost impossible, as her summoning effect cannot be fulfilled easily. The Dogmatika package can be expanded to include Shadoll cards like Winda and Schism to add an extra power boost at the cost of extra deck slots. Potent field spells like Secret Village and Ichirin are usable with Terraforming, Metaverse and Set Rotation, offering extra control/floodgate control. Finally Emergency Teleport’s target, Ghost Ogre can synchro with another Level 4 Spellcaster to summon Fortune Lady Every, and very strong boss monster.</li>
 	<li>Try to force out a simplified gamestate, where a grindgame is dominant. What this deck lacks in offensive power, it makes up for it in defensive control.</li>
 	<li>This deck can OTK in a blink of an eye, since multiple monsters/attributes on board + Awakening of the Possessed usually generates 10000+ ATK on board.</li>
 	<li>Force out with other cards your opponent’s interaction before using a particularly lethal trap that REALLY hurts your opponent – like Skill Drain (slaughters combo decks) and Ice Dragon’s Prison (banishes Eldlich to the Shadow Realm).</li>
 	<li>This deck obviously prefers to go first. However, trap cards are surprisingly good at breaking apart established boards!</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>

Okay okay I’ll admit it, I’m a big sucker and simp for the Charmers, and no matter what I do to help them out, they’ll always remain a casual deck, barely scratching the surface of becoming rogue. This is my personal strongest rendition of this deck using the tools made recently available, and they can actually hold their own versus even the top meta! Not convinced? Watch my Youtube video where Charmers battle Eldlich and Invoked/Shaddol, the Control Kings of the 2022 banlist! (forgive my lame ass video, I haven’t uploaded to Youtube for literal years. I'm gonna give a shot to Yugi-tubing casually, wish me luck!)

Seriously though, I love boosting up underpowered and overlooked decks to be able to stand their own ground versus meta, and it’s so utterly satisfying watching a magical girl strike down Eldlich with her astronomically high 3050 ATK! I hope you folks enjoy piloting this deck as much as I do! :)

You can easily OTK with one timelord (any), and bringing Eldlich to the field, going into Gustav Max, activate its effect for 2000 burn damage then Super Dora at 6000 atk and going for the kill for a total of 8000 damage in one turn.

Bear in mind that Eldlich is a level 10 monster that also benefit from the protection of Mound of the bound creator and its burn effect.

The addition of the Eldlich engine also allows you to pop problem cards that plagued traditional Timelord deck such as Skill Drain.

Bear in mind though that activating the graveyard effect of Time Maiden or the field effect of Eldlixir of Black Awakenening locks you from playing your extra deck combos, otherwise you're free to play as you want. You should also play the field effect of Eldlixir of Black Awakening at the end of your combo so it doesn't lock you from summoning other monster types."

Either to stop opponents combos by destroying monsters with Teardrop the Rikka Queen or go into Draglubion into Numeron Dragon to beatdown the opponent with 9,000 attack. Aromage Marjoram is just good insurance really and for getting rid of Shaddoll's Fusion cards in the graveyard and other decks combo pieces. Gingerbread House is a pretty odd one for a aromage deck, but it helps control the board quite well by getting rid of their bigger monsters during their standby phase. Blessed Winds is saves this deck a lot by recycling cards like Rikka Petal, Lonefire Blossom, and Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy."

It's impossible to run any other Pot card, as Extravagance and Prosperity lock you out of drawing for the turn, and in a list full of Danger! monsters you lose a lot of value. So, instead, I'm maxing out on Eater of Millions, hoping to see it rather consistently in the turns 1 to 4 to combo it with Gren Maju and finish the game right there.

The Danger! engine is quite large, as it takes a hard approach on it, even more since Nessie has been released off the banlist and is now at 3 copies. All the Danger! monsters serve the purpose of digging through your deck, put bodies on the field (especially the level 8 ones, such as Bifgfoot, Thunderbird and Ogopogo) to go into powerful XYZ monsters like Dingirsu, Draglubion (your way to cheat out Numeron Dragon) and Hope Harbinger. Even if the levels don't match, the link monsters in this deck are quite powerful, but I would really consider replacing Zeroboros with Accesscode.

Eater of Millions and Gizmek Orochi are the primary ways to banish cards, obviously including the 1-off Pot of Desires, so it's a 7/40 of cards that banish your deck/extra deck massively. With that in mind, you can't always rely on Gren Maju to OTK, and that's where the XYZ - link monsters enter in the list, as well as huge going-second powerhouses such as Pankratops, Lightning Storm, Feather Duster, Super Poly (with various targets, and specific ones for DIDS and Eldlich) and Nibiru (which is a powerful card even going 1st, don't get me wrong) and even maxing out the going 2nd cards in the side deck, including ones such as Evenly Matched, the 3-off Raigeki, a lone Cosmic Cyclone and Red Reboot.

The deck lacks real consistency, as most of the time the Danger! engine has a RNG component that you sometimes can't play around (and if it fails, you're done) and it can be combined with other cards instead of the ones I chose, such as the Golden Castle of Stromberg package (which not only helps with battle protection and banishing, but also has a LVL8 Special Summon from the deck at the cost of your Normal Summon, and both a MST with legs and field searcher), the full-on banishing cards (adding specifically Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Dim Fissure and the like) and many other variants that I'm still needing to test in order to make sure they still work as they did before.

Any, I mean, ANY change you make to the deck, please, comment it (if possible), so I can test it myself and maybe improve the deck all together."

If you don't have enough UR shards, you can just bring (2) Traptrix Sera, (1) Traptrix Rafflesia, at least 1 major damager dealer like Borrelsword Dragon or Number 39 Utopia + Number S39 Utopia Lightning.

You can also skip Nibiru and Harpie's Feather Duster (substitute it with SR tornado).

Don't forget to fill in Extra deck to the max with any filler card if possible for you to activate Pot of Prosperity.

Bringing additional Floogate Trap Hole sometimes is good if you accidentally pull it during the first turn. You need it to be in deck for Rafflesia to always use it at least once."

The end board should be I:P Masquerena with your Evil Twins setup. If you summoned your Parallel eXceeds, you may also end with Number 41 on the field.

&nbsp;

If going second:

Depending on what your opponent does, respond accordingly with your hand traps.

Usually, you want to go with your usual Evil Twins setup to pick apart your opponent's board.

Use Underworld Goddess of the Closed World to get rid of problematic monsters.

If the board allows you to, you can go for a 4-material Zeus with Sky Cavalry Centaurea and Downerd Magician.

&nbsp;

Overall, the deck feels better going second as it allows for more versatility. The deck is also packed with hand traps due to the archetype's small core engine."

Good enough to get into Plat, but not quite good enough to make it to the higher levels.","Do you want a deck with turns that don't take 40 years? Do you want a deck with combos that don't require 13 steps? Do you want a deck with both cute girls and dragons? Do you want easy wins and to rise to plat 1? Well for that last part you may want to look elsewhere, but for the rest Dragonmaids are the deck for you. The basic plan with this deck is to adapt to going first or second, either getting out Sheou turn one if possible and if not hopefully hieratic and maybe a Dragonmaid Tidying. If going second there's enough hand traps/ board clear to hopefully disrupt your opponets turn enough that they can't respond to your Dragonmaids. Feel free to shift the Maxx C/Ash/Infinites out for your personal favorite field traps/board control, I've just found this combo best handles all but the top 4 decks. Parlor and chamber are the most crucial as they can either get you your fusion spell or put the last monster you need in the graveyard, or shift a tidying in there for a handy special summon. The biggest thing I can recommend is to usually wait as long as possible before activating Sheou's negate. While it is a very handy omni-destruction negate it is a hard once per turn. So even if you manage to trick out another Sheou (which is possible) it won't have its negate until next turn. Its also definitely worth getting either Sheou or House out in Main phase 2 as their effects activate during you opponent's standby phase as well as yours. And lastly try really hard not to get too gung ho about popping the higher level dragon maids back into your hand and putting the low level ones on the field, as if your opponent manages to clear the board before the battle phase you are stuck with a dead hand.

This is a very fun deck with a cool theme, but one that won't see as much success as the current big meta decks. I've managed to get to Plat 3 with it, and can even occasionally take games off Tri-Brigade, Drytron, and Eldlitch but those are few and far in-between."

&nbsp;

<strong>Reasons to play the deck</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>It's cheap.  Despite the Ultra Rare count seen on this deck, many of those cards are just generic staples (many of which you likely already own) or are cards that can be cut and/or replaced with other similar options.</li>
 	<li>It's untouchable. You can all but guarantee that nothing in this deck (or at least nothing important) will be touched by a new Master Duel banlist should one come out in the near future.</li>
 	<li>It's unpredictable. Yugioh players have somewhat of a reputation for not reading cards, and even many who do will miss things like <strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>'s battle protection. Many of the people you will play against wont have seen much of this deck and wont know how to properly play against it.</li>
</ol>
<b>Card Explanations </b>
<ul>
 	<li>The Fishes (and <strong>Tin Goldfish) </strong>- You will rarely find a hand in this deck that can't make <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen</strong> even through getting hand trapped and many of them can also throw out an additional rank 4, usually being your choice of <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> (which actually benefits nicely from it's attack boosting effect) or <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> into <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>.  <strong>Right-hand Shark</strong>'s battle protecting will usually either force your opponent to destroy Kragen by a card effect netting you more advantage or will help you survive to OTK your opponent on the crack back. The several two-of's might seem odd but you rarely want or need to see multiples and it's great in combination with <strong>White Mirror.</strong></li>
 	<li>The Staples - Play what you have. A huge advantage in playing this deck is that it can comfortably go first when you win the die roll but has plenty of room to play versatile hand traps and ""going second"" staples. <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> into <strong>Mudragon of the Swamp</strong> has extra synergy in this deck since he happens to be a water. <strong>Lava Golem</strong> might seem like a weird include, but many of your hands don't require your normal summon and this deck often steals games by burning your opponent to death. It's also a super rare. If you already have <strong>Forbidden Droplets, </strong><strong>Dark Ruler No More, </strong>or <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, feel free to experiment with those instead.</li>
 	<li>The Extra Deck - The only cards you absolutely need here to play the deck is <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen </strong>and <strong>Stealth Kragen Spawn</strong>, with close runner-ups being <strong>Abyss Dweller </strong>with <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> with <strong>Toadally Awesome. </strong>The Floating from your Kragen's easily help you go into <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future </strong>into <strong>Number F0:Utopic Draco Future. </strong><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zues - Sky Thunder </strong>can even by cheesed out by crashing a Kragen or something else protected by <strong>Right-Hand Shark </strong>into an opponents monster and then overlaying in Main Phase 2. If you have any staple rank 4's like <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double </strong>or <strong>Tornado Dragon</strong>, feel free to run them, but remember that some of your shark engine will lock you into water's for the turn.</li>
 	<li>Gozen Match - <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen </strong>turns all monsters your opponent controls into Water's, so Gozen can lock them out of the game. Very few decks are playing any Water's at all. Even without Kragen, it's a pretty solid floodgate on it's own right and basically doesn't effect you. It's also pretty hilarious giving your opponent a <strong>Lava Golem</strong> going second then flipping Gozen on them on their turn.</li>
</ul>
As with many decks, feel free to mess around with the ratio's and some spicy techs like <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>, <strong>Xyz Remora</strong>, or <strong>Number 71: Rebarian Shark</strong>. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding the deck."

I only used a maximum of two copies for staples since I have to balance between survival and potential bricking.

If you're going first, you could go into <strong>Firewall Dragon </strong><strong>Darkfluid</strong> with at least two counters and protection (<strong>Gatchiri</strong> or <strong>Light Dragon</strong>). If you have a good hand, you could send <strong>Water Leviathan</strong> into the GY instead of <strong>Gatchiri</strong> with the <strong>Bururu</strong> effect, or use <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> to bring out <strong>Earth Golem </strong>as Link material to provide more counters. Along with handtraps and/or quick-play spells, you could shut down many decks provided that they don't have <strong>Lava Golem</strong> or <strong>Kaiju</strong>.

My past iteration used <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong> + <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Darkfluid</strong>. However, I was traumatized by <strong>Tri-Brigade Lyrilusc</strong> in the ladder (damn you <strong>Shuraig </strong>and <strong>Draco Future</strong>), so I opted for another boss monster. <strong>Arrival</strong> won't cut it since it is vulnerable to decks that can easily bring out beatsticks like <strong>Utopia </strong>and even <strong>Kaiju </strong>(it is expensive to bring out that you can't afford to lose it).

If you're going second, you could try to circumvent their defenses to bring out <strong>Splash Mage</strong> + <strong>Update Jammer</strong> into <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>. You can use <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> instead of <strong>Splash Mage</strong> at your own risk, but keep in mind that <em>4300*2</em> can win you the game as much as <em>5300*2</em>. Although, if you need more ammunition for <strong>Accesscode</strong>, you could go for <strong>Transcode.</strong>

You need to be careful about the placement of your monsters, especially for <strong>Dark Templar</strong> and <strong>Dark Infant</strong>. Ideally, <strong>Dark Templar</strong> must be in the right EMZ with <strong>Dark Infant</strong> summoned in the leftmost link arrow. The left side of your <strong>Dark Infant</strong> must also be empty since it will move to that zone after chaining with <strong>Dark Templar</strong> in order to make way for the special summoned monsters from the GY.

Using the effects of <strong>Dark Templar</strong> and <strong>Dark Infant</strong>, you can special summon 3 monsters from your GY. It is recommended that you choose <strong>Bururu</strong> + <strong>Pikari </strong>(don't use effect yet since it is negated) + 1 (preferably <strong>Doyon</strong>). Synchro Summon <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> (use this as material for <strong>Darkfluid</strong> since this is very useful in dealing with most invincible monsters even when it is in your GY) using <strong>Bururu</strong> and <strong>Pikari</strong>. <strong>Pikari</strong> will then come back to the field via <strong>Bururu</strong>'s effect. If needed, you can use <strong>Pikari</strong>'s effect to change the level of the other monster to 4 (unnecessary if you have <strong>Doyon</strong>), then Xyz Summon <strong>Light Dragon</strong>. Use <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> to Fusion Summon <strong>Earth Golem</strong> using <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (don't expose a 500 ATK Link monster in the open) and another monster.

Note: In another iteration, I would've brought out <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> and <strong>Dark Templar</strong> + <strong>Dark Infant</strong> into <strong>Avramax</strong>, but it is vulnerable to many plays without the means to counter.

The most common sequence is <strong>Dark Infant</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Cyberse Wicckid</strong> (search out <strong>Bururu</strong>, but skip this if you already have it) &gt;&gt; <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (don't use its effect if you plan to go into <strong>Transcode</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (skip this if you used <strong>Kaiju</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong>. There are many routes and detours to the combo, however, going into <strong>Dark Templar</strong> while having a monster that can be summoned and <strong>Dark Infant</strong> in your Extra Deck is the most ideal scenario. One thing to note is that you are expected to utilize <strong>Achichi</strong>, <strong>Pikari</strong>, <strong>Bururu</strong>, and <strong>Doyon</strong>. <strong>Doshin</strong> and <strong>Hiyari</strong> are just luxury monsters that can extend your combo or help you in a pinch.

If you find yourself in tough spots, don't ignore the other @Ignister monsters since they have very useful effects.

Use <strong>Fire Phoenix</strong> when you don't have enough cards to continue the combo, since it can float and has a monster destruction effect (during the battle phase, banish <strong>Achichi</strong> from GY if necessary).

Use <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> to clean backrow as well as provide a ""revenge"" mechanism to your board (even in the GY).

Use <strong>Light Dragon</strong> to clean monster zone and resurrect a link monster as soon as you deal battle damage with other Cyberse monsters (works in the battle phase).

Use <strong>Water Leviathan</strong> to reduce a monster's attack to 0 while returning all your link monsters from the GY to the Extra Deck (the other effect doesn't work against most decks since only monsters with 2300 ATK or less are returned to the hand).

<strong>Earth Golem</strong> is usually just fodder for <strong>Darkfluid</strong> but it could still be useful in some scenarios.

The best thing about them is that you can directly resurrect them with <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong> and <strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, or return them to the hand with <strong>Doyon</strong> (you can also retrieve related spells with <strong>Doyon</strong>'s effect in the GY). However, if you plan to make use of <strong>Dark Templar</strong> from the GY, don't resurrect it since it can't be placed in the EMZ this way, instead use <strong>Doyon</strong>, <strong>Water Leviathan</strong>, or <strong>Doshin</strong> (if <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> is still in the deck).

If you used <strong>Kaiju</strong>, don't go into <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> since it won't activate its effect and you'll end up wasting your combo potential.

You can allow you opponent to setup their boards if you want then disrupt it with Evenly Matched during your turn. If going first, try to setup Evenly Matched, Impermanence, Widow Anchors or Shark Cannon.

Kaiju is for dismantling immovable bricks in opponents board (Ultimateness, Chaos MAX Dragon, etc.)

Deck is standard Sky Striker combos. Search ""Sky Striker"" Spell Cards using Shizuku. Recycle ""Engage"" using Kagari. Recycle Kagari using ""Herald Base"". Hayate for chipping/setting up graveyard.

I'm shedding the Fusionist persona for a bit because I gotta admit to all y'all guys, my mental state have been spiraling out of control ever since I've played the OCG format again through Master Duel, no joke. I mean, I might be insane because, imagine not enjoying a best of one OCG format with <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> being legal and Drytron is at full power. I must really be stupid at Konami's eyes because, what do I know about game balance. If it brings money, it should be a perfectly healthy card, am I right? But I digress. Anyway, here's presenting the embodiment of my descent into the Joker arc, Eldlich Guru.

It's just such a shame that <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> is banned, I would have loved to commit war crimes in this dog shit ass format. This is pretty much just a standard Eldlich and Guru list, mashed together with the addition of some hand traps and floodgates including the staple <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, and <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric"">Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric</a> because for some reason, <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> is legal, I'd hate to be that guy, but might as well abuse it.

As per usual, the cards on the side will be those that can be nice to have. I'm sorry if there's not much in-depth discussion with this one with in terms of the deck choices because, I'm just really enervated, and I'd rather keep it short and simple, because there's really not much else to say but ""all it takes is one bad format"". Feel free to ask anything down in the comments, though. I'll answer them as soon as I can.

$20-25 Side deck","<em>It's first or nothing</em>

With no Dimension Shifter, this deck will absolutely suck going second. Though you will still have some options available to you.

For monster heavy boards, Book of Moon and Forbidden Chalice work great as single monster negates.

Effect Veiler is a nice cheap handtrap that can still be impactful in stopping some plays, such as hitting a Rusty Bardiche to stop them from setting up Fog Blade.

While you can always cut Harpie's Feather Storm cause it is a bit costly, it is still a great turn ender that requires very little set up.

Side deck is mostly just suggestions. Backrow tends to be difficult to deal with so you run the cosmic + duster package. Anti-Spell + Dark Simorgh shuts down spells entirely. D. D. Crow works great against decks such as Eldlich and Sky Striker and is searchable through Robina. Dimension Barrier works great in hindering Swordsoul or Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika

You can always interchange these cards with board breakers such as Raigeki or Dark Hole. Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched would be great cards here, but they're incredibly expensive."

Then Special Summon Puddingcess from Deck or Hand. Xyz Summon Glassoufle in Defense Position. Activate Glassoufle effect, sending Petingcessoeur to the GY and targeting anyone. Xyz Summon Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode using Glassoufle. Activate A-la-Mode effect to send Petingcessoeur back to the deck (if Chateau is on the field, don't put it in hand). A-la-Mode triggers and activate it detaching Glassoufle.

From here we have a few options. If Anjelly wasn't used to find Petingcessoeur yet, it can be used to find the follow up cards. Otherwise, choose Hootcake with A-la-Mode effect and onto the field. Banish Glassoufle for Hootcake's effect and Special Summon Messengelato. With Messengelato we can find the 3 main spell cards in the Madolche archetype:
<ul>
 	<li>Salon: Any Madolche that returns from Field or GY to Hand or Deck allows to search a Madolche Spell/Trap and set it directly to the Field, therefore, it's another way to search the main Spell cards. It also allows a second Normal Summon if one is a Madolche monster, good to use level 4 monster from hand in case there aren't enough on the field to Xyz.</li>
 	<li>Ticket: Any Madolche that returns from Field or GY to Hand or Deck allows to search a Madolche monster to the Hand. If a Fairy Madolche is on the Field, it Special Summons it. Anjelly, Petingcessoeur, Puddingcess, Glassoufle, Tiaramisu and A-la-Mode are all Fairies allowing to Special Summon Messengelato when a Beast type is on the field to find any Madolche Spell/Trap.</li>
 	<li>Chateau: Besides from the obvious 500 ATK/DEF bonus to any Madolche monster, this spell allows to return any Madolches in GY to Deck, triggering effects like Ticket, Salon and A-la-Mode.</li>
</ul>
Usually, I go Chateau, Salon, Ticket. Bringing Chateau with Messengelato allows to return Anjelly in GY to Deck, triggering A-la-Mode again, detaching Puddingcess to find another Messengelato. With the second one find Salon if you plan on Xyz Summoning Tiaramisu to return things to the opponent's deck for this will trigger Salon and give you access to a Promenade as a protection. If you don't plan or don't have more ways to trigger Madolche's return ability, search Promenade as the protection it gives is imperative if you don't finish the game that turn.

As it can be understood, having some Madolches in the GY is good as it allows effects like Promenade, Tiaramisu, Lesson and A-la-Mode. One easy way to put monsters on the grave is Link Summoning Fresh Sistart, giving 2 bodies for the effects. Sistart is herself a way to trigger Salon, Ticket or A-la-Mode as it can prevent being destroyed by returning 1 Madolche monster to the Deck.

On other simplier synergies we have Mewfeuille that, when Normal Summoned, Special Summons Messengelato from Hand, searching the Madolche Spells/Traps. Cruffssant can return ANY Madolche card on the field to raise it's level to 4 and gain 300 ATK/DEF, being one of the 2 non-Extra Deck monsters with highest ATK possible (short of Lesson), however careful to not have Sistart pointing to any Madolche as it protects Madolche Spells/Traps even from your own effects (the amount of times I saw myself obligated to return a monster are too many). Lesson serves as a finisher in case you need that extra 800 ATK/DEF to go over your opponent's defenses or another way to return Madolches to the Deck.

Regarding non-Madolche cards, Impermanence is a handtrap for turn 1 effects, Called by the Grave stops other handtraps and Twin Twisters destroys Spells/Traps for the price of putting a Madolche in the GY from Hand. Card of Fate is a personal fan card that may or may not give you Petingcessoeur. Abyss Dweller is a GY hate card, Bagooska is a total lockdown for 2 turns, but I play it cause it looks cute, Phoenix is an easy Spell/Trap removal and Almiraj is protection against removal."

Did you ever, at least once in your life, wished to be able to beat the everliving shit out of your opponent? Well, sadly we can't because that'd be classified as Assault but hey, I've got an alternative that can be just as good as that. Presenting, Powerload Ogre Turbo.

<strong>Part I: The game plan.</strong>

<span>It's simple. Going 1st, you either make two <a data-name=""Gouki the Powerload Ogre"">Gouki the Powerload Ogre</a>s or one of it and a <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> protected with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, or if you drew the nuts, two Gouki the Powerload Ogre AND a Masquerena protected Avramax. Going 2nd, you pray that you're able to draw either <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> or <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a> + another name and proceed as usual. No, we're not using <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Nights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Nights</a> here because the bricks just aren't worth it, but we're using the Codebreaker package just because it's a generic Link climbing tool for Warrior decks. All gas, no brakes. The only reason why I run <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> in this build instead of <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> is because the only interaction we have with our opponent is the Battle Phase.</span>

<strong>Part II: The hand traps (I guess).</strong>

<span>The only hand trap you need here is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, really. I only chose <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> because fuck Drytrons, and I deliberately did not craft <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> out of spite to the OCG ban list, and the fact that MD is using that dog shit format is enough proof to me that Konami never learned from their mistakes in the past format but I digress. Basically this could be any staple you want. If you want to play <a data-name=""Photon Thrasher"">Photon Thrasher</a> as a starter as well, fuck it, it's a free Special Summon and a Warrior on board.</span>

<strong>Part III: The staples</strong>

<span>If you want to use a consistency card, either <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> (though counterproductive to the game plan which is OTKing) or <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> (which is also kinda counterproductive since it halves the damage you deal during the turn you use it) could be nice. <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> is bad because you do not have control over which cards you're gonna banish, and there will be games where you need most if not all of your Extra Deck cards. The draw 3 from <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> could be good, if not only because it just straight up defeats the purpose of your deck by not making you deal damage when it is used. You know what else is funny about this deck? Your <a data-name=""Gouki the Powerload Ogre"">Gouki the Powerload Ogre</a>s can comfortably sit under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, so if you wanna run that as well, go for it.</span>

Overall, this deck doesn't really need to ""have"" the Masquerena + Avramax package, it's just an additional towers boss monster that I thought would be nice to have since it's not really that hard to make in this deck, so the only mandatory UR in this deck is the triple copies of Gouki Re-Match. It's a pretty straightforward Link climbing deck, it can be just as budget or expensive as you want depending on whether you wanna run <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> with at least 1 copy of <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> as a target or not, it's totally up to you."

But will you be the choosen one ?,"Hy there...

Here is my decklist of a pure Mekk-knight deck. For the few people who never seen this archetype, this deck where released in 2018 and the gimmick of mekk-knight is to play with both player's collomn.

In fact, most of them have the effect that let you summon himself from hand as long as there is two cards on the same collomn on the field and you special summon the mekk-knight on this collomn, but you can only speciel summon one copy of each name per turn.

First of all, mekk-knight is meant to mostly goes second, because their sommun doesn't trigger negates, which is nice to break boards, on top of their high Atk and Def point, and their easy summon condition when going second, plus they are super consistent and fastly swarm the board with high stats monster.

This is the reason why I don't play any hand-trap on main except nibiru, because every hadtrap won't be effective 100% of the time while board breaker on going second will be pulled of more often. Plus, our format is mostly going first deck, so playing a going second deck gives an insane advatage because the result of the coin flip will basically never matter as you will go second 90% of the time. Plus, a nibiru on main can be super effective as some deck won't be expecting him on game one.

I play gameciel as a way to settup collomn for ""blue sky"" who can search from one to three mekk from your deck to your hand, and if this resolves, you will certainly otk your opponent.

Girsu is obviously a three of because it is a one-card iblee, which can setup your following up and your collomns easely. On top, I play corruptor Iblee because she will summon on the opponen't side of the field, so great for ""blue sky"" and enabe your opponen't for playing nibiru at all, and might shut down a lot of meta deck, mostly tri-brigade and swordsoul, who will struggles getting rid of her and not focuses on your board. But becareful of anaconda verte predaplant, you might end of giving them a free access to dragoon or DPE (or battle buttler for prank-kids).

This deck is really good and have a lot of good matchups against meta decks, one of the easiest one is Sky Striker, mostly thanks to your mekk-knights being able to swarm the field, and also some card are a huge counter to them, just like iblee, gameciel world legacy's whispers, a trap that negate spells on field that is on the same collomn of a mekk-knight (this is not a trigger effet and can even prevent any dodging).

To be honest, there is no budget option for pot of prosperity, this card is unfortunately mandatory, especially since pot of desire, the only card that where not bad enought to see a little bit played, but now, prosperity is a must-play.

I play gameciel because the bird lock isn't releavant anymore, since simogh got hit, and I don't see any deck running a barrier statue to normal nummon and pass... I would also recommand you to change the evenly matched for lightning storm if you can afford it, but I can't so I have to play some ""budget"" option instead, that doesn't really synergise with the deck and make you loose your deck advantage by making you loose your battle phase.

I know there is a lot of people who want to play ""World Legacy World Armor"" and ""World Legacy succession"", but I found out thatthe WLWA combo is like putting all your eggs on the same basket, and I prefer keeping more board presence to be able to control my opponent easier. Also, by playing the deck a lot, I've found out that succession is an amazing card but isn't needed on mekk-knight, because usually, you will rapidly win or rapidly loose, and I have never used this card. This is the reason why I play a one-of called by, who can prevent an ash on Blue or, more deadly, A droll and lock bird.

For the side deck, there is a lot of heavy backrow trategy, so I had to play tree of twin twister on top of the two cyclone to get rid of the skill drain and ice dragon's prison to banish the two Eldlich, which means game for us. Also, putting a contact ""C"" might proove fatal against sky striker or prank-kids and swordsoul and many other decks. Lancea is great because it make passes turn any flowandereese deck and handicaps phantom knight (in the condition that they haven't they adventurer negate). Red reboot is just another backrow-hate.

This deck might seems like nothing but from now, if you still play two cards on the same collomn, karma will send you a mekk-knight deck and you will learn why you have to NEVER play two cards on the same collomn.

A pretty fun deck with a lot of potential, each duel is for me like a boss fight, where I have to give everything I have to break the opponen't board and setup a little bit of control, who can prove fatal if they don't have enough cards to come bach.

Traptrix is an archetype that build itself upon the normal ""Hole"" trap cards, cards that somehow negate and/or destroy monsters when they're summoned or their effects are used. We're mixing it with the splashable Eldlich archetype, which you should be very familiar with right now if you know ANYTHING about what's going on in YuGiOh right now, and if you don't, I recommend you read a few of their cards to see what kind of grind game they are capable of.

As stated, I combined 2 trap decks to make this abomination of a control deck, using cards like Void Trap Hole, Floodgate Trap Hole, and Network Trap Hole to keep your opponent off of their main starter monsters. Void's activation requirement is your opponent special summoning a monster with at least 2000 ATK. This can work if your opponent summons other monsters and with lower ATK values. You get to negate the effect of any of the summoned monsters with 2000+ ATK and pop it. Floodgate sets a summoned monster to face-down defense position and it can't change its battle positions by any means. Big thing to note with this Trap Hole: it works when your opponent summons multiple monsters and it'll set ALL of them face-down. That's nuts. Network banishes monsters special summoned from the main deck or GY face down, and Holes that banish are usually better than others, but the summon HAS to be from the main deck or GY. Gravedigger's negates the effect of a monster from the hand, GY, or banished zone, and burns them for 2000 damage if its successfully negated!

With all these ""Hole"" cards, we might as well run the Traptrix archetype, who's monsters are unaffected Hole traps. We have Myrmeleo, which will add a Hole trap to our hand if normal summoned and pop a spell/trap your opponent controls if special summoned. Dionaea reborns a Traptrix monster on its normal summon and sets a Hole from your GY but if its on the field at the end phase of your next turn, so it will most likely be used! Mantis adds a Traptrix monster on its normal summon and allows you to switch a set spell/trap from your field for one in hand once per turn as a quick effect. Vesiculo allows you to special summon it from hand if we send a set trap from our field to the GY, but Eldlich does this and he's bigger, so you'll do this for one of your Link or Xyz monsters most likely.

We got Eldlich the Golden Lord, the ultimate grind monster that allows you to send a spell/trap you control to the GY to summon him and with protection and a stat boost if summoned with his effect. If we have Eldlich, we might as well run the archetype cards to summon and support him. We have Eldlixer of Scarlet Sanguine which will summon Eldlich from the deck of GY, which is good enough to be ran. Our only 2 spells are 2 copies of Cursed Eldland, which can allow you to pay 800 to search Eldlich or a Golden Land trap from our deck. Note that only zombie-type monsters can attack if you activate this effect. Oh yeah, and if its sent from the field to the GY, you can foolish an Eldlich or Golden Land card. Now we have Huaquero of the Golden Land and Conquistador of the Golden Land. These are our only 2 Golden Land spell/traps and they get to act as trap monsters when activated and gain a bonus effect if Eldlich the Golden Lord is in your control. Huaquero banishes a card from either GY and Conquistador pops a face-up card on the field. They both have the effect to banish themselves from the GY in the end phase to set an Eldlixer from our deck to our field, and our only one is Scarlet Sanguine, so we'd get another Eldlich out anyway.

Now we'll go over our 2 non-archetype cards. Parallel eXceed can special summon itself from our hand if we link summoned, and to a zone it points to. If we manage to summon eXceed with its effect, we can pull a copy of it out of our deck. These eXceed are treated as Level 4, so we can use 'em for Link or Xyz plays, depends on the occassion. Skill Drain is for when we're more on the Eldlich plan than the Traptrix plan. Monster's effects are negated. So fun...

And now the Extra Deck, which you can splash anything in, but these are personal preferences. 2 Rafflesia allows you to send a Hole from deck to GY by removing a material to gain that hole's effect on a quick effect. It also gives your OTHER Traptrix monsters destruction protection from battle and card effects. Allomerus allows you to reborn a plant/insect monster from your GY by removing 2 materials and allows you to gain control of an opponent's monster that was sent to the GY or banished zone by one of your card effects at the cost of 1 material. Number 81 is just in case we have 2 Eldlich laying on the field, so we might as well get a slightly larger guy with protection from card effects. This is a monster you can honestly switch out for a GOOD Rank 4 Xyz like Abyss Dweller of Time Thief Redoer. Zeus is quite obvious why we run him: Make Xyz, use an effect of it, attack, summon big guy that has a quick effect board wipe. 3 Traptrix Sera, our Link 1 Traptrix allows us to special summon a unique Traptrix monster from deck if a normal trap card is activated. It doesn't even have to be a Hole trap or YOUR trap. Free special, woo! And vice-versa, it allows you to set a Hole if another Traptrix' effect is activated. 3 Cularia, and the main reason why I wanted to try Eldlich with this, is our Link 2 monster that allows us to set a Hole trap we just used back on the field instead of sending it to the GY and during your end phase, you get to reborn a Traptrix monster to defense position. The amount of possible recursion this single card provides is bonkers provided it sticks on the field, but its pretty good if you activate a Hole, set it, and use that set card to summon Eldlich. And lastly is our generic Link-climbing cards. Phoenix, Unicorn, Accesscode, and Apollousa, which has a quick effect negate once per chain as long as it has 800 ATK to sacrifice. Oh, and it gains 800 ATK for each of its materials, so you'll usually have 2-4 negates.

That's it for the deck list! Honestly, it seems solid, but you can definitely replace the 3 Skill Drain with a copy of Imperial Order since you only have 2 spell cards and 2 other cards that you prefer, but it DEFINITELY gets shit on with a Harpie's Feather Duster, Lightning Storm, and any monster that has protection from Trap cards. Hopefully y'all learned something from this. Have fun making your opponent wanna rip their own hair out by not allowing them to play the game!

Now as CL1 you revive the Genius Locci with Twin's effect and CL2 you'll use Dryas' effect to gain life points (since you took effect damage from Sowing) and summon Sunvine Healer. Remember to use Healer's effect to gain life points by targeting Dryas. Now you use Dryas and any other monster to go into your first Aromaseraphy Jasmine, but remember to leave one monster in a zone she points to. Now use Jasmine's effect to tribute a monster it points to and summon Aromage Laurel. Now link Laurel and the remaining monster in the main monster zone into your second Jasmine. This triggers Laurel's effect to gain life points, thus triggering the soft once per turn search effect of each Jasmine. From then on, it's up to you to decide which two plant monsters you need. I usually search for Snowdrop and Rose Girl to unbrick my hand with the former and have a monster to replace the one tributed for Snowdrop's effect with the latter.

NOTE: The side deck is not really a side deck and more of something to look at to remain humble while I was building this deck."
