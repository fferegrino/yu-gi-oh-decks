There are 3 copies of Numeron Network and 7 other cards that can grab it (Numeron Wall, Planet Pathfinder, and Terraforming), so you should have it turn one unless your luck is as bad as mine. From there you can either summon the Numeron Gates for an OTK if they have 1 monster in attack mode with 2000+ or if they only have 2 monsters than can defend 2000/4000 ATK, or you can summon one of the larger link monsters.  The Slifer/True Name/Card Advance/Soul Crossing package probably isn't the most efficient, but Soul Crossing is a good late game board breaker that will let you either sit on Slifer while you rebuild or close out the game as people struggle with not being able to drop anything less than 2000 ATK. It's mostly just for fun but there have been times where having Slifer comes in clutch.  Running 3 Numeron Calling is risky and it really makes the Extra deck super tight so this can often become a one trick pony. I'm working on the sideboard to make it more resilient in games 2 and 3."

Instead, we're going to unleash a barrage of Direct Attacks and prevent our opponent from stopping it with violence.</span>  <span>This profile is going to be short and sweet, because there are only 2 types of cards in this deck: Monsters that attack directly, and Traps that prevent or punish your opponent for attacking.</span>  <span>There are slight differences in what each card does, and that's what we'll be covering here.</span>  <span>Let's start with the Monsters. Each monster has some sort of unique effect that pops when it successfully deals direct damage. Reminder that each monster can attack directly. <span>Altergeist Meluseek</span> sends 1 of your opponent's cards to the Graveyard. <span>Drill Barnacle</span> &amp; <span>Raging Flame Sprite</span> each gain 1000 ATK upon successfully dealing damage, with the only difference between the two being their base ATK power. <span>Submarineroid</span> and <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> can switch to DEF position after their attack. <span>Ventdra The Empowered Warrior</span> has an effect, but it has no function with this deck's monster setup, and requires 1 Tribute to Summon.</span>  <span>Now let's cover the backrow. The only Spell in the deck is <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span>, which prevents your opponent from attacking for 3 of their turns. <span>Dimension Wall</span> and <span>Magic Cylinder</span> both function the same; bouncing Battle Damage back at the attacker. Be mindful that <span>Dimension Wall</span> does not negate an attack the same way that <span>Magic Cylinder</span> does, just the damage. Save this one for Direct Attacks if possible, your monster can still be destroyed from Battle even after a successful use of this card. <span>Negate Attack</span> and <span>Waboku</span> are basically the same thing and end the Battle Phase. <span>Waboku</span> technically doesn't end the Battle Phase, but your monsters cannot be destroyed and you take no damage, so it might as well just end the Battle Phase. Lastly, the deadly Forces. Regular ol' <span>Mirror Force</span>, <span>Quaking Mirror Force</span>, and <span>Storming Mirror Force</span> all punish your opponent's attack position monsters in a different way. Mirror destroys them, Quaking flips them face down and locks them there, and Storming sends them back to the hand. While we're still talking about the back row, there's one more trick you can do. <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> is a <span>Pendulum Monster</span> and can be set in the <span>Pendulum Zone</span>, activating the effect of sending the top card of your opponent's deck to the Graveyard when Battle Damage is inflicted to your opponent. This can occur once per turn. Placing <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> in the <span>Pendulum Zone</span> is the recommended way to use this monster.</span>  <span>Oh yeah, you have 2 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> to deal with a couple of things your opponent may or may not do. Use them wisely.</span>  <span>Although this deck is extremely annoying and generally sucks the fun out of dueling, it is not invincible by any means. Blocking Direct Attacks and effect destruction are this decks worst nightmare, as there is no Graveyard support for this setup. I haven't actually played this deck in real life yet, as of now it exists in the Legacy Of The Duelist video games and is used when facing an opponent who is as aggravating as this deck is. If you are a troll however, you might have some fun with this one, it's quite ridiculous my friend.</span>  <span>Feel free to share any ideas or strategies you may have and I'll look into them.</span>"

Do you like gameplays with a lot of hand traps? Soâ¦ have you a disease to be cursed by your friends? </span><span><b>You came to the right place!!!Â </b></span>  <span>Â </span> <span>I present to you all my Anti-meta Magical musketeers!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>Some history</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Back in 2017, </span><i><span>Spirit warriors </span></i><span>Â was announced with three new archetypes and everyone went nuts with these cards, especially withÂ  Magical musketeers. Some, yet, were considering that it would be the next tier 0, in pair with Zoodiac or Spyral because of the power of these cards. However the time has passed and the ânewâ tier 0 never saw a competitive success in any YCS or UDS until the release of Battle of legends: Hero revenge in 2019, that gives birth to link-1 monsterÂ  âMagical musketeer Maxâ, a +5 card advantage with the right set up. After that release, Magical musketeer becomes aÂ  serious contender on the rogue landscape, acting like a true anti-meta deck in pair with Guru control orÂ  Zombies.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>How it works?</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>âMagical musketeerâ is a series of light fiend monsters that works with columns: if a spell/trap card is activated in the same column of that monster, it can activate its own effect. But its primary effect is to enable (in an inherent effect) the ability to use any âMagical musketâ from your hand at any time, at any turn regards that are a spell ou a trap card.</span>  <span>It is so simple but this fact transforms this deck into a hand trap deck powerhouse, where your opponent will never know what to expect as long as your hand maintains itself full of cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>How to play?</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is primarily a control deck that has the first object to break your opponent's tempo, with surgical interaction that shuts down his/her play completely. For a first turn you have to normal summon a Magical musketeer monster, ideal </span><b>Magical musketeer Caspar</b><span> or </span><b>Magical musketeer Starfire, </b><span>that can bring a Spell/trap card or summon another </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>wherever you want, respectively. If you are facing a Pendulum deck, for example, you can summon it on the edge to capitalize by the active effect of opponent scales or summon on the extra monster zoneÂ  to catch any unaware duelist.Â Â </span>  <span>If you didnâtÂ  draw any of the </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>said above, no worries my reader cause </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave </b><span>Â is another great option to summon, It provides a good effectÂ  draw by discardingÂ  </span><b>Magical musket </b><span>card. This can ultimately fix your hand or draw any extender, likeÂ  </span><b>Pot of Desires </b><span>Â or </span><b>Ties ofÂ  Brethren </b><span>Â helping with even more draws orÂ  with the swarmablity of the deck.Â Â </span>  <b>Ties ofÂ  Brethren </b><span>is an interesting card in this cek because you can go in so many lines of play . For example you have draw just one </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave, </b><span>with </span><b>Ties ofÂ  Brethren </b><span>Â you can summon </span><b>Magical musketeer Doc </b><span>and</span><b> Magical musketeer Caspar</b><span>, and even draw 2 card by the effect of </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave, </b><span>Â goingÂ  for the end of the turn with a </span><b>Â Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow </b><span>Â for some negate in the next turn. The same goes toÂ  a level 4 </span><b>Magical musketeer, </b><span>ending with </span><b>Bagooska </b><span>.</span>  <span>Â In case you start a second turn, fear not my reader, I got your back. I present to you </span><b>Magical musketeer MAX, </b><span>a link-1 </span><b>Â </b><span>Â this card has an effect that you can summon </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>monster up the number of spell/trap card that your opponent control OR and to your hand </span><b>Magical musket </b><span>spell/trap cards upÂ  the number of monster that your opponent controls. You can bait, for example anÂ  </span><b>Ash Blossom </b><span>Â with </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave </b><span>or </span><b>Magical musketeer Caspar </b><span>Â and go after that on </span><b>Magical musketeer Max </b><span>and nail it!</span>  <span>And what will we add? The powerful and destructive firearms in Yu-gi-oh! card game. The trap card </span><b>Magical musket - desperado </b><span>Â pops any card face up on the field, a raigeki break from your hand. </span><b>Magical musket - Cross-Domination </b><span>Â is your</span><b>Â  Effect veiler </b><span>Â that negates any monster effect and makes its atk 0. </span><b>Magical musket - Dancing needles </b><span>Â is a D. D. Crow in anabolic, awesome to deal with a problematic GY. </span><b>Magical musket - Last Standing </b><span>is our solemn Judgement, negatingÂ  any spell/trap on site. </span><b>Magical musket - Crooked Cro </b><span>can put even more bodies on the field (even monsters like </span><b>Magical musketeer Mastermind Zakiel) </b><span>and shut down a specificÂ  main monster zone of your opponent. </span><b>Magical musket - Fiendish deal </b><span>Â and </span><b>Magical musket - Steady hand </b><span>Â are for specific situations, protection or bait an interaction.</span>  <b>Honest </b><span>works well with this deck asÂ  well as </span><b>Solemn Judgement. </b><span>Â </span><b>Ash blossom </b><span>Â and </span><b>Ghost belle </b><span>Â is the go choice in this deck too.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>Spice techs</b></span>  <b></b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous: </b><span>Steal any light monster from you opponent GY ( like an Eldlich), will make him/her curse you in the language of angels.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Akashic Magician: </b><span>my favorite link monster, bounce anything on site.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Topologic Zeroboros + I:p Masquerena: </b><span>a devilish prank hard to deal with, specially in a prank-kids mash up</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Number 39: Utopia Double: </b><span>Otk enable.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Side deck: Tri-brigade and Drytron full hate turbo mode.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><b>There is a downside?</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Unfortunately there is a great flaw in this deck: Our </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>monsters are not that biffier. Take for instance </span><b>Magical musketeer Wild, </b><span>our least useful main deck monster, he has 1700 ATK and he is the most powerful monster alongside </span><b>Magical musketeer Mastermind Zekiel, t</b><span>hat are not so easily to put on the field because require tribute a monster or a</span><b> Magical musket - Crooked Crow. </b><span>Monsters that have 2500 atk or higher are difficult to deal with this deck , and untargetable likeÂ  Red-eyesÂ  Dragoon manâ¦ are almost impossible to destroy, because you canât use cards like </span><b><a data-name=""Desperado"">Desperado</a></b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Cross-domination"">Cross-domination</a>, </b><span>and </span><b>honest </b><span>can be easily negated.Â </span>  <span>Another Great flaw is the firearms itself.Â  </span><b><a data-name=""Desperado"">Desperado</a>, <a data-name=""Cross-domination"">Cross-domination</a>, <a data-name=""last stand"">last stand</a> </b><span>and alikes can only be activated if you have a </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>monster on the field, if you have any this card becomes another brick on the wall, doing nothing for the rest of the game cause a lost game for example.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>Conclusion</b></span>  <b>AndÂ  so </b><span>after that journey, you, my reader, have the opportunity and the rights to pick some </span><b>Magical musket </b><span>Â and go to battle, annoying anyone in your local area and become the new king of the anti-meta game (untilÂ  Phoenix Enforcer arrives on tcg, lol). I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy writing this guide and any doubt, tip , or criticism just comment here^^.</span>"

Without it, the deck has trouble defending its niche, which is the power of Inferoble Emperor Charles. Otherwise you're just any combo deck, ending on a board full of interactions using your whole extra deck. Still, I like Combo decks. And the Infernoble Engine seems pretty strong TBH, 1 Isolde is a reasonable combo, and you have the extenders and the searchers to make it into an incredible board.  So, why 60 cards? A few reasons. I like the ratios better, assuming you run the far inferior Squeak Knight engine. It leaves space for interaction. And the deck has a lot of ""bricks"" but really soft bricks that you don't mind seeing, as well as lots of small engines it wants to run to do this. Lastly, you have Amazing searching. Between Durendal, Hertiage, Rota, and 2 Power Tool Dragon you have a lot of tools to find the exact starter you need for your situation. That lessens the impact of running more cards.  So, for Starters we have actually a lot of cards. Neo Space Connector is a clear 3 of, summoning Aqua Dolphin from the deck to rip a card out of our opponent's hand. In a spicy last minute decision I'm trying 3 Aqua Dolphin. Here's the rhetoric - this plus an extender is still at minimum Auroradon + Charles + Herald after ripping a card out of our opponent's hand. Additionally, it means they have to burn a hand trap like Effect Veiler on it to protect any other interruptions in their hand and their information, or else immediately lose a card. Lastly, it cannot be Ashed, whereas connector can be. In that sense, since our basic combo is just in through Isolde, simply this plus an extender is actually a better start, especially with Red Layer (since our best combos use all of our zones). One thing I initially missed out on mentioning is that Aqua Dolphin is only a soft once per turn. This means certain hands can lead with Aqua Dolphin, then use Isolde to summon Aqua Dolphin #2 to rip a second card out of the hand. Combined with D.D.R. and Omega you can easily rip 4-5 cards out of your opponent's hand with certain combos. This is super clutch, since it means they have to hand trap Isolde when the real choke point is Halqifibrax. There is still anti-Nibiru play with Gearfried, don't worry about that, but if you don't have Gearfried you really want to maximize your zone usage. We also have 3 Sublimation Knight with 1 Squeak Knight, an alternative 1 card Isolde. I liked the idea of increasing the consistency of the deck while adding a lot of cards, but in turn to keep our ratios high on starters we need to run more. Often Aqua Dolphin itself is a better normal summon IMO, but in a pinch it will help you combo, and combined with Fire Flint Lady the extension makes a free extra Herald on top of things with certain hands, which I like.  The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales is also a starter of sorts, since it too 1 card Isoldes, but it is also the package by which your full combo makes Apollousa as well as Abyss Dweller. 2 of it seems right, since it is such a good starter card in its own right, and because for your big combo you need a copy in your deck, so yeah 2 feels really good philosophically. One thing to note is it special summons itself from the gy when a PK monster is banished from your GY for any reason, so you can use Phoenix Blade to trigger it if you brick with the trap. The trap is also just a viable extender in a lot of starting positions, so it feels sweet actually. We're very weirdly a deck that runs a lot of bricks, but they're like really unbricky bricks that you actually want to see sometimes.  Armageddon Knight and Plaguspreader Zombie are (almost) your last starters. Arma Knight + extender actually feels really good, especially since Isolde searches a useless monster. It also gives you a way to put Coltwing back into your deck from your hand. And it means your combo ends on an extra Auroradon sometimes, not exactly an interruption but something players. The two make Halqifibrax which is good enough as a start in this deck anyways, although obviously inferior to Aqua Dolphin + Extender or many other broken starts. The number of games where I draw these and they're useful is actually surprisingly high, they have the right levels for the plays your deck makes, and one of them is a tuner at just the right level who loves D.D.R. (Dance Dance!) Plus they're good combo extenders coming from some starts.  Okay, so the deck isn't all bricks. We have an Infernoble Knight package. Roland is a relatively free special summon of a Tuner, and at good level for your plays too. It's equip effect is relevant, but it is one of the more important combo extenders, since you use it to make Needlefibre after Apollousa, leading into bigger plays. It is literally the most important extender in the deck, and a lot of the deck is built to search this guy and Renaud out. Renaud is similarly useful, helping make your whole extra deck but Omega with just Isolde + Renaud + Roland, and if you start with Neo Space Connector or Aqua Dolphin you could have ripped a hand trap out of their hand while gaining information. These also, together, start your combos without using your Normal Summon, meaning you can Normal something mid combo, which is pretty sweet in its own right. Ogier you equip to Charles from the deck, but it is technically our last ""starter"" and there are Ogier combos in the deck when you see it, but we have better normals in most hands. You can technically send Durendal off Isolde to summon Renuad, grab Durendal, use Durendal, find Roland to go into Halqifibrax, and it very rarely seems like a good idea, but it isn't really, so don't do it. If you can't set up your Gearfried early set him up late, you basically never want to summon Gearfried unless it is before Nibiru or at the end of your combo.  Deskbot 001 and Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing are here for the Halq / Auroradon combos. The machine package basically lets you make 9 tokens when you combo off fully, and while zone placements matter a lot during your combos having a repeatable way to summon multiple tokens alongside a repeatable tuner to summon whenever you do is pretty sweet. In a pinch I've even Living Fossiled Deskbot, level 1 tuners are just useful. Coltwing is the only ""real"" brick, but A you can shuffle it back into your deck as part of your normal combos, and B there are combo paths where you don't care if you see it even in the rare situations you can't put it back on top of your deck. We're a deck full of bricks you don't mind seeing, very strange list.  Reinforcement of the Army is obligatory. This card is either our best starter or our best extender in any situation, and is great Ash bait too, because of how powerful its effect can be. Heritage of the Chalice is not as good, but it can find all of our most important extenders, including Durendal to find some lesser ones. Durendal is obligatory, and I think you have to run 3. These just find you all your good extenders to start into your combo, and are searchable thanks to Power Tool Dragon, so you really should maximize running 3. D.D.R and Living Fossil are extenders. We need equips in this deck for Isolde, and these cards are decent extenders in their own right, and are searchable if you run them at 3. This means we can make smart choices about which equips we search based on which we ""brick"" with. Yes, my bricks are literally extenders I want to run 3 of. Overdone Burial does sometimes come up in your combos, but is an easy pitch if you're wondering what that third or 4th spell should be. Divine Sword Phoenix Blade is a brick, but you can pitch it during your normal combos to Torn Scales, and even doing that it will save you out on a lot of card disadvantage. Sometimes you have to know when to equip it to Synchro fodder, that's the hardest part of the card. That and remembering to activate its effect every time you want to pitch something.  Gearfried is a good boss monster that protects me from Nibiru and other hand traps early in my combos in most games where I see it, and it the final 6th monster on the board in your ""the nuts"" hands. If we were running fewer cards 1 or 2 would be fine, but I want to occasionally see him. You can pitch him with Ogier and use Renaud to pick him back up sometimes as you start your combos, so keep that in mind. Otherwise it's just this good beatstick with a good negate and a good board breaking ability.  We have a few generic extenders in the mix, to get those ratios up and give us more ways into the combo. Red Layer is searched and send as part of many of your basic combos, but also if you see it you can start your plays with it, without using a normal summon. Fire Flint Lady is better, you occasionally use the second effect, but mostly this just helps start your plays, maybe after Space Connecter gets hand trapped or alongside Aqua Dolphin. You can search Fire Flint Lady with Durendal, which can also be searched by Heritage or Power Tool, provided you're planning ahead with your sends and searches. This does rarely come up.  The rest is interaction. If we're counting on 1 hand trap doing the thing, we'd better run Gamma and Nibiru, the highest impact hand traps in game where they are impactful. After that I'm running Called and TTT, because we're a combo deck with a little hand ripping all the same.  For the extra deck there really wasn't a lot of space. Sometimes you make 2 rank 8s, so you sort of have to run Omega in that last slot, and the other 14 help with your full combo that puts 5-6 boss monsters in your zones with interruption effects and/or floodgate effects. It really is all for that combo, but the deck is built so that even its smaller boards are pretty decent. Expect to see Charles next to another negate after interruptions a lot of the time. The combo is also nice and flexible, since the full combo is so inefficient even makeshift combos often have really good end results, since you can skip some of the more inefficient steps in those situations, depending on the extenders you draw. I think every card in the extra deck is essential.  Sideboard is trash. Solemn Judgement is my go to going first card, even in combo decks. DRNM is my going second card. Cosmic is for trap decks and general backrow. Skull Meister and Droll are pretty good generically right now, and both good against Drytron, so while it's top deck I'm gunning for it, maybe a little too hard.  <strong>Combos</strong>  <strong><em>Basic out of Isolde</em></strong>  Found a better combo.  Make Isolde, add Gearfried  Mill 4, summon Genba  Halq, summon Deskbot 001  Make Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  Summon Deskbot  Make Power Tool #1, guaranteed D.D.R.  Auroradon effect, Tribute itself + Power Tool, summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect, 2 tokens, bring back Deskbot  Make Power Tool #2, guaranteed add Durendal  Make Dracossak in the extra monster zone  Dracossack make 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Synchro Deskbot + token into Balmung  Dracossack 2nd effect, tribute 1 token, destroy Balmung  Balmung effect, bring back Coltwing  Coltwing effect, 2 more tokens, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + 2 tokens, make Shooting Riser, send Red Layer  Shooting Riser + token, make Roland  Roland + Coltwing, make Charles  Banish Balmung to get back Phoenix Blade  D.D.R Summon Balmung  On resolution Charles triggers, pops Balmung  Balmung effect, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Make Herald of the Arc Light  Use Durendal, search Renaud  Summon Renaud, add back D.R.R  Renaud + Coltwing, make Borreload Savage  Banish Roland, add Phoenix Blade  D.D.R Roland, make Omega  End phase effects.  &nbsp;  So your final board is Dracossack for another pop next turn, Charles for ongoing popage, Herald, and Savage, all off of any Isolde, plus Omega for hand looping.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Hand Rip combo</strong></em>  So for this one you need any Isolde + Infernoble Knight Renaud  Isolde, add Red Layer  Isolde, send 4, summon Oliver  Make Halq, summon Deskbot  Make Auroradon, summon 3 token, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + 2 tokens, Power Tool #1,  Power Tool effect, add Living Fossil/D.D.R  Auroradon tributes itself + Power Tool to summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Make Power Tool #2  Power Tool effect, add D.D.R (these are sort of flexible, and often what you add depends on your hand + luck)  Xyz summon Dracossack  Detach 1 material, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + Token make Balmung  Living Fossil, Summon Oliver  Make Shooting Riser in the Extra Monster Zone  Dracossack effect, Tribute itself, destroy Balmung  Balmung effect, summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect summon 2 monsters, summon Deskbot  Shooting Riser + token make Knight Captain Roland  Summon Renaud, add back D.D.R  Roland + Token make Borreload Savage Dragon, equips Auroradon  Renaud + Coltwing (now level 7) summons Omega  Deskbot + token makes Herald of the Arc Light  Omega effect, banish it to loop a card, then D.D.R to rip a second card. If you added D.D.R both times you can hand rip an opponent's hand for 3 cards (after Aqua Dolphin). So yeah, try for D.D.R when possible. However, you can also use your searches for Durendal if you already have 1 D.D.R or Living Fossil.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Anti - Nibiru Combo</strong></em>  This one will vary based on your hands, but essentially you need a Gearfried, a way to get him equipped, + any route into Isolde. This forces you to do a slightly stilted combo using a similar route above. A common start for this is Ogier + Durendal, though there are other ways to set up a Gearfried before Nibiru. You'll typically summon Isolde first, then summon Gearfriend as your 4th summon before using Isolde's second effect. You'll go through the route above, but you're forced to Tribute a token for Auroradon, so you'll have Auroradon in the extra monster zone and can't make Dracossack, so it's up to your extenders from that point in the combo.  Often the better answer, if you see Oliver, is to go for the Apollousa Combo, but Gearfried does enable anti-Nibiru play by itself provided you have the right extenders.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Isolde + Oliver combo</strong></em>  This is where the combos start to get nuts, and this start is where you begin making Apollousa.  Your combo starts the same. Isolde adds Red Layer. This time it sends 3 equips, including Phoenix Blade, to summon Phantom Knights of Torn Scales.  Phoenix Blade effect, banish the warriors that made Isolde to add back to hand.  Torn Scales effect, pitch Phoenix Blade to send Ancient Cloak  Ancient Cloak effect, banish itself, add Silent Boots  Special Summon Silent Boots  Link your 3 monsters into Apollousa with 3 negates (sometimes an extra Red Layers makes 4)  Banish Silent Boots, Chain Torn Scales: Summon Torn Scales and add Shade Brigandine (note - in a pinch you can use Phoenix Blade to banish Silent Boots to still trigger Torn Scales, useful if you see Shade Brigandine or start with it, though you have to be careful about your banishes)  Summon Oliver by pitching Red Layer (note: in some combo sequences you can add back Phoenix Blade at this point to pitch, useful with Overdone Burial, but make sure you have an extra warrior to banish in your GY)  Link Torn Scales and Oliver into Halqifibrax  From here you have Apollousa in the extra monster zone and the start to your Auroradon combos, though this will end with 1 less Deskbot, forcing you to use D.D.R/Living Fossil to finish your combos.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Isolde + Renaud + Oliver (+Gearfried)</strong></em>  This is where you put it all together, using Oliver and Phantom Knights to make Apollousa first and then using Renaud when you Summon Roland to sub in for Deskbot while looping you a D.D.R or Living Fossil to make Abyss Dweller with Shade Brigandine. It ends on Apollo with 3 negates + Herald + Borreload Savage + Charles with Roland in the GY, + Abyss Dweller. If you have Gearfried in your hand you'll have 6 boss monsters including 6 negates, a pop, and 2 floodgates, and while on paper this appears to require the perfect hand, we have so much searching and seeing your equip spells or searchers helps you achieve this result semi-consistently.  The real nuts is opening with Red Layer, Aqua Dolphin then Isolding for Aqua Dolphin, then extending with Oliver to make Needlefibre, then making all your follow-ups with Auroradon in the extra monster zone, hoping to hit enough D.D.R to follow up with 2-3 Omega + Herald + Charles (Roland). Hand loop for 5, omni negate, two pops, Gearfried for follow-ups. Sometimes it'll happen, and in ways that are hard to interrupt even with multiple hand traps. Other games you hope you don't need the hand pressure. But the pressure is real, and 6 Aqua Dolphin really increases it. On occasion I've D.D.R. Aqua Dolphin for extra hand pressure. Soft once per turn. Oops. Also notable is you can, with certain hands, use Isolde to summon Aqua Dolphin then make Roland with Aqua Dolphin and Plaguespreader and go into Halq that way. That's right, Plaguespreader isn't a brick, it is an extra hand loop. Towards the end of your combo, you use Shooting Riser to make Charles with Coltwing while 1 token is still on the field. Pretty sweet. If you need to clear up a token, since Roland is in the GY you can banish him for Phoenix Blade, D.D.R him, make Omega, then immediately Banish. This is how you get 4 card hand loops with full boards of interruption.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Drawing Coltwing Combo</strong></em>  So, what if you have Isolde and you draw Coltwing? You can sometimes put it back into the deck with Plaguespreader, but doing that in your main combo route is awkward to say the least, though it is viable. However, even if you draw Coltwing you can combo off, depending on the extenders you draw and your opponent's plays, so it won't always be necessary to go into the ""gimped"" combo. Pay attention to what you have in your hands before summoning Arma knight - however, sometimes it is necessary.  &nbsp;  Changed the deck slightly. Torn Scales impressed me enough as a starter that we're running 3 of it now, and no Squeak Knight. Also added in more extenders so we can start with Aqua Dolphin normal more often. Lastly, I'm trying out Foolish Burial. Burial itself is an extender in the deck, and a pretty good one. Cut Cross Porter, it was just a brick that never came up.  One more thing to note - just like people underplaying Isolde searching Aqua Dolphin, people are also underplaying leaving 3 Durendal in the deck to guaranteed search 1 with Power Tool. This typically searches Renaud to add a sent or used D.D.R. back to the hand while making the level 1 Tuner extender you need in your combo. Search Aqua Dolphin liberally, consider adding Durendal, and make lots of Omegas. Have fun!"

Metalfoes are a deck that relies on destroying ally cards to gain advantage, while also removing opponent's cards.  Metalfoes want to push the opponent into a war of attrition or a grind game, one that they will easily win due to how many cards they can pop.  Simply place 2 metalfoes in scale, summon bunch of guys, then fuse. The pend monsters effects, if you set a fusion spell with them, you can use it on the same turn, so you always have access to at least one fusion spell. If going second, fuse into Mithrilium, pop a card if you can, then fusion again into Azortless to pop yet another. If Azortless is destroyed, you have access to a pop whenever you destroy an allied card, so don't hesitate to pop Azortless to get that other pop. If going first, just summon Alkahest and set traps plus a parametalfoes fusion to get a strong interrupt plus an opportunity to fizzle a spell if Alkahest is targeted, and a 2500 beatstick during opponent's turn as long as Alkahest is alive. This probably won't come up much, but it's nice to have.  You can play links like Apollousa, or rank 9s like Jormungandr of HeartEarth due to Vanisher. When summoning off of counter, you always want to get a vanisher if possible. Because of this, you should generally not search Vanisher to keep good targets for Counter, and the summoning condition is quite costly nonetheless. I don't recommend Trap Trick because you can't search Combination, and you'll want to keep your copies of Counter. Waking the Dragon can be good if you find yourself losing your backrow too much."

A kingdom of sweets. An enigma to the people that visit this enchanted land. Ruled byaÂ  monarch, the kingdom resembles a landscape made of various confections, with all the edibility that entails. The residents there are even strnagers, resembling plastic dolls or plush toys, thought inquiries into that are usually met with confusion.  The two princesses are the talk of the kingdom. the heiress known as <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Puddingcess</a> lives a charmed life as she attends her royal duties, prepares to inherit the throne, and tries to keep her little sister out trouble. Recent gossip claims that she is enamored with ser <a data-name=""Madolche Chouxvalier"">Chouxvalier</a>, but he seems reluctant to confirm it. Among the nobility lie the royal staff, including the royal teacher <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Glassouffle</a>, the clergywoman <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Sistart</a> and the angel she is in communion with, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Anjelly</a>.  Visitors are often left charmed by the kingdom's delights, thought her political neighbors often suspect something amiss, as if there is a fey air around it. Interestingly, a young child with an expansive doll collection went missing a year before contact with the kingdom as established, and no records tell of the kingdom's existence before that point, furthermore the missing child bore an uncanny resemblance to <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Queen Tiaramisu</a>...""  Well I haven't made a post in a while and I had some decks IRL to adapt to this site's decklist so I'd thought I'd rectify that for once. Be warned thought some aspects of this list are, puns aside, half-baked.  The gameplan of the scrumptious Madolche kingdom seems to emphasize Summoning (mainly from the deck) and their adorable princesses, the eldest of which being needed for certain cards in the archetype to get bonus effects and herself has an Xyz variant that serves as a beater and another way to pull from the deck. The last common ingredient is a reliance on continuous backrow cards. They are predisposed for going second but have tools to weather the storm should they have to go first (of course some of those tools are out of theme and not ones I can apply to the deck yet).  The main playmakers are <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>. Hooty and Angelly here both summon direclty from the deck, as does Petingcessoeur, but in her case that is meant to bring out her big sister, <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> as the kid reduces the level of any monster she summons and otherwise messes up the Rank 4 plays with any other monster. Magileine OTOH is just a searcher, but one with no HOPT.  Another important card is <a data-name=""Madolche Messingelato"">Madolche Messingelato</a> who can fetch a needed spell card if he's special summoned. <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a> is another normal summon that can summon out another Madolche from your hand. Madolche Cruffsant meanwhile is card that bounces a Madolche to grant himself a level and 300 ATK, a little niche TBF but it is another way for Rank 4 plays and helping proc certain cards.  Moving onto the spells we have <a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>, all of which are important to the strategy and play off of each other in interesting ways. Chateau is a field spell that brings every doll in the GY back to the deck to ensure certain effects are live and if any subsequent monsters left there are returned to the deck you have the option of bringing them to the hand instead (and it has a 500 ATK boost to Madolche monsters). This brings us to Ticket which can special summon or search monsters every time Madolche cards are returned to the hand or main deck. Last but not least is Salon, which gives us an extra normal summon (Notable because the archetype does have a few cards that plus on normal summon, two of whcih were already mentioned and of those two at least one isn't HOPT) and also helps to search backrow  &nbsp;  Moving onto the traps. <a data-name=""Madolche Lesson"">Madolche Lesson</a> is a simple 800 ATK boost, decent by the standards of such powerups but the effect itself is mediocre since the focus is away from the battle phase. still it can help close out games considering that Puddingcess's Xyz version can reach 3800 with this and Chateau active. <a data-name=""Madolche Nights"">Madolche Nights</a> serves as a monster negate and with Puddingcess herself out a way to remove a card by returning it to the deck. <a data-name=""Madolchepalooza"">Madolchepalooza</a> is...mostly there for fun, the effect to summon any amount of in theme monsters form your hand is nice but kinda wasteful economy wise given they will all return to the deck at the end and as a trap you can't use thus turn one. <a data-name=""Madolche Promenade"">Madolche Promenade</a> is the deck's best trap yet, negating a mosnter in exchange for bouncing one of your own, while also have an effect that lets you attach a Madolche monster to one of their xyz.  This is a pure build so the only off-theme main deck cards here are 2 Kaiju, and playsets of <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>.  Onto the Extra deck, the off-theme ones were cobbled together from cards I have that weren't in another deck. ranging from the metaish such as <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax</a> Â to some small utility like <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, to the less played such as <a data-name=""Evigishki Merrowgeist"">Evigishki Merrowgeist</a> and <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>. Of course the majority of the ED is dedicated to copies of the 4 in theme monsters. Staring with the OG boss monster, <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>. Tiaramisu is a primarily reason why the deck wants to go second as her effect a powerful piece of removal with a rate quality that moots certain forms of responses and ""cannot be targeted"" effects. For going first we have <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Madolche Fresh Sistart</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a>, which serve to protect your backrow and one of your monsters, respectably. the latter also has a nifty recycling effect that procs when another Madolche goes to the GY, helping to keep your GY clean. The last monster is <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode</a>. Puddingcess here taking on a new dress, 1500 extra ATK and the ability to summon a mosnter from the dekc (provided Puddingcess herself is an overlay unit, this explains Petingcesouer and Prominade's effects)  The side deck here is a more of a concept as I don't have the cards in it IRL (I <em>have</em> most of the cards IRL but they are in other decks ATM). To explain those cards...  Ash, Nibiru, Called, DRNO and Called are staples that need no explanation. As for the more unique pick, lets start with the in-theme cards.  <a data-name=""Madolche Butlerusk"">Madolche Butlerusk</a> is another monster that search a card on Normal summon, however instead of a Madolche cards it is instead a field spell. the catch is that you need another Madolche monster to use it, if you're wondering why this dude wasn't teched in every deck that uses a field spell. He's here more becuase of the fact that I don't currently run Terraforming and Metaverse (despite having a lot of copies of them, I am considering them of course)  <a data-name=""Madolche Tea Break"">Madolche Tea Break</a> is a counterpart to Nights, whereas Nights responds to Monster effects, this card responds to spells, and like Nights,m it also has a Puddingcess reliant bonus effect. In this case popping a card. <a data-name=""Madolche Waltz"">Madolche Waltz</a> is in the side deck concept for some cute Game 3 memes, as it is a burn card that deals 300 damage each time one of your dolls battle, it can also potentially close out games (Puddingcess Chocolat with 3800 ATK plus this means up to 4100 damage), but the changes are minor.  Last card of note is <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. This one helps search your Normal Traps provided you can spare a copy of the one you want to search and lets you activate it the same turn. Naturally if I do have these in the IRL deck the ratios of some of the traps would bump up.  thus ends my Madolche deck profile. I am aware that this is half baked and that other options are available (Traptrix Raflessia+Gravedigger's for starters). It is for that reason that I will appreciate any feed back you have on this deck. Especially where the Extra is concerned."

Also Counting with the water Magistus monster and 2 of the spellbook cards we have 9 chances to send a water monster to the graveyard.  Verte anaconda, Quintet Magician and Magicalized fusion are just a personal preference to make the deck more diverse and funny, but if you want to change something in extra deck, these are the cards to remove.  Ok that's all.  &nbsp;  Any suggestions are welcome.  Sorry for any grammar mistakes."

Dinos are pretty cool too.,"Enjoy my Cimo-esque talk-man card-by-card.  Topped at locals with this one the last 3 out of 4 weeks (Top 8, Top 4, Top 2). Really been liking the way this runs. Intimidating first turn boards with the excellent grind game that Virtual World brings.  &nbsp;  Main Deck:  Virtual World ratios are pretty typical. I've been thinking of cutting Emergency Teleport for something else as its usefulness seldom comes up. I choose not to play the Toutou as it never seemed to come up in testing. I am not playing Desires two Nyannyan, 2 Chuche, and 1 Xuanwu works just fine. I find that even though you can shuffle things back with Nyannyan, I prefer to have everything accessible without the extra steps if you lose it off Desires.  2 Foolish Burial Goods gets Qinglong in GY. Since I don't play Desires, Goods is an additional way to get you to your starters and attempt to bait handtraps.  Destiny HERO - Malicious is an excellent card to get rank 6 plays going. Additionally, this deck sends from hand to GY at least twice in a typical turn (Qinglong, Xuanwu) so drawing it actually feels really good. You can send one with Beatrice as well.  The main spice in this deck is the three-card Dino package of Overtex Qoatlus, Double Evolution Pill, and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. Typically, I would send Qoatlus with Beatrice to search for Pill. Then, after a few Virtual World plays, there will be plenty of non-Dinos in the GY. Just like Mali, drawing Qoatlus feels great as well (send to GY with Qinglong or Xuanwu). This means that I do not necessarily need to make Beatrice (though Beatrice will still send Mali so it usually still a good play). Drawing Pill or UCT certainly isn't the best as drawing them means less cards to work with for your combos. Drawing these, however, does not make my hand unplayable (just might end up with less cards in hand when you pass your turn). UCT is an additional threat on turn 1 for the opponent to deal with. Oftentimes, the opponent will remove the UCT but still be staring down a Shenshen and a Chuche.  Drawing the 1 Foolish Burial also means that I don't necessarily have to make Beatrice.  I chose to play 3 Infinite Impermanence and 1 Effect Veiler over the Gamma package as I do not have good luck with Gamma (I know, not the best reasoning). These slots are pretty flexible so use whatever feels relevant and playable.  Called by the Grave is just a good card. Triple Tactics Talent is another good card. I only play 1 because I hate drawing 2 of them (it's also expensive). Metalfoes Fusion is easy discard fodder that'll net a replacement for that discard. And Upstart Goblin makes this a 39-card deck instead.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen is a really good card. On field Macro Cosmos that keeps coming back after leaving the field. Also, don't forget its effect on your monsters' attack declarations.  Stardust Charge Warrior, Coral Dragon, and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys all net cards from draws. Croc's discard 2 to pop quick effect can also come up sometimes.  Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu is nice removal and another 6 for mid to late game.  Vermillion Dragon Mech seldom comes up but when it does, it is very nice to have (whether you're popping an opponent's card or cycling a Tuner to your hand by popping itself).  Geomathmech Final Sigma is great against backrow decks. It can give Geist a difficult body to remove (Geist is one of my worst matchups).  Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow plays around Nibiru.  Virtual World Shell - Jaja is a Dragoon out and can easily get to Zeus.  Constellar Ptolemy M7 cycles back Virtual World names for follow-up.  Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal is the MVP of this deck. This card can get to UCT plays, Mali plays, and even Banshee/Zombie World plays (check side deck).  Number 39: Utopia Beyond is another way to out troublesome cards like Dragoon and is a great OTK enabler. Pair this with UCT to reduce all of your opponent's monsters to ATK and attack each one with UCT.  Gaia Dragon, The Thunder Charger gets to Zeus. The piercing damage cam also come up from time to time.  Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus Sky Thunder is a good card.  Sometimes there is enough grinding to bring the match to time. Battlecruiser Dianthus will win the game in time.  I do not play Fanfan. If I had the room, I absolutely would :(  &nbsp;  Side Deck:  Lancea and Droll are good cards.  Depending on the opponent's deck, Necroworld Banshee sent by Beatrice (or discarded if Banshee ends up in hand) can be extremely powerful (oh yeah, more floodgates).  Harpie's Feather Duster, Cosmic Cyclone, and Red Reboot are good cards (I hate backrow). Thinking of maybe swapping the 2 Evenly Matched for something else but again, I hate backrow."

Warbler is both,  The first two win conditions are assembled nightingale, and recital starling. <ol>  	<li>If you can lava golem opponents monsters, combo out two starlings(buffing lava golems attack by 600 each) and nightingale, or just buff any of their monsters they summon on the first turn, and use nightingales effect. Your starlings can then swing in and make the opponent take the damage from the combat, while you don't take damage and the starlings survive.</li>  	<li>The other way is to get assembled nightingale out with 2-3 materials, on the opponents turn during standby, pop nightingales effect, and hope they dont have a kaiju. Then on your turn, summon 2 recital starlings, buffing nightingale, and use bird sanctuary to put one of them+their mats onto nightingale and swing a million times. Mystic mine can help with this part of the strategy if the opponent over-extends, since you dont have to clear their board to attack directly.</li> </ol> The next section is more of what to do when going first,  1. using simorgh, linkuriboh, and stormcrest is a good way to gimp a deck that isn't running destruction. My go to vs drytron. If you get it with Linkuriboh, that is two or more turns you shut them down.  2.Â  going into utopic future, then draco, If I don't know what the opponent is doing, I will go into this and pray they dont have a kaiju.  3. This option is the most vulnerable to hand traps, but if you have enough of the combo to do it, can go into a starling, nightingale, 3 mats ensemble robin, If you think the enemy is using wind special summons.  If anyone has any comments or questions, I can answer them. I have a large amount of replays saved on EDO If you think seeing an example play out might be better for you.  &nbsp;"

Negate all targeting. Pierce everything. ,"Hi,  This is a control deck, through negation of targeting effects. The main boss monster is Dark cavalry. He negates any targeting on either your or your opponents field, by discarding a card (multiple tiimes per turn) and does piercing battle damage to monsters in defense position. The Main goal is to get him onto field as fast as possible. It is possible to fusion summon him without polymerisation, through monster effects, which is good as it willÂ  keep a card in your hand for negation.  If you're not getting Dark cavalry out, you're stopping your opponent from achieving their combo through backrow cards such as traps, which can be changed out for traps / spells of your choice or for hand traps as suggested in the side deck.  Through magicalized fusion and necro fusion, you can use your graveyard to further fusion summon.  Thant's pretty much it. Negate any targeting. Pierce your opponent to death.  Still working out best version of deck, so any comments or feedback welcomed. woop."

Dinowrestler Monsters: The archetype is a complete joke, a lot of anime cards with very situational effects depending on whether opponent controls more monsters than you or the opponent does actions for you to generate any advantage, the deck starter only trigger effect when special summon and the best way to bring it by special in turn 1 is with the Iguanodraka and for that the starter has to be in the GY, the field hinders you more than it helps and it's only good in the gy, the fusion is also a joke and it's better use POLY instead because POLY is searchable and also uses materials from Hand, the best monster effects are slow because you only use it in the END Phase, do you want to put a BOSS monster on the field and be BEAT DOWN with it in 2021 konami? Apart from Pankratops and Synchro 8 the deck's interactions aren't that big a deal. Too much restriction for little synergy between the cards.  A lot of wasted potential, I understand that the field only let each player attack with one monster compares to an octagon with 2 fighters, I also understand that they have effects on GY is because as your opponent has to control more monsters than you do for some effects activating so it makes sense you have fewer monsters on the field and also they special summon in the End Phase helps to have only more monsters than the opponent when the advantage effects have already been used. Their being in the GY also feels like a crowd looking at the Octagon above them and trying to help their Dinowrestler when your opponent Special Summons your turn or declares an attack on your monster and Martials that have Battle Hand Trap effects are like your Dinowrestler's team that is battling helping him, it's an interesting theme but it doesn't work after all needing to be merged with the Dino deck to play.  In the end despite what I said if the pure version was efficient enough for you to use the Dinowrestler effects easily and with less restriction and depend less on an opponent's action or the number of monsters he controls, the deck would be enough for the archetype proposal but that's not what happens. The best cards in this game are the ones that you can easily use and automatically generate you advantage and interaction, and this deck lacks that. In closing at least I'll say that despite Link 2's idiotic restriction of only reborning a Dinowrestler monster when used as a Link Material and not a Dinowrestler's Material which would activate its effect when used as Fusion Material it has synergy with Trisbaena to banish the opponent's entire back row. An optimistic thought is in the Dinowrestler Valeonyx card when it quotes Link-3 or higher ""Dinowrestler"" monster which means the archetype has a Link 4 that was never cast but even if it was good it would be necessary to first correct the immense difficulty of this deck to get it putting monsters on the table would need one or two excellent support to fix - that would have to be a pretty absurd effect."
