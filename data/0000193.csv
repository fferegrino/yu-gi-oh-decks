Some combos include using Magician's Restage to summon Magicians' Souls and using Magicians' Souls to send it to the graveyard to draw cards. Magician's Restage also works on Berry Magician Girl. Magician's Restage is also useful in summoning Predaplant Verte Anaconda.  Using Eye of Timaeus, you can summon either Dragoon or Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight. One of my favorite things to do with this deck is using the effect of Kiwi Magician Girl to increase Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight's attack to higher levels to beat over foes, since nothing's more humiliating than losing to Dark Magician Girls in general.  Of course there's always the tried and tested Predaplant Verte Anaconda into Dragoon combo that's in nearly every deck nowadays. There's also the summoning of Divine Arsenal AA Zeus from two level ones including Magicians' Souls or Berry Magician Girl.  This deck also includes Ash Blossom and Solemn Judgement, although these can switched out for any other hand traps or field traps of your liking, these are the ones I went with."

With all of them on the field, your opponent can not: (Attack | Special Summon | Set monsters | activate Spells/Traps ).  In other words, they can do nothing. This far, I could only make out two cards that could threaten this combo: Volcanic Queen and Galaxy Cyclone. Both of those are run very rarely if ever. Normal Kaijus don't work because your opponent cannot special summon. Sphere mode and Lava Golem don't work because you never want to have more than one monster on the field after resolving your combo. And other Spell/Trap removal options don't work because they can't be activated from the field.  &nbsp;  Your core strategy is this:  Summon House Duston/Stygian Security  Run into the enemies monster and special summon as many Dustons as possible to either side of the field. (make sure to give your opponent at least two dustons, except white or house duston).  Activate Mystic Mine and set Anti-Spell fragrance.

But first, since I went through some trouble building the deck due to motives explained below, I changed the rules for the challenge and take a similar approach to some special decklists posted on OCG. That rule being that I know must use, at least, 30 cards on my Main Deck that belong on the original card list of the Structure Deck, where having multiple copies of a card will count. But the 40-card Main deck rule stays.  Now, as for the achetype itself, the Spirit Charmer Structure Deck actually covers 3 sub-archtypes linked together by their playstyle; those being Charmers, Familiar-Possessed and Awakening of the Possessed.  Charmers are a series of Level 3 Spellcaster-Type Flip monsters with 500 Atk/1500 Def with share the effect that if the card is flipped, you can target one monster your opponent controls that shares its attribute and take control of it while the Flip monster remains on the field. This Flip monster also cover all attributes on the game, except DIVINE: Eria for WATER, Hiita for FIRE, Aussa for EARTH, Wynn (not Winda, and no, not that one) for WIND, Lyna for LIGHT and Dharc for DARK.  Familiar-Possessed are a series of Level 4 Spellcaster-Type monsters with 1850 Atk/1500 Def that represent an ""upgraded"" form of all 6 Charmers. All of them can be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck by sending their respective Charmer monster and a face-up monster on your side of the field with the same attribute as that Charmer monster. Also, if summoned by this method, all of them can deal piercing damage. However, Lyna and Dharc have an additional effect: Lyna can add 1 Spellcaster-Type monster with 1500 Def from your Deck to your hand, while Dharc can add 1 Level 3 or 4 LIGHT Spellcaster monster.  Finally, Awakening of the Possessed consists of Level 5 monsters with 2000 Atk/200 Def that can also be Special Summoned from the hand or deck by sending a face-up Spellcaster-type monster and a face-up Level 4 or lower monster with the same attribute as the Level 5 monster, where in this case there isn't a LIGHT or DARK monster. All of them have an effect when summoned by their summoning condition and a floating effect: <ul>  	<li>Rasenryu (WIND): Return a card your opponent controls to the hand, without targeting. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Wind Art - Miyabi"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Nefariouser Archfiend (EARTH): Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from the GY with its effects negated. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Gagigobyte (WATER): Send a random card from your opponent's hand to the GY, then, both players draws 1 card. If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Water Art - Aoi"" from the Deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Greater Inari Fire (FIRE): Burn your opponent equal to the original ATK of 1 monster they control (you can chose the target, but by how the effect is written, it actually doesn't target). If is sent from the field to the GY: Add either a ""Possessed"" Spell/Trap or ""Spiritual Fire Art - Kurenai"" from the Deck to your hand.</li> </ul> For their new support of the Structure Deck (at last, after overexplaining the archtype):  Spirit Charmers is a interesting card. As a Quick-Play Spell, you can discard a card to take 2 cards from your deck that are either ""Charmer"" monsters, ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters or ""Possessed"" Spells/Traps; then you will add 1 of them to your hand and the other is Set on the field. It can summon the Flip monsters face-down from the Deck, searches backrow, which is really good, and adds consistency to the Deck. It think is obvious you run 3.  Awakening of the Possessed (AotP for short), not the series of monsters, is a Continuous Spell with 3 effects, where only the last one is a hard OPT: <ul>  	<li>ALL MONSTERS YOU CONTROL gain 300 ATK for each different Attribute you control. And yes, it can stack with multiple copies of itself, like TGX300 or Solidarity.</li>  	<li>""Charmer"" and ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters you control cannot be destroyed by card effects.</li>  	<li>As the hard OPT, if you Normal or Special Summon a Spellcaster monster with 1850 ORIGINAL ATK, draw 1 card (is mandatory, for some reason).</li> </ul> Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin is their Field Spell that negates the first monster effect used by your opponent as long as you control a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def. It also has an additional effect to search monsters with 1500 Atk/200 Def, but is mainly played due to the negate.  Moving to the traps, Possessed Partnerships is a Normal Trap that Special Summons a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def from your hand or GY, and then destroys a face-up card on the field if you control 2 or more different Attributes. It can also banish itself from the GY to place a ""Possessed"" Continuous Spell/Trap from the GY on the field, face-up.  The last card is Unpossessed, a Continuous Trap with 3 effects, the last one being a hard OPT, like AotP: <ul>  	<li>""Charmer"" monster cannot be destroyed by battle, helping to their playstyle and to maintain control of the stolen monster.</li>  	<li>""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters gains 800 ATK when attacking an opponents monster. (They don't get ATK with direct attacks or while being attacked).</li>  	<li>The hard OPT, and oh boy this is a mouthful, is that if a monster(s) is destroyed by any means while this card is already face-up on the field: You can Special Summon from your Deck a Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def in Attack Position or face-down Defense Position, but its Attribute must be different from the destroyed monster(s).</li> </ul> For the outside support, and the reason I made the new rule, are the following: <ul>  	<li>Dharc &amp; Lyna: For some reason, the Structure Deck does not come with Dharc &amp; Lyna, despite they covering some of the most popular Attributes ever played, and also being the Attributes with the most amount of monsters. For that reason, and also for the possible search their ""Familiar-Possessed"" do, I added them to the mix.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Eda the Sun Magician: If Normal or Flip Summoned, it can Special Summon any Spellcaster monster with 1500 Def from the Deck in face-down Defense Position. During the opponent's turn, as a Quick-Play, can flip a face-down Spellcaster monster to face-up Attack Position. I add it for placing an specific ""Charmer"" monster on the field and then use it for disruption for the opponent's turn, possibly stealing a playmaker, that is if they aren't destroyed beforehand.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>There are no Extra Deck monsters on the Structure Deck, not even the Link-2 Charmers. You can go wild in this section, but for my recommendation, I suggest both Lyna and Aussa for Attribute coverage and to steal monsters for link climbing, Selene for revival of the Main Deck Spellcasters and also link climbing, any Link-4 or higher monster that is generic (I went with Borrelsword Dragon and Underworld Goddess), Day-Breaker for a bit of extra removal, and finally, any R4NK Xyz Monster (I decided for Tornado Dragon for backrow removal and The Lightning package).</li> </ul> Anyway, I hope you enjoy the decklist and for the next time, it will be the Obelisk and Slifer Structure Decks. Until next time!"

Mainly going for red super nova dragon which is really hard to deal with for some decks. The deck can also easily OTK with quite a lot of special summons and high ATK dragons. The main problem is that the deck runs out of resources very fast and has only little recovery due to red rising dragon's and ede imp saber's GY effects. Super polymerization just destroys the deck most of the time. Other hand traps are also very problematic to deal with. The main play of the deck is to summon crimson resonator and edge imp tomahawk which mills edge imp sabers. Then synchro for red rising dragon, summon back crimson resonator, summon creation and synkron resonator with crimson, go for red super nova dragon, add creation resonator back with synkron resonator and summon it, then summon edge imp sabers, synchro for another red rising dragon and go for red dragon archfiend abyss to get a negate.  https://youtu.be/xNoID6bXtN8"

This rips two cards and establishes what I call 'The Monarch Lock'. Domain with a Monarch locks out of extra deck, and if you have a majesty's then you also get a monster effect lock. You can also just use Erupt as your monster effect lock. Most of the time, the extra deck lock can really shut down some decks and if it doesn't, game two you can side for something like sphere mode or another Caius the mega monarch.  This may sound confusing but trust me this deck is pretty simple to understand.  &nbsp;  Again, any suggestions are appreciated."

Have fun! ,"Usually with Fluffals, they're a going second deck. This deck can fluctuate depending on your starting hand. If you have Polymerization in your starting hand, then you're in great shape. If you have Divine Wrath in your starting hand, you should try to hold onto that for a little while because it might be destroyed if you set it first turn. Once you Fusion summon once, do it again if you want depending on the current board state. If you are going second, then try to go into Daredevil as soon as possible, but go into Frightfur Sheep otherwise."

Normal the lvl 4 rock -&gt; Activate Researcher -&gt; activate Analyzer. Use the effect of Researcher and Analyzer you are looking to hit Adamancipator Crystal Dragite to draw a card or Koa'Ki Mieru Guardian to protect the board or plays. Synchro into Adamancipator Risen Raptite to special a rock from top 5. Link 2 for Crystron Halqifibrax to special Researcher or Seeker. Link 2 for Predaplant Verte Anaconda using Halqifibrax. Synchro into Borreload then equip Halqifibrax. Activate Verte Anaconda to send Red-Eyes Fusion, Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Dark Magician from the deck to the graveyard. The Fossil Engine is used to create beaters in the grind game or to make a material to extend plays. A 2 card combo would be Miracle Rupture and Adamancipator Signs. Use Rupture to send Dragite from deck to grave and then use signs to Special Dragite from the GY. Use the effects to add Researcher or Seeker to the top of the deck then draw with Dragite to start your combo. Problems are bricking with Dragun materials and being unable to extend from a handtrap or whiff."

Overlay 2 level 6 dragunity on your field into Atum. Now use Atum to detach Gae Dearg and SSummon Darkness Metal from your Deck (DMetal should be in Defense Position bc its ATK/DEF will be 0). Now activate DMetal to SSummon Gae Dearg from GY once again then activate Gae Dearg again to add and discard Baby Roc and immediately SSummon Baby Roc. That is the basic 1 card-combo. It will end up you having 4 monsters on the field and then you can link your monster into anything your like (L2 Spheres to bounce your opponent's monster, L4 Borrelsword of Apollousa for main beater or negations, or L2 Whelp, send Dragon Buster to the GY and somehow equip it to one of your beater by DMZ Dragon to lock your opponent from SSummon from his/her Extra). After that, you can still make better board using remain cards in your hand. Here's some ways: <ul>  	<li>Now if you still have Ravine in your hand and 1 card, you can either use Ravine to send Absorouter in order to add Tracer to your hand, NSummon it, destroy Ravine by its effect and go for Crystal Wing, Chaos Ruler or Borreload Savage (equip it with Romulus and get 2 negates), OR send White or Black Dragon to GY to get the remain, SSummon it and link for Pisty and revive some Dragon</li>  	<li>If you have World Legacy Guardragon, it's great bc you can use it with Ravine to perform many nice play, like making 1-level 8 synchro (Chaos Ruler or Savage Dragon, but I prefer Chaos Ruler 'cause it can get Synchron by chance with its effect and it can be easily revived) then somehow, mostly by SSummon your Rokket Synchron back with WLG which was luckily send to GY by Chaos Ruler effect or Ravine (if you have multiple copies of it in your hand), to synchro into Hot Red Dragon</li> </ul> Advantages:  -Short combos and not complicated  -Multiple negations and attacks with huge ATK in case you make the best board  -Hard to break after being made successful  -Multiple ways to start combo (Dragunity Start Combo, Rokket Start Combo, White/Black Dragon Start Combo)  -Multiple ways to beat your opponent (Borreload S. Dragon, Crystal Wing, Hot Red Dragon and mostly Borrelsword D.)  Drawbacks:  -Totally stopped and destroyed by hand traps  -Can easily trigger your OP 's nibiru  -Due to the banlist, it's now weaker than many decks (Drytron, Tri-Brigade, Shaddoll)  -Can be destructed by multiple destroying unstoppable cards (Accesscode Talker)"

I made a deck like this about three years as just a fun casual deck to get me back a little into Yu-Gi-Oh and I didn't realize how much some of these cards are now. So definitely not a budget deck but I wanted to add some stuff to it and all of the cards I added are inexpensive so I think you can salvage something for a budget if you wanna try it out. I have yet to try this one out yet so once I can add the cheap cards I'll test it and depending on the results I might edit this or leave it. This was just a way to visualize how I would mix up the deck and what cards I'm going to add.
