Swarm with Cyber Dragons and recycle monsters extremely easily.,"Depending on your starting hand, you have many different options with this deck. I currently use it and find it extremely fun and good at recycling all my monsters.  If you start with an Orcust monster in your hand, it's time to start building up to get all your Orcust Links out. Harp Horror allows you to special summon Cymbal Skeleton from the deck by banishing from the graveyard, and then if you summon another machine monster, you can get out Galatea, who will then allow you to send Harp Horror back to the deck to get a free Orcust spell (and I always choose Babel, which allows you to use the effects of any Orcust monster as a quick effect). If you can get Einsatz onto the field as well, even better, as this will allow you to build your graveyard or banish zone with Orcust monsters when your opponent summons a monster, allowing you to use each of their effects to help build up towards Orcustrion, and building upto Orcustrion and linking it is extremely easy as you can use Cybmal Skeleton to special summon another Orcust Link you used to build up to Orcustrion back, and have them pointing at each other, protecting them. And if you get Orcustrated Core out as well, you're able to refill your banished monsters easily from the graveyard, allowing you to be able to use the Orcust Link monster's effects when needed, and as a added bonus, Longirus and Orcustrion's effects affect any opponent's linked monsters, not just ones your Links are pointing to, making your opponent's own Links dangerous.  If you start with Cyber Dragons in your hand, you want to focus on getting Cyber Network out to banish Cyber Dragons for later, which is easier to get if you have Cyber Dragon Core as it allows you to get a Cyber spell/trap from your deck to your hand if normal summoned. You can even use Orcustrated Core to banish more of you Cyber Dragons so that when Cyber Network is destroyed, even if it's destroyed early, you can special summon ANY banished Light Machine monster, not just the ones sent by Cyber Network's effect. Your aim to to build up to Cyber Dragon Sieger as his effect will cover the majority of this deck's boss monsters, allowing you to add 2100 ATK and DEF to any machine monster with 2100+ ATK as long as you haven't attack with it yet, and making you (and your opponent) take no damage from attacks involving Sieger. You also want to try and summon out your Cyber Dragon Infinity as this will allow you to attach attack position monsters to it once per turn, and that includes your opponent's monsters, allowing you to clear their board, and if they try to negate/destroy Infinity, you're able to use his other effect (once per turn) to negate a card/effect and destroy it by removing 1 material, and if you're building up his material each turn, he becomes a big nuisance for your opponent.  The other cards in this deck are built around trying to recycle cards or fill your graveyard so you can utilize Orcustrated Core as your Orcust Link monsters are gonna be recycling all your monsters, so you don't need to worry much about losing your Extra Deck monsters. All your other Cyber Dragons are used for linking/fusing/XYZ, and with a few different ways to do this (such as Cyberload Fusion allowing you to use your banished monsters as materials). Swift Scarecrow was put in as a way to help stall if you've been unlucky enough to not pull any Orcust/Cyber Dragons, and because it's a Machine monster, you're able to put him back into the deck using Orcusts, or are able to use him for linking or fusing.  If you get a mixture, I personally start out with Orcust as I feel that you rely on them a bit more.  If you can get DNA Surgery out, you can turn all your opponent's monsters into Machine types too allowing you to clear their board with Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, or using Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon to clear out your opponent's monster in the Extra Zone. You do need to have a Cyber Dragon on the field to do this, but thanks to all their effects, every variation of Cyber Dragon in this deck is treated as Cyber Dragon when on the field/graveyard. And Machine Duplication is great for either side, as if you use it on Cyber Dragon Core, you get to special summon your 2 Cyber Dragons as its' name becomes Cyber Dragon, and if you use it on Orcust Brass Bombard, you have your material for Galatea immediately.  d iI also added in 2 Transmigration Prophecy so you can recycle some spell and traps too. As for Cyber Eternity Dragon, Chimeratech Overdragon and Cyber Twin Dragon, they're more ways to utilize your fusion cards and big hitters/defenders to help stall for longer if needed. Also added in a Soul Absorption to maximize on the constant banishing, and reasoning as it's fine to have cards go to the graveyard to search out another monster."

I also included 3x <strong>Orcustrated Einsatz</strong> for a better chance of having it or <strong>Orcustrated Babel</strong> on the hand/field as important playmaker. 2x <strong>Mystical Space Typhoon</strong> to replace <strong>Twin-Twisters. </strong>No hand traps but 2x <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> instead.  <strong>Orcustrated Return</strong> would be a better choice to replace <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> but this is a budget variant so...  The Extra Deck consists of the typical Orcust Lineup as well as Support cards which help to overcome or negate card effects of your opponent. The most expensive card here would be <strong>Topologic Bomber Dragon</strong> which can your opponents Monster Board in his turn.  In the Side Deck is the Cardtrooper Engine an extra <strong>Brass Bombard</strong> if you want to have extra <strong>Machine Dup.</strong> targets as well as the new Orcust Cards that appear in Savage Strike.

It's basically pure Madolche with a LOT of stupid garbage tech cards. I'm going to go one by one with every stupid card I filled my deck with.  <strong>Main Deck</strong>  Puddingcess at 1: Basically just a combo piece for Puddingcessour, or maybe a early game combo with Mewfuille if both are drawn. However, tributes get really bricky really fast in this deck, so running more than 1 is not recommended.  Chouxvalier at 2: He's suitable battle protection for lower level monsters, and has a decent body. Also Rank 4 plays are really nice.  Messengelato at 3: Jesus in card form. If you have Hootcake or Mewfuille on the field, he farts out the field spell, Ticket, or Palooza for free. Really nice. Also rank 4 plays.  Butlerusk at 1: He's Madolche Terraforming. Chateau is so good that it's totally worth sacrificing a normal summon. Also, R A N K  4  Puddingcessour at 3: This. Fucking. Card. Its so good. Your grave should never have anything in it, so it's two free monsters with its effect, one of them being freely searched from the deck. If you want a spell, Hootcake. If you want Tiaramisu, or Dreadnaught Dreadnoid, or Chocolat-A-La-Mode, you have a Puddingcess. There are other options I'm sure, but these are what I've done so far. This is the best thing in this deck and running any less than 3 is a stupid idiot decision. I would run 5 if I could.  Mageiline at 3: Its free searching at the cost of a normal summon. Run 3.  Anjelly at 3: Its free searching and summoning at the cost of a tribute. Run 3.  Hootcake at 2: Anjelly but it banishes stuff. Also beast-type, so combos with Messengelato. I only run 2 because its kinda cloggy for the early duel.  Mewfuille at 1: It's a slower Puddingcessour. There are more in the extra deck if you want more, and it does combo with Messengelato, but it's not a favorite of mine.  Ash Blossom at 2: Hand traps. That is all.  Fang of Critias: Now, this is the moment you start questioning my sobriety, sanity and/or what profile you're reading. ""Why is there a random dragon support card in here?"" I hear you cry. Well, its a free unga-bunga beater with Mirror Force, and there are 3 Mirror Forces here.  Raigeki: Field nuke. Useful for opening up the board and I like me some nukes.  Desires at 2: Plus 2. You may say there are a lot of 1 ofs in the deck. Well, that's why there's only 2. Just don't use it before you get the field spell up because you really want it.  Double Summon at 3: Basically I run this because I'm stupid and don't understand Brilliant Fusion. I assume it works as well, but then you might have to remove tech cards and that's the point of this deck.  Terraforming at 1: Basically Butlerusk but it's backrow. You could swap one for the other depending on what you like.  Madolche Ticket at 2: This card is a win more card. If you have Tiaramisu on the field and this on the field, you basically played Exodia and won. GG. But it's dead in the hand if you don't have the tools to play it.  Chateau at 3: I run 3 of these, yet I never find it in my hand when I draw. Always have to search it. It's an amazing boost and great recovery from a sweep. I could run half my deck with this card. I love it so much. See, Konami. This is a man's field spell. Not this Neo Space, Kyoto Waterfront looking asses. This is peak preformance.  Evenly Matched at 2: It's new age early game Mirror Force. Why it isn't limited, I am unaware. But if you bricked and have this, it doesn't let anyone have fun.  Madolchepalooza at 1: It's a somewhat useful protection on Battle Phase, and you can just fart out just all the monsters any time.  Mirror Force at 3: I love this card so much, so f*ck you I run 3.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Mirror Force Dragon at 1: I like him. He's Mirror Force, but a monster. Chouxvalier + Mirror Force Dragon works surprisingly well as a consistent nuke if this thing hits the field. You could run 2, but I don't  Number 27: Dreadnaught Dreadnoid at 2, Super Dreadnaught Railcannon Gustav MAX at 1, and Number 81: Super Dreadnaught Railcannon Superior Dora at 1: I know, this extra deck looks funky to you so far. But trust me, the Rank 4 boat works as a tech. If you don't have Chateau up, farting out a boat instead of Tiaramisu is more optimal, due to equal ATK and the ability to get a Superior Dora or Gustav MAX out soon after, depending on what you like. I personally like Gustav but both have come in clutch. Sometimes, having 2 cute anime dolls fuse into a boat instead of the physical embodiment of smug is more optimal.  Queen Tiaramisu at 3: The physical embodiment of smug. She has multiple non-target, non-destruction removal, twice per life. She doesn't have the signature Madolche mill effect, but she shouldn't be dying so who cares.  Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode at 1: She's an option if you want more attack on Tiaramisu, and thats it really. Her effects are good but I like Tiaramisu more. You can run more if you like.  Firewall Dragon at 1: It's the best Link and I'm a meta sheep so yeah. It's good. Trust me.  Knightmare Phoenix at 2: It's like Tiaramisu but a easier. Easier to summon, easier to interrupt, and easier to play around. Useful quite often.  Knightmare Unicorn at 2: Honestly its like Phoenix but more. More complex, more effects. Just, more. Run more by preference.  <strong>Side Deck (AKA, the t e c h)</strong>  Winged Dragon of Ra: Sphere Mode at 2 and Winged Dragon of Ra at 2: Sphere Mode is like a Kaiju but more funny because it can fart out a Ra on your side soon after. I run it in matchups where I just can't get advantage.  Mewfuille at 2: If I want more swarming, I replace Desires with Cats. This card is good, but kinda bland imo. Run it all you want.  Ash Blossom at 1: See above about Ash Blossom.  Pot of Benevolence at 1: It's a plus sometimes. Also you can be nice and help your opponent win if you're losing and bricking super hard. Overall just a positive vibe.  Dark Hole at 1: It's Evenly Matched but old and for everyone. If I can't have fun, no one can.  Burial from a Different Dimension at 1: A tech card with Hookcake. It's a lot more viable and useful then you think.  Madolche Lesson at 1: It can do stuff. It's just kinda bricky. If you are confident in your Mewfuille/Messengelato combo, then run it if you wanna win more.  Floodgate Trap Hole: Wow there's a lot of stun cards. It's almost like this guy plays Altergeists too. What the heck? Yeah this card it funny because it basically just makes a card take up space, completely unusable.  Solemn Strike at 2: Wow more stun. Strike is always good, but the Solemns are all preference. Unless you play Wish. Then you and I need to negotiate a restraining order.  &nbsp;  Playstyle:  There isn't necessarily one. It's more of a mindset. A mindset that requires a lot of sleep deprivation and/or alcohol to understand. It's a simple idea. You win. But how? It's all up to you, and the cards. Between Tiaramisu, Chocolat-A-La-Mode, the Dreadnaughts, MFD, and all those links, you have a lot of power. With Mirror Force, Solemn Strike, Ash Blossom, etc, you have a lot of removal and stun. With Mageline, Messengelato, Puddingcessour, Anjelly, etc... you have a lot of consistency. It's a versatile deck, and the perfect drunk deck. You can play it how you want, and you're still not wrong! Stylish, safe, stupid. It's like Captain Falcon in Smash Bros. (Note: I have obviously only played this on simulator. I have no idea how it works irl.)  Moral of the story? Release Puddingcessour in the US please I wanna say I play a tier 1 deck."

This deck is insane (in a good way). After spending about a week crafting and play testing this deck from scratch this is what I have come up with. The ultimate goal of this deck is to just completely lock your opponent out of their monsters and plays. The Trickstar monsters do not care if they surrounded with floodgates because <a data-name=""Trickstar Candina"">Trickstar Candina</a> has a base attack of 1800 which is really good and will be hard for your opponent to get over. And even if they are somehow able to, that's why the deck plays <a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>. I've been playing around with 2 and 3 Honest and I like 2 better than 3 because I always see it when I don't need to. <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>, <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, and <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> just completely annihilates your opponent's monster board. This deck always wants to go first because setting the floodgates on the first turn is crucial to stop your opponent from playing on their first turn. Also, since the <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> combo is still a thing, I have added 3 Droll and 3 Reincarnation. It works out very well and every time I've play tested I've opened with either floodgates or the Droll Reincarnation plus searching one off Candina which means double Reincarnation so you can do the combo at their first Standby Phase. A tech I really love using is <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>, all you need is the Candina search and even if you don't get it because you get ashed you can use Duality to dig and get to either a floodgate or another Reincarnation which is really helpful. Don't worry about using <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> because you can use her on your opponents Draw Phase or Standby Phase. The 400 damage isn't really worth sweating over, it's better to get a floodgate or Droll Reincarnate your opponent than deal 400 to 1200 damage on your opponents first draw. Now this may sound crazy but <a data-name=""Soul Drain"">Soul Drain</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> in this deck is crazy good. Soul Drain just completely stops your opponent from doing anything in their graveyard with monster effects. Skill Drain on the other hand, does nothing to you because if you want to normal summon Candina you just have to use a Lycoris in hand to bounce the Candina back and then you still get to search while your opponent is just sitting there suffering from the effects of Skill Drain. I also really like <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> because it can stop your opponent from link summoning or summoning any kind of extra deck monster. It also allows your Candina or Lycoris to get over any monster that has a big attack. Now the thing you guys will also really like is the extra deck. The level 3 xyz <a data-name=""Mechquipped Angineer"">Mechquipped Angineer</a> is such a staple for Trickstars because you can go into it  with double Lycoris while your under Gozen Match, Rivalry of Warlords, or both since it is a light monster and a Fairy type! Same with <a data-name=""Fairy Cheer Girl"">Fairy Cheer Girl</a> except she is used with double Candina or Honest since she is a rank 4! It's effect says you draw 1 card for free which is awesome. Most of the side deck is for going second which your opponent will most likely force you to do if you win game 1 since they know you are running floodgates. I'm really tired of the Danger Darkworld FTK so therefore I put in Ghost Reaper and Ghost Ogre because it is really good to kill off <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> and prevent them from doing the FTK. Also, I have said this before but <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> really hurts Sky Strikers. Taking their Kagari or Shizuku and linking it away means they don't get to use Raye's effect from grave to special summon herself. I really hope you guys enjoy this deck because I put a lot of effort into making it and play testing! Stick around for more :)."

Most people looking into this deck should probably already know what the deck tries to do, and most things in this deck are pretty standard outside of a few things. Which I will go into why they're being played now.  Unending nightmare is a nifty little way to get rid of opposing back row while also being a trap so you can chain your own paleos to it, and since it's once per chain meaning you could use it multiple times per turn if you're able to take out a whole lot of back row. Although it's only useful on decks that use spells and traps that stay face up on the field, such as flood gates so I limit it to one copy and keep it in the side. It can also be swapped out for a Solem judgement of one so desires.  Lilith can tribute itself on normal summon to reveal three normal traps and your opponent chooses to set one to the field. This is obviously good as all your paleos are normal traps and since you want all your paleos set to the field at one point or another no matter what your opponent picks is good for you.  and Paleozoic Marrella and Pikaia are played as they're both able to send a paleo to the grave for set up. Marrella has the bonus that it can send from the deck and isn't just limited to paleos, and pikaia says draw two on it do of course you gotta play two.  also Marrella has a cute face and looks like a nice guy so of worse comes to worse he's great moral support for the player."

I have a deck profile for you! After talking to my friend Demyx for some time who has been playing Phantom Knights for a long time and is really good with the deck, he has shared with me his Phantom Knights deck. Demyx has recently won the Davinator1212 $100 Budget Tournament for 2018 with his budget Phantom Knights build! This is not the budget build he won with, but rather his full best build. This deck is very persistent. It does not care about losing resources from the hand or field because it can recover very quickly by using the Phantom Knight's card's effects in the graveyard. All the Phantom Knight cards have some kind of graveyard effect that they can banish themselves to search or special summon a Phantom Knight from your grave. The trap cards can be banished from grave to special summon a Phantom Knight monster in grave to the field. The Phantom Knight monsters say that they can banish themselves to search a Phantom Knight card or Phantom Knight spell or trap. <a data-name=""Burial from a Different Dimension"">Burial from a Different Dimension</a> is extremely effective in this deck because it can bring back up to 3 banished cards to the graveyard meaning you get to search or special summon 3 more times! That is insane. Also the new Phantom Knight link monster, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> is really good because it can send a Phantom Knight monster from the deck to graveyard to set a Phantom Knight spell or trap directly from the deck to the field! That's really good because then not only do you get a free Phantom Knight spell or trap to use of your choice but you can search another Phantom Knight card from the deck by banishing the monster you sent off Rusty Bardiche. Congratulations to my friend who won the tournament and I really hope you guys like his deck. Also stick around because in 2 to 5 days I will post some really awesome decks I have been working on and am really excited to share with you guys!"

General combo is to make a Tomahawk using level 7 Kaijus, Ascended of Thunder/Dino, or Burei. Use eff and Link into Qliphort Genius (in the Extra Zone not in front of enemy Kaiju). Synchro Token and tuners into Burei/Bureidos; making Nishipachi at the end and draw 2. Link token and Genius into Summon Sorceress (in zone in front of enemy Kaiju). If the Kaiju is Thunder King or Dogoran, Sorceress can pull Ascended Thunder and Dinowrestler Pankratops (respectively) in addition to the same Kaiju. You'll want to make a combo of True King of All Calamities + Hope Harbinger / Dracossack, or all three if the hand is good enough.  If they have no defenses, sometimes you can just FTK with Vermillion, Thunder King and Junk Giant, using Vermillion to pop the Kaiju you gave them, and swing for 8000.  Unfortunately, the Extra Deck space is so tight, there's no room for Black Rose Dragon, Big Eye, Divine Felgrand etc.  Tips:  -Go second even if you win dice roll. Preferrably you lose dice roll so they pick first without knowing you prefer going second, if the Kaiju deck doesn't make it obvious to them.  -Even if you are using Radian to make a Tomahawk which will fill your board with Tokens, if you can use his eff, summon a Radian Token because it will count as a separate name for Saryuja.  -Put Qliphort Genius on the zone away from Kaiju so you can use it's both it's Link arrows, then Link it with Summon Sorceress in front of Kaiju to maximize usage of the Link arrows.  -Remember, enemies can use the Quick Effect Kaijus if you have Kyoutou Waterfront so either avoid giving them that Kaiju or manage your plays around it."

It's another name to discard for Return or by banished for the Links, it helps you mill what you need, either to extend your own plays or to not need Einsatz in your opponent's turn, it's a target for <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> that gives us enough excuse to run it now, and while Mermaid being WATER is a bit tricky to work around the Knightmare name leads to a number of cool interactions.  <a data-name=""Orcustrated Release"">Orcustrated Release</a>... exists. I don't revile it like Attack, but not being minus one in card advantage requires a condition and Orcust doesn't really swarm with things you're happy to Tribute. I don't play it. <h2>The Techs</h2> As mentioned, <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> is now a great card in the deck. Besides Knightmare, it can target Brass Bombard or even ""World Wand"", though Knightmare is the best option. Speaking of her, <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> can do some good work. If you summon Orcustrated Knightmare in your opponent's End Phase to avoid the restriction, you can summon Mermaid then Iblee or even another copy. Meanwhile, drawing into Iblee is far from the end of the world, Normal Summoning her and summoning Orcustrated Knightmare from the deck is as good of a play-starter as Armageddon Knight, to the point where it might be worth experimenting with multiple copies.  The only reason I didn't run <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> in the Soul Fusion deck was budget, and since this deck is currently for a future/imaginary format anyway I don't care as much. Level 8 is much better than 4 or 5 for DARK Synchros, and <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> comes out at just the right time. Equipping Orcustrion, Bomber Dragon or Longirsu gives you multiple negations and a fearsome attack value. Meanwhile, you have a lot of Level 7 monsters flying around after a good Machine Duplication, so you can play Rank 7 monsters like <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. <a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a>, besides just being a card I really like is an option going first - the DARK restriction bars us from classics like <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>, but in real life where Number 89 is a prize card you might want to replace it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon</a> or just not bother. <h2>The Removals</h2> With more monsters to work with, we don't need ""World Crown"" any more, though it's still a nice card you might want to try playing if you want to build things slightly differently. We also don't need as much mill (at least, not as much as we do need more space), and I cut Mathematician - there's not much difference between it and Scrap Recycler. I also cut one Babel for space, since in addition to being searchable it can also recur itself. It might be worth siding a spare copy against Cosmic Cyclone, though. <h1>The Plays</h1> All the options introduced by Knightmare make the deck a lot less linear than the Soul Fusion gameplan, and when I play the deck at the moment I mostly just wing it as I go. I don't have a solid combo to describe in detail for you this time. The Armageddon Knight starter should now probably summon Knightmare from Harp Horror, then send your next stage. When starting with Iblee, you'd send Harp Horror off the Knightmare used as Link Material. In either case, if you have Machine Duplication you can use it on Knightmare and get enough resources to do almost anything you want. <h1>Conclusion</h1> Orcustrated Knightmare is a beautiful example of how one card of support can completely revolutionise a deck. For the lore alone I was enamoured with it from the moment its art was leaked, and by the time the effect was translated it easily became one of my favourite cards of all time, even being my Discord Avatar for the Halloween season. The Orcust deck is now an absolute blast to play, and I can't wait for Savage Strike to release in the TCG so I can try the deck at locals. Thanks for reading."

Let's go over the card choices in small groups. <h1>The Cards</h1> <h2>The Core</h2> <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a>, <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> and <a data-name=""Orcust Brass Bombard"">Orcust Brass Bombard</a> are the heart of the deck, their effects in the GY are the engine. Harp Horror is clearly the main playmaker you're aiming to get the GY ASAP, but Cymbal Skeleton has more value on your opponent's turn where you can revive the Link monsters in a pinch. Brass Bombard is obviously not always as useful, as it requires you to have drawn into another Orcust monster, which can be a tall order when the archetype currently has so few names, but for that same reason we need as many as we can get so we still run 3. <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Wand""</a><a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot; ""> </a> is related, but doesn't have the advantage of being summoned by the Orcusts nor becoming a Quick Effect from Babel. It's mostly useful if you need to extend your plays some more after using your other resources.  <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> and <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> all serve the same purpose - without any other sort of engine, the only way we make plays is with our Orcusts in the GY, so we <em>need</em> to achieve that as soon and as much as possible. With an added <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a> to make 10, <a>yugioh.party</a>'s hypergeometric magic tells us we have a 78% chance, which is acceptable considering the deck has multiple draw cards. Armageddon Knight is obviously the most versatile, as the other two can't send ""World Wand"", but most often you'll just be sending Harp Horror.  The Orcustrated Spells are what push Orcust from a cute little engine into a playable deck. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Return"">Orcustrated Return</a> is a classic ""plus zero"" draw card, similar to <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>, with the added benefit that almost anything you send will have an effect once it's in the GY. Later in the game when your hand is empty, you can send a Link monster and just revive it with Cymbal Skeleton. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Einsatz"">Orcustrated Einsatz</a> allows you to prepare resources for disruption on your opponent's turn after exhausting them all on your own, and why have I mentioned the opponent's turn so much when everything's an Ignition effect? Because <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> makes them Quick, just like that. Despite the fact these latter two cards are so important, we only play two copies each, because they're searchable and you can only use one of each at a time.  The Traps aren't quite as illustrious, but I'll explain them for completeness. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Core"">Orcustrated Core</a> gives you something to search when the rest is exhausted and a little bit of protection, as well as getting another card banished for the Link Monsters if you're really desperate. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Attack"">Orcustrated Attack</a> is just bad. <a data-name=""Karma Cut"">Karma Cut</a> has the same effect with a cheaper, generic cost and no activation condition. It's only in the Side Deck because it's half empty anyway and so you can see it.  Now, what's the end goal of all this? <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> searches all your important cards like Babel and Einsatz, with a cost you practically <em>have</em> to have fulfilled before you summon it, which also recycles your resources for future use. <a data-name=""Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator"">Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator</a> is a nifty bit of spot removal, and the card effect immunity without having to ladder all the way up to Link 4 is important for a play we'll get into later. <a data-name=""Orcustrion"">Orcustrion</a>'s effect can be difficult to get the requirements for, but if your opponent has a big board of Link monsters it can be a total blowout.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> are pretty self-explanatory inclusions for a GY-focused deck like this, I would think. <h2>The Techs</h2> <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> has an impressive amount of synergy with Orcust for being a card associated with their Crusadia enemies. As a World Legacy monster, it can fuel the costs for Return and Core, and be summoned by ""World Wand"" - but you don't need to, as it's easy to have it summon itself to a zone which gives all the Orcust Links their protection, after which you can use it to Link ladder or leave it on board as a negation that's not trivial to run over.  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> is nicer than usual in this particular deck, since the banished card can just be recurred with any of the Link effects. <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> is another card you can nullify the downsides of, as Longirsu and Orcustrion can be made immune, or in the worst-case scenario simply revived with Cymbal Skeleton. <a data-name=""Burial from a Different Dimension"">Burial from a Different Dimension</a> is a little bit ""whatever"", but sometimes you can banish faster than you shuffle back and you need some extra resources late in the game.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> can salvage hands that brick into too many Orcust monsters, you simply Normal Summon Brass Bombard, link it away, then use its effect to summon Harp Horror (ideally) and continue into at least Longirsu from there. <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a><a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">,</a> <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> and <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> are there just in case they come but, any tech monsters need to be DARK because of the restrictions on the Orcust monsters. Witch can at least help push for game depending on the board state and matchup. On the other hand, <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> is a major player. Almost any deck that can Special Summon as a Quick Effect has some build that focuses on using Bomber during your opponent's turn, and as a purpose-built DARK Link deck with protected cards like Longirsu that you can summon and have stick around, Orcust is the best one for the job by far.  Note that while I didn't play any, Brass Bombard is a Tuner and you can theoretically make Synchro plays. 4 and 5 aren't great levels though, especially when you can only make DARK monsters. I guess if you really like <a data-name=""Underworld Fighter Balmung"">Underworld Fighter Balmung</a>? As all the Link Monsters only need one material to be from the archetype, Orcust can blend in well as an engine as a hybrid deck, as long as the other half is also DARK, but this deck is meant to demonstrate how they play pure. This deck can absolutely play monsters like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, but this deck is adapted from real life and I can't even begin to afford that nonsense. <h2>The Side</h2> I don't like including a Side Deck in online deck profiles. The ""metagame"" online is an unpredictable, casual mess that rarely plays Match Duels anyway, and even if you take this build in real life, a casual deck shouldn't be expecting meta matchups, and you know your locals better than I do. Nevertheless, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is so cheap, so generic and so good that I can't imagine anyone not bothering, and <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> saves this Machine-type deck from the ever-present threat of <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> (remember when Cyber Dragon could only do that to certain decks?). I also recommend some Spell/Trap removal that doesn't require a summon, though which specific card is up to you. Attack is just there so you can see it. It's bad. Go away, Orcustrated Attack. <h1>The Plays</h1> Pretty much any ideal game will start like so: Normal Summon Armageddon Knight or an equivalent, and send Harp Horror, which will summon Cymbal Skeleton (or Brass Bombard if you have an Orcust in hand) and make Galatea. Your priority order for searching there is Babel &gt; Einsatz &gt; Return (if you have anything spare to send) &gt; Core. A much more underwhelming 1-card combo than Danger! Dark World FTK, but that deck doesn't play mr. skeltal so I think we're the real winners here. Any other way to Special Summon, like Brass Bombard or ""World Crown"" will get you to Longirsu, then Cymbal Skeleton can revive Galatea and make a Link 4.  Going first, the best bet is to go for Topologic Bomber Dragon for disruption. If you can get another Cymbal Skelton back in the GY through Einsatz, Burial from a Different Dimension, or recycling the same Skeleton with ""World Wand"", you can use Babel to summon Longirsu to its zone on the opponent's turn. Longirsu is linked (pointing to and/or being pointed at by any monster on the field), so it won't be destroyed by Bomber, and if you set your zones up right it can point at the free Extra Monster Zone to remove the survivor or any follow-up. The ideal zone setup here is Topologic in the right Extra Monster Zone, and Longirsu in the centre Main Monster Zone pointing at the left. On the other hand, if things are going poorly and you're stuck with Longirsu and Galatea, you want Longirsu in the left Extra Monster Zone so that you can put Galatea in the centre, pointing at the right and enabling their protection.  Bomber can still be useful going second depending on your opponent's board, but if they have no good monster to attack for burn, protection so that you can't blow things up, you have to play through disruption, or you simply opened Limiter Removal and want to go for a cheesy OTK, you might prefer Orcustrion as your Link 4 for protection, negation and synergy. In general Bomber's usefulness declines as a game goes on.  As previously mentioned, if you opened too many Orcust including Brass Bombard you can start with Linkuriboh as a backup strategy.  As far as success goes, Orcust is a very matchup-dependent deck. Losing Special Summons to <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a>, effects to <a data-name=""Inspector Boarder"">Inspector Boarder</a> or GY access to <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> can leave you with very little counterplay (or play at all). As previously mentioned Cyber Dragon can also run roughshod over you as your entire deck is just Fusion Material for a giant Fortress Dragon. Meanwhile, if your opponent sets up a big board of Link Monsters like Cyberse (or maybe even Gumblar Gouki, though I haven't experienced the matchup myself), and you can get out Orcustrion, the game is practically over already. <h1>Conclusion</h1> Orcust have become one of my favourite decks since the moment they were released. Between their aesthetic (doot doot), their gameplay, and the new chapter in the World Legacy lore storyline, I love just about everything about them (except Attack). Hopefully this massive wall of text hasn't scared you off already and I've convinced some people to give it a go. Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you enjoy playing with Orcust."

Burning Abyss OTK 2018 (Going Second) (Post Soul Fusion),"After working with the new Dangers from Soul Fusion, and new Soul Fusion cards in general, this is what I have come up with for Danger! Burning Abyss Chaos Go Second OTK from scratch (as always :)). This deck is really good going second, the new Chaos Dragon, <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> is broke along with Black Luster Soldier and <a data-name=""Orbital Hydralander"">Orbital Hydralander</a>. Orbital Hydralander is so good with Dante because after milling with Dante's effect you will most likely have 5 or more monsters in the grave and can special summon Hydralander. Basically all the monsters in this deck are one ofs so it's almost impossible to mill multiple copies of a monster, meaning you can use Hydralander without having to worry about getting off its effect. I've encountered many games where I can get one of the chaos monsters, plus Dante, plus one or two Hydralander(s) and my opponent just scoops at that point haha. This deck always wants to go second to utilize <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> to the best of their abilities and making your opponent lose all their resources. I got tired of playing Danger Darkworld ftk so I put in <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> in the side deck. It stops the ftk solid. Also <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> are really good to stop <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a>. If you think you will be forced to go first, siding in <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> and the one <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a> will make your opponent quit because sitting on Vanity's means they cannot special summon and you will be able to poke them constantly without them being able to do anything. Sauravis protects Vanity's from target cards like <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a>.

I also want to say how grateful I am that I have you all viewing my decks and keeping up with me. Your support encourages me to continue posting and making cool decks for you guys. Also as a life update for everyone, I find myself being able to post on the weekends so look out for a new deck every weekend (this includes Friday). This deck performed really well in testing and won many games. This deck always wants to go first because using <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> twice or even once hurts your opponent badly, making them lose a lot of their resources, especially in decks that play a lot of one ofs like Altergeist and Gouki. Altergeist has a major problem with resources because if they lose their altergeist monsters, especially specific ones like <a data-name=""Altergeist Silquitous"">Altergeist Silquitous</a> or <a data-name=""Altergeist Kunquery"">Altergeist Kunquery</a>, then they will lose since they won't have any way to interrupt you. If Goukis lose <a data-name=""Gouki Headbatt"">Gouki Headbatt</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a>, it can be pretty bad, depending on how many extenders they draw will determine if they can play without the Headbatt and or Iblee or not. Also burn damage will really kill your opponent when you have 2 or 3 <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> combined with <a data-name=""Trickstar Lightstage"">Trickstar Lightstage</a>. Going first siding in <a data-name=""Dark Room of Nightmare"">Dark Room of Nightmare</a> can inflict some serious damage to your opponent with Lycoris and Reincarnation. I've also found that <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> works really well in this deck and stops most decks from going off since decks like Altergeist have all different attributes. Enjoy the deck!"

Rather than spending resources engaging with the opponent's board, instead channel those resources toward inflicting direct damage. <a data-name=""Hip Hoshiningen"">Hip Hoshiningen</a> (fielded via <a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>) can signficantly increase the Watts' damage output and close games earlier. <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a>, <a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>, and <a data-name=""Number 50: Blackship of Corn"">Number 50: Blackship of Corn</a> contribute burn damage and decrease the number of direct attacks needed.  In the spirit of the original Watts, the rest of the deck focuses on stun and distruption. <a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a> prevents floating effects from activating and protects any summons from the Extra Deck during Main Phase 2. Giraffe's stun is especially potent when combined with <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>.  Finally, cards like <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> and <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> are especially noxious here. Monsters pinned face-down will never be attacked or removed from the field, since the Watts can ignore them and attack directly. Strategies focusing on Link Monsters tend to make Quaking less effective than Floodgate, which is still used to flip monsters face-down before they can be used as material. But in general, there is no shortage of opposing boss monsters in the forms of Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and good old-fashioned Effect Monsters that all fall (or 'flip') to these traps.  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Don't expect a YCS top. Nevertheless, the Watts are an incredibly fun engine that plays competently, challenges your opponent to adapt, and feels genuinely unique to pilot.  &nbsp;"

The main goal of this deck is to get your Phoenix Gearfrieds into the graveyard and then use chevalier and supervise along with other equip cards to clear your opponents field while flooding the field with your own monsters. There's also many other ways to pull out gearfried, as well as your tuners, from the graveyard to consistently give you options to spawn strong monsters through syncing, fusing, and especially using the xyz monsters to handle difficult situations.  The equip cards other than supervise are chosen for extremely useful abilities like discarsing set cards or making your monsters attack +100 your opponents monster. Blast with chain is also a great combo with chevalier that allows you to discard an extra card from your opponents field."

Some characteristics that you can find within this deck:  1) Monsters with high power and that always have very easy summoning conditions. 2) Control of the opponent´s gameplay from 2 different approaches: First, limiting the effects he can activate, second, limiting opponent´s ability to special summon monsters. 3) Large amount of tribute fodder using to 2 different mechanics, Edea-Eidos and The prime monarch (trap card). 4) There is a great balance between tribute fodder and tribute summoning monsters. At least 17 tribute fodders and 10 to 13 tribute summoning monsters. 5) It can easily transformed with its sidedeck to face different strategies used by the opponent. 6) Eventhough there is a very big trade-off, decks that rely on banishing cards from the graveyard or that use Macrocosmos. In this case we will loose the ability to bring our tribute fodders from the graveyard. 7) Once monarchs are up, they are difficult tro bring down thanks to the protection of cards like March of the Monarchs. 8) This is the first deck you will see where Monarchs and Hand traps are combined in order to enhance the oppnent´s control."

These cards allow the deck, with their various levels and monster generating ability, to synchro summon powerful monsters from levels 5 - 10 easily. To start you, the read, off with playing the deck - I'm going to highlight the combo that allows you to essentially start your synchro plays. In addition to me giving an intro to this deck, I'd like to note that when going 2nd - Borrelsword &amp; the black luster soldier link allow this deck to OTK with ease but with that potential gained - the synchro spammability of this deck is also hampered by the fact that we're in a link era that requires significant investment to get multiple arrows.  &nbsp;  Introductory Combo (Starter Combo): you just need 1 way to get to needlefiber, whether that be Armageddon Knight - which is a 1 card starter - or rescue cat. It is important to note, however, that Armageddon Knight is better off used to send Destiny Hero Malicious as Mali allows you to Synchro Summon into two level 8s/7s with ease.  Cards in hand: Rescue Cat + Destiny Hero Malicious <ul>  	<li>Normal Rescue Cat, and activate its effect --&gt; using gallis and valeriafawn to make Needlefiber</li>  	<li>SS Needlefiber, bringing out jet synchron</li>  	<li>SS Summon Sorc using Jet Synchron and needlefiber</li>  	<li>Activate Jet Synchron, pitching malicious --&gt; Jet Synchron goes to one of Summon Sorc's zones</li>  	<li>Target Jet Synchron and SS Mecha Phantom Beast-O lion into your other zone (Summon Sorc)</li>  	<li>SS Borreload Savage Dragon, using O-lion + Malicious --&gt; leaves you with Summon Sorc, one zone has borreload savage dragon and you have jet synchron in the other <ul>  	<li>CL 1: Generate O-Lion token in an open (non-Link) zone, CL 2: Borreload target needlefiber --&gt; add 2 counters, ATK raised to 3750</li>  	<li>At this point you can recur Mali to make a level 7 [clear wing or dawn dragster mainly] (and if you have another tuner produced - level 1 - you can go into something like Clear Wing or Scarlight), or you can recur mali to go into a Link 3 with Summon Sorc + Jet + Mali, or you can use the o-lion token + mali + jet synchron to go into a level 10 Synchro (in the event that you're playing something like Ascension Sky Dragon - which would become a 3200 beatstick or Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The way in which danger helps this combo: they allow you to make better link plays and help with regards to Synchro Summoning on the lower end and higher end of the spectrum (below 7 and above 8).  Spicy Tech Choices: Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree, Galaxy Tomahawk (Rank 7), Number 38 (Rank 8), Dracossack (Rank 7), Zephyros the Elite, Blackwing Steam the Cloak"

It focuses on the use of ""Umi"", with cards from ""Fury from the Deep"". I also added in more ","(Updated) I have recently got back into Yu-gi-oh! so wanted to try making a deck using some of my old Fury from the Deep structure deck cards. The main card from the deck were ""<a data-name=""Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus"">Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" (Umi), so I decided I wanted to use cards that synergise well with ""Umi"". I also decided that I wanted to keep to the strategy of the deck (using ""Umi"" to reduce the levels of monsters, and using gravity bind to protect my Lvl4 monsters.  Overarching strategy: <ol>  	<li>By using ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"", I can reduce the level of all the monsters, meaning the Lvl7s will only need 1 tribute, and the Lvl5s will not need tributes, allowing my to more easily put out some bigger cards. Also combining ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Gravity Bind"">Gravity Bind</a>"" gives all my Lvl4s some protection whilst also letting them attack.</li>  	<li>I wanted to have plenty of search-ability from my monsters so I could keep monsters coming all through the game. In Fury from the Deep, there was no way to search for ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" so I decided to remedy that by adding in 2 ""<a data-name=""Warrior of Atlantis"">Warrior of Atlantis</a>"" cards as well as Terraforming, allowing me to search for all 3 ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" cards if need be. ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" also allows me to search ""<a data-name=""Lemuria, the Forgotten City"">Lemuria, the Forgotten City</a>"", which could lead to help with some extra deck summons, or provide me with a discard for ""<a data-name=""Umi"">Umi</a>"" abilities. For other searches, I have ""<a data-name=""Stronghold Whale"">Stronghold Whale</a>"" searching ""<a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a>"", ""<a data-name=""The Legendary Fisherman II"">The Legendary Fisherman II</a>"" searching for the big boss monsters. I then have ""<a data-name=""Shark Cruiser"">Shark Cruiser</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Mother Grizzly"">Mother Grizzly</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Deep Diver"">Deep Diver</a>"" to help with further searching of the cards I need.</li>  	<li>I also wanted lots of re-usability from my monsters, and since I had many cards that either tribute, destroy, or banish cards, I needed plenty of revival to accomplish this. Since I had two ""<a data-name=""Fenrir"">Fenrir</a>""s, ""<a data-name=""Friller Rabca"">Friller Rabca</a>"" banishing its self, and ""<a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a>"" banishing more cards, I decided to include ""<a data-name=""Pot of Acquisitiveness"">Pot of Acquisitiveness</a>"", as well as ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" to bring my banished card back so I can re-use them. I especially like ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" as I can bring back all my banished cards by equipping them to him, and the equipped cards will go to the graveyard rather than back to banishment. Also I can revive ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" and then re-use him, and all the banished cards again. For regular revival, ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"", ""<a data-name=""After the Storm"">After the Storm</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Torrential Reborn"">Torrential Reborn</a>"". I also decided to add in ""<a data-name=""Divine Dragon Aquabizarre"">Divine Dragon Aquabizarre</a>"" to enable me to retrieve either ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"", or one of the other ""Umi"" substitutes if need be.</li> </ol> That's the main gist with this deck. This is my first deck build since getting back into the game so I'm sure there will be loads of other cards out there that would better compliment this deck. Therefore I'd gladly welcome C&amp;Cs so that I can improve this style of deck further."

You normal summon Ra, pay all but 100 life points, and do your damage. If anything were to happen to Ra, use Mystik Wok to tribute him, get your life points back, then get Immortal Phoenix of the field since Ra went to the graveyard.

I would try to use Stormforth first since it allows you to still attack same turn.</li>  	<li>Use Moray as needed if you need to get that extra draw power.</li>  	<li>The extra deck is there to help a little with survivability if you can't get Ra out right away.

Fabled Sekka's Light OTK 2018 Ft. Jerry*db (Going Second) (Post Soul Fusion/SOFU),"Alright so I'm really excited to post this deck because my close friend Jerry and I who you may know from my custom 60 Card Grass Looks Greener Deck have been working on and have come up with an amazing Pure Danger Going Second OTK deck. This deck is insane! Sky Strikers and any other control heavy/stun based deck has a hard time dealing with this deck, especially the Dangers because there are not enough negates to setup for all the cards you have. Jerry reminded me the other day as we were going over the deck and card choices about <a data-name=""Witch of The Black Rose"">Witch of The Black Rose</a> and I said oh your right this card is busted in Dangers since I remember it back from the 5D's era. So I added it in it and then he reminded me of <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a> and <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a> and told me I can <a data-name=""Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons</a>. I realized what a busted combo that is and added it all in! Not to mention <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> baits ash and literally gives you so much advantage if it goes off. The Fabled engine is another spicy tech in this deck, except I came up with this one. The Fabled cards just spam link monsters like crazy and win you the game. Sometimes going into <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> can be enough to make your opponent cry after you spam all the Dangers out and the other extenders. The reason I don't like <a data-name=""Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk"">Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk</a> in this deck is because there is not enough space to fit a bunch of other link monsters like <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and <a data-name=""Proxy Dragon"">Proxy Dragon</a>. All the extra deck monsters I already have in the deck come up so they are needed. <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is a <a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a> <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>. I love having my opponent discard <a data-name=""The Fabled Catsith"">The Fabled Catsith</a> because then I get to pop something for free and it's really annoying to them haha. Once again, huge shoutout to Jerry for helping me with this deck. Jerry is an excellent Yu-Gi-Oh! player and is one of the best card sellers on the Yu-Gi-Oh! market. He has the lowest prices on eBay and has over 30,000 positive reviews on his eBay profile.

Each component can buffer or create a synergy for Lair of Darkness and it's boss monster, Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair.  Main Deck:  The Lair of Darkness cards included are Diabolos, Ahrima, Lilith, and the Lair field spell. The monsters revolve around tributes to get Diabolos and virus trap support on the field, and the field spell provides superb monster removal. It's slow to start and needs a lot of non-archetypal support to engage it's engine. Once, it gets moving, Diabolos can replace itself as a tribute target, granting you additional tribute resources to build up Lair tokens.  The virus trap support includes Eradicator Epidemic, Grinning Grave, and Deck Devastation, for better control and flexibility.  Non-archetypal spell support for Lair of Darkness can include Allure, Foolish Burial, Downbeat, Terraforming and Monster Reborn. These cards greatly speed up Lair of Darkness. Non-archetypal monster support includes Destrudo, Phantom Skyblaster, and Abyss Actor Curtain. These provide free resources that can be used as targets for Downbeat/Lair of Darkness.  In addition to all that dark support, there is a lot of support coming from Trickstars and Sky Strikers.  Trickstars do not directly support Lair of Darkness, but Lair of Darkness and the non-archetypal spell support can greatly support Trickstars. At a small splash of 6 monsters, they provide a massive buffer to buy you time and slowly but surely chip away at your opponent's life points. Candina is highly reliable and should be prioritized for your normal summon. Add Lycoris to pull Candina back, or Lilybell to begin an offensive board set up. Lilybell becomes very powerful as Trickstar cards start to pile up in your GY; use Reincarnation's 2nd effect to capitalize on replenishing your board with Lycoris. Reincarnation can be paired with any of the virus cards, or chained before Droll &amp; Lock to shut down the opponent's hand.  Sky Strikers can provide an abundance of free resources with Hornet Drones, and Raye's self-tributing quick-effect can stack up Lair of Darkness or pull Diabolos out from the grave.  Extra Deck:  Police Patrol was made with Lair of Darkness in mind, but it isn't a terrible card overall. There are other Link-2 monsters that can better fulfill other needs, if you don't need her protective effect.  Kagari if you're going first, Hayate if you're going second.  To get Omega or Beelze out on the field, you'll need to manage your level 3 and level 4 monsters with Destrudo, or use Downbeat on Diabolos along with the Hornet token or a desperate Droll normal summon.  Side Deck:  Designed to lock out your opponent, because this deck can't beat 'em all. If swinging with full power isn't working, banish more of your opponent's key cards and chip away more of their health. Twin twisters is a superior choice for S/T removal, but this deck has only 4 target cards that can benefit from the cost.  twitch.tv/OreoGravy"
