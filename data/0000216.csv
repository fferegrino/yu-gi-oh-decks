I think it will be a link 3 that searches a trap, which, if that is the case, I would cut bubble reef.  &nbsp;  The sea nettles help to make rank 4 plays, so I've been tempted on putting in one of the cards in the side deck, which I would cut a blue slug for.

The Dark Magicians and Millennium Eyes-Restrict reprint when?","Before I get into the strategy of the deck, let's look at the most important card first: Fusion Parasite  This card can be used as a substitute for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster Card, but the other  Fusion Material(s) must be correct. Cannot be used as Fusion Metarial otherwise. If this card is Special Summons (except during the Damage Step): You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters you control as Fusion Materials including this card  This makes basically any Fusion Monster that needs a named monster along with otherwise generic requirements summonable with it as long as we can Special Summon our Parasite while controlling another monster that fulfills the other requirements.  How can we do that as often as possible: Reviving him by any means necessary. Good thing there's a lot of traps that can accomplish just that like Back to the Front, Call of the Haunted, Limit Reverse, Graceful Revival, Oasis of Dragon Souls, Powerful Rebirth and such along with Monster Reborn, Battlewasp Arbalest the Rapidfire,  Kinka-Byo and Cross-Sheep.  However, many of those traps bring the problem with them that if the revived monster isn't destroyed they will stay on the field and clog up our backrow and how do we even intend to drop our Parasite into a position where we can revive him from in the first place?  The first problem is alleviated (but sadly not completely solved...) with Magic Planter thet gets rid of a Trap to give us 2 draws which might be new cards to revive our Parasite but he's still not in the Graveyard for said revive yet.  Here come multiple other cards into play:  We can easily Special Summon our Parasite from the deck with One for One and add him to our hand with Where arf Thou? (though that is more useful with Kinka-Byo) As for ways to dump the Parasite, we have Armageddon Knight, Dark Grepher (Reinforcement of the Army to search either of them), The Mathematician, Foolish Burial and Neos Fusion (Keeper of Dragon Magic to discard Parasite or anything else and search Neos Fusion).  So we now have enough ways to get our Parasite where we want it to be but what can we do with him now?  The two easiest Fusion Targets are Elemental Hero Brave Neos and Millennium-Eyes Restrict with Millennium-Eyes Restrict being our main play which is why we also run its support cards to efficiently cycle it.  Next we have the Fusions that require Warriors plus a named monster like Dark Cavalry (just becomes HUGE with all the backrow we're playing) and Red-Eyes Slash Dragon with Slash Dragon being one of the ""ladderable"" Fusions. We can Fusion Summon often and Slash Dragon being a Dragon enables us to use it for some more advanced plays. Never thought of hearing of a ""Fusion Ladder"" outside of a dedicated archetype like Lunalights, huh?  An honourable mention goes to Shura the Combat Star if we use Brave Neos to ladder into him since he can put on some pressure by making everything 0 ATK and floating into Idaten  Then we have the Fusions that require Spellcasters (like Millennium-Eyes Restrict) plus a named monster like Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, another ladderable Dragon who's just big or the better Fusion target of this category being The Dark Magicians since they synergize REALLY well with this deck. Usually we're activating at least one backrow per turn so getting a draw out of it and if it's backrow being able to set and activate it is pretty insane. That basically equals another Fusion Summon per turn for basically no effort.  Now onto the Dragon Fusion monsters: We have Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman easy to bring out with DNA Surgery if you draw it to lock down the opponent and allow huge damage. The alternative would be Dark Magician the Dragon Knight who protects our backrow since that's the most important part of the strategy.  Link Monsters include Linkuriboh because we run our fair share of lvl 1 monsters, Cross-Sheep because it gives us a revive on Fusion Summon turning a singular Parasite Summon into 2, Seraphim Papillon because I wanted a Link 3 that was generic and it can technically revive the Parasite and Linkmail Archfiend because having a lot of Fusions is great Fodder for his effect along with him being generic as well.  Since we run Link monsters we can also play Cyberse Clock Dragon. Not necessarily for the mill but for his ability to search any spall on death and him pulling attacks at himself as long as there's a Link monster on our field which is really easy to fulfill with all the lvl 1s we revive all the time and Linkuriboh"

Dual purpose strategy: Apex Avian lockdown, combined with a synchro engine. Ideally, find Divine Wind as fast as possible, and then turbo using Harpie Dancer/Speedroids. Apex Avian can infinitely trigger with Thunderbird on the field, effectively locking down the opponent's effects. Star Staring Starling and Harpie Oracle can be used in conjunction with Swallow's Nest to drop Apex Avian onto the field. Synchro Dragons are here to also trigger Oracle's level increase, as well as generally be boss monsters. Otherwise, I'm just running tech cards to see what works."

I have and lemme tell you, unless you cheat that train won't budge an inch from it's track.</span>  <span>If you're under the age of 18, remember the time <a data-name=""Ojama Black"">Bradley</a> threw his toy train right at your face? Remember the bubu it left, how much it hurt?</span>  <span>Either of these perfectly describes Earth Machine. It can play through handtraps, has great recursion and can deal a truckload of damage - pun intended - on the follow up.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Nothing but hot air</span>  <span>It's true. Earth Machine can easily play through one or two negates, need nothing more than a single starter and have multiple ways to navigate through their combo lines. Yet even if you run full steam ahead your combo nets you exactly zero interaction. You heard that right, this rouge tier deck does exactly nothing  to your opponent. Even Dream Mirror can pop an opponent's monster every ten games.</span>  <span>Yet this deck amasses you a lot of ressources. Remember Salamangreat? Of course you do, it's only the best deck. Technically, the Gazelle combo line nets you exactly one piece of interruption. One trap, that's all. But when was the last time you saw Salamangreat do nothing but activate one trap card? It's similar with Earth Machines. The combo draws you two cards, sets up your ressources and every card that is not a starter or extender is exactly that, interaction. You'll either start with interruption in your opening hand or draw into it.</span>  <span>And it's not just the obvious cards like <span><a data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a></span>. If you open <span><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a></span> (also your target for Overdrive) you can send it with <span><a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a></span> to  have it live in the GY or use <span><a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a></span> to add Citadel to hand or keep the Redeployment until after you've drawn two in case you drew into a Machina card to then add Overdrive. There's plenty of ways to end on interruption and all of these are crazy strong.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Next stop, Drawtown. Population: Two.</span>  <span>Catchy name, isn't it? As for the combo you have twelve starters.</span> <span><a data-name=""Machina Metalcruncher"">Machina Metalcruncher</a></span> <span>(searched by</span> <span><a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a></span><span>) and</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a></span> <span>(searched by</span> <span><a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a></span><span>).</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Starter adds</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Summon Dozer and with his effect</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Trencher"">Infinitrack Trencher</a></span> <span>(Tunneller works, too but Trencher can extend in the GY so you want access to him as early as possible.

If you open it it's best to summon it after Dozer's summon to 'chainblock' its effect), then send Gear Box to summon Bullet Train and overlay them into <span><a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</a></span>, detaching Bullet Train. </span></li>  	<li><span>Bullet Train in GY will trigger in the EP adding you back the Gear Box or Dozer or whichever one you like best.</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>During your opponent's turn you use Anger Knuckle to summon Bullet Train again to trigger it in EP, adding back the Box, triggering the Box to add</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Deck Disassemble</span>  <span>No I did not google how to spell disassemble. Yes I totally knew the difference between that one and dissemble.</span>  <span>Little about the Extra Deck: Knightmare Phoenix is there to have generic link material, which can be of help sometimes. <span><a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a></span> can easily be summoned off of Anchor Drill's level modulation and Box, summoned off of Anchor Drill. <span><a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a></span> can be summoned with Anchor Drill and Harvester (or Box and Harvester). It's there to send Overdrive the the GY if you don't have it in rotation. That recycles the banished Tunneller and Trencher, allowing more flexiblity turn 2 onwards.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></span> is great since you only need one card for your combo, although the combo itself does not OTK. But depending on the cards sent with Droplet you could end on a r10nk or have access to a r9nk to either wipe your opponent's board or OTK through it. However you could play other cards instead. Either three <span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></span> or a <span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></span> and another <span><a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a></span> or more trains should suffice.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a></span> is there in anticipation of Swordsoul, which will be legal at the upcoming YCS. If you side into <span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></span> be mindful that you cannot summon Bullet Train if you control a monster that is not EARTH Machine. However you can send it with Anger Knuckle at the end of your combo rid yourself of it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>A little treat for the journey ahead</span>  If you like Machines, Mechs and/or Manga: Trust me, read Heart Gear. Even if you don't like Mechs and Machines (although I doubt you've made it this far then) this is such a great Manga. The author got sick so it only has 29 chapters as of now but it's such a great piece of work. The artstyle is fantastic, using a lot of shading and grids to create astounding images. The story is captivating and interesting. It's one of my all time favorites and I thought this decklist is probably best suited to recommend it. Do yourself a favor and check it out. (In case this is not allowed: Hi mod, you're you doing? I've been great thanks for asking. Before you say anything, go ahead and give it a read. I'll take this section down if you still want me to by the end of chapter 29)"

Have you ever wanted to give your Deck Dysentery only to then profit off of it by banishing the poor souls in the Graveyard for your own personal Greed, only to be Ash Blossom'd? You like Bricks? Then Boy oh Boi do I have the Deck for you!  Ok in all seriousness, It's not THAT bad, it can, as mentioned before, swarm the board with lots of cards to go into Extra Deck Plays.  This Deck's Goal is mainly to get Soldier of Chaos out with a Level 7, in order to smack your opponent in the face with a non-targetable beatSTICKK, which can either gain more ATK, a free banish or a second attack on the NEXT TURN on kill.  Chaos Ruler is here because he fits the theme of C H A O S and he can used to extend plays, reusable extra deck fodder or just as another beatSTICKK.  Utopia is here in case the Heart of the Cards has a bad day and decides to cuck you, in which case you go from Utopia to Utopia Prime AND THEN Utopia the Lighting for the sake of haveing 4 material, 2 of which are Utopia cards (Because effect). oh and Zeus... he's here too.  Kuribohble is here because he is cute, DARK Attribute and for the sake of being a kuriboh (but better).  Levianeer because why not? BLS because its FUCKEN BLS, and Lightsworn because this trainwreck needs an engine. (I dont know any other good engines that work here, dont crucify me)  so yeah... that is...that.  You'll figure the rest out, somehow... Try not to get stomped by the Meta!"

Better going first. The fusion traps are your main iniciator and therizia sets them from de,"*UPDATED POST DIFO*  Besides its a trap deck i dont feel necesary Lord of the Heavenly Prison since your main interactions happens at opponents main phase.  I prefer pot of duality in front of Porperity because sometimes the Extra Deck is a bit empty due to Dinomorphia Frenzy and the copy effect of Kentregina. On the other hand if you summoned Enforcer by his effect Duality cannot resolve so keep it in mind.  Ferret Flames is with Dinomorphia Rexstrum your better deffense.  Daigusto Emeral is a great card when you have all your material monsters in graveyard and you need recycle plus attack with Rexstrum effect and then summon Zeus over Daigusto. You can recycle all the Enforcer package too.  Torrential Tribute plays very positive since it can reniniciate the Dinomorphia effect monsters at the oponent's turn.  The main strategy with this deck is to play agressively fusion summoning at oponent's main phase while you reduce your life point to less than 2000, 1000 the better if you summon Rexstrum.  &nbsp;"

All in all this deck can beat the Meta decks very easy and you should give it a try.  For last updates you can consider <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> in the main for TTT. But TTT works also perfectly in the deck so only change it if you already have the Pots and you dont have Talents.  Tell me what you think about the current version of the deck.

If you need to get rid of some spell or trap, synchro into Wind Pegasus @Ignister instead of Winter Bell then after have activated his destruction effect, proceed with the combo as normally.  This is my first time using Windwitch engine so i might be missing some really good card but this way works fine too.  I'm using King of the Sky Prison in the side deck because he can protect all your traps (opponent traps too) and give you a free search together with a respectable 3000 atk beatstick.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

OK, I gotta say, I really like this deck. I love the cybernetic and dinosaur-inspired designs of the monsters, as well as the nighttime city setting in the artwork! I think I could see some kanji in Therizia's artwork background.  &nbsp;  *Ahem* Anyways, this is my Dinoruffia deck. It mainly uses a pure build, but also has a small engine of 3 Solemn Judgment and 3 Solemn Strike. Dinoruffia Therizia is better for starting your plays off, because she sets a Trap from your deck. Your strategy should be to summon Kentregina as quickly as you can, and either disrupt your opponent's players or extend your own using your Trap cards.  &nbsp;  As for the title, I just couldn't think of a better name for this deck than ""Kamen Rider Tyranno.""

Turn 2: The 1 and a half card Cyberdark combo can be used to deal over 12,000 damage to the opponent, so start with this combo to bait out potential disruption, as if the opponent does nothing, you almost always win on the spot.

""Shaddoll Fusion"" is a great going second option that can gain you lots of advantage by acting as a triple foolish burial. They also provide a lot of utility, with there being a different effect for every situation.  Invoked: The power of the Invoked monsters, from ""Invoked Mechaba"" being able to negate almost anything, ""Invoked Raidjin"" being able to flip monsters face-down and stop crucial synchro, xyz or link summons and re-use Shaddoll flip monsters, and ""Invoked Purgatrio"" which can destroy well-established boards in an instant. This is all helped by the fact that ""Aleister the Invoker"" can come back to hand every turn and do the combo again and again.  Dogmatika: ""Dogmatika Punishment"" is an incredibly powerful card that can pop 2 cards on the field, and by using ""Dogmatika, Ecclesia the Virtuous"", it allows ""Dogmatika Punishment"" to be searched by ""Nadir Servant"". ""Nadir Servant"" is also an incredibly powerful card, acting as a 1 card ""El Shaddoll Winda"" and a monster negate. Activate ""Nadir Servant""; send ""El Shaddoll Apkallone"" from the extra deck to the GY to add ""Dogmatika Maximus"" from your deck to your hand. This will activate the ability of ""El Shaddoll Apkallone"", to allow you to add to your hand and then discard ""Shaddoll Schism"". Special summon ""Dogmatika Maximus"" and activate its effect; send ""El Shaddoll Construct"" and ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"" from your extra-deck to the GY. Use the effect of ""El Shaddoll Construct"" and add back ""Shaddoll Schism"" from your GY to your hand and set it. During the end phase; activate the ability of ""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"" to add ""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"" from your deck to your hand. This combo also provides a lot of versatility, as cards such as ""Elder Entity N'tss"" and ""Albion the Branded Dragon"" can be sent to the GY to destroy cards or to make use of the Despia engine.  Despia: The power of the fusion monster ""Despian Quaeritis"" itself justifies the use of this engine, as being able to stop opponent's monsters being able to beat over more vunerable monsters you control is very useful. In addition to this, it is very easy to summon due to ""Aluber, Jester of Despia"", which can immedietly add the fusion spell from your deck to the hand, and recurs itself when a fusion is destroyed, and then on top negates a monster's effects.

Cards such as ""Old Vindictive Magician"" and ""Exiled Force"" provide ways to out opponent's challenging monsters. With the power of traps, ""Jinzo"" both neutralises trap decks and acts as a 2400 beater.  Spells: Many spells are here for consistency, such as ""Reinforcement of the Army"", and to grab cards that can work in any situation. ""Heavy Storm"" and ""Giant Trunade"" act as backrow removal, and allow easy damage with the Chaos monsters. ""Snatch Steal"" and ""Brain Control"" can utilise the most powerful monsters the opponent may summon and use them against them.  Traps: These traps are all very high impact on the opponent's field, and result in huge gains in card advantage and easy damage for OTKs.  Side Deck: ""Skill Drain"", ""Spell Canceller"" and ""Royal Decree"" are useful against monster, spell and trap heavy decks respectively. Cards such as ""Injection Fairy Lily"" and ""Creature Swap"" help for dealing a lot of damage.  Weaknesses: Stall decks that inflict lots of burn damage (sometimes difficult to out their protection in the form of ""Swords of Revealing Light"" or ""Level Limit - Area B"")"

VRAINS anime. The archetype displays some similarities with ""Trickstars"", which has also been used by Skye. Nearly all the members are humanoid females dressing in colorful idol-like attires (each using a shade of blue somewhere), inspired by, and incorporating accessories based on, the physical traits of sea creatures (several of which being poisonous ones). Main Deck monsters tend to be younger girls, while Link Monsters are often older women.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Link to use this deck :</p> <p dir=""ltr"">https://youtu.be/watch?v=_9mWSRhHpyk</p>"
