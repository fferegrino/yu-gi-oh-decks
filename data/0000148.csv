Link a la demostraci√≥n del Deck: https://youtu.be/DTn1bJ1bDmk  Extenders para iniciar el combo: <ul>  	<li>Tour guide from the underworld: Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo env√≠as al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li>Fiendish rhino warrior: Vale x2. Env√≠a al cementerio el mismo target que la Tour guide, aunque no aprovecha el cuerpo extra. Necesita otro extender s√≠ o s√≠.</li>  	<li>Junk forward: Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li>Kagemucha knight: Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li>Psychic wheelder: Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque s√≥lo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li>Psychic tracer: Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li>Gilasaurus: Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li>Fossil dig: Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li>Foolish burial: Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots o Brigandine, o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li>  	<li>Emergency teleport: Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li> </ul> Inicio del combo: <ol>  	<li>Primero, se debe traer a Cherubini y activar su efecto. No importa si es negado, ya que lo importante es el costo de enviar al cementerio a Graff para invocar del Deck a Cir (Ojo, si Cherubini mantiene sus efectos negados, Cir se destruir√° si tenemos otros monstruos, as√≠ que cuidado).</li>  	<li>Hacemos link summon con cherubini y Cir, con lo que se activar√° el efecto de este √∫ltimo y as√≠ invocaremos nuevamente a Cherubini. El monstruo link que invocaremos depender√° de la ruta que elijamos, la cual a su vez depende de cu√°ntos extenders tengamos disponibles.</li> </ol> Ruta segura (N√∫mero de extenders iniciales requerido: 4+. Monstruo: Apollousa): <ol>  	<li>Al tener 2 extenders extra adem√°s de los usados para invocar a Cherubini, usaremos un material link m√°s para ir por Apollousa. Opcionalmente si hay m√°s extenders, se le puede invocar con 4 materiales para tener las 4 negaciones, pero siempre dejando 1 para el siguiente paso. Tambi√©n es importante no poner demasiados cuerpos, ya que m√°s tarde van a estorbar.</li>  	<li>Con el extender sobrante y el Cherubini revivido por el efecto de Cir, invocaremos por link a Codebreaker virus swordsman, colinkeado a Apollousa. Esto activar√° el efecto de invocar del Deck a Codebreaker zero day.</li>  	<li>Ahora procederemos a invocar a Codebreaker berserker usando los dos codebreaker, siempre en el medio para invocar de vuelta los otros 2 a ambos lados usando su efecto.</li>  	<li>Usamos a los codebreaker link para invocar a Isolde. A√±adimos cualquier descarte e invocamos a Armageddon knight. Para los equipos a descartar, es importante enviar Phoenix blade (combo guerrero), Sword of sparkles (ya ver√°n) y Cursed bamboo sword (para a√±adirnos una magia a la mano).</li>  	<li>Armageddon enviar√° al cementerio a Summoner monk, y usaremos a Armageddon y Codebreaker zero day para obtener a Dugares y as√≠ invocarlo de vuelta. Es importante que ambos monstruos sean invocados donde NO apunta Apollousa.</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Phoenix blade para desterrar a dos guerreros cualquiera para a√±adirlo a la mano y lo descartamos como el coste del Summoner monk para invocar al Rescue ferret.</li>  	<li>Nos deshacemos de Isolde con el efecto de Sword of sparkles en el cementerio y activamos el efecto de Ferret para traer a Speedroid red-eyed dice, Plaguespreader zombie y a Edge imp sabres o Phantom knights of silent boots (dependiendo si ya hemos usado uno o el otro, si no cualquier otro no tuner estar√° bien, pero tendremos un cuerpo menos para sacrificar m√°s adelante)</li>  	<li>Invocamos por sincron√≠a a Rose maiden con el Plaguespreader y el monstruo de nivel 3 que elegimos para obtener el Black garden. Traemos nuevamente el Plaguespreader con su efecto para invocar nuevamente por sincron√≠a al Shooting riser dragon.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto del Riser dragon enviamos al cementerio el World legacy - world chalice en nuestro Deck (en realidad cualquier World legacy de nivel 6 o menor est√° bien) y activamos el Black garden.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Flame swordsman usando a Summoner monk y el Speedroid dice, tras lo cual activaremos el Black garden y traeremos de vuelta al Summoner monk.</li>  	<li>Usamos el efecto de Phoenix blade para traerla a la mano por segunda vez (deber√≠a quedar por lo menos un guerrero en el cementerio todav√≠a) y la usamos como coste del Summoner monk para traer el Pathfinder.</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Pathfinder para traer a la mano el Lair of darkness (el cual activaremos) e invocamos a Lib usando al Summoner monk y el Flame swordsman.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto de Lib colocaremos el World legacy succession y nuevamente traeremos al Summoner monk.</li>  	<li>Traeremos por √∫ltima vez el Phoenix blade desterrando el guerrero que quedaba y el Flame swordsman, y lo usamos de costo para el Summoner monk para traer a Shadowpriestess of ohm.</li>  	<li>Usando el efecto de Ohm nos desharemos de Lib y Dugares (1600) y usaremos al Summoner monk junto con el Riser dragon para invocar a Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Con Halqifibrax traemos al Speedroid den-den y usamos a ambos para invocar a Auroradon y activar su efecto, con lo que tendremos un link y 3 fichas para sacrificar con Ohm (1600 + 3200 = 4800).</li>  	<li>Para el resto, usaremos el efecto de Rose maiden para traer el Riser dragon, el efecto de Speedroid den-den para traer al Speedroid dice y el efecto de la carta de nivel 3 que elegimos (si es Sabres, se invoca solo; si es Silent boots, traemos a Brigandine y lo invocamos) (4800 + 800 + 800 + 800 = 7200)</li>  	<li>Para el √∫ltimo monstruo podemos usar a Apollousa o a la misma Ohm (7200 + 800 = 8000). GG. Si por alguna raz√≥n usaste a Sabres y Boots al inicio y te faltan 2 sacrificios, puedes usar ambos (Apollousa y Ohm).</li> </ol> Ruta parcialmente segura (N√∫mero de extenders iniciales requerido: 3. Monstruo: Tenyi) <ol>  	<li>A diferencia de la primera ruta, s√≥lo tenemos un extender adicional que debemos guardar para el codebreaker, as√≠ que usaremos solamente a Cherubini y Cir para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>El resto va igual hasta llegar al paso 7 de la ruta segura. En este punto, en lugar de activar el efecto de Sword of sparkles, usaremos a Isolde junto con Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa.</li>  	<li>El combo contin√∫a igual hasta el final.</li> </ol> Tips: <ul>  	<li>Apollousa es √∫til para sacar del juego casi cualquier handtrap, aprovechando que Impermanence ya no se usa mucho y que Called est√° a 1 copia (por ahora 7w7)</li>  	<li>Edge imp sabres y Plaguespreader zombie pueden usarse para enviar garnets en tu mano de vuelta al Deck.

Are you a Yugi-Boomer (like me) who just want simple unga bunga smackdown caveman Yu-Gi-Oh? This dec,"Tried of boring combos and brain numbing dueling? Are you a Yugi-Boomer (like me) who just want simple unga bunga smackdown caveman Yu-Gi-Oh? Excited to break your opponent's board that they so lovingly crafted the last 10 minutes with their ridiculously long cardplay (zzzZZZzzz)? Wanna obliterate your opponent with an oldschool 15 year old card in one single attack? Gren Maju OTK is the perfect deck for you!  &nbsp;  Popularized by the venerable <em>Yishan McNabb</em> nearly two years ago by gaining second place in YCS August 2019 during the infamous control heavy ""TOSS"" format, this Gren Maju OTK made a surprising splash as a rogue meta contender ever since.  &nbsp;  This deck focuses on the straight forward strategy banishment into one shot kill with a ridiculously OMEGA-POWERFUL high attack <span><strong>Gren Maju De Eiza</strong></span>, who gains 400 attack from everyone of your banished cards. This deck is best-tailored with cards and engines best enable this simple strategy.  &nbsp;  <span>This deck features <span><strong>3 packages that feature level 8 monsters</strong> </span>that pair nicely with Trade-In (Discard lvl8 for +2 draw) and allows rank 8 plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Danger! Package</strong> are composed of absolute chonkers that special summon themselves from the hand and a +1 draw if special summoned successfully with their effect - given if you're lucky. If they get discarded with their own effect, they destroy a card on the field. <strong>Danger! Bigfoot</strong> destroys face-up cards, while <strong>Danger! Thunderbird</strong> destroys face-downs. They have incredible synergy with Trade-In, not only you get a +2 draw when you discard a Danger! monster, you get to destroy a card on the field!  <strong>Golden Castle Package</strong> features the field spell <strong>Golden Castle of Stromberg</strong>, which simultaneously destroys attacking monsters for burn damage and special summons from the deck <strong>Hexe Trude</strong> (level 8 with 1 destruction per turn) and <strong>Glife the Phantom Bird</strong> (Golden Castle searcher and backrow destruction). Golden Castle also banishes 10 cards from your maindeck everyturn, additionally boosting Gren Maju's attack! Funnily with Golden Castle on the field, opponents usually never read the additional card text on it and still foolishly attack with their monsters - blowing up their monster for delicious burn damage!  <strong>Kaiju Package</strong> are one of your ultimate board breaking tools! Tribute away their invincible towers (I'm looking at you Dragoon &gt;:c) or their annoying quick effect monster (I hate you Altergeist Silquitous)! Our monsters of choice are the level 8 <strong>Gameciel</strong> (chosen for its relatively low 2200 attack, making OTKs slightly easier) and <strong>Gadarla</strong>. <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> clears an entire field of monsters as long as there is a copy of Gameciel and Gadarla in the still in the deck. Try to use this before you banish your main deck so you don't accidentally banish your kaijus!  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Field Equalizers</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  As a dedicated going second deck, deck features field equalizers that obliterate your opponent's field to wipe away all opposition, so that Gren Maju De Eiza can annihilate!  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> is The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing) and it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or attack position monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second and the gren maju player will have plenty of opportunity to use this card because their field will mostly be empty. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Hole (still not quite the same or as powerful unfortunately, hope this card gets reprinted soon).  <strong>Raigeki</strong> is a great card and requires no explanation, smash your opponent's monsters!  <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> clears an entire field of monsters as long as there is a copy of Gameciel and Gadarla in the still in the deck. Try to use this before you banish your main deck so you don't accidentally banish your kaijus!  <strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong> is the only non-spell card featured in the board breaking line-up. It is a dedicated going-second card that puts a free body on board, and it can tribute itself to destroy any card on the field.  For backrow heavy decks, exchange cards in your deck like<strong> Twin Twisters</strong> or <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>. (For example, you won't need kaijus as much vs. Mystic Mine, so replace the entire kaiju package with backrow hate like this.) Other cards like Gizmek Orochi and Hexe Trude provide singular card destruction as well to assist with board breaking. If something is particularly difficult to get rid of, Dingirsu can send a card from the field to the GY.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Banishment Enablers</strong></span>  &nbsp;  Gren Maju feeds on the souls of the banished to boost his attack by 400 for every banished card! We have several cards that banish en masse in this deck to serve their Banished Emperor, Gren Maju.  <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> is almost a free +2 draw for Gren Maju players, boosting his attack by 4000 everytime this card is used. Careful about banishing important parts of your packages, it may render some cards like Golden Castle of Stromberg or Interrupted Kaiju Slumber un-useable.  <strong>Eater of Millions</strong> in addition to having a badass name, it also is a force to be reckoned with for every monster it battles. Its attack features non-targeting banishment, serving as a out to meta threats like Dragoon! It has unusual protection too, and it cannot be used as material for fusion so it cannot be removed with Super Poly! It can get pretty big, gaining+100 attack for every facedown banished card so it can hit over big targets. A favourite play of mine is banishing my entire extra deck, netting +6000 attack for Gren Maju!  <strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher</strong> functions as an excellent banishment tool because it banishes cards as a cost for it's effects, further boosting Gren Maju De Eiza's attack. It can also serve as a body shield when you're in a pinch, because it can summon itself from the graveyard as a quick effect. Orochi assists with rank 8 plays. If this card is XYZ material for a rank 8, detach it first so it can resurrect itself for the GY! To top it all off, Orochi can destroy a face-up monster on the field for the low cost 3 banished extra deck cards!  <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong> is arguably the strongest and most underrated hand trap, shutting off graveyard access for both players by banishing every card sent to the graveyard until the end of next turn it is activated. Almost every deck is reliant on the GY nowadays, and Dimension Shifter effectively shuts them down. If you see this guy in your opening hand, the duel's momentum is yours for a while, giving you plenty of space and time to OTK with Gren Maju!  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  &nbsp;  The extra deck serves not only as fodder to summon Eater of Millions, it is full of toolbox options for your rank 8 plays, as well as link plays as you swarm the board with a ton of special summons.  The terrific trio of the ""Number Dragons"" <strong>Number 97: Draglubion, Number 38: Hope Harbinger</strong> and <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong> provide a lot of utility and usage of the multiple level 8 monsters in this deck. Draglubion also enables the easy summon of Hope Harbinger and Numeron Dragon. Hope Harbinger is terrific going first, as it allows for a spell negate. An even more powerful play going second is clearing the board then summoning Numeron Dragon off Draglubion and hitting for 9000ATK! If Gren Maju is inaccessible, Numeron Dragon is this deck's secondary way to OTK.  <strong>Number 68: Sanaphond</strong> is also another going first option, shutting off GY summons until the end of the opponent's turn. Personally, I hardly ever make this card. It may serve to stifle the occasional deck that loves GY summons like Salamangreat or Zombies.  <strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong> is simultaneously a great removal option and blanket protection from destruction. A good play I like to do with this guy is protecting Golden Castle of Stromberg by using Hexe Trude + another level 8 as material just to stall until I draw the perfect card.  The link monsters<strong> Knightmare Unicorn/Phoenix</strong> provide target removal. The Topologic duo of <strong>Zeroboros</strong> and <strong>Trisbaena</strong> provide banishment removal, and is best triggered by summoning Gizmek Orochi during your opponent's turn. <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> is a great way to make use of the high level monsters on your field to provide his extra protection and is a great boss monster.  &nbsp;  Link 1 monsters <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and <strong>Relinquished Anima</strong> provide a way for level 1 Eater of Millions more utility. A great way to use Relinquished Anima is to suck up the kaiju you summoned to your opponent's field to further clear their field.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  &nbsp;  The side deck features cards that destroy the current meta. Change it according to how the meta changes. The best cards to switch out of this deck are the Kaiju and Golden Castle packages. Switch them out as needed verses particular decks. For example vs. combo (ex. Virtual World), you switch in <strong>Nibiru</strong>. Verses decks that love to banish (ex. dino) you switch in <strong>Artifact Lancea</strong>. Against decks that use heavy backrow (ex. Eldlich) trade in <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> and <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster.</strong> The <strong>Psy-Frame Gamma Package</strong> also provides a lot of utility with this deck as well, especially when you want to negate + destroy an important choke point (ex. Halqifibrax/Isolde).  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Final Comments</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  This deck is definitely strong, but it does have it's weaknesses. It really has no strong going first play, and you can only hope that your opponent does not OTK you on the following turn. If you don't manage to OTK your opponent, this deck has little to no ability to grind out a game - once you run out of resources, you deck yourself out because you banished everything you own.  This deck is super fun and easy to play. It has highly potent board breaking capabilities, it is very consistent, and high game-ending attack on board is easy to achieve. Games are finished quickly, it is relatively stress free, and it's pretty straightforward. I highly recommend bringing this if it is your first time in locals and you are worried you may misplay from nervousness or something. There is something super satisfying beating your opponent to a pulp with one singular attack with a super-powerful monster, which hearkens memories of simple caveman Yu-Gi-Oh from ancient times.  &nbsp;  Good luck have fun duelists! o7"

If you have Great Sand Sea and a Springans monster (or Springans Watch to search either) in your hand, you're set! Use Great Sand Sea to XYZ summon Ship, attach the Springans as material per their effect, detach them to target a zone, and boom! Board broken. The Scrap engine helps with consistency. Using it to send Springans to the graveyard is helpful because they can attach to Ship from the GY. It's also useful to spam out effect monsters as Anaconda mats for the Dragoon engine, if you choose to main that. Zeus works with mostly every XYZ strategy, and adds another board wipe."

Freeze Bell because some time Glass Bell will bricked your hand. Use her and Glass to get Clear Wing.  3. Invoked Raidjin because he can be play with Windbitch.  4. Do not forget to use Aleister ON THE FIELD to get other things out before going to Invocation.  5. Magicians' Soul to get Mana or DMG to GY then use them as u like.  6. Magicians' Soul to recycle Meltdown after u get your fusion.  7. Always Silent Magician on Aleister.  8. Quintet Magician is your go-to trump card.  9. Fortune Lady Every because she is cute.  10. If u have all 5 Windwitches on your board it can end up with 1 Clear Wing and 1 Diamond Bell.  11. Artemis purpose is to link away for Invoked Mechaba.  I would love to add 1 Magi Magi * Magician Gal but she is not available in TCG (but I play her in my physical copy deck anyway.)  Magicians' Soul is dirt cheap in OCG. Damn You Konami!!!  PS.

The idea is here, and you can do what you want with this. This is not even close to the full potential this deck could obtain. I know this isn't the best deck to come back with after months of inactivity, but it's the most original idea I have at the moment.  Okay, with that disclaimer out of the way, here's the premiss.  I've been a longtime fan of Tenyi builds. They can play around Nibiru, Gamma and Impermanence with relative ease and don't use up your Normal Summon. For this reason, things like Lava Golem, Invoked and other normal-summon heavy engines work quite well with it. The Tenyi normal deck monsters are also all different Attributes, lending itself pretty well to both Shaddoll and Invoked fusion monsters. So, I thought, why not? Lets make a Tenyi Invoked deck.  Some things right off the bat: you almost always want to used your invoked engine AFTER your done with Tenyis. That way, you can use whatever Tenyi's you want in your fusion summons. There's also a neat little combo you can pull off with the Tenyi search spell, any Tenyi monster and a way to get Aleister (I'll detail that later). You won't be normal summoning Aleister until late into your turn, after all your Tenyi plays. Even when Nibiru is played, you should be able to end on a Sahasrara and/or an Invoked monster, if you get either Aleister or the field spell.  A few problems with the deck as it is: there are hardly any negates (you typically won't be getting SAVAGE first turn, if ever, and Mechaba is only 1), feeble draw power (someone will figure out that one, also I'm lazy and didn't imput Desires, so that is a viable option. Prosperity is only useful because you can choose what to banish, but generally your Extra Deck is necessary), lack of removal, and a lack of viable floodgate bypasses (pretty much anything will kill it). The power of the deck is underwhelming as it is, but this can be ammended in future installations. Let me know what you think!  Here's the combo for you: <ol>  	<li>Special Summon whatever Tenyi you have</li>  	<li>Link to Monk</li>  	<li>Activate <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a>, mill Mare Mare, add Ashuna or Adhara or Mapura (depending on what Invoked you want)</li>  	<li>Special Summon the Tenyi you have</li>  	<li>Link to Shaman</li>  	<li>Special Summon Mare Mare from grave using Shaman. Use Mare Mare to get 2 (or 3) tokens.</li>  	<li>Link Shaman and 2 (or 3) tokens to Ashuna</li>  	<li>Use Mare to get another token to make him Lvl. 4 if you haven't already</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Aleister, adding Invocation (if necessary, get the field spell to search him out)</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Draco Berserker using Mare Mare and Aleister (SAVAGE won't activate because of Shaman)</li>  	<li>Use Invocation to bring out appropriate Invoked (you usually want to go for Mechaba, since it's a negate).</li> </ol>"

This deck aims to handloop for 2 while still ending on Borreload Savage, it means we already took care 3 cards out of 6 cards opponent has. There are 2 lines of combo to achieve that, watch the video. If from Paradox Gear, we can handloop for 2 every turn because Paradigm Dragon will still be on field unlike using Machina Redeployment as starter.
