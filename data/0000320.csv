After taking this to locals and getting the advice of many experienced Runick players I ended on this list. You need to have 17-19 Runick Quick Play Spells in order to have consistent draws off of Runick Fountain. The main strategy is to switch between both Runick and Sky Striker cards to control the gamestate. The Runick cards should not only be used to control the game, but to summon Runick monsters from the extra deck to stop an opponents attack. You will be winning most of the time by decking out your opponent but you can also win by killing your opponent with Sky Striker monsters and especially BLS which most decks cannot out.&nbsp;</p>"

Rogue or Stun, decks that can take on the meta need to be made in order to put a check in the game. However as we learned many times, Tier-0 decks can exist regardless of their weaknesses. Which is why today I rather ""exported"" an interesting Stun deck from the Eastern Hemisphere. The card ""Fary Tail - Luna"" is a card while on the field can return any monster (and itself) to the hand (unless it can't ve targeted). Then there is the Kaiju archetype: an archetype that can have one monster be tributed on your opponents side, and special summoned on your side. What synergy do they have? TL;DR give a Kaiju to your opponent, summon Luna, and return both of them to your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The twist with this however is that I am also running the Runick engine. I'm not gonna go into details about them, but the archetype has spells that have Kino effects in exchange for giving up your battle phase. Alongside a field spell that plays them from your hand anytime and recovers them from the GY to the deck, Runick has a lovely will spot in the Yu-Gi-Oh Stun Deck lore. How I combined all three of them is by using the Kaijus and ""Fairy Tail - Luna"" to destabilize your opponents board, and using the Runick spells to your best use and to mill resources from your opponents deck.</p>"

Getting two Recital Starlings out will get you two more Lyrilusc, and when you finish with both of them, you can use them both to go into Utopic Future and Utopic Draco Future; Assembled Nightingale can deal damage and protect your other Lyrilusc from destruction/effects; Ensemblue Robin can floodgate a few Special Summons; Promenade Thrush can take care of Traps/Spells as well as provide a boost to Attack when you want to push for game. Tri-Brigade just helps cycle through your deck and can act as backup if your board gets wiped by using their ability to go into their Link monsters. If you want to win more, send one of your XYZs into Zeus during Main 2 to ensure your opponent's board gets wiped. Evil Thorn just gives you a free Rank 1 XYZ if its ability goes through in exchange for your Normal Summon, although possibly without the protection that using your Lyrilusc cards give.</p><p>Obviously going first is optimal, but if you go second and your opponent doesn't have ways to stop your summoning, you can pretty easily OTK. Go into Assembled Nightingale with as many materials as possible and attack for as much as possible. If your opponent has a big body like BEWD or Dark Magician, or if you're on Game 2 with a Kaiju on your opponent's side, you can crash Recital Starling.</p><p>For Side Deck, you've got your hand traps and other removal if you want to counterpick based on what your opponent is using. Also using a high-attack Kaiju rather than Gameciel, since you can crash Recital Starling into it for very high damage.</p>"

They were designed to be easy to understand and balanced within each other. They share 11 generic cards, each with a specific functionality in order to give the decks a way out of roadblocks, as well as an introduction to each different card type. The shared cards are 4 Spell cards (Tribute to The Doomed, De-Spell, Monster Reincarnation and Banner of Courage) and 7 Trap cards (Jar of Greed, Dust Tornado, Trap Hole, Magic Jammer, Seven Tools of The Bandit and Birthright).</p><p>They're thematic to each duelist but some of their iconic cards are not present in order to balance these decks properly.</p><p>They were initially made to be a choice (between the 3) to the player, at the start of a videogame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is Joey's Deck.</p><p>It has even distribution of Monster, Spell and Trap cards.</p><p>This is the only deck that slightly diverges from its user's iconic cards, since they're either too useful or not so helpful. It contains cards from other duelists that Joey has beaten.

It has an extremely favorable mashup against both Labirynth and Kashtira, and has mechanics that are very hard to play around for nearly every deck. P.u.n.k. Pride is skillful and is not just a 1 card pony trick that can easily be thwarted by negates. It's the perfect deck for those that want a differnt choice this 02/2023 TCG Format.<br /><br />This deck list is ""Loosely"" based off of a list made by MBT for one of his Ten Minute Testing videos. However, for this build i did make some changes, as i did not like some of the card choices when doing playtesting:<br /><br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Dangerous Gabu: When running the deck, i found myself never really wanting to draw this card or use it.<br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Madame Spider: Since we are running no P.U.N.K Traps, we have no need to run this card.</p><p>- Psy-Frame Negate Package (x3 Psy-Frame Gear Beta + x1 Psy-Frame Driver): Drive is such a bad garnet, and i found that ash blossom worked much better here.

The main issue that P.u.n.k Pride has is the high ratio of Tuners to Non Tuners.

I know certian builds are running 2-3 copies as E-tele targets but they tend to brick as trhe deck does not need more tuners. This in future may just become another ash blossom.<br /><br />In the extra, i cut nearly all of the Link Monsters, keeping only Gold Pride Star Nytro Head. When playtesting, i never went into any of the Links, and i rarely ever go into Star Nytro head. Star Nytro Head does have purpose for being fodder for Carrie's ability, and making Star Leon bigger, but depending on whether new support comes out in may, this card may or may not stay in the deck.<br /><br />I also removed some of the Synchros, and swapped them out for either more copies of&nbsp; key pieces (+ x1 <a class=""type-synchro-monster"" href=""/card/?search=60465049"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/60465049.jpg"" data-card=""60465049"" data-name=""Psychic End Punisher"">Psychic End Punisher</span></a> ) to help combat against Kashtira, or swapped out for cards that provided some more utiliity:</p><p>+ x1 Crystron Phoenix as an out against Labrynth Decks. Summon this to blank their backrow and graveyard, assuming they have no already activated Skill Drain. This is an effect that could see increased value if the new 1 card Super Heavy Samurai combo takes off in the TCG like it has in the OCG.this also marginally good against other decks, but is not the main goto.</p><p>+ x1 Stellar WInd Wolfrayet as an out against Kashtira. This is not super easy to go into, but non-targeting shuffle into deck is extremely poweful and very few if any decks can actually play around it. The effect is very easy to pull off as most decks need to activate 4-5 effects minimum to get into anything meaningful. And P.u.n.k. Pride can easily take the game on the crackback.<br /><br />+ x1 Hyper Psychic Riser...

This in essence could be any level 6 synchro, but this one does have some annoying properties that can make it hard for cards to go off, and is one of those cards that hurts your opponents more than it hurts you. Also, this can be an intermediary to level 9 synchros if needed. Technically,. if your store/group allowed it, you could run the Japanese Copy from Duel Disk Yusei, which on Ebay is ~$20 USD, bu your deck would not be tournament legal.<br /><br />The sideboard is subjective, and was largely just based off of the existing board list MBT made.

Not the craziest or most well constructed deck or whatever but I think it's fun! Many discard to draw cards to get your monsters in the GY so you can start summoning your Necrofears! Venom dragons are used also to get more monsters in the GY just like Wee Witch's Apprentice and generally I just simply found them to be super useful monsters to have on the field. Your Necrofears have plenty of card removal on their own and Curse Necrofear's removal gets better with more Destiny Board Letters on the field! I would appreciate some advice or critique on this deck! All comments are appreciated and I thank you for the time you spent checking this deck out!</p>

A lot has changed since last time.</p><p>Handtrap line up consists of Nibiru, purely because it's one of the best handtraps to deal with Kashtira provided they don't run Iblee/Crossout/Adventurer. And still has utility against anything Bystial/Dragon Link related. Ash Blossom is also a must i feel. Being able to deal with cards such as Branded Fusion is absolutely key, and Impermenence because of it sheer utility.&nbsp;</p><p>The Striker engine itself doesn't really need to be explained too much, as pretty much everybody who has played in the last few years is more than aware of what it can do. Linkage is an awesome addition to the deck allowing you to kill off your opponent a lot faster making the deck less reliant on the Accesscode Talker package to close out games. Pot Of Prosperity, Avarice, ROTA and Terraforming allow the deck to grab what it needs and wants, and in Avarice's case recycle the ED monsters in case the game becomes grindy and also to alleviate the loss of ED monsters with Prosperity's effect. Harpie's, Evenly, Thrust and Talents aid the deck in being able to break boards. My tech card of choice is none other than Herald Of The Abyss. This card is actually really good in a format. Being able to out things like Shangri-Ira/Arise Heart, while circumventing the effects of Forbidden Lance and inbuilt destruction protection is a real premium. It also is very good at being able to out untargetable/unkillable/unaffected by card effects boss monsters that are typically the bane of Striker's existence as Herald affects the player, not the card. This is vital for the Labrynth matchup in particular to deal with Lady Labrynth, as that cannot be targeted or destroyed whilst there are set traps on the field.&nbsp; Other monsters such as Avramax,/Arrival Cyberse/Mirrorjade/Dragoon also fall to Herald as well, making it incredibly versatile in rogue matchups or for Jade/Dragoon in Branded.</p><p>The side deck consists of Lava Golem, as the deck has enough methods now to get to your ED monsters with Linkage, Area Zero, Drones so as to not need to heavily rely on your normal summon as much. I'm currently testing out both Lancea and Droll, so they could interchange. Cosmic Cyclone because Anti-Spell Fragrance has seen an uptake in the side deck due to the Kashtira spells often being critical for them to make the plays they require, and I don't feel like using Twisters due to the discard cost. Solemn to say no to anything that hits my backrow, D-Barrier for the meta decks and the final copy of Evenly to round it off nicely.</p>"

With Cyberstein added, I can also add a layer of negation with Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon, or commit some foolery with Depsia Proskenion or Invoked Purgatrio (if I main deck Book of Eclipse). I also added the classic Normal Trap staples such as Dogmatika Punishment and Evenly Match in the deck as inspiration for the recent YCS's that did such concepts.</p>"

It was one of my first two decks I went for on MD with Eldlich, because I also love zombies.&nbsp; They were strong enough in season 1 to get me to gold but that is where Eldlich had to take over.&nbsp; With Rikka support, this deck can evolve into a field clearing XYZ powerhouse.</p><p>I run 2 Rikka Petal and 3 Lonefire Blossom for consistency.&nbsp; Once both Petals are in the GY, you can only use one per turn, so if you want to remove one, you can, but between these 5 cards, it makes for a very easy time getting your first petal on the field/GY to go into Snowdrop The Rikka Fairy.&nbsp; A lot of this deck revolves around Snowdrop.&nbsp; Snowdrop will allow you to mimic a cards level and change all cards on your field to that level.</p><p>Foolish Burial is amazing here.&nbsp; It is an extra way to get Petal into the GY if you don't draw Petal, Lonfire, or Snowdrop.&nbsp; If you don't need to get to Petal, it can be used to mill out Spore, Carrotweight, or Rose Lover.&nbsp; Carrotweight is best milled when you already have Spore or Rose in hand.&nbsp; This lets you get a free level 4 on the field and gives you a resource in the GY to summon from hand or set up for XYZ summon with Spore.&nbsp; Carrotweight can be brought down to a single copy in favor of Ash, Fengli, or Called by the Grave.</p><p>Sekka's Light x2 is something I am still playing with, but it is a strong card and not very punishing if you need to use it.&nbsp; Between the two copies, you can draw 4 cards and re draw 2.&nbsp; Try to save them for after you have used Foolish and Miracle Fertilizer if you can, but this is not necessary if you need the draw 2.&nbsp; These can also be swapped for Called by Grave, Miracle, or Ash.</p><p>Miracle is really strong with XYZ as well.&nbsp; It beats out Monster Reborn because it can special summon across multiple turns.&nbsp; It consumes your normal summon, but this isn't an issue.&nbsp; It's true power comes from summoning XYZ material.&nbsp; It reads, ""If a monster Special Summoned by this effect leaves the field, destroy this card;"" however, if you use that special summoned monster as XYZ material, it never left the field and it is no longer special summoned by Miracle, so detaching to GY does not destroy it.</p><p>Rose Archer is a bit of more fluid in this deck, but I run it because it works really well with plants and it is a very budget card.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can run Ash, Effect Veiler, Maxx ""C"", Ogre, or Imperm.&nbsp; Archer is also a great hand trap to combat the Imperms.</p><p>Evil Thorn could be worked out for something else, but it makes an easy way to summon Princessprite.&nbsp; Turn one with Petal can search Snowdrop, tribute Petal, summon Snowdrop and Thorn, then activate Thorn and summon the other two from the deck.&nbsp; Use Snowdrop to set their levels to 8 and summon Teardrop the Rikka Queen off of the Thorns leaving Snowdrop in def.</p><p>Using the first part of Snowdrop locks you into plant special summons, but if it survives, next turn you can set another monster to 8 and XYZ Number 97 and XYZ 97 into Number 92 if needed.&nbsp; Otherwise Number 107 and Hieratic are strong non-plant options.&nbsp; Just remember that if there are no plants on the field, Rose Archer is useless.</p><p>Dark Armed, The Dragon of Annihilation is currently in the deck, but it doesn't see much play and could be swapped for something else.&nbsp; It is a little tricky to get out as it requires at least 1 Dark XYZ to be in GY and then Snowdrop another dark monster to level 5+, but it creates a strong 1 cost XYZ.&nbsp; Alternatively, Number 87 is a strong base attack with ok effects option but has a high cost of 3 level 8 monsters.&nbsp; There is also Sacred Tree Beast which has a strong effect, but cost 2 level 9 monsters.&nbsp; This requires to Spore off one of the 4 level 8's in the deck and isn't the easiest summon, but sets up a great negate and has easy material generation.</p><p>Other Side Deck options are there as some decent swaps to the more flexible cards in the deck.&nbsp;

Feel free to experiment and add more!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The main combo of this deck is straightforward as well as adaptable since the main boss, Tri-Heart is made with any 3 effect monsters on the field. Scareclaw standard combo ends with a towers monster with a floodgate effect (Tri-Heart), 1 omni-negate/pop of 2 cards (Scareclaw traps) and an additional draw (Reichheart's effect).&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">1 level 3 Scareclaw + extender in hand:&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li>Normal summon the level 3 Scareclaw monster. Link the Scareclaw monster into Light-Heart. Search the fieldspell from deck Reichphobia.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Reichphobia to search for Visas Starfrost.</li><li>Special summon Visas Starfrost from hand by destroying Light-Heart.&nbsp;</li><li>Special summon Light-Heart from the GY beside Visas Starfrost.&nbsp;</li><li>Special summon your extender (another Scareclaw, Adventure monster, Kastira Fenrir etc.). Link 3 monsters to summon Tri-Heart.&nbsp;</li><li>Complete any more summons with extenders (Like Dogmatika and Adventure), since the next step locks you into Scareclaw.&nbsp;</li><li>Special summon from the GY a level 3 Scareclaw with Tri-Heart's effect, then search for Scareclaw Reichheart.&nbsp;</li><li>Special summon Reichheart and search for your Scareclaw card of choice (usually Sclash for the omni-negate), then draw more card.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>It is suggested to bait for interruption by first using the Adventure cards. Gryphon Rider helps out vs. cards that would end your turn mid-combo like Nibiru. Another good bait is first using Kashtira Fenrir, since it searches for Kashtira Scareclaw, an excellent extender for the archetype. Fenrir's search isn't needed for the combo making it perfect bait for an Imperm, Ash, etc.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Scareclaw primarily functions as a turn 3 OTK deck just like Salamangreat and Tri-Brigade - Set up interruptions and board presence on the first turn, disrupt your opponent as much as possible on turn 2, then on turn 3 you OTK as you clear their board and attack for game with Tri-Heart and Accesscode.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you're going second, (depending on your hand and current gamestate) you can either immediately go for the kill or build your board after you clear your opponent's. This deck has a myriad of ways to clear boards such as Rite of Aramesir (bounce with Dracoback), Nadir Servant (pop with by sending N'Tss), Primal Planet Reichphobia (pop with 3 DEF position monsters). Monsters such as Tri-Heart, Accesscode, Fenrir and Lava Golem (searchable with Small World!) also clear boards of problematic cards.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><br /><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal"">The best baits for interruption before you start your main Scareclaw combo are the Adventure cards and Kashtira Fenrir. It forces your opponent to use their Ash or negate on board, allowing you to fully combo off!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck easily second and either OTK or establish a board. When going second, think whether you can go for lethal or equalize the board state enough where you're ahead in resources so you can finish off your opponent for the next turn.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">When siding out cards, the best cards to exhange are 1 copy of each Scareclaw, Dogmatika Punishment and Scareclaw Twinsaw. </li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck can also use Super Polymerization reliably to clear boards, especially with Garura. (I just didn't use it for this deck build since the meta right now are Kashtira and Labyrinth, which are fairly immune to Super Poly).</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Another card this deck can use for extra consistency is Pot of Prosperity, since the only Extra Deck monsters you truly need are Light-Heart and Tri-Heart.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">If you're going first, and you think your opponent is going to board wipe you, don't commit all your resources in your hand to the board. Just have enough board presence were you can survive until next turn and swing back the game in your favour.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Board breakers like Lava Golem and Kurikara are very searchable with Small World. Both are very situational, and they can reliably out an established board so you can do your plays.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drip fed incredible support cards, Scareclaw has ridiculous consistency with their Link-1 Light-Heart. Extreme consistency means more staple cards and supplimentary engines like Dogmatika can be stuffed into this already strong deck. Synergy with the Adventure Engine means that Scareclaw can reliably play through the all-too-common and devastating Nibiru, a card that destroys almost every strategy in today's meta!</p><p>With all the support Scareclaw has received the past couple main sets and how the recent banlists worked out, they now have reached critical mass to competitively viability. The question is, does Scareclaw earn itself a worthwhile spot among its stronger Visas Starfrost lore siblings - Tearlaments, Kashtira and Manadome? Only time will tell. Time to pilot the deck to find out!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Dinosaur King is your destiny, yeah!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Childhood nostalgia aside, I'm glad Konami tried to revitalize Dinosaurs with the Transcendrake archetype. Not only does Ground Xeno let you search a normal Dino or a Dino tuner, but it also pops a card in your hand and lets you do a Fusion Summon. Plus, the archetype incentivizes you to play Level 4 and 6 Dinosaur Normal monsters that you might like. Gigantozowler, Drillgnathus, and Glaciasaurus are all references to 3 of those monsters that I mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So not only does Transcendrake give Dinos a leg up, but it also gives you a reason to take Megalosmasher X or Kabazauls out of your binder. This deck has 8 hand traps, a Called By The Grave, and Pot of Prosperity, so it can do fine going first or second. As for this deck's name, ""Kyoryu"" is the Japanese word for ""Dinosaur"", and ""<span>ō"" being the Japanese word for ""King.""&nbsp;</span></p>"

No more spoilers, but Denji's friend Pochita is not only the Chainsaw Devil, but is also called the ""Hero of Hell."" I understand that it would have been more thematically appropriate to use Elemental HERO Wildedge, but it's honestly mid. Sure, it can attack all monsters the opponent controls once each, but if its ATK was 3000, this effect would be better. In addition to that, Wildedge doesn't deal piercing damage, nor does it have effects that increase or descrease ATK/DEF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, this deck can go second due to having 6 hand traps and 3 Forbidden Droplets. As for Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage, it's good going first or second, since if can search Favorite Contact, and tribute itself to summon Elemental HERO Sunrise if Neos was used as Fusion Material. If you go first, you can use this combo to search Favorite Contact and disrupt the opponent's board with Shining Neos Wiseman.

The Elemental HEROs and Neo-Spacians team up to bring justice.,"<p>This one's been another strategy that's been on the back burner of pet decks to boost to a somewhat competitive level while still maintaining its identity and not just falling prey to jamming in as many engines and broken backrow as possible to make it competitively viable. While this list isn't as refined as my World Chalice or Monarch builds of the past, it's been a blast to use and represents a ton of interesting gamestates with and without the use of Spirit of Neos who will potentially be retiring after this brief collaboration. Regardless, the core remains so I may as well document this while I have the opportunity, yeah?<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>OTK Potential</strong>: Fusion decks inherently have the advantage of being able to cheat the summon limit and jump straight into powerful boss monsters. Due to HEROs being pretty consistent with the over a decade worth of a support they have combined with all of the juicy warrior support cards means that the potential to just OTK from unexpected thresholds is real. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as high of a consistent threshold like Fluffal can be, but the potential can be theoretically higher depending on the hand.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reversal Potential</strong>: Shining Neos Wingman, Absolute Zero, Acid, Favorite Contact, and Miracle Fusion produce ridiculous levels of threat leaning closely to the presence that Vision HERO Trinity used to, without the need to cram three monsters into one.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Sky is the Limit</strong>: The starters can be pretty easy, but with the Neos and Neo-Spacian cards included, a lot of the lines can get pretty complicated. That aside, mastery of the list rewards creative synergies and ways of getting around pesky material restrictions for the extra deck lineup.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Minimal Disruption</strong>: This isn't HERO Beat, so we won't be naturally expecting to jam a guy, set five, and pass (though you can still play Hero Blast recycling Neos for a pretty hilarious payoff). We mostly aim to play through established boards and end the game fast. The less the better, but for some lines, like <strong>Brave Neos</strong>, it's better that your opponent at least control something. Most of the interaction we'll have are just ways to tag out our monsters, protect them, and remove backrow.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Neo Space</strong>: Despite Grand Mole and Aqua Dolphin having decent enough effects that can and should come up, they are objectively some of the worst cards in the deck and the deck does suffer for it. They are played as Aqua Dolphin is Unbound thanks to Marine always being treated as Dolphin and it being a WATER Warrior enables it to be a target for RotA and material for Absolute Zero. Grand Mole's just a pesky boy. Dark Panther's played for Nebula since its effect is incredible when it resolves but it is definitely able to be cut. We just need to have some space for Spacians for <strong>EN -&nbsp; Engage Neo Space</strong>. They also let us use Convert Contact... I guess?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Limited Xtra Options</strong>: The Extra Deck isn't too tight with cards like Nova Master and Grandmerge being expendable as an example; however, not too many adjustments can be made to make more room for Links (to use Neo-Spacians for) or more versatile Xyzs. This is mostly just a result of trying to maintain the core identity of the archetype rather than have most games just be decided by something like Claivesolish OTK.</li></ul><hr /><p><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />The hands can be pretty complicated to unravel, so I'll only really be breaking down some of the most relevant starters. It's worth noting that the fate of Spirit of Neos in a future banlist might change a lot of these lines, so heed caution.</p><ul><li><strong>The Classic: </strong>Having a way to turn HEROs into Sunrise and pick up Miracle is great and Sunrise while expressing a decent pop effect isn't all that important when it comes to modern Trinity standards. It is mostly just our way of resolving effects like Shadow Mist and Liquid without banishing them prior or having to waste Absolute Zero like one would in the past.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Engage... not that one:</strong> Engage Neo Space is a pretty interesting card that offers you the ability to send Shadow Mist directly to GY as cost or bin an early Aqua Dolphin for Miracle Fusion setups and immediately beam out either Spirit of Neos or the OG Vanilla. The target only really matters for maintaining minimum summons for a play; however, if you go into Spirit of Neos, you can resolve the effect for Favorite or Instant Contact then tag out into OG Vanilla Neos to use as a material for something like Brave Neos on an attacking turn. Couple that with Stratos or Mist being able to search back the shuffled Spirit as a ""defensive"" search during the opponent's turn makes Engage a fairly potent card. Just gotta have the respective card in hand to activate it.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Spirit:</strong> Outside of the aforementioned lines, if you can just access this card through something like Stratos, Mist, or E Call can have a way of summoning it prior to resolving stuff like Engage, you can seriously snowball your advantage and broaden the scope of your searches. On the opponent's turn, you'll be wanting to pick up Instant Contact most of the time; however, Favorite Contact's a safer line, albeit slower. Using Instant Contact, we can cheat out all of our potent, searcher Fusions or if we already have access to a fusion method like Polymerization, then we can summon Flame Wingman (or reveal it for Over Fusion) to fusion summon <strong>Shining Neos Wingman</strong>. Yes, all of this is from Spirit of Neos... as an opener. Fast right?</li></ul><p>You'll want to assess your removal and interaction by estimating how many turns it should take you to conclude the duel. Since we aren't on a lot of recursion or that amazing <strong>Legacy of a Hero</strong> card, we can't go too late game. Most plays are one-and-done, so make them count!</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />If you're struggling to break even, you can use the following lines to tip the game into your favor.</p><ul><li><strong>Fallen Mist: </strong>If Shadow Mist was sent to the GY in a prior turn, pick up Liquid Soldier, and use him to resurrect Mist and grab Mask Change. This gives you the ability to threaten Acid for Fast Effect Harpie's Feather Duster that also lowers ATK or pivot into Xtra HERO Wonder Driver and use Mist to grab Spirit of Neos. If the opponent attacks, you can summon Spirit at Link Point under Wonder Driver and recycle a fusion method. If they simply just pop Wonder Driver instead, you can still use the float effect to summon Neos anyway just in case they plan to play it safe and have you summon Spirit. The option of a Rank 4's also always on the table when it comes to Liquid Mist, but a comfortable line is simply using Liquid to resummon Stratos. Judge the gamestate and decide if you can use the Spell/Trap destruction effect, a search isn't always needed to close out games in Trinity.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Pretty Good</strong><strong>:</strong> Liquid and Cross Keeper cycling comes up a lot. Not just for ways to close out the game easier, but also for the limited Traps we're on in this build. Almost all of them stand to end the game way faster than your opponent might expect and you showing off flashy combos from yours truly will have them respecting your backrow less and less, especially if you set Polymerization as a bluff.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Brave Neos: </strong>Use this the same way you would <strong>Spirit of Neos</strong>, but proactively through its destruction by battle, as opposed to reactively when being attacked. This card usually forces interaction on it, so be ready to trade resources. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Omni HERO: </strong>Absolute Zero, The Shining, and Nova Master are our HEROs for the job in this build. Nova Master's great in simplified gamestates, Absolute Zero's the most notable in most gamestates, and The Shining's great for looping things either banished by the opponent or by you for a Miracle Fusion (including its materials).<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Core Convergence:</strong> While <strong>Elemental HERO Core</strong> might seem like a weird choice and one you won't be summoning a lot, it makes a great late game Miracle Fusion target as it can be used to resummon <em>any </em>HERO Fusion previously used in the duel. This is great for Brave Neos but particularly for Sunrise as Sunrise triggers on any Special Summon, not just proper Fusion Summon.</li></ul><p>The games shouldn't go too long; however, in the event that does happen these are some decent options for closing things out immediately.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shining Neos Wingman: </strong>A protected card that pops things on summon and gains scaling attack based on the cards in your GY <em>and</em> burns the opponent after a battle concludes? This thing goes absolutely wild and is an incredible ender accessed through Over Fusion and Instant Contact. Polymerization's the risky way to getting to it and I recommend holding at least one Miracle Fusion for making this as a finale since you'll be able to do it as the first summon and still have room for more after the way's been cleared.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Grandmerge: </strong>Using two Neos', you can use the battle tag to go into quite literally any Fusion in the Extra Deck. If you don't see an easy line to game, I recommend tagging out into <strong>Nebula Neos</strong> and drawing a ridiculous amount of cards. You can then choose to negate itself (and still get the draw) so it doesn't return to the Extra at End Phase, or negate something else. For this same reason, <strong>Contrast HERO Chaos </strong>can be a great option since it's always treated as an Elemental HERO.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>HENSHIN!: </strong>The Mask Change options in this list aren't as snowbally as something like Anki; however, they are still rather potent. Turning your LIGHT beatsticks into Koga and using Koga to steal games is a great option that can go under most people's radar as you don't really represent any Mask Changes in this deck.</li></ul><hr /><p><br />It's not expected that the Spirit of Neos lines will last forever, but after testing without the card and just opting for a second copy of Brave Neos or Engage, it'll ultimately be fine, just not the explosive threat that it currently is. Regardless, due to the number of lines offered through Engage, Stratos, Mist, and Spirit of Neos alike, the following are great considerations for shaking up the deck:<br /><br /><em>Predaplants &amp; Chaos Monsters, Super Polymerization, Dark Magician &amp; Dark Cavalry, Rank 7s like Big Eye to summon through Spirit of Neos and Instant Contact, Infernoble Knights &amp; Burstinatrix, Fallen of Albaz, Skyscraper II - Hero City (trust me). <br /><br /></em>Thanks for reading this far if you have. The viability of this deck likely won't last in the same condition it currently exists in, but with Honest Neos, Neos Fusion, DPE, and Vyon being out of the picture, I imagine there is likely more to be expected when it comes to hitting this archetype once Maze of Memes rolls in and we get Wake Up.

Of course, it's weak compared to the OCG 60 card version because we don't have Block Dragon or Grass for instance but we can still do some cool things like setting up a Savage Borreload Dragon and a Gallant Granite without a normal summon. Also, I once again included an Hop Ear Squadron (that we can search thanks to Cupid Pitch) to have more options + win in time. It is NOT a definitive deck list and it will definitely change when the next banlist is revealed around CYAC's release so please don't take for granted everything you see in here because we will have to adapt.</p>"

Until then, I hope you're prepared to search an incredible amount, take advantage of the summon limit, and control the battlefield with pressure that makes control decks jealous of the hand advantage you can amass (although they've probably got us beat here when it comes to Traps and such-...) anyway here's the rundown of the new Dark Magician line-up!<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Snowball</strong>: You rack up advantage pretty quickly once you get going with this strategy. Between all of the layers of protection and nuance regarding the disruption lines on top of all of the means of searching from over a decade's worth of support? It's honestly difficult not to win after taking the lead.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Comeback Potential</strong>: Just having Illusion, Rod, Controlling the Dark Magician, or even just having Soul Servant in the GY during mid-to-late game will keep you in the game regardless of how things are going. Just don't play too zealously into something like a Trickstar Candina!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Rewarding Ceiling</strong>: While a lot of the early lines are pretty straightforward, most of the complexities with the archetype as a whole come from the usage of cards in tandem with one another. As opposed to early TCG builds where you kind of just drew cards and hoped it was enough to combo or amass a handtrap/backrow advantage, in Trinity, you'll be much more rewarded for your mastery of the cards at your disposal and how to best navigate the board you're dealt with or expecting. At times the pressure can be nigh suffocating from this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Possible to Brick</strong>: Unlike its TCG counterpart, due to the nature of the format, DM can't exactly take advantage of so much deck-thinning and draw power and while some cards like the Spellbook engine would help with the cycling process a bit, they will always be setting you a turn behind and adding more additional cards to cycle through in the long run. A brick doesn't necessarily equate to your searchers and passing, it's more of the unplayable circumstances of drawing... all of the Dark Magicians and having no way of summoning them. Hence why we've got some backrow to fall back on and ways to cheat him out in the event of a crisis.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong>: This particular list makes great use of Dark Magician Girl and cards concerning her (without playing the Magician Girl archetype of course) and as amazing as the cards surrounding her are, she herself is terrible to use. You'll be wanting to bin her whenever possible or simply control her when under gamestates like Magician's Combination. There's even a cheeky setup concerning Brain Controll (or Big Eye) and using her as Xyz material to go into Dhampir Sheridan. All of those applications aside, she (and her Signature Spell) aren't that great and don't feel that great to have until necessary for certain combos.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stat-Checked</strong>: If faced with too many monsters that are 3000 ATK/DEF or above you might run into a brick wall sometimes. You can tech in the Honests to get around this a bit better, but you'll need to hard draw those. Mahad can clear all things that are DARK and Apprentice can help the respective targets clear certain thresholds but most of the time those will be one use situations. Fortunately you can use Soul Servant to stack them from the GY to the top of deck for one final use.</li></ul><p>With introductions over, let's get into the setups you'll want to seek seek more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />Thanks to all of the years of support this archetype has received it has gained a number of searchers and retroactive searchers to help boost its consistency and lines of play to be very reliable which is a massive boon when it comes to limited formats like this one. Generally, any starter will net you the same gamestate no matter what goes down; however, there are some combinations of 2 or more cards that do require a bit more setup.</p><ul><li><strong>Manju &amp; Senju: </strong>Opening one of these cards enables you to grab Illusion of Chaos (or Sauravis if you already have it) then search Magicians' Souls. Using Souls you'll want to setup your GY with either Mana to protect your plays going down the line or DM/DMG to establish them early and get them in rotation for the later stages of the game. Then you'll pivot into either Dharc or Lyna. With Dharc you can grab <strong>Magikuriboh </strong>and use it during that same battle phase (or main phase later) to summon a Dark M agician immediately, <strong>Witch of the Black Forest</strong> if you have particularly greedy setup lines to go for in future turns with fusion plays or revival, or simply <strong>Magician's Rod</strong> who is the best starter in the deck when combined with other cards in the strategy and it's not even close! As for Lyna, <strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</strong> will be our primary find; however, <strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> isn't particularly bad either. The reason why is below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Diviner of the Herald:</strong> Using its effect to send, we'll pitch Arc Light from our Extra Deck to make it a Level 6 tuner, then we'll use Arc Light to grab Illusion of Chaos from the deck. Using Illusion, we'll pick up Magicians' Souls and send the appropriate targets like within the Manju &amp; Senju lines to the GY to summon it directly from the hand. Then we'll Synchro Summon itno <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. This card being a Level 7 who revives itself and answers the board during the SP is very handy for Rank 7 lines and getting rid of pesky monsters. It's worth noting that her banish effect to bring herself back does come up in this deck so don't use it willy-nilly. Banishing Souls is fine, but everything else in this list definitely is not. Use it within moderation as her effect can be used even on turns where she wasn't sent to the GY since it checks during each of their End Phase's. If you happen to need Rod and have a usable S/T at your disposal, you can summon her back, then use that S/T to tribute her and add back the Magician's Rod at EP to start your turn with your primary searcher. Very handy indeed.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Rod:</strong> This card probably has the highest ceiling regarding its uses since now, with Illusion of Chaos, it can search the entire archetype and its support including adding Dark Magician to the hand when necessary. You may also want to (if on the second turn or later) Link it off into Clara &amp; Rushka so that during the opponent's turn, when you activate an S/T, you can tribute the link to add Rod back to hand. One line I like to particularly setup involves using it as fusion material for <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> by grabbing <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>, that way in the event that the Fusion would be destroyed and I have a S/T I can use, I'd usually tribute away the Dark Magician girl to recycle Rod for next turn. You can also go for some pretty devastating Bond Between Teacher and Student setups when going second (or later in the game) to nuke your opponent's S/Ts or Monsters. It was this particular line of play that actually winded up getting <strong>Dark Burning</strong> <strong>Magic </strong>banned here. Oops.</li></ul><p>The majority of the time you'll want to stick to opening with one of these cards but if you happen to find yourself opening things like just DM or ways to him, it's still fine to cycle your respective S/Ts and support him as necessary. He's still the star of the deck and it's important to make sure you keep up your advantage until you can snowball the game out of controll.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where most games can end for you since the deck can swarm pretty decently after being setup or be rather controlling between Aruru and Mana being a devastating duo.</p><ul><li><strong>Bystial Baldrake: </strong>This card challenges most strategies with just its D.D. Crow effect; however, also being able to bin Dark Magicians, Rods, or resolved Manju/Senjus comes in handy for its tribute cost while still representing a lot of pressure. Additionally, it's a Dragon for a potential Fusion play into Dragon Knights and <em>finally</em>, it is a Level 6 that can be used to make Sheridan or Wollow to completely turn the game on its head proactively rather than reactively. If you can only banish out of your GY, then Servant, Mahad, and the Ritual Package should be fine banishes without any notable lasting consequences. You lose 1 draw for banishing out Palladiums but that's a sacrifice you have to make sometimes.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Eternal Soul: </strong>Don't flip this card too early without insurance, it immediately puts a target on itself and players usually try to remove it when its face-up every time. That said, it can revive DMs for free and search out your one-sided Heavy Storm whenever you want. Use it to secure a lead or establish one. The safest setup to use it under midgame is definitely when controlling <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> fusion monster, since if Eternal Soul leaves, the fusion would be destroyed but still float into the master and student, ultimately not setting you too far behind.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Soul Servant: </strong>This card's GY effect is rather potent and is virtually unrivaled when it comes to Unlimited power cards in Trinity Format. You'll usually be resolving it to draw two; however, with this build it's possible to draw up to four cards naturally from this effect- and we play TWO copies. The most important things to note about the stacking (and not searching) effect is that you can use it during the EP of your opponent's turn to rig your next draw and <em>the fact that this card can stack cards from your GY to the top of the deck</em> which is very, very potent in a limited format. Don't forget this as it might save you when piloting the deck!</li></ul><p>Should the game not end at this point and you find yourself in a complex, mind-boggling gamestate then you're probably going to want one of the following closers.</p><p><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight &amp; Eternal Soul: </strong>This combination is really rough to deal with, especially since S/T removal is very limited in Trinity, so if this is established you have virtually won. DMtDK is treated as DM so it can be revived by Eternal Soul and is constantly under its protection, additionally, Eternal Soul is protected by DMtDK's continuous effect, making this a really rough situation to navigate for the opponent in most cases. Additionally, since DMtDK is treated as DM, it works with the field spell <strong>Magician's Salvation</strong> and <strong>Magician's Combination</strong> so even something like a DMG can represent DMtDK coming back over and over while protecting said cards in the process. This card is a monster and needs to be respected when properly established.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Combination: </strong>Probably the most underrated support card this deck has at its disposal. You tag out your DM/DMG to their counterpart and negate any card or effect (just not the activation so no Damage Step shenanigans). Once the opponent has had enough and decides to blow up Combination, it even has a revenge effect to clear a card on their side of the field. You can also force this effect yourself with <strong>Timaeus the United</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Magicians' Souls </strong>turning those plays into removal.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Signature Move: </strong>Though these cards are often considered bad and I even think so most of the time myself, I cannot understate how potent their effects are when they resolve. In all of my history playtesting this deck in any iteration, the games in which the Signature Attacks of the duo have resolved have always resulted in my win. Whether that be the easily accessed <strong>Dark Magic Attack </strong>or the trickier to pull off <strong>Dark Burning Attack</strong> (though you can access it easier with Bond), the signature moves can really just blow away opponents regardless of their deck type and cut the game shorter than what they might have been expecting.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />Since the lines from the archetype itself are rather consistent, the deck can be easy to get started with, but might take a bit to get used to and master; however, it's usability allows a great deal of customizability to cater to most tech choices like Dragonmaids or the legal Bystials to establish DMtDK easier or SPYRAL to do Master Plan setups with Magicians' Souls. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>The Eye of Timaeus, Chaos Creator, Kashtira Monsters &amp; Birth, Magician of Dark Illusion, the remaining Bystials, Protecting Spirit Loagaeth, Noctovision Dragon, Mana Dragon Zimitron, Magician of Chaos, &amp; Chaos Form, Chicken Game, Destined Rivals, and Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous<br /></em><br />As always, if you've made it this far, thanks for checking this write-up out and combing over my iteration of the Dark Magician Starter. Once Chronicle Sorceress arrives you can rest assured that I'll be updating things with fresh lines and even more explosive combos since she increases the deck's consistency by a considerable margin. Until then, we'll just have to keep up a steady pace and recite the incantations of the ulimate wizard in terms of attack and defense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
