Not only is the base deck 0 points, with the only mandatory card that costs anything being Dragite, but taking advantage that not many handtraps fill the format by going all out and being able to play some of the best handtraps themselves.</p><p>This version of the deck is better going second, but the side deck has some blowout that can win the game if you want to go first in games 2 and 3.

It's ability to use Hand Traps both as disruption and as extenders makes them always playable even if their activation conditons are unavailable. The inherent locks in the deck do limit what engines you can use but can be easly cirumvented and the ability to play low to the ground makes it so that your never in a situation where you're not playing.

Before Phryxul's release from DOOD, the Branded Dracotail player would be forced instead to go to Lubellion by sending Mululu and Albaz, which may search a Dracotail spell/trap, but neglects searching for a Branded spell/trap because of the lack of Albion. Forget Phryxul's effects for a second, her most important characteristic is her attribute - LIGHT! This allows Branded Fusion to fusion summon Albion using Phyxul and Albaz, allowing you to simultanously search a Dracotail spell/trap and a Branded spell/trap during the End Phase (aka Main Phase 3 for Branded players)!<br /><br />As a result, Branded Dracotail is now a much more synergistic fusion of both archetypes! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

If you open no Sarcophagus or Gadget Trio, but have Dark Magician Girl or Future Silence, resolve these so you can special summon Dark Magician Girl. Then you can play Shining Sarcophagus. From there, you summon Dark Magician of Destruction to search your Dark Magician. This gives a consistent line for using your Dragon's Mind.<br />The Pot of Greed and Upstart Goblin allow the deck to run at 35 cards with 12 starters. Shining's greatest weakness is not getting enough starters in your opening hand. (You need about 1 per negate your opponent has on resolution.)</p><p><br />Other Tips: Keep Super poly in your hand if you go first, and have a good opening, then use it during your own next draw phase to out there board if they comboed off.</p><p><br />Cards to replace: (These are the weakest cards in the deck and ones I'm considering removing for something else)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quaking Mirror Force (Powerful when combined with Gandora, but very slow)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Widow Anchor (Only works if you have no field)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Angel Statue (Predictable and adds very little value if you go 2nd or don't draw it in your opening hand)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2nd Gandora (The deck only needs one, but 2nd does come up sometimes for fusions and discard fodder)</p>"

It requires 2 monsters with different types and attributes, and says once per turn (hopt) you can reveal 1 Ritual Monster in your hand; add, from your deck to your hand, 1 Ritual Monster with a different Type and Attribute.<br /><br />So this means that you can do the following: normal summon Gishki Grimness, special summon Gishki Abyss from deck, add Gishki Vision from deck to hand, discard vision to add Evigishki Neremanas from deck to hand, then link summon Salamangreat Almiraj using gishki grimness (600 ATK), then link summon ASHLAN U1000 using Almiraj and Gishki Abyss. From here, simply reveal Neremanas to add Ame no Habakuri no Mitsurugi from deck to hand.<br /><br />The doorways ASHLAN U1000 opens up from a deckbuilding perspective for Ritual decks is really mindblowing. Here we have a link 2 that can be summoned in almost any ritual deck, and thrives off the combination of different archetypes due to their inherently different typing and attributes. </p><p>The impcantations offer surprising flexibility. Take Impcantation Chalislime, a card that mimics Habakuri's special ability that lets you reveal itself to summon a monster that tutors another card. It can now be used as a one-card combo enable due to the fact that it can summon talismandra, letting you directly add Habakuri from deck to hand. Evigishki Gustkraken is your main target when using the Impcantation Inception, the archetypes built in ritual spell. The impcantations ability to set up 2 successive ritual summons with any level 6 or lower ritual monster works perfectly with Gustkraken, easily allowing you to rip 2 cards from the opponents hand before/after almost any section of this combo. From there, you can overlay into an M7 to retrieve any monster from the graveyard, including any monster discarded by chalislime to activate its effect in the first place.<br /><br />To be able to use a a ritual package like the impcantations but then also have the ability to bypass their use if necessary is absurd, and with 20 one card starters, only 7 of them <em>actually</em> requiring your normal summon, the deck features excellent flexibilty and starting power. The mitsurugi engine turns each chalislime, preparation of rites, focused aquamirror or gishki grimness into Mitsurugi Habakuri access, a strong upside to the investment.<br /><br />None of this would matter if we didn't have an ace in the hole, a way to bottleneck all incoming decks from defeating your board. Mitsurugi already produced flexible, deep end boards that could navigate around opponents interruption. Now, with the addition of ASHLAN U1000 into almost every combo situation, we now have a way to consistently summon Spright Sprind. This lets us send Mirror Mage of the Ice Barrier from deck to graveyard, conveniently setting up a Rank 2 summon of Gigantic Spright using Spright Sprind and Mirror Mage. This of course gives you access to your Gishki Grimness from the deck, but it also gives you access to another important Level 2 Monster: Knightmare Corruptor Iblee.<br /><br />By linking Gigantic Spright and Iblee into an I:P Masquerana, and making sure all of your monsters are in defense position, you are now able to lock down the opponents board. The opponent will 99.99% of the time will try to normal summon a monster in order to link it and Iblee away to unlock their board. When they do this, you just link IP and a ritual monster (most often will be Mitama as per normal Mitsurugi end boards) into Dyna Mondo to shuffle whatever monster they have. If they move to battle phase to attack Dyna Mondo and finally break the lock, simply activate Dyna Mondo to re-summon Mitama (or any other ritual) from the GY in defense position, ruining their chances of getting rid of Iblee and moving their turn to Main Phase 2, guarunteeing that you get to go to the next turn!<br /><br />This build of deck is the next generation of Mitsurugi Ritual Hybrids. Feel free to improve this concept. Enjoy!</p>"

No problem!,"<p>Virtual World has always been verstaile going first or second. Since the Full Armored cards are currently zero points, it is a powerful disruption tool and boardbreaker tools which generates draw power and discard fodder for the Virtual World Gates. Also, Snake-Eyes Vengenance Dragon is a powerful Level 12 Synchro that suits that deck well. You can negate an effect with Qinglong then use it for Vengenance to pop during the Battle Phase.</p><ul><li>Going First - Make Shenshen, Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer and/or Snake-Eyes Vengenance Dragon with Chuche set up.</li><li>Going Second - Utopia Beyond + Stardust Charge Warrior is an OTK on unprepared boards. People don't know the second secret effect.</li><li>Boardbreaking: The Extra Deck is filled with options depending on the situation in addition to the in-engine Virtual World Gates.</li><li>Side - More going second tools and Gravity Collapse as an omni-negate going first. Use with Shenshen since it can revive itself.</li></ul><p>The deck has a history of bricking and this version is no different. Preventing the first VW effect is crucial to stopping this deck. Not having Chuche access affects the grindgame considerably. The cost for Lulu is irritating and restricts you to 91 points, which does limit some good low cost point cards. The lack of the Extra Monster Zone hurts since we can't play Geomathmech Final Sigma in this format, which is brutal with Utopia Beyond.</p><p>Overall, Virtual World is still Virtual World.</p>"

The main problem with that is Primite and MWTM both heavily rely on the normal summon. Eldlich was a great addition to give more flexible routes while also not requiring the normal summon at all. With three main engines able to make plays, it's much easier now to bait out negates/inturuptions. I didn't expect it to turn out this way when first playing MWTM, but this deck is a great rank 4ish toolbox deck. It's pretty flexible there, allowing lvl 8 synchros and rank 6 XYZs as well.</p><p>Something to note with this deck is to be aware of the restrictions on some cards. Seventh Tachyon is an amazing searcher (uses giant hand to search both MWTM and Primite Dragon), but locks you into XYZs until the end of the turn. Lordly Lord allows us to choose between lvl 8 synchros and rank 4s but special summoned monsters cannot activate their effects until the next turn. So that really limits which synchros you can play. Some other decent options for synchros in this deck would be Cyber Slash Harpie Lady, Crimson Blader, and Chengying (lvl 10). Some other ideas for Seventh Tachyon are searching Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness to get a free summon with MWTM on the field. And using Number 101: Silent Honor Ark to search Surfacing Big Jaws. Free special summon if you have used a spell card that turn, but it does lock into XYZs only for the rest of the turn. Also extra deck space is so tight, I couldn't justify dropping Castel for Silent Honor Ark.</p><p>All 3 engines have amazing recursion. With all three pretty much having infinite resources if they aren't dealt with by your opponent. When one falls short in a match, the other 1-2 can take charge. All Apophis traps are normal monsters, allowing Primite Drillbeam to be live quite a bit. Even with you using Angel Trumpeter potentially every turn for an extra deck monster. Eldlich doesn't really interact with the other engines, it just does it's own thing. But it's an amazing compliment to both of them.</p><p>Darker Ruler and Gameciel in the main for going second, with more in the side deck if needed. And hopefully draw into your outs with the Mulcharmy handtraps. This is by no means the final version of this deck, still messing around with the handtraps. This deck is really locked into some high cost cards with Primite Lordly Lode and Infinite Impermanence. You need cards that you can set for your main Treasures of the Kings Combo, so handtrap traps are best. Unfortunately, the restrictions on the Dominus traps are too much for this deck. Purge locks you out of the Dark and Fire Monsters in this deck. And Evolzar Lars is a staple in this deck, I make it pretty much every turn 1 I can.</p><p>Another amazing going second card is Defense of the Temple. Pretty much a mini Super Poly that allows us to go into Divine Scorpion Beast of Serket, an absolutely amazing board breaker. Banishing monsters on summon/when battling, gaining attack, and attacking twice every turn.</p><p>There are 6 ""garnets"" in this deck, but the way this deck works, it doesn't matter too much when you draw them. The only objectively bad one is Golden Lord with no field spell. Seventh Tachyon is very useful for returning garnets, then drawing them the very same turn.</p><p>Still planning on making changes to the main and side deck, but sort of at a loss at the moment. Let me know if you all think of something. Hope you enjoy playing this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Including Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo Daedalus was purely a nostalgic decision and should not be genuinely considered for running a more optimal version of Umi Control. This deck less about consistency and more about ""sending a message"".</p><p>The deck is very Normal Summon reliant and your strategy will live and die by your ability to get Umi on the field alongside Kairyu-Shin. Electric Jellyfish and Sea Stealth Attack are powerful additions to that board.</p><p>Included Abyss Shark + Surfacing Big Jaws package in order to facilitate Stealth Kragen as a back-up plan (not running Gozen Match as that's 100pts). Having both Stealth Kragen and Kairyu-Shin on the field at the same time will be counter-intuitive to your strategy and should be avoided.</p><p>Seventh Tachyon is one of your best searchers for your monster pieces.</p><p>Extra Deck is possibly the weakest on this list as I had no clue what to add or use (this deck barely uses the ED but still, it's something that can likely be improved).</p>"

My fav deck all time is orcust. I love how they look, play and their story. Plus its nice they were a top deck at one point. So ive always kept the orcust core in every deck ive played and always will. Ive mixed orcust with live twin, tearlament, and a heavier world legacy package. This is my latest one. Orcust mixed with snake eyes and dpe. I love dpe and how good he is and difficulty removing aside from called. I love the snake eyes cards even though theyre no longer a top deck and are nerfed because of how cool they are. PLus do i need to say anything about diabellstar? her effect but also her design.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not sure if I can because I was looking through and having trouble finding one card that doesnt do anything and doesnt work well or isnt just a good card by itself, but I'm wondering if there's any improvements i can make. There's cards like a second called, lightning storm, droplet, orcustrated einsatz for the orcust stuff, mulcharmy, the dominus spell, caliga claw crow which is a free special summon and good for links. PLus malicious instead of dasher but I'd still need to take a second card out. Already at 41 and don't wanna go anymore above it. Problem is I have no idea what to take out for any 1 of those cards I just listed. So if you have any advice on what I could take out for those that would still preserve the orcust, snake eyes and dpe engine, i'd be glad to hear! so comment if you do!</p>"

While I was rebuilding the deck for the format, I also saw some good cards to add I forgot last time. Anywho, this deck makes people laugh, so t's always fun to play.</p><p>The Primary goal is to get relay soul set on the field, and use it on your opponent's turn to summon a monster that can remove itself from your field. The secondary goal is to make your opponent's turn as short as possible so you can lose as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Monsters that remove themself:</p><p>Lilith, lady of lament- Tributes itself to search relay soul. Obviously can also be used to search relay soul.</p><p>Arias the labrynth butler- If you open this, another monster that can remove itself, and relay soul/trap trick, you can do the STK turn 0. Otherwise, can send himself to the grave after being summoned to set another trap in your hand.</p><p>Dinowrestler pankratops- Tributes itself to destroy a card. Can also be used as a board breaker.</p><p>Ghost ogre and snow rabbit- Sends itself to the gy to destroy a card that activates it's effect. Can also be used as a hand trap.</p><p>Artifact Lancea- Tributes itself to prevent any cards from being banished this turn. Can also be used as a hand trap.</p><p>Rescue ace impulse- Tributes itself to summon rescue ace fire attacker, who can draw 2 cards then discard 1. Can also be used for consistency. Can also be used as a board breaker that negates the effects of the monster with the highest ATK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from monsters to consistency:</p><p>Pot of extravagance- Banish 6 cards from your extra deck, draw 2 cards. You play specifically these extra deck cards for decks like dogmatika that send your extra deck cards to the gy. Can also play fossil cards for this reason. Sanwitch is silly, so he deserves a spot.</p><p>Pot of duality- add 1 of the top 3 cards of your deck to your hand. You normally don't special summon on your turn, so the restriction doesn't really bother you. Also you only play 2 of each pot so you don't open 2-3 of the same pot in your hand often.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From consistency to pure hand traps:</p><p>Mulcharmy Fuwalos- Consistency piece. Can grab you so many hand traps that it just ends your opponent's turn.</p><p>Dimension shifter- Busted card that banishes any card sent tothe gy. Single handedly ends turns.</p><p>D.D. Crow- Banishes a card from the gy. It's free, and I had 2 empty slots in my deck.

You can resummon Liger after a Lava G, Use it to play through HTs, Get a Leo for free on board and disrupt opponents, sensational card.</p><p>Sauravis - I always side out fuwa and HP going first so I need 6 going first cards in my side to ensure I can push through whatever my opponent sides in. I have 3 Ash for fuwa, aswell as another FBG and a TBGL which left me with 1 more card. You could drop Sauravis for a LS/FD and run FD as card 6 but with my siding tendancies I found I rarely wanted any more of those cards and thus I opted for a Sauravis for of use as it can be used on both mine and the opponent's turn. (Also has a funny but niche interaction with SCMR where you can use it on your turn, resummon it on your field, then on the opponents turn you have a SS negate + banish and after that protection.</p><p>I chose not to run impulse as I'm opting for a board breaker approach and imo one ss negate and the cost of turning of Ptol and Cross-Sheep probably is not worth it over another breaker.

Poplar combos really well with Final Bringer of the End Times. You lead with the Snake-Eyes to chew through interaction and hopefully set a situation where you have two monsers in your S/T Zone to go into Doomed Dragon. As a supplementary engine, I use the Diabell cards to faciliate Vengenance Dragon following Diabell Vengenance's pop effect. The Sinful Spoils cards are selected to assist with pushing through plays and have some backrow if you go first. I opted against the Level 7 Diabellstar engine with Wanted as it was too expensive and did not quite do what I wanted. The side is filled with targeted hate for certain strageties and Breakthrough Skill combos with Foolish Burial Goods if needed. This deck struggles against backrow heavy decks and targeted banished effects on your Sinful Spoils engine. Can be bricky with multiple Oak, but am struggling to find appropriate replacements for it.&nbsp;</p>"

It is a tragic one. Like you can literally compare the absolute travesty that is Dream Mirror&rsquo;s archetypal gimmick to the tragedy of Oedipus. The archetype debuted as a TCG exclusive archetype in RIRA in 2019 and got its second wave of TCG support also in 2019 in CHIM. I don&rsquo;t know how you could play the Deck out of RIRA, and while it got more cards in CHIM, the Deck was still pretty much near unplayable due to its archetypal gimmick. After its BLVO support from the OCG in 2021, the Deck had better tools to work with, but because the other 75% of its cards were locked into their stupid gimmick, the Deck still was bad.

Was the Deck playable after Neiroy? It was more playable, but still bad.

They actually don&rsquo;t do much for the Deck other than allow your Dream Mirror monsters to access their effects. Other than for the 2 Neiroys, the DARK Dream Mirrors can Quick Effect Tribute themselves when Joy is in a Field Zone to Special Summon their LIGHT version from your Deck while the LIGHT Dream Mirrors can Quick Effect Tribute themselves when Terror is in a Field Zone to Special Summon their DARK version from your Deck. Save for the 2 Neiroys again, each Dream Mirror has an effect that triggers when they are Special Summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster. But you need the Field Spells to even allow them to tag into each other to even access their trigger effects on Special Summon. And you can probably see where the Deck begins to falter. Without the right Field Spell and the right monster, the Deck produces so many dead hands, and most hands where you can do something usually result in going extremely minus for no real benefit. So what is the Deck&rsquo;s goal? Before BLVO, the Deck aimed to end on </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Erlking</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> with some number of Main Deck Dream Mirrors on field because the Main Deck Dream Mirrors Tribute themselves to tag out, which triggers Light Oneiros&rsquo;s effect to target and destroy a card on the field.

The Attribute change is there because it is supposed to help out with getting the correct Attribute for your Dream Mirror Field Spell that is in play and for Fusion Summoning either Oneiros. 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Disciple</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Light Neiroy can activate in hand while there is a Dream Mirror monster on the field to Special Summon itself, and then you have the option of changing Light Neiroy to DARK Attribute. Then, if Light Neiroy is Special Summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster, including its own effect, it has a mandatory effect that activates which bounces a Spell/Trap your opponent controls to their hand and then you can draw a card and shuffle a card in hand back into the Deck if Dream Mirror of Joy is on field. Light Neiroy&rsquo;s second effect could come up, but you are mainly searching it off of Dark Neiroy and be able to immediately Summon it from hand to then Tribute for Dark Neiroy&rsquo;s other effect. Why are we playing 3 of this card? Well, that is because Light Neiroy can actually act as a Level 3 extender if you already opened a copy of it in your starting hand. Dark Neiroy searches for another Light Neiroy and you can do the rest of your combo with the searched Light Neiroy, but as soon as Light Ikelos tags out into Dark Ikelos, Dark Ikelos can Special Summon Light Neiroy from hand as your Level 3 extender. 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Light Ikelos adds a Dream Mirror card from Deck to hand except itself if Special Summoned by a Dream Mirror monster&rsquo;s effect while Dark Ikelos can Special Summon a Dream Mirror from hand also if Special Summoned by a Dream Mirror monster&rsquo;s effect. If Dream Mirror of Terror is in a Field Zone, Light Ikelos can Quick Effect to Tribute itself to Special Summon Dark Ikelos from Deck. And Dark Ikelos can also tag out for Light Ikelos from Deck in the same way if Dream Mirror of Joy is in a Field Zone. If anything, Light Ikelos is the better card as it is a searcher for the archetype (albeit a bad one), but Dark Ikelos is here for Light Ikelos to tag into to provide the Fusion Materials for Luce of either Oneiros.

While you control a DARK Dream Mirror, Terror inflicts 300 damage to your opponent each time they Special Summon a monster(s).

I don't think it is a very good Deck though. I have spent tinkering with an Eldlich Mayakashi list ever since&nbsp;<strong>Delta of Invitation</strong> got revealed for the OCG, trying to make a Deck that feels good to use, and I still have not gotten there. The issue with Mayakashi as a Deck is that you have 2.5 playable Main Deck monsters in addition to almost all of its cards locking you into Mayakashi monsters from the Extra Deck. The Deck is just tragic, especially in the face of literally any piece of interruption. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Playing Mayakashi in Genesys is a whole other story. The biggest thing that Mayakashi loses out on from how Genesys Format works is not being able to use Link Monsters. And that is a big issue because most of your plays on your opponent's turn rely on you having cycled through your Mayakashi Link Monsters. Luckily, this doesn't outright kill the Deck. If anything, I feel like playing Mayakashi in Genesys Format is very similar to playing Mayakashi in a Master Duel Synchro Festival, which I have done many times when I still played that game. You are essentially aiming to Synchro climb through all of your Mayakashi Synchro Monsters and set a bunch of reborn Traps with the addition of some number of handtraps in your hand. The only difference is that the playing field between a Master Duel Synchro Fest and Genesys Format are two completely different worlds. The Genesys Points System does not save Mayakashi from Decks that have the ability to play a lot of non-engine. Sure, it is somewhat better here compared to Master Duel, but at the same time, you need to remember that your own ability to include handtraps and other non-engine is also limited by the Points System, not to mention that Mayakashi is still a Deck that loses to a small breeze.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">I don't think playing Eldlich Mayakashi is the way to go for Genesys. Eldlich just isn't that good, especially since it doesn't have many proactive plays when you are starting your turn other than&nbsp;<strong>Eldlich the Golden Lord</strong>'s effect in hand. We are still going to be playing the Golden Lord, but we are playing him because we are playing <strong>Delta of Invitation</strong>, not because we are playing an actual Eldlich Deck. Delta of Invitation is probably one of the best cards that Mayakashi could've ever gotten. This is because it can Special Summon a Level 5 Token if a Zombie monster is on field in addition to sending a Level 5 or higher Zombie from Deck to GY on activation. How is this relevant? When you activate Delta, you can send <strong>Alghoul Mazera</strong> from Deck to GY, which is a card that can banish itself from hand or GY to protect your Zombie monster(s) from bing destroyed by battle or card effect. But if it is banished from hand or GY, you can Special Summon it and then choose to reduce its Level by 1. It's free fodder to banish from GY to reborn your Mayakashi Synchro Monsters that can bring itself back as a large, Level 7 body. The Level 7 is important because it can then Synchro with <strong>Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi</strong> to put another <strong>Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi</strong> into rotation. But let's go back to Delta Summoning a Level 5 Token. Again, If you draw Dakki, you can Normal Summon her and then Special Summon said Level 5 Token to immediately go into <strong>Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi</strong> and start Synchro climbing from there. Tengu is your second best Mayakashi monster, and one that&nbsp; you definitely want to put into rotation. From there, you will be climbing into Yoko and then <strong>Gashadokuro</strong><strong>, the Skeletal Mayakashi</strong> who is just a beater if anything. This means that <strong>Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi</strong> is not our only way to Synchro Climb in the Deck as Dakki or <strong>Shiranui Solitaire</strong> for Dakki alongside Delta also gets you there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Golden Lord is just a good send off of Delta since he can bring himself back as a big beater that cannot be destroyed by card effects for some turns, and his in-hand effect is also nice, being able to send a card on field to GY.&nbsp;<strong>Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi</strong> is alright, but you really have to be careful about when you are Special Summoning her. If you want to go into your non-Mayakashi monsters in your Extra Deck, you need to have a way to get Yuki-Musume off the field first because she locks you into Mayakashi monsters from the Extra Deck. She is here because if you draw her and Dakki, it is very similar to drawing Dakki plus Delta except that you can Synchro Climb starting with&nbsp;<strong>Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi</strong> first in addition to sending Mazera or Eldlich. Hajun is Hajun. For Traps, I am playing 2&nbsp;<strong>Mayakashi Metamorphosis</strong> because we need a way to recur our Mayakashi monsters from GY, but more importantly from banishment. 3&nbsp;<strong>Back to the Front</strong> which very simply just Special Summons a monster from your GY in Defense, which does trigger your Synchro Monsters' effects. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> because we can&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick&nbsp;</strong>for it and it is just good removal in general. 2&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong> which is here because it has a good point value that fits the remainder of the points I had left available for the Deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck, we are playing 1&nbsp;<strong>Snake-Eyes Vengeance Dragon</strong> because you can make it on a following turn with Eldlich and Dakki and it is just a really good card. 1&nbsp;<strong>Shiranui Sunsaga</strong> which returns any number of your Zombie Synchros in banishment or GY to the Extra Deck and pop the same number of your opponent's cards. Very good card that you can get to off of Mazera plus Dakki (if you did not reduce Mazera's Level by 1), but you need to make sure that you have game when you Summon him because you are basically getting rid of all of your GY set-up with his effect. 1 Gashadokuro because he is literally just a beater and the worst Mayakashi Synchro (yes, even worse than Oboro-Guruma). 3 Yoko because its the best Mayakashi Synchro as it can nontargeting pop a card on field after being Special Summoned from GY. 2 Tengu which is the second best Mayakashi Synchro, but its a nontargeting Spell/Trap pop instead. 2 Tsuchigumo and 2 Oboro-Guruma. They help with clearing Hajun and Yuki-Musume off the field in addition to helping you Synchro Climb.&nbsp; 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer&nbsp;</strong>targets:&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Golden Cloud Beast - Malong</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3 Kaijus because good. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</strong> and the third copy of&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</strong>. And then 3&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong>, the 2&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">If you want to change some things around, I would recommend getting rid of the second Purulia and the Judgments to play a set of&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> and 2&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> alongside a third Golden Lord. Mayakashi is not a great Genesys Deck because you are basically playing the Deck at half power because no Link Monsters meaning not being able to play any of the 3 Yuki-Onnas. It's playable, but don't expect to go too far with it.&nbsp;</span></p>"

MWTM, Eldlich, and Horus.</p><p>There are roughly 19 starters that can really start to pop off with just that one card. So in a 60 card deck you have an 88% chance to draw at least one starter on turn 1, and a 91% to draw at least one if going second. This deck is very flexible and can mix and match routes depending on what you want to do/what you draw. Man with the Mark is an amazing engine for going first or second. It is incredibly consistent, allowing you to pop off with 1.5 cards (need something to set to get the search off) and go into full power boards. Everyone knows about the control/stun aspect of MWTM, but it can really thrive as a going second board breaking strat with Divine Scorpion Beast of Serket. Defense of the Temple is like a mini Super Poly. And on top of that, Fusion Serket banishes a face-up card on summon (or from the GY). So With one summon, you can potentially get rid of two monsters. Without targeting, or destroying. Then you get to attack twice with your beefed up dude.</p><p>This deck has the power to blow its load immediatly and spit everything out at once if it wants to, but that isn't the best method. The board can easily get clogged if you just go nuts with combos. Lots of trap monsters that kind of become useless after a certain point. Besides using them for extra deck plays, I have powerful cards like Forbidden Droplet (I'd run two if I had the points), Enemy Controller, and Infernal Punisher to clear my board and cripple my opponent or advance my board state with a lvl 6 tuner.</p><p>Aside from the main engines in this deck, it consists of board breakers, some minor handtraps (ghost belle is protection against opposing D.D. Crow), disruption, and some combo extenders. My Dinosaur engine is f*cking bonkers, I swear they made it just for me.</p><p>Extra deck space is crazy tight. A lot of good cards that I wanted cost around 10-20 points, so had to comprimise on a few. Star of the show for me currently is Snake-Eyes vengence dragon. Super consistent to get out turn one with your main MWTM combo and either a Ground Xeno or Infernal Punisher. Also can be made with the Eldlich trap monsters (as well as the field spell tokens) and the Blackwing tuner. Time Thief Redoer would be great with trap monsters as material, but I had to cut him to make room for others. Rank 4s aren't super common in this deck. But the Synchros, Rank 8s and 6s are made constantly. Jinzo is another stand out one in this deck, with its ability to tribute an opponent's monster to destroy another face-up card (as long as a trap is on the field).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck isn't fully fleshed out yet. I don't have anything for specific matchups. Just some strong going first cards, as well as some more going second cards to add in certain matchups.&nbsp;</p><p>Side note: I don't see anyone talking about Swords of Concealing Light. Very strong effect that HAS to be negated against most decks. The entire idea around building this deck was to bait out negates/interuptions. I got so sick of getting ashed/drolled on my MWTM combos when I was playing a pure version of that deck. Sitting with a single MWTM on field and no other plays to make made me feel miserable.</p><p>Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I'm just getting back into Yugioh with Genesys, so I'm not super familiar with every current meta deck. Still learning matchups, but this deck seems to have a good answer to a lot of opposing decks. Win rate has been pretty high. (Playing on YGO Omega)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Without really being able to run a bunch of handtraps, I'm on a bit more engine than I'd usually play. In particular, running 3 Kagero to have to use with the traps<br /><br />I'm not 100% on the handtrap lineup or the specific Ninja build. Could see playing Nib over some of the other non-engine, but already tight on points.<br /><br />Down to single copies of the Fusions to make room. 1 of each doesn't feel great but I'd rather have the flexibility and the deck can recover them back from anything but a facedown banish. Might need to rely more on Quick Effect fusing into Meizen instead of just making him where he will be Kaiju'd.<br /><br />Side deck is a bit whatever right now. The only card that realistically turns on Dragon's Mind is Meizen.<br /><br />This was originally an old Notebook list but I can't stand drawing that card with nothing to pitch off it.

Is it good? Probably not. But it's a lot of fun though.</p><p>Diabell Vengeance is an insane boss monster. So I decided to play this turbo going 2nd version to pick boards apart with alarming ease. The Magician Souls is a fantastic card to bait interaction pre-emptively. If it resolves, you win the duel. The lower power level of Genesys means that your opponent ends of less disruption so you can chew through boards with good hands. A really fun play with this deck is to use Sinful Spoils of the White Forest to hard Fusion Summon Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon using Snake-Eyes Diabellstar, which is searchable in this deck.</p><p>Just avoid Odion decks ... and Droll &amp; Lock Bird ... and don't brick.&nbsp;</p>"

I played YGO in 2019-2021 and one of my main decks was Burning Abyss with Block Dragon and Warrior Enginge. Seeing Genesys format being announced made me jump into trying to make Burning somewhat fun and good. Sadly while making the deck and trying it out I got rid of the main warrior cards and only left those that are viable. I have yet to be more accurate with my test hands and everything, but if I can, I will edit it if I make changes and also just tell feedback. I've seen people saying it's nothing good, but I see it have potential. The only potential thread as a staple I could think of is Dimenshion Shifter, but it would suck for people to use their points for hand traps ( since why i used a free one lol), but outside of it, idk if there's many other problems and it could go into more than a negate. Hope someone finds it fun to try it out!</p>"

Normal your rose dragon and get out Black Rose Garden. Your Rose dragons need to either search White Rose Dragon or Vengeful Witch.</p><p>2) Sync Rage Rose Witch, send Bramble Rose and Glow up Bulb. Special the glow up bulb and the level 4 you searched.<br /><br />3) Sync Garden Rose Maiden, search Black Garden. Vengeful witch will trigger, special out Twilight Rose Black Knight, use its effect to special Glow Up bulb.</p><p>3.5) Activate Black Garden. Do not forget this.</p><p>4) Sync with the Garden Rose Maiden and the Glow Up Bulb into Mind Castlin. Activate Black Knight's effect to lower mind castlin's level by 1 (It is now a plant thanks to Black Rose Garden).&nbsp;</p><p>5) Sync with the Garden Rose Maiden and the black knight to summon Beelze. Activate the effect of Mind Castlin to swap the Beelze with a rose token on your opponent's board.</p><p>6) You should have a way to get a level 3 tuner on the board, either through the bramble rose or garden rose in GY, or red rose leaving a roxrose on the board.</p><p>7) Sync with the token you took and the level 3 tuner to summon Garden Rose Flora. Flora effect to send Black Garden and special another rose token.</p><p>8) Sync Flora with the token to summon a second copy of Bramble Rose Dragon.<br /><br />9) Destroy your own black rose garden through MST.</p><p>10) The mandatory effect of Black rose garden deals damage to your opponent. When your opponent takes damage, Beelze must activate to gain attack points. Bramble then Activates because your opponent activated an effect to deal 600 damage. Repeat til FTK!<br /><br /><br />You can play through a decent amount in this combo, as you can use some of the leftover pieces for additional ways to continue the combo if you get hand trapped. You cannot perform the FTK if you can't get glow up bulb in the gy and a special summon of black knight, but you can still build a strong board with a decent amount of interaction (Radiant typhoon cards, Genex Ally Zero, and destroying your opponent's board with bramble rose). The rose dragons are strong at playing through Droll &amp; Lock bird, which is popular in Genesys right now.<br /><br />tl;dr konami set mind castlin or beelze to 100 please.</p>"

My answer is that I don't really know. I am not the most experienced player, and I&rsquo;m mostly posting this because I need some suggestions (especially for the ratios, what to cut from the deck, and the side and extra deck compositions). I will try to explain my thought process behind some of the wackier decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1 - What is the general objective of this deck?</strong></p><p>This is a Link-less EARTH Machine deck. It takes advantage of synergies between Infinitrack and Machina monsters, as well as other EARTH Machine monsters, to create a deck with good consistency and high OTK potential. Compared to the TCG, the lack of Link monsters hurts its combo potential, but thanks to the core of the deck costing zero points, we have room for strong support cards such as hand traps and board breakers.</p><p>The general plan is to play on turn one, generate a moderately resilient board, and then OTK on turn three. We are also well-equipped for going second, with a large number of hand traps and board breakers to try to win the game on turn two. In fact, based on a hypergeometric calculator, we have more than a 75% chance of opening at least one board breaker or hand trap in the initial hand (if we count Urgent Schedule as a board breaker, which I will soon explain how it works).</p><p>The deck is not very linear and some decisions, such as what to add with <a class=""type-union-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=42940404"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/42940404.jpg"" data-card=""42940404"" data-name=""Machina Gearframe"">Machina Gearframe</span></a>, send with <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=45674286"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/45674286.jpg"" data-card=""45674286"" data-name=""Machina Unclaspare"">Machina Unclaspare</span></a> or search with <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=24701066"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24701066.jpg"" data-card=""24701066"" data-name=""Infinitrack River Stormer"">Infinitrack River Stormer</span></a> &nbsp;depends on your hand&nbsp; and the board state.</p><p>The side deck provides tools to deal with backrow-heavy decks as well as some consistency options.

A few synergies that encouraged me to mix these engines:<br /><br />1) The Metalmorph monsters need a Warrior/Fiend/Dragon, which matches the typing for 3 of the 5 Regenesis monsters, allowing you to make them either as a pivot off of something like DRNM after going first. Tributing the Regenesis monsters for a trap on your opponent's turn also sets them up to be returned to your hand via their own effects in the opponent's end phase.<br /><br />2) Running Regenesis monsters for our main engine allows us not only to play with a pretty flexible engine, but also incorporate something like Dogmatika to break our opponent's boards or interrupt them when they're going first, as both Fleurdelis cards have 2500 ATK and DEF and can be used to bring out Archfiend or Lord. In addition, Lava Golem and Metalflame Swordsman both have a 2500 statline that can be used to bring out Archfiend.<br /><br />3) The flexibility of this engine allows you to comfortably play second and go for board breakers in the form of cards like Ultimate Slayer, Gordian Slicer, and Lava Golem, make easy Rank 8 plays off of monsters from all 3 engines for cards like Garunix, Azure-Eyes, or Dingirsu, and when going first you can comfortably set up 3-5 forms of interaction with several coming from your own engine. The Dogmatika trap cards do lock you out of extra deck usage after using them, but you'll still have games where you won't be able to activate either of them and still need to be able to break a board.<br /><br />Extra deck and side could probably use work and be tailored to your preference- Five Headed Dragon is just there for high ATK targets for Dogmatika Punishment.<br /><br />All-in-all, a pretty fun deck so far from my playing of it!

It's too expensive and the deck is already too fragile without being able to put in any relevant interaction. Flame Swordsman engine is a one card combo that allows you to get a Quick effect Destruction and big damage without using up your normal. Called By The Grave and Forbidden Droplets make up the most of the pointed cards because this deck can be vulnerable to interruption and dies to quite a few relevant hand traps. Ricci enables Crimson Blader but also is a free special summon of any level 4. Dempsey either searches your whole monster lineup or an extra piece of interruption with the counter trap. Not any real one card combos, but you have enough searchers and starters that your more likely than not to have what you need to get your board setup. Your endboard ideally ends on Gearfried, Charles and Ultimate FS with an equip on (though more likely you'll wind up with 2 of those three). But you can be flexible.&nbsp;</p>"

Ever wanted to Refill all the bricks in your hand?,"<p>* The adamancipator tuners let you dig for low level rocks. Supplier lets you add Guardian, Xenoguitar recycles from grave, Dragite draws, and carthoryn is a level 2 (make a 6 with analyzer for Raptite). Dragite is a strong synchro, as is Accel Stardust Dragon. Ruddy Rose sometimes just wins games but if you can help it don't banish your own block dragon with it.</p><p>* making a rank 4 gets you gallant granite, searches block dragon. All the small megaliths can be used for this, as well as most of your maindeck rocks</p><p>*only the search on block dragon is once per turn. This card is absolutely Diabolical. You can search all 3 adamancipator tuners with it at once, or Phul/Ophiel/Researcher</p><p>*Big megaliths are ritual spells in the hand. you need aratron, phaleg, or bethor to start most megalith plays. Aratron is a quick effect, bethor has the best on field effect when summoned (often by using Phul), phaleg is an extra name. If you want yoou can cut phaleg to play a second Bethor, this may be better tbh</p><p>*If no Big Megaliths are avaliable, Unformed [NOT ONCE PER TURN] can summon ophiel from deck by summoning 8 levels worth of monsters. It kinda stings to do but its fine because Hagith can search another spell&nbsp;</p><p>*Ophiel searches hagith which searches unformed which tributes hagith for phul, which puts Phul (BEST CARD IN THE ARCHETYPE BTW) on field. Phul recycles a GY ritual into the hand, and copies its level [PERMANANTLY]. Phul can use itself or anything in hand to ritual summon any Megalith from hand or deck as a quick effect. Bethor is the best target for this, mass destruction on summon</p><p>*you normally do not want to tribute the Phul on field by its own effect during your turn</p><p>*Ending on Aratron kinda sucks because its negate isnt nearly as good as you want it to be, but it IS a quick effect ritual spell in hand during your opponents turn</p><p>*Notrah Plura is the boss monster you want. Its a solid negate and your only maindeck monster with exceptional attack.</p><p>*Anastasis is an absolutely diabolical spell. On activation , discard 1 to search a big and a small megalith and you're off to the races. When you ritual summon you can either draw 2/Discard 1, or TRIBUTE ONE OPPONENTS MONSTER. on your turn use the draw to get into all your adamancipators and during the opponents turn, use a High Level Phul to tribute itself for Notrah plura [or aratron or phaleg if you don't have the levels], then tribute an oppoments monster with Anastasis [NON TARGETING, NON DESTRUCTION]</p><p>*Notrah plura's hand effect is just okay. also its negate can sometimes tribute an opponents monster but don't count on it all the time</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You can make this deck significantly cheaper by cutting the Seventh spells and playing 3 Pot of Extravagance plus any two other cards instead, at which point you just tweak the extra deck to be all three-ofs. A few important things to note: The Vernusylphs lock you into Earth monster EFFECTS, not Earth monsters, so you can use them to make generic rank 4's even if you can't use their effects right away, which makes Redoer and Tornado Dragon more viable. Also, not only are the Ishizu cards extenders and disruption, you can also use them to empty your own graveyard to make Petingcessoeur's special summon live, or to proc Chocolat-a-la-Mode, Glassouffle, Ticket, and Salon's effects.</p>"

After which you exchange an opponent's monster with one of your dark fiends, and attack into it with a two tribute (or five if you want I can't tell you how to live) summoned Exodia. Kind of like a thoracle win for those MTG Commander players out there. Unlike regular exodia you don't have to play five garnets.

The main strength of this deck is its ability to cheat out Brute Blues with the easily searched Stage Landing spell card, OTK or just about OTK by resolving Pile Bunker, and its ability to survive via banishing Stage Landing and Last Stand. You can pitch either from the deck by resolving a summon of Lambda Blade, which you can accomplish by summoning Shepherd's Crook, setting Last Stand, and resolving it during your opponent's draw/standby phase. Lambda Blade itself provides a powerful form of play disruption, and you can increase your chances of resolving any card successfully by activating Next Phase. Also, read the main deck Appliancers, if you start with the field spell and one of the two Appliancer main deck monsters, you get three bodies on the field to start slamming your extra deck and resolving VALCan Booster. The ideal starting hand is probably something close to Appliancer field spell, Appliancer main deck monster, a special summon eff. R.B. main deck monster, Stage Landing, and Ash/Gogre. Also, Laundry Dragon is adorable and can be positioned for either banishing what it battles, or burning for the attack value of what it battles. Fun little guy.<br /><br />The side deck I listed doesn't matter too much, just run what you think would be good based off of first principles. Probably don't run Dark Ruler No More though.</p>"

While the pure Fire King may seem deceptively simple and therefore, weak - it is surprisingly potent in Masterduel's meta. Nearly every card triggers floating effects either from hand, deck or GY. Special summons can be played minimally in this deck to combat Maxx ""C,"" or the deck can combo off with Promethean Princess to a Fire Link 4 fairly competently for a more powerful board. Fire Kings can also generate a ton of advantage and ATK power extremely quickly. The deck also has natural ways to combat the ever common backrow floodgates through Fire King Sky Burn. Fire King monsters on the field can also reliably dodge targeting effects because quick effect in-archetype cards like Sky Burn, Circle of Fire Kings and High Avatar Kirin all destroy your monsters.</p><p>Piloted correctly, Fire Kings basically has no ""bad match-ups"" in today's metagame, since it basically has answers to everything. Played ""pure,"" Fire Kings might not have as much power as Maliss, Ryzeal or Mitsurugi, but it makes up for it with its versatility, adaptability and grindgame. All in all, Fire Kings played as a ""pure"" deck remains a solid meta choice for Masterduel ladder!&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

And even if you fail to OTK, you still break the board and can pivot to a 2-3 interaction endboard that has a good chance of beating whatever cards your opponent has remaining.</p><p>FTKs are scary, but this deck has two ways to deal with that - either choose to go first and side in the 6 engine cards in the extra (first 6, swap Duster/Lightning Storm/Raigeki) for a ~5 interaction endboard, or side in Droll + Imperm to try to handtrap the FTK component (currently, imperm the XYZ) so you can still OTK through what's left.</p><p>----</p><p>The maindeck is cut down to 4 R.B. parts + Last Stand to minimize bricks, because you really need as much of your starting hand to be live as possible to break the really tough endboards. A 5th part (either Cannon or Rocket, depending on matchup) does increase the ceiling in exchange for reducing the odds of drawing enough live cards to break the board. I couldn't cut Last Stand because you do need some kinda trap as a backup plan if you don't successfully OTK, and you can sometimes make it a live negate by sending it off Droplet.</p><p>Also yeah, deck still dies to Droll, sadly.</p>"

I'm skipping out on Sinful Spoils/Azamina engine to give myself lots of points to spend on Chicken Game, because its a very fun card to use with the White Forest engine, as well as luxury handtraps like Ash Blossom and Droll, since this deck can draw into non-engine very easily over the course of a turn. I'm also running two Filia Diabell in the main deck to help if I lose coin toss, which I can side in or out as needed.

Breaking backrow is not really a weakness of this deck, espceially on 3 MST in main. You MUST run 2 Fonix if you are trying to OTK with Typhoon, lacking atk points otherwise. 3x Slayer in main is the only card you don't really want to see going first, but essentially any quick play spell plus any archetypal monster are full combo. Generaider rank 9 is probably the best single play the deck has access to, but you have to be really careful about not getting locked out of it, Krosea and Meg both wind-lock the extra.</p>"

I jumped on the <em>Orcust</em> bandwagon... It all started when I pulled a Royal Rare Girsu in a Legacy Pack in 2024 and tried to make it work with <em>Jinzo</em>, <em>Knightmare</em>, etc. Needless to say my efforts were next to futile, but managed to reach Plat before the recent support and found the gameplay loop for the deck to be quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<br /><br />This archetype first released in 2018 and has a bit of a cult following since then. The archetype itself shares a beautifully written lore that features archtypes like <em>World Legacy</em>,&nbsp;<em>Knightmare</em>, <em>Crusadia</em>, <em>Mekk-Knights&nbsp;</em>and even&nbsp;<em>Krawlers</em>! (spoilers: it's sad as f*ck)&nbsp;<br /><br />This deck focuses on DARK Machines and Banishing which is really comfortable given we're <strong>still</strong> in&nbsp;<em>Maliss </em>meta.

Any card that sends to grave for cost or resolution is going to work some magic for your Orcust pieces. The only difference now is that they're all One-Card Combos :DDDDD thanks to the addition of <strong>Galatea-I</strong>. Before, you'd have to pray they didn't have anything to counter&nbsp;<strong>Girsu&nbsp;</strong>dumping a piece to the grave on top of running some of the most resource-heavy cards just to fasciliate your plays. The deck was... not in a good spot before this support dropped, unfortunately...&nbsp;<br /><br />**That said, here's an example of what an ideal hand can accomplish:&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>In Hand: [Dark World Dealings], [Orcust Harp Horror], [Orcust Knightmare], [Orcustrated Babel],&nbsp;</strong>Any non-engine/handtrap</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">*(This deck can play around a lot so I'm adding subpoints as alternative routes just in case)</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Activate <strong>Dealings -&gt; </strong>Send&nbsp;<strong>Harp Horror</strong> (be sure to check their graveyard for deck knowledge as it could be important)&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 1a.</strong> If <strong>Harp Horror&nbsp;</strong>gets <strong>Ash</strong>'d, you could always Normal Summon <strong>Girsu</strong> (if you have one in hand) and go from there, ideal dump on ETB would&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be <strong>Cymbal Skeleton</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Activate <strong>Harp Horror&nbsp;</strong>in grave. Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Girsu</strong>. Resolve <strong>Girsu </strong>ETB effect dumping <strong>Cymbal Skeleton</strong>. Activate <strong>Girsu's </strong><em>second effect </em>to create a Token on both sides of the field. From here, you can either use the Token, OR&nbsp;<strong>Girsu </strong>themselves in order to conduct the next summon.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 2a. </strong>Ideally, using&nbsp;<strong>Girsu&nbsp;</strong>is recommended as, if all else fails, you can Link off the token for a&nbsp;<strong>[Linkuriboh]&nbsp;</strong>in order to soften the blow for a potential&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn 3 comeback.<br /><br /><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Galatea-I&nbsp;</strong>(the art is so cuuuuuute!)

Follow this up with activating <strong>Cymbal Skeleton&nbsp;</strong>in grave to bring back our favorite sadboi:&nbsp;<strong>Girsu.&nbsp;</strong>(Sorry, spoilers...)&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>Much like the storyline, we're going to Link off&nbsp;<strong>Galatea-I&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Girsu&nbsp;</strong>in order to summon&nbsp;<strong>Galatea</strong> (the other one.)

Not only that, we can also banish&nbsp;<strong>World Wand</strong>, in order to Special Summon an <em>Orcust</em> monster from the Banishment. <br /><br /><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>By this point, you should have 4 bodies on board:&nbsp;<strong>Galatea, Orcust from Banishment, World Crown&nbsp;</strong>and a <strong>[Linkuriboh]</strong>. (Sweet Slifer, praying they don't have a Nibiru.) From here, Link off everything, except the <strong>Kuriboh</strong>, to summon our stylish new boss monster: <strong>[Enlilgirsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight] </strong>(OH NO, HE'S HOT)&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>FINALLY, Activate&nbsp;<strong>[Orchestrated Babel]</strong>, set&nbsp;<strong>Crescendo</strong> alongside any counters you might've drawn from&nbsp;<strong>Dealings</strong> and pass.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>- Board Complete!!! -&nbsp;</strong></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Follow-Ups &amp; Tech</strong></span>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The endboard might look a little light as this isn't the correct line to go, but there are SOOO many points of interaction outside of the endboard alone. Typically, it's recommended to play <em>Orcust</em> alongside another archetype that enables more options, but I prefer the pure build as it maintains a steady resource loop alongside my favorite thing in the world, recursion.&nbsp;<br /><br />With <strong>Babel </strong>on the field&nbsp;<em>ALL&nbsp;</em>of your&nbsp;<em>Orcust</em> monster effects are Quick-Plays including the Links in grave and on the field! Insane! I know! Meaning,&nbsp;<strong>Enlilgirsu's&nbsp;</strong>effects of adding a Banished&nbsp;<em>Orcust&nbsp;</em>or <em>World Legacy&nbsp;</em>card back to hand and sending it to the deck in order to steal adds a point of interruption. Mind you, it's stolen <em>permanently&nbsp;</em>so be sure to choose wisely.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alongside Handtraps and Staples, you have a&nbsp;<em>ton</em> in your arsenal in order to make your opponent's turn,&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>annoying.&nbsp;<br /><br />The example hand is merely a straight shot to&nbsp;<strong>Enlilgirsu</strong>, however I've managed to summon&nbsp;<strong>Dingirsu&nbsp;</strong>consistently even after being interrupted numerous times.<br /><br />As far as card choice goes,&nbsp;elephant in the room, I know <strong>[Dark World Dealings]</strong> is a questionable pick as it kind of gives the opponent an advantage in either drawing a combo piece or some interruption, however... deck knowledge is huge and, much like 90% of the deck, it can bait an&nbsp;<strong>Ash.</strong> If it's not your cup of tea, feel free to add an additional&nbsp;<strong>Impulse </strong>and <strong>Imperm</strong>.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Sideboard</span>:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">This sideboard is mostly centered around handtrap additions and potential alternative lines for extension.

Though, can't help but to hardstick myself in Plat playtesting these strats.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Still, much like the story, you're able to slot in a good majority of&nbsp;<em>World Legacy</em>, <em>World Chalice&nbsp;</em>and <em>Mekk-Knights&nbsp;</em>as those archetypes surprisingly compliment&nbsp;<em>Orcust&nbsp;</em>to a certain degree.

Was so tempted to dismantle <em>Orcust</em> for other stuff, but these new additions have made me fall in love all over again. It sits in the Rogue catagory, as it still loses to a lot of points of interaction, sadly, but I definitely recommend playing around with it as it can be splashed with almost any DARK archetype. Though, most slottable archetypes that don't xeno-lock you would be just as fine as well.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><hr /><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">FOLLOW ME ON MASTER DUEL FOR ROGUE/MEME/NON-META NONSENSE&nbsp;<br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"" />181-209-956&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;""><br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"" />Also, feel free to use my campaign code in case you have a fresh account, or are just starting out: 00cdab64</p>"

I can at least still run most of the traps i like to run. The only thing im still on the fence on is if N'tss is worth having over a singlur Trap Holic, but being able to pop a monster with Punisment, and another card by throwing N'tss away is just to much fun. I mostly prefer using evacuation Device instead of Get Out because I normally come into cases where i could have just used it over Get Out more common, but i do see it as the better option if you know youre going into a matchup that its strong against. And you can use Alert if your Rexterm gets poped to recur it, or you can go into a Laggia for extra safety against spells/traps, or even go into Rebellion for a way to go in for game instead. The only things id like to do if some points get changed around would be subsitute a Traptrick with Trap Holic instead, but other than that, add Daruma Cannon if it didnt also cost me points. Lilith is also a good option, but Wannabee! is just too cute! and you could honestly just swap D.D. Crow out for lilith if you are having consistancy issues, or just want to spam more traps. And you could use a copy or 2 of Reversion to use it as another one of your counter traps like Intact or Iron Thunder, but I didnt want to go over 40 cards, and seeing as how it only works after you use the counter traps first makes it a little clunky at times.</p>"

I was extremely surprised at how... WELL... the two archetypes blend together especially with the Doomed and Vengance Dragon.</p><p>The video in question:</p><p><a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4y94pjSNUk</a></p><p>To cut to the chase you're summoning vanilla Flame Swordsman attached with both the Flying and the Fighting Flame Dragon which can then lead to the Doomed Dragon. Alternatively you have your Tenpai stuff which does the usual Tenpai thing. Black Rose for board breaks, so on and so forth. Its simple but honestly really fun and if anyone has any ideas to take this further please let me know. I personally added Dark Flare to the deck however I assume the only reason peeps didn't have it in this video is cause its not in Master Duel for some odd reason. Either way that brings the total to 9 copies of Fighting Flame Swordsman which means that 9 chances to draw into your one card starter. Of course the Flame Swordsman stuff is the main part of this deck but having Tenpai in here really makes the deck a lot more fun in my opinion.</p>"

The only ""Branded"" cards in this decklist comprise of only 4 cards, double Branded Fusion, 1 Albaz and 1 Cartesia. The 40-card variant of this strategy trades the inherent gas of the Branded cards for a an incredible amount of non-engine staples - 15! So with triple Faimena, this brings the handtrap count to 18 so you can bring your opponent's plays to a standstill where you can easily smash through their half-board. Post-side, the deck can take out 7 cards (all Dracotail traps and the entire Branded engine) to play up to 25 handtraps! Personally, I like the 60-card version of this deck better, I like playing with a high power ceiling and making gigantic Branded boards.&nbsp;<br /><br />Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! Before Phryxul's release from DOOD, the Branded Dracotail player would be forced instead to go to Lubellion by sending Mululu and Albaz, which may search a Dracotail spell/trap, but neglects searching for a Branded spell/trap because of the lack of Albion. Forget Phryxul's effects for a second, her most important characteristic is her attribute - LIGHT! This allows Branded Fusion to fusion summon Albion using Phyxul and Albaz, allowing you to simultanously search a Dracotail spell/trap and a Branded spell/trap during the End Phase (aka Main Phase 3 for Branded players)!<br /><br />As a result, Branded Dracotail is now a much more synergistic fusion of both archetypes! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s card effects. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deus-X Krawler </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute. 2</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which can Special Summon itself from hand if there is a monster in the EMZ. Also, you can target 1 face-up monster in the EMZ and equip that monster to Kaku, and if Kaku destroys a monster by battle, you can Special Summon a Monster Card that is equipped to it. I really like Kaku. Other than being basically a Level 9 you can freely Special Summon from hand, granted that there is a monster in the EMZ, it can also act as removal for a monster from the EMZ. And, it has a high ATK stat to run things over which allows it to Special Summon the monster it removed from the EMZ and equipped to itself. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Turbo-Tained Hotrod GT19</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Its Flip Effect allows you to declare a Level from 1 to 9 and change Hotrod&rsquo;s Level to the declared Level for the turn. Also, after it has been flipped face-up, during any Main Phase afterwards, it can Quick Effect target 1 other monster on either field to Quick Synchro using itself and that monster. Notably, this card is 1 effect per turn and only once that turn. As cool as Hotrod is, the 1 effect per turn and only once that turn clause absolutely ruins the card. You are so limited in what you are able to make with it because you cannot Level modulate and Quick Synchro in the same turn. I didn&rsquo;t realize this in my Synchro Prediction Princess Deck and I apologize, but the card is still usable except that it is much worse than anticipated. And it is not like you can preemptively flip it face-up to modulate its Level to then Quick Synchro on another turn because the Level modulation is until the end of the turn. So, you are going to have to use it as a Level 3 Tuner. Yes, it can use a monster your opponent controls to Synchro Summon, but at the same time, you will be depending on your opponent Summoning a monster with a Level that you can actually target with Hotrod to Synchro Summon with.

Let&rsquo;s say that you did not draw Monstrosity or Kaku, but you do have Psi-Reflector (which is most of the time considering how many cards search it). When you bring back Assault Beast by revealing AMA in hand, you can increase its Level by 3 to make it a 7 instead of an 8 so that you can go into Night Wing Priestess. Priestess can then set AMA and have it immediately activatable, but you would want to have Assault Zone on field as well so that you can pay 2000 LP to tribute Crimson Blader from Extra Deck with AMA for Crimson Blader/AM. And then, you can discard a card to Summon Psi-Refector to Synchro with it into Crocodragon for a piece of interaction. Or, if&nbsp; you are playing Assault Lich, you can grab that from the Deck to Synchro with Night Wing Priestess into Vengeance Dragon.
