Here this monster is the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> which is so old that I remember using this card over 12 years ago. Other decks that work with this theme are: Dinosaur structure deck that plays around the <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> card and the <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon"">Thunder Dragon</a> deck that was made to support the iconic early game card. The Nephthys deck works on the <strong>basis of Ritual Summon mechanics and has good Ritual monsters</strong> which already makes it a decent deck since when it comes to Ritual Summon if the deck cannot <strong>generate an advantage while Ritual Summoning it practically becomes unplayable</strong> but this is not the case with Nephthys. This archetype preserves some characteristics found on the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> card mainly the fact that they <strong>work by destroying your cards to use their effects</strong> and also <strong>have effects when they are destroyed</strong>. The biggest problem with the Nephthys deck is that they copied the Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys part of <strong>activating their effects on the GY only on their next Standby Phase</strong> which makes them slow cards for Yugioh! Modern. However, we are talking about the use of this deck in NR format and here the Nephthys deck is not that slow, even having a competitive attachment.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Nephthys Gameplay Details</strong>:  <strong>The main idea of ​​the deck is to make the following combo:</strong> - Use <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> eff to add the missing combo piece to the hand either <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> which can be added with both cards or Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> which can be added by Manju. - Having the Ritual spell and monster you <strong>Ritual Summon</strong> <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a>. Then use Devotee eff and special <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> <strong>straight from the deck</strong>. (If you already control Disciple and used effect on turn you can bring it to <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> or <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> from Deck) - Disciple is the <strong>ROTA of both Monster and Spell/Trap</strong>. In this case the monster you add is the <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> (Follow Up) but it depends on the rest of your hand. - Use Disciple and Devotee to <strong>LINK-2</strong> <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver"">Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver</a> and eff to Add <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> (single target possible) from Deck and Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> from GY. - Using <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> eff destroys <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> in Hand to Special itself and the Sacred Phoenix <strong>already comes into circulation on returning from GY in the Standby Phase</strong> of your next turn <strong>destroying all the backrow on the field</strong>.  If you use <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> itself to Ritual Summon Devotee you <strong>get an additional pop</strong> from the Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> so always <strong>try to capitalize on that play</strong> by Ritual Summoning and surprising your opponent by <strong>destroying their cards</strong> without targeting.  One way to take advantage of <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> is with SPELL <a data-name=""Last Hope of Nephthys"">Last Hope of Nephthys</a> destroying it and an opponent's card. If you have <strong>2 Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys in the GY that were destroyed</strong> and you are in your Standby Phase, what happens will be that <strong>both of them return to the field with their mandatory effects</strong> and activate their mandatory effect to destroy the spells/traps on the field as well. In this NR format build, arriving at the <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> <strong>Ritual Summon is the main move to be made</strong>, so even if you don't come with your hand aligned, always seek to access the missing pieces like Devotee and the Ritual Spell Rebirth of Nephthys as soon.  Cool that you <strong>destroying the Paleozoic Traps in your HAND</strong> to use the <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> effect per example <strong>doesn't generate you any downside</strong> because they come back from the GY <strong>allowing RANK-2 plays</strong>.  <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> allows accessing <strong>RANK-2 moves very easily</strong> so it is common in the grind game to use <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> to add Matriarch to be your Normal Summon. And you can use <strong>Disciple to destroy the Matriarch if you have it in hand</strong> and the Matriarch goes back to the field in the next Standby Phase and <strong>gives Disciple Reborn</strong> if it's in the GY.  The <strong>LINK-2</strong> <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver"">Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver</a> is like a <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> in the sense that it <strong>can give you a Plus 1 if you have a Ritual Spell in your GY</strong> which most of the time you do it you will. And his effect of <strong>destroying a ""Nephthys"" and bringing a different name</strong> instead is very useful to <strong>Loop</strong> the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> during SP to clear Backrow.  <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> <strong>triggers eff from your Nephthys monsters</strong> so losing your board is no problem because your cards have <strong>floating effects</strong> in the Standby Phase.  Interaction with <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> is also very cool because if you gave SS from <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> in the Standby Phase by its own effect and gave Reborn from <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> from GY and made <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> you can use Devotee eff in GY to get <strong>back on Geonator's arrow</strong> and that way you can exchange the control of monsters.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, they are just examples of cards to test in the deck.  &nbsp;"

But the archetype's main card is the <strong>excellent Field Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> that you want access to as soon as possible. In the <strong>N/R format version</strong> many <strong>consistency cards</strong> don't exist so we have to adapt the deck with the best in the format like <a data-name=""Link Apple"">Link Apple</a> which is basically an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> ""free to play"" and <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a> which is 3 more copies from Pacifis, the Phantasm City. (One detail about how <strong>Phantasm Spiral cards work</strong> is that monsters from the Extra Deck with No effect are <strong>not considered Normal monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> or <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a> which is used in the Extra Deck just for decoration because it's correct you <strong>never do them as this disables their interaction traps</strong> like <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> and <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Power"">Phantasm Spiral Power</a>)  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments on cards and deck gameplay:</strong>  One of the biggest problems with this Archetype is that you <strong>have practically no interaction with the opponent until you control a Normal Monster</strong> since almost all spell/traps need this condition in order to activate their effects. And there's the fact that if your opponent is smart he can <strong>easily play around</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> by <strong>not activating any card effects</strong> but trying to win on the basis of Beatdown by putting monsters on the field and going straight to the Battle Phase. That's why I decided to give up using <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> which has the synergy of being a <strong>WATER monster</strong> with the Trap <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> that can banish it to <strong>protect Pacifis,</strong> the Phantasm City from being destroyed to use the <strong>Mekk-Knight engine</strong>: <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a>, these two cards play the role of <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> better since you can <strong>use it on your opponent's turn</strong> and the monster Special Summoned by World Legacy's Memory will be <strong>returned to the hand in the End Phase</strong> which means you can Normal Summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a> on your next turn and <strong>trigger the effect of Pacifis, the Phantasm City</strong> to add another Archetype card and <strong>build pressure on the opponent</strong> faster than compared to Unexpected Dai and Megalosmasher X . The only thing about using <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> is that it conflicts with <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> effect of <strong>creating Token</strong> so it has to be used after creating the Token to Summon Mekk-Knight Avram. <strong>Other synergies of this engine</strong>: <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> makes <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a> even better in the deck because before you <strong>had to choose between Normal Summoning</strong> <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> or <a data-name=""Pathfinder"">Pathfinder</a> but now you have the option to bring Vanilla straight from the deck. And about Mekk-Knight Avram coming back into the hand in the End Phase you get a simple discard way to use <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>. So the improvements in using this engine are better than any other option available in Normal/Rare format.  Basically <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> allows you to catch the opponent off guard when for example you <strong>used the effect of one of the Equip and it is now equipped on the Boss Monster</strong> of the deck and now it's the opponent's turn and he declares an attack on your monster that doesn't have the equip spell, you can activate Trap <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> in the attack declaration and <strong>return the Equip Spell to your monster that is participating in the battle</strong> and take advantage of that battle phase in the opponent's turn.  The <strong>best Equip spell</strong> is <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral WAVE"">Phantasm Spiral WAVE</a> because your monster <strong>doesn't need to have battled an opponent's monster to resolve and bring the boss monster</strong>, as well as forcing the opponent to <strong>discard a card</strong> from their hand.  <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> is the best way to <strong>get rid of the token on the field so you can use the field's effect again to generate advantage and interaction every turn</strong>. Mainly do this on <strong>your turn to enter the Opponent's Turn without Token</strong> if Already have another Normal Monster on the Field. Another Missplay with <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> is not banishing NORMAL Monsters knowing that you will need to use <a data-name=""TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE"">TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE</a>. (Know that using Sea Stealth Attack eff on <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> per example will <strong>count as a monster that returns to the field in the End Phase and not a Special Summon</strong> so you will never get trigger eff from FIELD <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</span> with this effect)  The Field spell <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> </span>basically works like this: The <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Token"">Phantasm Spiral Token</a> <strong>create effect is not once per turn</strong> and the <strong>add effect from deck to hand is MANDATORY</strong>.  The Tenyi Counter Trap <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a> <strong>only negates spell/trap activation and not their effect on the GY</strong> like Eldlich's traps like <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land</a> and True Draco cards like <a data-name=""True Draco Heritage"">True Draco Heritage</a>.  Don't forget how important <a data-name=""Paleozoic"">Paleozoic</a> Traps are in the deck <strong>coming back from the GY as a Normal Monster having a lot of synergy with deck cards</strong> that get dead while a normal monster is not on the field.  <strong>Interaction between Sea Stealth and Paleozoic Traps</strong>: you can activate <a data-name=""Sea &lt;a data-name=&quot;Stealth Sea Attack&quot;&gt;Stealth Attack&lt;/a&gt;"">Sea </a><a data-name=""Stealth Sea Attack"">Stealth Attack</a> and in chain <strong>activate the Paleozoic Traps in GY to gain access to a Normal Monster</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////<strong>Deck issues:</strong>  <strong>Lack of pressure and consistency</strong> due to <strong>reliance on Field Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> alongside cards like <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> to <strong>capitalize on advantage</strong>. So in addition to having a <strong>certain dependence on the opponent's actions</strong>, what you do is <strong>never enough to control the game</strong>, you are always losing until the moment when the opponent's pushes miraculously end and you win.

And I got addicted to <strong>building several decks of this format</strong> because it's an event still <strong>little explored and full of good archetype ideas</strong> to use. The deck I present below is the <strong>improved version</strong> of the first Master Duel Normal/Rare deck I built: https://ygoprodeck.com/battlewasp-ballpark-nr-event-mar22/  Lately I stopped playing Master Duel because I have an error problem that prevents me from playing any game because a window appears that closes the game. I've already talked to the game's support and they gave me a lot of attention but the fact is that even with a print screen and details of how the error happens, I haven't been able to play for almost a month. So I decided to make some deck profiles of decks I had built in Normal/Rare Format and share my latest content related to Master Duel.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /// As I had already explained in the other deck profile the idea behind the deck and the synergies between the main cards used, here I will focus on the interactions I noticed when using the deck in tournaments that allowed me to improve it a lot.  <strong>Shinobi and Gokipole Interaction</strong>: You make the <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a> using the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> as a material and <strong>pointing at an opponent's monster</strong> and the Gokipole uses its Special Summon effect from Vanilla <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> in the zone the Shinobi points to and <strong>destroys the opponent's monster that Shinobi points to</strong> which triggers the Shinobi's eff to give Reborn from <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> for example and you do Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> to end the game. In other situations you can Reborn a Level 3 Insect to make <strong>XYZ Summon rolls</strong>. I've won several games just because of this interaction. Just remember that when making Shinobi using Gokipole and <strong>Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</strong> you don't first bring Gokipole with Shinobi after the opponent's monster is destroyed, but Twinbow because he will be <strong>banished when he leaves the field</strong> and will not use its search effect.  This <strong>same interaction is valid for Puzzlomino and Gokipole</strong>: You make <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a></span> using <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> as material and bring Vanilla <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> </span>in the zone he points and <strong>destroy an opponent's monster</strong> and you will still be <strong>able to manipulate its level to destroy another opponent's monster or make XYZ Summon or Synchro Summon plays</strong>. So <a data-name=""Puzzlomino"">Puzzlomino</a> is another interaction and versatility card available in the Extra Deck when you are not locked in Insects.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /// <strong>Technoplay and Missplays I made with the deck:</strong>  You should think a lot about the best time to use Reborn spell <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> eff in GY to <strong>protect one of your Insect monsters from destruction</strong>. For example I already lost a game because I decided not to protect Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> with it since I had <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> set to use on the opponent's turn.  Another mistake I made a few times was when using the <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> <strong>effect to send to the GY</strong> because the decision to special summon <strong>1, 2 or 3 copies</strong> of <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> is important for example if you <strong>drop 1 Vanilla in the Main Deck on your next turn you will be able to use this special summon effect again</strong>, which in this case would be the 3 Vanillas. So <strong>don't bring the 3 Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder Vanillas straight onto the field the first time you activate the Giant Ballpark effect</strong>. There's also the interaction between Special Summoning 2 Lv4 Vanilla and you do RANK-4 <a data-name=""Insect Number 70: Malevolent Sin"">Insect Number 70: Malevolent Sin</a> and then RANK-5 <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top to have interaction of returning a defense position monster to the deck . Another missplay that you shouldn't commit when using <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> is that its <strong>floating effect of giving Vanilla Reborn is only when an Insect is destroyed by an opponent's card effect</strong>. So first that if you destroy your monsters with <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, Ballpark won't trigger eff from Reborn to Vanilla, and second that it won't trigger eff if the monsters are <strong>destroyed in battle</strong> so think carefully about using this card so you don't missplay in battle phase for example thinking she would give Vanilla Reborn.  MISSPLAY: You have a lot of <strong>cards that need to discard as cost to work</strong> so don't keep <strong>setting cards on the field for no reason</strong> as when you need a discard in your hand to resolve a <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a> or <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a> this mistake will cost you the game. MISSPLAY: You don't summon Synchro 6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> in the Extra Monster Zone Column to <strong>make the Shinobi Co-Linked so the opponent can target him for attacks</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ///  In a format like this N/R with <strong>slower games</strong> and <strong>Spell/Traps based interactions</strong> you should save your Backrow removal as a <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> to use on the right cards. It's not to use Mystical Space Typhoon blindly, for example, but to <strong>wait for the game to develop a little to destroy the correct backrow</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// // <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, they are just examples of interesting cards to test in the deck.  &nbsp;"

I playtested a lot with this deck since DIFO came out. After many games and adaptions this is in my opinion the best decklist currently. Really strong first turn 1 card combo and insane grind game. Just a bit bricky sometimes but it is fine. Definitely recommend to give it a try.

It's a hybrid Tenyi build that focuses on some elements of control but also works to swarm the field with monsters while maintaining a decent hand advantage. To begin, our Tenyi core consists of three <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a>, three <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a>, two <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a>, two <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a>, two <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and two <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a>. For those of you who don't know, the Main-Deck Tenyi monsters all have the effect to special summon from hand while you control no monsters, or all the monsters on your side of the field are Non-Effect. They work to swarm onto the field so you can link climb into their boss monster, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>. If you control at least one Non-Effect monster the Tenyi's will also have a secondary effect. By banishing themselves from hand or grave: Ashuna can summon another Tenyi from the deck, Vishuda can target a card your opponent controls and return it to the hand, Nahata can reduce an opponent's monsters attack by 1500, Mapura can negate a card that target's one of your Non-Effect monsters, Shthana can reborn one of your Non-Effect monsters that was destroyed by battle or card effect then if successful, destroy one monster your opponent controls, and Adhara can recycle one of your banished Tenyi monsters back to your hand. This core allows us to maintain a powerful board presence with a few negates and have some play on the crack back if our board does get broken. For the rest of the Monsters, we play two <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and a <a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> to stop our opponent from gaining a strong a field presence. Two <a data-name=""Mimicking Man-Eater Bug"">Mimicking Man-Eater Bug</a> that when face down, still allows you to summon Tenyi monsters, and when flipped face-up will have the effect to target a monster your opponent controls, destroy it, and then gain that monster's original attack and type. Man-Eater also has the bonus of not being able to be destroyed by monsters with the type you just acquired. In addition, we also run two <a data-name=""Battle Faders"">Battle Faders</a> to prevent the opponent from attacking directly. Finally, to round out the monsters, we have two <a data-name=""Droll"">Droll</a> and one <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> as the hand traps. For the spells, we have: one <a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a> to take control of an opponents monster, two <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> to clear the board, two <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> to add a Wyrm to hand and fill the grave with a Tenyi, a <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> for the field spell, a <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> to fill your grave with a Tenyi, not in hand, a <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to recycle a monster and gain an advantage, and finally one <a data-name=""Flawless Protection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Protection of the Tenyi</a> to protect our Non-Effect monsters and once per turn draw two if your opponents has special summoned an effect monster. For the Traps, we are running: two <a data-name=""Swordsoul Blackout"">Swordsoul Blackout</a> to destroy two cards on our opponent's field, three <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> to skip our opponent's battle phase, and two <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>. This card is an Omni-negate that can trigger as long as you control a Non-Effect monster and if destroyed by your opponent card effect allows you to summon a Non-Effect monster from the Extra Deck negating its summoning conditions. In the Extra Deck, we have three <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> and one <a data-name=""Lanphorhynchus"">Lanphorhynchus</a>, easy link climbing fodder for your main deck Tenyi's. One <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> to trade monsters. Two <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> to bring back a Wyrm from the grave. One <a data-name=""Ra'Ten"">Ra'Ten</a> and one <a data-name=""Sahasrara"">Sahasrara</a> to help flood the field. Two Berserker of the Tenyi to act as a Non-Effect beat stick. One <a data-name=""Yazi"">Yazi</a> and One <a data-name=""Catastor"">Catastor</a> for the synchros, one <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> for spell and trap removal, and one <a data-name=""Master of Oz"">Master of Oz</a> which is a High attack normal monster that can be bolstered by the Tenyi's effects. The side is pretty self-explanatory, <a data-name=""Ash Blosssom"">Ash Blosssom</a>, <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a>, and Veiler are all great hand traps. <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> can be used with Tornado Dragon to lock your opponent out of the extra deck, <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> can be summoned with one Tenyi and locks special summoning, two <a data-name=""Dragon Cycle"">Dragon Cycle</a> for searching and summoning, and an extra Flawless Perfection if you really need to draw it, There's no perfect end board for this deck it's built to adapt and change with games and prevent your opponent from gaining an advantage. For the most part, you want to focus on link climbing and special summoning with your main deck Tenyi's, setting up a board that has a few Non-Effect monsters like Monk or Berserker on board and a few Tenyi's in the grave. You'll also want to rely on the disruption this deck provides by using the traps, Man-Eater Bugs, and Droll's to stop your opponent from comboing off. Some of the funny techs this deck is able to provide is to use Blackout on your Non-Effect monster, pop two cards your opponent control, use Shthana to bring back your Non-Effect, and pop a monster on your opponent's side, essentially taking three off your opponent's field. You can set Mimicking Man-Eater Bug on your field, Summon Lava Golem to your opponents, pass turn your opponent takes 1000, then if attacked Man-Eater Bug can flip face-up, gain the attack of the Lava Golem and destroy it clearing your opponents 3000 monster. Utilizing the side deck you can set Scythe, special summoning one level four Tenyi and normal summon another level four, overlay for Tornado Dragon, then on your opponent's turn use the effect to detach one, pop the Scythe, and lock your opponent out of their extra deck for the turn. If your opponent is playing a deck with heavy back-row removal you can set Fists, bait out a destruction effect, then when destroyed special summon Master of Oz which, as a Normal beat-stick, is still protected by Tenyi effects.

Easy Access to the cards you need in order to give your opponent a hard time if they are playing a deck that relies heavily on the extra deck. The main deck is set up for going first with a side deck built solely for going second. Cards that can easily be swapped out in general is the ""Floowandereeze &amp; the scary sea"" and ""Artifact Dagda"" as they are just place holders. for siding going second I typically side out the ""Harpie's Feather Storm"" set for ""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"" if I know that I have targets for their key Extra Deck Cards, and you can always side out ""Dimension Shifter"" going into game 2 or 3 depending on the Die roll if you're worried about opening it. Going forward I will be replacing ""Artifact Dagda"" once I figure out what would be a better target for ""Ghost reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"". Lastly I would like to maybe include ""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"" as a possibility for a side card as it has descent effects and is an additional target for ""Floowandereze Eglen"" although right now it's not the best choice."

If I don't want to go into the big fusions immediately I rely of the despia aspect. The archetype has some nice floating effects (Beast <strong>-&gt;</strong> Traps, Mist <strong>-&gt;</strong> Monsters &amp; Arsenal <strong>-&gt;</strong> Spells). I would have ran 3 of all the level &amp; lower Myutants but it felt too much. ""Myutant Mutant"" &amp; Lab are both great extenders and Lab is a nice reload in case I draw one of the boss monsters. They're just so dang fun, we need more support!</li>  	<li> <strong>Despia</strong>: Like I said, no clue how to build with Albaz lol I was considering using Dogmatika for this but since it's mostly a fusion heavy deck I didn't want to be locked out of the extra deck. The other part of the strategy is to utilize Tragedy and Opening for the main combo (Opening -&gt; send Tragedy -&gt; SS Aluber -&gt; chain both effects -&gt; profit) I also wasn't quite sure what the extra deck should look like so I just set up the extra deck with 2 of most of the fusions and do all the fusion shenanigans. Incredible Ecclesia is solid enough as a 1 of, especially since it's ~$80 GEEZ!</li>  	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: The deck is very weak to negations and handtraps, the Myutants can play around Ash pretty well but things like Effect Veiler, Droll, and others can hit this deck hard. It also has a hard time with backrow removal so it makes it a little hard in that regard too. My side deck is for those occasions when the hand traps are too much of a problem and for some different tech options. Like Tragedy discarded for Twin Twisters and Traptrick to get a Myutant Cry faster.</li>  	<li><strong>Notes</strong>: If you banish Tragedy for the cost of the Myutants it won't work :/ Had to learn that the hard way when I got judge ruled 3 times lol. I did consider running E. Teleport but Im just not sure what to take out ya know? Lastly Thank you again for reading and i look forward to reading any advise! :)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

Not gonna lie, this deck is actually much better than I thought it would be. If you want to put 2 Mechaba and a","I like Mechaba so much, I decided ""Why not put up a Mechaba with a Mechaba?"" The idea is pretty simple - Between Aleister and the Hex-Seals there are a lot of copies of ""Aleister"" to fuse with. Power Bond can serve as a back-up for Invocation to make Mechaba, usually making Mechaba #1. Herz is the ideal companion here - Herz can add a Cyber Dragon to your hand from your deck when it goes to the GY to set up Fusion plays, but it gets better from there. Pitch it with Mechaba, and you can use its effect to pick itself back up, meaning one copy fuels a single Mechaba for multiple turns. Additionally, if Therion ""King"" Regulus is equipped with Herz, when Regulus sends itself to the GY you can search (or pick back up) a Cyber Dragon. So this deck always has fuel for Mechaba. That's literally the deck, set up 3 Negates, then later kill with Chimeratechs, or use Chimeratechs to break boards and then set up negates if you can't OTK. You probably can. I believe in you! Or just attack with Cyber Dragon!"

So, naturally, there comes a time when you look at a pile of purple cards and ask yourself: ""how many of these can I cram into a deck and still be playable?"" and turns out the answer is: ""around five or six"".  Your best cards are Branded Fusion and Rainoheart since are one card starters. Thankfully, both are accessible by Emergency Teleport-like effects (Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment). This frees the space for your normal summon so I decided to play the second best fusion normal summon (don't worry, He will make a cameo on this list anyway) without a tutor from deck spell card: Dinomorphia Therizia which searches the frankly absurd Dinomorphia Frenzy to go into Rexterm for a big floodgate. The funny thing is... There's still space for another floodgate in the form of Shaddoll Winda. SInce Branded Fusion is one of the most busted cards in recent memory, you can easily make her by sending Squamata or Beast when fusing Lubellion. If two floodgates aren't enough for you, oh boy, I have great news! By just adding one brick in the form of the dark Hex Sealed monster, you can also make Invoked Caliga if you dump it with Branded Fusion (which at this point is the atlas that carries half the format -which it says a lot considering it's also a format with full power Adventurer engine-). Honestly, at this point I was losing my mind by seriously considering playing Fusion Destiny since it's not only searchable by Alba-Lenatus, but you can also play Destiny Hero Malicious instead of Dasher to have an extra body on the field which can also be recycled by your Tearalaments and play it as if it wasn't semi-limited. Sadly I didn't do it in the end since the way this version of the deck works, you get locked into fusions most of the time so you couldn't really take advantage of this interaction. That being said, I hope someone finds a way to take full advantage of it.  DISCLAIMER: You should really be looking for a Tearalaments/Branded list, since it's the real best version of the deck."

The idea behind the deck, initially, was to take advantage of the various interactions between Urgent Schedule, Machina Citadel, and Scrap Recycler (with the Wyvern). Looking at Regulus, I immediately liked it in the deck. Often this deck put up a Super Dora + Apollousa going first, but I love the idea of adding an easy maindeck omni, especially since Citadel + Regulus is a low-end board I can get behind.  So, it's an Urgent Schedule deck. The idea behind this card is simple - if you're going second, this card is going to make you Scrap Wyvern to pop cards, it is going to give you material for Unicorn, Accesscode (and Phoenix) to break board, and when you pop the Scrap Recycler with the Wyvern, it'll revive big daddy Citadel to add a 10 to your board, or just put up a board wipe. However, if you're going first, this card can add a level 10 Machine to your hand if you pop it with Wyvern, so this will help extend your combos. Also, this card can be a mini ""scapegoat"" that can save your bacon in a situation where you set it. 3 of it and the Recycler are mandatory. I'm on Raptor as my Wyvern brick, because it will get the second Recycler trigger going, but is also a back-up starter, albeit a much worse one.  I'm a big fan of the Irradiator/Megaform/Redeployment trick, so I'm running it here. Redeployment is an insane card, and helping set up my GY while guaranteeing a Citadel is super sweet.  I'm on all 7 legal copies of Regulus. There are a few reasons for this - firstly, redundant copies are good food for Fortress, but also work just with themselves to get you extra negation, and can even be played in multiple ways, so I'm cool on running multiple Regulus. Also the field spell is nuts. Additionally, the Field spell can be popped by Wyvern, so it does double duty. But the main reason is that I think this deck barely has legs without Regulus, and I wanted to really maximize my chances of seeing Regulus. This card is sort of like a Gryphon Rider for the deck defensively, and is busted in multiples, so I really wanted to max out and run all 7.  This deck is hurt by the Auroradon hit, but because your bread-and-butter was Wyvern, not Halq, it isn't a big deal. It does mean the end of the easy 3 Omni + Citadel setups, but Apollo + Citadel + Regulus should be fine (and occasionally you might sneak in a Super Dora, if you're feeling frisky, over the Citadel). Also, remember that Urgent Schedule prevents you from attacking with non Machine monsters - Regulus and Citadel are still live, and ""Choo choo!"" hitting them with a train is still on the table, but Accesscode is just to shred their board - otherwise build Apollo."

Instead, the Main Deck monsters can activate an effect that can fuse monsters together by shuffling them from the hand, field or GY back into the deck, making them very recursive. Shove the best deck right now into the archetype and you have a pretty solid meta list centered around fusion summoning.  For the decklist, we have a Tearalaments package of 2x Shaylen, 3x Reinoheart, 2x Haufenis, 2x Meirrow, 3x Ruined Realm(and 1x Terraforming and 1x Metaverse for it), 3x Crime, 3x Kaleido-Heart, and 2x Kitkalos, we have a Branded package of 1x Dramaturge, 1x Ad Libitum, 2x Albion the Shrouded, 3x Aluber, 2x Albaz, 2x Tragedy, 3x Lost, 3x Fusion, 3x Red, 3x Opening, 1x Chimera, 1x Mirrorjade, 3x Lubellion, 1x Quaeritis, 2x Albion the Branded, and 1x Masquerade, for the rest of the Main Deck, we have  my preferred lineup of Handtraps, 2x Nibiru, 3x Ash Blossom, 2x Ghost Belle, 3x Maxx C, and 2x Veiler, 3x Galaxy Cyclone, 3x Grass, 2x Called By, for the rest of the Extra Deck, we have 1x Underworld Goddess."

However the twist this time might be the most delirious attempt to make, to make any bizarre Eldlich variant into a niche experience. By incorporating the golden lord with the protectors of <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a>, you become God of the GY and not just your GY. All of this while building the boards you usually do with the both of them separately, and returning the favor of giving your opponent temporary floodgates.  &nbsp;  So where to begin? Well there is the usual Eldlich package, which contains cards such as <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> and <a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlett Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlett Sanguine</a> to either recover the Golden Lord from the GY or add him to the hand from the Deck. Next comes his minions; however the only two ""playable"" pieces in his arsenal are <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land </a>and <a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a>. Simply put it that while there it isn't too much for him to offer when played alone; the way I assumed (from the last two years of seeing him being played) he was always meant to be played was as a hybrid piece that at least tries to have synergy with Eldlich. That being said the Gravekeeper archetype (a counter to Eldlich) coincidentally works well with Eldlich, regardless of Necrovalley's GY negation somewhat being a problem for the deck.  &nbsp;  Now the answers on how in the world does <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> get the pass the one field spell that stops it from doing what it does pass. For starters there is one monster in the Gravekeeper parable know to treat itself as the same infamous while on the field while on the field; but the catch is that it doesn't give off the GY negation effect the original field spell does (known truly as <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Priestess"">Gravekeeper's Priestess</a>). As a result of having both <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Priestess"">Gravekeeper's Priestess</a> and <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> in my deck, I can do the usual combo setup I can attend to do, and then once done (if I can) go into <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> pass for my opponents turn. This is useful because with the returning prevalence of GY effects (and the fact that the Branded Dragons use monsters in the GY as extensions for fusion summons), this puts a halt on any advance if they rely on their GY for any plays whatsoever. Then if you want to get rid of the said Necrovalley that is on the field at the beginning of your turn (regardless if you have a priestess or not), just scoop it with your <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>.  &nbsp;  As for your Extra deck, it is important to note that not all of them are gonna be used to the fullest extent, and sometimes would be fodder for <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>. However in this case, just about all the cards in the Extra deck did not go untouched through out all my matches. This is because I tried to make sure to find the ones best suited for situations where I could make use of them to the best I can. The card <a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Traptrix Rafflesia</a> is a new addition in any of my decks, as it can detach one material to copy one ""Trap-Hole"" trap card milled to the GY by it's effect. Next comes the centerpiece of the Gravekeeper archetype, <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist"">Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist </a>(a card that can't be destroyed by card effects if Necrovalley is on the field; but can search a Gravekeeper or Necrovalley card at the end of your turn). Then comes the additions of both <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustorous"">Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustorous</a> and <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a>; and if you played in the format long enough (or played Yu-Gi-Oh the past couple years), you would know what both of them would do and while I added in the deck for a different reasons that each other, both have significant impacts that worked out to getting into either <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of Master Magicians</a> or into <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> without hesitation.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This, in a Monarch engine, allows you to continuously make plays and gain more options as to what you wish to play - with cards such as Monarchs Stormforth or Ehther the Heavenly Monarch making full use of tributing. This, in tangent with Slifer and Soul Crossing, incites major card advantage while getting rid of opponent's monsters. Slifer also acts as a disruption against some decks and incompotent foes who can't read, as no one ever seems to realise Slifer has a really powerful last effect - reducing any opponent's monster summoned in ATK position's attack by 2000 and destroying it if it becomes 0 ATK because of this. But no matter how I put it, its still a glorified control deck that tries to limit opponent's plays and summons. Still extremely fun tributing your opponent's monsters to summon Slifer and beat them up with it. </span>  For just a look at what to do when you stare at me ranting on, just look at the boldened text to learn of the main premise.  <span><strong>Squad Goals:</strong></span>  <span>Your main goal in the beginning is to get out or search for our starter, Edea the Heavenly Squire, who will then be summoned (preferably SS'd so you can tribute summon twice) and activate its effect to summon Eidos the Underworld Squire. Eidos allows for another tribute summon upon him entering the field this turn.</span>  <span> Before tributing these two into a Monarch from hand, you should first try and get Pantheism of the Monarchs in the banished zone by using its effect to search for either disruption or continuation. Alternatively, if Pantheism has already been used or is not accessible, The Prime Monarch is a preferable substitute as it can banish a useful card in your GY.</span>  <span>After a Monarchs spell/trap is in the banished zone that you want, you can use: The Monarchs Stormforth (if an opponent has a monster), Return of the Monarchs or Precious Cards from Beyond to gain advantage. Preferably, use as many as possible but be cautious in decking out with Precious Cards from Beyond.</span>  <span> <strong>Tributing into a Monarch now allows you to use their effect which can be chained with Edea in order to stop it from being negated.</strong> <span>Caius is an extremely powerful asset against most decks as targetting and banishing a Dark Monster on the field makes your opponent have to banish every single copy of it no matter where it is, effectively shutting down a lot of decks that are reliant on said monster - an example is Eldlich, go make them cry. You do not specifically have to target a Dark Monster, you can target any card, but it is advised to do so if they don't benefit from it. He (she?) can also instead banish TWO cards if you tributed a dark monster (Eidos) so it can have the option of shutting down more of the opponent's plays. Furthermore, the card even does 1000 LP burn when you target and successfully banish - adding that small bit of burn that can end up winning games. </span></span><span>Ehther can be a massive impact as it gets another beatstick out on the field (preferably a second Ehther) which is returned to the hand during the EP, this effect is even better due to it sending two monarch cards - either thinning the deck out of now useless cards or setting up for a Pantheism banish effect / Prime Monarch summon. Ehther is also interaction as, by banishing a Monarch spell/trap in GY, you can tribute summon it on your opponent's turn - combo this with The Monarchs Stormforth to be able to tribute an opponent's monster for free and possibly interrupt them. Erebus is a powerful threat under certain circumstances due to its effect of shuffling an opponent's card (from field, graveyard or randomly from hand) with the same ""send two"" as Ehther, but the card really shines in the graveyard in which it allows for recycling at the cost of a Monarch spell/trap in hand which can further create more plays. Erebus is also needed for Return of the Monarchs, in which you can either search for it or search with it depending on which you summoned.</span>  If there is no advantage in using more than one tribute, you can set up Domain before the tribute summon to reduce the level of the Monarch in hand to LVL 6, meaning it only requires one tribute to be summoned. You can also tribute summon a Monarch using just one tribute summoned monster if neccessary - but it is unrecommended to do so as you're wasting potential growth in your board.  Eidos' GY effect can also be activated to SS Edea from the graveyard. If you know you have an extra Edea you can summon and make plays with, then you can not bother with saving it and can just use it straight up for a tribute material for even more advantage - but otherwise it would be advised to save it for your next turn so Edea's summoning effect can be used.  Finally, you can just set your traps or quick-plays to have interaction. Soul Crossing is one example as you can tribute three of your opponent's monsters to get out Slifer, which both the tribute and Slifer itself can greatly hinder their turn. Also, highly suggested you play Domain somewhere in your turn so that the opponent has to slay the tribute summoned cards before being able to access the Extra Deck.  <span><strong><span>Caution:</span></strong></span>  Using Soul Crossing limits you to only one more activation that is not Slifer's effects or any Divine-Beasts so try and use it towards the end of your turn to just not care about this limitation.  Monarchs Stormforth and, I believe, Soul Crossing don't allow for the tributing of non-affected monsters as the spell itself would be affecting it. This means that you can still tribute a monster that is unaffected by everything but spells, yet some cards are thus difficult to get over without Slifer beatstick.  Anchamoufrite is a free draw when put in the pendulumn scale and can be SS'd from the extra for the harsh price of nothing.  Caius is not optional, so if you tribute summon it and the opponent has no cards to target then say your goodbyes to one of your own cards.  Don't deck out with Precious Cards from Beyond, its effect isn't optional BUT using Soul Crossing means that only one can activate - use that and the fact you can use the Monarch's effect (to only need to tribute one tribute summoned monster) or Domain to lower its LVL to 6 so as to not fulfill the ""two tributes"" part as you will.  Don't die of laughter when you kill yourself with Precious Cards from Beyond or when you direct attack with Slifer for 12000 LP, haha.  Most importantly, good luck and draw the out."

The <em>Side Deck</em> probably has room for improvements, the most important card is King Tiger Wanghu that could turn out to be incredibly useful. <h4>Variations:</h4> <em>More: </em>- <a data-name=""Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"">Gorz the Emissary of Darkness</a> (just add one, can save from some last second disaster) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> (we could run x1/2 more in the <em>Main Deck</em> or in the <em>Side Deck</em>, for the moment I feel like we have enough removals or maybe it's too much already) - <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> (super strong card, it's not limited in this format so I'm tempted to run more of those) - <a data-name=""Smashing Ground"">Smashing Ground</a> (super strong card, it's not limited in this format so I'm tempted to run more of those) - <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> (could be better to use directly 2 in the <em>Main Deck</em>, but depends on how frequently it's possible to encounter mass removals) - <a data-name=""Legendary Jujitsu Master"">Legendary Jujitsu Master</a> (is a very powerful card, maybe run it in <em>Main Deck</em> instead of the Beast King Barbaros or simply as an addition)  <em>Less:</em> - <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> (I have lots of doubts about this card, it's very strong, but I don't know if increase it or move it to the <em>Side Deck</em>, maybe it's redundant) - <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> (Having x2 in <em>Main Deck</em> and x1 in <em>Side Deck</em> could be too much, might consider removing x1 copy from one of the two decks) - <a data-name=""Royal Oppression"">Royal Oppression</a> (Depends on the opponents, but could be useful to move x1 copy from <em>Main Deck</em> to <em>Side Deck</em>) <h4>Useful cards:</h4> - <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven </a>- <a data-name=""Banisher of the Light"">Banisher of the Light</a> - <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> - <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - <a data-name=""D.D. Assailant"">D.D. Assailant</a> - <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> - <a data-name=""Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer"">Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer</a> - <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> - T<a data-name=""rap Dustshot"">rap Dustshot</a> - <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> - <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>  <em>Can't wait to complete this deck and play some old-style games!

This is my old <strong>Antimeta from 2012</strong> (respects the <a>March 2012 banlist</a>) which was always in my backpack at the time. A similar version could be nowadays played in <em>Edison</em> <em>Format</em> (<a>March 2010 banlis</a>t) with few modifications. In fact, I continued updating my deck until I kept playing the game regularly, which means somewhere in Summer 2012 (i.e. a couple of banlists ahead of Edison). I'd like to create an Edison version of this deck in the future.  The <strong>core idea</strong> of the deck is to summon some good troublemakers as <em><a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a></em> and/or <em><a data-name=""Thunder King Rai-Oh"">Thunder King Rai-Oh</a></em> whose effects will start blocking the opponent's moves. You want to do everything you can to defend the one which stops your opponent as much as possible and you have plenty of choices to do so.  The <em><a data-name=""Doomcaliber Knight"">Doomcaliber Knight</a></em> is quite predictable, but a nice attacking monster which also creates some troubles. Also, the <em><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a></em> is useful to push back the Synchros from where they come from. The <em><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></em> is for emergencies and the <em><a data-name=""Banisher of the Radiance"">Banisher of the Radiance</a></em> and the <em><a data-name=""King Tiger Wanghu"">King Tiger Wanghu</a></em> are good if the opponent uses the graveyard (which is quite common) or small monsters respectively.  Cards will go away very quickly from your hand and field since you will activate lots of traps and spells, that's why we have the <em><a data-name=""Morphing Jar"">Morphing Jar</a> </em>for a quick reload (might as well disrupt the opponent's plans) and the <em><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a></em> doen no interfere with our plans since we do not special summon a lot.

One of the decks which were always in my backpack was this Exodia deck. This version that I decided to upload here was the last one I owned at the moment I stopped playing the game (the banlist of reference is the one of <a>September 2012</a>). I think it's one of the most fun and competitive versions of this deck (without going into the FTK/OTK ones - which are not fun imho) and it's also quite unique.  It is only the final evolutionary step of a deck which saw a ton of modifications over those years, therefore since these days I was rethinking about old memories, I saved this decklist to not forget it. I also made a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-edison/"">version to play in Edison</a>, therefore adapting it to an earlier banlist (<a>March 2010</a>), which also reflects one of the earliest versions (much more defensive, with a variation using <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> and <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a>) of this deck. Last but not least, I also made a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-2022/"">2022 version of the deck</a> to play the modern game (probably not my cup of tea, but it was fun to think about it and I will test it asap).  <span><em>I sincerely hope to bring back some sweet memories to you as well, I'd love to see your old decks from that era and I invite you to like and comment on all my decks if you wish!</em></span>"

This deck is meant to take full advantage of myutants banishing mechanic, by permently whittling down your opponets cars through ""<strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>"", ""<strong>Myutant Mist</strong>"", ""<strong>Myutant Arsenal</strong>"" and<strong> ""Necroface</strong>"". While controling your opponents moves with cards like ""<strong>Summon Limit</strong>"" and ""<strong>Myutant Clash</strong>"". Then ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" is a nice little tech that will allow you to gain life with each banished card which pretty much ammounts to every card you use, allowing you to have sustainabilty if they were to ever get through your board.</p><p>A good start is if you open with ""<strong>Myutant M-05/Mytant ST-46</strong>"" and ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"". if you open with ""<strong>Myutant M-05</strong>"" you summon it search for ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" then use ""<strong>Myutant M-05</strong>"" Secound effect to banish ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" immediatly milling 5 cards from both of your decks and Summoning Myutant Beast from deck. If you open with ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" Then you want to summon it instead search for ""<strong>Myutant EVO Lab</strong>"", then use ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" Secound effect to banish ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" summoning ""<strong>Myutnat&nbsp; Beast</strong>"". if you are lucky on the Mill and banish ""Myutant M-05"" you can then use ""<strong>Myutant EVO Lab</strong>"" to special summon it from the Banish zone. which you would use to then search ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>""&nbsp; and then use it secound effect to banish a trap to summon ""<strong>Myutant Arsenal</strong>"" from deck if able to.</p><p>A note to add is that the ""<strong>Necroface</strong>""&nbsp; proc will allow you to see what cards your opponent has in their deck giving you an hint to what they are playing and allowing you to make a more effective strategy.</p><p><br />Knowing that their are better options to play here is a guide if you want to make the deck a bit better.</p><p>So just in case i will give you a bit of a better deck list. for monster cards ""<strong>Myutant Gb-88</strong>"" and ""<strong>Myutant Mist</strong>"" are effects are very specific and when used can easily turn the game arround but just as easily can become brick in your deck. For these cards you can just replace them with any hand trap ""<strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Psyframe Gamma</strong>,<strong> Max C</strong> and <strong>Nibiru""</strong> would be the most effective. You could also add more <strong>Nemese</strong> cards for how they take advantage of myutants banishing mechanic and would allow you to add link plays to the deck.</p><p>For Spell ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" and ""<strong>Psychic path</strong>"" are not needed and can be taken out entierly, but their main purpose in the deck is to take advantage of the bainishing mechanic. due to myutants always banishing both you and you're cards, ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" will allow for easy life and can keep you in the game for a bit longer. ""<strong>Psychic path</strong>"" will allow you to add 2 of you're myutant starters back to hand from the banished zone which can be incredibly powerfull. but overall both of these cards can end up bricking you if drawn at the wrong time.</p><p>""<strong>Pot of Desires</strong>"" and ""<strong>Pot of Extravagence</strong>"" can easily be switched between each other with absolutly no issue. Both of these cards can be gimmicked with ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"", If you are in an advantagous position you can use ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" to shuffle back every banished cards but at the cost of your normal summon. This works better with ""<strong>Pot of Desires</strong>"" as the only down side that comes from it is the bannished. ""<strong>Pot of Extravagence</strong>"" on the other hand will stop you from using ""<strong>Myutant Evo Labs</strong>"" secound effect of allowing you to place one myutant card on the bottom of your deck and draw 1 but that is easily a price worth sacerficing.</p><p>Traps you have ""<strong>Myutant clash</strong>"". This card will allow you to target negate one monster card on the field but it require you to have a myutant monster in the graveyard to do this. its secound effect being allowing you to draw one for when a level-8 myutant destroys a monster by battle. This effect can be good but overall it can be replaced with Imperm which has overall just has better effect.

Other cards such as Stardust Dragon, and Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend are featured as well. Harmonizing Magician is the center piece of the Main Deck due to her ability to Special Summon from the Deck when Pendulum Summoned. Pendulum Call and Duelist Aliance can be used to setup the Pendulum Scale, and to get Harmonizing Magician into the hand.  When Pendulum Summoning isn't required to Link Summon; Beyond the Pendulum is a powerful card to Link into for her effect to add a Pendulum Monster to your hand.

Assumes you have completed the pendulum tutorial in solo mode.,"<p>Solfachord is a fun pendulum deck quite difficult to master and expensive to make, but rewarding in its own right. While I consider this the most consistent version, please consider using the suggested alternatives in the side deck if you already have them.</p><p>Inherent Weakness of Pendulum Summoning : Pendulums require 2 cards from hand to activate the scales. Without additional searches, you are left with 3 cards in hand after activating scales on your first turn. Pendulum monsters do not go to the GY, so you can't rely on GY effects. Finally, the deck must mostly consist of pendulum cards for consistency and power (lacks handtraps or traps). Typically, these weaknesses are resolved using pendulum effects. However, <strong>Solfachords don't have pendulum effects that resolve these issues</strong>.</p><p><a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> : <strong>The best card for Pendulums</strong> <br />Summon Electrumite to use its effect to add <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a> to the extra deck. Destroy a pendulum card in scale using Electrumite's effect and add Astrograph from the extra deck. Electrumite's effect draws you 1 card and Astrograph uses its effect to summon itself and add a copy of the destroyed pendulum card from the deck. With a single Electrumite you gained a free monster on field with +2 in hand. Electrumite requires two pendulum monsters to summon and you should ideally do the combo <strong>before</strong> your pend summon. So, how do we get Electrumite on field?</p><ol><li><a class=""type-pendulum-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=44179224"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/44179224.jpg"" data-card=""44179224"" data-name=""Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser"">Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser</span></a>&nbsp; : It's a free special summon from the pendulum zone if you control no monsters.</li><li>Normal Summon Starter : <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> is your main normal summon. You can send <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a> to the GY and use its effect to tribute Diviner. Diviner then special summons Cutia from the deck when tributed.</li></ol><p>Now that we have Electrumite on field, let's take a look at our Solfachord cards. <br />Even Scale Solfachords : <br />8: <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Cutia"">DoSolfachord Cutia</a> is the <strong>main starter</strong> of the deck. It can search any of your Solfachord monsters except itself when summoned. By searching Dreamia, you can make Electrumite. <br />4: <a data-name=""SolSolfachord Gracia"">SolSolfachord Gracia</a> can search any of your Solfachord spells and traps. Prioritize Harmonia or Elegance. <br />Odd Scale Solfachords : <br />7: <a data-name=""ReSolfachord Dreamia"">ReSolfachord Dreamia</a> is an extender that can special summon itself if your have a Solfachord in your pendulum zone. <br />5: <a data-name=""FaSolfachord Fancia"">FaSolfachord Fancia</a> is your alternate Solfachord normal summon. It allows you to add any Solfachord monster to your extra deck. <br />3: <a data-name=""LaSolfachord Angelia"">LaSolfachord Angelia</a> can special summon a Solfachord monster from your deck that has scales +2/-2 of a monster you tribute. For example, Angelia can tribute itself to special summon Fancia or Coolia from your deck. <br />1: <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Coolia"">DoSolfachord Coolia</a> is your main deck boss monster. In your main phase, you can target up to 2 cards and negate their effects until the end of the opponent's turn. <br />Other Solfachord cards : <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Harmonia"">Solfachord Harmonia</a> : This is an important field spell that can recover a Solfachord from your extra deck. It can also make any of your Solfachords into a 9 (high) scale. <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Elegance"">Solfachord Elegance</a> : This is the <strong>most powerful card in Solfachord</strong>. It allows you to add any Solfachord from your hand to the extra deck to set your scales. This effect cannot be negated by Ash Blossom. <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Musica"">Solfachord Musica</a> : It allows you to target and destroy a card your opponent controls.</p><p>All of the Solfachord Pendulum monsters have pendulum effects that prevent the opponent from negating or reacting to your pendulum summon. This makes the pend summon itself quite resilent. However, what's the payoff? <br /><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> : When <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> is sent to the GY, you can special summon Vortex Dragon from the extra deck. You can make the 7 rank Xyz using cards like Astrograph Sorcerer and <a data-name=""TiSolfachord Beautia"">TiSolfachord Beautia</a>. <br /><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> : For pendulums, <strong>having access to a link monster with arrows pointing to your main monster zones is important</strong>. You can easily make Selene using the Electrumite and Astrograph Sorcerer you have on field. <br /><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> : This is the best link 4 that provides plenty of arrows for a pendulum summon. If you have other alternatives, feel free to use those. <br /><a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a> : Your main deck Solfachords have fire, earth, water, wind attributes while <a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a> is a light. You can often make a 5000 ATK unaffected boss monster.</p><p>*<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> : While not a boss monster, it is vital to stop Maxx ""C"". Also, it is a level 3 tuner which allows for Halq plays or can help with synchro summoning. Other cards to consider : <strong>All of the suggested link monsters&nbsp;are great alternative options as they all have arrows pointing down. Consider using them instead if you already have them.</strong> <br /><a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> : You already have an <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> in case you want to use Diviner's effect. <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to add Ecclesia which adds Fleurdelis when special summoned. While this can make your endboard a bit stronger, note that this will prevent you from summoning from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.<a data-name=""Maxx"">&nbsp;</a></p><p><a data-name=""Maxx"">I hope this guide can help new players get into pendulum summoning using my favorite pendulum archetype, Solfachords. There aren't a lot of set plays once you have Electrumite on field, so you have to practice to set up strong fields. The deck hard bricks once every 10 duels, so keep that in mind when adding different engines like Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer to the deck. You can also run a pure, casual Solfachord deck with Solfachord Scale and more main deck Solfachords.</a></p>"

You use drytron's to search for everything while also using the cyber angel benten and Diviner of the herald to look for every card you need to summon out your lock down cards.  P.S the only problem with this deck is its inability to search spirit monsters easily. Your opponent has to have 3 spells or traps down and 3 monsters on the field to fully yatalock.

For my old list, see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/branded-tearalaments/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/branded-tearalaments/</a></span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The pseudo-starters</strong> - <span>The reason why I'm starting with these is because one, they're the starters that you'd normally wouldn't want to Normal Summon. Two, they're the starters that can Special Summon themselves anyway (conditional or not) which saves your Normal Summon. And three, they're either easy access to a Baronne De Fleur and/or hand trap baits for your True Normal Summons. They are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Visas Starfrost&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Visas Starfrost</strong></a> - <span>The Level 6 Tuner of the Deck that gives you access to <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a>. He and Tearalaments Shaylen, with a good set of mills can actually potentially lead to full combo. His effect to Special Summon himself destroys a monster as part of the effect, so it triggers all of your Tearalaments monsters and your Despian Tragedy to search.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Shaylen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Shaylen</strong></a> - <span>The other main pseudo-starter/extender for the Deck, which can Special Summon herself during the Main Phase once per turn, then allows you to mill the top 3 cards of your Deck. Her being Level 4 is relevant since she can also give you access to Baronne De Fleur.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Springans Kitt&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Springans Kitt</strong></a> -</span> She's here to mainly search Branded Lost upon getting Normal or Special Summoned, also to recover any of your banished ""Branded"" Spells/Traps, mainly <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a>. Also, you'd much rather want to see her in your opening hand than Fallen of Albaz, which I've cut down to 1 for this reason.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Meiru&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Meiru</strong></a> - <span>She's the other Normal Summon for Tearalaments, but in this list she's only a one of for the purposes of Fusion climbing to <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>• <strong>The True Normal Summon starters</strong> - <span>The reason these two are called ""True Normal Summon starters"" is because first of all, you most definitely do not want to start off your combo with them most of the time and second, as much as possible, these two are the ones that you'd want to Normal Summon for the following reason(s):</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aluber the Jester of Despia&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aluber the Jester of Despia</strong></a> - <span>He's usually gonna be your <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> target, but unlike the pseudo-starters, you'd actually want to Normal Summon him over them. Also this time, you're not gonna be focusing too much on the <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> search to set up for <a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>, but instead we're almost always going to search for the true star of this list, <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> for one simple reason: <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a> is a Level 9 Fusion Monster that it can bring back from the GY..</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Tearalaments Reinoheart"">Tearalaments Reinoheart</a></strong> - <span>Him being at 3 have two main reasons: First, is that it's important that we always have access to his name since he's a vital piece to summoning <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a> and secondly, his effect to Special Summon himself, unlike Aluber, also triggers his effect to send another ""Tearalaments"" monster to the GY, except a copy of himself. Him getting banished by his own effect isn't actually a detriment since the Branded engine has an excellent grind game and resource recycling when Fusion Summoning because of <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Spells/Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Lost"">Branded Lost</a></strong> - <span>The reason why I'm playing more of this is because this list has a LOT of effects that Fusion Summon, and you want them to resolve as much as possible. Without it, this list would be significantly weaker and more vulnerable to <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Tearalaments Crime"">Tearalaments Crime</a></strong> - <span>It's one of your couple of ways of recovering your banished ""Tearalaments"" monsters, mainly <a data-name=""Tearalaments Reinoheart"">Tearalaments Reinoheart</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span>  <span>Well, it's not really that different to my old Branded Tearalaments list, only did a couple few adjustments but then, that's what testing is for. Also, the fact that Baronne De Fleur can recycle herself to bring out an outed <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> in your GY is just too spicy for me to pass up on. (Also, this one's a bit short because at the time that I was writing this guide, I have a migraine/headache so, yeah.) This was a fun list to test because its crucial weakness is also one of its strengths, the fact that it's heavily reliant on good mills off the top of your Deck to pop off, which makes it also harder to telegraph unless you play the Deck yourself as well. I cannot wait for Tearalaments to get their own dedicated archetypal Fusion Spell. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments, which I think is better so that I could deal with more specific concerns if any rather than just generalizing my answers, and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

I suggest you only run Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring since you'll mainly wanna go first with this one. The deck runs two combos depending on whether or not you have Aleister the Invoker with another fusion spell. This build misses 2 important cards: Accesscode Talker and Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden. Link Artemis with Aleister, then fusion summon Invoked Mechaba using Invocation. Accesscode Talker is for easy OTK.  https://youtu.be/nILX-zerEA0"
