I'm still working on tweaking this, especially filling out the Extra Deck.  The Side deck is mostly just cards I wanted to put in, but didn't have room for, so if, for some reason, you decide to blindly take this deck to a tournament, you'll have to figure out a good one for yourself."

More than 90% chance to draw it with all draw power and those cards.</li>  	<li>To activate Mystic Mind without any opponent's monster negates use Lava Golem or Kaiju. I didn't use Sphere Mode here because the fact is that I have better results with these two monsters.</li>  	<li>To protect Mystic Mind, use Goddess Skuld's Oracle. Goddess can be use to reorder your opponent's cards in order to never draw an out</li>  	<li>Use Summon Limit and There can be only one to ***** the combo decks / unbreakable boards.</li>  	<li>Draw, draw and draw again.

I'm not a furry but I like the Fairy Tail archetype, so to make up for their flaws I decided to make them more of a control deck with village and such, and Invoked to turbo out Mechaba for negates since they're all light. Using Village and them all, they can control the game fairly well and be adorable as they do it. There's also a few OCG cards in this though so, note that. Credit to this deck for the turn lock. https://ygoprodeck.com/bamboo-sword-terminal-lock-down/ <span>Deck Guide</span>  3x Sleeper- Sleeper helps to make up for the slowness of the Fairy Tails, special summoning another from the hand. The problem is that it's a flip effect, so it's still slow. She's too cute to leave out though. In case your opponent manages to bypass your Village, you always have Sleeper there as backup to overwrite their spells into recycling Sleeper. 3x Rockha- Rockha is a simple card that manages to get us more resources, although it's up to the opponent what we get, which is fairly annoying and was sorta unnecesary on the part of Konami, but whatever. Rockha also dips when attacked, which is, sorta useless. 3x Rella- Rella gives protection to your more important monsters from spell targeting, which is minor, but still fairly helpful in some situations. And at the cost of discarding a spell, Rella equips a equip spell to herself from anywhere, specifically Bamboo Sword in this case, for the turn skip combo. While it's bounced back at the end of the turn, it still means we can recycle the turn skip. 3x Luna- Luna searches all the Fairy Tails on summon, including herself, as they all have 1850 attack (fun fact: she has great synergy with the Charmers as well due to this). Luna also can bounce herself back to the hand to bounce an opponent's monster to the hand, making her an invaluable piece of spot removal due to how weak the monsters are in this deck. 3x Aleister- Aleister is a key part of the Invoked engine. On summon, he searches out Invocation, allowing you to quickly turbo into Mechaba or anything else you need.  He also can discard himeslf to give a boost of 1000 attack to one of your fusions, which is very helpful for beating over problem monsters, as it gets out the main target for Invocation, Mechaba, to 35k attack, which is above average and means he can beat over most things. 3x Ash- Ash is another great control card and a staple in nearly any modern deck, as it can negate a search during either player's turn. This means that you can cripple combos and, when timed well, fully intterupt them and stop them from happening all together, which is fantastic. And no Jobe, it's not getting limited. 3x Fairy Tail- Fairy Tail helps with field swarming, which is something Fairy Tails normally struggle with, as it allows you to normal summon a spellcaster with 1850 attack in addition to your normal summon. It also mitigates damage, as the first damage you would take with one of your 1850 spellcasters, you do not, which is also great due to the low attack stats of the Fairy Tails. (Fun fact: This card also has great synergy with Charmers, due to the Charmers being spellcasters with 1850 attack.) 3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the key pieces of the Invoked engine. It allows you to summon using your monsters on your hand/field/grave, and the opponent's grave, which is great. The main target for this is Mechaba, as the Fairy Tails are all lights and that means you can quickly turbo into Mechaba on turn 1 to set up an easy negate. Although, depending on the match up you can also go into more stuff like Purgatrio to punish a swarm deck. 3x Secret Village- Secret Village is one of the deck's key cards. A majority of the deck is spellcasters, aside from Ashblossom, which means you can easily normal summon out a Fairy Tail and activate Secret Village to have the lock on turn 1. Most decks rely on spells, so not being able to have them will be crippling. And outing Secret Village without them will be insanely hard due to not having access to any spells, which makes up most spell/trap removal. 3x Knowledge- Knowledge is the deck's main draw power. At the cost of sending a Spellcaster to grave, which doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things (as you can easily send an Aleister and then banish said Aleister from grave for a fusion since Invocation reaches into grave), and then draw 2. While you stay even in card advantage, it's still a great draw. 3x Terminal World- Terminal World is another lockdown card, to basically remove the second main phase from play. A lot of decks like setting their shit in the second main phase, and a lot of decks are forced to skip the main phase due to various effects so you can force them to skip the main phase 2 as well. You can also use this in tandem with Burning Bamboo Sword and regular Bamboo Sword to fully skip the opponent's turn. 3x Burning Bamboo Sword- Burning Bamboo Sword is another one of the cards for the turn skip. Alongside Terminal World, as long as you have bamboo sword equipped to one of your monsters and Terminal World active, your opponent can't go into either of their main phases, making it so they can't do shit. Couple this with a possible Mechaba or Village lock, and it's near impossible to out. 2x Broken Bamboo Sword- The main target for Rella's effect, you'll want to get it out with Terminal and Burning to lock down the opponent and skip their turn completely. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming serves to get out Village, another layer of negates alongside the Bamboo combo. 1x Metaverse- see above <span>The extra deck </span>3x Moon Magistus- Moon Magistus is an easy link-1 that you can link away Aleister or something from to have a light on the field, just in case you don't have a Fairy Tail, somehow. 3x Ninaru- Ninaru serves to recover your lost Fairy Tails and Aleisters, making it so you can recycle them for more plays mid-to late game.  1x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.  2x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which you most likely will as you don't expend a ton of resources. . You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.  1x Magellanica- Magellanica is basically a big 3k beater that is actually a vanilla.  Magell isn’t super good but still fairly useful against earth heavy decks. I wish Aleister would’ve turned into a cat girl instead of this though.  1x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.  1x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.  1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there  21 Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it.  1x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks, and it's floodgate effect helps the control idea of this deck greatly.  <span>Playing guide <span>The main idea is to initate as many locks and negates as you can going first. Set up either the Village lock or the Bamboo/Terminal lock, so your opponent's turn is skipped and/or they can't activate any spells since you'll most likely have a Spellcaster on the field. The Bamboo/Terminal lock is fairly inconsistent, but is worth it with just how powerful it is. You can search out Broken with Rella, and then activate Burning, and then Terminal, so your opponent is fully fucked. You can also use the Invocation engine as well to get out Mechaba for an extra layer of control, to provide more negates on the opponent. After you control the gamestate and such, you just gotta slowly whittle down the opponent until you win. </span></span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Thank you, have a good day!"

Most of the time you won't be making this board btw. The deck is very cheap exept revolution dragon but you can substite him with allure of darkness.There is a single union carrier because in the side because with him you can play pendulum call and darkwurm in the deck too (you just pop the set iris from carrier with tornado dragon insted of just using his effect). I'm not using carrier because it will take too much space in the main deck and it will become pure pend mags. The rest of the extra deck is just useful cards

Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士し Enseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warriors' Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"".

Finally, 1 <strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</strong> which searches a plant and is also a potential target for <strong>Gizmek Uka</strong>.  Mainly Spells in this deck and like half of them are for access to <strong>Loci</strong>. <strong>Painful Decision</strong>,<strong> Unexpected Dai</strong>, and<strong> Where Arf Thou?</strong> are there for <strong>Loci</strong> whereas <strong>Where Arf Thou?</strong> and <strong>One for One</strong> can search other lv1's. <strong>Sunvine Cross Breed</strong> and <strong>Sunvine Shrine</strong> are searchable extenders and <strong>Shrine</strong> is also a soft once per turn which could've been a hard once per turn and have changed nothing since its activation requirement it annoying. <strong>Pot of Avarice</strong> and <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> are for draw power and gaining advantage while <strong>Avarice</strong> is also a way to recycle your link-1 monsters. Your only trap is<strong> Sunavalon Bloom</strong> which is <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> and BP reassurance i guess.  Extra Deck. 3 <strong>Sunvine Thrasher</strong> which is a beater with its effect and it can yoink a monster that it destroys by battle. 3<strong> Sunavalon Dryas</strong> which searches your<strong> Sunvine</strong> Spell/Traps. 1<strong> Sunavalon Dryades</strong> which is just a Link-2 <strong>Dryanome</strong>.<strong> Sunavalon Dryanome</strong> doesn't need to be summoned during each of your combos, but it can be played with things like the burn from <strong>Gizmek Uka</strong> or the burn from<strong> Where Arf Thou?</strong>.  1 <strong>Sunavalon Dryatrentiay</strong> which is the monster you end with and it searches a <strong>Sunavalon Spell/Trap</strong>. 1 <strong>Sunavalone Daphne</strong> for desperate recycling if you don't have <strong>Avarice</strong>. 1 <strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda</strong> whose role is linking off non-plants. 1 <strong>Aromaseraphy Jasmine</strong> as an extender. 1 <strong>Geonator Transverser</strong> for the gimmicky <strong>Uka</strong> play. 1 <strong>Strenae the Rikka Queen</strong> to make with <strong>eXceed</strong>. 1 <strong>Divine Treebeast High Peryton</strong> which is a target for <strong>Strenae</strong>.

I have been reading a lot online about different Danger Darkworld decks, as well as much Youtube research. I'm constantly updating this deck. I believe this is the best setup I've had so far. I love the amount of XYZ's that can be used for any situation and are easy to get out. And Time Thief is super easy to get out for rank 4's. I've always had it easy getting out Dragoon too.

One being they are light and dark and two, they interact with the banished zone and have 1 card which is really good at setting up said zone. This allows the deck to make great use of banished zone and use generic chaos support to make and extend plays. By adding in a small rokket engine which gives the deck access to both more link material and dark monsters to set it its graveyard, it allows S-force to make some surprisingly powerful boards and make use of some very powerful removal effects and annoying lock down effects.  &nbsp;  I will very likely update this deck when it receives later waves of support."

Then use <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> which you get from normal summoning Aleister the Invoker.

Then you make <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and you start looping and negating with him.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Play guide benefit’s downsides techs and overall strategy. </b>  &nbsp;  <b>Overall strategy and benefits</b>  <span>The basic strategy of this deck is to use the invoked engine to make their own resources and play off that and use the frog and Paleozoic to control the field. I tried to make this a slower deck than normal paleo frog which may sound weird but it's too fast when it comes to using resources. (my opinion) So by adding invoked I feel it cuts down on the resources spending. The reason I feel paleo frogs spent too many resources is they had to get more traps in their hand to stop the opponent swinging over them but if you get <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or bigger board’s it’s harder to do that.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Down side.</b>  <span>The downside to this deck is the Paleozoic side does not shine as much for the reason of not having as many traps. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Techs/and some strategy</b>  <span>So we have in the side deck <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires </a><a data-name=""Pot of Desires Pot"">Pot</a> of Avarice <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>, and last <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. Let’s get the <a data-name=""trap trick"">trap trick</a> out of the way. This is for people who like <a data-name=""trap trick"">trap trick</a> more than <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a>, so pick your favorite and take the one you do not like out. My top pick for the side deck card to replace it is <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> which is a good going second card for this deck because you most likely will never otk your opponent and negate boards can really hurt this deck. Next <a data-name=""pot of desire"">pot of desire </a>for people who like to run three swap it with what you would like and then do <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> again so you have a playset. For the first monster on the list, we got <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> which is good for keeping your opponent’s boards smaller if that becomes an issue. The second monster and last is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> which is a basic hand trap it is used if your opponent is comboing or searching too much. For the spell’s we got <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> Which I already explained. Next, we have <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> why not <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, well one reason Eldlich this deck is trap heavy and banishes their traps as cost also it’s popular. (other decks do it too so pay attention like this one). Last on the side decklist we got <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> which will help you out in a pinch see my friend <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> here needs frog monsters in the deck to work and long games with decks that are control or really fast can make you spend a lot of resources which you need to get back. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Going against different decks.</b>  <span>So let’s go with two different deck’s control and OTK EX: for control Salamangreat EX: for OTK sacred beasts. So going against sacred best’s you have to be very careful and preserve your resources so they don't power you and there is no coming back. Be patient and wait for a good moment to stun them and slowly you will take control and win. For a control deck, you want to play it slowly, wait for your moment to take control when they have no resources or you will find yourself on the other end of the table where you have no resources and you top decking. Combo decks are hard to combat because they make you spend your resources faster than you can sometimes make them.</span>  &nbsp;  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/paleofrogs-dec-2020/""><span>https://ygoprodeck.com/paleofrogs-dec-2020/</span></a><span> is the deck I was playing testing before I made this so you may see more similarities than normal because I was new to Paleozoic control. (not frog) but I do know my way around a trap heavy deck from playing chain burn. </span>"

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. Infernoble Knight, known in Japanese as Flame Holy Knight (焔えん聖せい騎き士し Enseikishi) is a series of FIRE Warrior monsters which debuted in Structure Deck R: Warriors' Strike, but became a full-fledged series of monsters with ""Rise of the Duelist"". They are a sub-series of the ""Noble Knight"" archetypes, and as such are closely related to ""Noble Arms"", in addition to the ""Roland"" archetype.

Well, that's only how it appears on first glance. The Live☆Twins provide an easy shell to give the deck a solid turn 1 play in the form of either of their Links, or a Rank 2 Xyz monster. To follow this up, various backrow is necessary to allow the deck to try and establish their loop involving both of the Evil★Twins, with cards like World Legacy Awakens, World Legacy Clash, Evil★Twin Challenge, and Mirror Force.  To fill the void in which things don't go according to plan, the deck is filled with a number of standalone monsters that can easily provide pressure until you can get the Twins going, sometimes even being able to just win on their own. Danger provides bonuses from being discarded by cards like the Knightmares, Paleozoic Dinomischus, and Live☆Twin Home, as well as being able to summon themselves from hand in a pinch. Dogmatika, on the other hand, provides solid value and beaters in the form of Dogmatika Fleurdelis and Dogmatika Theo, with Dogmatika Ecclesia being able to search both of them, with Albaz allowing you to punish DARK and high ATK decks, as well as activating the Danger effects by discarding them. After that, you get into singleton value cards like Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun serving as a beater and situational removal, Lady Debug allowing you to search monsters in a pinch, and Gussari @Ignister allowing you to punish your opponent for attacking over your Link monsters.  If you do get to looping the Evil★Twins, you're given access to rather solid wincons. The unique property of the Twins reviving the other as a quick-effect allows you to repeatedly send them to the GY via Tribute effects or Link materials to revive them and gain their on-summon effects. By doing this repeatedly, you can gain strong value off of the Knightmare monsters, which provide buffs and draws when co-linked and have a floodgate in the form of Knightmare Gryphon that can effectively stop your opponent in their tracks, while you can use cards like Zero-Day Blaster, Dark Factory of More Production and Cynet Regression to take advantage of the recursive quick revival.  In terms of value the prior cards are all very effective, but sometimes you just need a little bit more, which is why I have my own special techs to help bridge that gap. First on the list is Number 29: Mannequin Cat. Her effect allows you to punish a deck that Special Summons against you. Granted, you don't have targets for every Attribute, but you have them for the 2 most common Attributes, Light and Dark. Unfortunately, you don't always get to set up defensive plays, which is where Formud Skipper comes into play. By using his effects, you can Link for Appliancer Laundry Dragon, who can crash into an opponent's monster, destroy and burn your opponent for that monster's ATK, and then summon Gussary @Ignister from your hand due to its effect that searches it when its Linked off. Lastly, is my Rank 4 Xyz monster of choice in Light Dragon @Ignister. While Exciton may be a better card in terms of boardbreaking and comeback factory, Tornado Dragon to answer backrow, or even Castel/101 to deal with indestructible monsters, Light Dragon provides your monsters with protection from destruction via card effect, has non-targeting removal, but most importantly can be used with other Cyberse monsters to revive your Link monsters, along with the added bonus of being able to summon back Linguriboh by Tributing itself.  The side deck is much simpler to explain, as its just as it seems. A number of backrow removal Spells in their to try and make the matchup vs backrow/control decks not quite so painful along with Linkslayer, Kongreat and D.D. Crow to deal with GY focused decks or decks that send from deck/hand to GY like Rituals, Victoria and Electric Virus for the matchup vs Dragon decks like Dragonmaids, The Chaos Creator &amp; Chaos Space is try and not just lose to 1 of your Evil★Twins being banished, Chain Disappearance is specifically to banish 3 copies of Chamber Dragonmaid, Brain Control is to give a bit of solid ""removal"" vs decks that have strong maindeck monsters, and Degrade Buster is to face down high ATK decks.  And that about sums up the deck. If you can establish the Evil★Twin loops, the deck can snowball quite well. Even if it can't you can always fall back onto simple beatdown gameplay.

The ability of the Live/Evil Twins to destroy cards and draw cards is very good and while it may be stopped by handtraps, the consistency of Eldlich helps round out this control deck.  Update 1.1: Decided to go ahead and add linguriboh, bagooska, parallel eXceed. This allows for some protection from traps, and added control with parallel eXceed into Bagooska.  Update 1.2: Small change but I just added some more cards to the extra deck and changed out World Legacy Succession for Monster Reborn. There was no point of running it if I was only running 1."

Mid-Tempo control that can hold their own vs'ing the rampant popularity of Zoo Lich and Drytro,"List for the Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika for Dec 2020. Most notable change would be Artemis replacing Almiraj/Gardna, Aleister to 2, and an increase in Dogmatika lineup.  The list is only for the main deck - depending on the meta, you can main cards such as Skull Meister, and D.D Crow due to the increase in Eldlich variants running around and Drytrons. I would usually side Ice Dragon's Prison however it would be an amazing choice for the main deck too as it can easily out dragoon and an amazing trap card overall. With Infernobles and DL usage dying down, siding Nibiru might be a better meta call. With the deck being able to easily recover advantage by putting monsters on board using Invo/Schism to fusion summon and Dogma cards, siding Torrential Tribute also has been a great success for me. It can halt Virtual World/Drytron boards thats getting built. Side deck should include cards such as Artifact Lancea. Remember to take advantage of Ariel eff to banish 3 cards from GY - usually delays/stops active engines for Drytrons and Eldlich decks.  &nbsp;  If I were to change one thing, I may run 3 Construct and just 1 N'tss instead."

The second effect is to special summon spellcasters when it gets attacked, also the attacking monster's atk is halfed then. This is a good defense, because if you have a 2000-Atk-spellcaster in the graveyard, the opponent has to attack with more than 4000. When you have a spellcaster in the graveyard there are more ways to make use of it, because you normally won't get attacked to spawn the spellcasters for free. <ul>  	<li> <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> or <a data-name=""Call of The Haunted"">Call of The Haunted</a> as the fastest way</li>  	<li>You can fusion summon them from the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> can Special Summon <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a> and V<a data-name=""essel Miko Of the Ice Barrier"">essel Miko Of the Ice Barrier</a> when he gets special summoned, because they are Water-level-4-Monsters and <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> gets special summoned by it's own effect when a spellcaster gets targeted by a card-effect. <a data-name=""Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier"">Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier</a> can also be special summoned with <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> which can special summon water monsters with 1500 atk or less from the graveyard.</li> </ul> <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> – A good Support card to get more monsters on the field for Link- and synchro-summons, If you can not synchro-, link-, or fusion-summon then you normally wouldn't play <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>, so he is best to play when you already have a monster on the field, to then get at least a <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> or some other good effect-monster.  <a data-name=""Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier"">Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier</a> – It has an effect that just slows the opponent a bit down, because the battle positions can't be changed, but it also can get special summoned with an Ice Barrier Monster on the field. You also can get a level-1-Token if it is in the graveyard, that is an Ice-barrier-Card and triggers other Ice-Barrier-Effects, and which can also be used for Synchro- and Link-Summons.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> – It can be used to summon very fast Link- and Synchro-Summons. With it's effect it can either Summon another <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> or a <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a>. When you get the <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> you get a Level-4-Water-Monster from the Graveyard, also you can then Synchro-summon <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>, to synchro-summon even further with a a card from the Hand. In both cases you can also Link-summon the cards for <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>.  <a data-name=""Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a> – A level-3-tuner that can be special summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> from the deck or with <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> from the Graveyard, and which has an effect that stops the opponent from attacking if you have another Ice-Barrier-Monster, but it's easy to play around that effect, so it's a secondary option. With a level-4-Monster you get <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, but it's only good if you want to fusion- or link- summon <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> again or if you have to destroy 2 cards, because he has only 400 atk after you destroyed 2 cards, you can use him as a level-7 card for <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> to trigger the immunities, or you can link or tribute him, and fusion him later with <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> – Can special summon a level-4-Water-Card (with negated effects) from the graveyard when he gets special summoned by <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> or <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a>, It is also good to get <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>.  <a data-name=""Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a> - A Good level-1-card that triggers other Ice-Barrier effects to special summon faster, and that can also be summoned with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>.  <a data-name=""General Wayne Of The Ice Barrier"">General Wayne Of The Ice Barrier</a> – Can also get special summoned with another Ice-Barrier-monster, but only when the opponent has a monster, and it can get <a data-name=""Medallion of The Ice Barrier"">Medallion of The Ice Barrier</a> from the deck if you summon it. It is also a level-5 card to synchro summon level-7, level-8, or level-10 cards easier.  <a data-name=""Medium Of The Ice Barrier"">Medium Of The Ice Barrier</a> – It can be special summoned wen the opponent has 4 more cards then you on the field, and it is also a spellcaster that can be put into the graveyard and be special summoned later, because this is better than to pay the two tributes. If it is on the field the opponent can only activate one spell/trap-card per turn, and as a level-7 card it is good to get a level 10-synchro-summon.  <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a> – Good effect that gives other spellcasters an immunity of getting targeted, and it also can destroy a face up card by discarding a spell which is in the best case <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a> because you can get it back. It is also a level-7 Card as a synchro-material.  <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> – Level 7 and higher spellcasters can not be destroyed by card effects with this card on the field, which are <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>, <a data-name=""Medium Of The Ice Barrier"">Medium Of The Ice Barrier</a>, <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a>. If it gets destroyed you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> for fusion-summons, and if it's in the graveyard then or in the hand it can special summon itself when a spellcaster gets targeted by a card-effect, but it does not negate the effect.  <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> – It can be used to fusion summon <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and it gets special summoned by <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a>'s effect and by the effect of the <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> fusion, which improves the stall-capabilities a bit.  Extra-Deck:  Link:  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>, <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - </a><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Soldier of Chaos</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> –  there are 3 Link-2 Monsters, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> is only used to get <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, it's not cheap but the effect of <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> can be worth for only 2 effect monsters. <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a> can special summon water monsters with 1500atk or less from the graveyard, this is good to get tuners back and synchro-summon then, but it only works for water summons, you can also get <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> back from the Graveyard if you want. <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> is also great to get a level 3 or a level 2 tuner from the deck, the level 3 tuner is also an ice barrier monster for the other ice barrier effects. The effect can be used to get <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a> in the opponent's turn, but then a defense is needed, so you can play <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> or <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a> to stall.  <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> is great because he gets immunity of being targeted and destroyed when you have a level 7 or higher card, you can use <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, or the Tokens of <a data-name=""Pacifis, The Phantasm City"">Pacifis, The Phantasm City</a> and <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a>, these summon again after they are destroyed, otherwise you can use <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> as the best target, or then the other spellcasters.  <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is the best defense when you got monsters on the field or when you special summoned some monsters, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> can attack any monsters and steal them with the effect, but as a defense you only have 3000 atk so a <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a> can be more effective when you make him to a 4500-atk-monster with an immunity.  &nbsp;  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a>, <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Stardust Spark Dragon"">Stardust Spark Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> -  <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> is only used with <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, together with a special summoned <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> otherwise a token or <a data-name=""Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier"">Blizzed, Defender Of The Ice Barrier</a>, then you need to have a level-4, level-5 or level-7 card on then hand or on the field to summon the other synchro-monster's with the effect.  Coral Dragon can be summoned with Crystron Halqifibrax if you can stall one round, but it is alos worth it to just draw a card when you first summon Coral Dragon and then a level-10 or maybe level-7 or level-8 from it. Arcanite Magician can destroy 2 cards which is very good, and if you can get Predaplant Verte Anaconda in the same turn you can fusion him, otherwise it's good to link or tribute it after the effect.  Stardust Spark Dragon has a great defensive and stall effect, that protects one card from being destroyed, so you don't have to know which effect you have to negate, and you can also maybe counter more than one destroy effect.  <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> has great stall and gives you also tokens, but it is easy to destroy and has no immunities, so you want to have other cards together with it, then you can use it's effect better and special summon it from the graveyard when it gets destroyed.  &nbsp;  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a> -  <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> is an Aqua Monster like <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, and is best to stall attacks for the spellcasters because he must be targeted and can not be destroyed by battle.  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> can be summoned with the <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> that you can also get with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, and it is a level-1 monster that you can link or synchro then.  <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> can only be summoned when you have <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> in the graveyard or on the field, so you can maybe get her with <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a> or discard her earlier with <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a>, then it is very easy to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, because you normally always have a spellcaster in the graveyard that you can use as the other material, It has no immunities so it is also better in combination with other cards, but you can draw cards and you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> back when it gets destroyes as a stall-effect.  <a data-name=""Supreme Arcanite Magician"">Supreme Arcanite Magician</a> can only be fusion summoned with <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a>, but you can also fusion it from the graveyard with only one other spellcaster if you have <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> already in the graveyard. He can also destroy 1 card or you can draw 1 card with it, but it can be used only 2 times and only once per turn, he also has more def than <a data-name=""Arcanite Magician"">Arcanite Magician</a> for stalling.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a>, <a data-name=""Pot Of Duality"">Pot Of Duality</a>,  – The draw engine with defensive potential, you can get <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Scroll"">Witchcrafter Scroll</a> back if you have <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>, <a data-name=""Link burst"">Link burst</a> is a good combo with <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> even with link-2 monsters, and <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> is better than the other Pots, most of the time it is easy to stall one turn with traps and spells if you can not play it directly, because you can not special summon then. If you want to Link-burst <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> you can use one of the two level-1 monsters, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> to special summon them, <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> to special summon one level-1 monster, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, the tokens from <a data-name=""Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier"">Vessel Miko Of The Ice Barrier</a> or the tokens from <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>.  <a data-name=""Pacifis, The Phantasm City"">Pacifis, The Phantasm City</a>, <a data-name=""Swords Of Revealing Light"">Swords Of Revealing Light</a> – defensive cards for tokens (aqua and level-8 for <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier Of Chaos</a>), <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> and Stalling.  <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Medaillon Of The Ice Barrier"">Medaillon Of The Ice Barrier</a>, <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> - Good support cards for the fusion summons and the other cards, to get more monsters on the field.  Traps:  <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Call of The Haunted"">Call of The Haunted</a> – <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> is always a good defense, that is often good to have and not link it further because it stalls attacks for the effect-monsters, <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a> supports the combination's of the other effect monsters.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>, <a data-name=""Skill Prisoner"">Skill Prisoner</a> – Both can be used twice, so you maybe have the option of negating one important monster or to protect one important card, but both are good negation-cards.  <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>, <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> – Good Defense, <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> also supports the Supply Squad engine."

The deck is just basic Noble and Infernoble Knight bread and butter that goes into Isolde and using her effect to dump cursed bamboo to the graveyard and search off any of the other bamboo swords. Burning Bamboo will allow you to skip your opponent's main phase 1 if you activate another bamboo sword card on the field. Retrieving the Cursed Bamboo from the GY can be done with  Renaud's effect from the hand. Searching for the Cursed Bamboo can be done with Glory of the Noble Knights as well.  &nbsp;  This is just a fun gimmick that I worked on recently so I'll continue looking to make more changes, feel free to give any suggestions of any changes you'll add.  Here's a link of test hand example of what the basic combo is : https://youtu.be/YsEvCAXljRI"

And you already know that it's a Traptrix deck that uses the two new support cards they got in Lightning Overdrive.  Traptrix Ginalloa, their new Effect Monster, can Special Summon herself from the hand by sending one of your set Traps to the Graveyard. And if your backrow is empty, she can banish herself from the Graveyard to set a Trap Hole from your Graveyard. Unfortunately, you can only use one of these two effects per turn. While this con is a bit of a hinderance, Ginalloa is still good enough to run at at least 2 copies. Thanks to her Special Summoning effect, I've been able to win with Borrelsword on later turns of duels!  &nbsp;  As for the Link 2, Traptrix Utricularia is also pretty good. Once per turn, you can reset one of your activated Trap Holes instead of sending it to the Graveyard. This effect synergizes well with Ginalloa if she was Special Summoned by her effect. After pitching one of your Traps to summon Ginalloa, you can use her and another Traptrix to summon Ultricularia, whose first effect can stop you from losing one of your Trap Holes. Her second effect is also pretty good, allowing you to Special Summon a Traptrix from the Graveyard during your End Phase. One of the best monsters to summon with this is Dionaea, whose effect sets a Trap Hole from your Graveyard, which you can then use on your opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  Traptrix Nation, as a deck, functions as you expect a Traptrix deck to. It's either go first or burst. Although if you want to go on the offensive, this deck uses a Utopia Double engine, in addition to Borrelsword Dragon."

This is a budget version of the deck (excluding extra deck which has a bunch of mostly unused cards, just don't buy 'em, they aren't needed, and side deck, that has some other possible cards that at least one of costs more), so it can be improved, but it works pretty well as is.

Also, quick question: Have you read Misc?","  So the December 2020 TCG Banlist was revealed recently, and as it turns out...Miscellaneousaurus did not get hit! So my favorite deck is still at full power! UCT is still da real MVP!  This deck's name is a reference to one of my older Dinosaur decks, ""UCT Is MVP!"" (Link: https://ygoprodeck.com/uct-is-mvp/)  Anyways, unlike it's inspiration, this deck doesn't use one of the most degenerate Link 2s ever. *fake cough* Halqifibrax. So this is basically your typical competitive Dino deck. While it does do good going first, it would be in your best interest to go second due to backrow removal being used in the Main Deck. Not to mention the 9 hand traps.  &nbsp;  In case you're wondering why Knightmare Cerberus is in the main deck, it's because if you manage to summon Gamma and Driver (or a monster in addition to Nibiru) going second with Lost World on the field, you can use both monsters to link summon Knightmare Cerberus, and use its effect on one of your opponent's Tokens. Then you can use Lost World's final effect to destroy a Baby or Petit in your hand/Deck instead. So I put Cerberus in the Extra Deck so I can destroy Baby or Petit with Lost World as often as possible.  &nbsp;  And finally, because I'm just a petty little *BLEEP!*, I side-decked Mystic Mine."

Made famous after taking 2nd place at YCS Portland, I would not be surprised to see the deck get a few more tops soon (even if they are only in pro level online tournaments).  The key to this deck is to break your opponents board and turbo out Gren Maju for the OTK. Gizmek Orochi, Pot Of Desires and Golden Castle are key to this ability to turbo, you can banish most of the deck in your first turn.  The handtrap lineup I feel is currently the best it can be for the deck. Dimension Shifter is an amazing card that essentially gives you a free turn against most meta decks, whilst Psyframe Gamma was included purely to stop the opponent from disrupting often key effects such as Stormberg's summon from deck and the draw off of desires. I have also included Psyframelord Omega in the side, which can be used to rip a card from the opponents hand. This effect is useful for when forced to go first or if you cannot quite facilitate the OTK on your turn. Gamma is also pretty decent in general to disrupt the opponents plays on their turn too.  Treble Super Poly and Dark Ruler No More are both included, for the simple that you will want to see at least one against pretty much every meta deck out there in order to make your plays safer and board break at the same time.  The extra deck is pretty flexible. A decent enough array of Super Poly targets, N'tiss to punish Dogmatika, Omega for hand ripping and also allowing you to use Gamma again instead of it being a virtual dead draw after turn one. And finally Dingirsu, Hope Harbinger and Sanaphond arguably the best rank 8's in the game, period. The last 3 slots are arguably the most flexible slots.  The side deck is mainly floodgates for going first. TCBOO and Dimensional Barrier have amazing overlap with eachother. Draitrons rely on ritual mechanics, Virtual World relying on Synchros, Zoodiacs rely on XYZ's do D-Barrier is very effective against them. Whilst TCBOO stops decks with one main typing, while also having some overlap with D-Barrier for certain engines. Macros is there to keep a permanent state of banishing, which often forces the opponent to either use resources to remove it or they lose. Imperial Order is used to stop very spell dependent decks, although it can stop things like the protection effect of Stormberg, if i'm using it it means it'll hurt the opposition more than me. Plus it doesn't stop Stormberg's mandatory banish cost, which still helps Gren Maju/Eater Of Millions facilitate OTK's.

And I was like ""hey, that sounds like a fun build to make with the new OCG support"", so I made it. The OCG support actually helps a lot with field swarming without many restrictions, and going into more usable Synchros. We also have a frog engine for the boy Toadally, since he's now unlimited (I can hear Rata sobbing). So here it is. God save my soul. Update: I beat True Draco with this. This deck is actually surprisingly strong for Ice Barrier. <span>Deck guide <span>1x Grunard- Grunard helps in part with field swarming, as you can easily get out more Ice Barrier's with his effect, which is helpful due to the slowness of the archetype. Though, some new support makes up for it, so you may want to side him out in some match ups. He's also a 28k body and a level 8 for synchros. </span></span>2x Gantala- Gantala was originally the best card of the archetype, before we got the new, actually usable support. Gantala is still a solid monster, even if he's been powercrept by the new support. He allows you to revive more Ice Barriers from the grave, which also helps to make up for the lack of field swarming. Although, it happens int he end phase, making it a bit slow. He's also a 27k body and a level 7 for synchros. 2x Raiho- Raiho is the deck's main source of negates, and fairly solid ones at that. Every single monster effect they try to activate is negated, unless they discard a card from hand. This makes it so your opponent has to dump their entire hand to the grave just to play, including the cards they dont want to dump (because not everything has a graveyard effect) and makes Raiho a hand rip and negate in one, putting your opponent into a tight position. Raiho's also a fairly mediocre 21k body and a level 6 for synchros. 3x Wayne- Wayne is another new support card that's amazing for field swarming. As long as your opponent controls a monster and you control a Ice Barrier, you can special summon him, which is great for going second. On summon, he searches an Ice Barrier spell (as there's no Ice Barrier traps, but he mentions Ice Barrier traps in the text oddly enough), which is great for more set up. And on legs, he's a Macro Cosmos for spells/traps, which can cripple some decks like Sky Strikers. 3x Mirror Master- Mirror Master's first effect, the tribute one, is pretty useless, although it does stop God decks and Monarchs, so that's nice. It's second effect, though, is great. It can discard a card to summon an Ice Barrier tuner from deck, most likely Frost Spirit (who we'll get into later), for an easy and powerful synchro. And in the grave, if an Ice Barrier would send a card from hand for an effect (AKA mirror master lol), it can banish itself from grave instead, making using Mirror Master easier. 3x Miko- Miko's first effect is pretty useless, although it can do stuff with like, enemy controller or something lol. Although it's other effects are pretty solid; it allows you to special summon it if you control an Ice Barrier, making for easy field swarming. It also allows you to banish itself from grave to summon a token to your field, which can be used for more plays like tributing the Generals out or something like that. 3x Defender- Defender is, not great. It's stun effect is slow and easy to out. It's only really played because it's a tuner. In some situations, though, it's stun effect can be of use. 2x Cryomacer- similar to Defender, Cryomancer has a slow and bad stun effect that's only really useful in some situation's. Cryomancer is mainly just played for being a Tuner. In some situations, though, it's stun effect could be of use. 2x Attendant- Attendant is solid for getting out the larger General's, as it tributes itself to summont hem from hand. Although, Attendant tends to eat up your normal summon and requires them to be in your hand at the time, which means it's best off at 2. And in the grave, it can reduce the level of a face up water by 2 to special summon itself. This effect can be a bit awkward but still useful for recurring resources. In a higher level focused build, Attendand's better at 3. 3x Frost Spirit- The main tuner of the deck that you want to focus on and summon off of Mirror Master. Frost Spirit's first effect is pretty useless, as you won't be leaving it on the field. It's intended purpose is to summon it out quickly, as it's a great tuner. It can send a level 3 or lower Ice Barrier from the deck to copy it's level, helping for a lot of Synchro plays and giving Gantala some fodder. While the level restriction is a bit too low for my taste, it can still climb nicely and help to fit the situation at hand. He's also adorable. Just look at him! 3x Swap Frog- Swap Frog is another great card for special summoning, as he sets up your graveyard for more Gantala plays and the such, and gets himself out easily. Frog also can load up your graveyard even more with more restrictions on summon, and is one of the main routes into Toadally, as he lacks a once per turn on his special summoning. 2x Ronin- Ronin is another piece of the Frog engine, as you can banish a lost Swap frog to easily special him out and overlay into Toadally with ease. Like Swap, he lacks a once per turn, making him easy to abuse. I also love his art and general style. 3x Ash- The deck's main staple hand trap. Nearly any modern deck searches, so Ash can negate that part of a combo and cripple it, or stop it all together, which is great for a single card. 3x Magic Triangle- Magic Triangle helps to get out even more monsters with ease in case you have a bricky hand, although it's restrictions are a bit tough. 3 might be a bit too high, so if you prefer you can play 2. 3x Medallion- Medallion is a great card for the archetype, as it's an archetypal rota to search out any monster you need to fill up the gaps in your hand. It also lacks a once per turn, making it easy to abuse. 2x Magic Triangle- Magic Triangle is the archetype's monster reborn, being quite helpful for recovering monsters and resources late game. It also helps for if you have a large board set up (somehow), as it protects all your Ice Barrier's from Extra Deck monster effects, which are very plentiful in the modern game. <span>The extra deck <span>2x Trishula, Subzero- A new version of Trishula, with a badass name, as shortening it to Trishula, Subzero sounds badass. Subzero clears out the opponent's field when going second, as it banishes 3 cards and can easily remove problem monsters/spells without targeting, which is amazing in the current game. And on destruction, Subzero summons the original Trishula from your extra deck (without negating it's effects or anything), boosts it's attack to 3300, halves the attack of all your opponent's monsters, and negates their effects. All this is permanent. It's god damn amazing, as it gives you a huge beater in Trishula with even more removal and hand ripping paired with Subzero. 1x Trishula- Trishula is still limited, sadly, but still great. Trish can rip a card from hand, field and grave, which is great for crippling the opponent's plays and their field. Although, this is only on summon, and just leaves you with a 27k beater. Subzero completely makes up for it though, as it gives you even more banishing removal without targeting, and boosts the attack of your Trishula to high levels and cripples the opponent's monsters, making Trish even easier to use. 1x Gungnir- Gungnir is another great source of removal, that's much easier to get out than Trish and Subzero. Gungnir can discard up to two cards to target that many cards your opponent controls, and destroy them. While it does target, which is a pain, Mirror Master helps with the effect and Gungnir is a nice 25k body. </span></span>  1x Brionac- Brionac is similar to Gungnir. A level 6 Synchro, like him, he does basically the same thing, but he bounces the cards instead of destroying, which can be much better in a lot of situations due to destruction effects. Aditionally, Brionac is on a 23k body, which is a bit weaker than Gungnir. 1x Dewloren- Another limited Ice Barrier synchro, as they're surprisingly powerful, even in the first wave.Dewloren can bounce opponent's cards to the hand easily to get them out of the way, and gains 500 attack for each until the end phase, which can make him a huge beater depending on the board. 2x Coral Anenome- Coral is a link-2 that's mainly used for climbing into Reef, mid- to late game, as it can revive Ice Barriers from grave to provide more Link fodder and help to link climb into Bubble Reef to finish off the game. Her second effect, though, is pretty useless. 2x Great Bubble Reef- Great Bubble Reef is a great (see what I did there?) alternative boss monster option. It's a nice link-4 that can banish Water's from grave to draw, and when it does so it gains another 600 attack on top of it's starting point of 26k, meaning it can grow into a fairly high beater to close off the game mid- to late game. 3x Toadally- Finally unlimited! Rata is mad. Anyway, Toadally helps to swarm the field with some more frogs, although it's not super notable as this deck doesn't use tons of frogs. It's second effect is more notable though, as it's one of the deck's few negates, although it does rely on you having some frogs. Aditionally, it allows you to recur your resources on it's destruction. 1x Bahamut- Bahamut is another way of getting out Toadally, instead of relying on level 2's. Bahamut can easily summon out Toadally, which is quite nice for swarming the field and such. I'm not going to make a big title for it, but we have a single side deck card- Dance Princess. She's basically an archetypal Trunade on legs that can cripple decks like Altergeist so, she's there. <span>Playing guide <span>The deck's main focus is to swarm out the field as much as possible, and do two of either things; Get out the generals, get out the Synchros, or both. You want to start off with Medallion and Triangle if you have them, to begin your plays. Afterwards, you summon out the main Ice Barrier you want on the field, most likely Mirror or Attendant. Then you can either tribute Attendant to get out a big General, or use Mirror's effect to get out a tuner. You can go into the large synchros for their strong effects from there, and if you can, try and get out a general or two with some of the special summoning conditions from the effects. The deck can't really end the game on turn 1, so afterwards it becomes more of a grind game of using the General's to grind for resources and getting our more Synchros for their high impact effects, until you can finish off the game.

I thought they could make a good synergy together so i thought, hey it could be my first hybrid deck here and one of the few I love. Time to analyze!  The deck, as mentioned before, is a hybrid featuring Eldlich and Dogmatika. I am going to have to do a lot of explaining so first things first the dogmatika part. Dogmatika focuses on making your opponents extra deck useless and sometimes at the cost of your own, meaning it is great against extra deck reliant decks like many combo decks and some control nowadays. Ecclessia is here because she is easy to summon + an add and a protection on her, definetely a 3-off. Fleur-de-lis is easy to summon in an optimal matchup and can negate a face up card making him a solid 2. Maximus is here to mill the opponents extra deck to stop their combos while giving you some advantage with options I will talk about later. Nadir is an easy add with no drawback for the deck so a definite 3. Nation is here for added protection, milling when it leaves and making your dogmatika monsters unbeatable in battle against the extra deck. Albaz is here to fuse into Titaniklad( or Bastard if you will), essentially acting as a super poly. Punishment is here to destroy annoying beatsticks by tossing some fat bois from the extra deck.  Now the Eldlich part. Edlich is the center of the synergy so you want to run 3 at all times as he mostly wont be a brick in such a spell/trap heavy deck. Now the eldixirs:White Fate at 2 as it can be bricky if you havent already summoned or yeeted Eldlich in the GY. Black Awakening is great as it summons him from the Deck. Same goes for Scarlet Saguine as well. All the eldixirs let you set Golden Land Traps from the deck when you banish them from the GY. What are these you ask? Well to put it simply they are traps that when activated are summoned as monsters with their own stats and level. If you have Eldlich on the field they can activate their own individual effects when summoned. Conquistador pops a card making him a great 3. Huaquero banishes a card from the GY, useful to stop combos and handtraps but can be kinda bricky in situations when dont need to banish anything. Guardian makes a monsters attack 0, but it is useless against decks with unaffected monsters or spell and trap reliant ones. Can be good to get rid off an annoying beatstick.On a reverse situation, Golden Land Traps except the one I am going to mention now can banish themselves from the GY to set an Eldixir from the deck. Golden Land Forever! is your counter trap that can negate anything at the cost of Eldlich or one of the Golden Land Traps in their monster form. Finally Cursed El Dorlando is another way to add mainly Eldlich and has great synergy with him, as you can use his effect to pop it and trigger the floating effect of Dorlando.  The extra deck features Titaniklad, which you will be summoning with Albaz. N'tss for when it is yeeted from there to pop something on the field. Skull knight you can banish from the GY to pop a monster. These two are your primary targets for Maximus, Nation and anything that tosses them in the GY. Gangaridai and Superdimensional boi are great xyz to go into as a plan B with Eldich as material. The latter is a great target for the aforementioned punishment as it has a 5000 atk chonk.  This is the deck! I hope you like it! Now go out there and show em that the Heavens and the Golden Land ain't gonna ignore any corruption and sin!"

This deck has many options in terms of how you approach your plays and has been a really fun deck to use. It's easy to learn as well, with a explanation of how to do certain combos to ensure a good win.  &nbsp;  For the barrier statue combo going first, you only need 2 out of these 3 cards, Misc, Oviraptor and or/ Babycerasaurus, you can use fossil dig to get the other card you need, or another card like a Kaiju to pop a monster if you have all 3. You'll need Fossil Dig if you don't have Oviraptor or Misc, but the deck is pretty consistent with draws, so there shouldn't be an issue, unless you draw into Barrier Statue, which is the garnet of the deck. First, you need to summon Souleating Oviraptor, get either Babycerasaurus or  Miscellaneousaurus (whichever one you don't have) , send Miscellaneousaurus to the GY, protecting your dinos in the process, and banish it to special summon Animadorned Archosaur, use that card to pop Babycerasaurus, to not only get a Double Evolution Pill, but also to summon another Babycerasaurus. Use Souleating Oviraptor to destroy the special summoned Babycerasaurus, to bring back the other Babycerasaurus in the GY, and use the floating effect to special summon Giant Rex. Then, Link Summon Linkuriboh using Animadorned Archosaur, then go into Reprodocus, by using either Giant Rex Or Babycerasaurus, but DON'T use Souleating Oviraptor, keep that on the field. After bringing out Reprodocus, pause and use your Double Evolution Pill, Banish Giant Rex and Linkuriboh (or any other non-Dinosaur), then bring out Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, and since Giant Rex was Banished, you can Special Summon it to the field, and then by using the Souleating Oviraptor still on the field and Giant Rex, you can go into either Evolzar Dolkka, Laggia or any other R4nk you choose. Use the Reprodocus to change the monster it's pointing to, to change it to Winged-Beast, then use the Reprodocus and the monster it's pointing to, bring out Simorgh, Bird Of Sovereignty, which will allow you to bring out Barrier Statue Of The Stormwinds at the end. If done correctly, at the end phase your board should look like this:  <img class="""" src=""https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/771109076989378571/788413031461421066/epic_moment_2.PNG"" alt="""" width=""785"" height=""333"" />  Now, you have a board which negates most special summons with Barrier Statue and a card to protect it from being targeted by card effects, a Solemn Strike on legs to protect your board and a UTC to help you whittle your opponent's LP away.  If going 2nd, you could bring out a Pentestag to use alongside UCT's Flip-Face Down effect, allowing for a surefire win if done well, but going 2nd is mostly the same.  &nbsp;  With the True Kings, you can use either Dogoran or Miscellaneousaurus to bring out True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher, or if you're trying to bring out True King Lithosagym, the Disaster you could use Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon to bring it out and then combo off the effects of those to possibly bring out to Level 4's to bring out a R4nk or Pentestag. You could go into VFD with the True Kings, possibly with a UCT and Evolzar, you have a surefire OTK.  &nbsp;  The other cards in the main deck are the ever reliable PSY-Framegear Gamma and Frame Driver combo, a great hand trap for the format, along with a Pankratops, easily searchable by many cards in this deck, allowing for you to not only pop your opponent's card but also set up the GY for a Double Evolution Pill or Misc Special Summon. Harpie's Feather Duster, Terraforming and Monster Reborn are great extra tech options to help out with your combos. There's Red Reboot as well, a very useful handtrap which has come in handy many times for me, so I've added it here.  &nbsp;  The Extra deck has some R4nk cards you could go into, Tornado Dragon can be Summoned even with Barrier Statue, so it's great for removing backrow and allowing you to Special Summon again if things go sour, and Abyss Dweller, a great floodgate for the GY. Of course, there's Evolzar Laggia and Dolkka, staple XYZ's for any Dino deck, along with VFD, a very powerful card currently in this format. Secure Gardna is great LP protection and Pentestag is a great Link-2 when combined with UCT. Knightmare Phoenix of course, to help with any S/T and allowing you to go +1 in the proccess. There's the Linkuriboh, Reprodocus and Simorgh combo of course, but as well is PSY-Framelord Omega, which I've found to be very useful to bring back banished cards, which this deck does quite a bit, and is easily summoned with Gamma and Driver.  &nbsp;  In terms of the side deck, you have the usual suspects, S/T removal with Cosmic Cyclone, as Eldlich is very popular right now, banishing S/T is better than simply popping backrow in certain situations, Nibiru, Ghost Ogre and Droll for your Hand Traps, all have worked well in this deck, and Survivals' End, which if used along with Lost World and Juraegg Tokens brought out by it, can not only get you R4nk or Link Material, it also can destroy one of your cards and one from your opponent's side too. You can use it to combo off with Babycerasaurus possibly brought out by Oviraptor, getting more fodder out, but can also be a good option to get rid of your opponent's cards too, with the benefit of you setting up your field and or GY.  &nbsp;  Overall, this has been a really fun deck to play, with many options with how you can approach your duel, with the benefit of being easy to learn and master the many combos here. I've been using this deck and have had some good success with it, and will continue to use it in the future. As the great Farfa once said:  &nbsp;  <span>BRRRRRRRRRR DINO MONSTER WHEEE SPECIAL SUMMON SPECIAL SUMMON SPECIAL SUMMON</span>  &nbsp;  fin.  &nbsp;  (Thanks to LifeHacks for teaching me the barrier statue combo, he helped me build this deck, so check his stuff out here:  https://ygoprodeck.com/author/lifehacks/ )"

I'm actually a big fan of classical comic book heroes and such so the archetype does appeal to me, although I do hate some of their designs, as they're just roided out and have no effort put into them. But, they still have a fun play style and give me a lot of nostalgia. This is a more ""protect the castle"" type build centered around Dark Law, where you want to go first, summon out Dark Law, and protect him for as long as possible. Fun fact: Me and Toon are eldritch horrors from beyond the comprehension of time and space. Update: Added in the Xtra Heroes and replaced Diamond Dude with E-Call. <span>Deck guide <span>2x Plasma- Plasma is a fairly strong card to end off with, although it can be a bit situational due to requiring 3 monsters to summon. Though, it is worth it, as he is a Skill Drain on legs and can grow to be a big beater if you're going second, making Plasma a solid card to use for end boards. 2x Malicious- the most we can run as of now, Malicious is a great card for swarming the field. There's a good amount of cards in the deck that dump Heroes to grave, like Faris, so you can easily dump a Malicious and then banish it to get out another Malicious for more fodder. Additionally, Malicious is a D-hero, giving it synergy with Fusion Destiny since that makes it even easier to dump into the grave and plus off of it. It's also a great target for Mask Change. </span></span>  <span>3x Diamond Dude- One of the older D-heroes, Diamond Dude is a fairly solid (see what I did there?) card. While he is slow, he can still set up your grave and gives you a spell effect to activate at any time on your next turn, which is fantastic. He's a bit slow for the current game though, so depending on your build you might want to cut down on the Diamond Dudes. 3x Honest Neos- Honest Neos helps a lot with the ""protect the castle"" style of the deck. The main flaw of Dark Law is that he has low attack, which makes it a bit annoying to use him. Honest Neos makes up for that, as whenever your opponent tries to attack him or anything, you can boost Dark Law's attack to avoid him being destroyed. 3x Solid Soldier- Solid Soldier helps a lot with field swarming, as on summon, he specials out another Hero to the field, which can activate their effects (namely Dark Mist) and, when sent to grave when used for a fusion, it specials out another monster from grave, allowing for great resource reccursion. 3x Shadow Mist- Shadow Mist searches out the key cards of the deck, Mask Change, on special summon. That clause makes it a bit annoying to use, but it's still fine because it can be used off of cards like Solid Soldier to search. And when sent to the grave, it adds a Hero to hand. You can only use one of these effects per turn, but it's still solid, as that makes it a great target for either Solid Soldier, Faris, or a fusion spell. 3x Stratos- On summon, Stratos searches out a majority of the deck, which is a fantastic effect, as it fills the gaps in your hand for more plays. It can also remove backrow, but the searching is much better than the backrow removal. 3x Faris- Faris fills up the grave with Heroes that you want in the grave, like Malicious, to easily swarm the field and get more board presence. It also allows you to load up your backrow with more Vision heroes, for more effects. 3x Vyon- Vyon sets up your grave for more plays, likely Malicious for more field presense and fodder for fusions and Dark Law. Vyon has another effect to banish a Hero from grave to search Poly, but this deck doesn't run regular Poly in favor of  of archetypal fusion spells. 1x Increase- Increase is a nice card to have in the grave, to discourage the opponent from attacking until they manage to get it away.  Increase is better off getting from the deck by the effect of Varis, though, as it allows you to tribute Faris and get itself onto the field. On summon, it specials another Hero from deck, for more field presence and swarming. 3x Ash- Ash is a staple a hand trap in basically any modern deck deck, as it cripples tons of combos and strategies and can entirely end them, as most modern decks rely on searching. 3x Fusion Destiny- One of the deck's main fusion spells, it's used to turbo out the Destiny Heroes since it uses materials from the deck, which is great to get them out as fast as possible.  Although it does destroy them, it's slow to destroy them and you can quickly close off the game in that time as long as you get a high attack monster. 3x Mask Change-  Mask Change is another one of the deck's key cards, that you want to get as fast as possible, whether it be drawing into it from your starting hand or searching it off of Mist. Mask Change allows you to turbo into Dark Law for the control and ""protect the castle"" focus, or another one of the Masked Heroes depending on what attribute you have out. 2x Mask Change II- Mask Change II is basically the overcomplicated back up Mask Change, which we use in case we're out of Mask Changes or if we need extra extra copies of it. 3x Desires- Desires is the deck's main draw spell, as it's a more balanced Pot of Greed to draw 2 and banisht he top 10. While banishing the top 10 sucks and you run the risk of banishing some important cards, it's easy to use Desires after your search plays or to simply risk it. <span>Extra Deck <span>2x Dystopia- Dystopia is another target for Fusion Destiny, as it gives you some burn damage on the opponent (which can be large depending on your graveyard setup), and when you boost it with Honest Neos, you get a simple but helpful pop, which it becomes a 28k beater afterwards. </span><span>2x Dangerous- Dangerous allows you to load up the grave with tons of Destiny Heroes, and boost to a much higher leveled attack for a big beater and get some graveyard setup. </span></span></span>  <span>1x Dominance- Dominance is a big 29k beater, who can alter the opponent's deck to top deck something useless at the time and fuck with their plays. It also gives you draw power on monster destruction, and on destruction, brings back basically allt he monsters you used for it's fusion, so it can bring more fodder for even more fusions. 1x Dusktopia- Dusktopia is a bit hard to get out normally, but is A) Compeltely worth it, and B) Fusion Destiny makes it so much easier to get out than it would normally be. On summon, it allows you to fusion summon another Fusion, helping to swarm the field with big monsters. Aditionally, it can give protection to your other monsters, although your opponent takes no damage from it, which is a pain. Dusktopia is also a 3k beater. 3x Dark Law- Dark Law is the deck's main boss monster, and the only fusion monster at 3. Dark Law banishes all cards sent to the grave, which can cripple nearly all modern strategies, as nearly all of them rely on the graveyard for plays. Aditionally, when your opponent searches a card, it banishes a card from your opponent's hand at random, also crippling their hand. You mainly want to protect Dark Law due to his low attack, mainly using Honest Neos to avoid him being destroyed if your opponent even gets close to that. 1x Blast- Blast is a good target for Mask Change on Stratos, and can cripple a big beater so you can properly beat over it. Aditionally, you can pay a small amount of life points in order to bounce back backrow, crippling decks like Altergeist. 1x Koga- Koga is a target for cards like Honest Neos,and was originally a target for Adjusted Gold, but I cut Adjusted Gold. Koga, similar to purgatrio, grows to be a big beater against swarm decks and punishes decks like D-link that build huge boards. Aditionally, it can cripple the attack of some monsters by banishing a hero from grave to  beat over problem monsters. 1x Dian- Dian is a target for cards like Solid Soldier, and at a nice 28k attack, it can beat over lots of stuff. When it does, it can special a level 4 or lower Hero from deck, allowing you to extend your plays into main phase 2. 1x Anki- Anki is basically a more aggresive alternative for Dark Law, in mid to late game when you need to finish off the game. Anki has a solid attack, meaning it can beat over monsters easily to search out a Mask Change when it destroys them, and can also attack directly with halved attack in case you need a small amount of damage to finish the game. Dark Law is superior to Anki though, and is priority. 1x Divine Wind- Divine Wind is a psuedo attack lock on some swarm decks, and gives you draw power when it destroys monsters by battle. Not much more to say here. <span>Playing guide</span></span>  The deck's main goal is to turbo out Fusions, namely Dark Law, but it can also get out some more fusions alongside Dark Law to build up damage and board presence to pressure the opponent, alongside Dark Law's powerful control effects. To achieve this, you want to go through some usual combos; your normal summon will usually be Stratos or Solid, to search or gain field presense. If you do Solid, you want to special out Mist to get out one of the most important cards in the deck, Mask Change. Afterwards, you can use Special Summoning cards like Faris to build up more board presence and fodder for fusions, and load up the grave for Malicious plays. Then once you have all the monsters you can get out onto the field, you want to play Destiny Fusion, Mask Change, etc to go into your large fusions and build the strong board. Note you'll be going first for this. Then you just play the grind game and once your opponent can't do shit, you close them off quickly."

Sometimes I am able to build 7-9 level Synchros but I don't have them in the Extra Deck. I think this way allows me to play different level Extra Deck Monsters, depending on which of the many Penguins are on my field.  I now have 9 Tuners which gives me more versatility.  I haven't played this variation of the deck yet, so this is more of a placeholder of the cards I would like to throw into it. Let me know if you have any tips on what you would do with these potential cards in a deck?"

The deck can brick but has multiple routes to go to if you cannot open knightmare iblee or put a blue-eyes white dragon card on the field. It can easily win games because people forget that chaos MAX can do double piercing damage and is basically unaffected by card effects."

They are like not a win condition but really good cards.  ok now how to do a 3+ negate herald of the ultimateness  first of all you need benten and a level 1 draitron to tribute it  let's say you have benten and aldibah in your hand activate aldibah tribute benten, benten search herald of the ultimateness, aldibah search ritual spell activate ritual spell tribute aldibah summon herald of the ultimateness. if you don't like this you can always search diviner of the heralds by tributing benten. normal summon diviner --&gt; effect send herald of the arclight to the graveyard --&gt; herald of the arclight effect search ultimateness od the ritual spell whatever you want.  i said a lot about benten and you can ask -ersander how do you get benten? +thuban searches benten, preparation of rites searches benten, and benten searches benten :)  so basically there are 9 bentens in this deck and 1 benten is 3 bentens  ok now ultimateness is on the field and what?  ultimateness is not a once per turn card it can activate as many times as you want but resources for herald are limited. the best resource is eva which is a level 1 light fairy. since it is a light fairy benten can search it and it is a level one so where arf thou searches too. eva is basically 3 negates with ultimateness  ultimateness eff --&gt; send eva --&gt; eva eff --&gt; banish 2 search 2 --&gt; now you have 2 more negates for the ultimateness  that concludes the first win condition  now is the time for my favorite win condition V A N İ T Y ' S    R U L E R  summon 2 level 1 draitron and tribute summon vanity's ruler . END OF THE DUEL  last but not least archetype bosses QUA: this is 4k attack untargetable by s/t(odin , father of aesir) + monster reborn for archetype + feather duster DRA: untargetable by monster effects + attack all special summoned monsters once each + destroy 2 face-up cards BUT only during your opponents turn"

I've been trying to make a real Kaiju Deck that can be effective for a while now. All the decks I've found that had Kaiju in the description just had like 2 Kaijus max (not a Kaiju deck to me sorry). This started out as a control deck. It still has some of the control elements but with the fossil cards it now also has some agression behind it. The White Aura Whale is supposed to be Fossil Machine Skull Convoy. I've been having a lot of success with this deck lately, the it's only downsides are that when you get somewhat of a dead hand (which doesn't happen often but still) it bricks big time! That's why I added pot of desires for draw power, although I wish I could have picked something else because there is always the danger that you can banish some key card that you need right now by accident (and also because of the pot this deck is 41 cards, which the perfectionist in me kind of hates...). The main strategy should be to not go overboard, but be agressive at the right moment. The Fossil Fusion Monsters can deliver OTKs pretty quickly, so if you put them on the field at the right moment and have some Kaiju here and there as well you are good to go (I love to have Gameciel with Waterfront together with Skull Convoy on the field, it's such a good and simple board). About the side deck: I do have some cards in there but some of the are just fillers and I'm not really sure what would be best to put there (also I couldn't figure out how to add cards to the side deck in this Deck Builder ooops). Anyways, I hope ya'll like it and are able to have fun with this deck, especially those people that really wanted a deck that makes Kaijus shine."

This deck is not quite fully done yet but you yourself after using it a bit could make your own changes to it to make it even better. This deck does great against synchro decks in general because of some of  the effects of Meklord monsters that specifically target synchro monsters. In this deck there are 3 main monster. Depending on the deck you are facing against makes the decision of what boss monster you want to use. So pay attention to your opponent in the first round. In this deck you can otk. But takes a while to learn this deck and make it good to the point your opponent gets scared because of how much attack is being done.

When you are trying to link climb the mean goal is to get as many link summoning's as possible. the mean goal is to quickly get quantum out then use wikid to link climb from your hand using the hand link condition cards. So first you wanna draw balance lord and cyberse gadget and then summon balance lord and use his effect to summon gadget then you wanna link to wikid and use gadget effect to ss token to a zone kid point to then use kid effect to banish balance lord and balance lord will let you add the cyberse synchron then use link kid toss that tuner and synchro to level 3 tuner then use level 3 tuner effect to ss cyberse sychron back then use cyberse synchron effect to double synchros level then go into quantum. Then you gonna want to use your hand effects to link to transcode then use micro code to add optimization then you can use trans to get back kid and link to accescode.

Also, by the way, my posts and such might be sparratic for the rest of this month; busy with the holidays. </span> <span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Analyzer- Analyzer is the main starter card for the Adamancipator, as his special summoning  condition is easy. As long as you search him or see him in your opening hand, you can special him to proc the other's effects to special the rest. That leaves your Normal Summon open for the Sky Strikers, who need it. Aditionally, Analyzer does the funky excavation, to search out and special the rocks for quick synchros. </span> <span>2x Seeker- Seeker is another one of the Adamancipator's, which you want to special summon off of having Anaylzer on the field and SS'd, so you can special summon Seeker easily. Then, like Analyzer, you can excevate and get out even more rocks for more synchros. </span> <span>2x Researcher- Like Seeker, Researcher is very easy to get out as long as you've gotten off Analyzer and Seeker. And like the others, she does the funky excavation and special summoning of the rocks, allowing you to go into more synchros quickly and build up your board. </span> <span>2x Leonite- Leonite is the first crystal, and allows you to recover your Ada resources, albeit slowly, as you put the GY ones on top of the deck (you will never be putting ones from the hand on top). It also allows you to bounce back Leonite 2: Electric Boogaloo to topdeck itself, but that's a really bad effect. </span> <span>2x Dragite- When being summoned by one of the excevation effects, it draws a card, which is pretty nice as long as you top deck something to extend plays. Similarly to Leonite, it allows you to bounce back Dragite 2: Electric Boogaloo to the extra deck to top deck itself, but that's still a really bad effect.</span> <span>1x Raptite- On summon of an excevation effect, it allows you to topdeck one of the Adamancipator's in your grave, so it's a slower revival effect basically. And, like the rest, he has the shitty bounce effect. </span> <span>3x Raye- Raye is one of the key cards of the Sky Striker strat, as it's also the deck's main normal summon. It leads straight into any of the Links, and on summon, can also get out Roze alongside herself for either a link-2 or two Sky Strikers. And in the grave, it can (slowly) recover itself if one of your Links is destroyed, to lead into another Sky Striker link. </span> <span>3x Roze- As long as you normal summon a Raye, you can special out a Roze alongside her. Roze allows you to either go into Zeke, or two Sky Striker link-1's, which is quite nice to all have out for field swarming capabilites. And when an opponent's monster in the Extra Monster zone leaves the field, she can special summon herself and negate a opponent's monsters effect. While this can be more situational due to us being in Master Rule 5, it's still fairly strong.</span> <span>3x Gamma- Gamma is the deck's main hand trap, as it can negate literally anything and get a body on the field doing so. The main drawback of Gamma is that it requires a garnet (Driver), but Driver at 1 means it's rare to draw into it and easier to use Gamma and recycle Driver. </span> <span>1x Driver- A shitty garnet for Gamma. It doesn't even look cool like other Garnets. </span> <span>3x Lapuite- Lapuite is the deck's main field spell, but can be swapped out for Mystic Mine in some situations if neccesary. Lapuite boosts the already fairly strong power of your Adamancipators, allowing you to do high damage. Additonally, after you perform your combos and such, you can top deck 5 Adamancipator cards to make even more Synchros and such if your opponent still isn't dead after that turn.</span> <span>3x Friends- Friends is the deck's main searcher for the Adamancipators, as it allows you to get whichever Rock you need that's excevated. Friends can be a bit of a pain, as you need a few Rocks out to use it optimally, but it's still fairly solid. Although, Friends is also xenophobic, locking you into Rocks for the rest of the turn, meaning you need to do your Sky Strikers first. Some variants may want to cut down on the Friends, if they're going more heavily into the Sky Strikers. </span> <span>2x Signs- Signs allows you to revive your monsters or extend your plays, whichever you need. You can revive your fallen Adamancipator Synchros that you actually want on the field, that were destroyed or something of the sort, to re-activate their effects and such. Or you can use it to re-summon the monsters you used for a synchro summon, in order to extend your plays. </span> <span>1x Multirole- Multirole allows you to give your spells protection, which is a great effect since the Spells are really vital for the Sky Striker strategy. Additionally, it allows you to set a ton of spells from your grave during the end phase, which, depending on the combos you did, can be a huge set up and can heavily interrupt the opponent's plays. </span> <span>2x Afterburners- Afterburners gives some fairly nice monster removal to get rid of the opponent's monsters and clear the field for an OTK. It also allows you to remove some backrow if it's fairly late into the Spell cycle. </span> <span>1x Hornet Drones- Hornet Drones allows you to get out a token for a quick Link, adding onto the amount of Sky Striker Link field swarming you can get in order to have a quick OTK and/or grind out the game. </span> <span>3x Shark Cannon- Shark Cannon allows you to get your opponent's key combo pieces out of play in order to heavily interrupt their plays, which is a great and solid effect on a quick play (which you can set with Multirole to fuck them over when they try making a comeback). Additionally, if you're heavily into the spell cycle, you can steal the monster. </span> <span>3x Widow Anchor- Widow Anchor is basically a better Effect Veiler, allowing you to negate a problem monster's effects and get it out of the way in order to make your plays easier to pull off. Additionally, as long as you use Widow Anchor late into the spell cycle, you can steal the monster with no restrictions (aside from being destroyed in the end phase), meaning if it's a high attack monster you can easily push for game with it. You can also set it with Multirole to heavily interrupt your opponent's plays. </span> <span>Extra deck </span>  <span>Dragite- Dragite is the deck's main Synchro boss monster, that you want to focus on getting out with the Adamancipators. It allows non targeting, not destruction removal, just by excevating cards (which benefits you) which in the current game is absolutely amazing and can clear out entire boards. And, as long as you have the original main deck Dragite in the grave, you can negate any card effect your opponent activates, which is also amazing. </span> <span>2x Leonite- Leonite allows you to search and is basically an archetypal Rota, being a Friend's with much less restrictions. Additionally, during the opponent's turn, as long as you have the original Leonite in the grave, you can special any Rock monster. This allows you to even recover the Synchros or extend plays, which is great. </span> <span>1x Raptite- Raptite allows you to get out more Rock monsters onto the field, helping to Synchro climb into Dragite. Additionally, during the opponent's turn, as long as you have the original Raptite in the grave, you can banish an opponent's card from the grave, which can heavily interrupt plays. </span> <span>2x Kagari- Kagari allows you to recover your important spells and re-use them, recurring resources with ease. Kagari also grows to be a big beater as long as you have spells in the grave, which you should have. </span> <span>2x Kaina- Kaina gives you a psuedo attack stun, which isn't super helpful, but can be somewhat helpful in some situations when you need to launch a comeback. She also gives you a very small LP recovery when you activate a Sky Striker spell, although that can add up to a big number. </span> <span>2x Shizuku- Shizuku cripples the opponent's board, as you should have tons of spells in the grave, making it much easier to run over and finish the game. Additionally, it can search out the Sky Striker spells you need for your next turn if your opponent isn't dead by then. </span> <span>2x Zeke- Zeke is the deck's main link-2, which is made with Roze and Raye instead of just Raye. He gives you easy, non destruction removal, which is really strong. Additionally, Zeke can gain high levels of attack, growing even stronger for an OTK. </span> <span>2x Hayate- Hayata can attack directly, which is fantastic for the deck, as it allows you to chip away at the opponent and help with finishing them off. Additionally, Hayate can send a Sky Striker spell from grave once it attacks, providing more fodder and set up for Multirole.</span> <span>Playing guide</span>  <span>The deck mainly operates with activating the Sky Striker spells immediately, as at the start of their turn they shouldn't control any main zone monsters. Afterwards, you need you summon out Analyzer and get out the other Adamancipator's by their conditions. Then, you normal summon out the Ace's. And after excevating heavily and setting up your board, you can link away the Ace's into the Link's to prop their effects, and Synchro climb into the Synchros. After that, you want to continually attack at your opponent non-stop, until you grind them down. </span>"

Your main boss monster is Magician of Chaos, but you can also bring out Chaos MAX Dragon or Magician of Black Chaos MAX  &nbsp;  This deck doesn't use Dragoon because I dislike that card even though it would probably make this deck a bit stronger. Besides, the main focus isn't on the Extra Deck  &nbsp;  Your main way to summon your ritual (and some fusion monsters) is by using Secrets of Dark Magic which you can search with Magician's Rod. You can also use classic ritual support (Manju, Impcantation, Preperation of Rites etc.)  need to get what you need.  &nbsp;  With Eternal Soul you can revive DM or CoM, after it is destroyed or tributed  &nbsp;  If you activate CoM's effect on opponent's turn you can destroy Artifact Scythe to prevent your opponent from using the Extra Deck  &nbsp;  Extra Deck is made out of generic DM and not-DM cards which you can bring out relatively easy considering that the Extra Deck isn't that important for the deck (besides maybe Dark Magicians and Ebon Illusion). So don't worry about Extravigance. But I did add Quintet and Magicalized Fusion to flex on people :)"

It's a going first control deck, oriented on making sure the opponent isn't allowed to do anything the entire time and then wittling their life points down slowly. Credit to the dude who's trying way too hard to be like TeamSam, AKA Yugituber  for giving me the idea. Also, this utilizes the OCG support so you may have to wait to play the full deck. Ratio update: Cut 1 Black Awakening for an extra Eldland. Also just now realized this is technically meta because of Eldlich. Update 2: Cut 1 Nepnethes and 1 Conquistador for a Sangquine. You're welcome TeamSam but worse.</span> <span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Eldlich the Golden Lord- The main boy, he's finally dropped a lot in price, making this deck (somewhat) more budget friendly in some places. Anyway, Eld is great, as he gives non-destruction removal for a ton of your opponent's problem cards and sets up your grave. Additionally, he has a great special summoning condition that's easy to fulfill and loads up your grave with spells and traps to recover later. Also, he gives off the vibes of a JoJo's villain. Someone, please give him a Stand. </span> <span>3x Atrax- Atrax helps a lot with your Holes (hee hee), as it allows you to activate them from the hand, meaning you don't have to set them and have them sitting there and be hit by S/T removal. She also makes it so your your Hole's can't be negated, which is also great, considering the current format is very heavy with negates like Gamma. </span> <span>2x Dionea- Dionea recovers the monsters you need, helping to build up into the XYZ or links to build up your backrow and such mid to late game. Additionally, when it's special summoned, it recovers all the Hole's you've used or sent for Eldlich, allowing you to reuse them even more and pressure your opponent. </span> <span>3x Myrmeleo- Myrmeleo fetches most of the traps you need, so you can set up your backrow and/or provide fodder for Eldlich in order to get him out onto the field and set up your grave. Additionally,  if it's special summoned, it can pop some  backrow, which can be helpful in some situations. </span> <span>3x Mantis- Mantis searches out all the Traptrix monsters you need for your plays, mainly Ginalloa since Mantis takes up your normal summon. Additionally, Mantis allows you to bounce back your dead backrow in order to replace it with better backrow that's of use. </span> <span>3x Ginalloa- One of the new pieces of OCG support, Ginalloa helps greatly with swarming the field and going into the XYZ/Links. Her first effect allows you to send backrow to grave to special summon her, which can set up your grave with Eldlich backrow and such. Additionally, she can banish herself from grave to re-set backrow from the grave. Although, you can only do one of these effects once per turn, which is a bit annoying.</span> <span>2x Genlisea- Genlisea is a great card for setting up huge amounts of backrow mid-to late game, in case your opponent is trying to push to make a board, so you can force them into your favored gamestate. Genlisea tributes herself to set 2 Hole traps with different names, one from deck and one from grave, which is great for recovering resources and setting up a huge backrow. </span> <span>3x Nephetes- Nephetes helps a lot with swarming the field as you activate the Holes, as when you activate a Hole she allows you to special a Traptrix from deck, helping to swarm the field and lead into link and XYZ plays. </span> <span>2x Cursed Eldland- Cursed Eldland searches out Eldlich and all of his backrow for a miniscule cost of life points, which is a great effect for filling the gaps in your hand. Additionallky, when it leaves the field, it allows you to set Eldlich backrow directly from deck, which is also fantastic. </span> <span>3x Black Awakening- Black Awakening helps with getting out Eldlich as fast as possible, and it helps as it doesn't require his cost of sending backrow to grave. It can also let you get multiple Eldliches onto field, which is great. And you can banish it from the grave to set a Golden Land trap directly from deck to backrow, helping heavily with the control focus. Although, you can only use on of these effects per turn, so it's your choice. You can set a Black Awakening and send it off of Eldlich and then banish Black Awakening for it's set, so that's a pretty cool combo. Also, for budget decks, you can replace this with White Destiny. </span> <span>3x Trap Hole Nightmare- Trap Hole Nightmare is more so a backrow Effect Veiler, as it's insurance in case your opponent gets through your Trap Holes. When they try to activate their monster effects, you can punish them and interrupt them even more. </span> <span>3x Bottomless Trap Hole- Bottomless Trap Hole is one of the deck's main backrow, as it's heavily searchable and recyclable. You want to constantly use it on your opponent's monsters, making sure they waste resources on plays and then you completely disrupt those plays. </span> <span>2x Gravedigger's- Gravedigger's heavily counters hand traps, GY decks, and banishing decks, as whenever your opponent activates a card in hand, GY, or a banished card, you can negate it and inflict 2000 burn. 2000 burn is massive for a deck that runs small monsters and has to chip away at the opponent, and Gravedigger's can protect your plays from hand traps or can compeletely stop GY decks. </span> <span>2x Golden Land Forever!- Golden Land Forever is one of the deck's main negates, as you can tribute an Eldlich to negate any effect. This is fantastic for more heavy interruptions, and the cost of tributing Eldlich isn't very major because of how heavily recycable Eldlich is. Additionally, it's heavily searchable in the deck. </span> <span>3x Conquistador- Conquistador serves as a wall of 1800, and heavily interrupts your opponent's plays as long as you have Eldlich out on the field, as it allows you to destroy one of the opponent's cards, without targeting, which is great in the current meta. and you can banish it to set a Eldlixer spell directly from deck, allowing you to swarm the field with even more Eldliches. You can only use one of these effect's per turn, but it's still great. </span> <span>The extra deck</span>  <span>3x Allomerus- Allomerus helps to recover monsters and build up your board heavily, which can allow you to build up into the links and push for game mid- to late game once your opponent has exhausted all of their resources. You can detacth 2 materials from Allo to special a Traptrix from grave, which is pretty nice for leading into Sera for more plays. Additionally, if an opponent's monster is destroyed/banished by one of our card effects, you can steal it with no restrictions. That's amazing, as you can easily steal a huge monster. </span> <span>2x Rafflesia- Rafflesia gives complete protection to all your Traptrix (except itself) from battle and card effects, which is great due to their low stats and lack of built in protection. Additionally, Rafflesia allows you  to load up your grave with Hole traps and copies their effects, making it a Hole on legs and can completely force the gamestate into your favor. </span> <span>2x Urticularia- Urticularia allows you to re-use all your trap holes, as they reset themselves instead of going to the grave. There is no restrictions on this, which is amazing, as it allows you to keep a strong backrow and not have to recur your resources from grave. And, during the end phase, it has a Gantala style effect, where it specials a Traptrix from grave, which helps a lot with field swarming. </span> <span>3x Sera- Sera is annoyingly expensive, but completely worth it. When you activate the Holes, you can special a Traptrix from deck, which can lead to a huge amount of Traptrix on grave and can lead to a ton of field presence and a massive board depending on how your turn goes. Additionally, when another Traptrix monster activates it's effect, you can set a Hole straight from deck to the backrow, which is also great for setting up a huge board/backrow.</span> <span>2x Pheonix- Pheonix is pretty much just here to make use of some of the swarming potential you can have, and to clear backrow when neccesary. Also here to fill the extra deck.</span> <span>2x Unicorn- Unicorn is a solid card for mid-to late game when you have a good amount of monsters on the field for a Link summon, so you can get the opponent's monsters out of the way in order to push for game.</span> <span>Playing guide</span>  <span>So, the deck is mainly a going first control/stun deck, although that should be obvious. You want to go first and use your normal summon on something like Myrmello or whichever Traptrix you have in hand at the time, in order to set up your field and get off their effects. Afterwards, you want to use Eldlich's effect to summon himself (or search him or summon him directly from the deck), and then set up your backrow. After that, you simply just Trap Hole everything the opponent tries and make sure they can't do anything, also forcing them to expend their resources on trying to push through, and then negating the push with things like Golden Land Forever. Mid- to late game, once you've set up a board, you want to link it away into the Traptrix Links and overlay some into the XYZ, and use the Extra Deck Traptrix to grind out the game until you finally wittle them down and push for game. </span> <span>(things to note: This deck hates going first, and Mystic Mine is something you should use in the side deck for some match ups.)</span> <span>Any suggestions or anything is appreciated. Thank you for reading!</span>"

This is a fairly fun mix of archetypes, as the milling of Lightsworns props the effects of the Shaddols and can lead into some strong fusions and Extra deck monsters to push for game. They also both have really cool lore, art, and theming.</span> <span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x General- General allows you to basically fill up your banished pile, and cripple an opponent's monster's stats by doing so, which is very helpful for running over problem monsters and for pushing for game mid to late game. </span> <span>3x Raiden- Raiden is mainly used for it's strong mill, as all in all, it allows you to mill 4 cards during your turn, which can easily prop the effects of a ton of Lightsworns and Shaddols. It also loads up your grave yard for other plays, allowing you to do even more stuff.</span> <span>3x Lumina- Lumina is a great card for extending the deck's plays and leading into XYZ and the usch, as you can banish normally non-special summonable Lightsworns from your hand to then re-special summon them. And, when another Lightsworn activates it's effect, you can mill 3. This is great with cards like Felis and Raiden, as with Felis it unclogs your hand and gives you removal with a mill of 6; with Raidin, it gives you a mill of 5 and can lead into either Curious or Michael. </span> <span>1x Felis- Felis is best  to keep in deck to be milled or summoned off of Lumina. When milled, she allows you to special summon herself.   Felis gives you a pop for the opponent and  then mill's 3, activating a ton of Shaddol effects and filling up your grave. </span> <span>1x Beast- Beast gives some small draw power when sent to the grave, which isn't major but still can be fairly nice. </span> <span>2x Squamata- When it's sent, Squamata allows you to send more Shaddol cards from deck to grave. This is great because it activates their effects for whatever you need, and fills up your grave for later plays. </span> <span>2x Wendi- Wendi helps with field swarming and getting more mosnters on board for fusions. You can also use the face downs to actually activate their flip effects sometimes, although you're better off just fusing them away. </span> <span>2x Hedghehog- Hedghehog fetches all the Shaddol monsters you need for fusions and such, as it fills the gaps in your hand when sent to the grave. Hedghehog is generally pretty fantastic. </span> <span>2x Keios- Keios helps to buff up your monsters when you're trying to push for game, as it helps to raise their attack stats to run over large monsters or deal a ton of damage. Additionally, Keios props the effects of other Shaddols. </span> <span>3x Ryko- Ryko gives you non-targeting, non destruction removal at the small cost of banishing a Lightsworn (which can easily be got back by Lumina), which in the current game is fantastic. It also mills 3 when a Lightsworn activate's its effect, which is great for milling a ton. </span> <span>3x Ash- You should know why I play this by know. </span> <span>3x Charge- Charge is an amazing card in this deck and a staple 3 of. It's cost is pure plussing, as it mills three without taking up a summon and fills up your grave with propping Shaddol effects. And if it's uninterrupted, Charge adds a Lightsworn monster to fill in the gaps of your hand.</span> <span>2x Solar Recharge- Solar Recharge is a great draw spell, as it's a nice draw 2 and mill's 2 to activate Shaddol effects, all at the cost of discarding a single Lightsworn (which is why it's at 2), which can be used to set up your grave for other plays. </span> <span>3x Nephe- Nephe is a great card for summoning a lot of the Fusions, as it alters the attributes of your Shaddols so you can properly fuse into a lot of the Shaddol fusions that require specific attributes. Nephe also allows you to fuse into a Shaddol monster with the equipped monster and monsters on field/hand, going into beeg Shaddols. The fusion also props their ""going to grave"" effects, extending your plays.</span> <span> 3x El Shaddol Fusion- El Shaddol Fusion is another fusion spell for the Shaddols, allowing you to go into more of the Shaddols, this time without having you summon one (unlike the equip). El is also a quick play, meaning you can fuse during either turn to interrupt your opponent's plays heavily. </span> <span>Extra deck</span>  <span>2x Michael- Michale is fairly easy to go into, with a Raiden and another Lightsworn (most likely a Lumina, depending on your opening hand). Michael is great for non-destruction removal, as while it does target, it banishes, not destroys. Michael also allows you to recycle any number of Lightsworns into the deck from grave and gain a miniscule 300 LP for each, mills 3 during the end phase, and is a 26k beater.</span> <span>2x Minerva- Minerva starts off with a simple effect of detaching a material to mill 3, which is great for propping the effects of Shaddols to extend your plays and make some fusions. And when Minerva is destroyed by battle or card effect, it mills 3 and destroys opponent's cards (without targeting) equal to the number of Lightsworns you milled with it, which can be great for blowing up the board so you can launch a comeback. Minerva is generally simple, but solid.</span> <span>2x Curious- Curious is fairly hard to make, but can be completely worth it. On destruction, it bounces a card from your grave back to your hand, recycling resources.On summon, it sends any card from your deck to the grave, not just from the top, making Curious a foolish burial on legs. It also easily props the Shaddols without leaving it up to luck. Additionally, when a card is sent from the deck to the grave (whether it be by milling or by Curious' own Foolish burial), you can mill the top 3. </span> <span>1x Shekhinga- Shekhinga is a negate on legs, which for this deck is great, as it doesn't have many negates. Shekhinga can negate special summoned monster effects by your opponent by sending Shaddol cards from your hand to the grave, which is actually a great cost, as it generates advantage for you by negating. Shekhinga also recovers Shaddol spells when sent to the grave.</span> <span>1x Anoytalis- Anoytalis is more so a floodgate on legs, as it makes it so your opponent can't special summon monsters from hand or grave using spells/traps. This sounds oddly specific, but can be quite strong against some match ups. Like others, it recovers Shaddol spells/traps (i'm not going to always say this so this is your last time hearing my beautifal text line say it).</span> <span>3x Construct- The main boss monster of the deck, Construct is fantastic. On summon, it fills up your grave with the Shaddols and activates their effects, extending your plays even more and filling up your grave. When Construct battles a Special Summoned monster, it destroys it without counting in battle damage, whcih is amazing since most boss monsters are special summoned. </span> <span>1x Grysta- Grysta is a great negate on legs, as whenever your opponent would summon a monster, you can send a Shaddol card to negate the summon and destroy the monster. Like Shekinga, this is amazing, as it's a negate that generates you more advantage. </span> <span>1x Wendigo- Wendigo is mainly here to wall up, but if i'm gonna be honest, also because I find her adorable. Not actually a very good card but too cute to pass up.</span> <span>1x Winda- Winda is an amazing floodgate that's easy to summon in the deck, due to all the dark's. Each player can only summon one mosnter while she's face up, which, while it does hurt us, still is a great monster to drop on an end board so the opponent can barely do anything or has to dedicate resources to getting rid of it.</span> <span>1x Alkapone- Alkapone allows you to basically permanently effect veiler a card, negating it's effects for the rest of the game, which is great for outing problem cards like Appolousa. It also has battle protection (which isn't super important but makes it annoying to deal with), and when it's sent to grave, it allows you to add any Shaddol card from deck to hand, then discard a card.</span> <span>Deck guide</span>  <span>The deck's main strategy is to go first, mill a ton of cards, and set up an endboard of some fusions/synchros/ whatever you can get out.You'll want to Summon your main mill cards like Raiden, whether it be normal summoning them or summoning them off of Lumina. Afterwards, you should mill a ton to activate Shaddol effects and search and the such, allowing you to refill your hand, summon more monsters, etc. Then you can go into a Michael, Curious, etc, and then fuse your remaining Shaddols into a fusion. Afterwards, the deck just gets really grindy and just mills until it decks out or beats the shit out of the opponent with the big extra deck monsters. </span> <span>(Things to note: This is mainly a going first deck, and Mystic Mine is a good option to replace Desires with in some match ups.) </span> <span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated, as always. Have a good day!</span>"

The Cards are expected to come out in 03/2021.  In the Anime, the Deck was used by Spectre in VRAINS.  In the End, you want to use and recycle Genius Loci to summon the Sunavalon and Sunvine Link Monsters.  Its a pretty interesting Deck, and I really like to play it :)  &nbsp;  Im happy to hear any recommendations on how to improve the Deck and make it even better.  Last but not least: Can it be Meta Relevant? I think in this form no. Its pretty hard to play around / against some actual Meta decks, and in my Opinon, its more of an Fun / Casual Deck, who can <em>maybe</em> go Rouge. Anyway, leave a comment and stay healthy! :D"

","So, here's another deck that doesn't need (or want) the Eldlich engine, but i'm mashing the Eldlich engine into it anyway, because my parents didn't love me enough as a child. This is basically Eldlich beatdown with Sacred Beast beatdown, so they hit really hard and either A) End the game in one turn, or B) Die to mirror force. So basically just the egyptian gods but actually good cards lol. Wish the Wicked Gods got more support tho <span>Deck guide</span>  2x Hamon- SODO NO CHI SADAMEEEEEE- Me being a dumbass aside, here we have Hamon, one of the two Sacred Beasts we're running (Uria was excluded due to a lack of traps). Hamon isn't too hard to get out due to Cerulean Skyfire, Opening, Eldland, etc. Cerulean Skyfire makes it easier to get out by using facedown spells, so you can use useless shit like Black Awakening for it. Hamon, on field, is a fairly solid beater in attack position that can do an extra 1000 burn damage whenever it attacks, which helps with an OTK. In defense, only he can be targeted for an attack, which is fine for walling up. Skyfire regularly changes it's position for negations, so it's not too hard to get both position effects off. 2x Raviel- Raviel was originally fairly hard to get out, but now it's actually pretty easy to get out. You can cheat out Raviel with Beast, getting it out onto the field much easier than how it'd normally be. Raviel requires 3 fiends to get out, so if you don't cheat it out, you can shit out a good amount of Fiends with stuff like Chupacabra and Dark Beckoning Beast. While Raviel is on the field, when the opponent normal summons, he gets a token. Said Token can be tributed for Raviel to gain the attack of the token (1000) as long as it lives through the opponent's turn. Raviel's secondary effect is that he can tribute other monsters to gain their attack, so you can tribute smaller and more useless monsters to copy  their attack for an OTK. 2x Shimmering Scraper- Shimmering Scraper is a great card for more Raviel focused builds, which this is in some part. Shimmering Scraper can actually be summoned onto by tributing any 3 monsters to special summon him, making him just a 4k beater for whenever you need him, but that's not the intended usage. The intended usage is to discard it and target Raviel to double it's attack, which combined with Raviel's attack gaining effect, can go to 8000 plus. And in the grave, he can tribute a monster to bounce himself back to the hand, being easily recycable. 3x Dark Beckoning Beast- Dark Beckoning Beast searches out all the Sacred Beasts or one of the cards that specifically mention it (which there are a lot of) to fill in the gaps in your hand and supply whichever Sacred Beast you need at the time. It also gives you an extra normal summon off a fiend with 0 attack/defense (AKA chaos summoning beast), making him a great extender for a lot of plays. 3x Chaos Summoning Beast- Chaos Summoning Beasts helps get out all the Sacred Beasts you need, as the deck searches heavily, meaning you can get both Hamon and Raviel to hand. You can cheat out the one you struggle to get out legitametly (most likely Raviel) and then send continous spells to summon Hamon, making a strong board of beaters that you can rank into Gustav later. 2x Eldlich- Eldlich fucking beatdown. This is a mistake of an idea, but later. Like i've said before, you want to quickly get out Eldlich as fast as possible by using his effect on things like Cursed Eldland for it's search. Eldlich, on field, is a 25k beater (yes I said it) to contribute to the OTK, and the other cards that stun the opponent center around Eldlich. 3x Chupacabra- Chupacabra provides Fiend field presence, allowing you to get a good amount of Field's onto the board so you can get Raviel out how it's supposed to and cheat out the Joseph Joestar Headass. It's discard can be pretty risky, but as long as you get lucky you can dump some stuff you'd want in the grave into the grave (like the Golden Land stuff) for their effects, and get the draw. Although, Chupacabra's discard effect is useless, so. 3x Cerulean Skyfire- Cerulean has a host of solid effects for the deck, and Hamon.  It's first effect allows you to use face down spells (regardless of type) for Hamon's summon, which is great for using dead cards like Eldlixer. It's second effect allows you to negate any spell/trap the opponent activates and change your Hamon to defense, and this is amazing for being treated as a passive effect, meaning it can actually negate spell speed 4 stuff like super poly. And whenever one of the Beasts leaves the field, you take no damage for the rest of the turnt hey left, preventing you getting OTKed yourself. 3x Spirit Gates- Spirit Gates searches out all of the Sacred Beasts, or any of the smaller support monsters, giving you literally anything you need for your Sacred Beast plays. Additionally, Spirit Gates allows you to discard a card to special a Fiend with 0 attack/defense from grave, which is fantastic. Personally, I like getting a field of 3 fiends (Chaos, Beckoning, and Chupacabra most likely), and then sending them all off for Raviel.  Then you activate Spirit Gates to bring Chaos back and use it's effect to bring back Chaos, tributing Chaos to special out Hamon and have a huge board of Sacred Beasts. And, if you  control a Level 10 monster, you can bounce back a continuas spell from grave to hand, allowing you to recycle all the cards you sent away for Hamon. 3x Fallen Paradise- Fallen Paradise gives great protection to all of the Sacred Beasts, so you won't put resources into them and then have them be immediately destroyed. Fallen Paradise also gives you an amazing draw 2 as long as you control 1 of the sacred beasts, allowing you to extend your plays. 3x Cursed Eldland- Cursed Eldland, at  a miniscule life point cost, searches out Eldlich and the golden land traps, filling in the gaps of your hand. You mainly want to search Eldlich, and then summon Eldlich by sending Cursed Eldland for Cursed Eldland's effect. When Cursed Eldland leaves the field, it sends an Eldlich monster or a Golden Land card from your deck to the grave, allowing you a ton of good graveyard set up for more plays. 1x Eldlixer- Eldlixer helps with swarming the field with multiple Eldliches, for Eldlich Beatdown or to overlay into a Gustav. Additionally, you can banish Eldlixer from the grave to set a Golden Land trap directly from deck to S/T. The second effect is the one you want most, which is why you mainly want to send Eldlixer off of Cursed Eldland or something in that vein. 3x Awakening- Awakening is basically a one-sided Skill Drain, and is an amazing card. As long as you control 1 Sacrd Beast, you gain LP whenever your opponent summons, equal to the attack of the summoned monster. This effect isn't very major, as gaining life points sucks. 2 is where it gets great; As long as you control 2 Sacred Beasts, which you want to, you negate the effects of all face up monsters the opponent controls. This cripples most modern strategies and is a one-sided Skill Drain, being an amazing effect. I won't even mention the 3 effect, because it's impossible to get. 3x Scarlet Sanguine- Scarlet Sanguine also allows you to get out Eldlich, helping a fair amount with swarming with the Golden Boys. Sanguine also helps you easily get out tons more of the Golden Land traps, as you can banish it from the grave to set one directly from deck. While you can only activate one of these effects per turn, making it a bit slow, it's still a solid card. 2x Conquistador- Conquistador helps a lot with removing problem cards, as it gives non-targeting removal, which is very powerful in the modern game. Conquistador helps a lot with clearing boards to pave the way for an OTK, and is also just a body on field for a Knightmare or something.  He can also be banished to set Eldlixer traps directly from deck, which is great. And, like Sanguine, only one effect can be activated per turn. 2x Golden Land Forever!- Forever is a great source of negates and such, as this deck lacks many negates outside of Skyfire. It can negate literally anything by tributing an Eldlich, which is a great effect for making sure the opponent can't launch a comeback and you can finish them off, if you didn't end the game in turn 1. <span>The extra deck</span>  3x Gustav Max- Gustav Max is a great rank 10 XYZ, as it allows you to finish off games with ease. You can go into it easily with stuff like Eldlich, since they swarm the field so much, and any of the Sacred Beasts you don't need. Once you get your opponent to a low LP total, you can use Gustav to finish them off, or to bring them to the brink of death. It's also a generally solid 3k beater. 3x Almiraj- Almiraj is mainly just Extra deck filler, although you can go into it sometimes if you bricked or something. 3x Borrelsword- Borrelsword is generally a great beater, and fits a lot into the OTK play style. If you have any left over monsters, you  can go into a Borrelsword to clear the opponent's field and do huge amounts of damage. 3x Pheonix- Pheonix allows you to clear problem backrow with any left over monsters, in case your opponent has something annoying up that you need to get rid of. 3x Unicorn- Unicorn is great for non-destruction removal, which is great in the modern game. It can clear the opponent's field and make it easy for an OTK. <span>Playing Guide</span>  This deck is mainly a going second beatdown deck, which aims to close the game off in the first turn but has the Golden Land traps and such as insurance in case it doesn't. You want to lead off with activating Opening if you have it, to search and such, and also activating Fallen Paradise if you have it. Afterwards, you'll want to summon out Dark Beckoning alongside Chaos Beckoning. If you have a backrow that can manage 3 or more Continuous Spells, you'll want to tribute Chaos for Raviel, so you can get out Raviel easily and then get out Hamon legitametly. If you have Chupacabra in hand, you can summon it and get out 3 Fiends, to tribute for Raviel. Then you recycle Chaos with Opening, so you can get out Hamon illegitametly. Then, you'll have a field of both Sacred Beasts without much trouble. For the Eldlich, like normal, you'll want to activate Cursed Eldland to get Eldlich. Then, with Eldlich, you'll summon it by sending Eldland and then build up your backrow of strong Golden Land traps. From there, you want to mercillesly beat the shit out of the opponent.

The other Cyber Angel monsters have synergy with Benten whether it be using their effects by interacting with Cyber Angels in the graveyard or with Benten being able to search any Cyber Angel from the deck after being tributed, which is super easy with Drytrons. The main strategy is getting either Vrash, Izana or Dakini onto the field to cause some serious damage and if all else fails use the Extra Deck to summon strong monsters like Soldier of Chaos, Accesscode Talker, or Divine Arsenal AA Zeus.  This deck was built off of this decklist before I made some adjustments to it: https://ygoprodeck.com/drytrons-toolbox/  I recommend checking it out. I just thought I could make a more pure Cyber Angel deck with Drytron support since the Cyber Angels have some more synergy with each other."

This deck is really fun and can control the board easily. It even can OTK. I'd recommend some handtraps if possible but it works great without them. Malicious Bane is basically the Dragoon of this deck. He's a pain to deal with. Him and DarkLaw make a good combo to lock your opponent. Really fun to play with.

Flint Cragger  (Also, some criticism of this deck would be nice! It's my first Fossil deck, and I wanna make better","Fossil is an archetype I've been meaning to touch upon for a few months, but because I'm a lazy fool, it took me until almost Christmas 2020 to make a deck! For those of you who loved Nintendo's games, or have an autism-induced obsession with prehistoric life, this deck was named after the Fossil Fighters franchise. I actually got the first game when I was in my pre-teens, and I would play that crap for hours. HOURS spent digging up bones (and some fossilized droppings), cleaning them, and just slapping together teams of superpowered dinos. I also got Fossil Fighters: Champions, which was also a great game I got hooked on!  &nbsp;  Anyways, this Fossil deck also uses a small Adamancipator engine, and for good reason. One of Fossil's newest support cards was Flint Cragger, which lets you discard a card and send one of their Fusion monsters from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard. And because most of them have Graveyard effects that either add cards to your hand or pop your opponent's card, losing that card in your hand isn't a big deal. So Flint Cragger works amazingly with the ""Adamancipator"" Tuners, since they can summon Rock non-Tuners from your deck.  &nbsp;  Because Fossil is basically the Rock equivalent of Cyber Dragons, this deck has to go second every single time. With 9 hand traps, 2 Lightning Storm, and Harpie's Feather Duster, stopping your opponent from making any significant plays is top priority. Then on your turn, your goal is to try and get Fossil Fusion to your hand and OTK your opponent! And because Konami is too stupid to ban Halqifibrax, you can use Cross-Sheep to link climb into it, then use Halq's effect to go into Selene, and finally Accesscode Talker.  &nbsp;  But if you need to go first, there is some hope for you. Due to Halq and Cross-Sheep making great extenders, you can use them going first to put two Link 2s on board, and use them to make Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. But because the Extra Deck is so tight, I couldn't put Masquerena in there. Ugh..."

This is an updated version of my old build that I uploaded last week. The combo for the last build was a 3 card combo and was very conditional, but I have updated it into a 1.5 card combo! Dragon Link is not going anywhere anytime soon! It even ends on the same end board as the last combo! This new combo requires any of the starters and any of the extenders or Rokket Tracer in hand to achieve. I also made this build having 2 main goals - to minimize bricks and to make it consistent. This is my favorite deck of all time alongside thunder dragons (coincidentally also in this deck) and I have put a lot of effort into making the deck, combos, typing all this up and making my video so I really hope you enjoy it!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Full Combo = Starter + Extender or Rokket Tracer</b><span> </span>  <b>OR</b>  <b>Full combo = Romulus + Extender or Rokket Tracer</b>  &nbsp;  <b>Full combo results in</b><b> -</b>  &nbsp;  <b>Hand rip 1</b>  <b>Look at opponent’s extra deck and banish 1</b>  <b>Banish top card of opponent’s deck</b>  <b>Apollusa (2 negates)</b>  <b>True King of All Calamities (free win)</b>  &nbsp;  <span>It does not matter how you get to romulus, you just need to get to romulus, you can do it with all of the starters or you can even use 2 extenders or 1 extender and a normal summon to do so, it does not matter. If you can get to Romulus, you are good. There are many other ways to do the same combo, for example you can do starter + silverrokket or if you draw absorouter you can do it another way - the thing is if you can get romulus to the field and have 1 way to get another monster to the field, you have full combo. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>This is obviously post december 2020 banlist and since linkross, buster lock and smoke grenade got banned, this deck uses True King of all Calamities aka VFD as the main negate/win condition. This is a very consistent version of dragon link and you should be able to combo off very easily. To achieve this new combo I am utilizing the thunder dragons (dragondark and dragonroar). Dragonroar is not a brick it can be used with chaos space to achieve full combo (I show how to do this down below) but you NEVER want to see a dragondark in you hand EVER (No really drawing it is really bad).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you want to learn how to do this new 1.5 card dragon link combo, I recommend you watch my youtube video - In it I explain all my card choices and also show the combo. Please subscribe to the channel and like the video it is a great way to support me and the channel. Also be sure to answer the poll question down below! Today’s poll question is: Imagine you are entering a HUGE Yugioh tournament, what deck would you use?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmS1gtrr9ig</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Card choices</b><span>-</span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><span>Starters</span></td> <td><span>I am running 9 starters in this deck, 3 of all black metal dragon, chaos space (the best one) and Sefert. They are the cards that get your combo aka Romulus on your field and you will and want to see them in your hand all the time. If there is a case where you don’t see a starter in your hand, go into romulus using extenders! Getting any 2 dragons on the field = a starter and is a full combo! (with an extender or tracer)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Extenders</span></td> <td><span>I am running a lot of extenders since you will require them for the combo as well as to play through handtraps. The obvious ones are noctovision dragon, quick launch, world legacy gaurdragon and monster reborn. The not so obvious ones are - if your starter was black metal dragon then chaos space, white dragon and black dragon are extenders; if your starter was sefert then darkness metal dragon and chaos space (can search emperor) serve as extenders and if your starter was chaos space, darkness metal dragon and black metal dragon serve as extenders. Rokket tracer can be a replacement extender for the combo and also serves as an extender because it allows you to use Dragon Ravine to mill absorouter dragon and add another rokket to the hand so you can use boot and special summon 2 rokkets, and you don’t need an extra extender or it can even mill galactic spiral dragon which you can use to XYZ into Number 38 which is an extra negate!</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Handtraps and Removal</span></td> <td><span>I am running 3 ash blossom, 3 gamma and 3 Imperm for the handtraps. I chose these specifically for a variety of reasons. Ash is one of the best handtraps in the game and can counter just about everything. Gamma in my opinion is the best handtrap of this format because it can counter VDF, It can protect you from getting hit with an ash when you tribute sefert or when you activate chaos space, when you use quick launch and some other cases as well. It also serves as a way to turbo out savage as soon as striker dragon hits the grave so that your combo can be nibiru proof. I am also running imperm because it is a solid handtrap in general and also because it cannot be negated with stuff like called by the grave. For removal I am running 3 cosmic cyclone, it is a solid card and can wreck backrow and mystic mine players. It is also a great counter to Virtual World, one of the top tier meta decks of this format since it gets rid of the trap gate which results in no target for the virtual world monsters to special summon themselves.</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Only 3 Bricks! (Cards you don’t want to see in your hand)</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>There are only a few bricks in this deck. I count 3 real bricks. As I mentioned above, Thunder Dragondark is a brick, because you can’t do your combo if you draw it and it is a dead card in the hand. Another brick is PSY-frame Driver, but this is a brick I well worth playing because you need to to use gamma and gamma is the BEST handtrap in my opinion of this format. The last brick is Boot Sector Launch - it isn’t a dead card in hand or anything but you just don’t want to draw it because you are going to search it for free off of Striker dragon and nobody ashes a striker dragon (But there are always exceptions...). I have got this a lot saying absorouter dragon and galactic spiral dragon are bricks, here’s the thing - they are not, you can discard both of them from your hand and they are still useful and absorouter acts as an extra extender since it can special summon itself from the hand! Also drawing another rokket (not tracer) is also not that bad because you can summon itself and tracer from your hand for the combo, so you don’t need an extender! (That's why I said an extender or tracer because if you have tracer in hand you can mill absorouter using ravine add a rokket and then special summon both tracer and that rokket)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Going up against current meta and side deck choices </b><span>-</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The best meta decks of the format right now are Dinos, Virtual World, Zoodiac-Zeus, Drytron and just VFD in general. I have included counter measures in the main and side decks to deal with these. For dinos I am running 3 lancea to completely destroy them (are very dependent on banishing) and I am running 3 cosmic cyclone in the main deck to get rid of the lost world. To deal with Virtual world I am running 3 cosmic cyclone in the main deck to get rid of the traps gate they need to target to combo off and I am also running 3 Ice dragon’s Prison in the side deck to deal with the monsters they normal summon as targets for the Virtual World monsters. To deal with Zeus I am running the Dinowrestler and the Kaijus in the side deck. Finally to counter VFD I am running the gamma package in the main deck and I am also running forbidden droplet in the side deck (Kaiju and the Dinowrestler don’t counter VFD since its effect can be activated during the standby phase). I am also running a Harpie’s Feather Duster in the side deck to counter basically any backrow decks including Zoodiac and Eldlich. Nibiru is also in the side deck to counter basically any deck! You can main deck it if you want but I chose not to. If you really want you can also side Mask Of Restrict to counter Drytron, another meta contender. I have not been seeing too much Drytron so I decided to not side deck Mask of Restrict. Ice Dragon’s Prison, nibiru and ash blossom do a pretty good job dealing with Drytron and I wasn’t seeing too much Drytron so I figured that Mask of Restrict was not needed. You can side deck it if you are playing against a lot of Drytron, it is really your choice. You can side Dimensional Barrier to counter Drytron as well. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Changes you can make to the deck </b><span>- </span>  &nbsp;  <span>There are some changes you can definitely make to this deck, you don't have to but here are some things you can do! </span> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Include the dragoon package</b><span>- you are playing some extra bricks but you have extra deck space, you don’t need all the cards in there for the combo (you may want to play a 50 or 60 card deck if you want to include this)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Add in more thunder dragon cards and/or add in thunder dragon fusion and titan</b><span> - you can do this as well because in the combo after dragondark leaves the field you don’t search anything using its effect, you can utilize this opportunity to search something like Thunder dragon Fusion or Thunder Dragonhawk! (RIP Colossus we will remember you) I would go full 60 and add the dragoon package since verte can mill </span><span>red-eyes fusion </span><span>Thunder Dragon fusion and summon Titian and it can also mill red-eyes fusion and summon dragoon, it just works together better. You can even play 2 dragondark so drawing 1 won’t be the end of the world since you have another one in the main deck so you can do the combo</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Make it a 40 card deck</b><span> - you can cut the handtraps/removal cards and the extenders down to a lower size and make it a 40 card deck, I felt like for consistency I need to make it 50 but 40 cards are also great!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Make it a 60 card deck!</b><span> (If this is one of your choices I like the way you are thinking!) - you should add in more extenders and removal cards if you are making it a 60 card deck, I would also put in the Dragoon package if I was going full 60 since there is a lower chance of drawing those bricks. If you are afraid to play the slow game you can also add a second boot sector launch and/or a second absorouter since you have space, in this case boot won’t be a brick since you are going to get another one via striker dragon to the hand anyway. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Main nibiru</b><span> - the only reason I did not main Nibiru was because I was playing against dinos and Virtual World a lot and they both counter Nibiru very easily. Dinos use Miscell and Virtual World can make Number 75 before doing the VFD combo, it is your personal choice to do this or not.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Side deck Ghost reaper and winter cherries</b><span> - this is mainly to counter VFD and you can put it in if you wish, it does a great job against decks like virtual world, it can also get rid of dragoon if you choose to run it and it is also budget. It is an amazing pick because VFD is everywhere. You can also get rid of halq using reaper. The good thing about using reaper is that you will look at the opponent’s extra deck with Trish so you know what is in it, so depending on that you can add reaper from the side deck to the main deck depending on what the opponent is playing. I thought this was not needed but some people are even side decking zeus as a reaper target, this is ok if you have space. </span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <b>Budget alternatives - </b>  &nbsp;  <span>Not everyone can afford to buy every single card in this deck so I decided to throw in some budget alternatives as well. Dragon link is definitely not a budget deck but if you want to save some money here are some tips. The 1st one is handtraps, imperm is $30-40 and is not cheap, you can switch it out for anything cheaper - effect veiler is an awesome replacement and does the exact same thing. If you cannot afford ash blossom which is $7-8 a copy (maximum gold) you can replace it for something like ghost ogre. The handtrap you 100% need to play is gamma which is $1-2 a copy and is reasonably cheap. Gamma as I mentioned is the best handtrap of the format and you have to run it. Another non budget card I am running is Chaos Emperor Dragon which is $30-35 a copy - you could run like an extra lavineer but it is not the same since emperor is a +1 and it returns itself back to the bottom of the deck. Halq is another non budget card I am running which is about $30 a copy, sadly you have to get this card for this deck to work, there are no replacements. Forbidden droplet in the side deck can be replaced by Dark ruler no more but droplet is much better because it is quick play and counter VFD, dark ruler does the same thing except it is not quick play sadly. This is a little unfortunate and is all the more reason to run gamma. You can also put in ghost reaper and winter cherries as an alternative to get rid of VFD. You can also run the dragoon package if you have money, Dragoon’s price has gone down from $50 when it was released to $30 right now- of course it is not in this deck and is optional to add. You may be wondering why I only included these in the list, that’s because everything else is fairly cheap! Some that you may think are expensive are really not, you just need to buy the correct reprint. Some examples - </span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Apollusa ($3 maximum gold)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borrelsword ($3 maximum gold)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borreload savage ($7-8 Tin of lost memories)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Unchained abomination ($1 tin of lost memories)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Nibiru ($7-8 maximum gold)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Striker dragon ($2-3 Tin of lost memories)</span></li> </ol> <span> </span>  <b>Alternatives/Ratio change</b><span>-</span>  &nbsp;  <span>By alternatives what I mean is cards that you can put in if you are going for a larger deck or if you simply don’t like something in my deck or if you want to change up the ratios</span>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Starters <span>some alternative starters are Chamber Dragonmaid and Parlor Dragonmaid paired with Dragonmaid Hospitality and Dragonmaid Tidying. You can normal summon chamber, search hospitality, link into striker, activate hospitality, bring back chamber and go into romulus (full combo with extender/any rokket) or you can normal parlor, mill tidying, link into striker, banish tidying to bring back parlor, and then link into romulus</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Extenders <span>some other extenders include Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (Great paired up with chaos space and dragon shrine/foolish burial), Tempest the Dragon Ruler of Storms(can also be banished off of trishula to search crusadia draco and milled with dragon shrine to get itself back), Crusaida Draco (tempest can search), the Dragunity Phalynx/Dragunity lance package, unexpected dai paired with flamevell guard and galaxy serpent (this makes it so you don’t have to play the 1 rokket synchron, halq can just summon serpent/guard), dragon shrine, foolish burial, one for one, more absorouter dragons and so many more </span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Handtraps/Removal <span>You can play some alternatives for handtraps but please run gamma it is essential if you want to win. Some alternatives are nibiru, ghost ogre, veiler and even skull mister. For removal some alternatives are lightning storm, twin twisters and alpha the king of all beasts. You can also add knightmare Phoenix/knightmare unicorn replacing unchained abomination and/or heraldic seal - you don’t need those for the combos</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <b>Typical end board </b><span>- </span>  &nbsp;  <span>The typical end board should be VFD, Apollusa and a Number 38 and/or a Borreload Savage Dragon. But always, there are exceptions. If your board gets hit by a nibiru or something a typical endboard would be a Borreload Savage and/or number 38 at the very least and can also include something like a heraldic seal. The deck is good at comboing with less resources and is also good at setting up multiple negate boards including VDF which I also like to call a free win. When going second a well established board may include VFD, Apollusa and something to finish the opponent off like borrelsword dragon or unchained abomination. In general Dragon Link is a solid deck and can do a lot of amazing combos but everything comes down to practice and how well you know to play this deck! Practise makes perfect! But all I can say is the deck is not going anywhere anytime soon! </span>  &nbsp;  <b>How to combo if you draw Dragonroar (ss = Special Summon) </b><span>- </span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>activate chaos space, discard dragonroar, add white dragon </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Banish dragon roar to ss white dragon</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Dragonroar effect, ss dragondark from deck</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Go into striker dragon and romulus doing the combo like usual</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>After this you just do the same combo as the one in the video, just pretend the dragondark isn’t there and you can banish whatever you want with trish, if you are going full 60 you can banish tempest and add crusadia draco to your hand! This will be an extra extender you can use to go into savage/number 38 if you have spiral.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Final tips </b><span>-</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Some tips/mistakes I see a lot of players make while playing this deck. Put your negates in defense mode  - it is very important to put your negates in defense mode when possible (links are an exception) mainly cards like VFD, number 38 and Borreload savage, putting them in attack mode is a risk and if your opponent lightning storms you, you must waste that savage negate/number 38 negate and in the case of VFD, if you need to stall out a little longer you can even use its effect on the opponent’s next turn but if you get hit with lightning storm because VFD was in attack,  well you can’t do that anymore. There was a point when my savage dragon had 4500 attack but still I put it in defense because the negate is what matters, you can kill your opponent on the following turn. Another common mistake is people not making savage/apollusa as soon as possible - nibiru still beats this deck and it is important to make these before you get hit hard. For example as soon as you have something like gamma/driver I like to make a savage as soon as striker dragon hits the graveyard. Keep those in mind while playing this deck!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Conclusion </b><b>- </b>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, if you want to learn how to do this new 1.5 card dragon link combo, I recommend you watch my youtube video - In it I explain all my card choices and it  shows the combo as well. Overall Dragon Link is still a solid deck and the Banlist changed very little of how good the deck is. It does change the combos and the endboard and all but it doesn't change how the deck is played overall. If you play this deck more and practise I am sure you will get better at playing this deck and you will start winning duels! Practise makes perfect. Let’s take Dragon Link to the next level! Hope you have fun playing and messing around with this deck!

One of their video series was on ""Journey to The West"", a 16th-century Diet Japanese (I refuse to call China by its real name; they know what they did) novel that focuses heavily on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Given how the Zoodiacs are based on the Diet Japanese Zodiac, and how the mythical El Dorado is located in South America below the Equator, ""Journey To The South"" is an appropriate name for the deck.  &nbsp;  For anyone who wants to watch the ""Journey To The West"" video series, feel free to click this link!  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61nuXrvqNgI&amp;list=PLDb22nlVXGgdg_NR_-GtTrMnbMVmtSSXa</a>  &nbsp;  If you want to check out Overly Sarcastic Productions' channel in general, click the link here! <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodbH5mUeF-m_BsNueRDjcw</a>  &nbsp;  While the deck does have a total of 9 hand traps (12 if the Side Deck is included), going first is ideal because of the numerous Traps in it. Due to how the Zoodiac Xyz monsters can be summoned, and Boarbow's ability to attack directly, going second can result in you summoning a 6-material AA-ZEUS without activating a single card. The side deck is full of ""go-second"" cards, in case you need to play a more aggressive version of Zoodiacs."

Hope Harbinger provides battle protection for Goliath while Azure Eyes tagged out from Spirit Dragon provides great effect protection. Timing is important for this as you want to tag out Spirit Dragon when Seals activates its special summon effect after it's been tributed, not when you uses it's bounce effect. Otherwise Goliath wont get protection.  Seyfert and Chaos Space are important as they get you your baby chaos dragons which are, more often than not, necessary. Your good extenders include Noctovision, White Rose and Draco as they're all free special summons. It's also very important to have the Stone of Legend specifically in the GY. Spiral Dragon and/or tempest usually come out at the end of your combo for your last rank 8 which should be Photon Lord most of the time."

Thanks to the Pantheism of the Monarchs and the other draw cards( Pot of Duality, Macicians Souls, True Draco Heritage, Card of Demise) its extremly consistent in doing this.  The deck is immune to almost every handtrap or floodgates(even V.F.D. and Vanities Ruler) and very well in the grind game, what makes it a perfect Anti-Meta strategy. Obviously you want to go first, but thanks to the True Draco Spells and Traps or cards like The Monarch Stormforth the deck does pretty well in breaking bords going 2nd, too.  Enjoy!"

Anyone who's read manga knows what NTR really means. As for why I called this deck ""Neo Tokyo Rave!"", it's because some of the Virtual World monsters have Japanese words in their name, such as ""hime"", ""roshi"", and ""kyubi."" Also, I know that this deck has a Diet Japanese theme, but I still do not forgive Ch*na for giving us the Coronavirus.  &nbsp;  *Sighs* Anyways, this deck uses a total of 9 hand traps, as well as 2 Lightning Storm and Harpie's Feather Duster. Despite this, the deck works beautifully going first, because it can easily end on a True King of All Calamities and a face-up Chuchi that can pop one of your opponent's cards. And if you don't have the necessary levels needed to summon Calamities--which for me personally was rare--Photon Strike Bounzer makes for an OK substitute.  &nbsp;  Actually, now that I think about it, NTR is an appropriate name for this deck, because it cucks your opponent out of playing the game."

Is it fun? No no no, we can't be having that.","Buster Blader is a decent normal summon engine that can make the fusion to lock your opponent out of the game with a VFD style effect when Buster Dragon is on the field, you can get both out easily with prologue. I decided to pair the deck with the non normal summon reliant Drytron which has proven itself to be one of the best decks of the new format.  The decks main goal is to normal summon buster whelp to search prologue and then use the drytron cards to combo off into herald plays, searching lancea, or just making the big fat boi draconids.  ruler is in there for the scenarios in which you don't find whelp and your just playing drytron.  The extra is just stuff to link off into on occasion and the buster package, along with nova and mechaba to respect Dogmatika.  some other cards worth considering would be cyber emergency for searching out drytrons, jack in the hand to find many cards easier (though this will kill you in a drytron mirror), any other ritual engine that interests you, a rank one package for zeus, where arf thou to search more stuff, or the other drytron ritual that is a feather duster on legs."

Card explanations below...  <strong>MAIN DECK</strong>  Gizmek Kaku - This card is pretty underrated imo, as the extra zone is used in 95% of opponents decks and this card gives you a free special summon and equip (which bypasses cards that cannot be destroyed. Don't run more than 2 copies as if your opponent for some reason doesn't use the extra deck then it is basically a dead card (but again, who doesn't in 2o20 yugioh?)  Radian (Kaiju) - Dark Kaiju + staple hand trap to remove tricky targets (Dragoon etc.)  Hexe Trude - Special Summoned with Golden Castle of Stromberg, gives you a free pop and can be searched from deck (normal summon).  Ash Blossom - 3 Copies NECESSARY in today's meta  Necroface - The most important part of this deck, as for longer duels (more than 4-5 turns with this deck) it recycles your entire deck. Can make for easy otk with Forbidden Chalice if you have a lot of cards removed (or your opponent does)  Gren Maju - OTK that has no protection so SAVE until board is wiped and you are sure your opponent has no attack stoppers  Eater of Millions - Free 1 attack protection per turn, easy special summon, removes from play difficult monsters. Sometimes if you have 30+ cards removed this can also be a great beatstick if you don't need to immediately remove opponents monster from play  Gizmek Orochi - Pesky, free 8 card banish, monster destruction, quick effect summon. Easily three copies  Dimension Shifter - If you cross your fingers and are able to draw this first turn, it completely shuts down opponents graveyard. I'm not sure if i'd run this in every era with this deck, but with graveyard effects being SO prevalent in the meta, you'll want to run this bad boy.  Dimensional Fissure - One per deck, must have for banished decks  Harpie's Feather Duster - Staple  Raigeki - Staple (can also be combo'd with Forbidden Chalice to block negate)  Cosmic Cyclone - Staple  Allure of Darkness - Great draw power + rarely have to worry about not having dark monsters in this deck  Golden Castle of Stromberg - Perfect for this deck; it has battle protection, free 10 card banish, and allows you to search Hexe Trude from deck  Pot of Desires - Also perfect for this deck; staple  Macro Cosmos - Staple in banished decks  D.D. Dynamite - Was hesitant to run this for a while but it is REALLY helpful. 10 cards in opponents banished zone (pot of desires, dimensional shifter, necroface banish effect etc.) gives you 3000 free damage, and when your opponent manages to build a strong board but you just need a little extra damage to finish off the game, this is the way to go. Can also be combo'd with soul release but imo dimension shifter is better.  Evenly Matched - Staple  Dogmatika Punishment - Staple + Combo with Elder Entity N'tss for 2 pops  &nbsp;  <strong>SIDE DECK</strong>  Galaxy Eyes Cipher Dragon - Combo for blade dragon  Galaxy Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon - Good mp2 usage, can give you 3 pops and a special summon when destroyed to go BACK into another copy. Has helped me completely shut down opponent boards.  Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Can go into with either galaxy eyes dragon for easy board control  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Must have w/super poly  Elder Entity N'tss - Combo with Dogmatika Punishment for an extra pop  &nbsp;  <strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>  Nibiru - Staple  Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay - KILLER for link focused decks and also have built in negate. The only reason I don't run it in main deck is because if the opponent doesn't use link monsters, it's a dead card.  System Down - Cyber Dragon killer  Super Poly - Staple  Twin Twisters - Mystic Mine + Eldlich killer (staple)  Cosmic Cyclone - Staple  &nbsp;"

The idea of this deck is to draw as many cards as possible. The main idea is to get as many cards in the graveyard as possible and get to one of your Beginning of the End. This is accomplished first through overlaying for Coach King Giantrainer and Dugares. If this cannot be accomplished, there are backup options to getting to a Beginning of the End through Curious and Saryuja. There several end boards which can give you a successful board lock going first. You want some sort of combination of Apollousa, Dweller, Hope Harbinger, Vanity's Ruler, Dingirsu, and Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon (equipped with Dragon's Bind). If all else fails, slap down Bagooska.  Two Dingirsus allows you to several things. First, you can possibly play it turn one and turn two. Second, if you get into a grind game, it is nice to have a second Dingirsu send effect. Third, it allows you to go into Pain Gainer, which has an effect similar to raigeki. After you use Pain Gainer, you can go into Sevens Sins, the beefiest spider of them all. If you haven't used Dugares, you can use his other effect to double Seven Sins attack to 8000.  You can also play offense with Black Luster Soldier and Accesscode Talker."

Introduction</b></span></span>  <span><span>Before I get started I’d like to take a sec to plug my discord server The Yu-Gi-Oh Writer’s Guild. We’re a community of Yu-Gi-Oh players and content creators who host regular events and offer feedback on your lists or guides. We have a Tag-Duel Tourney coming up soon as well as more events coming early next year. If any of this interests you I’ll leave a link to the server <a>here</a>. </span></span>  <span><span>It’s been a while since I released a guide as my larger projects are taking substantial time to complete and maintain. Due to this I decided to try a shorter format guide to share lists I’m working on or playing in events that don’t fit my normal <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-oct-17th-build-for-ycs-10/"">style of guide</a>. This guide format will focus more on the decks core lines and follow-up plays along with any observations I’ve made during testing or play. All that said we’ll begin this series with with my current ranked deck Zoodiac Eldlich. On its own Zoodiac has had a storied history of meta play leading to a ban on both Zoodiac Drident and Broadbull on the September 2017 banlist. Zoodiac Drident was released to one earlier this year and this along with the recent release of Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus Sky Thunder has propelled Zoodiac to Tier 1 again. Eldlich was likewise released earlier this year and in a similar arc to Zoodiac has featured in various decks between Tiers 1-3 since. The combination of the 2 has been spotted in top-cuts throughout 2020 although I was first exposed to it via Kyle Lemieux`s<a> top 16 list </a>from PPG Weekend #4. My list features the standard line-up of Zoodiac monsters and a somewhat conservative Eldlich package to make room for tech choice such as the Artifact Scythe package and Imperial order. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2. Combo Guide</b></span></span>  <span><span>A quick primer before I begin our look at the deck’s combos and follow-ups I’ve chosen these particular lines due to their frequency in my time with the deck. As with my other guides I’ll try to explain a variety of follow-up options for the hands however I always encourage ones own testing with any deck to fully understand the deck’s lines. </span></span>  <span><span><b>1) Any 1 Zoodiac Monster</b></span></span>  <span><span>The first line we’ll be looking at is the deck’s most basic line for going first or second as it only requires one card. We begin by normal summoning our Zoodiac monster, for the purpose of this I’ll use Thoroughblade as an example. From there you’ll want to resolve any productive on-summon effects before overlaying Thoroughblade for Zoodiac Hammerkong. Your next choice depends on if you’re on the play or draw: if you’re on the play you’ll overlay Hammerkong into Zoodiac Drident, whereas if you’re on the draw you’ll want to overlay into Zoodiac Boarbow. Drident will give you at least a pop going first, if not more depending on which Zoodiac monsters are attached to her and what else you opened. On the other hand Zoodiac Boarbow enables Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder going second as potentially an OTK that turn depending on what else you opened. Conveniently AA-Zeus is also a suitable follow-up if you overlay an additional couple Zoodiac XYZ’s monsters during the line. Both of these lines are independently powerful as well as an excellent compliment to other forms of interaction like Imperial Order or Artifact Sanctum. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2) </b> <b>Zoodiac Ratpier</b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up is the staple combo of 2020 Zoodiac decks: The Megaclops Combo. For those unaware Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops is an enormous link 3 requiring 3 XYZs monsters to summon, a trivial task for this list. While there are a number of lines that can end on Megaclops I’ve chosen to cover the most direct line. Starting from the summon of Zoodiac Ratpier we activate its effect to Foolish Zoodiac Ramram before overlaying into Zoodiac Hammerkong and Zoodiac Chakanine respectively. From there you’ll want to detach Hammerkong for Chakanine’s effect to summon Ramram from the graveyard before overlaying Chakanine into Zoodiac Drident. We then use Drident’s effect to destroy Ramram by detaching Chakanine before re-summoning Chakanine with Ramram’s graveyard effect. To finish the line all we have to do is overlay Zoodiac Drident into Zoodiac Tigermortar and use her effect (ideally by detaching Drident itself for extra set-up) to attach Ramram to Chakanine in order to fire her effect again to summon Hammerkong. Finally we’ll link all 3 XYZs into the titular Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops. On its own it represents a large and mostly immovable body however combined with any other interaction such as our Eldlich engine or Handtraps, Megaclops can spell a quick defeat for your opponent. </span></span>  <span><span><b>3) Cursed Eldland + Any Eldlich Spell/Trap + Zoodiac Ratpier</b></span></span>  <span><span>The final line we'll be covering today is a hybrid, based on average end boards of both halves of the deck. To start we first normal summon Zoodiac Ratpier before activating its effect to foolish Zoodiac Ramram. From there we'll overlay into Zoodiacs Hammerkong and Chakanine before activating Chakanine's effect by detaching Hammerkong to summon Hammerkong from the graveyard. It's at this point that the Eldlich portion of the deck comes into play with Cursed Eldland. Use it search Eldlich the Golden Lord before discarding your Eldlich Spell/Trap of choice to send Cursed Eldland to the graveyard. From there we trigger it's effect to Foolish another relevant Edlich card, in this case I'll use Haquero of the Golden Land as an example. Next we set our Eldlich Spell/Trap and pop it so activate Eldlich the Golden Lord's resurrection effect. From here we can close the Eldlich half of the line by activating the grave effects of both Eldlich Spell/Traps we Foolished during the preceding plays. Finally to finish we'll overlay Zoodiac Chakanine into Zoodiac Tigermortar. We then use her effect to attach Zoodiac Ramram to Hammerkong before overlaying Chakanine into Zoodiac Drident. All together this board will optimally leave you with 2 pops and pseudo-Towers in the form of Eldlich the Golden Lord and Zoodiac Hammerkong, plus any other applicable interaction one opens.</span></span>  <span><span><b>3. Final Thoughts</b></span></span>  <span><span>At the end of this guide I'd just like to thank everyone for reading this! Let me know what you think of the new format in the comments below or my server, link <a>here</a>.</span></span>  As the meta continues to evolve post the December 2020 Banlist one can expect a variety of changes to established strategies as well as a few newcomers in the form of decks like Draitron. However Zoodiac Eldlich seems to be evergreen in the current meta just as it has been all year. The deck’s power was raised somewhat with the addition of AA-Zeus but at its dual-archetype core the deck's lines are mostly unchanged from earlier builds. I've really enjoyed my time with the deck despite a lack of any meaningful competitive data due to its sheer versatility across a variety of openings. If I had to pick on one weakness of this build it would be its reliance on the normal summon sticking on the first turn in order to execute its powerful extradeck plays. One could perhaps remedy this with the addition of a card like Triple Tactics Talent although I don't think that will help versus more control oriented strategies. Overall Zoodiac Eldlich is a solid deck with some interesting interaction and several powerful pay-offs but is limited due to its reliance on the normal summon."

My ratio's for a few different cards aren't 100% decided, but so far it's performing pretty nicely. A couple of the one-of spells are in there just as backups, depending on if I bricked. Called By still comes in handy sometimes. Foolish Burial Goods to send one of my eldlich spells, to get the banish effect. Memories of hope, to get a free draw 4 (assuming it goes through). Right now Lightning Storm is sided because I haven't decided whether I can make use of main decking it. But generally this deck likes to go second. It can go first, it just won't be as strong, depending on what you draw. If I go turn 2, I love sending Eldlich to grave to bump to the grave opponents boss monster that they ended on, or spell or trap. Then the board is still free for me to start the Numeron engine. I love rogue decks the most, even if they aren't the best, and having fun is most important to me, so try it out if you're interested."

But now that Tri-Brigade Kit and Bearbloom are a thing, I finally got around to making a deck profile. That lead me to making this masterpiece. I call it ""Tri-Brigade Mirko the Lapin Legend"", after <strong><em>My Hero Academia's</em></strong> best waifu, Mirko the Rabbit Hero(""Lapin"" is another word for ""Rabbit"")!  It does make sense considering that the majority of the monsters are humanoid animals, and that almost all of the monsters are animalistic in general.  &nbsp;  As for the deck's strategy, it can do well going first or second. First because the deck can either end on a Tri-Brigade Revolt or the Apex Avian/Thunderbird infinite negates loop. Second because the deck uses 9 hand traps, 2 Lightning Storm, and Harpie's Feather Duster. Cockadoodledoo is mainly there to go into Halqifibrax and link climb into Accesscode Talker if going second. As for the side deck, it uses 12 cards that can be used in the meta, and 3 Reborn Tengu because its floating effect makes it a good extender for Tri-Brigade."

Not only they have nice artwork, they also have great effects. The Albaz ritual sees and chips your opponent extra deck, while the Stigma fusion summons more fusion and able to float during the end phase. If combo fails, we simply play Dogmatika anyway lol. Starter is Formud Skipper, so Cynet Mining and One for One make us have 7 starters. Combo is in the video above.  Pros: Fun combo deck with legit setup, Dogmatika themed.  Cons: Big bricks, weaker version of Dogmatika."

You then use Dakki's ability to summon her back and you will find you can Synchro again. Keep up this process until you get the Skeletal Mayakashi. Then use Yuki-Musume's ability to summon her back, then send Mezuki to the Graveyard. Mezuki can summon any Graveyard monster back by banishing himself. This means if your Mayakashi monsters are beaten, you can summon them right back. You can also use Card Destruction to get a new hand if you need to. Now for Eldlich... Use Scarlet Sanguine to summon Eldlich. If Eldlich is defeated, you can discard 1 Spell/Trap, then get Eldlich back and summon him stronger than ever! If Scarlet Sanguine is destroyed, use it's effect and set the Conquistador. Then if the Conquistador is defeated, you can get another Scarlet Sanguine.

For example if your play against a rouge deck like blue eyes, and they summon Chaos Max, then you should summon Draco Berserker of the Tenyi to destroy a monster then gain its attack, then attack over Chaos Max. Or if your going up against a deck that likes having cards in the grave you can summon Punishment Dragon, also he is a good reset if you have too many cards in the grave or banished. This build also helps with spot removal, having cards like Chaos Dragon Levianeer, Judgment Dragon, Archnemeses Eschatos, and Tornado Dragon. You can also lock your opponent out of special summoning after a board wipe with Archlord Krystia."

Okay, so Linkross is a big hit to the deck, basically losing a free extender out of the extra deck, and killing off MY pathways instead of normal (more successful?) Rokket players. HOWEVER, old paths are still possible, and many broken cards are still accessible to achieve the dream of comboing off to unbreakable boards.  I initially wanted to cut the deck back down to 40, but I found that wouldn't work with the number of cards I now considered essential. In the end, I settled on 49 cards - slightly bulkier than I could cut it to, but with good solid ratios and a reasonable amount of interaction for a combo deck.  In the second build, I increased the Red-Eyes engine. Having more bricks might seem bad, and Wyvern is not a good card, but since this combo path eats up cards and wants to end on Dragoon, I liked being able to add 2 cards to discard and potentially even one more to put back into the deck.  We still have all of our starters - 3 Seyfert, 3 Chaos Space, the Black and White Dragon, One for One , Black Metal Dragon, and REDM. That's 11 cards that either get you there, or get you there with another of your monsters, (over 1/5 of the 49 card deck) and Chaos Space is also a broken extender when you see it. The Rokket Package at this point is pretty standard, these are the essentials. One Brotaur still makes the cut to search your dragons, with Levianeer to search, but generally you almost always want to search your Black Metal Dragon. 1 each of Boot Sector Launch and Dragon Ravine, which are combo pieces and good cards, and 1 Divine Lance ance and 1 Dragunity Phalanx, for the option to make Needlefibre and generate value off of Plaguespreader Zombie, also just nice to have when you see Ravine. For extenders it is 3 Noctovision, which is straight busted, 3 Quick Launch which is honestly similarly busted, and 2 World Legacy Guardragon, alongside the 1 Monster Reborn. Quick Launch can actually start you, Noctovision extends you while drawing a free card, and World Legacy Guardragon can get you value in a grind game, or be popped by Tracer to preserve your field spell. The deck also plays through hand traps pretty well, since 2 dragons starts you nicely. Adding to this, the Dragoon Package is also in here. The idea was to be the 2019 Rokket deck, except with all the modern bells and whistles. Dragoon can be an insane back-up boss monster, in case you don't see enough extenders, or can help you end on the five negate board (which is still a 2 card combo even without Linkross, though you need a discard for Dragoon.) If you can trigger Black Metal Dragon multiple times in a turn, you can easily fuel the discard for this card. Lastly, for hand traps, I think 3 Ash Blossom and 3 Ghost Belle seems good for this current format, since both hit Virtual World and Eldlich reasonably well, while being generally useful interactive cards in a lot of other matchups, and then I took some backrow removal main, since it seems really good right now with Zoo and Eldlich playing together, as well as all of the Traps being worked into modern archetypes, including Virtual World. Traps are good right now, so I'm assuming hosing traps is good right now. Cosmic seems the spell of choice in the format, sensible with Eldlich and Virtual World both having GY effects on their traps.  I always like to bring Hand Traps in the side, so for this side I chose 3 Nibiru. These could honestly be main deckable, but it feels like people are prepared for it now, and modern combos are resilient enough that Nib often isn't enough anymore. Nonetheless, sometimes I'll need more hand traps, and Nib is the best bet that isn't Gamma (I just don't have room for the Driver). I also have 3 Lancea, which I like against Virtual World, and which works with the Dagda package in the extra deck. DRNM is our going second board breaking card - the deck has some board breaking and OTK potential, especially with Borrelsword Dragon still being relevant in this particular deck (sees some other niche play, but not much). Still, we're a going first combo deck, so some free ""I win"" cards in certain matchups are probably a good idea. We've got 2 Lightning Storm and a Harpie's Feather Duster for backrow, adding to the Cosmic pressure when going second - these are also helpful in breaking boards, but being flexible means I can slot these in the Spell/Trap removal slot while also breaking boards sometimes. D.D.G is our going first ""skip your turn"" flex cards - if you know you're going first, you can cheese out wins with these cards against most meta decks. These are more controlly cards, but I like having the option to play more control, particularly since we're now ending on slightly smaller boards of a few powerful negatey beatstickes. One of the main goals of the deck is to us up an opponent's negates and then make Dragoon to win.  Extra deck is every card needed to combo off into Savage + Abomination off of 1 card, plus Dragoon and Needlefibre, to generate as much easy value out of the extra deck as possible. There's also a Borrelsword Dragon in there to OTK going second, and Apollo, to set up even more negates going first.  Combos  Combo 1 - Seyfert, or any 2 Dragons on the field, including a level 4 or lower. This combo requires pitching 1 card as well.  1 - Summon Seyfert, eff, add Black Dragon  2 - Banish Seyfert, summon Black Dragon  3 - Link Black Dragon into Striker Dragon - chain links debateable, but add Boot Sector Launch and White Dragon  4 - Banish Black Dragon, summon White Dragon  5 - Link Striker + White Dragon into Romulus, add Dragon Ravine  6 - Dragon Ravine, discard 1, send Absorouter Dragon, add Tracer  7 - Boot Sector Launch, summon Tracer  8 - Tracer eff, destroy Boot Sector, summon Silverrokket (locked into DARKs out of the extra deck now)  9 - Link Silverrokket into Elpy, Tracer into Striker (momentarily locked into Dragons)  10 - Summon Black Metal Dragon (we are looking to abuse the everloving heck out of this thing not having a once per turn)  11 - Link Black Metal into Pisty, add Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon  12 - Banish Striker, summon REDM to the far corner.  13 - Pisty eff, summon Black Metal.  14 - REDM eff, summon Tracer  15 - Link Black Metal + Pisty into Quadborrel, add Red-Eyes Wyvern  16 - Link Pisty + Elpy into Dillingerous Dragon  17 - Quadborrel eff, targeting Dillingerous Dragon - end result is you summon back the Tracer, Siverrokket, and Dillingerous Dragon  18 - Make Borreload Savage  19 - Make Unchained Abomination  20 - Make Verte Anaconda  21 - Make Dragoon. Is this Red-Eyes?? ;)  22 - Abomination eff, pop Verte Anaconda. It has done its job  So, that's 3 discards total - 1 for Ravine that you can't get around in this route, 1 for Quadborrel that the combo fuels, and 1 for Dragoon on your opponent's turn. In exchange you get 2 omni-negates, one which destroys, and a thing that pops cards when your negate destroys and during the end phase (not to mention during the Battle Phase is something is beat over). However, with a single extender you can mitigate the first discard and make Apollousa before you summon Elpy, making the combo both more powerful and harder to interrupt. At its very peak the deck can simultaneously draw and search a lot of cards in its combos to fuel the great hunger it has for discards. Generally the deck can actually land on all 4 of the main monsters pretty easily - going first your goal in a lot of games is Apollo + Savage + Dragoon + A-Bomb. Going second you're trying to play through negates and break boards with Dragoon + Abomb, and/or OTK with Borrelsword Dragon.  Added a small Artifact package to the deck. I think Lancea is just good as a hand trap right now, particularly against Virtual World, and the deck can make Dagda easily through Needlefibre in its normal combos, or as an alternative to Dark Dragoon if you don't have a card to pitch, with Unchained Abomination helping trigger Dagda and the Scythe, particularly alongside a Rokket Tracer. This gives you something to do when you can make Needlefiber but can't extend underneath Apollousa to make Elpy, and serves as a Buster Lock alternative."

However, these are a few cards that I am thinking of adding to the deck since finding a copy of the Zombie Horde SD is quite hard to find since it has a variety of staples and generic zombie support that can help boost the deck a lot. So far this is a rough idea of what I planned to do with the deck and I wish to hear your guys feedback and suggestions of how I can improve the deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

There's a surprisingly high amount of synergy between the two strategies and opening with a couple of playmakers can lead to some absurdly good boards.  The primary plan is to go first and try to establish ABC-Dragon Buster and El Shaddoll Winda on turn 1. This puts the opponent in an extremely bad position to try and play from since Winda restricts the actions they can take each turn while ABC can clean up their much more manageable board. Any opening with Union Hangar and a Doll will allow this opening since you can turn your 2 ABC monsters into a Verte Anaconda and then copy a fusion spell and use Anaconda as the dark monster.  Going 2nd is still a fine place to be in. Shaddoll Fusion obviously shines here and we still have enough room to run the Shaddoll OTK combo along with potentially making Buster along the way.

This can be done by special summoning a monster then tribute for Satellite Cannon or use a Falchion Beta's effect to special summon Satellite Cannon from the graveyard to the field. When possible combo Satellite Cannon with Machine Duplication Factory to get your fleet out in one turn. Use Luminous Spark or Machine Conversion Factory to give Satellite Cannon as much permanent ATK as possible.  When Satellite Cannon is on the field, goad your target into attacking when it has little ATK then play Mirror Force, Rising Energy, or special summon Vic Viper T301 to boost the ATK enough and destroy 1 or more monsters on the field. If the Opponent is hesitant, use Battle Mania to force their hand. Limiter Removal should be used sparingly and only if its use can ensure certain victory, or in an emergency if you can summon Satellite Cannon from your Graveyard on your next turn.  The Side Deck offers A-Assault Core if you prefer to use union monsters to bolster Satellite Cannon and offer more protection, as well as Cyber Repair Plant, Seal of Orichalcos, and Threatening Roar as alternatives to recovery, bolster, and defensive tactics.  &nbsp;"

This version cut some of the weaker cards for more interaction. Eldlich Dogmatika is two-pronged control deck, that seeks to win by using trap cards and slow, recursive value engines to grind out value in the long game, and in my opinion is the best shell for Dogmatika.  The Dogmatika line-up is 10 cards, and none of this has changed. 3 Nadir Servant are starters that search your Dogmatika monsters (Ecclesia) by sending monsters from the extra deck to the graveyard. This is a really powerful effect, since you can send cards like Wind Pegasus, or Nt'ss to get free interaction off of your search. More often, you can send Titaniklad, making this card essentially an Ecclesia that searchs both Fleurdelis and Punishment, which is insane. Ecclessia is your starter that searches interaction - in this deck it is a Normal Summon, and while you do dip into the extra deck most of the space is devoted to sending, and I'd say most games when things are going well you don't make any extra deck plays at all. Fleurdelis is a non-targeting negate and a beat-stick, and the deck's main output for damage. Punishment, however, is straight broken - for the cost of locking yourself out of the extra deck on your next turn, you can send 1 card from the extra deck to the GY to pop 1 monster card on the field (with less ATK than the sent monster). With N'tss this is a 2 for 1, but this is also a recursive engine thanks to Titaniklad, which really helps improve the deck's already stellar grind game. 1 Shaddoll Schism is here, just as a Trap card you can add to your hand by sending Apkallone from the extra deck, and then discard 1. This means Nadir Servant now doubles as both a way to get Golden Lord binned, but also as fodder to resurrect him. This 1 brick is extremely profitable IMO.  For Eldlich, thing have changed. We're still on 3 Golden Lord, but despite Cursed Eldland being such a big card, I decided I needed interactive cards to help get the game slowed down more than the consistency boost and Eldlich combos. We're also down to 2 Hauquero and 0 White Eldlixer. Too many games the White Eldlixer was just a dead card, and while this does technically reduce the power of Eldlich combos, the deck still puts up interaction like a mother, and I'd rather focus on getting things into a grind game to capitalize on my grindy engines.  For interactive cards we're at 15 total. Book of Moon is the best negative 1 in the game, useful both for helping break boards and for stalling people in making them. I don't normally love this card, but I think it is good in Eldlich and I wanted a tech option that was a Spell/Trap. Cosmic Cyclone seems really good in the main right now, what with a lot of the top decks taking advantage of trap cards in some way, and with many of those trap cards having GY effects. Doesn't hurt against Mine either. Imperm + Ash + Nibiru is just a pretty standard hand trap line-up for the format - these are good generic traps that hit most of the format. Imperm seems a little weak against Virtual World, but it has some uses there, and being a trap means there are a lot of benefits to running it in this shell. Good hand traps are good.  Extra deck is exactly the same - a lot of things for us to send with Dogmatika cards, and a handful of ""greatest hits"" for when we DO have access to the extra deck.  &nbsp;"

However Scrap Dragon Turbo has never really been the meta so don't expect to compete on national levels with this deck profile, especially since it literally dies to any form of disruption. The strategy is to get out Scrap Dragon or Twin Dragon and recycle Scrap Chimera back to the hand using anothe Scrap's effect so you can easily replace the Dragon in case he dies. Atomic is only in here for being the ""biggest"" Scrap Dragon despite arguably being the worst if we are trying to break through a field. However he can easily mess with GY-setups which many decks are centered around nowadays. Scrap Factory and Shark in hand will usually result in a Twin Dragon and a Wyvern as well as whatever you can come up with using the other 3 cards. I won't guarantee the deck will perform greatly but I will guarantee a certain degree of fun while playing it which is the most important in my opinion and Scraps just feel so underappreciated except for Recycler who funnily enough has no real place in a pure-ish Scrap build due to him being the only machine that would be run in the deck. You can build the deck more around him but the consistency of the Scrap engine would suffer from that."

Everything else can get searched out through milling or by effects of Charge/Chaos Searcher or Omni when summoned. </strong>  Ideally to start out your play you want <strong>Raiden</strong> in your GY<em> (or another <strong>Lightsworn</strong>)</em>, <strong>Lumina</strong> on hand, 1 random card to discard <em>(<strong>Raiden</strong> if he isn't in Grave)</em>. You take out <strong>Raiden</strong>, mill 2, and synchro into <strong>Michael</strong> or <strong>F.A. Dawn</strong>. But if you can special summon another level 4, either synchro into <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> or XYZ <strong>Minerva</strong> as a starting play.  <strong>Chaos Space</strong> helps a lot getting rid of dead <strong><em>Chaos Monsters</em></strong> or <strong><em>Wulf/Felis</em></strong> on your hand and get another Chaos monster into your hand that can't be a normal summon. I would suggest going for <strong>Chaos Valkyra</strong>, or <strong>Black Dragon/White Dragon</strong> depending on what you are discarding. <em>If you <strong>banish one light or dark monster</strong> that <strong>can't be normal summon</strong> from your grave while<strong> Chaos Space is in Grave</strong>, you can <strong>banish Chaos Space</strong> shuffle that monster back into your deck, and draw 1 card.</em> This way you can recycle certain Lightsworns (<strong>Wulf/Felis</strong>), <strong>JD</strong>, or <strong>your chaos monsters</strong>. <strong>Chaos Valkyra</strong> is an absolutely amazing card in this deck, it can be special summoned easily, and when she is banished, she works like a <strong><em>Foolish Burial</em></strong> but <em>it will negate its effects for the rest of the turn</em>. However, if you need a certain monster in the grave, she is still good!  You don't need to run multiple copies of <strong>JD</strong> anymore, 1 is good enough. The majority of the time you don't need <strong>JD</strong> around to win games but having <strong>JD</strong> is helpful. <em>I won many games without <strong>JD</strong> and even side <strong>JD</strong> out</em>. Your extra deck and your other boss monsters can win you games. Take full advantage of <strong>Trisula</strong> (both versions of the LVL 9 and the upcoming level 11 version) because it will help you clear the field by banishing problem cards and do some hand control on your opponent. <blockquote><div>One of the biggest problems with this deck is drawing into <strong>Wulf, Felis, </strong>or <strong>Chaos monsters</strong> while you have nothing in your GY or ways to get rid of them. It does happen but it is something Lightsworn players pray it won't happen, ideally, you want something to normal to summon at least like <strong>Raiden</strong> (especially), <strong>Lumina</strong>, <strong>Lyla</strong>, <strong>Twilightsworns </strong>or <em>anything that can be Normal Summoned</em> as a worst-case scenario.</div></blockquote> The main reason why I decided to main <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead of<strong> Effect Veiler</strong> or <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> is that you want to be able to take out problematic cards early on instead of just negating it so your opponent either has to waste resources or couldn't do certain combo plays or they still have the problematic card still around to use in their turn. <em>For example, if someone has out <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong>, out on the field, you still have to waste resources to get rid of a 3k beatstick if you didn't draw good/screwed up in your combo plays</em>. Also, it is an LVL 3 light tuner that can be used for XYZ or Synchro plays or used for banishing for light materials in the grave/used for discard for <strong>Chaos Searcher</strong>.  <strong>Omni Dragon Brotaur</strong> is such a helpful card, even though it is LVL 1, you can easily have link monsters that require LVL 1 monster as material in extra, or used for other Synchro/Link plays. <strong><em>It can Special Summon itself from the grave</em></strong>, help you get rid of dead cards from hand, and get out a search for a dragon type or a different type of monster on the field to hand.  <em><strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer </strong>and <strong>Chaos Emperor</strong> are fine running at one. However, I do recommend running multiple <strong>Chaos Creators</strong> because there is a lot of plays and combos you can do with it.</em>  <em><strong>Twilightsworn Lumina, Lyla,</strong> and <strong>Ryko</strong> are the three best <strong>Twilightsworns</strong></em>, they are also darks that can be banished for Chaos summons and search targets for <strong>Charge of The Light Brigade</strong>. I run 1 <strong>Lyla </strong>and 1 <strong>Twilightsworn Lyla </strong>because they are okay normal summons if you don't have anything else, pop a backrow for those decks that do run and help with mills. I tun 1 <strong>Twilightsworn Ryko </strong>because it helps to get rid of problematic cards on-field by banishing. I run 2 <strong>Twilightsworn Lumina </strong>because you will banish a lot, or your opponent will banish one of your L<strong>ightsworns,</strong> and she one of your few ways to retrieve them back.  For Extra Deck,  You only need 1 <strong>Minerva</strong>, I hardly go into her after starting plays. She an amazing at 1st and 2nd turn (if she survives) and a field nuke when need to crash into problematic monsters on the field <em>(usually most duel goes up to 5 turns before it is game over if no 1st turn OTKs)</em>. You can easily recycle her if you need it with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> or <strong>Chaos Creator</strong> <em>(she won't have material but if you need to crash and need the mills)</em>. If you are going turn 1, I would also suggest going for <strong>F.A. Dawn</strong> 1st if you can because negativing spells/traps are more important, you should go for <strong>Michael</strong> to get rid of problematic monsters or cards on the field. <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> does 2 things for you, mill and get whatever monster you need to your hand. <strong>PSY-Framelord</strong> is the best troll in the deck and helps recycle cards when needed. LVL 9 <strong>Trishula</strong> and LVL 11 one (coming out with the Ice Barrier Structure deck) are some of the best Synchros to go into. LVL 11 <strong>Trishula</strong> has a floating effect that <em>gets out <strong>Trishula LVL 9</strong> (though effects are negated it comes out as a 3300 beatstick), Skill Drains your opponent monsters currently on the field and cuts their atk in half when it destroyed.</em>  <strong>Number 38</strong> is something you would easily go into a lot, as you aren't main-ing key backrow removers like <strong>MST/Twister</strong> you want to be able to <strong>negative a spell/trap</strong> here and there, and also it protects your weaker monsters when needed. <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> is a <strong>meta call.</strong> You can run <strong>Leviair</strong> because you are going to banish a lot of monsters on both your side and your opponents. But the main reason why I decided to not run it because <strong>Chaos Creator </strong>a better <strong>Leviair</strong><strong> </strong>and I decided to tech-in <strong>I:P Maskerena.</strong>  <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> help with getting rid of backrow and <strong>Unicorn</strong> can help with getting rid of backrow or monsters by shuffling them back into the deck, they are stable Link with little explaining needed. <strong>Curious</strong> is an okay Link monster to get out, gives you a mill, a foolish but most importantly, <em><strong>you can get any card from your grave to your hand if your opponent destroys it</strong></em>. <strong>Saryuja</strong> and <strong>Bow of the Goddess</strong> are necessary Link-4s to have. <strong>I:P Maskerena </strong>is a good turn on if you need to go into <strong>Knightmares </strong>or <strong>Bow of the Goddess </strong>during your opponent's turn as a way to disturb their plays.  Side Deck;  Your side deck should be against whatever the current meta/or stuff your opponents can side against you or you know they have certain cards that can ruin your plays such as <strong>Macro/Skill Drain</strong> etc. But at the same time, you want to make your opponent's back row hates be dead as possible a the majority of cards I am running in my side deck are almost all hand traps. Except 2, Called by the Grave and Harpie's Feather Duster. Although I also suggest looking into <em><strong>D.D. Crows, Prohibition, Goddess Skuld's Oracle, Twister/MST, Lost Wind (you can activate from the grave), Breakthrough Skill (you can activate from the grave), and Phantom Knights' Fog Blade.</strong></em>"

Secret village will either shut your Opp. from using spells that turn (unless Eldlich) or force them to NS a spellcaster to which you can then use Haine's quick effect to pop said Spellcaster thus rendering them unable to use spells UNLESS they can react with a quick play spell. One way to get around this is setting WC Unveiling and immediately using it on your Opp.'s turn to SS any withcrafter from your hand, and with <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Witchcrafter_Unveiling"">Unveiling's</a> effect being used that turn, your Opp. can no longer react to Haine's pop effect since WC Unveiling states ""Special Summon 1 ""Witchcrafter"" monster from your hand, and if you do, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of your Spellcaster monster effects for the rest of this turn"".  Magicians' souls can help by being relatively easy to SS along with having draw power, or you can side in Jester Confit if you aren't comfortable sending a lvl 6 or higher Spellcaster to GY while also sacrificing ability to draw, but Souls is preferred since it can help send the WC traps to GY for their banish effects. In the event you are without a Spellcaster on field, WC Genni can help alleviate your spell restriction by banishing her along with a WC Spell that can help you get a Witchcrafter out. Don't like banishing? Well don't worry cause WC Patronus will help you bring back ANY Spellcaster Banished or in GY to your Deck or Extra Deck while also bringing a WC spell to your hand, which can definitely help against flood gates like Dimensional Fissure, but be warned because Extra Deck Spellcasters that were bainshed by Pot of Extravagance cannot be retrieved due to them being face-down.  Extra deck: <ul>  	<li>Magistus Artemis is only in here to easily send a  minor Witchcrafter to GY if you don't need to use their Field eff, but their GY eff is needed.</li>  	<li>Relinquished Anima can help clear your Opp.s' field but is reliant on having a Monster infront of the Extra Mon. space.</li>  	<li>Akashic can help bounce cards and can co-link with Magistus Artemis or Anima to mill one card from your deck.</li>  	<li>Day-break is mostly here just because he's a spellcaster, but he can help clear field as well if you can SS a Spellcaster to his zones.</li>  	<li>Selene is a little hard to get since this deck, and Witchcrafters in general, struggle with Monster Flooding.

For the last card in the main deck, we have <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Dancing Needle"">Magical Musket - Dancing Needle</a> which can banish 3 cards from any player's gy which is great because almost everyone is using gy effects. </span></h4> &nbsp;  <span>EXTRA DECK</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Ok, let’s start off with the boss card </span><span><a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> he is the key to this deck he generates your resources so you can keep negating your opponent and win the long game.

For anti draw power, we have <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> feel tired of your opponent searching and drawing out so many cards now they can only do one with this powerful card. For the second last monster, we have an extra <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.

For spell trap removal  I put in <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. For the only trap and last card, it’s <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> a powerful crap negate card making it so your opponent can not activate traps for the rest of the turn. </span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Deck strategy. </span>  <span> The strategy of this deck is to build up your board slowly while you stop your opponent from making theirs with spells and traps. This deck likes going second because you can break your opponent's board with kujus and use <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> to get you more spells/traps. Hopeful then your opponent has used lots of their resources already and 2-3 stuns will leave them helpless. This deck can force a slow game really easily with the kujus but if that doesn't work you have a side deck full of choices that can slow your opponent down and get you the win.  </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Decks to watch out for.

It's pretty similar to my previous deck posted here, primarily made for going second, however cards in the side deck maximise winning potential. The strategy is plain and simple, going second: break the opponent's board and swing for the KO. Going first: stun and set up a board wipe or lock the opponent out of summoning, before going in for the KO in turn 3.  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  Cyber Dragons:  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> - Run at three for the benefit of <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>, which remains the deck's win condition. Seeing this in the opening hand when going second isn't an issue given it's effect, however it can brick if going first and you have no other cards to assist in bringing it out.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> - The deck's main starter and MVP, ran at three. When summoned, this will, if uninterrupted by your opponent, will add 1 ""Cyber"" spell/trap to your hand. This card's secondary effect (activated in the GY) can also help reconstruct your board if your opponent has cleared your side of the field monsters, by bringing a Cyber Dragon monster from your deck to your hand at the cost of banishing Core from the Graveyard. Target #1 for Machine Duplication.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> - Again, ran at three as this is a Machine Duplication target. Both effects are useful, although you are far more likely to get mileage out of Herz mid-game when special summoned for Rank 5 XYZ plays. This card also synergises well with <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>, given Galaxy Soldier's special summoning condition of discarding a light monster, this card brings a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the hand to facilitate the special summon of the second Galaxy solider - instant XYZ summon into <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nachster"">Cyber Dragon Nachster</a> - Ran at two, as this is the only Machine Duplication target that can brick on turn 1; without another monster (preferably a Cyber Dragon) or Machine Duplication in hand, this is as good as useless. This card really shines when your GY is filled with Machine monsters with the magical 2100 ATK or DEF value, however be wary that once activated you can no longer special summon non-Machine monsters for the remainder of the turn.  <a data-name=""Cyber Eltanin"">Cyber Eltanin</a> - Board wipe, ""sends"" rather than destroys monsters and does not target, which is incredibly useful for dealing with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Searchable, used as an alternative and counter to the Red-Eyes package.  Other monsters:  <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> - A Cyber Dragon in all but name. This is the go-to card to make <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> as it leaves your ordinary Cyber Dragons available for other uses. Synergises with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> very well and is searchable through Cyber Repair Plant. In addition, if you have already summoned <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> and these remain floating in your deck (a brick waiting to be drawn), these are ideal cards to discard to grant Rampage the additional attacks. Ran at two, as three increases the likelihood that multiples could be drawn and bricking on turn 1.  <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> - Ideal for removing a troublesome opposing monster and is easily removable thanks to <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon (a good rule would be to run one Fortress for every Jizukiru in the Main deck)</a>. Searchable through <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>. Ran at one, however this is a very good candidate to increase to two.  <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> - Fantastic card to provide an easy bit of spot removal.  Handtraps:  <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Currently, I'm only running </a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">,</a> increased from two to three, as it's by far the most effective handtrap in the game.  I also considered the <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package, however I've found that with the other spells/traps/handtraps included in the deck, it's a bit overkill and can make the deck even more bricky.  <strong>Spells:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a> - The ROTA of the deck, with built in protection at the cost of a discard. Ran at three.  <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a> - An extender that relies on you having at least one ""Cyber Dragon"" in the GY. Searches the majority of the monsters in the Main Deck, however is a hard once per turn and given the prerequisite, I wouldn't advise increasing to three copies.  <a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a> - Another useful extender; <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for ""Cyber Dragon"" with the bonus option of allowing you to special summon a Cyber Dragon from the hand. Not particularly useful for your Extra Deck Monsters (barring <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>), however you have Nachster to bring them back from the GY. Could increase to two, however I prefer having a copy of Monster Reborn.  <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> - Your win condition. Target one ""Cyber Dragon"" with less than 500 ATK, special summons two Cyber Dragons from the deck. If this resolves, it's usually game over. Having this at three does make the deck very bricky, however given the risk/reward involved, the benefit outweighs the cost.  <a data-name=""Overload Fusion"">Overload Fusion</a> - Facilitates your OTK. Ran at one because having multiples in hand at the cost of an extender is not fun and Verte Anaconda provides an easily available search. The only target is <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>, however it's the only one you really need.  <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> - Quick play fusion card that also can facilitate an OTK, for the purpose of bringing out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> or Rampage. In terms of using it, this is best activated during the battle phase, after all other monsters have attacked, bring out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> for 5600 points of damage (better still when this is combined with Sieger).  <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> - Going second staple, Harpie's Feather Duster + Raigeki. Budget alternatives: <a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>  <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> - Going second, helps break boards by nullifying monster effects.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - Staple for seeding the GY and activating Repair Plant.  <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - Useful as an extender and to bring back boss monsters in a pinch.  <strong>Traps:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> - Great card. Maximum 3 cards popped on your opponent's side of the field and if destroyed by card-effect, you can search another ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your deck. I've added the second copy which is usually sided out into the main. Banishes Cyber Dragons to set up for Cyberload Fusion.  <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> - Wins you games!  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> - Useful to dispose of your Kaiju, and wiping the field clean in mirror matches or anything that uses a Machine type.  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> - Snatches opponent's monsters out of the Extra Monster Zone, what's not to love?  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> - Insanely powerful card. Has the potential to act as a Harpie's Feather Duster (depending on the number of monsters used for its Fusion Summon) and can attack three times. Ran at two as space is an issue in the Extra Deck.  <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> - More potent than <a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>, hands down. This card is a game winner if brought out with <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> during the battle phase.  Cyber Eternity Dragon - Generic Cyberload Fusion Target, 4000 DEF, if there's a Fusion monster in the GY it can't be targeted or be destroyed by card effect.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> - Ran at two, for safety, as everyone hates it when the smashy rock comes down!  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> - Best card to bring out when forced to go first (paired with Cybernetic Overflow). Can suck up an opposing monster and provides a negate.  <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> - One of the best XYZ themed cards in the Meta, synergises well with Infinity and Nova.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a> - Built in Limiter Removal, best used in conjunction with Chimeratech Rampage Dragon  <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> - Searches Overload Fusion and Cyberload Fusion!  <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> - Turns on Cyber Repair Plant and provides protection for Extra Deck Monsters  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> - Similarly to Almiraj, turns on Repair Plant, but is exclusively for Herz and Nachster  <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> - Makes an opponent pay for zone deployment mistakes and easily accessible via Herz and Nachster.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>:  <a data-name=""Heat Wave"">Heat Wave</a> - Cyber Dragon hates going first, however this card shuts down most decks by stopping Effect Monsters from being summoned until your next draw phase, giving you an opportunity to OTK on turn 3  <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - A particularly nasty way of clearing the opponent's board. It might stop you from OTKing on Turn 2, but it's definitely worth running at three! <span>Moved from the Main Deck to the side as I'm using Lightning Storm in the Main Deck.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a> - Self explanatory, removing an opponent's starters, extenders or combo pieces from their hand can ruin their day!</span>  <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> - Generic stun, a potential alternative is <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning. Sided in going first.</a>  <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - A gut punch of a card that I'm so glad is making a bit of a comeback. Sided in going first.  <strong>Other cards to consider:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a> - Suprisingly useful link-fodder and a helpful chain-blocker for Cyber Dragon Core. I've heard of people running this at more than one for these reasons, however if this was the sole monster in my hand on Turn 1, I'd be very disappointed. Given that this is also <em>not</em> a Machine Duplication target, I would not advise having more than two in the deck. <span>Removed from the Main Deck as whilst it's nice to have, using the slot over other cards wasn't justifiable.</span>  <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> - Easily accessible beatstick in the mid-late game, 3000 ATK is not to be sniffed at. The banishing summoning condition synergises with the deck very well and comes with a built in Monster Reborn-effect for additional link-fodder. As it is 8 stars, this also can be used as material for the XYZ summon of <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star (if played)</a>. This card can brick and therefore is ran at one.

You don't need to run tribute it makes it a lot more budget if you don't he allows for the 1 card combo but he's not necessary it's a good deck even without him. You can switch out the three real traps for hand traps and I prefer to keep the deck around 40-45 cards for constancy purposes so if you choose not to run tribute for budget reasons I suggest running handtraps like in my side or adding kaijus or even a feather duster if you have it for back row removal but that's what twin twist is there for or satellite falcon. I hope you have fun with it and let me know how you do by tagging @precisionxdualists or dm'ing us on instagram

(Also, am I the only one who gets gundam vibes from AA-ZEUS's artwork?)","  ...Alright so...here is my first Galaxy/Photon deck, revolving around Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon. I'm very much new to that archetype, in terms of playing it. Up until now, I've only played against it. Because of that, some advice on how to improve this deck would be GREATLY appreciated.  &nbsp;  Anyways, this deck's main goal is to go second because of Cipher Ex Dragon's first effect, which lets you detach two Xyz Materials from it to make your LIGHT monsters untargetable until the end of your opponent's turn. Basically, your strategy is to summon Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon (without using its effect), then summon Cipher Ex Dragon with it and use that effect. Then you attack with your Xyz monsters, and use Cipher Ex Dragon to summon AA-ZEUS during your Main Phase 2. And because AA-ZEUS is a LIGHT monster, your opponent can't target it with any card effects until their turn is over.  &nbsp;  The end result of this strategy is that your opponent will be left to deal with an untargetable, 3000 ATK beatstick that can nuke the field. And if Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon is detached to activate AA-ZEUS's effect, Afterglow Dragon can either use its second effect to attach a Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from the hand or Deck to ZEUS so that it can activate its effect again. Alternatively, Afterglow Dragon's effect can summon it to your field so that you can deal at least 6000 battle damage on your next turn.  &nbsp;  So, the Ace Monsters of this deck are Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon, Photon Dragon, Cipher Ex Dragon, and AA-ZEUS.  Because of this deck's primary goal, and AA-ZEUS's appearance, this deck is named ""Galaxy Gundam."""

This new deck that I made does not require the new trap gate to be nibiru proof, this new card is like the icing on the cake. It is very easy to achieve and here’s what you need to do it and what you get when you do it - </span>  &nbsp;  <b>What you need -</b>  &nbsp;  <b>Lulu/Lili + Kawaloon + any 1 VW monster except Nyannyan</b>  &nbsp;  <b>What you end on - </b>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>The entire thing is Nibiru proof (Gossip shadow)</b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">VFD (Free win - no monster effects on the field for opponent)</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Number 75: Gossip Shadow (negate if you haven’t used it already on nibiru)</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Geomathmech Final Sigma (great against control decks, OTK card for next turn, unaffected by other cards, is a 3k beat stick that does double damage while on the extra monster zone)</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Virtual world gate: Chuche (shuffle 2 VW cards from banish zone into deck to pop 1 during opponent’s turn)</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span>Virtual world is a Tier 1 competition of the current metagame and took - 1st LCS 8, 2nd LCS 8 and 1st LCS 9. The deck is very powerful being able to being able to turbo out True King of all Calamities very consistently, end on zeus with 4 materials at the worst case, be nibiru proof (number 75), Have multiple sources of removal (Utopia Beyond to counter Dragoon, Jaja, Break Sword, Constellar M7) and have a level 9 synchro monster on the field that if sent to the graveyard off of true king or simply just sent there - can recur itself back and is literally a Macros Cosmos (any card sent from the field to the graveyard is banished instead). This is all as of now and it gets better. There is new support of this deck that makes the deck more consistent and even better! The combos also end on a much higher note! The 2 new cards coming are Virtual world Rabbit - Tutu and Virtual World Gate - Zhuangwoo. Tutu is trash so this deck does not run it but Zhuangwoo is actually really good. You never really want to set it because it’s field effect is really bad. It is only good because of it’s monster reborn effect you can activate by banishing it from the graveyard. If you draw it you can simply discard it to resolve Qinglong so it is not a brick. It can extend the combo and also serve as an extender paired up with Foolish Burial goods! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you want to learn how to do this combo, I highly recommend watching my Youtube video - in it I explain the entire deck in-depth and all of my card choices and also tell you how to do the combo. In this video I only do the Nibiru proof combo so if you want to learn how to do the ‘normal’ combos as well check out my other video! I also have a 1st Place LCS 8 Virtual world deck video if you are interested in that. Also consider answering the poll question down below! Today’s poll question is: What are your favorite decks of all time, and what is your favorite archetype/card?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video (Nibiru proof combo) - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWhnwYCk0Uo&amp;t=1s</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video with the ‘normal’ combos- </span><a><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1BEmTULP4&amp;t=7s</span></a>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the 1st Place LCS 8 video -</span><a><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAPKAoKrm30</span></a>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks and I will see you next time! :D</span>  &nbsp;"

Originally, ""Gladiator Beasts"" were a battle-focussed archetype with a unique gimmick which is referred to as ""taging out"", in which a ""Gladiator Beast"" monster could shuffle itself into the deck after being part of a battle and summon another ""Gladiator Beast"" from the deck which would then activate some sort of effect. They still have this ability and work with it, but the more modern support also gave them ways to tag without even attempting a battle while providing the deck with various other cards and strategies to make use off.</p> <p>First and foremost, the Normal Monster in the archetype in form of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" is absolutely crucial. Unlike various other archetypes that have Normal Monsters in their ranks, ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" is a solid beater, can be used for various other summons in the deck and is a consistent Special Summon to use via ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"".</p> <p>The Effect ""Gladiator Beast"" Monsters I run are one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>"", both for the graveyard setup as well as her ability to change her level in order to be used for certain Fusion monsters, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiari"">Gladiator Beast Bestiari</a>"" for his backrow removal effect and because he is of paramount importance to summon ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"" from the Extra Deck, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a>"" for the very useful ability of recycling ""Gladiator Beast"" Spells, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a>"" for an in-archetypal ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a>"" for yet more graveyard setup, the effect of preventing one attack with the added bonus of being able to tag during the opposing turn, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a>"" as more high-level Fusion material that can Special Summon itself and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a>"" for yet more high-level monster for the Extra Deck summons with the added bonus of being able to swarming the field with ""Gladiator Beasts"" and also triggering their effects since they still get summoned correctly. The generic monster options aside from ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Test Tiger"">Test Tiger</a>"", which are more swarming and allow more hands you draw to go into ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for interruption that you can and should absolutely afford to play.</p> <p>The backrow has three ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"", three ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a>"" for various reasons but mostly as a play extender, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Proving Ground"">Gladiator Proving Ground</a>"" as the ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" for ""Gladiator Beasts"", one ""<a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>"" to clear monsters off the opposing field while also gaining material for ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" to make ""Gladiator Beast"" monster available again which allows you to activate cards like ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>"" again, one ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast United"">Gladiator Beast United</a>"" to surprise opponents during the Battle Phase by summoning monsters such as ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>"", three copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Rejection"">Gladiator Rejection</a>"" as a useful summoning tool and a way to give your monsters targeting protection, one ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Charge"">Gladiator Beast Charge</a>"" as a board clear, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a>"" as a searchable anti-monster effect Counter Trap and lastly one ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" for the well-known ""Utopia Double"" engine.</p> <p>In terms of the Extra Deck ""Gladiator Beasts"" actually use quite a lot of the options they have at their disposal. ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Essedarii"">Gladiator Beast Essedarii</a>"" is only in the Extra Deck to have access to another Level 5 ""Gladiator Beast"" monster if I have enough option in the Level 4 segment but cannot go any higher with the available cards. The aforementioned high-level ""Gladiator Beasts"" are absolutely necessary as you pretty much always want to summon ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>"", who pretty much summons Extra Deck monsters for free and therefore really pays for himself. Options to summon via ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>"" include ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>"" for as many Spell/Trap negates as you want as long as you can pay for it by discarding cards from your hand, or ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>"" who comes with 3500 ATK, can negate a monster effect per turn and lets you choose what the opponent has to attack. Equally as important in the Extra Deck is the aforementioned ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"", who gets rid of two opposing cards when summoned. Constantly resummoning ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>"" is something that is relatively easy in this deck and can clear the field while you are still setting up for an OTK scenario. The main play enabler is ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"", who is summonable with two monsters of which thankfully only one needs to be a ""Gladiator Beast"" monster, and it fetches ""Gladiator Beast"" cards on summon while also allowing to ""tag out"" without the need of an attack. The rest is pretty straightforward: I run the two cards necessary for the ""Utopia Double"" engine, one ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" since it supports the beatdown strategy really well, ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" against opposing backrow, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Dragases"">Gladiator Beast Dragases</a>"" for the rare scenarios in which he is a better choice than ""<a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>"" to make the best out of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a>"" in your starting hand.</p> <p>I only started writing about ""Gladiator Beasts"" after a friend of mine asked me to help him build a deck with them, but after I was finished going through them all I had to admit that they are an interesting bunch of cards to work with. I feel like they run out of resources rather quickly but they do perform quite well with some explosive plays while also staying true to their archetype's identity. If you want some more information on ""Gladiator Beast"", for example about the cards I left out in this 50+ card archetype, then feel free to take a look at my archetype analysis on my blog: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/12/19/archetype-analysis-gladiator-beast/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/12/19/archetype-analysis-gladiator-beast/</a>.</p>"

To achieve this, the aim on the first turn is to turbo out a Necrovalley and the main boss monster, Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, and then use Supernaturalist's effect to add Hidden Temples to your hand during the end phase. The rest of this deck is built around helping this combo achieve consistency and increasing special summoning power. Supernaturalist, when summoned, will usually have about 3200 attack, protects your Necrovalley from destruction which eliminates the need for Gravekeeper's Shaman, can search any Gravekeeper's and Necrovalley spell and trap, and is immune to destruction, making it hard to beat over when your opponent is locked out of special summoning. This deck avoids using the outdated flip effect Gravekeeper's, as they are too slow to compete in the modern meta. The rest of the summary will discuss the purpose of each card and its uses.  <strong>Main Deck Monsters:</strong>  <em>Gravekeeper's Spiritualist:</em> The deck's fusion card, which saves you from needing fusion spells. The goal is to add her and Necrovalley to your hand first turn with the deck's large amount of search power, summon her and use her and another Gravekeeper's in your hand as fusion material. The downsides are she must be on the field to use her, and is vulnerable to Effect Veiler and Impermanence. Also, you need a Necrovalley on the field first in order to fusion with her, but you can use Gravekeeper's Priestess in place of Necrovalley as well.  <em>Gravekeeper's Priestess: </em>These two are mainly here to increase the consistency of using Spiritualist's effect first turn. In case you can't get a Necrovalley, use her in place of it and special summon Spiritualist to use her fusion effect. The attack boost is not important, but sometimes helps.  <em>Gravekeeper's Headman: </em>When normal or special summoned can revive any level 4 Gravekeeper's, not negated by Necrovalley. Can use with Descendant to pop an opponent's card, Spiritualist to perform another fusion, or Commandant just as fusion or XYZ fodder or a beatstick. Use to extend combos basically.  <em>Gravekeeper's Descendant: </em>The deck's main form of spell/trap or monster removal. Requires a tribute, but you can turn this into a free monster search if you tribute Recruiter, which does not miss timing. It's important to note that this is not once per turn. Then works well for fusion and XYZ fodder.  <em>Gravekeeper's Recruiter: </em>When sent from the field to the graveyard in any way, gives you a free search of any other Gravekeeper's, of which you'd usually want to add Spiritualist. It's important to note that this card does not miss timing on any of the cards in this deck you could combo with it and isn't once per turn, so feel free to exploit it to your heart's content.  <em>Gravekeeper's Commandant</em>: A free unlimited Terraforming that can also double as a monster for any fusion or XYZ plays.  <em>Gravekeeper's Chief: </em>Works well with Transmodify when tributing any of your level 4 monsters, but when used in this way doesn't gain its tribute summon effect. When tribute summoned revives any of your Gravekeeper's in the graveyard, including Supernaturalist. He also negates the effect of Necrovalley for your graveyard only, letting you use Dark Magic Veil on any of your monsters in the graveyard. He has good, but very situational uses, which is why I have him at only one copy.  <em>Summoner Monk:</em> Is both dark and spellcaster, the same as Gravekeeper's monsters, letting this card benefit from Dark Magic Veil, Magician's Circle, and Transmodify. It's important effect, the special summon, is only a soft once per turn, so you can use multiple copies on the field, it works whether it is normal or special summoned, and can even search another copy of itself out if desired. You can discard a spell you don't need to special summon any level 4 from your deck, of which the best target for is most often Spiritualist to fusion summon Supernaturalist. You can also use this one card for a free XYZ summon of any rank four, as overlaying does not count as tributing the card. However, it cannot be used as fusion material for Supernaturalist. Overall a very versatile card in Gravekeeper's.  <strong>Extra Deck Monsters:</strong>  <em>Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist: </em>The main boss monster of the deck. When fusion summoned and with Necrovalley, has a minimum of 3200 attack. With Necrovalley on the field both Necrovalley and Supernaturalist are immune to destruction effects, which is why Gravekeeper's Shaman isn't included in this deck, as Supernaturalist does what she does but better. Its search effect happens during the end phase, but remember to activate it during your main phase. With it, you can search any Gravekeeper's or Necrovalley spell or trap. The goal is to get this card out first turn, and then search Hidden Temples of Necrovalley if you didn't hard draw it.  <em>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK: </em>Functions as a situational option for removing a problem monster without destroying it. Can then use that monster as material to save itself from destruction.  <em>Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer: </em>Similar to Silent Honor ARK, this card can bounce any face up card, including spells and traps, back into the deck. Is also here for its situational uses.  <em>Quintet Magician: </em>It should not be a goal of this deck to summon this card, but it's here as a very powerful situational option that can win the game on its own, if you happen to be able to go into it.  <strong>Spell Cards:</strong>  <em>Necrovalley</em>: The main spell card of the deck, used to make almost all its plays. The attack increase is good, but its main purposes are to enable your card effects such as Spiritualist and Hidden Temples, and to lock your opponent out of moving any cards any their graveyard while you retain full access to yours. You want this card in your hand first turn.  <em>Hidden Temples of Necrovalley</em>: The second most important spell card, this card locks both players out of all special summoning, except Gravekeeper's. Keep in mind this restricts you from XYZ summoning or special summoning Summoner Monk. Is a very good card to hard draw first turn, but is mainly added to the hand with Supernaturalist.  <em>Throne of Necrovalley:</em> Is a very good searcher for any Gravekeeper's, of which you could use it to add a Commandant to your hand to then use its effect to get a Necrovalley, search Spiritualist for a fusion summon, or even Headman or Chief for a special summon from the graveyard. Instead, can also be used for an extra normal summon of a Gravekeeper's to extend combo plays, making this the most versatile option in the deck.  <em>Dark Magic Veil: </em>Is an amazing special summon of any monster in this deck from your hand or graveyard, for barely any cost, and is not once per turn. Keep in mind however, that if you have Necrovalley on the field and don't have Chief on the field, you can only use this to special summon from the hand, but even then this card is still very useful.  <em>Transmodify: </em>Is very versatile in this deck, mainly to turn any level 3 on the field into any level 4 from the deck, as all monsters in this deck are the same type and attribute. You'd mostly want to summon Spiritualist with this card. Also works very well with Recruiter for a free search to turn its cost into a benefit, and does not miss timing. You could also use it on a level 4 to bring out Chief from the deck to use Dark Magic Veil on monsters in the graveyard. However, it is reliant on having a level 3 on the field, so I have it at two copies, but I could see someone wanting to play it at three.  <em>Terraforming: </em>Free search for Necrovalley. Is limited to one copy on the ban list.  <strong>Trap Cards:</strong>  <em>Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley: </em>A powerful omni-negate and destroy of any card effect, if you have Necrovalley and a Gravekeeper's on the field. However, as a trap card and with the limitations it has, it can be a bit slow, so feel free to slot in hand traps like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, or Infinite Impermanence if you want to, but this card is a cheap and still pretty good alternative to those.  <em>Magician's Circle: </em>A free special summon of literally any monster in your deck if a spellcaster on the field declares an attack. While this effect is almost broken, it can backfire if your opponent runs any spellcasters, so you could also side deck this card and run something like the hand traps listed above or another Transmodify if you want.  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Gravekeeper's are a good anti-meta deck that can go against even strong meta decks, but they are reliant on establishing their field before your opponent can, otherwise the swarm abilities and negates of meta decks will be too much to handle. However, this is a cheap and easy to play deck that is great for anyone looking to get into Yu-Gi-Oh and start winning games."

Since Graff and Cir were both released on the latest list, pot of desires is now a viable option for use within the deck. Using desires however limits the usefulness of trap trick, so I wanted to make a list that could still be considered as ""Trap BA"" while making use of the great draw card that is pot of desires.

Tri-Brigade is known for its spam ability but negas so hard that it can barely climb the top spot. With the new Bujin, it cover the negs while giving higher ceiling and recursion thanks to Torifune and Rescue Rabbit for easy Amaterasu that can summon/add from banished pile. The new Tri-Brigade link 2 Bearbloom further adds power to this deck, it searches Revolt that can summon Shuraig during opponent's turn for more interruption (Bujin makes the fodders possible, Revolt can summon Nervall as material for more recovery too). Combo is in the video, I will explain card by card.  Bujin: 3 Torifune, 2 Rescue Rabbit, 1 Unexpected Dai (3 Dai/Rabbit are too much as the Bujin only make Amaterasu pass, Torifune is better than other cus it searches Centipede/Quilin). 3 Hiruko (3 cus we run Rescue Rabbit/Dai). 1 Centipede (pops s/t from gy) and Quilin (bounce face-up card from gy) as Torifune target. 1 Amaterasu (ss during your turn, add during your opponent's turn) and Susanowo (searches Hiruko to make Amaterasu). <strong>We dont run other Bujin as they-re not impactful enough</strong>. Kagutsuchi is generic beast-warrior but our other lv4 is Fraktall, it is better to resolve Fraktall eff than make it rank 4 Bujin. Ahashima only gives s/t pops (Knightmare Phoenix is better) and ss from hand (Ferrijit is better), cant link climb too.  Tri-Brigade: 3 Fraktall, 3 Kerass, 1 One for One, 1 Foolish Burial (best cards, along with One for One cus they accomplish the same). 2 Nervall (Fraktall/One for One/Foolish Burial target). 2 Revolt as it is searchable but kinda bad if drawn multiple cus you want more monster in opening hand as Tri-Brigade fodder, applies to this deck in general that's why we run many monsters.  3 Tenki is a must as Bujin or Fraktall search. 1 Jackalope, Dogman, Thunderbird (draw, Tri-Brigade fodder, free body). The rest is just good staples with synergy, Upstart (digs for starter card, I havent found other draw card that is compatible with this deck), Monster Reborn (re-summon Tri-Brigade for spam/Shuraig trigger), 3 D.D. Crow (good winged-beast handtrap), 2 Alpha the Master of Beasts (great card but dead going first).  Pros: Super consistent, legit board with follow-up, unique combo/control play.

Hope your opponent doesn't ash you first/second turn (hint: he can't if you use Unveiling to Special Summon your minions) and then set up your board with the cards you drew.  The Bamboo Engine + Rella is there to help you draw and Cursed works really well with the Witchcrafters cause you discard it for cost and add one bamboo card from your deck.  Let me know what you think  P.S.

Needelfiber-Auroradon Combo, searching 3-4 Ritual Monsters/Spells and setting up a Nekroz of Unicore protected by Valkyrus and Trishula in Hand and preparing follow-up plays for turn 2. (Full Combo below)  2. Vanity's Ruler Combo, searching Cyber Angel Benten, Evigishki Gustkraken and Gishki Aquamirror with Preparation of Rites, the Impcantation engine and Extra-Foolish Burial, then ritual summoning Gustkraken, hand-looping for one, searching Vanity's Ruler by the effect of the Benten tributed to summon Gustkraken and then tribute summoning the Vanity's Ruler over Gustkraken and any available Impcantation monster, making the opponent unable to special summon without affecting you and therefore allowint follow up plays.  &nbsp;  I've opted to not play any Handtraps as this Deck seems to start bricking very fast when you start to play non-engine cards, but I suppose you could leave out the Gishki package and the Vanity's Ruler package to atleast allow for 4 Handtraps, either 2 Ash 2 Skull Meister or The Psy-Frame package (which here would probably be used more frequently to negate the activation of an Ash to respond to an Impcantation Monster, Preparation of Rites or Extra-Foolish Burial than as an actual Hand-Trap, but that also allows you to play Psy-Frame-Lord Omega to loop an additional card out of your opponents Hand, I would then exchange the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon for Omega) However I recommend no Handtraps.  &nbsp;  The Needlefiber-Combo goes as follows:          (I will explain the abbreviations below)  NS DB3, SS DB1, LS Needlefiber, SS DB1, LS Auroradon, SS 3 Tokens, SS both DB1 from grave with their own effect, synchro summon a HAL and Crystron Quandrax with a DB1 and a token each, XYZ Cowboy, detach HAL, burn for 800, search a Ritual Monster/Spell, use Auroradon to tribute the Cowboy and the remaining token, SS Coltwing from Deck, SS two Tokens by Coltwings effect, SS both DB1 from grave by their own effect, synchro summon two HAL, XYZ Dugares, Dugares effect, detach both HAL and SS the HAL that you detatched off Cowboy earlier, search two Ritual Monsters/Spells, set up your board as you like, you could use your remaining HAL either as a negate or as tribute for a Nekroz of Unicore to search your fourth Ritual Monster/Spell. Going Second you could use thr remaining HAL and the Coltwing that should still be on board to go into Number 27, if you manage to dismantle your opponents board and proceed to BP, you will only need to do 5200 damage if you can destroy an opponents monster with Number 27, as that will allow you to go into Gustav MAX afterwards to burn for 2000 and close out the game, as your opponent will have taken 800 by Cowboy's effect already.  NS = Normal Summon  SS = Special Summon  LS = Link Summon  XYZ = XYZ Summon  HAL = Herald of Arc Light  DB3 = Deskbot 003  DB1 = Deskbot 001  BP = Battle Phase  &nbsp;  The Side Deck focuses on improving the Going-Second capacities of the deck with Dark Ruler No More! as a blowout and Kaijus; Pankratops and Mind Control as spot removal.  3 Cosmic Cyclone and Red Reboot for Backrow-Hate.  3 Different Dimension Ground for Graveyard  Hate.  &nbsp;"

And no, this is not a JoJo reference. This deck is a reference TO a JoJo reference! https://ygoprodeck.com/road-roller-da/  &nbsp;  Infinitrack is already an Xyz deck that focuses on going second and attacking with strong monsters. In addition to that, the ""Infinitrack"" Xyz Monsters attach the monsters they destroy by battle as material, and Infinitrack Goliath can attach itself to one of them (Which protects any Machine-type Xyz Monster it's attached to from being destroyed by card effects). So naturally, AA-ZEUS would be a welcome addition to the deck...  &nbsp;  That is, if not for the fact that Infinitrack Brutal Dozer locks you into EARTH Machines if you use its second effect, which makes it one of the most important cards in the archetype. Because of this restriction, I decided to put Brutal Dozer in the Side Deck.  &nbsp;  Anyways, if you manage to get an AA-ZEUS that has Infinitrack Goliath attached as material, you get a 3K beatstick that can nuke the field, and can't be destroyed by effects. And the fact that you can banish Infinitrack Tunneler or Trencher from your Graveyard to either revive an Infinitrack or draw 2 cards makes AA-ZEUS even better for the deck!  &nbsp;  Finally, if you put Brutal Dozer in the Main Deck, make sure to put the 3 copies of Electro-Magnetic Railgun there too. Since Brutal Dozer stops you from summoning AA-ZEUS, you can use Railgun to tribute one of your Machine monsters and destroy 1 card on the field for every 1000 ATK that monster had."

Sprigguns lacks consistency and starters, but the Machina mini engine fits perfectly here.  It provides easy access to a rank 4 and a level 8 monster that can loop a lvl 4. Springguns also lacks a good normal summon, and you can use Machina Gearframe in this case (ally birdman can turn into lavalval salamander, or be used to loop the Machina Gearframe if you get ash'ed).  Credits for the machina engine:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxBEw9L2gMc  The ratios for the main monsters are calculated to achieve better opening hands, with at least: <ul>  	<li>A way to activate Vast Desert Gold Golgonda</li>  	<li>Any other Springguns card, but monsters are prefered here</li> </ul> The handtraps are a cheap way to achieve a minimun protection, that the deck also lacks.  Your standart combo would be a rank 4(either Gear Giant X, Dugares or Sprigguns Merry Maker), and from there you can ramp things.  For the extra deck choices: <ul>  	<li>Lavalval Salamander and Dugares are your ways of unbricking if anything ever goes wrong(Basically, every single sprigguns monster is a Garnet in essence)</li>  	<li>You can use Vespenate to remove Sprigguns Merry Maker from your field, in order to use the field spell effect again in a third turn scenario;</li>  	<li>Barricadeborg can retrieve your field spell and protect it;</li>  	<li>Knightmare Phoenix to remove backrow;</li>  	<li>Gear Giant X can search for Springgus monsters, usually you want Brothers or Pede, and a Rocky in your Graveyard.</li>  	<li>Number 38 and Borreload are your go to monsters if you need to protect yourself or remove a annoying monster;</li>  	<li>Dingirsu is the best single xyz monster you can summon for this deck. This card is incredible.</li> </ul> The side deck is mostly cards you can possibly use...but arent good.  Bricks not good enough to use in the main deck: <ul>  	<li>Supreme Archserpent Golgonda;</li>  	<li>Gearspring Spirit;</li>  	<li>Trade-in;</li>  	<li>Other Sprigguns cards(I'm considering removing Sprigguns Booty as well);</li> </ul> Not good enough Starters: <ul>  	<li>Planet Pathfinder - Not needed actually;</li>  	<li>Scrap Recycler - It's Just incompatible, it's also a level 3 EARTH;</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial - Not needed</li>  	<li>Monster Express - Just...Bad and slow;</li> </ul> Not good enough generic cards and extenders: <ul>  	<li>Minerva, The exalted Lightsworn - Can actually work with card trooper and machine duplication in a mill variant I'm working on;</li>  	<li>Card Trooper - Same as Minerva;</li>  	<li>Xyz Gift - Situational;</li>  	<li>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos - Bad summon conditions;</li>  	<li>Dark Factory of More Production - Good card but too slow.

(Rough draft! Criticism needed!),"OK, I know I'm late as f**k, but I got DOOM Eternal this month, and I absolutely love the game! So for my final deck profile of 2020, I made this go-second Burning Abyss build named after the most famous song in the game's soundtrack!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  As I just said, this is a Burning Abyss deck meant to go second every single game. I'm not sure how to improve the deck, but I'm gonna give you the run down on its strategy.  &nbsp;  The goal is to summon Dante--ideally while you also control Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss. When you attack with Dante, then you summon Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, who is basically the BFG-9000 of Yu-Gi-Oh! AA-ZEUS by itself is broken. Sending Burning Abyss monsters to the graveyard to activate its nuke effect is OP, especially since you can send Scarm to the Graveyard to search a Tour Guide, or Dante to add Cir to the hand.  &nbsp;  And to make matters worse, if this thing is in a zone that Cherubini points to, it can't be destroyed by card effects!  &nbsp;  Now, an indestructible AA-ZEUS isn't this card's only strategy. If you're able to OTK, you can make Borrelsword Dragon or Accesscode Talker. As an alternative, you can link summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with I:P Masquerena to make a near-unkillable boss monster!"

One fun goal for this deck was trying to make every card summonable and technically infinite. I think we've achieved it! Per usual, always conduct Dogmatika plays after plans of summoning from the extra deck. AA-Zeus comes out quite frequently in this build, due to the ease of Rank 8s. Necroface recycles all the Eldlich traps, and Chaos Creator recycles Necroface. Fallen of Albaz is added for flavor points and for easily dealing with Dragoon. There are 2 required normal summons (Necroface and Fallen), with up to 5 normal summons if you choose to include Ecclesia. 8 hand traps are included, but you can easily take out the ""Chaos package"" of Fallen of Albaz, Necroface, Chaos Creator, and Chaos Emperor to bring that number up to 11, in addition to adding a Kaiju or another tech option. The goal with this deck is to slow your down and then OTK with Liebe or Dogmatika."

The hard garnet is Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, also you can't go off with both Nabla's or two Karakuri's in hand. You'll need Plaguespreader to send these back into the deck to go full combo. You can use Armageddon Knight (summon with Isolde) to toss Plaguespreader Zombie and stuff back any garnets you may have drawn.  98% of the time you are good to go.

Normal summon SR, send machina citadel (MC) to the deck, then search machina irradiator (MI) and machina possesstorage (MP) out of the deck using MR. Special summon MI, sending MP to the graveyard, then use MI's effect to send it to the graveyard, chaining MC's effect to special summon it, to then special summon MP, to then use MP's effect to bring back MI. At this point you should have MI, SR, MP and MC on the field.  Then, send SR and MP to the graveyard to then link summon Scrap Wyvern (SW), to then special summon Scrap Golem (SG), discarding the random spell card you placed face-down. Then, special summon SR to the field , using SG's effect (sending Gizmek Orochi (GO) to the grave as SR was special summoned). Then, link summon apollousa (AP), using SW, SG and SR. Then, use GO's effect to banish 8 card from the top of your deck, special summoning GO. Then, Xyz summon your Draglubion (DLUBE) using GO and MI, continuing to use DLUBE's effect to detach a material, special summoning Number 100: Numeron Dragon, attaching Number 32 as a material. This ends your turn with a Numeron Dragon with 8000 attack, and a Raigeki in the form of Machina Citadel.  If you had another Number Dragon card, you special summon that to increase Numeron Dragon's attack even further. If you had a Number 92: Heart-Earth Dragon, you could have a much stronger board, but that card is expensive."

An amazing combo nobody knows about.,"Tenyi cards have incredible synergy with eldlich cards since your traps are technically non effect monsters. Ashuna and Adhara both make your grind game even more powerful than standard eldlich, allowing you to win in mirror and even keep up with drytron. The counter trap gives you 3 more answers to cards like duster, reboot, lightning storm and evenly. As well as being able to be used in conjunction with your board wipes in order to out boards with multiple spell speed 2 negates. The field spell is basically always live and lets you outgrind even harder, it's technically neg when you first use it and you don't have handtraps to draw into, but eldlich will not get OTK'd even going second thanks to busted cards like needle ceiling and your attack blocking capabilities."

I was a Godzilla fan in middle school, and I started to become one again in 2020. So while I was cooped up in my house last year, I found out that several statues of the King of the Monsters can be seen scattered throughout Tokyo, Japan. Which is kinda appropriate, seeing as how Tokyo has a target on its back in his movies. Seriously, the people living there just can't catch a break...  &nbsp;  So if you ever wanna go to Tokyo, Japan, now you have a good reason to go!  &nbsp;  Now, anyone who's actually played Trains knows that they want to go second every single game, especially since this deck has Kaijus in it.  Your goal is to summon a Rank 10 (Or Dreadnought Dreadnought if you can't) and attack. If you don't OTK your opponent, use your Xyz monster to summon AA-ZEUS. And in case your opponent is running a backrow-heavy deck--or just has backrow period--this deck uses 2 Lightning Storm and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  And if you're playing against more competitive decks, the Side Deck has some meta cards, as well as some draw power and cards that punish your opponent for using hand traps (AKA, Triple Tactics Talent and Called by the Grave). So have fun rampaging at your locals and summoning your big monsters!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The choice to go for Abyss statue merely depends by the fact I play three <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, which is the strongest removale, but also OTK strategy, of the deck: when abyss statue is on the field, you may instantly win (for instance against Drytron, Adamancipator, Eldlich, but also Virtual World), or at least you force your opponent to play dark monsters, which is a plus using <a data-name=""Predaplant Anaconda Verte"">Predaplant Anaconda Verte</a>!  I removed TGU, since it is such a weak card aganst and negation + removal.  For what concerns trap cards, you can literally do whatever you like. I removed any virus, or any trap that requires a tribute as cost, since the Deck is very weak if you brick.  I hope you will enjoy trolling your opponents by not letting them play, using ""not so meta"" cards ;D !!!  P.S. I am patiently waiting for a stronger level 4 Fiend monster than the available ones, to enhance even more the usage of Ties, without depending on it. (since Stygian is still a brick).

Ankuriboh),"This here is an old Dinosaur deck I made in 2018, upgraded to fit the current format as well as possible. The deck uses a tech choice that not many people would expect to see: Ankuriboh.  Because this Dinosaur deck uses Ankuriboh and Monster Reborn to revive your monsters, I named this deck ""Life Finds A Way"" in reference to <em>Jurassic Park. </em>  &nbsp;  And because it's a Dinosaur deck that does not use Pot of Extravagance, you wanna go second 9 times out of 10. As for Ankuriboh itself, let's focus on its second effect first. If it gets destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can add a Monster Reborn from your Deck or graveyard to your hand during the End Phase. Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can destroy it while it's in your hand, so you don't need to have it on your field. Also, it's first effect is okay, since Dinosaur decks have some good monsters to revive with it. If your opponent attacks, you can discard Ankuriboh to summon one of the following:  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Souleating Oviraptor to search or mill a Dinosaur.</li>  	<li>Animadorned Archosaur to destroy a Babycerasaurus, Petiteranodon, or Overtex Quatlus and search a Double Evolution Pill.</li>  	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops to target and pop one of your opponent's cards.</li>  	<li>Secure Gardna to protect yourself from taking battle or effect damage one more time (Or just once, if it was sent to the Graveyard <em>before</em> the Battle Phase).</li>  	<li>Borrelsword Dragon, since it has 3000 ATK, can't be destroyed by battle, and can switch one of your opponent's monsters to Defense Positon.</li> </ul>"

The ""Watt"" archetype features a lot of little Thunder-Type critters that have low stats but some helpful effects in terms of battling. The archetype also has some Synchro monsters to work with, but since I decided against running any of the ""Watt"" Tuners and those are specifically needed to summon them I did not include them. But there are other options in the Extra Deck to make up for that.</p> <p>""<a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattcobra"">Wattcobra</a>"" are the direct attackers of the deck, with ""<a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a>"" stopping the opponent from activating cards and effects after damaging them, while ""<a data-name=""Wattcobra"">Wattcobra</a>"" does the absolutely delightful job of searching whenever it damages the opponent via direct attack. ""<a data-name=""Wattwoodpecker"">Wattwoodpecker</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattsquirrel"">Wattsquirrel</a>"" are able to attack twice during each Battle Phase; they do have additional effects, but most of the time they are just needed to push some damage. ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" can create the well-known ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" lock, which can stop the opponent from attacking or targeting your ""Watt"" monsters. ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" is the only three-off, since it serves as a battle searcher. This means that you can technically fend off up to three attacks by searching ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" whenever one dies to battle and can end the chain with ""<a data-name=""Wattlemur"">Wattlemur</a>"", which will prohibit the opponent from using next turn's Battle Phase if it gets destroyed.</p> <p>In addition to the ""Watt"" monster line-up, there is only one more monster in the Main Deck, but it is of paramount importance overall: ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"". This monster functions as a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs if summoned, which is not as important; but it also once per turn summons a ""Batteryman Token"" which helps summoning Link monsters. The only problem is that it often wants to take the Normal Summon slot, so we have to work around that. I provided a few options to make summoning easier: ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" provides access to ""<a data-name=""Kaminari Attack"">Kaminari Attack</a>"", which not only triggers the token summoning of effect of ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" but also allows the deck to summon ""<a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>"" to have access to a larger beater. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" can search for ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"", which can give you the ""<a data-name=""Watthopper"">Watthopper</a>"" lock there and then if you have the other copy in hand but also triggers ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" also provides another monster, but for instant access into a Link-4 monster you can play the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>"": Normal Summon ""Batteryman Solar"", play ""<a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>"" to gain two tokens and gain another one via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"".</p> <p>The backrow includes some other cards aswell: ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" provides sizeable ATK boosts depending on the monster on your field, ""<a data-name=""Psychic Blade"">Psychic Blade</a>"" can always provide a flat 2000 ATK boost but costs life points to do so and ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" allows every monster you play to check opposing hitters, with ""<a data-name=""Wattsquirrel"">Wattsquirrel</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Wattwoodpecker"">Wattwoodpecker</a>"" even destroying two monsters. ""<a data-name=""Wattkey"">Wattkey</a>"" allows all the ""Watt"" monsters in your deck that cannot already directly attack to do so; the card is by no means required, but is a searchable one-off that can give the double attackers what they need to OTK. One ""<a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a>"" can keep opposing monsters in check without completely invalidating yours.</p> <p>Trap-wise I included ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"" as an Equipment-searching surprise that can give your monsters bigger stats on reaction, one ""<a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>"" to prevent damage/destruction, one ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>"" against opposing attacks, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Bye Bye Damage"">Bye Bye Damage</a>"" to potentially kill an unsuspecting opponent via their own attack, two ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" as useful recurring ATK decreases and monster effect negates, two ""<a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>"" to get rid of opposing monsters/defenses while gaining Link material and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Thunder Dragons' Hundred Thunders"">Thunder Dragons' Hundred Thunders</a>"" as a ""<a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" sort of card, but with the added bonus of allowing you to revive three copies of ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"" once they hit the graveyard.</p> <p>One three-off that I left out so far is ""<a data-name=""Wattrain"">Wattrain</a>"", which is both useful as a multi-searcher and as a swarming tool. Playing it after ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" did its summon will normally net you three additional ""Watt"" cards and swarming the field one turn later is slow but very helpful in the deck.</p> <p>The Extra Deck, aside from the two Fusion monsters, runs basically options that might help the deck in various situations. Both ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" provide backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" provide answers against opposing monsters. ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" keeps the graveyard in check. ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"" can boost a direct attacker, ""<a data-name=""Hip Hoshiningen"">Hip Hoshiningen</a>"" boosts all Light monsters, ""<a data-name=""Some Summer Summoner"">Some Summer Summoner</a>"" can technically trigger ""<a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>"" again but can also opt to resummon ""<a data-name=""Wattlemur"">Wattlemur</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Wattdragonfly"">Wattdragonfly</a>"". The Link-3 and Link-4 monsters really just provide more of the same but the ""Borrel"" monsters really give the ""Watt"" deck attacking power that they rarely ever had before.</p> <p>""Watt"" is a fairly interesting archetype since it does little in both stats and effect text but can still perform some plays on a non-competitive level. Sadly, there is not that much more going on with them and they do rather poorly in more serious environments.

Your main strategy is to get out The Creator and special summon a bunch of boss monsters from the graveyard, whilst making sure The Creator doesn't perish.

The goofball known as ChupiTrooper returns with yet another Time Thief list! What's gotten into him THIS time? Is he plotting some grand heist to ring in the new year? Has he finally lost it and begun to plot his revenge against those who wronged him?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...Nah. It's just the chemicals in my brain responding to super weird rogue strategies acting up again.  Odd and boisterous intro aside, Happy New Year, all! Congratulations on surviving the prior, taken as you will. Figure I may as well start this year off with something interesting I discovered.  Now, I'm sure my previous list, the post-Phantom Rage build of Phantom Thieves of Time can show off the unity that these history-altering vigilantes can exhibit with fellow DARK doofuses. But what about their capabilities going solo?  Well, I'd say that I and all fifteen other players of Time Thieves are in luck! By some strange miracle, Konami had the heart to grace us with another wave of support for these guys! (albeit somewhat sparse and not what we were initially expecting) Guess they really do care for these guys after all. First the indirect support line that was Phantom Rage's collection of Phantom Knights, Raidraptor, and Xyz Dragon bolstering attempts, now this. Which, I can't complain. Any friend of sweet ol' handsome Mr. Redoer's a friend of mine.  Back to the original point, it seems I've spent so much time splashing PK's with these bad boys that I never really realized how well these guys have it playing it solo. Well, maybe ""solo"" isn't too accurate given the presence of some certain LIGHT-Attribute helpers here, but I digress. Truth is, these guys can actually get a lot done if you focus on them and them alone! Not to say other variants of Time Thieves aren't on its level. Play whatever sings to ya, you crazy metaphorical choir conductor!  Though, full disclosure. And credit where credit is due. I've cited a majority of the decklist, combos, and ideas for this article from the two lovely lads known as <strong>BladeYGO</strong> and <strong>Rogue Theory</strong> on YouTube in their recent collaboration, <strong><span>Time Thief - A Timely Guide (Lore &amp; Archetype Explained!) - Yu-Gi-Oh!. </span></strong><span>Go do yourself a big favor and check out both that video and their other content, they had me sold from this and this alone! Not to mention, they're far more talented and knowledgeable on these silly TCG matters than I'll likely ever be.</span>  <span><strong>The wonderful video in question:</strong></span> <a href=""https://youtu.be/2Rab5Am4fmk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/2Rab5Am4fmk</a>  <span><strong>BladeYGO's Channel:</strong></span> <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfpwDdx3MNcWNYZEByt3qg</a>  <strong><span>Rogue Theory's Channel:</span></strong> <a>https://www.youtube.com/user/megamanox1</a>  &nbsp;  With that out of the way, and without further ado, my take on pure Time Thieves awaits! Holy cow, what kinda energy crept into me while typing this? But yeah, the deck is all about Xyz material and opponent's card manipulation, bouncing out card to avoid disruptive effects, and overall just biting back hard if your opponent dares to try anything devious against you.  As always, I'll opt to go in order of archetypes, as to demonstrate each card in a set organization to go over what they do for the deck. <h2><span>Time Thieves</span></h2> The stars of the show. The head honchos. The big dogs---well, five head honchos and a dog, per se.  Time Thieves are back in quack-tion, at least in my humble opinion, and they're more than capable of messing with your opponent's field, deck, GY, and head in such a way that the ""Virus"" Traps could only dream of doing. Five Main Deck monsters and three Extra Deck monsters deep may seem kinda underwhelming, but these guys more than make up for it with what I believe to be one of the most interesting and sly methods of interaction ever since their Savage Strike Debut. <ul>  	<li>Rounding things off as always is the mandatory three-of and equally as loyal pooch, <b><a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a></b>. Best Normal Summon in the deck, and card you want to open with, though bringing him out with a certain tribal Quick-Play Spell will do equally as well. Either way, when he's all alone on the field, he tributes himself to round up a pair of his differently-named brethren from the deck in Defense. This not only lets you set up an Xyz Summon like nothing, but also allows you to proc some of your most useful effects to get your plays started. Its second effect revives itself should an Xyz Monster you control be walked over by an opponent's monster, with the threat of being banished should it leave the field afterwards. Man's best friend, I tell you. Or um, should it be man, woman, and double machine's best friend in this case?</li>  	<li>Next in the line of three-ofs is the second most handsome go-getter in the deck, acting as both a play starter and extender when the situation calls. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a></b></span> is something else, lemme tell ya. Should you Normal Summon him or activate his in-hand effect to Special Summon himself by detaching a material from an Xyz monster you control, he allows for the search of any ""Time Thief"" card in your deck, barring himself. Truth be told, if he's summoned period, you can activate his effect just as easily! Makes wish every Main Deck searcher was this intuitive.</li>  	<li>About time this deck got its dedicated Foolish-ing system, no pun intended. Popping up in Ghosts From the Past as Perpetua's past pupil, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Adjuster"">Time Thief Adjuster</a></b></span>'s the young lassie we've all been waiting for. Her first effect gives you the option whenever your other Time Thief is summoned, to summon her from your hand as a freebie. Her other's more important, however, as she lets you send a ""Time Thief"" card of any kind from your deck to your GY. That way, you can set up the effects of the last two Main Deck Thieves or one of their backrow when the time comes! One little thing, however. Whoever decided Adjuster needed to have the same ""only one effect per turn, and only once that turn"" clause as the Elemental HEROes Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier needs like, a very light bonk on the noggin with a squeaky hammer. Just sayin'.</li>  	<li>Whether you're playing one or two of this next monster, he definitely puts in some work. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a></b></span>, who looks like a projectile weapon from Touhou or Legend of Dark Witch or something, has the core role of reviving himself from the GY by detaching an Xyz material from one of your monsters, a la Winder. Unlike Winder, though, he has the same fear of leaving the field for a reason other than future Xyz material much like Regulator. But! If you should bring him out with say, a Normal Summon, the tribal Quickie, or the second-best tribal Xyz yet to come, he can tribute himself as a Quickie to attach any card from your opponent's GY to a Time Thief you control as material. In an era where Called by the Grave has been sadly Limited, this is some GY disruption worth noting. As I mentioned in my previous Time Thief list, your opponent can't use what's no longer in their GY. So chaining this effect to say, a Monster Reborn or similar revival or retrieval effect is nothing short of the bee's knees.</li>  	<li>Sorry OTK'ers, you won't have an easy time doing your job while <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Chronocorder"">Time Thief Chronocorder</a></b></span>'s on his. The reasoning for that being that he tributes himself during your opponent's Battle Phase to give you a one-time protection against battle damage. How, may you ask? Your opponent just takes the damage for you! I like to consider this Destiny HERO - Dynatag on espresso. Though you'd really only use this particular effect of his in the case of an emergency. The effect of his you really wanna go for, however, is when any Xyz Monster of yours leaves the field by a card effect (including the main man's own), he revives himself from the GY to be used as future material or the aforementioned damage reflection in a pinch. One to two will do you just fine, much like Bezel Ship.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Starting the Extra Deck off right is the big man himself. The star of the show is none other than YGO's best husband with a black card border, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a></b></span>. The thing that might draw you to him the most is the fact that he can essentially replenish his own materials by attaching the top card of your opponent's deck to him every Standby Phase. That, and he's blessed with being brought out with any two generic Level 4 monsters. But let me tell you, this guy is far more than a splash into Traptrix or Phantom Knights. As a Quick Effect at any time in any turn, once per turn, you can detach up to three kinds of materials from him to activate corresponding effects. For a Monster, he banishes himself until the turn's conclusion in order to dodge attacks, disruptive effects, you name it. This makes him VERY hard to take out in the right hands. For a Spell, he nets you a free draw akin to Jar of Greed. And what I consider to be his best, detaching a Trap gives you a non-targeting, non-destruction removal of any face-up card your opponent has in store, simply by placing that sucker atop the deck. I cannot tell you how many times this has saved my skin. Your opponent thinks they've got Redoer on the ropes with a non-targetable or destructible bungus like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon and the like, but a generic Rank 4 with a purple card under it can inexplicably dispatch it like it's nothing. And as you'll see further on, there will be multiple ways to put a Trap under this guy.</li>  	<li>Case in point, Redoer's very own prime partner comes in the form of <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a></b></span>. She's like the cleric and technical genius of the team, which isn't surprising given her lore and portrayal through her different iterations of the card artwork in this tribe. During either Standby Phase (remind ya of anyone?), she detaches a material in order to revive any Time Thief monster from your GY other than herself. This can be Winder for additional searching, Adjuster for more Foolish-ing, Bezel Ship during your opponent's turn to snatch their GY resources, or either of her fellow Xyz leaders should they kick the bucket prematurely. As another Quick Effect, she targets any of your Xyz monsters, emphasis on ""any"", to attach a Time Thief card from deck to them as material. That way you can get Redoer the Chronocorder or tribal Trap he needs at the moment, or replenish just about any other good Xyz monster you'd like to utilize more! She and Redoer are a match made in heaven. In an on-field sense, that is. Can't really confirm whether or not these two are a thing in-lore.</li>  	<li>I gawked when I first saw it, too. Another Extra Deck Time Thief? You'd think they'd get a tribal Link Monster (I can spitball like a dozen ideas for how it could work), but I suppose for now <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Doublebarrel"">Time Thief Doublebarrel</a></b></span> will fill that void just fine. I too shed an imaginary comically-sized sweat droplet when I found he couldn't attach his own materials and had to wait until the opponent used an effect to use his, but after some consideration, he can get the job done. Detaching a Monster nets him 400 extra ATK, which doesn't usually mean much but can add up and remains permanent unlike the tribal Continuous Spell. Speaking of, detaching a Spell makes him a walking non-targeting Crackdown (Jinzo - Layered, is that you?). But his best one is for detaching a Trap, which is all too familiar. Doing so is netting you a non-targeting Effect Monster negation, plain and simple (How about them apples, Dragoon?). You'll more than likely have to rely on the other Thieve's effects to make the Trap attachment to him possible, though. But I wouldn't sweat that all too much. He's more of a sidekick than a new star of the show in my eyes, but that's not to say he hasn't earned his keep. Also, I wholly agree with Mr. Rogue Theory that this guy should be localized as ""Time Thief Do-Over."" Rolls off the tongue FAR better than any of the localized Virtual World monsters, and just makes all the sense in context for Time Thieves in general.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Barring the gadgets that make up two of the Main Deck monsters, the Time Thieves have some other nifty tools of trade to get things started. First up being <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a></b></span>, a Quick-Play that summons a Time Thief monster from your hand for free. This can de-brick your hand and get more materials on the board in a split, and also allows you to bring out Regulator for his effect without expending your Normal Summon. Alternatively in a future turn, you can banish it from your GY to attach one of each Time Thief card type to a Time Thief Xyz monster you control as material. A triple material replenish, especially to apply for all the effects of Redoer or Do-Over (Yes, I'll be referring to Doublebarrel as that for the remainder of the article), can make a heck of a difference. Especially when your deck feels all but depleted of ammo for the pair of troublemakers.</li>  	<li>A Continuous Spell that might not be all too important but still sees some good use, <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack </a></b></span>earns its stripes in two good ways. During the turn your Xyz monsters hit the field, they can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects. As its second option, it lets you target an Xyz monster you control to give them a turn-wide power-up of 300 ATK for every material on it. And if at least one of them happens to belong to your opponent, direct attacking becomes an option for them! Imagine hopping over so many big beatsticks on your opponent's side like nothing. Just ah, beware of like, Drowning Mirror Force and stuff like that.</li>  	<li>For Traps, these guys have it made. <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> </b></span>is good on-field or in the GY, for activating it lets you attach any Time Thief card from deck to your Time Thief Xyz monster as material. Typically another Flyback if Perpetua's not around to do so already. But if your opponent's silly enough to pop this card on field, they're just opening a whole nother can of worms. Either way, its effect in GY banishes itself to play Bezel Ship's game of snatching a GY card of your foe's for Redoer, Perpetua, or Do-Over's own. That way, you can really stick it to them for popping it in the first place!</li>  	<li>And now for another card that's gonna save your skin when the situation calls. One of your primary search targets with Winder, a Counter Trap that can come in unbelievable clutch is <span><b><a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a></b></span>. Like Rogue Theory says, this thingie can be very telegraphed, but not necessarily any less hard to deal with once it's live. Case in point, if Redoer, Perpetua, or Do-Over are on the field at all, this baby lets you negate the activation of your opponent's backrow and then not destroy it, but attach it to one of those three as material. Imagine the insult to injury of negating their Trap, attaching it to Redoer or Do-Over, and then activating their effects to detach those suckers later on in the turn. Always keep at least one on standby, you never know when you'll need it.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Performage</span></h2> For those of you unfamiliar to how a lot of Fusion/Xyz setup decks tend to function, these guys might seem a little oddly-placed. But I can assure you, these dubious magician dudes in a sea of Psychics more than earn their keep. They're conditional freebies in a way, one of which can recur itself or its ally. <ul>  	<li>The one you've likely come to know best, either from the likes of Lightsworn or Shaddoll, happens to be <span><b><a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a></b></span>. His bouncing act upon that ball of his is quite fitting, as when he hits the GY by any means (discarding, detaching, Foolish-ing, you name it), he can target any Performage in your grave including himself to revive them at the cost of its whole stat line and 1000 of your LP. No worries, it's not too steep a price if you ask me. For another means of making my Rank 4's that doesn't require RNG this time around? Heck yeah, I'll ditch a stack for him!</li>  	<li>His partner in crime, being much easier to summon and not being a once-per-turn is <span><b><a data-name=""Performage Hat Tricker"">Performage Hat Tricker</a></b></span>. Simply if there are at least two monsters on the field, period, he's a freebie summon from hand that acts to extend your summons. As far as his effect to put a counter on him to prevent effect damage, I can't say I've been able to make too good use of that, even taking into account Trick Clown. But hey, all's good in the red-and-white-striped hood this pair hails from if you ask me.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>PSY-Frame</span></h2> Now I must have really lost it! You're telling me that in an archetype of Psychic-types, we're ACTUALLY going to run Psychic-type support cards? It sounds crazy, but yes! PSY-Frames happily make an appearance in this deck, and they're more synergistic with the second snatchers than you'd speedily suspect. They're likely the trio you'd expect, so I'll try and keep it brief. <ul>  	<li>It's no secret that the Main Deck pairing of <span><b><a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a></b></span> and <span><b><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></b></span> are capable of dishing out some serious payback to your opponent if they wanna try and use their monster effects. Simply put, while you have a barren field and your opponent activates a monster effect, a single Gamma in your hand will be a good blessing. From there he summons both himself and Driver from your hand, deck, or GY to render the effect null and void, and the monster destroyed. Heh, rhymes. Call me crazy, but this is actually a significant out if your opponent tries to Ash your Regulator! That way, you get four summons off Regulator tributing himself instead of just two. At the end of turn, the pair banish themselves into the abyss, unfortunately. But if it's during your turn, you're more than able to use them to make...</li>  	<li>Another shockingly synergistic pal, this time with a blue border! <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;PSY-Framelord Lambda&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>PSY-Framelord Lambda</strong></a> has made good friends with Redoer, believe me. For those of you scratching your heads, lemme try and explain. Lambda allows you to use Gamma's negation effect even if monsters are on your field. Meanwhile, if a Psychic of yours happens to become banished (Redoer's gotcha there with his monster detachment!), she lets you, at End Phase, add a Gamma from your deck to hand. So it's all the more worthwhile for you to summon her using an already-expended Gamma and Driver during your turn! That, or use them for a Synchro Summon or something. Whichever works.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Main Deck Staples</span></h2> Of course, I'd be silly to make a deck and not go over the more non-specific tools of trade included therein. So thankfully, that's what I've dedicated the next two sections for! <ul>  	<li>You may have seen him in Link-based decks, including my own just previously, but here he makes another fine appearance. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Parallel eXceed&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Parallel eXceed</strong></a> may be bricky, but provided you're able to Link up on the fly, he's a very useful extender. When you summon say, Lambda or Ahashima with an open Link point, make sure to plop this guy here so he brings out a copy of himself from deck, both at Level 4. And just like that, another Rank 4's at your feet!</li>  	<li>As if my inclusion of LIGHT-, WIND-, and EARTH-Attribute monsters in the Main Deck didn't seem crazy enough for me, here comes a WATER for good measure. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Xyz Slidolphin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Xyz Slidolphin</strong></a> isn't a face you'll see pop up too much, but he can act as either a freebie or an extra tool for one of your Xyz monsters. In hand, the former kicks in to bring him out to extend your plays. In grave, the same condition lets him tack on a third material to your up-and-coming Xyz monster for good measure. Dolphins truely are some of the wisest creatures on the planet, eh?</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Foolish Burial&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Foolish Burial</strong></a> sees play as more or less an emergency button if you've no other way to, say, bin Bezel Ship or Chronocorder. Or get Trick Clown out, for that matter. A one-of you can play without shame, since after some consideration I'm not too sure whether Upstart would have a fitting home here.</li>  	<li>Until these poor thieves get some tribal consistency to fetch out their searchers at the beginning of games, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Prosperity&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong></a> will have to do the job of grabbing your essential pieces to start things right. With the banish of 3 or 6 cards of your choice from the Extra Deck, likely your spare copies of Redoer, Perpetua, and some of the more situational Xyz and Links you've got, you look at the same number of cards from the top of your deck and snatch one to use immediately. It may take away some Extra Deck slots and ability to dome your opponent for lethal, <strong><em>not to speak of how expensive the dumb sucker is,</em></strong> but it'll get the job done. If this card's out of your price range, there's no shame in running <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Desires&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Desires</strong></a> in its place.</li>  	<li>This is more of an optional pick of mine I like to run for some more unusual removal, but you're cool to replace this with something you'd rather in its place. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Xyz Import&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Xyz Import</strong></a> is a heck of a card, lemme tell ya. Blessed with the symbol of Quick-Play Spell, on either turn it allows you to target a monster your opponent controls with equal or less ATK than an Xyz Monster of your choice, then yoinks that son of a gun to them as material. Not only does this let you get rid of monsters and interrupt plays in ways other decks otherwise can't, but imagine the craziness that'd ensue when a non-Time Thief can utilize the second half of Hack's power-up effect.</li>  	<li>It's an Xyz deck, so you know this pretty purple boy's gonna make an appearance. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</strong></a> is its name, and thanks to me you likely know this card by heart. Brings itself out as a Level 4 Normal Monster that's perfect for your Rank 4 summons. Best case scenario, to make either Redoer or Duo-ver. Speaking of, what looks and sounds better for Doublebarrel? Do-Over or Duo-ver? Pfft, I dunno.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><span>Extra Deck Staples</span></h2> It wouldn't be Time Thieves if they didn't have a toolbox of friends to call upon when the situation calls, now would it? As with Live and Evil Twins, these suckers are blessed to have several randos behind their back for the long haul. <ul>  	<li>Prime example being <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tornado Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tornado Dragon</strong></a>! He's a walking MST that gets two bits of ammo that can each be fired off once per turn. That's not to say you can't reload them using Perpetua, however! I swear, that lady's a cleric for this archetype in more ways than you'd first imagine.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Abyss Dweller&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Abyss Dweller</strong></a> is in the exact same camp, and he's beyond useful if you can spare the materials. As soon as possible during your opponent's turn, you'll want to give this bad boy a whirl as detaching a material from him shuts off your opponent's GY effects for all of their turn. And given the prevalence of decks using the GY as a second hand, I bet they won't be too prepared for a deck that uses the GY as their personal armory, now will they?</li>  	<li>Here to act as an emergency button coming in shocking clutch is another fun Rank 4, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</strong></a>. At the cost of one of his materials during your turn, he forces all non-Link monsters on the field into defense, and negates their activated effects so long as they remain in that position. This affects your stuff as well, but if you can whip out a good Link monster to play around that, I doubt you'll have too much trouble.</li>  	<li>Now THIS is a card you'll want to bring out a lot. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Bujinki Ahashima&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong></a> is a total blessing for Xyz decks as a whole, not just for her own tribe. Bringing her out with, say, the two monsters summoned off Regulator lets you bring out two L4's, one from your hand and the other from your GY, to immediately use them for an Xyz summon. This is a great way to get L4's out of your hand after you've already Normal Summoned or reuse the ones in your GY. Don't sleep on it, I urge you. Especially if you have your Xyz monster detach a material in its zone.</li>  	<li>Think he's in this deck because he's chasing after those who stole his time? Ahahahaaaaaaa, poor jokes aside, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 60: Dugares the Timeless&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</strong></a> makes use as either Prosperity ammo or in a powerful situational clutch. Detaching both his materials nets you a super strong effect with a drawback on your following turn. Whether you're using him to draw, revive, or power up, he's got his moments. Though more often than not, you're definitely using the former two effects. Fingers crossed he gets a reprint someday.</li>  	<li>Following Dugares in the ways of Prosperity fodder is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Number 101: Silent Honor ARK&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</strong></a>. You've likely seen this guy in the odd Duel Devastator box and didn't think blink twice. Well, I can't exactly say I blame you, but should he still be in your Extra Deck and you need to slurp up a Special Summoned attack position monster on your opponent's side a la Relinquished, this boisterous boat's got you covered. Or um, is it a starship? Could go either way, really.</li>  	<li>Trust me, you can make this bad boy turn 2 if you know what you're doing. And boy howdy is it worth it! Speaking of Dragoon-proof, in again careens <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong></a>. The second most valuable splashable boss for Xyz decks, your opponent can only dream of stopping this guy with effects or attacks from monsters that don't have black borders. And furthermore, he can revive an Xyz from your GY by snatching a card your opponent controls for its pal to use as material! It's so generic, useful, and downright terrifying, you'd swear it was printed in Duel Overload.</li>  	<li>Meanwhile, if you're in need of a swift offensive finisher to your games, you're always more than welcome to run the Utopia Double package. Herein lies <span><span><b><a data-name=""Number 31: Utopia Double"">Number 31: Utopia Double</a></b></span></span>, who searches <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Double or Nothing!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Double or Nothing!</span></strong></a> from deck to go into either <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Number 31: Utopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Number 31: Utopia</strong></a></span> or <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000080;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number S31: Utopia the Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;""><span><strong>Number S31: Utopia the Lightning</strong></span></a>. A good way to finish off things if you've no other option.</li> </ul> So yeah, there's the deck! To think a pure build of these guys can be just as competent as if you're splashing another big archetype into, which you're more than cool to do. Still though, I'll keep in mind some play notes for when you try this out yourself. <h2>Handy Play Notes</h2> <ul>  	<li>The starting combo that Rogue Theory laid out and I've confirmed as useful is as follows. First, bring out <strong><span>Regulator</span></strong> and tribute him for <strong><span>Winder</span></strong> and <span><strong>Adjuster</strong></span>. Chain block one of them effectively depending on whether you truly need a Retrograde or L4 right away to search with Winder, or to bin <span><strong>Bezel Ship</strong></span> or <strong><span>Chronocorder</span></strong> with Adjuster. From there, use both of them to make <span><strong>Bujinki Ahashima</strong></span>, who'll use either a <span><strong>Bezel Ship</strong></span>, <span><strong>Chronocorder</strong>,</span> or other L4 like <span><strong>Slidolphin</strong></span> or <strong><span>Trick Clown</span></strong> and a L4 from grave to make <span><strong>Redoer</strong></span>. From there, it's all a matter of reviving Bezel Ship and/or Chronocorder by any means necessary to make <strong><span>Perpetua</span></strong>, and either <strong><span>Do-Over</span></strong> or <span><strong>Abyss Dweller</strong></span> if you've got materials in reserve. Set the backrow cards you need to complete your task, and it's off to the races.</li>  	<li>During your opponent's turn, use Perpetua's primary Standby Phase effect to revive Bezel Ship from GY to get him up and running to snatch a card from your opponent when the time calls. And if necessary, use her second effect to attach a Flyback to Redoer so when he bounces himself and an opponent's card out later, you can snatch another card from your opponent by banishing Flyback. During your turn, use the aforementioned primary Perpetua effect to bring back Winder to replenish your hand or Adjuster if you're in need of extra Bezel Ships, Chronocorders, or Flybacks in GY.</li>  	<li>If you're looking to use Gamma during your opponent's turn, realize that it may be the only time you get to proc him since he and Driver go ""See ya, chief"" if they're still on the field come the End Phase. That's why it's worthwhile, if you're lucky enough to use them on your own turn, to Link them off into Lambda so Redoer's banishment can also net you a second Gamma to use the Driver in GY again.</li>  	<li>Still not too certain what the use in running Xyz Import is? Let's say, for example, your opponent has a setup monster that just so happens to be at or below the ATK of Redoer or Do-Over. Import's got you there by not only letting you remove them from your opponent's control and utility, but also to use as ammo for their future effects. And this can be any Xyz monster, not just the head honchos!</li> </ul> &nbsp;  And at long last, there's the pure Time Thieves in full. They've had quite a visit to other archetypes, but with the recent wave of support and confirmation that Duel Terminal is where they've resided this whole time, I'd say they're right at home where they belong.  As always, thanks again to BladeYGO and Rogue Theory for providing me with the inspiration and research that went into this, though I doubt I'll ever be at their awesome level. And thanks to you for reading! Hopefully you got some good insight as to what these guys are capable of. Or at the very least, a chuckle at my attempt to deliver such. Either way, hope you have a great rest of your day, and time piloting these thieves!  Resident closeted weirdo ChupiTrooper, signing off."

As the name indicates, it's Lv.1 Boardswarming time. This is my second attempt to update an older deck of mine from early MR4 since I'm just getting back into Yugioh.  Getting back to the basics, the strategy is to dump as many Lv.1's as possible on board early to go into a big boi like Dystopia, Zeroboros, or F0:Utopic Future.  Looking at the monsters, Jester Confit, Turbo boosters, and Big One Warrior (and mirror resonator to an extent) are free special summons to complement a subsequent normal summon of a Kinka-byo  Treeborn Frog is Treeborn Frog, dump it with either foolish burial or Big One Warrior  Other unique Lv.1's are more gimmicky, flavor-win, or pet piece inclusions to round out the count.  If a really good hand isn't drawn then hope there is something to turn through the deck like Magical Mallet or the other card advantage pieces. If not, go full stall-y degen with Mystic Mine, Evenly Matched, etc. until you can set the board up into favorable conditions.  From there, try to swing for lethal with the aforementioned big bois"

""Fortune Ladies"" are a fairly unique archetype with various effects that gain stats according to their level times a certain number. Right off the start, the Main Deck monsters are rather bad at battling despite the fact that this is actually an Aggro deck, but they can build a very potent draw engine that allows the Extra Deck to shine.</p> <p>The archetypal monsters in the deck consist of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Water"">Fortune Lady Water</a>"", who are the main monster of the draw engine due to allowing you to draw two cards whenever she is Special summoned while you control a ""Fortune Lady"" monster (not once per turn, btw.), three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" who searches other ""Fortune Ladies"" when she leaves the field due to an effect and three ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"" as a ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" enabler and very useful Tuner monster. The single copies include ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Dark"">Fortune Lady Dark</a>"", which can trigger a revival chain if all the stars align correctly, ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Fire"">Fortune Lady Fire</a>"" as monster removal with a useful burn effect and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Wind"">Fortune Lady Wind</a>"" who dabbles in backrow removal when Normal Summoned. I also included a some ""Fortune Fairy"" monsters since they also belong to the archetype: One ""<a data-name=""Fortune Fairy Hikari"">Fortune Fairy Hikari</a>"" helps with the summoning of either ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"" while still being useful to summon ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" in a pickle, while ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Swee"">Fortune Lady Swee</a>"" can take both your and the opposing monsters from the field temporarily for various effects.</p> <p>Due to the lack of disruption and sizeable beaters, I got inspired by ""DarkArmedDuelist"" and included a ""Silent Magician"" engine. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Silent Magician"">Silent Magician</a>"" can reach up to 4000 ATK in the deck with relative ease and provide Spell negation while they can also search the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Silent Magician LV8"">Silent Magician LV8</a>"" upon their demise.</p> <p>The backrow helps the archetype's strategy in various ways: ""<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>"" can fetch ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" to get rid of a monster, while also potentially summoning ""<a data-name=""Time Wizard of Tomorrow"">Time Wizard of Tomorrow</a>"" for a gimmicky nuke effect. ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" searches either ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Past"">Fortune Lady Past</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>"" is able to summon ""<a data-name=""Quintet Magician"">Quintet Magician</a>"" as a potential game-ender, the ""Spellbook"" engine of ""<a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>"" allows for searchable card draw that also triggers ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Calling"">Fortune Lady Calling</a>"" is a useful summoning tool that can fetch you ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Water"">Fortune Lady Water</a>"" for draws but can also summon all the others, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" is there due to various levels to hit, ""<a data-name=""Fortune's Future"">Fortune's Future</a>"" can use banished cards for further card draw, ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" gives more consistency by searching ""<a data-name=""Future Visions"">Future Visions</a>"" which is helpful for your ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a>"" while potentially screwing the opposing plays over, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" revives, ""<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>"" counters Hand Traps, ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Rewind"">Fortune Lady Rewind</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>""-esque card for the archetype and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Vision"">Fortune Vision</a>"" is a searcher with various useful effects added to it.</p> <p>The Extra Deck has, as usual, various options to help your game plan. We covered the Fusion monsters already, so there is only the same ratio of Synchro and Link monsters left to talk about. Since ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Calling"">Fortune Lady Calling</a>"" locks you into Synchro monsters it is nice to have some options, such as ""<a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"" as a sizeable and growing beater against certain matchups, ""<a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>"" as a really solid negation/beatdown tool, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" as a field nuke, ""<a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>"" as another negate and ""<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Every"">Fortune Lady Every</a>"" for both her recurrence and the banish effect. The Link options consist of ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" to get yourself rid of the attack restriction of ""<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>"" while also walling single monsters, the ""Knightmare"" engine as removal and ""<a data-name=""Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a>"" as a level manipulation tool with added monster destruction.</p> <p>""Fortune Lady"" really seems like a deck that is rather fickle. One game you might be able to draw 10+ cards due to your combo working perfectly well, while completely bricking in the next game. They are certainly interesting to play and use some effects that you do not see that often in the game.

You shouldn´t expect to outgrind something like Eldlich, but most of the time you can.  The new Ravenwing/ Blackfeather (what ever his name is to you) is amazing, it is basically a +2. For the most time you won´t have a problem to mill a Plunder, so u get a free recursion plus a special summon, also if u milled Bluebeard you can special summon him too.  Also if u use Ravenwing + Redbeard to link off into Blackbeard u can equip the redbeard of its own effect and then special summon him back of the effect of Ravenwing, so u got a material for Blackbeard.  Don´t get me started on the possibilities u get with Ravenwing + Goldenhair, for example you can pitch Goldenhair for any effect, then activate Ravenwing to recur her, then use Goldenhairs effect to special her, then u can link em off into Blackbeard. Now you can special Goldenhair from GY again of her effect (since her special summons are two different effects and both can be used once per turn) and if u got an equipped Plunder u could special this one too because of Ravenwing.  As I mentioned this card is amazing, recursion + special summon + replacement for zero cost (since most of the time you will be locked into Plunders anyway).  Now I would like to explain my deck choices. You will be playing 3 of any Plunder monster, because all are at least useable (redbeard) and most of them are really good (Whitebeard/Goldenhair/Ravenwing). 3 Pot of desires, so you play almost anything as 3 and you need the draw power. 3 Shipyarrds, the field spell is amazing it mills and it searches - amazing, therefore also 1 Terraforming. 2 Shipshape ship shipping, honestly you can play 3 of them since this card is very good for discarding and it frees you from a light monster to summon lys and it equips plunder cards, but it´s my least favorable card and I don´t wanna play more than 40 cards. At last 3 booty, amazing card recursion + attribute choice - really important card btw. My handtraps are 3 ash, 2 veiler, 3 imperm and for backrow 2 twin twister.  My extra is nothing special, two of every Plunder (if u aren´t that good or unexperienced with plunder I recommend to ditch the bijinki and play 3 Blackbeards), 1 Dragite for spell/traps, 1 bahamut +toadally for negates+recursion of toadally, 1 white aura whale good almost board wipe which can be chain blocked by the materials for it (not that good in the current format, u could swap it for masquerina), 1 almiraj for goldenhair shenanigans, 1 bujinki for the 1 abyss dweller.  My side deck shows a wide spread of possible cards which can be used, but I really recommend the Kaijus (good outs for Dragun and attributes for u to use).  If u have better choices or feedback let me know :D"

There are staple cards in the extra-deck to help along the deck and make it more consistent. For example, an easy board to get out is Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 3-4 link materials. This board has 3-4 monster negates and an omni-negate. If you can get even better combos you can extend to things like Borrelsword Dragon and Borreload Savage Dragon. The main combo starter of this deck is Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm which you can get into the grave with cards like Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial to start the board off. Overall this deck is pretty decent but isn't overly good that can be considered top tier. Maybe at best a tier 3-2 deck or rogue deck that can do good at times.

Miradora, Skywing of the Whirlwind)","A Speedroid deck and a poor example of wordplay. I hadn't really played Speedroid in a while, so when I realized that Miradora, Skywing of the Whirlwind is a thing, I decided to make this. This is more of a go-second deck, thanks to the 9 hand traps (Including the three Miradoras) and the Lightning Storms and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  As for Miradora itself, it's a pretty iffy card. Firstly, yes, it's good that its effects and their activations can't be negated. But you can only summon it if the monster your opponent summoned from the Extra Deck has at least 2000 ATK. So against cards like Invoked Mechaba, Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, and Borreload Savage Dragon, the card is pretty good.  &nbsp;  But against weaker monsters that still have very powerful effects likePredaplant Verte Anaconda, this card is useless. Still, I'm not gonna let an excuse to use Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon go to waste!"

From the time the archetype was originally released up to 2019, the deck was, quite lacking to say the least. The archetype in more pure builds had not much going for it, and required a bunch of generic extenders to get plays going. Then 2019 came along, releasing the Legendary Hero Decks. So far the most recent installment in the Legendary Decks series of products, came with a blessing for the PK players (or at least the people who like PK), but a curse to practically everyone else, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>. This card was and still is an absolutely insane card that boosted the PK deck immensely to the point that in pure builds the best way to play it was Bardiche turbo. Being able to cover a majority of the PK's major weaknesses as an archetype were fixed, being able to both send a PK monster to the graveyard, and set a PK S/T afterwards. This is where the card gets more insane when you remember the PK's best S/T is a trap card that negates, and being able to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> to fetch another one from the deck. If Bardiche doesn't get negated, you have one free negate on the board just by summoning the damn thing. The craziest thing about <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> is that the card only requires Dark monsters for its summon, being able to be abused by predominantly Dark decks. This is where the best deck at the time, <a data-name=""Orcust"">Orcust</a>, comes in. Orcust was a powerful beast of a deck in 2019 with major consistency and <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a>, being able to stack the PK's newfound power on top of it, along with another insanely powerful card at the time, <a data-name=""Outer Entity Azathot"">Outer Entity Azathot</a> (basically the VFD of 2019, when being summoned by <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>, also settable through Bardiche btw), It became too much of a trouble where Konami pulled a <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> FTK format and didn't hit the actual enablers of these plays until January 2020, Banning <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a>, the main consistency booster of Orcust, <a data-name=""Bardiche"">Bardiche</a>, for being an insane splashable tool, and Azathot, to let people play the game again. (Oh and the rest of the 2019 meta, everything got banned), Fast forward to September 2020, Konami decided to bring back The <a data-name=""Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, to help hype up the upcoming set in November 2020, Phantom Rage, which came with some new Phantom Knights support, which has not only made the purer builds of PK more menacing, but also boosted the power enough to make the deck a rouge competitor in the meta today! <h2>Deck List:</h2> <h4>The Phantom Knights</h4> 3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>: This is the best piece of support the Phantom Knights archetype got in Phantom Rage and for good reason, It's both a starter card, and an extender card. This is a card that you want to play 3 of as much as you can in any PK deck, its insane versatility and reliability as a card in the deck makes it a permanent 3 of in every form of PK.  3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>:  3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>:  2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>:  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>: <h4>The Other Monsters</h4> 3 <a data-name=""Marauding Captain"">Marauding Captain</a>: This is the second of your 3 normal summons in the deck, being able to turbo out another monster on summon making easy cherubini plays is really, really nice to have. Not every build must play this, but it's one that's used in a lot of builds for it's generi use. A classic card,.remembering the days of GOAT format when this thing was at 2 to make the battle lock less consistent, now that effect of Marauding Captain doesn't come up often nowadays, it's still something to take note of.  3 <a data-name=""Tour Guide from The Underworld"">Tour Guide from The Underworld</a>: The 3rd main normal summon of the deck, has the same first effect as marauding captain but it's type specific but allows you to not need the target you want in hand, it's a duality that is nice to remember, Marauding summons in from hand with only lv restriction, Tour Guide summons from hand or deck with both a type and lv restriction.  2 <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: This is the main target you want to summon off of Tour Guide, not drawing into Tour Guide is still not much of an issue if you can still make <a data-name=""Cherubini"">Cherubini</a> to send this card to get it's effect off. Playing 2 of it is ideal because if you draw into it as a 1 of, your combos will require more resources, and playing it at 3 is not ideal in this build since you don't necessarily want to draw into it outside of PK Fire.  2 <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: This is the target you want to summon off of Graff. Also playing 2 for the same reasons and it's also a harder garnet than Graff if you play it at 1.  1 <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of The Burning Abyss</a>: The card you want to summon off of Graff if you go second instead of Cir to help clear up your opponent's board of a troublesome card during your combo. Don't need to run 2 as you aren't always going second, and that it's not entirely dead in hand.  ,3 <a data-name=""Kagemucha Knight"">Kagemucha Knight</a>: The best extender in the deck, if you draw this with any other monster, you practically just have a free Cherubini to start off your combos. (It can also chain block your Tour Guide against ash which is really helpful but not insane as imperm is still a card, but even then you still have the materials to go into Cherubini so it wouldn't matter too much.)  1 <a data-name=""Psychic Traker"">Psychic Traker</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a>: You can definitely play more of these if you want but I prefer the Danger!? package because of it's draw power.  1 <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackelope?"">Danger!? Jackelope?</a> &amp; Danger!? Tsuchinoko?: This little Danger!? package is really nice to play in the deck as they are dark lv 3 monsters that special summon themselves while also setting up the graveyard, albeit randomly, that also draw a card on their summon, play 3 of these if they ever go back to 3.  1 <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>: Garnets in every sense of the word, only played in here for the Dragoon engine, an engine that is really helpful in PK as PK can't play through negation as easily as decks like VW or Infernobles.  1 <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a>: Gamma fodder and that's it. <h4>Spells</h4> 1 Reinforcement of The Army: One of the most famous cards in the game and for good reason, generic searching fro any warrior monster you need is really helpful.  1 Foolish Burial:  1 Emergency Teleport:  1 Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force:  1 Red-Eyes Fusion: <h4>Traps</h4> 3 Phantom Knights' Fog Blade: <h4>, Hand Traps</h4> 3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring:  3 Infinite Impermanence:  3 Psy-Framegear Gamma:  (Im going to finish writing this i swear =-=)"

""Digital Bugs"" are often labeled as the test version for the ""Zoodiac"" archetype, since they use their archetypal monsters to stack into other monsters at their disposal. They are, however, a lot weaker due to overall weaker effects, the need for Xyz materials to start Xyz climbing and the focus on position changing. Nonetheless, they gained a support card in <em>Blazing Vortex</em> that helps immensely and makes them a fun little deck that can actually use its gimmick to full effect.</p> <p>Due to their restrictiveness in summoning by asking for specific Attribute/Type combinations, you will have to run quite a lot of the archetype's monsters. I run three ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Resistrider"">Digital Bug Resistrider</a>"", which is an amazing support card that can manipulate levels, Special Summon itself when a Level 3 Insect monster is Normal Summoned and allows for position changing which benefits the overall strategy. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Centibit"">Digital Bug Centibit</a>"" summons monsters from the deck and allows the Xyz monster this monster is material of to attack all opposing defense position monsters. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>"" changes positions, Special Summons Level 3 Insects from the hand and makes defense values 0 when used as Xyz material. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug LEDybug"">Digital Bug LEDybug</a>"" searches and allows Xyz monsters to draw cards whenever they destroy monsters in battle. ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Cocoondenser"">Digital Bug Cocoondenser</a>"" is primarily used as a monster revive.</p> <p>Non-archetypal monsters include ""<a data-name=""Galaxy Worm"">Galaxy Worm</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>"", which provide easily summonable and self-searching Level 3/Level 5 monsters, ""<a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>"" as surprising ATK boosts, ""<a data-name=""Bachibachibachi"">Bachibachibachi</a>"" to deal trample damage when used as Xyz material and ""<a data-name=""Mirror Ladybug"">Mirror Ladybug</a>"" as an additional Special Summon.</p> <p>The backrow is pretty straightforward: ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" clear front and backrow respectively, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" is a useful draw option that does not really deal any damage to the overall consistency since every necessary card is at three, three ""<a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>"" allows your Xyz monster to dodge certain targeting effects and serves as the ""Digital Bug"" Rank-Up. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Bug Emergency"">Bug Emergency</a>"" can provide additional monsters for Xyz summons while also giving you an easier time summoning higher ranked monsters, three ""<a data-name=""Stumbling"">Stumbling</a>"" trigger summoning effects of ""Digital Bug"" monsters while providing some field control and lastly two ""<a data-name=""Curse of Anubis"">Curse of Anubis</a>"" to have position changing on reaction. I also included ""<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" to potentially stop opposing plays.</p> <p>The Extra Deck looks as follows: Three ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Scaradiator"">Digital Bug Scaradiator</a>"" are absolutely necessary for climbing, beatdown and useful effect negation, two ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a>"" have grown on me since they do actually work quite well and one ""<a data-name=""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"">Digital Bug Rhinosebus</a>"" as a finisher/beatdown option. Going into ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>""/""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"" is a useful option that can be opted into rather often, ""<a data-name=""Inzektor Exa-Stag"">Inzektor Exa-Stag</a>"" is another Rank-Up option, while ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" is backrow removal. The deck included one ""<a data-name=""Number 20: Giga-Brilliant"">Number 20: Giga-Brilliant</a>"" which was a worst-case-scenario option, but after some feedback I included a copy of ""<a data-name=""Number 3: Cicada King"">Number 3: Cicada King</a>"" for being an absolute god-send that interacts with the ""Digital Bug"" archetype in various ways. The Link monsters consist of ""<a data-name=""Inzektor Picofalena"">Inzektor Picofalena</a>"" for small stat boosts, deck thinning and card draw, ""<a data-name=""Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon"">Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon</a>"" for Special Summoning, ""<a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>"" as an improved backrow remover and ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" for all the useful things the monster does.</p> <p>This ""Digital Bug"" build is certainly not the end-all-solution to what can be done with this archetype. However, I think this is a valid start. If you have ideas, feel free to comment, and if you want to read some more about the ""Digital Bug"" archetype you can visit the archetype analysis for them following this link: https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/archetype-analysis-digital-bug/</p>"

No Problem! Behold my Funny Numbers deck! I can assure you that they will die a quick overwhelming death ;) by","Hello fellow Yu-Gi-Oh! Players. Did you just accidentally wanted to search for boring Meta decks but somehow got into my shitty side; then well what a welcome suprise. This deck is one of the simplest and funniest decks that you have ever seen. I have run a countless amounts of tests and I say that it is a deck that kills fast and efficient (if they don't play magic zylinder). But don't take my word. Take the words of our specialists called my friends (just kiddin, I have no friends ) and if you like it or support those braindead idea of mine, just leave a like or comment something for me to know so that I can post more of those abominations. And if you have questions about this deck, just comment bellow and i'll answer them as quick as possible.  How the deck works is simple. Even me monke brain understands this. Effektive Going 1st and 2nd, be assured that you're opponents will die as easy as possible by beating them with some 20k beatsticks for you being able to have lunch while otheres are sweating to win the match. And the best thing is that it is cheap. I made this deck as cheap as possible for you guys so that even the brokest of people (me included) can afford a competetive meta deck. I am talking to the brokest of the broke, the people that want to have the most fun with the least money to dab on the corpses of the meta players that paid hundreds and hundreds of dollars for crappy cardboard. *dab* And for the rich people out there that play gucci or louis vuitton there are some extra variants that you can play by putting your average op cards in it. Without further a do let's get right into it.  What's the strat?  Firstly be a gentleman and ask them whether they want going first or second. For you it doesn't matter but going 2nd is most of the time funnier because you can then run them over with your beatsticks.  Rules and Card effects are:  Try to get network resolving at all costs.  You can summon only one monster after network is resolved(but you can set 1 extra)  Always throw the kaiju at the opponents side before activating network.  You can only activate network if you control now monsters.  Psychic Fervor must be the last chain if not you'll die from Lp loss.  All your numerons cards get banished if they were not used for summon material in end phase.  Don't summon more monsters than neccessary to otk because of network and nibiru can screw you up longtime.  If you activate Kaiju slumber give yourself  the Light machine one first before giving the other one the normal light thunder one.  Going 1st you usually just summon 3 gates out of network to avoid nibiru and then go into zexal (a cheap trick for a cheap deck). and try to resolve gamma by negating a handtrap or activating Hope to draw additional cards to otk your opponents next turn with your drawn cards. Or just summon Inspector Boarder, set and pass. Works almost every time.  Going 2nd you usually make it a little bit more interesting. Firstly you have to get rid of the problematic monsters. If you drew a kaiju and your opponents summoned a monster just tribute the one that negates and then activate the eff of numeron network. No worries you'll draw it I made sure that this deck is filled of to the brimm with cards that search it and if not just resolve mystic mine (teeheehee). The strat is to bring out the gates because, if you haven't figured out yet. It's skystriker. ok ok I'll stop. Almost all of the monsters this deck has are light and machines what makes them perfect targets for having otk potential by activating Limiter removal, Psychic-Fervor, Honest or vic viper t301. The trick is to get the atk of your monsters on field as high as possible. The effect that boosts atk the least must be activated as the latest chain so that the atk will be as high as possible. And if you have problems getting over monsters or fear of backrow you can always use your extradeck. Mekk knight astram being a light with the eff to gain atk when attacking a special summoned monster (Kaiju *cough cough*) and Megaclops being machine make them viable with the doubling atk cards so that they will ensure you to kill them in one turn. And if you have kaiju slumber and two cards that boosts atk for example honest and limiter remover your monster's atk will get up to 13200atk which will roll over your opponents monster with ease.  The rest is self-explanatory.  Bonus for the ones reading this far:  You can spice this budget deck up by putting money cards in it to make it even better but more expensive. I would highly suggest putting magicians souls(with dogmatika fleur de lis) to get rid of unnecassary copys of network in your hand. This card will also allow you to play relinquished anima. Effect veiler although not expensive will also allow you to go into needlefiber and then selene and with the spells you discarded threw souls you'll be able to summon access code talker that is in itself a beast. A perfect addition to the main would also be forbidden droplet which in bonus of negation, reduces the opponents atk. Don't forget AA Zeus after overlaying into zexal and stunning your opponents. Guess what? Zeus is Light-Machine! And where should I begin with the side? Lightningstorm and so on and so on...  And if you came this far let me tell you a secret. Did you know that the Invoked Engines bossmonsters Invoked Mechaba is a Light Machine?!?! and that aleister has a effect that further doubles the atk? If you like me to show you the Invoked version of the deck let me know in the comments. Wish you a happy 2021!  Edit: HOLY FUCK! HOLY FUCK! I just realized now that Drytrons are LIGHT-MACHINE. How come I have just noticed yet. So now you can choose from Invoked, Numeron and Drytron-Light-Machine OTK! I'll probably make one Invoked and Drytron one sooner or later. I look forward to it. See ya!!!"

(artimyle sucks btw)  just a way, to full on attack the main weakness is monster effects, cause with lady in wight in graveyard its unnefected by battle or trap/spell effects.  so yes monster effects can counter this deck but not enough to destroy it. this is a way to catch someone offguard leaving even a 4000 atk monster in attack still being aable to win."

The deck is semi-competitive and you might brick some times (for me it happens in 1 out of 10 duels so it's not terrible).  You would ussualy go first and hope your opponent doesn't have a way to stop your plays. A great opening hand is Crimson Resonator + level 4 non-Tuner monster. Special Summon Crimson, then summon non-Tuner, go into Red Rising, revive Crimson and then use Crimson's effect to summon more tuner and go into other plays.  The deck has some decent field destruction, effect negation and A LOT of beatsticks. I put Red Supernova because it's just a very fun combination of beatstick and negation, but you can put whatever you want,e though you can can summon it on first turn to flex on opponent ;)  Most of spells and traps are there due to my personal prefrences and you can change them, but you should keep at least 2 Resonator Calls, 2 Resonator Commands and 2 Iron-scrap Signals."

","40 card infernoble deck, using armageddon knight and plague spreader. Also using the deskbot auroadon combo. Cut the genba out, and the chalice to 2 bc i really wanted to make the profile 40 cards. The deck can play through certian handtraps like ash and imperm, but the deck loses to nibiru more often now. This isn't a problem because right now there is no deck that beats every hand trap. So if you are scarred to play any deck bc it loses to one hand trap you should just play a different game lol no side deck currently bc I have only played it online in singles. When i test it on remote duels and irl i will add a side deck. Also the deck has good one card/ two card combos that end on nasty boards, but also it has its own bricks, but any deck can brick. The bricks are not terrible you can play thru one brick bc plague spreader can put one card back into the deck, but drawing two of them makes it tougher, and you just need to use your brain to figure out a play. Also since i cut genba if you draw two of the one off equip spells you cannot do full combo, so adding genba is not a terrible idea if you want to have a back up play incase you do draw that. Also extra deck is pretty standard, except the abomination, i like it bc the charles abom synergy is ridilous but you can switch it for any other card maybe appolusa or accescode talker. Also the phantom in the side deck is for a hand loop combo i will show in a video. ALSO HAND TRAPS CAN BE CHANGED IF YOU OWN TTT PLAY IT INSTEAD OF LANCEA ITS BETTER BUT pick handtraps that fit ur meta and what decks you play against."

Zoodiac-Zeus  just couldn't stand up to the metagame and it just couldn't play the slow game - something a control deck is supposed to be good at, it burns it resources too early. For this reason I am using both the Dogmatika and Eldlich cards to do this job. This deck and play both the 1st and seconds game, is very consistent and has only 1 brick in the form of driver. Going first it can set up a multiple negate board and going second Zeus can wreak everything. This deck can end on Drident, 2 pops, a monster negate and multiple backrow going first. Going second you can make Zeus with multiple materials, and also use cards like gamma to counter VFD and use golden lord as removal. This deck is a solid pick for the metagame and can also counter most meta decks. The side deck was designed to answer all the top tier meta decks as of now. Also make sure to answer the poll question down below!  &nbsp;  For in in depth deck explanation and combo tutorial check out my youtube video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFtcBVAZxGo&amp;t=8s</a>  &nbsp;  Thanks and I'll see you next time! :D"

This time, Invoked Volcanics, even though they have no synergy and this deck makes no fucking sense. You’re welcome, fuckers.</span><span> </span><span>This guide took me, like, two days, and i’m exhausted and i want to die. Also, credit to my boy RATA for his vid that helped me with this.</span><span> </span><span>                                <span>         </span></span><span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Rocket- Rocket is a key card of the deck, as it searches the Accelerator spell/trap line up for your plays, as the Accelators are essential. Although, it does take up the summon which you would normally like to use for Aleister, so. </span><span> </span><span>3x Scattershot- Scattershot gives a miniscule amount of burn damage to the opponent, although that’s not the most important part of Scattershot. Scattershot, when it’s sent to the grave, sends 2 more copies of Scattershot to the grave, which inflict burn 500 more burn damage. This stacks up to 1500, which is pretty meaty, and sets up the grave for more plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Shell- Shell is another important card for the deck, as you want to shit it out to the grave to infict a tiny amount of burn from the guns. Afterwards, you’ll want to use Shell’s effect to get more Shells, providing a ton of more fodder to shoot off with the guns. </span><span> </span><span>2x Counter- Counter is a pretty nice card as a surprise against the opponent, as you can dump it and the opponent’ll probably not read it and forget about it. When they swing in on you, you can use Counter to inflict a fuck ton of burn damage considering how high the modern stats are. Although, Counter is mandatory, so it can be creeped out with the smallest monster on the opponent’s board, so remember that.</span><span> </span><span>2x Agnizinmaud- However you spell it, the True King thingy is really good at getting a body on board and monsters in the grave. It can get itself onto the board without taking up the normal summon, which is great for this deck as it can struggle to get large bodies on board. Additionally, he props the effects of your Volcanics, since he destroys them (which sends them to the grave) for cost. Additionally, on summon, he gets non-targeting banishing, which is amazing.</span><span> </span><span>3x Royal Firestorm Guards- Royal Firestorm Guards mainly serve to recycle your resources and is your main source of draw power. You constantly shit out monsters non-stop into the grave, so Firestorm recycles them for later plays, and gives you a  great draw 2 to extend your plays. Firestorm does take up your normal summon though, so you do have to be careful with it and Aleister.</span><span> </span><span>3x Aleister- Aleister is a key part of the Invoked engine, as it’s the main material of all of the Invoked fusions. Additionally, you mainly want to normal summon it if you don’t have an Invocation in hand already, so you can search invocation. Although, if you did draw into Invocation, you don’t need to normal summon Aleister, leaving your normal summon free for Rocket and Firestorm. Aleister can be bricky sometimes, but is worth it because of the strength of the Invoked engine.</span><span> </span><span>3x Gamma- Gamma is the deck’s main handtrap, as it’s an omni-negate for monsters. Gamma is really important in the current meta as it can negate VFD and the such, which is insanely important in the current meta for, y’know, not dying. Gamma also gets a body on board. The main problem of Gamma is that it requires a brick just to use it,  which is a pain in the ass. </span><span> </span><span>1x Driver- Driver is, basically a shitty garnet thats just for Gamma. You want to keep it in the deck, as it’s a pain in the ass to draw into. </span><span> </span><span>2x Blaze Accelerator- Blaze Accelerator isn’t very good due to how restrictive it is, meaning you’ll want to just use it and then send it to the grave in order to activate  Tri-Blaze. Blaze Accelerator can still be used in emergency situations, though.</span><span> </span><span>2x Tri-Blaze- Tri-Blaze is mainly used to send Blaze, and then activate it. Tri-Blaze is great for filling up your grave with Pyro’s (with way less restrictions than Blaze), and it gives non-targeting destruction. It also gives a small amount of burn damage, but coupled with Scattershot it comes to 2000, which is a big number for burn. </span><span> </span><span>3x Invocation- Invocation is an amazing card for the Invocation engine, as you can use monsters from your hand, graveyard, or the opponent’s grave. This is great, as you can fill up the grave with more Volcanics if you’re making a Purgatrio, or you can make literally anything else using the opponent’s bullshit.</span><span> </span><span>2x Meltdown- Meltdown searches Aleister whenever you need it, although i’ve found in playtesting that you rarely need Meltdown due to the three of Aleister, so I cut Meltdown down to 2. Meltdown also gives your fusion summons protection, but thats not as notable. </span><span> </span><span>3x Foolish Burial Goods- Foolish Burial Goods is mainly used to send Reload to the grave, for it’s great grave effect.</span><span> </span><span>1x Foolish Burial- Foolish Burial is mainly used for sending shit like Scattershot to the grave in order to activate their effects, and it sends them for no cost, and without the iffy requirements of stuff like the Blaze Accelerators. </span><span> </span><span>1x Instant Fusion- Instant Fusion is mainly used for getting out Raidjin, so you can flip down the opponent’s main source of negates to either A) Bait out their negate, or B) completely rid the negates.</span><span> </span><span>3x Reload- Reload’s on field effect effect is fairly solid, as it allows you to ditch a Volcanic (triggering their GY effect and filling up the GY), and draw 1, which is amazing for generating tons of advantage. Due to this being a trap, though, this is insanely slow and annoying to use. It’s grave effect is what is special about Reload, though. You’re able to banish Reload from the grave to send a Volcanic from d e c k, which is amazing, as you don’t need to use your hand. This is great, as it fills up your grave and triggers things like Scattershot without having to use resources from your precious hand.</span>  <span>The extra deck</span>  <span>2x Caliga- Caliga is a great floodgate to end the turn off of on, as you can pass with it and make sure the opponent can’t rebuild their board. Due to how common the Dark attribute is on a ton of decks, it’s fairly easy to make it with the opponent’s cards.</span><span> </span><span>1x Raidjin- Raidjin is mainly summoned off of Instant Fusion, and it’s used to bait out negates, since you can summon it and attempt to flip down the opponent’s negation boss monster. They’ll be forced to either have it flip down, or use their negate on Raidjin, which can save your plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the deck’s main Invoked monster, as since you mainly use  Fire monsters, you can get out Purg consistenstenly. Purgatrio is basically a big, strong beater, and a fun card in general to use.</span><span> </span><span>1x Cocytus- Cocytus is mainly used for just, being a big wall that can lightly poke at the opponent sometimes. Cocytus is rarely summoned, only in certain match ups or situations. </span><span> </span><span>2x Augo- Augo is mainly a large body mid- to late game, as you can get some removal with it and then it grows to be a big beater, which is great for closing off games.</span><span> </span><span>3x Mechaba- Mechaba is another amazing monster in the deck, as it’s the deck’s main source of negations. Mechaba also sends cards from your hand directly to the grave, which triggers the effects of the Volcanics, making Mechaba stack up value. </span><span> </span><span>3x Elysium- Elysium is mainly just a big boss monster for late game, as it’s a large 32k beater that can provide non-targeting banishing removal, which is amazing in the current meta.</span><span> </span><span>The side deck</span>  <span>3x Volcanic Queen- Volcanic Queen is a great card, as it’s basically a kaiju with extra effects. While it’s on the opponent’s field, it forces them to tribute monsters or take 1000 damage, which is great for the Volcanic playstyle. It’s mainly just in the side due to certain match ups and such.</span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- Ash, you know what Ash does. It’s in the side deck because there was no space in the main. </span><span> </span><span>3x D.D Crow- See above.</span><span> </span><span>3x Lightning Storm- Lightning Storm is a great card for clearing fields when going 2nd.</span><span> </span><span>3x Imperm- Imperm is mainly used for negating scary monsters when going 2nd.</span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span><span> </span><span>So, this is mainly a going second burn deck. You’ll want to opt to go second, as this deck dies going first. Immediately activate your Blaze Accelerators, so you can send your Volcanics to clear the opponent’s field and inflict a ton of burn damage (if you’re using Scattershot.) You’ll also want to use your normal summon after that, either normal summoning Rocket to fill the gaps in your hand, or Aleister to nab you a Invocation. Then, you’ll want to turbo into either Purgatrio or  Mechaba, and hopefully use Reload for more effects. From there, swing in with Purg or whichever fusion you got, and if the game wasn’t closed off in that turn, finish burning them to death on turn 2. </span><span> </span><span>Note: A Mystic Mine package might be a nice tech choice, although I haven’t tried that out. </span><span> </span><span>Any suggestions or shit like that is appreciated. Have a good day : )</span>"

I added the timelords because I really think they are OP, <a data-name=""Michion"">Michion</a> for instance, can halve your opponent's life points, raphion works really well if your opponents holds a monster that has high attack power, you can target that monster and inflict life points equal to that monster's attack. Time maiden is used to give you timelords. I added big shield gardna ONLY so the opponent will attack gardna, and the card he would most likely attack gardna with is a card less than gardna's defence. Also, time lords can not be destroyed by battle or be inflicted on, but by the end of your phase and the opponents phase, the timelord gets shuffled back to the Deck. The whole of the Deck is to get enough Ra disciples and the different Ra phases to summon Ra. Trap cards are the core to stalling your opponent, but can be most likely countered which is one of the main reasons why we have the Time lords here. I added alexandrite dragon as another choice for summoning, if you want to get rid of low level monsters with effects which can eventually build up to higher monsters. You can also see Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring x3, and effect veiler x2, which are used to get rid of your opponents effects. Finally we have draw cards such as Pot of duality, and Upstart goblin."

The basic concept is that Blazeman is a normal summon that allows you to grab a fusion spell, similar to how Alesiter can help bolster the consistency of Shaddoll in the Invoked variant. Blazeman can also turn into either a Light or Water attribute in this deck, making him a genuine swiss army knife for the Shaddoll archetype. There has been some thought to adding Shadowmist as well to give access to the Dark attribute, but it felt like too much of a brick.  Liquidman and Honest Neos let you turn your Emergency Call into different attributes, as well as having useful effects of their own. The synergy between Liquidman and the Shaddolls is quite good. Neos is mostly just a tutor target, but he can be useful at cracking over your opponents Windas or whatnot with Blazeman or Liquidman.  Everything else is pretty standard Shaddoll. We have the full Shaddoll combo package as well as some tech like Gameceil (who also doubles as an outlet for Absolute Zero). The extra deck could probably be better optimized, this is just what I've landed on for now.  Any feedback is appreciated!"

But, due to a number of missing hard once-per-turns, there is a lot of room for creativity. From crazy boards full of negates to full-out hand loops, Infernity has a lot of potential.  <span>Combo</span>  So Infernity may seem a bit complicated to the average player. Most Infernity lists you see are probably going to look a lot different than this one, mainly because they have different end-goals than my list. But before you can begin to understand this list, you must know the combo. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this combo, tell me in the comments. Do note that this deck does require a bit of a brain. Depending on your opening hand and <strong>Saryuja</strong> draws, you may need to adjust the combo as you go.  So the beginning is non-linear. The first thing you need to do is get both <a data-name=""Infernity Archfiend"">Infernity Archfiend</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Necromancer"">Infernity Necromancer</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a> does a very good job at helping out at this, so you'll typically have him on-field as well by the time the combo starts. Once you have gotten the set-up, you need to hope that you opened one of the following cards: <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, <a data-name=""Charge into a Dark World"">Charge into a Dark World</a>, and/or <a data-name=""ZERO-MAX"">ZERO-MAX</a>. These reborn cards are essential to starting up the combo. If anyone knows of any other reborn cards the deck can use (note we can't use stuff like <a data-name=""Living Fossil"">Living Fossil</a> because we need the monster to be able to activate its effect and go back to the GY) then please tell me in the comments. Now with that out of the way, let's get into the actual combo. <ol>  	<li>Revive <strong>Necromancer</strong> with a reborn card, revive <strong>Archfiend</strong> from <strong>Nerco's</strong> effect</li>  	<li>Search <a data-name=""Infernity Patriarch"">Infernity Patriarch</a>, summoning him from hand</li>  	<li>Overlay into <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> using <strong>Archfiend</strong> and <strong>Patriarch</strong></li>  	<li>Revive <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Launcher"">Infernity Launcher</a></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Launcher</strong>, but do not use its effect yet</li>  	<li>Make a 4-mat <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a></li>  	<li>Now, to continue you are going to hope that you draw into another reborn card. Thankfully, with all of the searching and milling you have already done, you have a high chance of nabbing one of the 10 in your deck. This reliance on reborn cards is one of the reasons the deck still needs more support. However, the odds are in your favor</li>  	<li>Revive <strong>Necro</strong>, bring back <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and search <a data-name=""Infernity Avenger"">Infernity Avenger</a></li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Avenger</strong> through <strong>Saryuja's</strong> effect</li>  	<li>Make <strong>Saryuja</strong> again, grab another reborn</li>  	<li>Bring back <strong>Necro</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> revives <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Mirage"">Infernity Mirage</a></li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Mirage</strong> through <strong>Saryuja</strong>, tributing him for <strong>Avenger</strong> + <strong>Patriarch</strong></li>  	<li>Make <a data-name=""Hundred Eyes Dragon"">Hundred Eyes Dragon</a> using <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and <strong>Necro</strong></li>  	<li>Banish <strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Hundred Eyes</strong> effect, tributing <strong>Hundred</strong> for <strong>Necro</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Barrier"">Infernity Barrier</a> 1</li>  	<li>Using <strong>Saryuja</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong>, make <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> for <a data-name=""Infernity Wildcat"">Infernity Wildcat</a></li>  	<li>Overlay <strong>Wildcat</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong> into <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a>, bring back <strong>Mirage</strong></li>  	<li>Use <strong>Sea Dragon</strong>, <strong>Patriarch</strong>, <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and <strong>Noodle</strong> for <strong>Saryuja </strong>(what you draw here doesn't really matter. If you get lucky and get another reborn card/extender you may be able to add another negate to your end board)</li>  	<li>Tribute <strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Avenger</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <strong>Barrier</strong> 2</li>  	<li>Make <strong>Hundred</strong> again using <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong>, and <strong>Archfiend </strong></li>  	<li><strong>Hundred Eyes</strong> banishing <strong>Mirage</strong>, tributing him to summon <strong>Avenger</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Wildcat</strong>, make <strong>Sea Dragon</strong>, detaching <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Mirage</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Nerco</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong></li>  	<li>Search <strong>Necro</strong> 2</li>  	<li><strong>Saryuja</strong> to summon <strong>Necro</strong> 2 from hand</li>  	<li><strong>Archfiend</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> 1 (the one that already used its effect/the one you didn't just search), <strong>Sea Dragon,</strong> and <strong>Saryuja</strong> for <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> 2 brings back <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <strong>Barrier</strong> 3, use them and <strong>Avenger</strong> to make <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, attaching <strong>Saryuja</strong>. While we could make a <a data-name=""Void Ogre Dragon"">Void Ogre Dragon</a> here, there isn't much of a need as <strong>Savage</strong> does everything he does. You may argue that <strong>Void Ogre</strong> destroys, but the ruling is if you negate the activation of a Spell/Trap, then the card is sent to the GY by game mechanic even if it wasn't destroyed. And since this is inferring you are going first, as the deck does going second, your opponent shouldn't have any cards on the field to begin with</li>  	<li>Send <strong>Launcher</strong> to the GY for <strong>Necro</strong> 1 and <strong>Necro </strong>2, <strong>Necro</strong> 1 for <strong>Avenger</strong>, making <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, and <strong>Necro</strong> 2 for <strong>Wildcat</strong>, making <a data-name=""Infernity Doom Archfiend"">Infernity Doom Archfiend</a> (must be in ATK Position to make your 3 <strong>Barriers</strong> live)</li> </ol> Funny enough, I think that if all of these cards were legal in Master Rule 4, the entire combo would still be possible (correct me if I'm wrong). Not that it means much, just thought it was interesting.  (Note that with an extra extender, you may be able to make that same board, but with a Void Ogre Dragon alongside it.)  <span>Ratios</span>  So a basic overview of the ratios, I won't go into full detail, just a quick brush over. So excluding the combo pieces above, we have tons of triple-axis tools, because we really need to make <strong>Cherubini</strong>. You may have noticed <a data-name=""Performapal Hip Hippo"">Performapal Hip Hippo</a>. That is for our secret meta-destroying spice, <a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>. An <strong>E-Tele</strong> that can summon from hand, deck, or GY, meaning <strong>Hip Hippo</strong> is never a garnet, just a dead draw, and in addition to a lack of a once-per-turn clause allows you to activate all three copies in the duel, sometimes in the same turn. That should be it for the monsters. The only traps of the deck are searchable during the combo so that just leaves the spell cards. <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>, <a data-name=""Void Apocalypse"">Void Apocalypse</a>, and <a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a> all help in making <strong>Cherubini</strong>. <strong>Launcher</strong> is arguably the strongest card in your deck, searchable in the combo. And the rest is your reborn cards which are essential to the combo.  Now let's talk about the Extra Deck. Everything except your bosses, <strong>Savage</strong>, <strong>Ogre</strong>, <strong>Herald</strong>, and <strong>Apollousa </strong>is set in stone. Unless you come up with a different combo, those bosses are the only things you can change. If you can think of anything better than these bosses (2 Level 8 Synchros, a Level 4 Synchro, and a Link-4 for going first) tell me in the comments.  <span>Strengths &amp; Flaws</span>  So the endboard looked pretty good. Infernity is a really fun deck to play, and there are several different combo lines you could adapt. Typically, your end board is essentially an FTK. Usually, Infernity is used as a board-building monstrosity. But don't worry, it isn't unbeatable. First of all, going second is almost a death sentence. Secondly, hand traps hurt. If your opponent fires them too early before the combo began, then you may stand a chance depending on the number of extenders you have available. But if they hit you during the combo, then you are kind of dead. Another big thing is consistency, which is why I am considering <a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>, for the consistency boost, GY set-up, and the ability to bait hand traps such as <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. As stated earlier, this deck struggles at using the meta generic staples that most other decks can. The only hand traps you can really run are sided in for when you know you are going second, or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for its ability to be set and out of your hand. Other than that, you are out of luck. Lastly, the end board isn't unbeatable. Spell Speed 4 effects such as <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> work great against your deck. The ability to simply get rid of the Attack Position Infernirty (whether through battle or those SS4 effects) on your to invalidate your <strong>Barriers</strong> and make your board worthless through a single <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>. But despite these flaws, I highly recommend the deck for anyone interested. Lots of rogue decks suffer these same weaknesses, so it shouldn't be news to most people (unless you only ever play what's meta for the current format, and never touch anything below that: which is fine too, I guess).  <span>Banlist &amp; Support</span>  So, as you may know, <a data-name=""Infernity Archfiend"">Infernity Archfiend</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Launcher"">Infernity Launcher</a> are both limited. <strong>Archfiend</strong> had literally no reason to stay on the list, been of he came to 3 you may run a second for stuff like <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> (maybe you would put in the side?). But in reality, <strong>Archfiend</strong> to 3 wouldn't really do anything.  <strong>Launcher</strong> on the other hand would raise the ceiling of the deck to hand loop 5 and sit behind 3 omni-negates, very consistently and with a lot of resilience against several hand traps, with the exception of <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> and <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>. Those 2 can stop you in your tracks.  What about the support? You may have noticed that <a data-name=""Infernity Conjurer"">Infernity Conjurer</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Suppression"">Infernity Suppression</a> are very solid cards. Why don't we run them? We don't run them because we don't run enough Infernity cards. That's right. We don't have enough Infernoty cards in an Infernity deck. We don't have enough play starters for either, something the new support did not give us. By the time <strong>Suppression</strong> is live, you are already performing the combo, where it's anti-hand trap prowess would be too late. Hopefully, Konami gives the archetype more support in the near future so that we can use some of these cards to the fullest.  <span>Closing Remarks</span>  Well done for reading this far (considering that you are a Yu-Gi-Oh player, and most of the player base is semi-illiterate). If you have any suggestions, tell me in the comments section. The side deck is currently just a bunch of ideas I want to test out. So I'll close off with this: <ul>  	<li>I will be updating my horrible Eldlich-Nordic into something that has actual synergy, Tri-Brigade Nordic. That should be done in the near future.</li>  	<li>I will also be updating my Plunder list to include combos involving <a data-name=""Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot"">Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot</a>, and a few changes to the list.</li>  	<li>Lastly, I will release a Witchcrafter list in the near future, so be on the look out for that.</li> </ul>"

Myutants don't work as well with Invokeds as Dragonmaids did, but they still do work fairly well. They have a few ranging attributes to use, and Invocation banishes cards, providing more banish fodder. Deck list time. 2x Arsenal- too bricky at 3. Another one of the, like, weird evolved forms that I run at 2. Pretty good in the current meta, considering how it can dodge pog blade, imperm, and the cringe Eldlich trap line up, making Arsenal pretty solid to leave on the field. 2x Mist- i'm seeing a patttern here. I run all the weird evolved forms at 2. Mist gives instant advantage by banishing a card to draw 2 when your opponent activates a effect, which can easily turn into a plus 3 in the right situation.  While it's a bit slow, it's still a solid source of draw power. 2x Beast- Beast is solid. Can't be targeted by monster effects, which dodges Dragoon, Borreload, etc, which is great in the current meta Also negates spell cards by banishing cards, so it gathers advantage and can easily negate key points of the opponent's combo. 3x Aleister- Mandatory for the Invoked engine. Great searcher as well. It takes up a normal summon (sometimes), which can clash with the Myutants (sometimes), but if you open Invocation you don't even need to normal it. Aleister leads to a ton of strong fusions, namely Mechaba for a source of strong negates. 1x GB-88- I personally run 88 at  1, since it's effect to special summon it is awkward and situational and can brick easily depending on the situation. Works well with Cry though. It's also fairly good late game recovery, as if it's summoned during the opponent's turn, it can be tributed to special a banished level 8 Myutant, which is great for recovering advantage and building your board. 3x ST-46- ST-46 is generally a reliable searcher for the Myutants, as it searches a spell/trap on summon.  If you need fusion, you can get a fusion, you can get a cry, etc. This is great for filling in the gaps in your hand and extending your plays. ST-46 also helps greatly with field swarming, as you can tribute it and banish a monster/spell/trap to special a corresponding level 8 Myutant from hand or deck, so that's great for field swarming and building up a strong board. 3x M-05- M-05 searches out all of the Myutant monsters, which is great for also filling in the gaps in your hand and extending your plays greatly, so you can build a strong board. M-05 also has the same secondary effect as ST-46, making it so you can get out two Level 8's to make a huge board. 3x Ash Blossom- ez negate 2x Ghost Ogre- ez destruction 1x Cyberstien- This deck doesn't use it's normal summon a ton, so if you don't need to normal summon an Aleister at the moment, you can normal summon a Cyberstein to cheat out Ultimus without the entire convuluted Cry process.  Banish/fusion fodder otherwise. 3x Magical Meltdown- Meltdown helps a lot with consistency, as you can search out Aleister if you need one. It also gives you some heavy protection onto the fusion summons, avoiding making the fusion summons into a chokepoint. 3x Myutant Evolution Lab- Da archtypel field spell. Evo lab provides an easy special summon that can free up your normal summon for Aleister or Cyber-Stein, which is great for this deck, and a small attack boost. 3x Invocation- Invocation is an amazing card, as it can use nearly any monster for the fusion, leading into tons of strong monsters like Mechaba. Additionally, this provides a ton of banish fodder, as it banishes Aleister and such. 3x Myutant Fusion- Myutant Fusion is the main archetypal fusion spell, as it allows you to provide a ton of banish fodder to go into your fusions. Additionally, if the opponent's activated a hand trap this turn (which they most likely will have considering the current game), you can banish cards from Deck or GY as well, which is amazing for turboing out fusions.The only bad part of Fusion is that it has a retarded hard once per turn on it, making it a bit annoying to use. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming is mainly used for searching out whichever field spell you need at the time, Meltdown or Evo lab. Although, if you don't need either, you can also use Terraforming to bait out hand traps. 1x Set Rotation- Set Rotation is mainly used to set your Meltdowns and Evo Lab to both player's fields (after you use the field spell plays), which is great for halting a ton of field spell relient decks. 3x Myutant Cry- Cry is amazing for getting out Ultimus on the opponent's turn if you couldn't use Fusion, as it allows you to access a ton of different points for the fusion- Banished cards (which you should have a lot of), GY, and field, so you can easily make a huge Ultimus during the opponent's turn for a ton of interruption. Although, like Fusion, Cry has a hard once per turn, meaning no double Ultimus boards that easy. 3x Trap Trick-Trap Trick is a great card for consistency, as it allows you to search out Cry easily, improving the consistency in ""turboing"" out Ultimus greatly. Extra deck 3x Ultimus- Ultimus is generally a huge beater, as 35k is a greatly above average stat line. Additionally, it has a great negate that provides more banish fodder, and generates advantage on destruction. 2x Mechaba- Mechaba is a great source of negates for the deck, as it can negate literally anything and provides a ton of graveyard set up for Cry later on. 3x Synthethis- Synethethis gives a fairly nice pop on summon, although it might not be of use, considering this is a going 1st deck. Syneththis also provides a nice pseudo-negate built in, generally a solid monster to ""rank up"" into Ultimus by fusing it during the opponent's turn, for heavy interruption. 1x Magellanica- Maggeaicialli or however you spell it is generally just a big 3k beater that helps to close off the game in mid to late game. 2x Purgatrio- Another solid beater, Purg grows to big stats to punish swarm decks and can punish things like Guru control with it's piercing damage. 2x Cocytus- Cocytus is mainly just a large, shitty wall, that can poke at the opponent and stall until you get into a better position. 1x Raijin- Built in book of moon, helps to beat over problem monsters. It can also be used to bait out negates, as you can attempt to flip over a negate monster like Borreload. Either they're forced to use up their negate on Raidjin, or have to let it go. 1x Caliga- god i love floodgates Playing guide This won't be super in depth or anything. I've done a bit of play testing, and my main strategy is fairly simple.  If you don't have an Aleitser, activate Meltdown to search one. If you already have one, Meltdown is just usable for Set Rotation. If you didn't activate Meltdown, or after activating Meltdown, activate Evo lab to special summon a monster. Search Evo with terraforming if you don't already have it.  Tribute the small special summoned Myutant (the one that's in the cage) to search either a monster or a spell, while also providing more banish fodder. Afterwards, fusion summon Synthethis using Myutant Fusion, or search a Fusion using 46 if you don't already have one. After fusion summoning Synthethis, use Invocation to get out whatever Invoked fits the current moment attribute wise. Pass turn. During your opponent's turn, activate Cry and use Synthethis to get out Ultimus much easier. Note: I didn't mention it, but throughout this, you can normal summon Cyber Stein or Aleister if neccesary. Cyber Stein is fantastic for cheating out Ultimus, or if you already have Ultimus, you can use it to get out an extra Ultimus or a Synthethis. also note you'll want to go first so you can set up Cry with Trap Trick to get into Ultimus easier. Any feedback or thoughts is appreciated in the comments. Thanks for reading this, have a good day."

This is my first time posting a deck I built so if you have any suggestions or critiques let me know! :D  <b>Monsters:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Beiige: I’ve seen other decks run a single Beiige and work well, but I think this setup in particular has some really good Beiige synergy down the line, particularly with Charge Into a Dark World for setting up your Rank 4 XYZ summon (Utopia line) or the Knightmare link monsters to start breaking your opponent’s board</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Broww: A staple here, just gives you more cards when he’s discarded, which is especially nice when done via Dark Deal to get the extra card</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Snoww: Your Dark World searcher, can also disrupt your opponent’s GY when paired with Dark Deal which is useful against GY combo-oriented decks like Thunder or Chaos</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Grapha: Used to run 2, but his effect is just too powerful and his ability to cycle himself out of the GY while also giving you another use of a Dark World’s discard effect is way too good to pass up on. GY cycling in particular gives him a lot of use bringing out the powerful Rank 8 XYZ summons (of which there are plenty to choose from), giving him even more utility here</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Bigfoot: Excellent all around with board breaking, Level 8 synergy with Trade-In, and just being an easy-to-summon powerhouse at 3k attack. Obvious pick for playsetting</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Chupacabra: A little less obvious of a playset pick, but I think Chupacabra synergizes more with this deck than others I’ve seen of this type given that he’s a Fiend and can be pulled back from the grave OR discarded with Charge, giving you an additional avenue of firing off his powerful GY effect.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Mothman: Just lets you get more cards and discard effects, easy playset</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Nessie: Either a powerful defender, link fodder, or more discard effects</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Ogopogo: This might seem like a weird pick to only run 1 of given how many Rank 8 XYZs I’m running, but I think keeping in the traps as protection for going first is worth the trade-off. Ogopogo is here particularly to synergize with Danger! Response Team, since its GY effect lets you get both a Danger! discard effect and an extra draw</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Thunderbird: Basically the same as Bigfoot without being as big of a powerhouse and board breaking in a different way, still an easy playset pick</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Jackalope: Don’t know if I need to explain this one, excellent for grabbing XYZ or link material</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Tsuchinoko: Same as Jackalope but he uses himself, also he’s a fat snake. Easy include for that alone</span></li> </ul> <b>Spells:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Card Destruction: Any Danger! Dark World deck should be playing this card</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Charge Into a Dark World: I alluded to it before but this card has great synergy with both Beiige and Chupacabra, and Skull Meister if you side him in. Since it doesn’t specify Dark World, you can use it with any Fiend, letting you get at least one special summon and whatever discard effect you want. It unfortunately doesn’t synergize with other Danger! monsters besides Chupacabra, but I think it provides enough reliable XYZ or link setup to be worth it</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Danger! Response Team: Works incredible well with Ogopogo and lets you recycle it into the deck while drawing a card and getting another Danger! discard effect. Also just has a really good primary effect if you need to get rid of an opponent’s targetable monster that can’t be destroyed by effects or is too strong for your hand to deal with</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Pot of Avarice: Easy pick with so many monster discards</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Super Poly: Opponent board breaking, discard effect (only for Danger! monsters since it discards as cost), getting Starving Venom or Mudragon. What’s not to love here?</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Trade-In: I play a lot of good Level 8s here with strong discard effects, so this is a great pick for both getting those powerful effects and getting more cards to work with</span></li> </ul> <b>Traps:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Dark Deal: I don’t see this card too often in these decks and I think it should be. The main weakness of a lot of Danger! Dark World decks is that they’re really bad at going first, but this card helps mitigate that by denying the opponent a normal Spell card while giving you access to the more powerful discard effects, like getting two cards from Broww or breaking GY monster combos with Snoww</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Another way to stave off the problems with going first, this card actually has great synergy with Grapha. Since Grapha can bring himself back from the GY and recycle Dark World discard effects simultaneously, he’s the obvious pick for EEV’s tribute cost. I’ve won entire duels with this card alone and I think it puts in the work to justify being here</span></li> </ul> <b>Extra:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Mudragon: Super Poly target, lets you stave off targeting enemy effects when you change him to Dark</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: The staple Super Poly target</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Dingirsu: Really powerful Rank 8, excellent both on his own and as a setup into Seven Sins. Gets removal when he’s first summoned that avoids enemy effects that happen on destruction and has built-in survival if you’re planning to use him on his own</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 84: Pain Gainer: Not much to talk about with him besides being ranking material into Seven Sins</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 77: Seven Sins: Incredible beatstick that can just wipe an opponent’s entire field. Gets around cards that can’t be destroyed or targeted since it’s a non-targeting banish and will have plenty of survival if you didn’t use any of Dingirsu or Pain Gainer’s material effects. The only issue is he’ll need to stay on the field for a turn to use his banish effect, since he can’t use it turn one if he’s summoned through rank-up, but that’s not too tough since his survival effect isn’t once per turn and he’ll have anywhere from 1-4 uses of it</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 97: Draglubion: This guy’s your setup into the OTK if you can get it. Use him to special summon Number 100 with Number C92 as its material and fire off 100’s effect for a min. 9k attacker. If the combo gets disrupted or you can’t quite get the OTK off, Draglubion also works as Pain Gainer-&gt;Seven Sins fodder if he can survive a turn after using his effect</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 100: Numeron Dragon: The pick you’ll probably want for Draglubion’s special summon, enables quick OTKs especially if you have more than just Draglubion on the field (like if you got Seven Sins or the Rank 4 setup earlier), can swing over just about any monster your opponent can summon, very strong pick overall</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number C92: Heart-eartH Chaos Dragon: Material to attach to Number 100 with Draglubion. His effect doesn’t really work unless he has the specific monster listed on his card as material, so the only thing he’s good for being summoned on his own is he’s unable to be destroyed by battle and he makes your monsters siphon LP when they do battle damage. If your opponent’s run out of other removal options or you’re super low on LP and can get some good hits in this might not be the worst pick, but if you can get good hits in you’re probably in a better spot to just win with Number 100</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy: Another possible pick for Draglubion, his lockdown on enemy Spell cards is insanely effective and makes him a great choice if you can’t get the OTK or see your opponent has some reliance on Spell cards. He can also change an opponent’s attack target, which makes him good at keeping a weaker field member alive like a Level 4 you need a turn to XYZ</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Utopia/Utopia Prime/Utopia the Lightning: The Rank 4 line I use, this is an incredibly strong setup that can easily swing over whatever your opponent might have. Lightning’s effect actually makes it a Dragoon counter since your opponent can’t use effects until the end of the Damage Step, so they can’t negate Lightning’s jump to 5000 ATK. A great powerhouse that’s incredibly easy to set up with this deck</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: This card is a personal favorite of mine. Getting Apollousa and Hope Harbinger out on the field at the same time is an incredibly effective lockdown on your opponent. Her negates are limited based on how many materials you use to summon her, which can be annoying if your opponent has many ways to lead into their combos, but overall she’s still a very strong pick</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Knightmare Phoenix: Easy to summon, Spell/Trap removal, and works as an engine for discard effects from your Main Deck monsters</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Knightmare Unicorn: Also easy to summon and helps get discard effects, but has the added bonus of being non-destructive removal</span></li> </ul> <b>Side:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Skull Meister: GY effects are very strong in YGO today, so Skull Meister is great at staving off things like “when this card is destroyed” effects and blocking your opponent’s combos. Also has good inherent synergy with this deck by being a Level 4 Fiend, meaning he can do his thing as a handtrap and then be recovered by Charge to use as link/XYZ fodder</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Sphere Mode: Enemy board removal, very good if your opponent has strong lockdown combos that require them to have a bunch of monsters on the field (something like Dragoon, Hope Harbinger, and Apollousa)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Twin Twisters: Spell/Trap removal that also triggers Danger! monster effects by discarding them</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Infinite Impermanence: Just one of the best handtraps overall imo</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Galaxy Eyes line: This is another Rank 8 XYZ setup you can use in place of the Dragons or Seven Sins (or the link monsters if you wanna go all in on XYZ), it just felt like overkill to include all three of these in the Extra Deck when there’s a good chance the duel will be over before you can see all three or even two of the combos. The Galaxy-Eyes setup is very powerful though and makes a strong argument for replacing one of the others, this one is just personal preference mostly</span></li> </ul>"

I think these are the best cards for it without changing the way its played but if anybody e,"Search for pacifis with pot of extravagance or upstart goblin or directly search it with terraforming or metaverse then summon megalomasher or gagagigo using unexpected dai or fossil dig. Use skill drain and cold wave to prevent your opponent from playing the game and sea stealth attack to protect pacifis/skill drain or power up phantasm spiral itself. If the opponent is a threat add phantasm spiral traps to stop them and if not add the equip spells (grip) to power up your monsters and special summon as many dragons as your opponent has monsters as long as you can keep destroying them.

So let’s get it started.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>First of all: Why sky striker?</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>     Sky striker was  one of the best decks in Yu-Gi-OH!  history, so much so that it stays one of the best decks of the past 2 years formats , even with severe hits on the banlist ( </span><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole"">Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</a></b><span> and </span><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a></b><span> limited, semi-limited and after limited  </span><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a></b><span>). However its reign ended with the  April1st 2020 banlist, when it was banned now infamous </span><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a></b><b>,</b><span> the heart and soul of the deck.  After that  the  Sky Striker deck vanished from the top tier contenders being now on a mere rogue  deck.</span>  <span>     But now it’s the time. The time for Sky Striker  to shine once more, </span><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a></b><span> and <b></b><b></b><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a></b> are at 3 and the today format ruled by virtual world, zoo eldlich, dino and others monstrosities will see the power of the anime colegial girls once more.</span>  &nbsp;  <b><i>Disclaimers</i></b>  <span>     When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no Access code talker =/. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Starters</i></b></span>  <b>3x </b><b><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye</a></b><span>: This cute girl or your  main starter. She can bring almost every   sky striker monster in your extra deck and makes a good protection for your Links sky striker monsters against destruction, 'cause Raye can bring herself from the GY and link again in another sky striker. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x</b> <b></b><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Sky Striker Ace&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Roze &lt;/b&gt;""><b>Sky Striker Ace</b> <b>-</b><b> Roze </b></a><b>:</b><span> The fearson antagonist of Raye,  Roze can be another great starter for the sky striker link play. The effect that she can be summoned with another sky striker is good, but the effect that she returns to the field when an opponent's monster is removed from the extra monster zone is beyond insane, additionally can also negate the effect of another opponent's monster.

I beat the shit out of Toon with this, so ask her. Anyway, deck guide.</span><span> </span><span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Alpha- Alpha is a key combo piece of the deck, as if you didn’t open Benten (your main playmaker), you can use Alpha to search it anyways and use Benten as fodder for more Drytrons, so you can get enough to go into Aura. </span><span> </span><span>3x Delta- Delta is the deck’s main source of draw power, as it gives a small draw 1. While the draw 1 is minor, it can easily top deck a Drytron to extend your plays. Delta’s main “cost” is minor, as your opponent can expect what you’ll use if you’re playing Drytrons.</span><span> </span><span>2x Zeta- Zeta mainly just serves to get onto the field, as fodder for Aura. Zeta can also search the Ritual spell on occasion if you need it, although this deck doesn’t always need/want the ritual spell.</span><span> </span><span>1x Gamma- Gamma is mainly used just to revive used up Drytrons mid- to late game, as this provides a ton more monsters on field and a ton of advantage for small cost.</span><span> </span><span>3x Diviner- Diviner is one of the deck’s main playmakers. You want to use your normal summon on Diviner, and then use Diviner’s effect to send Trias. Trias then tributes Diviner in the grave to special summon itself, which activates Diviner’s effect to special summon Sprite. You then go into Union Carrier, and then send Union to grave or banish it somehow. Union Carrier should be equipped with Dawn Knight, so Dawn  Knight sends Eva, which gets back Diviner. Then you’ll use Drytrons to go into Auraradon to make a ton of tokens. Then you use Diviner/D.D sprite and the Tokens to turbo into some huge Synchros.</span><span> </span><span>1x D.D Sprite- D.D Sprite is mainly to be searched off of Diviner for Union and/or Synchro plays, but if you opened it, you can use it to banish Union to activate Dawn Knight. </span><span> </span><span>1x Trias- Trias is a huge garnet in hand, as you need it in the deck at all times for Diviner’s effect. While it is in the deck though, you can use Diviner to send it so Trias tributes Diviner, special summoning Trias and activating Diviner’s effect. After that, Trias is mainly fodder for Union Carrier.</span><span> </span><span>1x Dawn Knight- Dawn Knight is mainly a garnet in hand, although it can be used, but you want it to be in deck so you have more space in hand for combo plays. Dawn Knight is mainly equipped to Union so when Union is sent off the field, Dawn Knight can send Eva to extend your plays.</span><span> </span><span>1x Eva- You also mainly want to keep Eva in deck (holy shit why is this deck running so many garnets), to send it to grave off of Dawn Knight. Once it’s sent later in the combo, Eva can be used to give you another Diviner, as a tuner. </span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- Ash is mainly just a staple hand trap in the deck, as it provides key negates during the opponent’s turn so they can’t do shit.</span><span> </span><span>1x Draconids- Draconids is rarely of much use, aside from being tributed. Although, when going second on some occasions, Draconids can be a huge beater with some strong interruption.</span><span> </span><span>2x Herald- Herald is a nice ritual to end off on, as it can tribute Union to activate Dawn, and Herald is a great source of negates to couple with things like Borreload. </span><span> </span><span>3x Benten- Benten is also one of the deck’s key combo pieces, as you want to burn through the copies and tribute them for the Drytrons. If you didn’t open Diviner, you can easily search Diviner with Benten, which is fantastic. </span><span> </span><span>1x Aratron- Aratron is mainly just fodder for being tributed, although in some occasions it can be summoned off of Union and Meteonis. It can also be summoned with Phul if you feel like it and have the extra resources. Aratron’s mainly just used for an extra layer of protection.</span><span> </span><span>1x Phul- Phul is mainly not summoned, but if you do summon it, you can use it to get back stuff like Benten to extend your plays. Additionally, while Phul is in hand, it mainly serves to be tributed, but can be used to summon Aratron in some key situations.</span><span> </span><span>3x Fafnir- Fafnir mainly is just used for searching out Nova, as Nova gets a body on field for no cost. Although, Fafnir can also be used to search Meteonis if you need to search Meteonis at the time. Fafnir also gives an extra layer of protection to your Ritual summons, which is, kinda useless in this deck.</span><span> </span><span>3x Nova- Nova is hugely important in this deck, as it easily gets out a Drytron body onto the field with no cost. Nova is also heavily searchable, as Fafnir is an extra 3 copies of it, basically.</span><span> </span><span>1x Meteonis- Meteonis is just ran at one because of how heavily searchable and recyclable it is. Anyway, Meteonis is mainly just used to summon Herald off of Union Carrier, which activates Dawn Knight’s search to send Eva and extend your plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Cyber Emergency- Cyber Emergency is another big searcher for the deck, as it gets you all the Drytrons that you need for no cost, which is amazing in the current game.</span><span> </span><span>3x Preprep- Preprep is mainly used to search out Benten and the Megaliths if you need to get them, and it can recycle Meteonis in very, very specific and rare situations. </span><span> </span><span>The Extra Deck</span>  <span>2x Herald- Arc Light Herald mainly serves to be sent off of Diviner in some situations, if you don’t need to send Trias (as Trias can tribute from hand as well). So Herald can search out your ritual monsters (namely Benten) and Meteonis, whichever you need at the time, whenever it’s sent.</span><span> </span><span>2x Crocosaur- Crocosaur is mainly a beeg synchro that can grow to huge stats, since this deck easily gains its advantage back and gets tons of cards in hand. Crocosaur gives a great source of draw power, as he can be an easy draw 2 if you use 2 tokens or whatever. </span><span> </span><span>2x Borrel- Borrel is the deck’s main boss monster, at the end of the day. Since you can tribute Union and Aurarodoan for a ritual, you can dump tons of Link monsters into the grave. This gives Borrel a ton of targets to equip and gain tons of counters (namely 3 with Aura), so you get 3 negates and a big beater. </span><span> </span><span>2x Crystal Wing- Crystal Wing is a pretty strong beater as a going second and first option, as if you’re playing against a monster heavy deck, Crystal negates literally all of their monster negates and grows Crystal into a huge beater. Additionally, Crystal is capable of gaining even  m o r e  attack to finish off games easily.</span><span> </span><span>2x Halqi- Halqi is one of the deck’s key playmakers, as you can use Sprite and a Drytron or whatever to make Halqi, and use Halqi to summon Diviner way easier than what  I entailed earlier (yes, I forgot about Halqi). Halqi also serves to be sent off for a Ritual summon with Meteonis, as it’s a machine and a Link that can be equipped by a Borrel you’ll eventually make. </span><span> </span><span>2x Auraradon- The monster I can’t spell the name of, Syyeyesnyewyws is mainly used by going into it with 3 Drytrons, as this deck is geared towards being able to shit out 3 Drytrons. (You can allso use 1 Drytron and Halqifibrax, since it’s a Machine. You don’t even have to tribute halqi to get it into the grave.) Aura then shits out 3 tokens, which you use with Diviner to go into Borreload and other huge Synchros. From there, you tribute the remaining tokens for plays, and tribute Aura for a Ritual. Then you equip it from grave to Borrel.</span><span> </span><span>1x Union- Union is mainly summoned by using Trias and a D.D sprite or something like that. Union then equips Dawn Knight from deck. You’ll want to tribute/send off Union, with a ritual or something like that, to activate Dawn Knight’s search. Dawn Knight sends Eva, and Eva searches out another Diviner.</span><span> </span><span>1x N’tss- N’tss is mainly just there to be sent off of Diviner when going second, for a nice, simple pop. It can also be used to counter that one big Dogmatika thing in certain match ups.</span><span> </span><span>1x VFD- Yeah, I hate myself too. VFD is just here as a “Break glass in case of emergency” card, as you can make it sometimes with Crocosaur and also Trias. VFD is rarely summoned and just there for certain, very certain situations.</span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span>  <span>This deck is surprisingly strong for one that runs several fucking garnets. At first, you’ll want to do the  usual Drytron plays; tribute Benten to get out at least 1 Drytron on field, and then burn through all your Benten copies until you search out a Diviner. From there, normal summon Diviner and use Diviner to either A) Send Trias if you didn’t open it, or B) Send Herald if you opened Trias. We’re gonna be going with A here, since it’s the most likely. Now that Trias is in grave, you use it’s effect to tribute Diviner and special summon itself. Diviner’s on tribute effect activates, summoning D.D Sprite directly from deck. Sprite and Trias are then linked off into Halq, and Halq summons Diviner. You then use Halq and at least 1 Drytron to go into Auradon. Auradon shits out tons of tokens, which Diviner synchros with into huge shit like Borreload. You then tribute the Halq and Aura off for a Ritual, and then use Borreload to equip Aura from grave to get 3 counters on it. </span><span> </span><span>This deck is stupid, idiotic, and has no consistency, and I love it. Have a good day.</span><span> </span>"

Remus/Dragon Ravine is a Chaos Ruler turbo without normal summon and it can dig for the Monarchs/Majesty. Ehther can summon,"https://youtu.be/jeWmIC-By3o  Weird, but works! Basic idea is to provide consistency to Monarch, Remus just happen to be one of the best for it. Use Remus add Ravine, use Ravine discard 1 add Legatus, ss Legatus, ss Remus from GY, make Gae Dearg, use Gaedearg add Baby Roc and discard it, ss Baby Roc, make Chaos Ruler and mill for 5, fetch anything you lack (preferably Majesty's Fiend or Dark Simorgh, then handtrap/the Danger! if you want). If starts from Ravine we will negs harder, add Remus, use Remus add 2nd Ravine, use Ravine add Legatus, and continue like normal.  The rest is just consistency card like Danger! (Dogman is the best cus 2400/1000 stats, Nessie can fetch Dogman, Jackalope thins our deck), we dont run Tsuchinoko tho as if its discarded it wont thin our deck (we need to thin the deck for better Chaos Ruler mill/Pantheism draw). Domain will be active if we used those Gae Dearg and Chaos Ruler. We dont run Monarch Erupt as it negates Dark Simorgh and it's not good against Virtual World, Drytron, or Eldlich. Kuraz is there for more draw as we can pop our Ravine. Return of the Monarchs makes any of our tribute summon a lock (adds Ehther, summon during opponent's turn, ss Dark Simorgh/Kuraz, u can also run Seleglare for bounce).  Dark Simorgh is super clutch here, as it can ss itself from hand/GY (if we have DARK and WIND), Ehther can summon it too during our opponent's turn to lock them from setting trap which is super popular right now. Chaos Ruler benefits from DARK and LIGHT attribute to ss itself from GY, making us wont lack big beater for damage.  Pros: Better consistency, more locks (extra deck, monster activation, and cant set cards).  Cons: Monarch sucks, plenty of flaws.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

Use Skill Prisoner to protect your Toon Kingdom of any monsters target effect during 2 turns this may help you in OTK and you will have Toon Bookmarks on graveyard to help you to protect Toon Kingdom too and Toon Terror to negate any effect that doesn't target Toon Kingdom.  &nbsp;  You use your Extra Deck just to use the effect of Pot of Extravagance but if you want you can tribute 2 Toon Luster Soldier to XYZ summon Number 38 or 2 level 7 monsters to XYX summons Number 11 Big Eye but the biggest purpose of extra deck is for Pot Extravagance.

I also added in Dragonmaid Sheou, and House Dragonmaid for The Dragonmaid oriented games where you need more heavy hitters and you can then throw Dragonmaid Ernus or Nudyarl on the field for immunity to card effects!

This build focuses on the interaction between Geargiaccelerator, Geargiauger, and Gear Gigant X to make combos happen.  Due to Geargiaccelerator being able to loop itself via Gear Gigant X's effect if you control another Geargia monster, making three copies of Gear Gigant X is a cakewalk.  In the past, this was the point in which combos stopped, but with Megaclops, you can make that the end of combos.  Like Zoodiac, pot of avarice makes this combo repeatable.  Against combo decks, traps can slow them down to a managable pace, and a larger hand trap lineup assists if going second.  Against a back-row reliant deck, Zeus can be made.  Remember, AA-Zeus is a Machine, so it can be made under cards like Rivalry and Geargiauger.  Depending on your local meta, if you're facing more backrow faced decks, I'd recommend running spell and trap removal in the main deck, such as Heavy Storm Duster, which can be set with Trap Trick.  This deck struggles against interruption like Droll and Lock Bird, El Shaddoll Winda, Nibiru, and Summon Limit.  In terms of other engines that can be splashed, ABC, Red-Eyes, Danger, Eldlich, Numeron, and even Artifact can work.  If AA-Zeus is too expensive, I'd recommend running generic rank 4's in its place such as Abyss Dweller, Tornado Dragon, and Bagooska.  I hope that the Geargia meta can be pushed using cards like Ancient Gear Ballista and Genex Ally Birdman in the future, although I'm not sure of an end-board utilizing it."

If you hard draw into Deskbot 003 you go full combo, which goes as follows NS 003, SS 001, get Halq, SS other 001, get mecha phantom beast auroradran, get 3 tokens, SS 2 001, synchro 2 herald, get dugaress, detach 2 herald for two herald search + 2 cards 1 discard giving you 3 more cards (get chalislime and inception if you don't have it on hand for normal combo), use auroradran to get colt consuming 1 token and dugaress, SS 2 token, SS 2 001, Snychro Herald and Cthuaga, XYZ into Evilswarm for +1 discard and big beater, Emeral for ritual shuffle or tornado for backrow bop (which you don't need as long as you have access to bethor) + draw one card from cthuaga and get another ritual (saffira or vrash). Now it gets a bit murky depending on the game state, usually you go for chalislime to get talismanrune to get another chalislime (phaleg for OTK if you have no other way to get to her) then use inception for Vrash (chalislime and talismanrune) for board wipe if you got second (tho its unlikely you will get this through undisrutped if you go second) then go into phaleg with phul (if you have ophiel + level 8, hagith + level or just unformed in hand you can go into phul-&gt;phaleg no problem) for OTK or you go saffira (use talismanrune as fooder), get inception back to hand and go into bethor (if turn 2 to get board wipe) then go into phaleg with phul or just go into phul + extended megaltih. If you go the second route (for first turn combo) you now have mech beast auroradran + saffira + evilswarm/daigusto + phul and level 4 megalith with a hand of atleast 3. This allows you to rip 1 more card from the opponents hand during the end phase meaning if you have evilswarm it leaves them with 3 cards and it allows you to go into I:P Masquerena then go into either cerberus (with your level 4 megalith + I:P) or into unicorn during their turn making for one more draw/discard + removal or 1 pop with Cerberus. You can also get Apollousa, the bow godess into the deck and use your aurorodran + 1 megalith for a 1600 attack appolousa with 2 negates which is not that great but would leave you with Vrash/Saffira + Appolousa + Evilswarm + Whatever Megalith you still sneak on the field (optimally Phul LV8)  Not hard drawing into Deskbot 003 is not a problem either since most of the decks tools should allow you to go into phul (for bethor bop) + cerberus/unicorn (I:P masquerena knightmare during their turn) with ease and just end on that, impcantation engine can bring you to vrash pretty easily or phaleg for OTK after boardwipes with vrash or bethor.  Vrash/Saffira are entirely replacable by the way as they simply seem like the highest utility to me but feel free to use different Ritual monsters to end the games, as long as they are easily inside the range of talismandra+chalislime or even better just one of those they are worth considering. Magician of black chaos max is pretty good as you can get it with Och in the opponents turn for more disruption plays (sacrifice it or another thing on the field to disrupt opponents monster effects for a turn). I put two options in the side deck now.  Borrelsword exists for alternative OTK option, if you want easy combos to go into borrelsword replace tornado dragon or smth else with Ausha as she easily allows Link climbs. You can play accescode too but who can afford that.  Ash is mildly optional, i like it if i go second so I don't get a board of denies against me.  If you just can't get to inception for some reason to get into vrash or saffire, just go into och through ophiel search/replace. Also allows you to draw 1/discard 1.

That was what I was thinking when I first read it.  The Deck has your average <strong>Buster Blader</strong> monsters. 3 <strong>Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordsman</strong> and 3 <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong>. We do need lights for <strong>Albion</strong> so we are running 1 <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia</strong> and 1 <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong>. 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. And since we are playing <strong>Stigmatika</strong>, we need 3 copies of <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.  Spells and Traps are the biggest part of the deck. 3 <strong>Pot of Disparity</strong> to get to your<strong> Buster Blader</strong> or <strong>Stigmata</strong> plays. 3 <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong> since it is a generic fusion spell that can also act as a <strong>Miracle Fusion</strong> for the <strong>Albaz</strong> fusions and it sets itself if it is discarded off of <strong>Albaz</strong>. 3 <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> for some <strong>Dogmatika</strong> plays. 3 <strong>Destruction Swordsman Fusion</strong>. 2 <b>Dogmatika Encounter </b>which recurs your <strong>Dogmatikas </strong>and <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>. 2 <strong>Stigmatika Scream</strong> which gets back any fusion which includes ur <strong>Buster Blader</strong> fusion. 3 <strong>Trap Trick</strong>. 3 <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> which is prime real-estate for your <strong>Buster Blader</strong> plays. 2<strong> Destruction Sword Memories</strong> which is sent off of <strong>Prologue</strong>. 2 <strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong> for some interruption.  Extra Deck is kind of tight. You need to run your <strong>Buster Blader</strong> cards and cards for <strong>Dogmatika</strong> and <strong>Stigmatika</strong> and you need to ensure it can handle the cost of <strong>Disparity</strong>. 2 <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</strong>. 2 <strong>Albion the Stigmatika Dragon</strong>. 2<strong> Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</strong> (for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> and<strong> Albion</strong>). 1 <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>. 1 <strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</strong>. 2 <strong>Buster Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Wind Pegasus @Ignister</strong> for it's grave eff. 1 of the <strong>BLS</strong> link. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>. 1<strong> Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong>. 1 <strong>Linkuriboh</strong>.  Side Deck has 3 <strong>Lancea</strong>, 3 <strong>Belle</strong>, 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1 <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>, and 2 <strong>Judgment of Stigmatika</strong> which is just a specific board wipe. There are also more fusions that you can use in tandem with <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.<strong> Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong>, <strong>Borreload Furious Dragon</strong>, and <strong>Brigand the Glory Dragon</strong> are all summonable off of <strong>Albaz</strong> and off of <strong>Albion</strong>. I only play <strong>Glory Dragon</strong> since it lists <strong>Albaz</strong> as material which means you can use <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong>'s<strong> Miracle Fusion</strong> eff and since its a more specific summoning requirement against decks whose monsters don't fit the bill for your other targets."

You can skip MP1 using Amorphactor pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord and with Terminal World both players skip MP2. The idea was inspired after duelling someone online using Thunder of Ruler to skip the battle phase. The ruling of yugioh is there can be no mp2 if there is no battle phase if you do wish to run a trap trick/thunder ruler to ensure it can't be quick play removed.  The x3 Preparation of rights lets you search Benten to search Vanities Ruler if you need another lockdown turn 1 or ritual summon multiple times.  Cyber angel Natasha is the perfect atk level to ritual summon after recovering the ritual spell then gain LP/protect rituals. Combo with Unicorn to lock extra deck monsters.. or ritual loop summon with Idaten (re-adding ritual spell with eff then tribute with draitron to gain the atk and resummon with the draitron u summoned) to give +1k atk permanently.  Disciple of the Nadir allows u to pop/search by sending from the extra deck to grab Dogmatika Albaz Knight from the deck OR GY! then u can discard for draitron effect after the search.  On the turn you don't use the Dogma engine you can xyz into Lyrilusc to attack directly then xyz AA-Zeus on MP2 to wipe the field.  This missing extra deck cards were 2 Fossil Machine Skill wagons for backrow removal."

Nothing to special, but a deck I hold dearly.","Its a pretty standard Windwitch Majespecter Deck with the new support for the Windwitch-Archetype from ""<em>Blazing Vortex""</em> (04.02.2021).  Main goal of this deck is to use your Windwitch engine to summon the <em>""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon""</em> or as a alternative (to have some fun) the new Boss of the Windwitches<em> ""Windwitch - Diamond Bell""</em>.  The Majespecters will mainly be used as fodder for your bigger summons or to tribute them for their own Spell and Trap Cards to gain some control over the board.  Tech Cards for this Deck are one copie of <em>""Servant of Endymion""</em> (since she is a Wind/Spellcaster which can be used as a normal scale for pendelum + free summon for a Bunbuku) and two <em>""Luster Pendelum, the Dracoslayer""</em> (for another pseudo boss<em> ""Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer""</em>).  <em>""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara""</em> is in this deck in case that you start with only one copy of<em> ""Windwitch - Snow Bell""</em> and <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em>. <ol>  	<li>In this case you can normal summon your <em>""Windwitch - Snow Bell""</em>, after that activate the effect of <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em> to special summon her from hand.</li>  	<li>Then you can raise the lvl of <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em> from 3 to 4 to summon<em> ""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara""</em> (Lvl 5).</li>  	<li>Since he was summoned using this two special Windwitches, Chanbara cant be destroyed by battle or opponents card effects.</li> </ol> I know its not the best summon possible, but it is still a decent wall for a Fun/Casual Deck.  &nbsp;  I tried to fit in the <em>""Quintet Magician""</em> but I am not sure what to switch out for it."

Very frail deck but the payoff is huge.,"A very very frail deck.  Strategy is to summon <a data-name=""Cloudian - Turbulence"">Cloudian - Turbulence </a>and get at least 7 Fog Counters on it and then proceed to spew out link monsters until you have a good board. Your Frogs are a back-up plan or a combo extender to your Cloudians, being able to make <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> to disrupt your opponents next turn and gain advantage or using <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to add to your link plays.  With 7 Fog Counters you can make <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess + </a><a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon (for the lockdown) </a>or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess </a>+ <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>(for the 9500ish combined attack).  <a data-name=""Fog Control"">Main ways to get Fog Counters on Turbulence:</a>  Turbulence gains counters on Normal Summon equal to the amount of face-up Cloudians. So he always starts with 1. But with the use of <a data-name=""Water Hazard"">Water Hazard</a> to Special Summon a Cloudian from your hand first or just from having Cloudians left over from the previous turn, he can start with more Counters.  3/5/7 Counters) Normal Summon Turbulence + 1/2/3 Fog Control in hand (Activate Turbulence's effect first to summon a <a data-name=""Cloudian - Smoke Ball"">Cloudian - Smoke Ball</a> and then tribute that Smoke Ball and place the 3 counters on the Turbulence and repeat to the number of Fog Controls in your hand)  4 Counters) <a data-name=""Cloudian Aerosol"">Cloudian Aerosol</a> in hand +  Level 4 Cloudian Monster in  hand (Activate Aerosol and tribute a Cloudian in your hand and place the 4 Counters on Turbulence)  1 Counter) <a data-name=""Cloudian - Storm Dragon"">Cloudian - Storm Dragon</a> + 1 Cloudian in the GY (Banish 1 Cloudian (usually a level 4) from your GY to Special Summon Storm Dragon from hand. Once per turn, he allows you to place 1 Counter on Turbulence)  Just mess around with it and you'll soon get all the other combos for links and Counters and whatnot."

Cons: Still an Orcust deck, dies to negated normal summon."

The deck is still just as good as ever, still as fun as ever too. This list is made from the TCG banlist and format, but contains cards for Lightning Overdrive, a set that has not yet even been out in the OCG yet if I'm not mistaken, so the deck is susceptible to change depending on what our next banlist looks like and how the meta shapes up. <h2>Ratio Explanation</h2> <h3>Main Deck:</h3> <h4>The Plunders:</h4> 3x whitebeard, its the best starter in the deck, it floats into another plunder.  3x redbeard, a great card to go into ships with, is vital to the halq combo  3x bluebeard, it's a decent extender and a name so your not locked out of it by your other plunders  3x goldenhair, it's both a starter and extender for the deck, it makes the toad line live among other various utilities.  3x ravenwing (new card), it's an extender that recycles a plunder, the only downside is it's the only extender that locks you into plunders by it's effect <h4>Other Starters/Extenders:</h4> 3x shthana, it's a free water, arguably better than silent angler as an extender <h4>Handtraps:</h4> 3x ash blossom, it's one of if not the most versatile handtrap right now  3x ghost belle, this is very effective against the current TCG meta, is subject to change based on how the format continues  1x effect veiler, is only here as a technicality, really you use it more for the halq combo as a level one tuner, but it could potentially come up at some point as a hantrap <h4>Spells/Traps:</h4> 3x emblem, it tags out a plunder into a ship, it's more useful on the draw than on the play  3x shipyarrrd, the field spell that searches your deck, do I really have to say more  1x shipshape ships shipping, you use this as discard fodder as well as being a good extender, I have hard made Lys with this about as many times as I've seen an aesthetically pleasing ojama card  2x salvage, this recycles plunders from grave for more fodder for your ships  1x terraforming, it's an extra copy of the field spell, it's at one, so you can only play one  3x dark ruler no more, it's a good call card against the current meta, it shuts down vanitys ruler in drytron, and can shut VW out of VFD if they don't shotgun it.  3x booty, this is not only a great extender, but also your crutch against unfavorable attribute matchups <h3>The Extra Deck:</h3> <h4>The Ships:</h4> 2x lys, it's the best ship, light is a common attribute and it negates monster effects  2x moerk, dark is another common attribute, and it banishes cards  2x brann, the worst ship, fire isn't common in most decks outside of ash since infernobles died, banishing backrow is alright against some decks <h4>The Best Card:</h4> 3x Blackbeard, it can tag out into ships while drawing a card, it's easy to go into,this card is instrumental to many of your plays <h4>The Halq Combo Cards:</h4> 1x halq, it's halq, it grabs a tuner from deck, need I say more  1x quandax, you tag into this with halq's second effect, and use it for synchro plays on your opponent's turn  1x quariongandrax, this is what you make with quanax, it can banish two cards <h4>The Toad Combo Cards:</h4> 1x bahamut shark, this shit out a toad  1x toad, it's the boy, an omni negate <h3>The Others:</h3> 1x almiraj, you use this if you open nothing else in your hand but one goldenhair, then you can make blackbeard with this card at least. <h2>Combos</h2> <h3>The Halq Combo (Whitebeard + Extender):</h3> <ol>  	<li>Summon Whitebeard and extender</li>  	<li>Make Halq</li>  	<li>Cl1 whitebeard to summon redbeard</li>  	<li>Cl2 halq to get veiler</li>  	<li>Opponent's turn tag out halq for quandax</li>  	<li>Cl1 redbeard tag out into a ship</li>  	<li>Cl2 quandax to synchro summon quariongandrax</li>  	<li>quariongandrax to banish up to three cards</li>  	<li>redbeard effect to equip to a ship</li> </ol> <h3>The Toad Combo (Goldenhair + Extender):</h3> <ol>  	<li>summon goldenhair and extender</li>  	<li>overlay into bahamut shark</li>  	<li>bahamut shark to bring out toad detaching goldenhair</li>  	<li>goldenhair effect in grave to revive itself</li>  	<li>link goldenhair and bahamut shark into blackbeard</li>  	<li>opponent's turn tag blackbeard out for a ship</li> </ol> <h2>Potential Techs:</h2> <h3>Gozer:</h3> It is good disruption for fiend decks, as well as being easy to summon <h3>Dragite:</h3> Another good disruption card for the deck <h3>Go Second Toolbox:</h3> This deck can OTK very easily, but in this format, attempting to blind second with a deck that isn't dinos is a death wish. <h2>Closing Thoughts:</h2> This is a very versatile and fun deck, I love how it plays so much on your opponent's turn, it's never really a dull game with this deck, except when you are starring down a VFD or Vanities Ruler and can't play the game."

They were a pretty fine deck, could get out a Towers and a Darkfluid with some monster negates, but that's really it. <em>However</em>, with the newest support including <strong>Dark Infant @Ignister</strong>, <strong>Danmari @Ignister</strong>, as well as <strong>When A.I. First Met You</strong>, this deck has become truly an explosive force to be reckoned with. Using only a single card, this deck can set up a 4K Arrival with a Danmari in the GY to serve as a negate, and that's not even counting the other cards in hand! When going first, the goal is to end on this Arrival with Danmari in grave, as well as a Cyberse Magician and Cyberse Quantum Dragon on field to serve as a pseudo targeting effect/battle phase lock. Going second, this deck has many options, but my favorite is a fun little Fire Phoenix @Ignister OTK thanks to Misplaymaker on the Ignister Deck Discord.  &nbsp;  So first, let's start with the one card OTK combo because it's the easiest to go through. This can be done with either Pikari or Achichi in the opening hand, I'll use Pikari as an example. <ol>  	<li>Normal Pikari, add When A.I. First Met You</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant, add A.I. Land to hand</li>  	<li>Activate A.I. Land</li>  	<li>Activate When A.I. First Met You, searching Achichi by revealing Fire Phoenix</li>  	<li>Special summon Achichi, add Bururu</li>  	<li>Link summon Splash Mage</li>  	<li>Special summon Bururu, send Donyoribo from deck to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Splash Mage's effect to special summon Pikari from grave</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Wind Pegasus using Pikari and Bururu</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari back with Bururu's effect</li>  	<li>Activate Pikari's effect to make Wind Pegasus level 4</li>  	<li>Overlay Pikari and Wind Pegasus for Mathmech Alembertian</li>  	<li>Detach 2 materials to add Mathmech Multiplication from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Tribute Alembertian using its effect to special summon Multiplication</li>  	<li>Link summon Fire Phoenix using Splash Mage and Multiplication</li>  	<li>Double Fire Phoenix's attack using Multiplication's effect</li>  	<li>Attack using Fire Phoenix, activating its effect to deal effect damage equal to its attack</li>  	<li>Chain Donyoribo's effect in GY to double the effect damage from Fire Phoenix, dealing 9200 directly for game</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Now, that combo is for going second. For going first, the start is essentially the same. The hands can get a bit tricky to navigate to reach an Arrival end-board, so I won't give an example of that loooooong combo line for Quantum Dragon and Cyberse Magician, but I will do a basic 1-card line for Arrival with Danmari. <ol>  	<li>Normal Achichi, add Pikari</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant, add A.I. Land to hand</li>  	<li>Activate A.I. Land</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari, add When A.I. First Met You</li>  	<li>Link summon Cyberse Wicckid</li>  	<li>Activate When A.I. First Met You, searching Doyon by revealing Dark Templar</li>  	<li>Special summon Doyon, add Achichi from GY to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Cyberse Wicckid's effect, banishing Dark Infant to add Bururu from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Link summon Splash Mage using Doyon and Wicckid</li>  	<li>Activate Doyon's effect to add When A.I. First Met You back to hand from the GY</li>  	<li>Special summon Bururu, send Danmari from deck to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Splash Mage's effect to special summon Doyon from grave</li>  	<li>Use all 3 monsters to link summon Dark Templar</li>  	<li>Special summon Achichi to a zone Dark Templar points to</li>  	<li>Activate Dark Templar's effect, special summoning back Bururu and Pikari</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Wind Pegasus using Pikari and Bururu</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari back with Bururu's effect</li>  	<li>Use all 4 monsters to link summon The Arrival. This leaves you on a 4K towers, Danmari in grave, and Wind Pegasus in grave for further interruption</li> </ol> Of course this is done with 1 card, from here you can use your remaining cards to continue setting up or hold them for later. Ideally, you will also have a Cyberse Quantum Dragon and Cyberse Magician on field as well, but it tends to take a total of 2-3 cards in total for the full combo and not just 1. Additionally, Formud Skipper is a fun starter for quickly getting to your ritual monsters if you already start with Achichi or Pikari in hand. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Formud Skipper</li>  	<li>Activate Skipper's effect and reveal The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister to change its name</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant using Skipper, searching A.I. Land and chaining Skipper to search either Water Leviathan or Cyberse Magician</li>  	<li>Do the rest of the combo normally but go into Cyberse Witch partway through, special summoning a monster to its zone to banish a spell and add the other rital monster + Cynet Ritual</li> </ol> &nbsp;  But yeah, those are some of the new fun thing @Ignisters can do! Obviously this deck is made with going both first and second in mind, but in games 2 and 3 you can side out cards from either half of the deck based on if you are going first or second. Hope this is helpful to all of you aspiring Ignister players!

I wouldn't call it anything too special or crazy. optimally I ","Ok, so this deck is something I have been working on since 2016- I don't know how good it is nor do I care to get too competitive cause I don't like how I get when I get competitive. But I figured I would upload an optimal list based on the December 15th ban-list. I know Dragoon is not well liked the way it is used- but to be fair it isn't even the focus on my deck it's just a neat add- on to me as I haven't even used it or experienced it used against me yet. This is the first time I am uploading a deck profile here, please don't be too harsh- I understand if you would criticize the deck build for not being meta relevant enough; I'm just lookin to improve my deck building strategies. The goal of this deck as I stated in the summary is essentially ending on a board with primarily Dragon knight, and whatever I can use to sway the battle in my favor. Nothing too degenerate, unless you adamantly hate dragoon- which I subbed paladin out for. I generally put myself up to a challenge of using fusion, synchro, xyz, pendulum, link, and ritual in a deck to get better at those SS. I doubt that it would even handle a YCS, but this deck is special to me- it has seen me through many a tough stressful duel with friends and relatives whom played the game. I must also add it has seen countless revisions and variations. I meant to include rod and maybe robe but again the focus isn't too heavily on just Dark Magician but protecting the field with dragons, warriors and spellcasters . Initially I wanted to use citadel of endymion for spell-counter control but when I saw how easily my board was picked apart by a duelist whom I was a rival of well into the first couple of iterations I decided to eventually cut it for iris. a lot of the inspiration for this deck came from duels with friends and the combinations of the cards they used. I built this deck through trial and error as well as the sequence of cards I obtained- initially it was all spellcasters and roughly thrown together in it's prototype configuration. after many losses in 2016 I spent countless hours studying the rulebook, tips, and card strategy which ultimately would take four years of time. I have yet to even Extra Link yet, or even figure out how to incorporate Links into my strategy properly. I've made 60 card, 50 card, and 40 card variants but I excelled with 50-60 card variants. I would like to eventually get it to a 40 card variant which would more efficiently and consistently hone my strategy. I absolutely dislike Pot of Desires, Extravagance would be more tolerable. That said thank you for reading patiently. I appreciate your feedback"

This can either be on your side of the field or on you opponents. All magical musketeers have the same effect: All magical muskets (spell and trap cards) can be activated from the hand during either players turn.</p> <p>A quick overview of magical musketeers &amp; effects used in the deck:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Starfire: (monster searcher/special summon) You can special summon 1 magical musketeer in DEF position.</li>  	<li>Casper: (searcher) You can add 1 magical musket card from deck to your hand (except the one that triggered the effect)</li>  	<li>Kidbrave: (draw power) You can discard 1 magical musket card and draw 2 cards.</li>  	<li>Doc: (Recycle 1) You can add 1 magical musket card form you GY to your hand (except the on that triggered the effect)</li>  	<li>Wild: (Recycle 2+ draw) You can target 3 musket cards in you GY, shuffle them in the deck then draw 1 card.</li>  	<li>Calamity: (monster reborn) You can special summon 1 magical musketeer and special summon it in DEF position.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The magical muskets (spell and trap cards) can only be activated when a magical musketeer is on the field. Note that as mentioned earlier, when a magical musketeer is on the field these can be activated from hand. All magical muskets can only be activated once per turn</p> <p>A quick overview of Magical muskets used in the deck:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Cross-domination: Target 1 face up monster; negate its effect &amp; change ATK &amp; DEF to 0 until the rest of the turn.</li>  	<li>Last stand: When your opponent activates a spell/Trap card, negate the activation and destroy that card.</li>  	<li>Dancing needle: Target up to 3 cards in GY's banish them.</li>  	<li>Desperado: Target 1 face up card on the field, destroy it.</li>  	<li>Crooked crown: During the MP special summon 1 magical musketeer from hand and if the main monster zone of the column of the special summon monster is unused, your opponent can't used that for the rest of the turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>About the Eldlich archetype:</strong> <p>The eldich archetype has some similarities with the magical musket; Your trap cards only gain their <span>""</span>Golden<span>"" </span>effect when the golden lord is on the field.</p> <p>An overview of the eldlich cards used:</p> <p>Golden monsters &amp; trap monsters</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Eldlich the golden lord: Send this card &amp; 1 Spell/Trap from your hand to the GY, then target 1 card to pop. If this card is in the GY you can send 1 spell/trap card you control to the GY to add the golden lord back to your hand. Then you can specail summon a zombie monster<span><strong>*</strong></span> form you hand, it gains 1000 ATK/DEF and can't be destroyed by card effects until the and of the turn. You can only use each effect once per turn.</li>  	<li>Conquistador: When you activate is you can special summon this as a normal monster. ""Golden"" effect: Destroy 1 face-up card on the field. When this card is in your GY you can banish it to set 1 eldlixer from you deck. you can only use 1 effect per turn and only once per turn.</li>  	<li>Huaquero: When you activate is you can special summon this as a normal monster. ""Golden"" effect: Banish 1 card from either GY. When this card is in your GY you can banish it to set 1 eldlixer from you deck. you can only use 1 effect per turn and only once per turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The eldlixers:</p> <p>a good note to add here is that after an special summon is conducted with an eldlixer you are locked into special summoning zombies,  therefore you can not go into and extra deck non-zombie or trigger some of you magical musketeers effects.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Black: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you hand or deck <span><strong>*</strong></span> in DEF position. You can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY. Only 1 effect of Black can be used per turn and once per turn.</li>  	<li>White: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you hand or GY <span><strong>*</strong></span>. During MP1 you can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY. Only 1 effect of White can be used per turn and once per turn.</li>  	<li>Sanguine: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you deck or GY<span><strong>*</strong></span>. You can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY.

You can only activate 1 ""golden land forever"" once per turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><span><span>*</span></span> note that the golden lord is the only zombie/Eldlich monster you play.</p> <strong>Other cards</strong>: <p>As suggested in the earlier comments on the deck profile some draw power goes a long way. I've added two cards to increase the decks draw power:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Pot of extravagance: At the start op MP1 banish 3 or 6 cards random facedown from you extra deck. Draw 1 card for every 3 cards banished. for the rest of this turn after this card resolves you cannot draw any card by card effects.</li>  	<li>Upstart goblin: Draw 1 card, then your opponent gains 1000 LP</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Other cards:</strong> <p>In the side deck I've put cards that either are in the archetype and not used, or could make a great addition. (If you have any more suggestions, let me know!)</p> <p>Not used:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Cursed Eldand: Although, it is used in almost any eldlich deck, however here it has a big downside: You can't attack with zombie monsters which hurts your Liebe, Borrelsword and musketeers.</li>  	<li>Guardian: It is simply the weakest golden land card and there is no space. The only positive not here is that it doesn't target.</li>  	<li>Zakiel: Same as guardian, the weakest magical musketeer. And there is no space in the deck.</li>  	<li>Steady hands: one of the lack luster musket cards.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> Could come in handy, but... no room:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Fiendish deal: Allows your musketeers to be protected from destruction with card effects.</li>  	<li>White elephant gift: Could bring extra draw power. When the goldenland trapmonsters are summoned they are normal monsters and could be scarified for a 2 card draw.</li>  	<li>Adelantado: Would be an ultimate board clear when thing go south.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>The extra deck:</strong> <p>Neither Magical musket or Eldlich uses the extra deck with an exception of 3 cards. I will not go in depth on the effects except of the cards that are great for this deck (in my opinion)</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Magical musketeer Max: If this card is Link Summoned: You can activate 1 of these effects; <ul>  	<li>Add ""Magical Musket"" Spells/Traps with different names from your Deck to your hand, up to the number of monsters your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Special Summon ""Magical Musket"" monsters with different names from your Deck, up to the number of Spells/Traps your opponent controls. You can only use this effect of ""Magical Musketeer Max"" once per turn. During either player's turn, you can activate ""Magical Musket"" Spell/Trap Cards from your hand.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Gustav Max: once per turn: You can detach 1 material form this card: inflict 2000 DMG to your opponent.</li>  	<li>Juggernaut Liebe: Once per turn, you can also Xyz Summon Juggernaut Liebe by using 1 Rank 10 Machine Xyz Monster you control as material. (Transfer its materials to this card.) Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card; it gains 2000 ATK/DEF, also for the rest of this turn, you can only declare an attack with this card. During each Battle Phase, this card can make attacks on monsters up to the number of Xyz Materials it has +1.</li>  	<li>Knightmare package</li>  	<li>Borrelsword dragon</li>  	<li>Constellar Pleiades</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <b>The quantity's of each card:</b>  The 2 archetypes have both a similarity they absolutely NEED their monsters in order to result their disruptions. Therefor the deck maxes out on the best musketeers &amp; the golden lord. The other musketeers are at1 since they are better used in the grind game.  I've put all magical musket disruption at 2. In some match-ups you can change this depending on  the deck you're facing.  For the eldlixer I've put all of them at 2 these are needed to special summon the golden lord. Sanguine is at 3 because it is both GY &amp; Deck and it can be activated on you opponents turn, bypassing the zombie locking in your turn.  Conquistador is at 3 because it is better than Huaquero in my opinion (and Huaquero is outclassed with dancing needle). And Golden land forever is at 2 for a nice omni-negate.  For draw power: Pot is great, but can not trigger a musketeer the first turn. Upstart goblin can, which could result you in multiple draw/searches with the right musketeer.  In the extra deck I've put all the card I find crucial at 3. Because the probability of the banishing a crucial card is significantly decreased at 3:  website: https://www.dcode.fr/picking-probabilities:  when banishing 6 cards: <table>  <tr> <td>Nr. of cards</td> <td>chance of banishing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>47,5 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>29,6 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>4,4 %</td> </tr>  </table> When banishing 3 cards: <table>  <tr> <td>Nr. of cards</td> <td>chance of banishing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>43.5 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>7.9 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>0.2 %</td> </tr>  </table> <strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong> <ul>  	<li>You need your Musketeers and/or golden lord in order to make your disruptions go off.</li>  	<li>all eldlixers  lock you into only being able to special summon zombies.</li>  	<li>Make sure you place your cards in the correct columns</li> </ul> I hope you liked this deck profile and if you have any remarks/tips let me know!"

This is great by itself but the rose dragons make dragon link even better than it already is! Now the end board (1.5 cards) is VFD, Apollusa (2 negates), an extra savage and (if you have ANY additional extender) a Dragoon as well! This is really big since it is 2 extra OMNI negates. This is fairly easy to pull off and the deck is full of extenders. For the new rose dragon cards I am using Rocss Rose dragon (is a starter, combo piece and TUNER) and Petal rose shoot (monster reborn for rose dragons and can be searched off of rocss rose). I am not running the new garden rose flower or the garden rose maiden because with the death of linkross, it is not possible to play those in dragon link, sorry! Also I decided to make this a 60 card deck to avoid drawing bricks and so that I could run dragoon. The deck is still consistent, it now has 12 starters (3 of each rocss rose, sefert, chaos space and black metal) so you should see 1 every 5 cards which is perfect if you ask me. Same goes for the extenders, you should see them also very often. For bricks you have - dragondark (Omg you never want to draw this), Driver, Red-eyes Black Dragon, Red-eyes Fusion and Dark Magician. The soft bricks include Boot sector launch and Dragonhawk since you are going to search them anyway and drawing into them simply means you need to use it from the hand. Red rose is not a brick, I made a separate combo for it in my video (you don’t summon it from the hand off of halq) and it proves red-rose isn’t a brick. Dragonroar is not a brick in most cases since you can use sefert/white dragon/black dragon/chaos space to combo with it and you can banish tempest instead with Trish (tempest search draco). Tempest can be milled off of ravine if you draw absorouter or tracer. Also some cards in this build you may think are bricks are actually not, like White rose (can special itself if you have tracer, red rose or rocss rose and can be special summoned off of red rose if you already have the rocss rose on the field), Tempest (can simply discard it and it can come back from the grave), Crusadia Draco (can special itself from hand), Petal rose shoot (can summon a rose dragon from the grave - halq always summons a rose dragon so it will not brick since a rose will always be in the grave). </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Other notes</b><span>: I am also running the versatile handtraps for countering the current format (Jan 2021), if you are viewing this sometime later where it is a different format you can change up the handtrap lineup. I also use 2 petal rose shoots, not one since Rocss rose is not only a starter but also a very key combo piece! You need the 2 petal rose shoots to secure that you have at least 1 of it in deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, all the </span><b>combos</b><span>, explanations and everything are in my youtube video, Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and also notifies you every time I upload!

You have cards that you can drop to go more aggressive like nib for galactic and melody for shrine or going second cards like ruler no more and free galaxy lod tribute.  You play this deck simply by special summoning a bunch of photons until your opponent runs out of negates or you make at minimum one rank 8 to break boards easily(i.e steal a monster than pop a card then use the stolen monster to make more shenanegans), you have 6 hand traps so youll likely hit at least a nib or imperm to slow them down, and as long as you dont draw utter dog you can play through one or more hand traps usually** nib is still rough but no one really knows when to nib you so youre normally able to cheat out more specials or finally use your normal plus the nib token to pop off.  &nbsp;  Things that are alil different here,  The melodys, 3 trade-in, and 3 trance. I run the 3 trance because of the two previous cards. The third trade in because of the 2 melody and the 2 melody because you dont actually want to run 3 afterglow since its only really a special summon once per turn and you really want to have a solid way to get your GEP dragon to hand or even galactic if you need to.  &nbsp;  I considered galactic main and am not opposed to it, it seems nutty especially when you can get your afterglow and photon dragon plus some extra minions then shrine and get a 5 man board of level 8s for 3 rank 8s (using afterglow second effect) and four if you count draglubion (i dont i just use it for otk)"

Eternal Soul and Circle are the bread and butter of the deck.  this deck is mainly based on being a pure build with as little help from other stratergies as possible. (I find them more fun that way) I use Ash Blossom personally because of how generic it is as a negate and hits most decks. Yes as the norm for DM Decks at the moment, Verte Anaconda, Red-Eyes fusion and Dragoon are here, however it is not the main stratergy of my deck. I use the Spellbook draw engine over cards like Allure Of Darkness because of the downside of Allure aswell as the Spellbook Engine deck thins allowing me to get to the key combo pieces quickly.  Dark Magician Girl is a marmite subject among DM players, However in my opinion the upsides of being able to utilize The Dark Magicians floating effect and a extra draw off of Soul Servant is too good to ignore in my personal opinion. Bond and Dark Burning magic have been a tech in my tech since their release, apart from Burning Magic being my favorite card, it has won me games more times then i can count purely because nobody expects it. However, ido understand why people choose not to run it.  As for tech cards and side deck its up to you what cards you want to run. Dark Magic Veil is a good card for this deck, allowing you to summon from your hand or from the GY to summon up those powerful Dark Spellcasters. I like Secret Village as it always works well with a spellcaster deck. The solemns cards are brilliant. I find myself going between Solemn Strike and Solemn Judgement but at the moment i find myself wanting solemn strikes. The virus cards are also very well suited to a DM deck. One of My personal favorite techs is Dark Renewel, basically acting as a Solemn Strike and riding the feild of your opponents monster but giving you a summon from the GY or Deck at the same time."

Deck still operates the same with some alter to the combo because no O-Lion in TCG. We need to maximize the search for Stromberg, even have to use Set Rotation with Mid-Breaker Field (Auroradon, Dragoon, Immortal Phoenix Gearfried, and our combo endboard don't use targeting anyway). The Borreload Savage + Herald Arc Light are just my preferred endboard, but some VW/Drytron can push it. It's better to end on VFD instead (all Halq combo is able to end on VFD).  Pros: Super consistent, powerful endboard, stronger in TCG because can use Dragoon.  Cons: Fragile to handtrap, especially without Crossout Designator."

The deck is meant to be fairly adaptable; they're two copies of the three God Cards and the one you'll want to focus on during the duel depends heavily on the state of the game; if you're opponent has a powerful ""boss monster"" that you want to get rid of, then you'll want to focus on summoning Obelisk to beat over it, or Ra to destroy it with its effect. If you want to slow your opponent down, then you'll want to focus on summoning Slifer. Out of all the Egyptian Gods, Obelisk is the one you want to special summon the most since he has baseline ATK and DEF and inherent protection; The True Name (combined with Card Advance) allows you to special summon right from the deck, and Monster Reborn is meant to revive Obelisk for a powerful attack before he returns to the Graveyard. The Absolute Divine Beast can be used to revive Obelisk so that he shield you or your monsters from an attack from one of your opponent's strong monsters. However the primary purpose of The Absolute Divine Beast is allowing the God Cards to dominate the field."

The Normalcy strategy allows to play a ton of haymaker cards like Justi Break while opening up access to first of the Dragons which the Story duelists will struggle to overcome. Blue Dragon Summoner massively improves the consistency of setting your scales and summoning more monsters. This will hopefully help in getting started without needing to spend DP early to build a deck.

The deck is meant to be fairly adaptable; they're two copies of the three God Cards and the one you'll want to focus on during the duel depends heavily on the state of the game; if you're opponent has a powerful ""boss monster"" that you want to get rid of, then you'll want to focus on summoning Obelisk to beat over it, or Ra to destroy it with its effect. If you want to slow down your opponent, then you'll want to focus on summoning Slifer the Sky Dragon. Out of all the Egyptian Gods, Obelisk is the one you want to special summon the most since he has baseline ATK and DEF and inherent protection; The True Name (combined with Card Advance) allows you to special summon Obelisk right from the deck, and Monster Reborn is meant to revive Obelisk for a powerful attack before he returns to the Graveyard. The Absolute Divine Beast can be used to revive Obelisk so that he shield you or your monsters from an attack from one of your opponent's strong monsters. However the primary purpose of The Absolute Divine Beast is allowing the God Cards to dominate the field. The primary purpose of Monster Reborn (besides the fact that I think the Ankh is freaking cool) is to revive Obelisk, or previously used tribute fodder for the summon of another Egyptian God. This deck's main weakness is bricking, and with a lack of conventional stall cards this deck can't hold out for long if it can't get its momentum going. Having said that, the amount of search power this deck has, combined with how easily its monsters can be summoned, makes this God Card deck quite consistent and a lot of fun to play."

Combo is just Halq + 1 extender, watch the video. If no extender (only Halq), we couldnt extend to the Drytron if we're aiming for VFD. Summon Quandax instead of Arc Light, use Auroradon tribute 2 tokens, ss Coltwing+2tokens+001, make Shooting Riser dump lv1 to GY making Shooting Riser lv6, make Shenshen using Shooting Riser+token, make Trishula fusion using Auroradon+token+Coltwing, make VFD.  Pros: Just regular Eldlich Synchro, but ultra powerful because Natasha+Shenshen follow-up.  Cons: Eldlich Synchro is not too good right now because fragile to handtrap and more bricks."

May the biggest, most badass dragon win! ","This is a pure Odd-Eyes Dragons archetype deck with some stables that you can swap for whatever you like. The main strategy is to special summon a bunch of high ATK dragons to quickly kill your opponents. It can adapt to some varieties of situations but absolutely suffer from anything that specifically designed to kill/limit spell cards. <p class=""p1""><strong>Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon</strong> is the key card to bring out almost any monsters in the deck. You can trigger it by eff of <strong>Sky Iris</strong>, <strong>Spiral Flame Strike</strong>, T<strong>win Twisters</strong>, and <strong>Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon</strong> or slamming your Odd-Eyes into an opponent monster. This deck provides 13-17 cards to get it. However, it has no protection and has to rely on Omni-negate and/or ordering chain-link for that. You can use <strong>Odd-Eyes Wizard Dragon</strong> and/or <strong>Persona</strong>/<strong>Mirage</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> to add another chain-link to protect it from negate-destruction on triggered.</p> It's easy to properly bring out <strong>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong> (and then recycled it) on 70% of the opening hands, provided that you're not negated in the important chain, by Special Summoning <strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver</strong>. You can also cheat it out with the eff of <strong>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong>, note that it's very easy to miss timing Vortex's eff <strong>when</strong> it's special summoned.  Stack <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon - Overlord</strong> on <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon</strong> to get 3 attacks. If you have an opening scale when it's destroyed, you can place it in the pendulum zone and if you're on MP1, you can then Special Summon <strong>Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon</strong> to finish your opponent HP.  <strong>Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon</strong> is mostly there to be material for <strong>Odd-Eyes</strong> <strong>Fusion</strong>, or to beat something with its 3000 ATK and then bring out <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong> if you ran out of other XYZ monsters or they all get banished with <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong>.

Why do I like this deck?  Well you see the reason why I chosen phantasm spiral is because of pacifis and the torrential tribute searcher as that just allows you to keep on generating more and more advantage.  This deck is so consistent and you are probably never going to get otk'd becuase of cards such as heat wave.  Phantasm Spiral Battle is also a spell or trap removal type card.  The deck doesn't care about vfd since all the monsters I play in this deck are normal monsters.  <span>Neat Plays You Can do with this deck:</span>  <span>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=707731-24882478 </span>  <span>Anything you want to ask about this deck, join my discord server:</span>  https://discord.gg/yxCsb2Egz8  Hopefully you have lots of fun, feel free to leave any suggestions but I do believe this is the format for this deck since it has got everything combat the current meta game."

Dogmatika is very consistent and Albaz gives it a strength to remove enemy cards easily  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>Fleurdelis:</strong> Easy to invoke + Negation is easily searchable with Ecclesia or Ash  <strong>Maximus:</strong> 1 for 2  <strong>Albaz: </strong>Core of the deck, easy fusion in any turn is quite good and synergy with most things  <strong>Ecclesia:</strong> Searcher  <strong>Armageddon: </strong>Send Albaz to the GY to be used later  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Splind: </strong>You can use the opponent's weak monsters - Give a destruction every turn  <strong>Brigrand: </strong>Remove Big Monsters - Protect Others  <strong>Ash: </strong>Big Monsters - Even so, you will almost always throw it to look for a monster  <strong>Albion: </strong>Something niche but you can do it yourself - Look for the Spell / Trap  <strong>Skull Knight: </strong>Destroy Monsters  <strong>Skull Wagon: </strong>Destroy Spell / Trap  <strong>N'tss: Immediate Destruction</strong>  <strong>Omega: </strong>Resource Recovery  <strong>Wind Pegasus: </strong>Remove things easily  <strong>Spell/Trap</strong>  <strong>Nadir Servant: </strong>Searcher and Miller (Pretty Ban)  <strong>Fusion Conscription: </strong>Search Albaz for opponent turn  <strong>Stigmata of White: </strong>Like a Fusion Spell also recovery  <strong>Stigmata Ominous Cry: </strong>Reborn the big boys also recovery  <strong>Judgment of Stigmata: </strong>Good destruction also recovery  <strong>Dogmatika Encounter: </strong>Really usefull card to Fusion Summon in opponent turn or recover the dogmatika stuff  <strong>Other Things</strong>  <strong>Ash, Duality, Called, Dragon's Prision,Trap Trick: </strong>Good Staples  <strong>Other Options</strong>  Dogmatika: Ashiyan is easy recover, Adin is a boy for me, Nation is protect, Genesis is a interesting trap, Punishment is  destruction +Mill but blocks extra.  Invoked: You know how this works  The Dragons: Feel free to use more copies for this dragons, personally i think one dragon is ok  Others:Ogre is Staple, Toadally is infinte, Pinpoint dash is really good trap with Dogmatika  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  If you have the option to summon maximus, remember not to mil Ash first because you can also mill it with maximus.  Duality is often used on a turn where you want to use Albaz on the opponent turn.  Stigmata traps are not that great, I usually prefer to use them as Albaz cost.  I need to say how good Encounter is?!?! It's so easy to search, it lets you interrupt plays, Resource Recovery, it's just brutal.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>Kaiju Hero:</strong> It is a deck that I use recently, I think it would be a good idea to upload it.  <strong>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx:</strong> I just saw the card and I loved it, I hope to find a way to use it in a deck.  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> Crystal girl is good at True Draco, I'm not a fan of this one but I liked the combination.  <strong>Remake of the Best Fusion Deck:</strong> With the new Fossil suport, my Fusion Toolbox looks better, I'll only want to see if Invoke dogde this next banlist.  &nbsp;  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to help."

Easy to get Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon on the field by using a White Stone set face down or a Dragon Spirit already on the field. The Kaijus make it easy to get rid of a big threat on your opponents side of the field. You can pair both Saryuja and RedMD  to special summon twice per turn to potentially OTK your opponent."

Fairly new to yugioh but I'm just applying what I've learned from videos and other ,"I tried to avoid bricky starting hands as much as possible, but I guess that's pretty hard to do with a dark magician deck. I believe it just follows standard Dark Magician meta: I will usually use Magician's Rod to search for Dark Magical Circle unless I see a potential combo (?) for Secrets of Dark Magic to then activate another spell for the draw effect, or if I can use Magicians' Soul to send a Dark Magician/Girl to the GY then I'll search Soul Servant for the extra draw(s) (honestly even if I'm not using  Magician's Rod to search that I will usually try to do that Soul Servant move anyways if I don't know what else to play). I will also use the Rod to search for Eternal Soul or Navigation if I already have a Dark Magician in my hand/GY and a Dark Magical Circle on the field.  If I don't have Dark Magical Circle readily accessible then I try to use Bond Between Teacher and Student just to get Dark Burning Magic (hence my 1 copy of Dark Magician Girl). Usually in this case I would have used Magicians' Soul to get my Dark Magician on the field. If I have Eternal Soul out at that point then I will almost always use Secrets of Dark Magic if I can, just in case the Eternal Soul gets destroyed.  If I can't get a combo started I special summon Apprentice Illusion Magician, just to get Dark Magician in my hand at least and just barely reduce my chances of getting a bricky draw on the next turn, but sometimes I also use her discard effect to send a Dark Magician to the GY and then use Soul Servant to get another draw (usually to search and draw Eternal Soul or Dark Magical Circle if I already have Eternal Soul). Otherwise, she's a way for me to at least get a monster on the field. As for my other spells, I use 1 copy of  The Eye of Timaeus to use Dark Magician the Dragon Knight (or the DMG version if I am absolutely desperate I guess) and 1 Illusion Magic for chain blocking or just a way to get Dark Magician into my hand, as well as 1 Magicalized Fusion for an emergency fusion though I will usually try to save it for Quintet Magician.  For traps I will of course abuse the living heck out of Eternal Soul and Magician Navigation with Dark Magical Circle for the banish during my opponents turn as soon as they summon a threatening monster or use a scary spell (will usually use Navigation first to get a negate set up on my next turn and also because Eternal Soul is a little risky, but I'll use Eternal Soul if I have to summon from the GY). I feel like 2:2 is a pretty decent ratio for that? I do pretty decently with that at least. I also do 2:2 for Solemn Judgment and Solemn Strike. I only use Strike for interrupts and Judgment (usually) if I feel like the card they just played could potentially dismantle my board, which usually just means I keep Judgment there to protect Eternal Soul. I play 2:2 for Infinite Impermanence and Ash Blossom for my standard handtraps (I used to run Imperm at 3 but it's been feeling kind of useless lately. Finally for the traps I used 3 Crackdowns cause I've found those to just be stupid useful stall cards. I usually wait until they summon a Link/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz monster thats pretty powerful or has a scary effect and then I steal it right away, and it's also useful for my link summons.  For my extra deck, I will usually go for Ebon Illusion Magician for the additional banish effect, for a pretty fun (and I'd imagine annoying) double banish if I have Dark Magical Circle out. Or if I'll do that link climb I learned from Team Samurai's video using Dracossack to for the 2 tokens &gt; I:P Masquerena &gt; Knightmare Unicorn (then use the discard effect if I can) &gt; Accesscode Talker for banish and then OTK if I can. I learned that Geonator Transverser is a potential out to Red-Eyes Dragoon from one of Trif's videos, but I haven't had the chance to use it yet in case I ever need to summon Magicians' Soul for the draw effect without any plans to link climb (which I haven't done yet but its there just in case), and I also have the same mentality for Link Spider. Lastly I have Predaplant Verte Anaconda in case I need to copy Magicalized Fusion for an emergency fusion (I'm almost certain it can be used for Quintet Magician if I have enough spellcasters in the GY but I haven't been able to use to use that yet).  As you can see, I'm not using a spellbook engine so I'm not using Crowley, although if you guys think I should switch some cards out for a spellbook engine, as I said in the short deck summary I am fairly new to yugioh so I would appreciate any possible tips for improvement. Also since I am pretty new, I only know cards from other deck profiles and cards that I've encountered in duels. I have considered throwing in a copy or 2 of Foolish Burial Goods for my Soul Servants but I'm not 100% on which cards I want to switch out. Anyways thanks for taking the time to read all this if you got this far."

The Ligthsworn engine gets cards in the grave, like Breakthrough Skill and Eldlich support cards since they have grave effects. Raiden, Lyla, and Lumina are the only Lightsworns you need, Lyla to pop back rows if any but she is a decent 4-star beatstick that mills, Raiden mills, and is a 4-star tuner for Synchro plays.

Its mostly played against Rogue and in Casual Play. I try may best to make the Deck as good as possible. Work,"Hey Guys,  this is my attempt to create a solid Deckprofile for casual play. I might say that im not used to play with a side Deck so I tried this Deck as versatile is i could. E.g. I run book of moon, cause it can work going first and going second. I run 6 going second cards, which also work against many Decks. I dont play against Drytron or VW. Its mostly rogue.  The Deck is really consistent as it is. Ofc if you draw 5 Live Twins you brick, but the numbers are all pretty well chosen. I tried many ratios and i like this the most. You could run 3 Nadirs cause it is broken, but I dont have a third copy IRL.  Atm I run Zeus in the Extra, because I dont think the Evil Twins are that good going second. The only Problem is you need to get your normal summon out. The Spell doesnt help there sadly.  For the people that like playing 40 cards straight, you may cut Pankratops, cause he is just a brick going first. Or cut the Secret Password or one Book of Moon  Maybe I should talk about my choice of the Black Eldlixir. I have chosen it, cause it helps me to get consistent hands. White Eldlixir often feels like a brick if drawn, else it just helps the grind game. I see that the Black Eldlixir is dead if both copies of Eldlich are in the grave, but i try too utilies my Eldlich in the grave the most, to play around Ice Dragons Prison.  About Combos, there isnt much in this Deck, you play the hand as you get it. Remember to use the Dogmatika cards at the end. Also there are very many cards that lock you in Types or Archetypes, watch out for them to play in the right order.  A good two card Combo is a Live Twin and Eldland in hand. Sadly you dont get the drawcause you pop your Eldland, but you have the Evil Twins and Conquistador/Haquero live.  As discard you mostly like to use the golden Lord, or an Eldlich spell/trap.  Link Spider and Almiraj are there to fix really bad hands and to get a monster from the Extra Deck out for Ecclesia. They both can be cut for Knightmare Gryphon and Omega for example.

Watch the video for combo tutorial. Colossus is banned on TCG tho, so sad. If you wanna splash it to another deck, just use that Halq lineup + Dragondark, Dragonhawk, and Colossus, you'll end up with the same board.  If you're new to the Thunder Dragon playstyle, the aim is to summon Colossus/Titan and gotta max out the ratio for Dragonhawk, Dragonroar, Dragondark, and regular Thunder Dragon, don't forget to play the Thunder Dragon Fusion spell too. Then you can play the rest of Thunder Dragon cards at 1 or 2 copies. The support usually used is Allure of Darkness, Gold Sarcophagus, Batteryman Solar/Aloof Lupine, Chaos Space (and its target like Wyverbuster/Collapserpent), and lastly Verte Anaconda/Cross-Sheep.  Pros: New fun approach of Thunder Dragon and splashable.  Cons: Weaker than the Chaos version, Colossus is banned in TCG."

First of all it was ahead of its time with a brillant  remover, a non-targeting  and non-destruction  remover. Second of all it’s a OTK machine that was getting better and better along these years, and was a shame to not get a structure deck in the 2019 poll (losing to Shaddol, Sacred beast and now infamous  Charmer deck). I personally find it a little difficult to play with this deck, ‘cause it has so many lines to play that I got confused (although i’m not a very smart girl). But here we are with a lot of new supports, infinite lines to play and a deck so sweet that might cause diabetes to your opponents.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Disclaimers</i></b></span>  <span>When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no Access code talker. However  I hope you like my choices for certain cards and if you have any questions or tips, please message me.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Starters</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a>: </b><span>this cute girl can tribute herself to summon any madolche monster from the deck, preferable </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span> to start her combo because she was a special summon or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span> to extend your plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>: </b><span> a newcomer where the new broken combo resides. This little girl can special summon herself from your hand with you having no monster in your GY and, in top of that, summon another madolche from your deck but this monster will have 1 level less than the original . The way that she can trigger her second  effect by any special summon is insane, so if she was summon  by  </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span>  you also would summon another Madolche monster , like </span><span> </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> </b><span> for instance to proceed to XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a>: </b><span>A great helper to “debrick” your hand, especially if you have another madolche in hand or you have </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span>to capitalize on that.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x</b> <b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>:  </b><span>The primary function of this owl is to summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a> </b><span> to start your combos  and put some protection , but it can  maybe summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>to use some different line of plays.

The intention of this deck as you may have guessed is to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. However, this deck has more potential than that. In addition to being able to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, the deck can also take advantage of the Dark Magician Archetype. If done correctly the deck can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode and if that's not bad enough for your opponents because the deck runs a lot of spellcasters you can also abuse Secret Village of the Spellcasters. But, do keep in mind although the deck is powerful much of its power can only be taken advantage of if going first. So if you're in a match make sure to include things like Kaijus and Dark Ruler No More in the sideboard to ensure you have a way of getting past your opponent's negates. Furthermore, don't be afraid of discarding Assault Mode Activate for Magicians' Souls' effect there are three in the deck for a reason. Lastly, be careful with Assault Sentinal make sure you've summoned whatever non-synchro monsters from the extra deck that you need before his ability to maximize your strategies and optimization. Other than that I hope you enjoy the deck and if possible do help with any advice you have on how the deck may be improved."

Viabi,"This is a currently experimental build of an idea I saw someone talking about Rikka as potentially quality deck with some of the plant support.  There was a note that it would likely be better once the Sunvine and Sunavalon cards come, but I had restricted myself to just TCG legal cards to see how the deck performs as of this moment to see where problems lay.  Overall this is a general rundown as to what is possible, but it is still a quite early stage of experimentation and further work is likely able to be done in order to be able to refine them.  As an example, this did start as a more pure Rikka deck and had the Aroma aspects slightly splashed in and another direction may find better strength. <p><span>The Good Stuff</span></p> 1 - Lonefire Blossom, Evil Thorn, and Aromaseraphy Jasmine all have their effects cost in the form of tributing.  This allows for all of these to be used for the from hand special summon of Primula the Rikka Fairy, from graveyard special summon of Erica the Rikka Fairy, and, while not requiring tributes, the from hand special summon of Rose Girl.  Evil Thorn in turn has first turn synergy with Aroma Laurel with its overall minor 300 damage effect dropping your opponent's life points down and thereby allowing the special summon requirements of Laurel to be fired off, and as it is a One for One target you can set up for the Erica play by sending that card to the grave for cost.  The boards set up through this method are able to go into a wide variety of levels, as if you end up with an optimum board from a one for one where you can have 5 materials on board without an expended normal summon.  With two expended for an Aromaseraphy Jasmine who in turn uses its own tributing effect, you can special summon a Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy that is able to level manipulate your whole board into multiple Ranks of near your choice.  2 - Rikka Petal can allow for a once per turn for up to 3 turns Rank 8 plant monster when combined with Rose Girl.  It achieves this through using its effect to be special summoned from grave on your opponent's end phase, using Rose Girl's return to hand effect along with normal summoning it, using Rikka Petal's search effect to get Mudan the Rikka Fairy, using Petal as material for Mudan's special summon, searching Rikka Glamour using Mudan's effect, tributing either Mudan or Rose Girl for Rikka Glamour's double search, searching Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy and Hellebore the Rikka Fairy, then using the other for Snowdrop's special summon of itself and another plant monster.  Notably, this line can stop even before Mudan for Rank-2, or 2 rank increase, Link plays.  Aromaseraphy Angelica and Erica the Rikka Fairy can both be added into this once to replace Rose Girl so it is not needed to expend your normal summon for the play.  3 - Rose Bell of Revelation allows for the searching of both the Attack Increase effect of Erica the Rikka Fairy, and the limited Effect Veiler-style effect of Hellebore the Rikka Fairy, along with setup for a special summon on the next turn.  4 - Their rank 8 that is quite easy to make with the deck thanks to Snowdrop makes use of tributing removal in a quick effect form thanks to the requirements for turning it into a quick effect being the usage of plant-type monsters as material.  5 - Any effect that is non-destruction negation upon your monsters can be pushed through decently as it will leave behind a plant-type that is able to be used as material for further plays either from tributing for a special summon or for extra deck plays. <p><span>Issues</span></p> 1 - For a lot of the deck's plays, you effectively need to expend your entire starting hand and this can leave you with very limited options if your board is broken.  Aromage Jasmine and Aromaseraphy Jasmine both grant effects to draw you cards in soft once per turn fashion, the former blind draws and the latter searching plant monsters, but life point gain may not always be available.  2 - Second turn plays can be a bit of an issue as this deck calls for tribute fodder for its effects to go off, and at times you can be stuck with lines that leave you with very few monsters on board that mean you might only be able to end off with just 1 extra deck monster on board.  This especially becomes the case if you don't have Rose Girl, Primula, or a Erica in grave, or a way in hand to be able to tribute a card off the field to get off their effects, and further becomes a problem if you've gone through the Evil Thorns.  3 - A lot of effects restrict you to plant-type summons, which poses a problem when it comes to the extra deck as there are not too many good plant type options at the moment.  One of the big ones is that there are no instant fusion targets, as Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss is the only level 5 or lower plant and it has a requirement of needing NEX to summon, that makes the Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio into Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra quite a shaky point beyond its addition to the issues it has with the prior mentioned hand issues.  Super Polymerization will not solve this either as much of the deck is composed of water attribute plants which would not be able to go into the Predaplant fusions using what you have.  Sunavalon may help with allowing for this to solved, but that needs testing.  The list below maintains a list of the current good extra deck monsters that work with the set main deck.  4 - If you want multi-turn recovery, deck space is extremely tight and this only becomes worse when trying to get hand traps into the mix.  This is why the list below has a 60 card main deck.  5 - This can fight through some hand traps, but it is a bit card dependent and while Nibiru does spawn a token, it is not a plant-type that several of the special summon effects require in order to be able to go off."

Once you summon Blue-Eyes Chaos Max, IA is unable to do anything against it. Also, if you don't manage to get the resources to turbo Chaos Max, the deck can still pull through by using a primitive Dragon Link-type strategy.  Ritual engine consists of exactly 15 cards, which could be replaced by the side deck to turn this deck a more pure Blue-Eyes Dragon Link build.  Any suggestions are welcome."

Well, let's get on the topic at hand shall we? , this is my modified Ancient Gear deck that has a lot of control potential(as far as Ancient Machinery with Tony Stark's girl version goes) and can otk easily as well, it just depends on your grip, here is the introduction to the deck's strategy and cards that are included in it:  &nbsp;  Main Deck  Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon: He is a target for both Ancient Gear Catapult and Geartown, can control the field against control decks by popping off their spells and traps one by one, has a big attack power and can defend your field as well, plus it is a Earth Machine monster and it will come to importance later.  Ancient Gear Golem: The old school Ancient Gear, brings memories doesn't?, it is the primary target for both Ancient Gear Catapult and for Ancient Gear Fusion as the first lets you summon it from deck ignoring his conditions and the latter gets stronger by it being on the field, it is self explanatory though, it can punch, can pierce and can help you otk, it is one of my favorites(not because i have one Ultimate First Ed of it...ok, maybe a little because of that).  Ancient Gear Wyvern: It is one of the best cards you can normal summon, it can search a lot of good cards, is an earth machine, can search Ancient Gear Box and is summonable via Geartown, just be careful with it as for the rest of the turn you search with it you cannot set cards so set them beforehand.  Ancient Gear Frame: It is there just because it can be searched via box and has a nice search effect that can get Ancient Gear Fusion directly from the deck for you, it is a nice option but far from perfect, it is also a earth machine.  Sky Striker Ace - Raye: She is almost perfect as access any of her armors which can set up strategies, protects you and she is a Loli, one of the best normal summons of the deck.  Ancient Gear Box: Well, it can search Ancient Gear Frame and serve as fusion material, it is a nice inclusion but don't run too many, one is enough as it can(and will) be searched by Ancient Gear Wyvern.  Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: Can be a niche normal summon as it can deal burn damage and allow an easy Ancient Gear Howitzer, can be searched by Ancient Gear Wyvern as aforementioned.  Ash Blossom: Do i really need to explain?, She is a hand trap slot(can be switched by any other relevant HT of the format).  Overload Fusion: Predaplant Verte Anaconda's favorite target, easily allows for a second Chaos Ancient Gear Giant.  Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves: This can pop both your opponent's spell and trap cards and can be used to pop your Geartown(300 IQ) and depending on the situation, a monster your opponent controls, this is what i would call synergy.  Ancient Gear Catapult: Can enable any Ancient Gear from deck(even Ancient Gear Golem) and can pop both Geartown and Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero to summon a Sky Striker Ace - Raye that can help you set up more, also remember the GY effect as it will help you set up plays.  Ancient Gear Fusion: Will summon your extra deck options which include Chaos Ancient Gear Giant and Ancient Gear Megaton Golem.  Pot of Avarice: Will reset your Sky Strikers, draw 2 and get back some resources into the deck.  Terraforming: A fourth copy of Geartown and a third copy of Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero.  Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones: Can summon a ""Raye"" to the field that is never a bad this, specially for no normal summon at all and can even protect you from an otk while you're setting up yours.  Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor: It is obviously a great card as it can help you both in the control aspects of the deck as it can help you steal and/or negate anything on the field, with so many V.F.Ds running around this is a great addition to this deck.  Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole: It can further improve this deck's control aspects and can protect your Sky Striker cards, can also send cards to the GY like the Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero.  Ancient Gear Fortress: A one of, why?, it limits what you can summon when it activates her effect, she can protect your Ancient Gears and also can revive an Ancient Gear like Wyvern from the GY, a good card, not great, not bad, just good.  Geartown: A card to destroy whenever you have the chance, she is basically an enabler ""for free"", can net almost any Ancient Gear from deck with the exception of Ancient Gear Golem.  Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero: Can possibly search any Sky Striker Card but also be sent to the GY via this deck's various ways to do this to summon a Raye from deck to make Kaina as she is an Earth Machine, combo potential basically.  Infinite Impermanence: A hand trap slot but also works as a pseudo Widow Anchor, nifty isn't it?  &nbsp;  Extra Deck  Chaos Ancient Gear Giant: The main boss monster of this deck as it is a powerhouse, can attack a lot of times, easily access an otk via himself and has spell and trap protection, you must run this card and he is the main objective and wincon.  Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: A good option, a powerhouse as well, can be dangerous for your opponent but he will probably be summoned mostly via Ancient Gear Megaton Golem's effect.  Ancient Gear Megaton Golem: Speaking of the devil, it is just a second option if you can't make enought resources for Chaos Ancient Gear Giant, and can also summon Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem just incase.  Ancient Gear Howitzer: A surprisingly good card as it can help you defend yourself from your opponent as he is unaffected to card effects and can summon ANY Ancient Gear from the deck, even Golem, can also help you win in time just like Hunting Hound.  Ancient Gear Ballista: Combo enabler, remember that i mentioned a lot of times earth machines?, well here is the purpose of it, it can be summoned to combo off, enable otks, search cards, it is a really solid card and is part of the many combos that involve Raye as Kaina herself is also an earth machine.  Sky Striker Ace - Zeke: Just a name really, she can help you send things to the GY but that's it, you won't be going too much into her except in the case you want to Avarice, ok she can banish threats away but...your main wincon is hitting monsters your opponent controls with your powerhouses, a bit self countering isn't it?.  Predaplant Verte Anaconda: My precious plant will enable the double otk with two Chaos Ancient Gear Giants.  Sky Striker Ace - Hayate: Basic Sky Striker playstyle stuff, can send any Sky Striker card to the GY, be it Raye for protection, be Widow Anchor to grab with Kagari, it's really up to you and situation dependant, can also help you win on time(Yay?).  Sky Striker Ace - Kaina: She is really good in this deck as she is both an earth machine and can hold your opponent's monsters from an attack.  Sky Striker Ace - Kagari: Can recover any Sky Striker spell from your GY, can basically search alongside Hayate's effect, good card and the only extra deck monster besides the AG link and boss at 2.  Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku: Can search stuff, weakens opponent's monsters, help protect the field, another good Sky Striker card.  &nbsp;  Side Deck's Obligatory Card:  Run 3x copies of Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburner as it is exchangeable with Jamming Waves, basically does the same thing but is match dependant.  Strategy: It aims to control the gamestate with the Sky Striker half while setting up the Ancient Gear half for an easy and fast otk your opponent won't be prepared, the surprise factor is important here as you can change the playstyle on the fly.  -END OF THE LIST-  &nbsp;  Well this is it, the end of my deck profile and if you want to ask something, just go and do it, i will answer it when i get the chance to."

He can bring back one of the monsters you tributed for him, and when he's sent from field to grave he can fetch you a spell or trap that lists ""Possessed"" in its name.  Zoodiac engine also helps to set up plays. Any Zoodiac monster = Drident, and can help you get to your ideal board. Of which, is Drident + I:P Masquerena and 2 set backrow. Ratpier (or Tenki to search up Ratpier) + Jester Confit or Performage Hat Tricker, along with Spirit Charmers, equals your end board.  Two card combo example. Cards in hand: Ratpier, Performage Hat Tricker and Spirit Charmers + 2 cards in hand.  NS Ratpier - &gt; dump Zoodiac - &gt; xyz into Tigermortar - &gt; xyz into Chakanine - &gt; act.

Plus, this card acts as a substitute to summon the almighty ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"", so if you only have two ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"" cards in your hand, you do not have to wait to summon the fusion monsters. The deck also uses ""Dragon's Mirror"" in order to save resources, by using monsters in your GY to summon. ""Gravekeeper's Spy"", ""Magical Merchant"" and ""Morphing Jar"" will speed up the summoning process. They'll allow you to slim the deck down and gain field control very easily. After you summon your dragons, ""My Body as a Shield"" protects you from your opponent, as it stops their attempts to destroy your monsters. Once you get ""Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon"" out, you should have control of the game. For one, the card has potentially more than 3,000 attack points, and any effect that targets him is negated. Save ""My Body as a Shield"" for unique situations in which you may be in a sticky situation.  If you don't have all the cards in your deck, its easy to substitute some of the cards. ""Luster Dragon"" and ""Skilled Dark Magician"" are good trades for ""D.D. Assailant"" and ""D.D. Warrior Lady"". The key to winning with this deck is to outplay your opponent by maintaining field control. Powerful monsters will help you achieve this. Have fun dueling!"

Top in remote duel invite.,"To be honest this deck was mainly made to counter drytron. You want to go first with this deck but the zoo part of it does help when going second. When going first you want to try to set up a board playing under nib. What I always tried for was a 1 material drident + Smiorgh+ barrier statue + back row or hand trap. The one material drident is killer if they do not have some sort of negate because you can pop their normal summon when they go to attack the barrier. Simorgh protecting against targeting was way more important then I thought it would be and it caused ALOT of problems for people. I played book of moon and crackdown for a similar reason as the drident, mess up their normal summon during the battle phase or main phase if need be. If this goes as planned it is normally decently easy to otk on turn 3. In the end phase if simorgh is still on the field you can search nervall because he is a wing beast. When it comes back to your turn you should have a board set up in way where you should be able to get out doom eagle with no monsters in your opponents gy so it will have 4800 atk. With this you should have at least 4800+2400+1000 from the statue or a final attack from another monster. This deck did great against everything except virtual world but that was expected since they have wind special summons. I would probably take out the megaclopis for another zeus in this format. Also, harpie conductor is VERY important. She allows you to go into simorgh with kerras is need be. Overall very happy with how this deck played but I think the pure harpie version (with harpies feather storm) will end up being better. I am giong to try to keep a small zoo package in if I have room."

The strategy is simple, but requires to be aware of the levels of the monsters, as UMI reduces every water monster level by 1, so the timing and the calculation of levels to summon XYZ/Synchro is essential.  The idea is a control Deck based on summoning Legendary Fisherman 3 alongside with UMI and Sea Stealth Attack. Also playing with Bahamut Shark/Toadally Awesome and some Synchro summons according to the cards you get.  Once you get UMI, LF3, Sea Stealth Attack and Tornado Wall you can attack your opponent endlessly and making your LF3 remove that turn so your cards can't be destroyed and can't lose points because of Tornado Wall. Only weakness to this strat are returning to the hand effects.  Some example combo:  -Going second: Set Sea Stealth Attack, use UMI, then summon Codarus along Silent Angler/Tin Goldfish, activate Codarus effect to send 2 opponent's cards to the graveyard and UMI. Next Summon Bahamut Shark/ Toadally Awesome. Finally on your opponent's turn activate Sea Stealth Attack to get back UMI to the field.  -Marincess Coral Anemone: If you have UMI and Sea Stealth Attack, you can activate the effect of MCA to get back one water monster from your graveyard. Then in your opponent's turn use the effect of SSA to remove MCA, and then when she appears again, put her in a different monster zone where she can summon another monster according to her link.  -With Bahamut Shark you can summon Toadally Awesome to have a negate, Tri-Edge Levia if you want to remove a destroyed monster, or Full Armored Black Ray Lancer if you want to destroy a Magic/Trap card after destroying a monster. After that you can use Bahamut as Link material, because it can't attack the turn you used its effect to summon. Bahamut Shark is the main card of the deck, and you will always want to summon it."

","First there are several combos with this deck but you need to know the basics.  All the trap cards (except karma cut) are meant to be destroyed by Serziels effect or another and the true best field is Link 4 Abomination and Serziel equipped with either evil eye equip spell (use Gorgone is Life Points are lower than opponent) with a few xyz monsters just in case.  Combo 1: Evil eye domain/Serziel + Any unchained Spell/Trap= Use domain to get Serziel, Summon her and search for Evil Eye Selene( if lp lower than opponent use Gorgone) and equip. Set unchained Spell/Trap and if opponent has special summoned monster destroy. During standby phase destroy set spell/trap and summon Unchained soul to the field----Easy 3k damage monster that can destroy any card on field(effect) and way to destroy special summons.  Combo 2: Tour guide = One card combo here, summon tour guide and now you have a choice, either summon Basilius, link summon Gorgon and equip Evil Eye spell/ summon Basilius the same but xyz summon to get pure power 3k damage dealier/ or summon any unchained monster and link summon Soul of rage and next turn use opponents monster to link summon Soul of Anguish.  The extra link and xyz monsters add extra versatility in case you need to switch up and good hands to draw. Feel free to add you own twists to the deck, if you want to cheapen the cost the knightmare cards aren't needed and you can sub karma cut for any hand trap you feel is good.

The main Endboards are:  Seal + Dragoon + Savage  Apollousa ( 2-3) + Dragoon + Savage  This Deck is focused to compete in Meta gameplay, so I prefered a build that plays 40 cards, I ended on 41 though. You can cut 1 Noctovision Dragon if you really want to play 40 cards. Only Handtrap is Gamma, and I am playing Forbidden Droplet in the Main Deck as another go 2nd card. Feel free to switch those cards for the ones you prefer.  I really wanted to play some more going 2nd cards, but could just not find the space, so for no I'll go with these.  Saryuja can be a pretty nice extender, if you're sure your opponent does not have a handtrap. It is really nice, if you use your second search with Black Metal dragon to get the Vanilla Red-Eyes and just put it back with Saryuja later on.  &nbsp;"

I will tell you why I choose all these cards:  <strong>Main deck (40):</strong>  <strong>Monsters(17):</strong>  3x - <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza:</strong> The main start of this deck, you get him out as a huge beatstick after Banishing your entire deck, it doesn't matter if your cards are face-down or face-up while Banish. It gets 400 x any cards banished, whether or not is your cards or your opponent's. It is a 3 star so it is easy to normal summon but it lacks protection.  3x - <strong>Necroface: Necroface:</strong> is a perfect target for <strong>Allure of Darkness </strong>and <strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong>. Why? Because if it is banished, you and your opponent have to banish the top 5 cards from their deck. Also since you are going to be banishing a lot of cards and in order to recycle your whole deck, you can normal summon it and it turns into a huge beatstick based on how many cards being shuffled back into the deck x 100.  3x - <strong>Eater of Millions: </strong>you special summon this by banishing cards from your extra deck, or from hand/field face down and it gains x 100 for each card's banished face-down. It is also a good floodgate control to banish your opponent's problematic monsters by banishing them facedown, and the only true way for your opponent to really get rid of it is by non-target removal/effect removal, attacking it twice (losing 1 monster while they are at it), negate its effects/summoning.  3x - <strong>D.D. Scout Plane:</strong> you get this little guy banished face-up, he is basically your T<strong>reeborn Frog</strong> that comes around during the End Phase, the downside it will come back in attack position but it helps you get some short of field presence when need it and a good target to banish with <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>.  3x - <strong>Battle Fader:</strong> you aren't playing many monsters and you might banish your key cards. It is also a good stall option that banishes itself or used as link plays if it lives.  2x - <strong>Gizmek Orochi</strong>: you can special summon this on your opponent's turn by banishing 8 cards and it banishes 1 card they control face down by banishing 3 cards from your extra deck. It can also special summon itself from the grave which is also useful.  <strong>Spells(16)</strong><strong>:</strong>  3x - <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>: you are running a lot of dark monsters, and you don't really mind banish them. Helps with the consistency of your deck.  3x - <strong>Pot of Desires: </strong>Same reason as <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>, it adds consistency, and your monsters benefit from cards being banished faced-down.  1x - <strong>Pot of Extravagance:</strong> Same reason as <strong>Pot of Desires </strong>but I only suggest one of, because it hinders your other draw power cards.  3x - <strong>Pot of Duality:</strong> You aren't going to be special summon that much in this deck, but getting out key cards faster is important.  1x - <strong>Upstart Goblin:</strong> makes you have a 39 card deck, and the downside isn't minimal when you can drop 8000 atk or higher <strong>Gren Maju</strong>.  1x - <strong>One Day of Peace:</strong> It is a good stall card, though it gives your opponent a +1, it is more for consistency.  1x - <strong>Called By The Grave:</strong> just get rid of Hand Traps or banishing a card from your opponent's deck.  1x - <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster:</strong> you don't have much protection from backrow, there are few decks that do run backrow so is better safe than sorry.  1x - <strong>Gold Sarcophagus</strong>: Banish your <strong>Necroface </strong>and watch your opponent cry, it is your <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>.  1x - <strong>Dimensional Fissure: </strong>This deck needs cards to be Banished and it is a perfect anti-meta card, sadly you can only run 1.  <strong>Traps (7):</strong>  1x <strong>Macro Cosmos: </strong>Same reason as <strong>Dimensional Fissure.</strong>  3x <strong>Evenly Matched: </strong>""At the end of the Battle Phase, if your opponent controls more cards than you do: You can make your opponent banish cards from their field face-down so they control the same number of cards as you do. If you control no cards, you can activate this card from your hand."" You need this for your deck, sadly if you are trying to build this deck, it is more pricy at the time writing this, it is around $23. But it might get a reprint soon. You can look up alternatives for this card, and you don't 100% need it. It is nice to have.  3x <strong>Solemn Judgment:</strong> Getting rid of problematic cards.  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  Your extra deck is pretty much filler, The only cards that are worth running for my take are <strong>Linkuriboh, Relinquished Anima, Knightmares. </strong>I have <strong>Staving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> because I side deck <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> and <strong>Radian.</strong>  <strong>Side Deck (15):</strong>  I am still experimenting what to side so it is up to you."

Key cards: Nekroz of Areadbahair(For monster effect negation, either tribute itself, or if there's monsters in hand, use those to keep it on board), Drytron Mu-Beta Fafnir(preferably summoned with 5 mats so even after summoning the 2 rituals, it still has a s/t neg), Drytron Gamma Eltanin(Main Xyz enabler, helps to set up board), Zeta aldibah and alpah thuban to search out the ritual monsters/spells, delta altais for additional draw power(beta rastaban is really for recovery purposes after the usage of one of the drytron ritual monsters, so not as important). 1 of of both drytron rituals(draconids is better for first turn, and beta rastaban can recycle the cards used by draconids back to the graveyard while getting a body on board, but as quadrantids is perfectly serviceable, as it floats into 2 of the main deck, non ritual drytons in gy upon destruction, or into mu-beta fafnir, as it's also a 2k drytron monster).  I'm using 3 of the ritual spells due to their recursion+searchability(via aldibah and the field spell). So naturally, I'm running 3 copies of drytron fafnir due to its search capability+(minor) disruption ability(level reduction), 3 copies of nova(once-per turn deck summon of a main deck, non ritual drytron monster) and 3 copies of meteor shower.  Staple cards:  Metaverse/Terraforming to search out fafnir  3 Where arf thou?/ 3 Cyber emergency to search out the main deck/non ritual drytrons(cyber can search rituals as well, but preferably use it to search the non rituals)  3 Infinite Impermiance(potential omni neg/ useful 2nd turn card)  1 called by the grave(In 2021 ocg its semi limited, so put 2 if possible)  1 Monster reborn(no need for explanations here)  (I didn't put ash, but use it if necessary).  Extra deck  3 copies of mu-beta fafnir(enables easier ritual summons/provides st neg)  3 copies of sylvan princesssprout(search+dump)  2 copies of anima and linkuriboh(monster removal+recursing attack interceptor)  1 of Knightmare pheonix,unicorn and cerberus(feel free to use other generic links)  1 copy of assembled nightingale(use as possible alternate wincon+a sticky body)  1 copy of Borrelsword Dragon(I put it in there, but feel free to use other link bosses like appolusa, saros, borreload, etc.)(I've tried Nephthys, the Sacred Flame, and while it was decent, It's actually better to leave the ritual mons on board, so use it at your own discretion.)  Overall, this deck is fairly consistent, as long as you have at least 1-2 copies of the key cards, you can easily go into fafnir with a st neg, and one of the dryton rituals(this is the worst case scenario). Weak against nibiru, as you need to spam ur main deck drytrons, and of course, ash and other handtraps, but due to the stickiness of the drytron monsters you can easily build back your board as long as you have a ritual monster in hand(or a drytron monster).  &nbsp;"

Make use of your ability to swarm the field and shut down the effects of your opponent's ace monsters when you can, and just try and have fun with it - you definitely aren't taking War Rocks anywhere competitive!
