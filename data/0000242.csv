They are an archetype that revolves around special summoning themself from the hand by targeting another Therion monster in the gy and equipping that monster to themself for an attack boost. They are all level 7 or 8 monsters which allows them to go into xyz monsters easily. The Therions themself are nothing to sneeze at either though. King has a negate of any card or monster effect, Lily can search out a Therion spell/trap, bulls can destroy any one card on the field, leaper can bounce any of your opponent's cards, and duke stops your Therion monsters from being destroyed by card effects. All of these effects (except duke) have a cost that is actually beneficial for the archetype.  I am calling it now that this archetype will become meta when it comes to the TCG."

You're not using <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> as a Normal Summon most of the time, since this is more of a Fusion summoning heavy build despite how counter intuitive it might seem, you're using him as a Damage Step hand trap (which stacks with Cyber Dragon Sieger by the way), and since we're running three copies of <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> we don't have to worry too much about not drawing it and also, if it ever so happened that your opponent Nibiru-ed you mid combo, you can cheat out <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>'s effect anyway.

You can basically print Links for free with this deck which is why you can pull out Accesscode Talker for a very strong finisher. The main combo you want to get started on your first turn is as follows: Ideally your starting hand has at least 2 Prank-Kids Cards with one of them being a Monster. Summon your Prank-Kids monster and Link it into Meow-Meow, then after you special summon your next Prank-Kids Monster link those two into Dodo-Doodle-Doo so you can either grab Prank-Kids Pranks if you don't already have it or Prank-Kids Place. after you have Prank-Kids Pranks and Dodo-Doodle-Doo, use Prank-Kids Pranks to summon your Prank-Kid Token and Link into Bow-Wow-Bark. If possible on your first turn you want to fusion summon Weather-Washer pointing off of your Bow-Wow-Bark, and this will be your main Board setup. Having Weather-Washer on the Board will give your Prank-Kids Monsters some form of protection during the Battle Phase. After you have your Board set up you can either summon Accesscode Talker if you think you can finish them off that turn, or if you feel less confident about lethal you can pull out some fusion Monsters to buff up your Monsters from the effect of Prank-Kids Place. Whenever you activate Fansies' effect you want to send Prank-Kids Plan to the Graveyard to Cycle back the Monsters in your Graveyard. Whenever you activate Rocksies' effect you should banish an artifact Monster if there are more than you need in your hand, or a Mirror force if it isn't serving any purpose at the moment. You can swap out the Artifact Monsters for Hand Traps like Cherry Blossom, but I personally just like Artifact Monsters."

They are my first Fusion and Yu-Gi-Oh deck in general in the TCG and I absolutely love how they can grind and control.  <strong>""Why play Pure Shaddolls over Invoked Shaddolls?""</strong>  â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> - <span>He is the main reason as to why. He's a graveyard set up, baits three of the most popular hand traps in the current meta game of Master Duel being <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, he's an EARTH attribute, which means you get access to <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, which also means that you don't have to play <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> if you don't want to. The reason why it's a better bait than <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> is because turn one, passing on <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> is much better than <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, because your opponent's never gonna waste their <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>s, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>s, or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s to negate Shekhinaga's effects and what that allows you to do is to be able to set up your graveyard and your field to actually summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> in response to your opponent's card effects that would either Special Summon another card or the monsters themselves. He also draws you a card if he so happened to be destroyed by battle. All of those, you cannot do in Invoked Shaddolls and would require you to hard draw <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> and <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> to continue your usual play with security. Now how exactly does <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> play around being <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>ed or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>d? If your opponent activates either of those two in response to your <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>'s effect, you can chain <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, or in a mirror match a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to summon an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, effectively dodging the targeting and make the effect still resolve and since you're going second, if your opponent happens to have an on-board response to him, we're playing triple copies of <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> which enables the same play by sending him to the graveyard as cost but can often be better depending on the board state.</span>  â¢ x2 <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> and x1 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> - <span>Now this is the cute part. Due to the presence of triple <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>, people have been playing a lot of Drytrons lately. Now, picture this:</span>  <span>Your opponent sets up their whole board, with their graveyard already filled with Drytrons and Ritual monsters. Your opponent activates Meteonis Drytron in an attempt to summon <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a>. You chain <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> in response (not <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, to play around both <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>) with <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> access, either on board or hand. At this point, you can decide to activate anything else provided that your opponent passes priority. Chain resolves. You will summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a>, which effectively disables their <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a> and Ritual Summoning in general. In a new chain, since you used <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> instead of <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, your <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> will be in the graveyard, allowing you to trigger its effect to banish said <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a> (since all Drytron lists only play one of this), <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>, and one more card of your choice. This list can easily make an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> + <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> set up, so let's assume that you still have it and your opponent still has enough monsters on board to make <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and obviously, your opponent would wanna make him and they did. Upon the resolution of <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>'s effect to gain ATK, Fusion Summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> using either your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> and use its effect to send the said <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> to the GY.</span>  <span>And let me tell you this: This is usually how it plays out against Drytrons going first. <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> going second is actually stronger than <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> in this build. That's just against ONE match up. What it also allows you to do is to have an insurance, if it ever so happens that your opponent banishes both your first <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> because it can actually recur a copy of herself and your <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a>, because losing both of them in itself effectively cripples your grind game. Your two <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>s, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a> are the core of your resource loop, make sure to take good care of them.</span>  â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Shaddoll Construct"">Shaddoll Construct</a> - <span><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> hurts this deck a LOT and if people can run it, they WILL run it, and this card enables you to get around that. That's also why we're using <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, because it plays around said <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, ALSO it terribly hurts Eldlich and other floodgate decks that don't have <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> specifically.</span>  â¢ The Alternative Win Conditions - <span>The choices of Link 4 monsters will be up to your personal preference, and will usually be between either <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> (arguably the weakest of the four, but can still be good situationally), <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> for OTK, or <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>Â for protection. The reason as to why I chose the latter is because it's harder to out than the former three and would specifically require a Kaiju to get rid of, and if they did have a Kaiju, it's also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal. <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> is also a great option for this deck, arguably better than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, especially because we're playing <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a>, because there is a play line that allows you to have access to a set up of <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a>, a set <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a>. What it allows you to do is to continuously loop <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> from the graveyard (in which you summoned during your turn previously) to negate a face-up card on the field, be it an effect monster that can be targeted or an annoying Field Spell/Floodgate, and triggering <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a>'s effect to destroy all monsters on the field whenever a monster is Special Summoned to a ANY zone a Link monster points to, maximum four times per turn only enabled by your set spells and traps and if you're playing <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> instead of <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, not yet including your opponent's Special Summons. <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> also allows it so that he is protected against <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>. I used to do this a lot against Dragon Link and Salamangreat and it's absolutely hilarious.</span>  Overall, it's a pretty straightforward build of Shaddolls and if you might have noticed, this is basically just three Shaddoll Showdown Structure decks with Link Monsters and staples. Enjoy!"

Of the 12 UR's, 5 are free/guaranteed, 2-3 are optional,Â  and only 4-5 are really important and need to be made/found. I don't think I'm super amazing at this game, or that this deck is unbeatable or anything, but its easy to pilot and can get you results up to about plat 4 while being very fun. The main goal of this deck is to go from the Psychic type pilot to the Machine type ships, and then back once the ships are destroyed. This can lead to many interresting plays like ladder combos where you combo a Pilot into another Pilot (repeat as available) into a machine finisher or self destroying ships to bring out one more suited for the current situation.Â  I will start off defining the roles of each card in this deck. I know this is very long, and I do think its worth it to read all of it, but I will be putting tl:dr's for everything right below them so you don't have to do excessive reading if you don't want to.  MAJOR UPDATE 1: I found this deck to be missing draw ability, so I bit the bullet and crafted 3 Pot Of Extravagance's and mill proofed my extra deck by swapping out the filler for more copies of the important stuff. I also dropped 1 Strawman and Bottomless Trap Hole to make room for these PoE's, meaning I'm now at 41 cards. You can choose to keep those in if you like them, since as a pure +1 PoE doesn't really take up deck space in the traditional sense.  MAJOR UPDATE 2: After much deliberation, I have decided to swap out both copies of Fiendish Chain for Lost Wind. This isn't a straight upgrade, as Fiendish Chain's ability to stop attacking is incredibly valuable, but I have decided that the pros of Lost Wind, being its reusability, it not being a continuous trap that will usually become a deadweight row, and ability to make getting over bigger monsters easier, outweigh that one singular advantage for Fiendish Chain. Lost Wind wasn't the only alternative option I considered, as I also looked into Solemn Strike. but due to this deck's budget nature I believe that Lost Wind does an ok enough imitation of Strike to justify passing on the much more expensive Strike (if you have the dust go for Strike though, 1500 life points is basically nothing.)  MAJOR UPDATE 3: Ash is just too good in this format to be only at 1, so I swapped out the last Strawman and one of the Forerunners for two extra copies. Should be pretty obvious why extra copies of Ash are helpful. They were leftovers from another deck I made, but this deck still was able to get to plat without them so if you're really crunched for gems you can survive without them. The other change I made was swapping out one Dogmatika Punishment for the free Lightning Storm. DP is v good and I still love its flexability, but Lightning Storm is one of the best going 2nd cards in the game (which we want to go) and being able to pop front or back row depending on your needs is great, and is a great otk enabler which this deck can do pretty well.  MAJOR UPDATE 4: Rebudgetized the deck, since it was starting to get up there in terms of cost and that was contrary to the stated goal of this deck. The extra deck mostly remade in order to reflect its rarity of use, 2 Ash's were swapped out for Gamma's (which work better in this deck most of the time anyways), and Harpies was swapped back out, leaving Lightning Storm as the primary backrow removal since its given away for free. Adjusted a few other ratios as well.  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a>Â x1</strong>: Driver is a level 6 normal monster with 2500/0. It is only here because Gamma needs it to work. Despite that, if you can get it on your turn its hardly useless, as a 2500 beatstick on player phase is nice, and you can also take it and Gamma and go into links. If at all possible you want Driver to end up in the graveyard before the end of the turn its summoned, as your 2nd Gamma can use him from there but not the banish zone, so ramming it, sacrificing it, or using it as material should always be the priority if you proc it on player phase. Overall a garnet, but as far as garnets go its not the worst. Some people run 2 of this to make sure both their Gamma's will go off, but games don't last that long so I think thats foolish. Run at 1.  Driver tl,dr: Your Gamma's powercell, try and get it in the grave.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a> x3</strong>: Tincan is a level 1 monster with 0/0 that in the endphase, can pay 500 lifepoints to search 3 Kozmo cards from your deck w different names and your opponent blindly picks one for you to add to your hand, and like all pilots you can banish them at basically any point into a higher leveled Kozmo from your hand (Im not gonna mention this effect from now on unless theres smth dif about it for the monster). Tincan is one of your two best no trib options along with Farm Girl, and is going to generally be your best turn 1 option due to being able search without needing to attack unlike Farm Girl. This getting Ashed if you dont already have a ship or Wickedwitch in your hand can be disasterous in predictable ways, but even with the risk of that I'd rather go with this over Strawman, Farmgirl, and Goodwitch even if I'm feeling very cautious because the reward is so high. Theres only a ~33% chance of your opponent having Ash in their opening handÂ  if they're running it at 3 in a 40 card deck, so while it can be anxiety inducing statistically you're probably gonna be fine. Being able to get an untargetable 2800 atk+ beatstick guaranteed with this things effect is really really strong, and if you already have your beatstick ready then going for Kozmotown for banishment returnal, Dark Lady for ladder combos, or Sliprider for backrow removal are nice alternative paths to shoot for. His 0 attack doesn't lend itself to ladder combos nearly as well as Farm Girl's 1500+search does, but being the lowest level pilot means that he will always have something to combo into if you have another Kozmo in your hand which is nice. Can be searched by E Tele, but he should never be the target unless all 5 of your Strawmans and Farmgirls are unavailable somehow. Overall a very strong card that can open up many different routes for you to take.  Tincan tl,dr: Best option for turn 1, usually wanna search Forerunner/Destroyer/Eclipse  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Strawman"">Kozmo Strawman</a> x2 DROPPED TO 1 DROPPED TO 0</strong>: Strawman is a level 2 500/1800 that you can pay 500 lp to return one of your banished Kozmos for a turn with their effect negated before they get thrown back. Honestly in my opinion Strawman is probably the weakest of the no trib Kozmos that I actually use, and with more gems I might swap them out for more copies of Ash or smth, but I wanted more opening board consistency for having something out so its here now and so I'm still gonna go over it. Strawman's return effect isn't super great or useful since Kozmotown does basically the same thing but without effect negation, and the effects are what make these monsters good most of the time. Obviously you're not always gonna have Kozmotown, but this deck already can run generally pretty fine even without Kozmotown so a worse version of that isn't exactly making a great case for it being here. With that being said, a free monster is a free monster, and when you have something that loves clear boards as much as Farm Girl does even a dumb beatstick will be pretty useful at times. Speaking of Farm Girl, being able to ladder into her is another one of his big selling points, and he's the only one with an actual attack stat to be able to do so. 500 chip may not sound like a lot, and it really isnt, but a Straw-Farm-Destroyer combo does 5k which is pretty beefy, and that extra 500 is the difference between being able to kill off of your next from fullÂ  Straw-4 star-Dark Lady-Destroyer ladder vs them living on 4 or 500 lp. This situation doesn't happen a whole lot, especially not with a clear board that Strawman would need to start this combo, but its not the most impossible thing to set up, especially with all the monster removal packed in this deck. It can also be searched by E Tele, but most of the time it's better to go for Farmgirl. Overall not great, feel free to replace imo but its hard to make a truly awful pilot.  Strawman tl,dr: Not a great card and can be replaced, but while it's here recycling from banish for 500 is pretty nice  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a>Â x2:</strong>Â Gamma is a level 2 tuner 1000/0 that can't be normal summoned or set, and has the effect that when your opponent activates a monster effect while you control no monsters, you can negate and destroy that and special summon Gamma and Driver to the field, and then at the end of the turn banish them. This should be Kozmo's hand trap of choice. As an enemy phase card this is straight up better than Ash, as trading the ability to hit spell/traps for the ability to negate any effect and destroy the monster while also fortifying your own board is a trade I am extremely comfortable with making. Because this deck combos vertically instead of horizontally, this card is usually better than Ash on player phase too, as our cards get themselves off the field before their effects, which means if your ship gets popped and you're banishing for a search if it gets Ashed you can continue the search with 3500 damage extra now on the board, usually enough to go for game. This card is semi Ash proof as its effect can be negated by Ash but you don't lose any resources and its not a once per turn, so you can just use it again on the next monster effect your opponent procs. Whether its better to use Gamma on enemy phase or player phase is very matchup dependent, as if theyre ending on something like Apollo then thats free advantage for you on your turn, but if theyre something like tri then popping their normal when it goes to use its link effect can be a huge momentum shift. Since this is a going 2nd deck we have the advantage of knowing the situation better than our opponent, so make sure you're really putting thought as to when best to use this given your hand, your opponents deck, and the current situation.Â  Overall this is an incredible card that feels like it was made for this deck (it can even be searched by E Tele!), def run it at as many copies as are legal.  Gamma tl,dr: Stop plays, get advantage, win games  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Farmgirl"">Kozmo Farmgirl</a> x3</strong>: Farmgirl is a level 3 1500/1000 that if it inflicts battle damage, you can pay 500 life points to add any Kozmo card to your hand. This is the beating heart of the deck. Making clear front rows for her to get a potshot in and start the comboing is the goal of many of the trap cards in the deck. Her being level 3 is an absolute blessing, because that means that its eligible for E Tele, and she will usually be the best target for it in this deck. 1500 atk isn't nothing, but you're usually going to have to rely on traps or a ship to blast open a hole for her to proc her effect, which as I said before isn't super hard to do. Being able to search for ANY Kozmo card from your deck means that it can be easily tailored to fit your current situation, but the most common cards you'll go for are Dark Destroyer for its beefy attack, sometimes its monster removal and recycling effect (that Eclipser doesn't have), Sliprider for when you need a backrow card sniped, Dark Lady for when you already have a beefy ship in the hand and want to ladder, and Kozmotown for when you really just want Kozmotown idk. Now, most combos with this card are very self apparent, since there's really only so much you can do with a single fetch in this deck, but there is one slightly less obvious combo that I wanted to highlight due to its power. The prerequisites for this combo are that you have both Farmgirl and either Tincan/Strawman on the field, no ship in the hand, and a way to get damage with Farmgirl (obviously). This situation can be quite easily set up by either fetching one of these (usually Tincan) with a dying ship's effect on enemy phase and then summoning the other, or just E Tele one and summon the other. After getting the damage with Farmgirl, fetch another Farmgirl and swap her in on top of Straw/Tin, and then potshot with the new Farmgirl and fetch a new ship to go on top of one of the Farmgirls. The strengths of this combo are numerous. First off, its the most damaging combo you can get off of this situation, where you get a minimum of 5100 damage (FG 1 getting over whatever it kills by 100 into making a clear board into Strawman 500 into 2nd FG 1500 into Destroyer 3000) vs 3600 without the extra step. The other very strong result is that you end turn with a Farmgirl on your field. More monsters is always good, and having potential access to her ability again next turn is always good. However there are also 2 things to be weary of with this combo, and those are that you can't activate Farmgirls swapout effect multiple times in one turn, even if there are multiple copies. and also that if you have a ship in the hand just going for a ship search is better. Double ships will be more damaging and leave you with guaranteed swaps on death, which is generally better than what Farmgirl can offer on enemy phase. She's not super amazing for turn 1 since she'll usually be off the board before she has a chance to activate her effect, but she doesn't do it particularly worse than Strawman or Good Witch. If you're really ballsy and the only no trib you draw turn 1 is Farm Girl you could go for the no monster play on t1 to give her the best chance of procing her ability t3 since it absolutely is strong enough to consider, but generally thats not advised for obvious reasons. Overall a very very good card and one of the main ways you will start combos with this deck.  Farmgirl tl,dr: Make an opening for her and she will lead you to victory  <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3 DROPPED TO x1:</strong> Ash is a level 3 0/1800 tuner that you can discard to stop a card effect that would add to hand from deck, special summon from deck, or send a card from the deck to the graveyard. This card does not have the standard upgrade effect of the other pilots in this deck and can't be fetched by E Tele. I was running this card at 1 because I was too broke to run it at 3, and now with the extra materials I've got from playing the game for an extra month or so I've been able to get another 2. One of the best cards in the game and one of player 2's best defenses against the unchecked tyranny of player 1.  Ash tl,dr: It stops plays from your hand  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Goodwitch"">Kozmo Goodwitch</a> x1:Â </strong>Goodwitch is a level 4 1800/1000 that you can pay 500 lp to change one face up monster your opponent controls to face down defense. In theory Goodwitch's effect should be pretty good. Being able to interupt a continuous monster effect that may be giving you problems or get over a beatstick with bad defenses obviously give it usecases, but in practice I really havent found a whole lot of use of it. A lot of things that have continuous effects that you'd like to interupt can't be targeted, and the beefy beatsticks usually either also cant be targeted or have good enough defenses that it wouldn't help a lot in the first place to swap them. This would obviously be much stronger as a quick effect, but it isnt, so theres no use complaining. Can't be fetched by E Tele (nothing from here on can), but you almost never would even if you could. The 1800 atk is nice enough so you can get over stuff if your opponent bricked or smth, but its not really doing much otherwise. Its one of the 2 worst no trib Kozmos I use alongside Strawman, which is why its at 1, but this deck has a lot of stuff that clear front rows so 1800 damage into tag out is pretty alright even if its effect isnt super great.  Goodwitch tl,dr: Effect is mid, but 1800 atk from a level 4 is nothing to scoff at ig.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Wickedwitch"">Kozmoll Wickedwitch</a> x3:</strong> Wickedwitch is a level 4 1900/300 that you can pay 1000 lp during either players turn to make it so this card cant be destroyed by battle or card effects for the rest of the turn. I really like this card. Its the deck's 2nd best turn 1 no trib behind Tincan because its effect will almost guarantee it lives to see turn 2 while dampening whatever damage you'd take by 1900 per attack, which isn't an insignificant amount at all. Its effect also lets it live Tor Trib, which I run at 2 and is something the other pilots don't deal with super amazingly. Even beyond turn 1 it provides good damage and can get overÂ  some stuff. Its effect isn't super team focused or synergistic beyond the TT thing, but who can say no to a good old fashioned lv 4 beat stick in a deck about beatsticking your opponent to death. I think common consensus on this monster is generally mixed to negative, but I like it a lot and am never really annoyed when it shows up in my hand turn 1. I did run this at 2 for a while and it wasn't a super huge deal, but I do like making sure I get my no trib out turn 1 so I switched in a 3rd copy. If you have something you really want to add in here wouldn't be a bad place to make a cut.  Wickedwitch tl,dr: Use its effect to tank stuff and make sure your front row is never empty, strong as a turn 1 play  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Sliprider"">Kozmo Sliprider</a> x2: </strong>Sliprider is a level 5 2300/800 that can destroy 1 spell/trap when it's summoned, and has the first of our ship abilities where when it is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect it can banish itself to summon a lower leveled Kozmo from the deck. Sliprider is pretty good and has a clear usecase: there is an annoying backrow card and you want to get rid of it or you want to preemptively get rid of one. This deck is generally light on backrow removal, with Dogmatika Punishment into N'tss and Harpies Feather Duster being the only other 2 options, so this serves a valuable niche. Its also supremely summonable, being able to be fetched by all the ships (outside Eclipse) and summoned by all the pilots (outside Dark Lady), and if you're in a situation where your effects are being limited it only requires 1 tribute as disgusting as that is to even consider in this deck. The tradeoff for its summonability is that its comboability is gerneally weaker than most other stuff in the deck, but even w that said compared to a lot of stuff outside of the deck fetching a free level 4 or lower on death is very comboable. On its destruction effect for both player phase and enemy phase Wickedwitch is generally going to be your best bet due to its beefiness and survivability, but as always context is king so don't treat that as a hard rule and the other no tribs also all have situations where they should be fetched instead. 2300 atk is nice if you need to attack with this, but generally this card isn't gonna be used for laddering since its the weakest of the 3 ships in this deck by a good margin. This is a good card with common usecases, but due to the decks explosive nature you don't really need to run more than 2 imo. You could easily swap out Dark Eclipser or one of your Forerunners for another one of these if you want more utility over beatsticking, or even drop this to 1 in exchange for a Spell/Trap of your choice if its summonability makes it consistent enough for your preference.  Sliprider tl,dr: Backrow removal that goes into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Dark Lady"">Kozmoll Dark Lady</a> x1 CHANGED TO x2:</strong> Dark Lady is a level 5 2200/1800 that as a quick effect once per turn you can pay 1000 lifepoints to negate the activation of a monster's effect and destroy that monster. Despite being level 5, Dark Lady has the pilot's banish effect rather than the ships. This card is generally pretty niche in its uses, but its very strong in its niches. By default it being level 5 makes it less flexible, but it has the same high amount of summonability as Sliprider so it gets around that quite nicely. Its effect is pretty darn good, obviously being able to neg anything active without a protection effect is very strong, but the problem with this is that most of the effects that give this deck problems are either effect negaters, which are usually either passive or on cards bigger than this. This card has to be used as a an predictive play rather than a reactionary play, because if something that negates effects is going to happen it will be able to negate the pilot's effects that would bring this out, but a 2200 with no protection vs backrow effects doesn't have the greatest shelf life. Despite this bellyaching the effect is still very good, and I have considered even swapping out a Forerunner for another copy of this. This effects is good, but the main draw for this card to me is as the biggest pilot in a ladder combo. Level 5 is a bit of an awkward level to be searching up or down in this deck, but I do think searching up is better for it as it can combo into your untargetable bosses and off itself as the situation demands. As I said before a full ladder of farm-lv 4-lady-destroyer will kill from full, and while this is on the less practical side the shorter farm-lady-bigship combo is incredibly practical and easy to pull off, and deals a fat 6500 minimum. I only ran this at 1 because its easier for this to become a bit of a brick than most other monsters in this deck, but being the difference between a ladder killing from full vs not isÂ  worth making a spot for still and following that logic its generally something I'd like in my hand, so I bumped it up to 2. If I were making cuts I would look elsewhere first.  Dark Lady tl,dr: Good for ladder combos and interrupting combos  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Forerunner"">Kozmo Forerunner</a> x3 DROPPED TO x2:</strong> Forerunner is a level 7 2800/1400 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and heals you 1000 lp during your standby phase. This card has the ship banish effect. This is the first of the boss monsters, and as such its usecase of ""I want a fat unmovable beatstick"" is pretty apparent. Can (and usually will) be comboed into by Dark Destroyer's death effect which makes getting it out plenty easy. 2800 atk is plenty decent and will get it over most non superbosses. The 1000 lp healing is really not super useful unless you're in a crazy stalemate, the lp costs in this deck are very low and almost never come into play. On death I usually go into Dark Lady or Wickedwitch depending on whether it died on player phase or enemy phase. Honestly not a super complicated card, what you see is what you get. I often see this being run at 1 or 2, but I run it at 3 because I value getting out a boss early to punch holes for Farmgirl so for this build in particular I wouldn't suggest going below 2.  Forerunner tl,dr: Untargetable beatstick that can go into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Destroyer"">Kozmo Dark Destroyer</a> x3:</strong> Dark Destroyer is a level 8 3000/1800 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and can optionally target and destroy 1 monster on entry. This has the ship banish effect. This is the Big Boss of the deck, and is usually what you are going to try and go into. Beyond just being an untargetable 3000 beatstick, its on entry effect makes it one of the most versitile cards in the deck. You can pull interesting plays such as bringing it in during the battle phase and proccing its effect on a teammate ship that already attacked to get more damage out of the new monster summoned by the ships banish effect, you can proc its effect on itself and search out Sliprider if you really need a backrow card gone right now, or you could even destroy an opponents monster with it! Dark Destroyer also has the best banish effect of any monster in this deck, giving you the monster of your choice for free. I usually go with Forerunner since that has very similar board presence, but hopefully these writeups will have given you the situations where all the other cards would be useful so you don't just autopilot into Forerunner no matter the situation.Â  This ability doesn't just work on other monsters, but it can also proc on itself. ""But Schwa, why would you want to get rid of your own best monster?"" you may ask. And the answer to that is ""For sick plays."" There are two major scenarios where this can be great, beyond the obvious ""I need a backrow popped so lemme go into sliprider rq"".Â  The first doesn't really pop up in this deck since Strawman was dropped, but if you summon Dark Destroyer, pop itself, and go into Strawman which then revives Dark Destroyer. It's not a super crazy combo, but its free attack and free advantage, so if you're running Strawman keep that one in mind. The other one is much, much stronger. Say you're going second and open Raigeki, Kozmotown, Goodwitch, Forerunner, and Dark Destroyer. A pretty decent hand right? Your first reaction might be to play Town and gamble on recycling Forerunner into Farmgirl, but thats actually completely unnecessary, as if your Raigeki goes off you have a clear path to game. What you would do in this situation is start with Goodwitch and attack as usual, then go into Dark Destroyer as usual, but pop itself and then go into Farmgirl. From there you do the typical ladder combo. As long as you have a level 4, Dark Destroyer, and either a big ship or Dark Lady in your opening hand you can do the full combo. 3000 atk is usually enough to get the job done over most stuff, but if it isnt then thats why we have our xyz's. Endgame often results in multiple of these on the board, which is why the only xyz's I specifically looked for and that arent just ed filler are rank 8's. Zombiestein get you over basically everything with its 4500 atk and Teardrop's effect circumvents ""Cant be destroyed"" effects, but these cards also lose Destroyer's protection effect and you also lose Destroyer's banish effect so don't just go into those willy nilly. Overall this is your Big Boss monster, its incredibly easy to put out on the field, and its incredible effects make it incredibly versatile. If you're not running this at 3 its either because this got semi-limited again or because you're throwing.  Destroyer tl,dr: Your endgoal. Increidbly versatile untargetable beatstick that goes into basically anything else on death. Should prolly read this one imo.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Eclipse"">Kozmo Dark Eclipse</a> x1:</strong> Dark Eclipse is a level 9 3000/2600 that is untargetable by opponents card effects, and during either players turn you can banish 1 Kozmo monster from your graveyard to negate and destroy a trap card activation. This has a unique banish effect, where when its destroyed you can add a lower leveled Kozmo to your hand instead of special summoning it like the other ships. Ok so first off, its active effect sounds good! It isn't. You will very rarely have a Kozmo sitting in your graveyard since their effects are all activated by banishing themselves, and passing up opportunities to keep the tempo up just to have fodder for this generally isn't worth it. Its harder to get on the field than basically anything else in the deck, only having the no tribs as its entryway. Its banish effect is also pretty bad compared to everything else, since I don't have to tell you why just adding to hand is worse than special summoning here. Obviously being able to turn this into a free Dark Destroyer might be a bit much, but as is its not very good. Maybe they could have made it search upwards instead of downwards so you could have got a free Dark Planet off of it and that could have made Dark Planet not so awful, but I'm getting into hypotheticals when I should be sticking to the here and now. Anyways, if its active effect sucks, its banish effect sucks, and its comparatively hard to get on the field, whats even the point of this being in the deck? Well, for one its still a 3000 att untargetable beatstick that can be swapped into by any no trib in the deck, which is pretty darn good, if not already covered by multiple other cards in this deck. The other, more interesting case to be made for it is in its interaction with <a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a>. As you will recall, Tincans effect lets you pick 3 Kozmo cards with different names from you deck and your opponent randomly chooses one of those for you to add to your hand, with the others getting discarded. Generally you will want to try and use this effect to bring out one of your untargetable boss monsters, but without Eclipse you only have 2 of those, making it a 33% chance you get stuck with Sliprider or Dark Lady or Kozmotown or whatever you chose as your third. Add on top the risk of just getting Ashed and you're not looking at a super incredible success rate. However, WITH Eclipse in the deck you have an 100% success rate in being given a boss monster, which is huge for consistency's sake. Even better for Eclipse, you will recall that these non-picked cards are sent to the graveyard, fixing its problem of very rarely having fodder with which to use for its effect. This effect moves those other boss monsters from the generally inaccessible graveyard to the much more easy to retrieve banish zone, making this a win win win situation. Overall, obviously I do have my issues with Eclipse, but its interaction with Tincan and its board presence make it worth running at 1 just for the added consistency it brings there. If you're fine nerfing Tincan pretty harshly you can swap this out for something else.  Eclipse tl,dr: Good off of tincan and an untargetable beatstick, not much else going for it  <strong>Spells</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> x1: </strong>Raigeki is aÂ normal spell that destroys all monsters your opponent controls. Non targeting monster removal is always good and making a clear front row for Farmgirl to start comboing off of is always good. Overall this is a generic staple for a reason, and it fits in well here.  <strong><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Feather Duster is aÂ normal spell that destroys all spell and traps that your opponent controls. Originally I had Monster Reborn here when I first made this deck, since its free and obviously great, but it was too reliant on whatever my opponent decided to dump in the graveyard and this deck didn't really have a ton of backrow removal back then so I decided to bite the bullet and craft a HFD. Destroying or forcing premature activations of spells and traps is always good, and being able to attack with a clear heart and mind is reason enough for this to be in the deck. Overall another generic staple that helped patch up a bit of a weak spot with this deck.  <strong>Lightning Storm x1:Â </strong>This card lets you destroy all attack position monsters your opponent controls or all trap and spells your opponent controls, but only if you control no face up cards. This is basically Raigeki and Harpies in one. Obvs v v good.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmotown"">Kozmotown</a> x3:</strong> Kozmotown is a field spell that: once per turn lets you return one banished Kozmo monster to your hand at the cost of 100xlv life points, once per turn lets you shuffle any number of Kozmo monsters from your hand back into your deck and then draw that many cards, and when destroyed from the field by a card effect lets you search any Kozmo card from your deck and add to hand. Ok, for starters this is not a lifeblood card, this deck can play and win a duel without ever once seeing this card. It is, however, a really good card that makes the deck more consistent and mobile. Its first effect is going to be its most used one. Making it so that you don't have to rely on drawing new pilots or ships after you offed them in order to keep momentum going is a godsend. If turn 1 you draw a pilot, a ship, and this (not an uncommon scenario at all!) you could much more confidently transition into the ship on player phase instead of waiting until enemy phase because you can recycle the pilot instantly. Making it so banishments don't stick is so obviously and self explanatorily good that I'm not going to go into it, since the answer to ""Is it worth giving up less than 1000 lp to bring back whatever I want from banishment?"" is yes 99% of the time. The second effect isnt going to be used as much as the first, but its still very useful if you're trying to get to a specific non-searchable like Raigeki or if you already have your pilot out and are trying to find a better ship for your hand. If you have this on the field then a lot of the time anything beyond 2 pilots on the field + hand is going to be overkill since you can retrieve them for free, so anything beyond those is a free swap. Only draw pilots? Pick one and swap the rest. Only draw ships? Pick one and swap the rest. Only draw backrow? Set them and pray you live until you can swap LMAO. Another pretty self explanatory effect. The death effect is maybe the strongest, and is usually not known by other players on the ladder who will carelessly pop it often. You can get a free boss or a pilot of your choosing (refer to section 1 to get a good idea of the scenarios where each of those would be useful), or if you feel like you had a good thing going you can just pick up another Kozmotown. Like I said before, Kozmotown isnt a lifeblood card, so honestly I'm usually pretty happy when this effect is popped since it gets me a tailor picked card for the current situation. Overall, despite me emphasizing a few times that you can definitely win without getting this card in a game this is still a very strong card to have, and should always be run at 3. If you like its effect enough you can even throw in Terraforming and Metaverse, but I don't think thats necessary at all and I'd probably sooner run it at 2 than at 4 or 5.  Kozmotown tl,dr: Most of its effects are pretty straighforward and obvious, read the card  <strong><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> x2:</strong> Emergency Teleport (or E Tele as I've been calling it) is a quickplay spell card that special summons one level 3 or lower Psychic monster from your hand or deck and banishes it during this turn's end phase. This card is nuts, like actually insane. 95% of the time we get a level 3 or lower Psychic on the field it's going to be banished before the end of the turn anyways, so this is just a free either turn pilot to either shore up your defenses on enemy phase or lead to huge combos on player phase. The obvious play out of this card is Farmgirl on player phase into ladder combo, which is made much easier because you still have your normal summon for the turn which can then turn itself into a ship to blast a hole in the enemy front row, and from there just go to town. You can also go into Strawman, since returning smth from banishment for some juicy damage is always nice, but that can leave you a bit bare at the end of the turn. As for Tincan I do not know how that card interacts with this one, as I have not tried that combo. If you want to risk it be my guest, but I still think the other two options are better even if it does work because you wont be able to swap Tincan into a ship if you're going for its effect. The two things to be aware of with this card is that all the pilot effects are once per turn tied to the card name, so if you swap out one Farm Girl for a ship then you won't be able to do so with your other Farm Girl that you may have summoned with this, and also that with multiples of the same monster on the field it can become easy to lose track of which one you summoned with this card. Overall this card is insane and you should run as many copies of it as are legal in the current format.  E Tele tl,dr: Go into Farmgirl and go nuts  <strong><a data-name=""Pot Of Extravagance"">Pot Of Extravagance</a> x3 ADDED:Â </strong>Pot of Extravagance is a normal spell card that at the begining of your main phase 1, you can randomly banish 3 or 6 cards from your extra deck in order to draw 1 or 2 cards respectively, and you can't use any other draw effects the turn this card is used. This card wasn't in the original deck loadout because I was very SR broke, but I believe that was a mistake and that this should definitely be ran. As I play more against stronger meta decks this deck's comparatively weak card gain ability has been highlighted more and more, and this is the best Pot Of for this specific deck, as we don't really use our extra deck for much. Even though we don't really use our extra deck for summoning, this card does require us to prep our extra deck with a bit more care than we originally did, so if you decide that would be too expensive you can either a) drop DP for a different monster or backrow removing card, which has the unfortunate side effect of removing our 2nd best removal card, b) accept that this card will introduce randomness and more uncertainty to DP and keep running it, which has the unfortunate side effect of making rng more prevalent for this deck, or c) run this at 1, drop only one of Strawman/Bottomless Trap Hole, and be conservative with its effect, which has the unfortunate side effect of not really being worth the deck space imo. This works best when you're not scared that you'll turn DP into something not particularly great and are 0k with procing its 6 banish effect, which can be scary if you're only running 1 N'tss, so imo the best solution will be running the 3 N'tss, 3 Wind Pegasus, 3 DMK, and 2 FGD which will cost you a pretty penny. If you're reluctant to spend beyond the 1 N'tss just going for the 3 Wind Pegasus should usually be consistent enough in being able to remove some backrow off of DP, but Wind Peg is obviously worse than N'tss in most situations so that will have to be a decision you make for yourself. Adding the 2 extra Dragon Master Knight's shouldn't be hard at all, its only an R. Overall this card is basically a free +1, with its only side effect being that sometimes DP will be less consistent. With proper extra deck preperation even that side effect drops away, leaving only a free add.  PoE tl,dr: You're gonna have to pony up for a few more Wind Peg's and DMK's at the very least, but a free +1 is going to be worth that every time.  <strong>Traps</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> x2:Â </strong>Tor Trib is a normal trap card that destroys all monsters on the field when a monster is summoned. Non targeting monster destruction is always good, and the ships obviously weather this effect much better than most other monsters due to their banish effects. Wickedwitch can also tank this effect with her own, which is a nice little bit of synergy. Overall this is a nice little card that is working towards the goal of opening up holes for Farmgirl to take advantage of, and also just destroying opponents monsters is pretty good sometimes. I think it works well here at 2.  Tor Trib tl,dr: Pop this when you have ships and your opponent is building something or when you have no monsters or really whenever it seems like it'd be good.  <strong><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole x1"">x1 DROPPED</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Bottomless Trap Hole x1&quot;&gt;x1&lt;/a&gt;:"">:</a>Â </strong>Bottomless Trap Hole is a normal trap card that when your opponent summons a monster with 1500 or more atk can destroy and banish them. I'm running this because I can't run more than 3 DP's. 1500 atk is obviously an important milestone in terms of this deck, since below that Farmgirl can get over them and start the real comboing so this thing's activation requirement is pretty convenient for that. Banishing rather than sending to gy is also nice, since more stuff likes to play around in the gy vs the banish zone. Overall its a single targeting monster destroyer that operates around a significant milestone for the deck, but we do have 3 DP's which do basically the same thing with more potential utility and less restrictions, so if you think that those cover your bases enough feel free to drop this for smth else.  Bottomless tl,dr: Replaceable card that can drop a monster when its summoned  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmojo"">Kozmojo</a> x2:Â </strong>Kozmojo is a normal trap card that banishes one card your opponent controls or from the gy at the cost of destroying one of your Kozmo monsters. This is a really good card. Gives you flexibility on when you pop your ships and can smoke front row, back row, or gy which is very useful. The obvious synergy here is with your ships, since when those are destroyed you get the pick of the litter from your deck to replace it. This does not synergize with Wickedwitch, as the destruction is part of the activation requirement. Overall this is a very good, and gives you mobility in addition to removal. Can run this at 3 instead of 2, but I generally keep it at 2 since it doesn't play super nice with the pilots and those are the ones I would usually need the removal to facilitate.  Kozmojo tl,dr: Use this to give yourself mobility out of ships that have already cleared their activation effect, and as a bonus you get a free removal.  <strong><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> x3 DROPPED TO x2 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>DP is a normal trap card that lets you target and destroy one face up monster your opponent controls for the cost of sending a monster with higher attack from your extra deck to the gy. This can only be activated once a turn and you can't special summon from the extra deck until the end of your next turn after this effect resolves. This is the card we build our extra deck around. Outside of Raigeki this is your best monster removal option imo. It does target and it does require you to send a monster with higher atk to the graveyard so you're not getting over a fully decked out Accesscode Talker or anything, but it works on monsters that are already on the board unlike BTH, doesn't require you to sac anything from your board unlike Kozmojo, and with N'tss as your cost you get an extra destruction on either front or back row unlike Destroyer. Overall I think this is one of your best turn 1 cards to get and even beyond that who can say no to free front and potentially back row removal? Definitely run at 3. If you're feeling skittish about untargetables or stuff that can get over this you can swap out one of the copies of this for <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, which will generally work better as a single removal and also has the use case of you just want a beatstick on your side of the field for free, but its a SR while this is only an R, and in addition I think the versatility of DP will often make it the better choice. Dropping one of these for IDP would also make it so that you can run 2 of all of your extra deck cards based off of this, which could save you dust in the long run and give you more room for niche usecase cards. It's up to you though as to what you value.  DP tl,dr: use N'tss with this for double the removal on anything 2500 and below, use Wind Peg on anything 2300 and below if your opponent only has the one card out, and above 2500 use Dragon Master/ FGD.  <strong><a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> x2 DROPPED: </strong>Fiendish Chain is a continuous trap card that targets 1 effect monster on the field to negate the effects of and make not able to attack, and if that card is destroyed then destroy this card as well. This card usually just feels like a bad Effect Veiler, but Effect Veiler is a UR and this very much isn't so I have to deal with it. Negating effects is good, and preventing attacks as a bonus is even better, but this card is pretty slow and usually the cards that it's negating don't wind up destroyed, which means that you'll have to play the rest of the game down a backrow slot unless you waste an N'tss or Sliprider on it which usually isn't worth it. Overall I sound very down on this card, but still the truth is its a good card that I always use when I get it.  Chain tl,dr: You should prolly swap this out for other similar cards if you can, but its still pretty good itself and self explanatory in terms of usage.  <strong><a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> x2 ADDED: </strong>Lost Wind is a normal trap card that allows you to target one special summoned monster on the field to negate its effects and halve its original attack, and then if its in the graveyard when a monster is special summoned from your opponents extra deck you can set it again at the cost of it banishing itself when it leaves the field. This card was added to take over the slot that was previously occupied by Fiendish Chain, andÂ  will generally fill the same role as that as a problem monster checker. Almost anything that can give this deck trouble as a monster is going to be special summoned, so its activation requirement is basically a non factor, but not being able to stop your opponent's normal summoned combo starters is rough. There are pros and cons for both halving a monster's original attack vs making them unable to attack, where halving things attack will usually make it so that you can easily get over all but the biggest walls, but the monster still being able to attack at all can be an issue if they're swinging for game, and it only halving original attack means that things like Accesscode Talker and Apollousa aren't going to be affected by this part of the effect, but Accesscode was also a problem for Fiendish Chain since it could out it on reaction with its effect while Appolousa is generally easy enough to get over for this deck. The big sell for this card is it's revival effect when something is special summoned from the extra deck, which is self explanatorily good. Overall this is a very strong card that will almost always be used whenever it finds its way into your hand, and sometimes twice.  Lost Wind tl,dr: Use this to stop problematic monster effects and bring the biggest of bads down a bit in size.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> x3:Â </strong>N'tss is a level 4 2500/1200 fusion monster whose materials are 1 synchro+ 1 xyz that must be special summoned from the extra deck by banishing the above materials. Its effect is Once per turn: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 monster from your hand, If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it, you can only Special Summon ""Elder Entity N'tss(s)"" once per turn. We will never, ever summon this card. That doesn't stop this from being a very important part of the deck to the point that I caved in and crafted this UR. Comboing this off of DP takes it from a single target monster remover to a monster + another monster or backrow remover, which is huge especially since DP is something you will be using most games at least once. This is one of our few backrow removers as well which helps it. Overall this card takes DP from a good to a great card all without taking up a single maindeck slot, which is reason enough for it to be here. I actually ran this at only 1 and thats worked out fine so you could do so too, but I think the potential to use it 3 times is very very strong, especially if you go with 3 PoE's.  N'tss tl,dr: Use this to add a second removal to DP  <strong><a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>Wind Peg is a 2300/who cares level 7 synchro that when one of your cards is destroyed by battle or opponent card effect you can banish this from the field or grave to shuffle one card on their field into their deck. 999/1000 times you are only going to use these effects, and only use it off of DP, BUT Ash is technically a tuner, so if you're really being oppressed by an opponents spell/trap you can synchro summon this and then proc it's effect of ""During your Main Phase: You can destroy Spells/Traps your opponent controls, up to the number of ""@Ignister"" monsters you control."" to clear that. Is that the best possible use of Ash? Usually not, but if it could win you the game then its a play you should be aware of the possibility of. Overall this is a cheaper, worse version of N'tss that is worth the 3 extra deck slots if you're going for the PoE's.  Wind Peg tl,dr: Use this to add a delayed second removal to DP that is only an SR, and also possibly synchro summon if you're really in a pickle.  <strong><a data-name=""Five Headed Dragon"">Five-Headed Dragon</a> x2:Â </strong>FGD is a 5000/who cares that must be fusion summoned. This is a UR but you get 2 of them for free from the Dragon Starter which is why its here, if you don't have that one replace it with Dragon Master Knight which is an R and does the same thing. This is here because it's the strongest extra deck monster and it can't be special summoned from the grave, meaning your opponent cant get cheeky with it after you pop it with DP.  FGD tl,dr: Pop this with DP if you're not popping N'tss  <strong><a data-name=""Dragon Master Knight"">Dragon Master Knight</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3 DROPPED TO x2 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>DMK is a 5000/who cares that must be fusion summoned. This is here because it's the strongest extra deck monster and it can't be special summoned from the grave, meaning your opponent cant get cheeky with it after you pop it with DP. It's only an R, really nothing else is a better use of the extra deck space and making sure that even after PoE you're almost guaranteed to have at least 1 uberbeatstick to proc DP off of so it should be at 3.  DMK tl,dr: Pop this with DP if you're not popping N'tss  <strong><a data-name=""Number 22: Zombiestein"">Number 22: Zombiestein</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Zombieman is a 4500/1000 rank 8 xyz that needs 2 level 8 dark's to summon that can negate effects of monsters for 1 turn at the cost of 1 material, 1 discard, and changing this to defense position. This should be used to get over uberbeatsticks with immunity to being popped such as Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon. This obviously seems pretty tricky to get out while theres something like that out, but with E Tele and some luck anything is possible. I only stuck this in cuz I pulled it randomly, but its decent enough at its job that Imma mention it by name here. Feel free to replace with whatever you think would work best at getting over uberbeatsticks here.  Zombieman tl,dr: Use this to get over the biggest of the big  <strong><a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Teardrop is a 2800/2800 rank 8 xyz that requires 2 level 8's to summon that you can detach 1 material from and then target 1 monster on the field to tribute. It also gets 200 atk until the end of the turn for every tributed card. This thing's usecase is to deal with very annoying can't be destroyed by effects that are a bit too big atk wise to go over with Destroyer like the Eldlich's. Once again I only stuck this in cuz I pulled it randomly, but its decent enough at its job that Imma mention it by name here. Feel free to replace with whatever you think would work best at getting over those annoying things here.  Teardrop tl,dr: Use this to get rid of the sticky week old gum that just wont go away.  <strong><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> ADDED x1 DROPPED: </strong>Zeus is a 3000/3000 rank 12 XYZ that can special summon itself on top of an XYZ that has attacked this turn, and has the quick effect to detach 2 materials and send everything else on the field to the graveyard and the effect to add a material to itself from hand/deck/gy if another card of yours is destroyed via battle and card effect. Given that our XYZ's are situational last resorts that are only ever used if things have really hit the fan, this card follows to be even more niche. I only added this because I needed it for another one of my decks, so don't go out crafting this just for this deck it's not worth it. With those being said, holy crap is this card nuts. Non targeting, non destruction OMNI-REMOVAL as a quick effect is something I would have made up as a kid when I'm trying to bs my brother with my random japanese card, and even then there's no way he'd buy that its just too strong. It's attack is good enough to act as a replacement for one Dragon Master Knight, and as a monster that we can actually get out it's automatically more impactful than that, and thats before considering that this card is insane strong once you do get it out. Overall this card is nuts, even if it wont be super common to get it out. Optional but should def be added if you have it.  Zeus tl,dr: Were you pushed into a corner and have to use your XYZ's? Well your opponent is in the corner now staring down a 3k beatstick with no field.  &nbsp;  <strong>Everything else in the extra deck:Â </strong>I just put in there as filler. Feel free to use whatever you have that you think would work best to cover situations this deck could be weak in. This deck generally doesnt use the extra deck much so it doesn't matter how niche it's usecase would be, as long as you think it could be helpful."

Having 3 Servant of Endymion helps so much with the consistency of the deck and Electrumite is just as powerful as we I remembered. Depending on the situation, I'll either go for Crowley or Electrumite. As you can see, I am running a 2-2-2 ratio for the Spellbook engine. I really like the possibility to always be able to go into Crowley and have its effect trigger even after Pot of Desires-ing.  I am considering to cut Abductor to 2 and remove Bashilisk completly, since Bashilisk doesn't do much more than putting 2 counters on Institution and drawing a card. Abductor is less important at 3 since we now have Servant at 3.

Also, this is pretty much half a deck list discussion and guide, and half a rant about most people onl","&nbsp;  Hey, how are you doin'? My name's Grayewick. I'm doing fine as well, thank you. I'm in a pretty good mood right now, since I've been having a great time in Platinum ranks nowadays in Master Duel, and the reason for that being is this deck, which so happened to also be my favorite deck and my deck in real life, Invoked Shaddolls.  Yes, I know, Normal Summon <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>, activate effect to add <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, make <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, set up for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> on your opponent's turn, pass. It seems boring, right? Wrong. <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> and an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> is pretty much game against most combo decks, and they would need specifically <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to out it.  Aight, deck list.  <strong>""Why the fuck are you main boarding triple <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>?""</strong>  <span>Let me ask you something. What would you rather have going second, the virgin <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, or the chad <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>? I'm telling you, as soon as I got a hold of this game, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> was the first card I looked for and I'm glad that it's just an SR. Here's the reasoning. First of all, if you're really dedicated on building an Invoked strategy to its maximum potential, you need as much coverage as you can possibly get, that's why you see older Invoked lists running as many powerful hand traps that are either floodgates (like <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> or <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>) or those that can also act as bodies on board (like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, or <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>, the latter still unavailable in Master Duel as of now), or those that provide different attributes as well for your Fusion summons, and also if you've seen my past guides, this is one of the answers as to why I have been splashing Invoked in every archetype that does not really need a Normal Summon, but can be mutually beneficial as well. Take a look at my Invoked Lyrilusc and Invoked Salamangreat list, if you still haven't. I have tested this deck so many goddamn times, it's not even funny, I've seen and heard lot of people recommend newer players to Master Duel to buy certain blow out staples like Lightning Storm, for example, and I am here to tell you that Lightning Storm is way weaker than Evenly Matched for and against Invoked Shaddolls for the one simple reason of having Trap coverage. I couldn't count how many people I've seen running only one <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> and one <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> in their Invoked Shaddoll list with their reasoning only being ""if you need to run 3 copies of <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> or more than two Resh then you suck at managing your resources bro"", only to lose post siding to a blinding second strategy with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, it's painful. If you don't have <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> yet, but have already gotten your <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s, that will do for now but I really do suggest playing <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> over it in this format because Eldlich is one of the stronger top tier decks in Master Duel as of today, and with <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> you instantly lose against <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> and even if you do manage to clear their entire back row with <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, their graveyard is already set up for next play, thanks to you destroying them and on that case, the best case scenario left for you would be finding a way to dump <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> to the graveyard to hopefully clear all them Golden Land and Eldlixir traps, which arguably takes more significant effort AND resources than just banishing them face down with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and being patient with your plays. Having either <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in your deck than Lightning Storm just increases your success and coverage significantly in mirror matches.</span>  <strong>""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a>?""</strong>  <span>Yes, THE <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a>. There will be occasions where you will find yourself not being able to continue your resource loop with your <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a> enough, most likely due to interruptions, and this is where <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a> comes to the rescue. Also we're not playing <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> in this list either because we're playing <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> instead but either's fine. Most would say that it's an optional pick in this build but I disagree, both in Invoked and Pure Shaddoll builds. You could always make use of an extra ""Shaddoll"" name, might as well use someone that helps you do the thing you're best at, and that is grinding the hell out of your opponent's resources.</span>  <strong>""Invoked Raidjin?""</strong>  <span>Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades are famous for their first turn <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> set up after gaining access to <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a>, and that's where <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> comes in crucially. As soon as two <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Recital Starling"">Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</a>s hits the board, just book the one without <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow"">Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow</a> as material with his effect. Since this is a best of one game, you really don't have any way to figure out whether your opponent is playing Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade let's be honest, but then if the time comes where you need that sort of interaction, it does not necessarily mean that it had to be exactly that scenario in particular, it could also be done at the middle of your opponent stacking Zoodiac monsters for <a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a> or when your opponent summons <a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> for <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>, it's there. You don't always need destruction effects to interrupt your opponent.</span>  I could talk all day about how many possible interactions and play lines you could choose to do with this deck against the current meta match ups, but I honestly do not have enough time for that, it would be great and I'd love to do it, but I do not have the means yet but I digress. If there's one thing you might consider changing in this deck is substituting one of your other <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Constructs"">El Shaddoll Constructs</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> for a copy of <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> for attribute coverage for the purposes of your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> since Eldlich runs <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> which is an EARTH monster, and match up coverage for them weird attributes that some rogue decks like EARTH Machines have.

This summon requires both 1 Mirror Force (trap card) and 1 The Fang of Critias (spell card). To search for these cards, you may use Gold Sarcophagus and Different Dimension Capsule.  While waiting for your main fusion, you can still play for some high ATK with the red-eyes portion of the deck. Three Red-Eyes Fusion spell cards can be used to fusion summon Red-Eyes Slash Dragon, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Meteor Black Comet Dragon. (OPTIONAL: You can replace one of these fusions, alongside with their respective fusion material from the main deck, with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and a Dark Magician. Me and my friends banned this monster from our table, so I've built the deck without it).  If you drew really bad, you can still link summon Predaplant Anaconda, pay 2000 LP and activate red-eyes fusion from your deck.  There are a few other Red-Eyes cards that can help you stack your field with high level monsters, setting you up for some XYZ summons. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon allows you to summon your black dragons from the GY, while burning your opponent's LPs. Dark Armed can be summoned with just one dark dragon monster and destroy opponent cards. Number 11 takes control of your opponent's monster and Number 76 is immune to monsters with the same attribute as her. She can recycle her materials to give her additional attributes.  The rest of the deck is filled with support cards, and you can replace them at your convenience."

Mass Swarm field on turn 1 or 2 with full board (if you feel safe *have 1 or 2 ways to recover Borrelsword from GY if opponent Board Wipes or stop at 4 summons) of Fur Hire in this order of importance. <ol>  	<li>Beat</li>  	<li>Seal</li>  	<li>Recon</li>  	<li>Filo</li>  	<li>Donpa</li>  	<li>Helmer</li>  	<li>Bravo</li> </ol> When you get to 4 Fur Hires SS I:P Masquerena using 2 Fur Hires then SS Borrelsword Dragon onto board using I:P Masquerena and 1 more Fur Hire and Win game most of the time. It's very hard for opponent to deal with 1 or 2 Borrelswords that dont get destroyed by effects or battle. Hence, Immortal FurHire!  We dont counter Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler there's ways to do that but it's not worth putting in deck to counter Ash Blossom or Veiler. Less consistent if we add cards to counter it.  Added 3 copies of I:P Masquerena so you can protect all 3 copies of your Borrelsword Dragon (You need that for clever opponents) from Effects so it won't be destroyed by both Card Effects and Battle. Masquerena also allows you to point a link so you can use World Legacy Succession to SS Borrelsword from GY in case it does get wiped somehow. Added protection.  Added 3 copies of Maxx 'C' because every deck in rank is SS turn 1 or 2. This draws you lots of cards if its in your opening hand.  Updated - Now has a ton more GY recursion + More Summons up to 26 for consistency. There's too much control decks floating around with tons of Board Wipes you need to be able to recover your Borrelsword from GY if this happens or you loose 4 summons.  100% Consistent. That's the idea of the wins you'll get. Ez GG's. Since every card in your deck SS to board +1 plus GY recursion."

Your standard turn 1 play is to either negate all the Extra Deck with Zoroa or sit on a Vahram and Rilliona in DEF. Anything else is just extra.  If you can't go into the Extra Deck, use the charmers to augment ATK without slowing you down since being level 4 Spellcasters is what Magistus thrive off.  I only run 3 charmers in the main deck because I have access to all of their ED variants thanks to Crowley. The only one missing is Dharc, which will be replacing Aussa in the Extra Deck and Aussa will be take up a Sphere Mode slot. You only want 2 charmers in the ED because on average your opponent will run either Light or Dark Boss monsters. Once they are in the GY, you are free to take them for your own.  In all fairness, I only play Accesscode Talker because there's no way for this deck to get over Monsters with 4000 ATK and protections without struggling"

Chaos-Monarchs are basically playing the Monarchs you know and love, but with the serenity of a Chaos package that doesn't just work in Thunder Dragons. With the ease of the Light and Dark Squires, Erebus, Zaborg, and Ehther can deploy all kinds of tomfuckery in the OTK department: from popping itself to take a cheeky peeky into your opponents Extra deck; to ruining your opponents Protos *(they didn't use their Maxx-C on)* by shuffling it back to the deck (at a 1 of 5+ chance); to even special summoning another Monarch to use for OTK or later for the usually tranquility and Torment. Before I forget, the chaos package I will be using is the usual copy of Collapserpent and Wyverburster, alongside The Chaos Creator, Chaos Space, and Chaos Daedalus *(A monster that protects light and dark monsters from effects; and banishes up to two cards for every field spell on either players side of the field).* Anchamoufrite is also a widely used staple in Monarchs that could be recycled with Chaos Space to be used again later on. As for the side Deck, I insisted on just a default side deck because of a lack of data for what a side deck for any competitive Monarch builds could look like in this day of age.</p>"

But this deck has a lot of different effects to remember and like many archetypes in the game it doesn't have much to go on, either you play that way or don't even try to use this deck. My goal is to demonstrate that you can use this deck in different ways and take advantage of the different effects of the cards to make the best choices and even surprise your opponent who most likely underestimates @Ignister and the different play lines possible to do as I present next.  Comments on cards and interactions important to remember: (detail: I call <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a> = Fire, <a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = Light, <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> = Dark, <a data-name=""Bururu"">Bururu</a> = Wind, <a data-name=""Doshin"">Doshin</a> = Earth, <a data-name=""Hiyari"">Hiyari</a> = Water, <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> = Towers, <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> is a way of saying I'm using the Dark Templar effect, <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a> = Field)  Fire you can do in the Damage Step and that way you don't take battle damage. It synergizes you with @Ignister's LINK-3 Fire that you should know because there are strange situations that you can use this to your advantage to destroy your LINK-3 and it triggers eff to destroy an opponent's monster (only if destroyed by card effect and not by battle) not to mention that it will return to the field in the next Standby Phase after being destroyed (here this effect activates even if it is destroyed by battle). That way you can catch someone unaware and take out cards like <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> from field easily.  Using Water @Ignister allows you to play after taking <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> for accessing <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a>. Going second these cards help to kill the opponent with <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a>. But as it is not searchable by <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> for me it is best not to use it. Using Water usually gives you access to <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> when Tributing <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> and he enters the field to go straight and make the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and leave him Unaffected.  The good thing about <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> is that you force <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> early because when you do <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> he is forced to chain Nibiru to Gatchiri, but this same play can be done with <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and you don't lose your <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> so soon keeping it in Extra Deck. Even because the push you make will be to go to the 3k atk Towers after that would be the result of the combo playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> and leaving Dark Templar in the Extra Deck.  Earth @Ignister is searchable and helps Accesscode and play after opponent disruptions.  You can use <a data-name=""Cynet Mine"">Cynet Mine</a> to send <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a> to the GY and that way you play around in <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> interaction. <a data-name=""A. I. Contact"">A. I. Contact</a> can be added back to the hand with <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> so you always draw three cards every turn in the Grind Game demonstrating the importance of having this card available.  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> is for playing after taking <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> but I think <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> is much more important in the extra deck than this card. This spot could be the third Dark Infant and Update Jammer spot. A curiosity is that <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> is an excellent out of <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a> because you negate his effects during the Damage Step and with that you can take him out in battle.  The second <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> is essential in the grind game being indispensable and much more important to have 2 of it in the Extra Deck than 2 <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a>.  Going second you can with the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> after destroying the opponent's monster give <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> in Damage Step and Main Phase 2 go straight to TOWERS playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>Â if the opponent doesn't notice this move in Main Phase 1 or if you can do it the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> being your 4th summon which is not impossible in a simplified gamestate. To play around <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> with Dark Templar you can simply <strong>threaten Battle Phase</strong> and that way it already forces you to use it if you don't guarantee to do <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> on M2.  Xyz <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> allows you to add Light @Ignister to the hand with ROTA. It also helps break field and OTK.  <a data-name=""A. I. dle Reborn"">A. I. dle Reborn</a> effect of adding Spells/Traps in Grind Game is very important to remember because it is the difference between winning and losing. <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> works the same way as <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> to make <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> combo so if you can add and resolve the <a data-name=""A. I. ââContact"">A. I. ââContact</a> then do that instead of adding A. I. Meet You which is not needed as you already have A. I. Reborn that makes the combo happen anyway.  Techoplay: <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> can be used from the field to Bounce opponent's cards after something of yours is destroyed. Another thing to know is that if it triggers an effect when your monster is destroyed by battle, this effect will be <strong>activated during the Damage Step</strong> which avoids being negated by several cards in the game because in the Damage Step you can only activate cards that negate activation of effects and not the effect of the card so <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a> for example cannot be used but <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> can be used by negating Activation of effects. <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> with the use of more than one <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> spell allows you to loop him back in backrow matches and destroy cards every turn. Even under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> you can Reborn him and use the effect and cl2 use <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to Tribute him and get back on the field and that way you can destroy the backrow. <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> banning itself also destroys <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. This move is also a good one to make if you want to play around <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a>.  <a data-name=""TA. I. Strike"">TA. I. Strike</a> is a way to take out annoying floodgates from the field with your main deck monsters like <a data-name=""Inspector Boarder"">Inspector Boarder</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> is another way for you to take <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> out of the field because when the opponent declares an ATK you can simply negate the ATK and on your turn with her 2300atk take her out in the Battle Phase. This is relevant to the point that you have to realize that in situations of passing with <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> you bring Dark and use Dark eff to add <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> to the hand just to be able to negate an Atk and it enters the field helping you to survive and take tough monsters on the way back.  Synchro 7 <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum"">Cyberse Quantum</a> allows you to have more chances for TOWERS to survive by passing it from the end board instead of doing Wind Pegasus.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Differences between each Starter is basically in the first half of the combo which I say is how you arrive at the following gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You always end up arriving at this part of the combo and from then on it will be the same for everyone what to do next to get to TOWERS.  Place the URL continuation on the duelingbook site after .com/  /////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 1: Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You/Cynet Mine 1 Card Combo (TOWERS 5k ATK - Not Recommended)  Example starting with Light from Starter: replay?id=621416-35837137 Gamestate: Towers (5k ATK) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus + <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 2: 1 Card Combo (Towers 4k ATK - Most Recommended)  If you do <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> first after <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> you can get <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> very early in the combo which is better in most cases than waiting for the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> effect to wear off to do Wind Pegasus. This is good for having the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> still in the Extra Deck for turn 3 to do OTK play.  Example starting with Fire from Starter: replay?id=621416-35878853 Gamestate: Towers (4k ATK) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus + <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 3: How to make TOWERS without going through the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a>? (Towers 3k ATK - SAFE ROUTE)  Example starting with <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> from Starter: replay?id=621416-35879497 Gamestate: Towers (3k ATK) + A. I. Reborn + Field /in Hand: Fire /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card) Opponent's Turn: A. I. Reborn summon Dark and eff Add Fire (Follow Up)  Advantages of this combo: If you take <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>/<a data-name=""Impermanence"">Impermanence</a> at this point in <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> you simply summon another extender and go to play <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and manage to end up with 4k ATK TOWERS the same way. If you take <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> it's good because you already have guaranteed Fire and <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> from Follow Up in your hand which means having guaranteed plays on the way back. This play line happens a lot to do Towers this way because even if your starting hand is 2 Fire + Earth you can do <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> knowing this <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> Route. And if you do <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> to add Wind you can still send Dark to recover Follow Up or Negate to have a better chance of Towers surviving. In summary this is the best move possible to make with the deck without using <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> to play around hand traps in the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> because it doesn't matter if Towers will be 3k ATK or 4k ATK and yes the important thing is to get to your win condition 1 turn and having defenses for Towers to survive and this is very relevant and brings you closer to victory than <strong>losing to an Impermanence/Veiler/Belle/Nibiru in the Dark Templar</strong> effect. I'm not kidding when I say that the number of times @Ignister players play Dark Templar and lose because yes since it's guaranteed that the opponent will stop him. It's <strong>much better to make sure Towers takes the field</strong> than to see you lose without even reaching your win condition, which is all the deck does. I have excellent results when choosing to play safe and make Towers with 3k ATK than waiting for the <strong>Dark Templar to take hand and pass with nothing expecting to lose</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 4: Wind + <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> (Towers 4k ATK)  replay?id=621416-35882425 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + Dark + A. I. Reborn + Field /in Hand: Fire /in GY: Wind Pegasus + 2 <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  Opponent's Turn: Reborn Wind and eff Foolish <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Negate) (When you leave Dark on the field with Reborn set you guarantee to return Reborn to the hand and it's very easy to do Xyz RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> on turn 3)  Interesting to analyze if it's worth starting with <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> in this situation where the monster you are going to bring in the <strong>Dark Templar arrow is Dark</strong> because in that case you <strong>would need to use two Dark Infant on turn 1</strong> to do the Arrival but in the case of doing the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> with <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> avoids wasting LINK-1 because you use Light to make TOWERS. But remember that doing the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> ROUTE means you can only do <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> when using Dark Templar's Soul Charge so it's a much more <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru </a>sensitive move than the first one. replay?id=621416-35882571 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + A. I. Reborn + Field /in GY: Wind Pegasus + 1 Dark Infant (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I.

Reborn</a> summon Dark and eff Add Fire (Follow Up)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo: Fire + Wind You don't need to do <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> so go straight to Splash Mage and after summoning Dark and add Fire you use <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> Reborn Light and go straight to <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and from then on it's like this: <strong>Wind eff send Fire</strong> and trigger Dark Templar summon Light and Fire and make Wind Pegasus and Reborn Light and make <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> with 4k atk. Playing this way you get the follow-up from both <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> and Fire and all thanks to having opened with <a data-name=""Bururu"">Bururu</a> but you pass without negate if you choose not to use Fire's summon with <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a>.  replay?id=621416-35885734 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + Field /in Hand: Fire + A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I.

So different from what everyone thinks about @Ignister you do <strong>have other boss monster turn 1 options other than Towers</strong>, being <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> which is basically an omni negate of monster effects and <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> which is a <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> on the field with mandatory effect that is not hard once per turn.  Combo 1: Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You/Cynet Mine 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> 2 negates + Hand Trap Level 4)  replay?id=621416-35837731 Gamestate: Darkfluid (<strong>2 monster negates and Unaffected until End Opponent's Turn</strong>) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You + Retaliating ""C"" /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card)  Combo 2: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> Turbo)  replay?id=621416-35838030 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> (2 monster negates) + <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> + Field /in Hand: A. I. Reborn /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card)  As you will see in the replays you can choose to have the <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> as an End Board Boss Monster which is a LINK-5 capable of <strong>negating the activation of the opponent's monsters effects</strong> and with the detail of not being once per turn. But his problem is that first you will only be able to do it with 2 negates because you will always have at most <strong>1 Synchro and 1 Xyz in the GY gaining 2 counters</strong>. Second it doesn't destroy the monster so it becomes a weak disruption to the investment needed to put it on the field. Third you will need to use <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> in the Extra Deck which is an <strong>excellent strong Xyz</strong> but this deck doesn't have much space in the Extra Deck for you to replace it with. The GOOD level 4 Hand Traps targets in the game are only 3: <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a>, <a data-name=""Retaliating &quot;C&quot;"">Retaliating ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> so using <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> seems to me an engine that depends a lot on the metacall inserted as for example some of these hand traps must be very good in format to consider using Darkfluid combo.  Combo 3: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> Double Raigeki)  replay?id=621416-35838685 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> + Field + <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> /in Hand: Nothing /in GY: <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> + Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card) (Remember that Bomber Dragon doesn't let you attack with other monsters on the turn it uses its Raigeki effect)  <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a>Â Combo is very good and your deck can practically do the same interaction as <strong>Double Raigeki's Prank-kids Battlebutler</strong> but you have much less resilience to interactions than Prank-kids losing to a lot of hand trap so I prefer not to use it in Master Duel but in a better game of 3 I would be using a copy of Bomber Dragon in the Side Deck just to switch in game 2 or 3 of the match <strong>if I am facing a Combo deck because Double Raigeki is excellent against this type of strategy</strong>.  Combo 4: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a>) replay?id=621416-35838890 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> + Field + (any BROKEN SPELL/TRAP in the GAME) /in Hand: <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> + 1 DRAW /in GY: Wind Pegasus  <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> is the replacement for LINK-3 Fire @Ignister which is used in the deck only because you need a 2300atk LINK Monster of Fire attribute to reveal with <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a>. Heatsoul is <strong>infinitely better option</strong> because it is a good card to give Summon since it basically has a Quick effect <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> every turn at a cost of 1000LP, so you draw 1 card on your turn, 1 card on your opponent's turn, and so on while they are on the field. I don't think this is the best <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> combo possible to do with the deck but as it doesn't exist in the TCG I didn't delve into how the deck abuses this card but for sure when it arrives in the TCG this deck will be better than it currently is .  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ***Board-breaking play: Field Special Fire and Fire eff Add Light NS Light and eff target Fire and become Level 4 RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> (in the Extra Monster Zone) and use eff to force Interactions and keep going after that.  ***Another cool situation to break field in Grind Game: <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> = Summon <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and in Battle Phase use eff to Reborn Towers In M2 you use Towers eff pop 1 Monster to make <strong>Token</strong> and do <strong>Accesscode Co-Linked with Transcode Talker</strong> to clear the rest of the field or force one more interation. And you can even do <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> using the Token to bounce a monster you don't want to send to the GY like the Tri-Brigade <a data-name=""Shuraig"">Shuraig</a>. replay?id=621416-35884691  ***In super common gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + Light/Dark = <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and eff Reborn Splash Mage Use Splash Mage and Wind Pegasus to make <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> and eff Bounce 1 monster and <a data-name=""Make Accesscode"">Make Accesscode</a> to clear the rest of the field.  Turn 3 against Backrow decks: In Main Phase 1 you use Towers eff destroy and summon Token and LINK-1 <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> with the Token and use Light or Dark eff to Add <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> from Deck or GY to hand and use Reborn to summon <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> from gy to use eff to Destroy Backrow. A point to think about is in the pos-side deck if it's worth doing <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> Turn 1 against trap match or leaving it in the Extra Deck and doing it turn 3 to force backrow. For example: Field + Light (Follow Up Turn 3) = replay?id=621416-35884979  //////////////////////////////////////////////// In the Grind Game that you were stopped by hand traps you can summon <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> and make <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> and <strong>chain blockÂ the Dark Infant</strong> with Doyon cl2 granting access to the Field. This is so good that if you open it with Fire + Light + <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> you already start with A. I. Meet You add <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> so that in case the combo doesn't pass you guarantee access to Field on turn 3. Having the <strong>field in circulation as soon as possible is very necessary</strong> so if you open with Light and <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a>/Fire start adding the Field and not Reborn Spell <strong>because if the Dark Infant doesn't solve you lose</strong>. Having <strong>two fields is also good for A. I. Contact</strong> to solve in the Grind Game.  Even if you open with all possible engine cards you use <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> because it's free to add any name to the hand and it also goes back to the hand with the <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> effect to be the second Follow Up on the turn.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Below is the decklist I currently use in Master Duel, disregard the Side Deck because it doesn't exist in Master Duel. All the tech cards I use are of <strong>Normal (N) and Rare (R) rarity</strong> because it is difficult to craft the <strong>Super Rare (SR) and Ultra Rare (UR)</strong> rarity cards at least at the beginning of the game or without spending money what I refuse to do it because I'm not going to give money to this company called Komoney. If I had enough SR and UR all my staples that I'm presenting in the deck profile <strong>would be hand traps because that's how @Ignister plays: fill the opponent with hand trap until he stops and the game comes back to you</strong>, in yugioh you don't you can say yes to card effects if not you lose easily and for sure using 15 to 18 tech cards is ideal in @Ignister."

Well see, the problem with Monarchs is that you don't exactly have a good turn one play, if you don't have access to either <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a> or <a data-name=""Erebus the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus the Underworld Monarch</a> to snipe your opponent's hand, <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a> to mess up your opponent's Extra Deck, or <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> to set up for the next turn, hopefully, and the problem with Eldlich is that it does not have a good turn two play, unless you've established tempo during your turn one set up, provided it doesn't get messed up by your opponent during their turn, which is highly unlikely that they won't, so I thought to myself ""maybe I should try splashing these two together, test it, and maybe find some incidental synergies between the two archetypes"", and so I did, and so I found! It turns out that both <a data-name=""The Prime Monarch"">The Prime Monarch</a>, <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land</a>, and <a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a> are all treated as Level 5 LIGHT monsters on the field, giving this deck access to a neat Rank 5 toolbox in the Extra Deck, or Rank 8s as follow up considering the fact that all Mega Monarchs are Level 8 monsters, and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> is a Level 3 Tuner, providing access to Level 8 Synchro plays as well. Also if you didn't know, you can Special Summon <a data-name=""Erebus the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus the Underworld Monarch</a> using your Eldlixirs, if you already have an <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> on board because apparently, he's a Zombie type monster. And so, here's the list breakdown.</span>  <strong>The one of Monarchs:</strong>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Granmarg the Mega Monarch"">Granmarg the Mega Monarch</a>/<a data-name=""Mobius the Mega Monarch"">Mobius the Mega Monarch</a></span> - You'll usually set them up with <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> against back row heavy decks, depending on whoever you needs the most or who's available.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is one of the greatest turn one set ups you could have, especially if you already have an <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> for the next turn, or an Eldlich setup ready. Not a lot of cards has effects that provide access to hand information, and that's what makes Thestalos important.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This card is the first half of your second strongest disruptions (not necessarily weaker), being able to stack a card on the field on top of the deck and recycle a card on either GY to the deck. Sure, it does target, but it does not destroy, and if that card so happened to be an Extra Deck monster, your opponent would have to do all the work to bring out that monster again, but they might not even get another shot in doing so.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Caius the Mega Monarch"">Caius the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is the other half of your second strongest disruption, the bane of DARK attribute monsters, and the reason as to why this is arguably stronger than Raiza, is because sure it does need to target a card, but it banishes the card and inflicts a 1000 damage to your opponent, and if it so happened to be a DARK monster, you get to banish all copies of that card from anywhere. Also, if you tributed a DARK monster for his summon, in which you have more than plenty of, optimally during your opponent's turn through <a data-name=""Escalation of the Monarchs"">Escalation of the Monarchs</a>, you get to target TWO cards instead. That's six DARK main deck monsters banished maximum. And guess what, DARK attribute is one of if not the most popular attribute in the game, alongside LIGHT.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is, what I would say, your strongest disruption relative to today's meta game in Master Duel for one simple reason, and that is he gets to mess up with your opponent's Extra Deck, and in this current format, we have a lot of meta decks that rely heavily on one of Extra Deck monsters. Sure, his effect requires you to have tributed a LIGHT monster in order for it to be activated, but you've got a lot of in-archetype LIGHT monsters, and guess what, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> is a LIGHT attribute monster, and so are your Golden Land Trap cards. And you do not have to pop Zaborg himself, if your opponent has a LIGHT monster that can be targeted and destroyed, and so happened to have a higher Level than Zaborg, you can destroy that monster instead, and again, much like in Caius' case, LIGHT attribute is one of the most popular attributes in the game, alongside DARK.</span>  <strong>""Why use Xyz monsters?""</strong>  <span>So, here's the thing. Eldlich is a resource manage focused archetype, and so are Monarchs. <a data-name=""Pantheism of the Monarchs"">Pantheism of the Monarchs</a> being at three significantly makes it faster than back when it had it at 1, and this is where we discuss mirror matches and tempo control. There is only one rule that resource focused control decks follow when it comes to facing each other, and that is ""it's not about who gets to win sooner, it's about who runs out of gas later"", and that's exactly what your Xyz monsters provide. Not only do they provide additional interruptions and bodies on board, but they also act as a way to slow down the pace of your deck while applying enough pressure by holding your Golden Land traps, your <a data-name=""The Prime Monarch"">The Prime Monarch</a>s, and your Monarch monsters themselves as Xyz materials. It's fine if you don't get to activate your Conquistadors and Huaqueros in your GY this turn, you've got an established board while being able to interrupt your opponent through other interactions, and when all else fails, this is why we play <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>. He is the failsafe of this deck. He gets to recover any of your banished resources while he's on the field once during your opponent's Standby Phases, and he gets to recycle himself and another card on either GY back to the deck. I'm almost tempted to run <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> in this deck, if not only for the fact that I have to use my Extra Deck.</span>  <strong>Discussing the other Extra Deck stuff:</strong>  â¢ <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> â <span>Great monster with a non-destruction form of interruption. Can get really out of hand easily.</span>  â¢ <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> â <span>Heâs just here because heâs a Level 8 Zombie Synchro you get for free. Heâs a decent beat stick that can attack under <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a>.</span>  â¢ <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> â <span>Iâve discussed this card already in my previous guides, thereâs a reason why heâs limited and will most likely gonna stay as such. He recycles your banished Monarch, Eldlixir, and Golden Land Spells/Traps, or even any monster banished by your opponent once during each of your opponentâs Standby Phases. He also can rip a card out of your opponentâs hand at Quick Effect speed.</span>  â¢ <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a> â <span>Now THIS needs a bit more explaining. I have known but never really looked into this card intensively, until now that Iâve been building decks in Master Duel and have been searching for good Xyz monsters, and I told myself âWhy run <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a>, a once per turn spot removal, not even at Quick Effect speed when you can just run this instead, considering the fact that he can protect your LIGHT monsters, and that includes <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, from targeting effects, and Eldlich himself already has an effect that protects him from being destroyed, which both lasts until the end of your opponentâs next turn?â Also, not to mention the fact that because youâre playing Monarchs, you get access to a neat Rank 8 engine, and that is why weâre running <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, which by the way, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a> can recycle from the graveyard, if opponent happens to out it.</span>  â¢ <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> â <span>This card, I just recently discovered and has actually made me update all of my Eldlich lists just to include it because heâs actually crazy good for Eldlich. Heâs a Rank 5 Xyz monster that only requires Zombies, which should be pretty easy for you to make, that can float upon being destroyed in general. Also, he can steal monsters on your opponentâs graveyard by just detaching 1 Xyz material. Iâd even say heâs a staple in every Extra Deck Eldlich build.</span>  â¢ <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a> â <span>Here is where the jank comes to play. Weâre running two Link 2 monsters, including <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, thatâs why I decided to go with <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> instead of <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, since he offers more protection. Avramaxâ effect states that he canât be targeted by card effects, and your opponent cannot target other monsters for attacks, except himself if heâs Link Summoned, which Masquerena enables. <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a>â effect also states that your opponent cannot target monsters for attacks, except itself. Now what do you get if you have two monsters that practically does the same thing? I donât know if youâre familiar with this interaction but itâs practically like having two face-up <a data-name=""Command Knight"">Command Knight</a>s or <a data-name=""Solar Flare Dragon"">Solar Flare Dragon</a>s on the field except they both taunt attacks, not diverting it away as the previously stated two does, and also, if you plan on using the Masquerena + Avramax package on a Synchro deck and you can Synchro Summon a Level 7 monster, there is a way to also do this but better, with <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>. Itâs absolutely janky and I love it.</span>  This deck is just wonderful. I am a Fusion strategy enjoyer, but I do appreciate decks like Monarchs in particular as well, due to its nature of it requires the pilot to pay close attention to their and their opponent's resources as well, and that's what I loved about most Fusion strategies too. But anyway, I know this isn't a cheap deck to build either, but if you happen to have the resources to build or test it, or even improve it, give it a shot. That's all."

Let's get on to it.  The original game plan, as per usual: Protect the floodgates.  <strong>The non-Tenyi cards:</strong>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> - This is not mandatory, but a fantastic option if you can afford it since it sets up your graveyard as well. You don't have to have this card early on, for the mean time, more copies of Tenyi monsters will do, or even <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> if you prioritized obtaining them first.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> - This is a great one of for your Synchro 7/8/<a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> set ups, or just general Wyrm link plays.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Ryu Okami"">Ryu Okami</a> - This card is a hidden gem among Rares. Had I realized earlier that this was a Wyrm, I would've used it sooner. This card kills the extra deck of combo decks. I actually wanna test this with Dogmatika as soon as I can afford the engine for a full extra deck murder build.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a>/<a data-name=""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"">Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing</a> - Great Wyrm Level 7/8 monsters, respectively. Helps you go second.</span>  <strong>Other non-Tenyi techs that might interest you:</strong>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Buster Dragon"">Buster Dragon</a> - This card is hilarious. If your opponent is not playing Kaijus and they're using a type centered archetype that aren't Dragons, they're gone. Just sit with this card in Defense Position behind your <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> and you're good.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> - This card is the reason why I've been debating on playing more copies of <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>. It's a once per turn Spell/Trap negate, and this deck can make use of more protection.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - This card is busted as fuck. Imagine being able to recycle all of your banished <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a> during your opponent's Standby Phases, while sitting on a <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> - You're playing three copies of <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, which are free to obtain. It's also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal.</span>  So there it is, my pure Tenyi build. I've had lots of fun playing this deck casually, sometimes it even makes me wish that I was back at rookie just to have fun climbing with it again. I hope you do find pleasure in playing it as well, if you happen to do so."

Are you tired of seeing these Lyrilusc/Zoodiac/Tri-Brigades in the ladder? Have you had enough of asking yourself ""what have I done wrong"" after seeing Earth Machines continue doing all these stuff after being Ashed? Do you feel vindicated by the current Master Duel meta game and in a desperate need of absolute form of retaliation so bad, calling it a ""war crime"" would be an understatement? Well my friend, I came here to you to provide you something that not only you might enjoy, but your opponent is guaranteed not to. We are erasing ""fun"" in our vocabularies nowadays, ladies and gentlemen because I am here to present you, Counter Fairy Eldlich.  If that sounds like the most disgusting name of a deck you've heard, then good, because that's what it intends to do. But before everything else, I wanna preface this with a caution that this is NOT a cheap deck list.  <strong>The first ""unfun"" part of the deck list:</strong>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> -</span> The Solemn brigade, emissaries of unfun are absolutely mandatory for this deck, regardless of your overall ratio. You could make room for a <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> or two if you like.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> -</span> Generic hand trap, but the real power move here is Normal Summon Ash, Synchro with Ash and Conquistador/Huaquero into <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>/<a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> -</span> Generic Rank 5 with Quick Play spot removal.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> -</span> Cowboy's bigger brother.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> -</span> Great Zombie-type Xyz monster that floats upon destruction and can steal monsters from your opponent's GY by detaching an Xyz material. You can also revive him with your <a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine</a>.</span>  â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Blader"">Crimson Blader</a> - <span>To lock your opponent down from Special Summoning high Level monsters upon destroying a monster by battle during their next turn. </span>  â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Scrap Dragon"">Scrap Dragon</a> - <span>Generic one for one spot removal. Can be used to turn off your <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> if not needed anymore.</span>  â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a> - <span>A funny card. Not necessary but nice to have. Decent beater, makes OTKs easy, and offers a bit of protection to your Conquistadors/Huaqueros from battle.</span>  â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Vylon Disigma"">Vylon Disigma</a> - <span>A classic Rank 4 monster that has two forms of removal, one is a targeting, non-destruction effect, and the other is a non-targeting destruction effect. Great with your Fairies.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Bountiful Artemis"">Bountiful Artemis</a> -</span> Not once per turn draw power. We also have <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> at three, btw.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x2 <a data-name=""Power Angel Valkyria"">Power Angel Valkyria</a> -</span> Your main searcher.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a> -</span> The main reason you're still alive after all that Solemn negations.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath"">Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath</a> -</span> A fantastic boss monster in this deck. It pierces for damage, it can Special Summon itself, it searches. Standard for Counter Fairies, for one more reason later.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Minerva, Scholar of the Sky"">Minerva, Scholar of the Sky</a> -</span> your secondary beat stick that can also be a conditional searcher.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Meltiel, Sage of the Sky"">Meltiel, Sage of the Sky</a> -</span> your secondary way to recover that can also be a conditional interruption.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">The Sanctum of Parshath</a> -</span> A mandatory three of card. This is your only way to recover your Solemn traps and Fairy monsters from the GY, and also provides additional protection to your Set Spell/Trap cards, but the most important thing is it turns on the other effects of your Fairy monsters because it also counts as ""<a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a>"". Protect it with your life, literally.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> -</span> Because we're running <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>, <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, and <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> in this build.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> -</span> Sleeper staple in this format. Great against boss monsters that cannot be targeted and/or destroyed on decks that only utilizes one monster type, or for just straight up stealing them.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Ultimate Providence"">Ultimate Providence</a> -</span> Another reason why we're running a lot of Spells despite also using <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, because pardon my language but fuck them <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> (even though not a lot of people are running them, surprisingly enough), <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>s, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, and <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>s.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Rebirth of Parshath"">Rebirth of Parshath</a> -</span> This is why we're running only one <a data-name=""Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath"">Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath</a>,Â <a data-name=""Celestial Knightlord Parshath"">Celestial Knightlord Parshath</a>, and <a data-name=""Avenging Airknight Parshath"">Avenging Airknight Parshath</a>. It's a free optional summon upon negation. There's literally no reason not to choose to summon one, unless your field is full.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> -</span> If I see you chaining this to <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, I swear to God I'm gonna break your fucking kneecaps. No seriously, fantastic Counter Trap.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Divine Punishment"">Divine Punishment</a> -</span> It's a conditional omni-negate Counter Trap that does not require a discard.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> -</span> For Eldlich mirrors and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s.</span>  <span><span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> -</span> Standard for decks built around making your opponent not have fun as much as possible. There's no better feeling than flipping this up to a Sky Striker player in a best of one format. (RIP btw KEKW)</span>  <span><span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> -</span> Because we're playing monki flip anyway, who cares about Special Summoning during your turn. The pot can be anything of your choice though.</span>  The second ""unfun"" part of the decklist is just Eldlich, and I think that's pretty understandable and everyone who plays Master Duel can agree to that.  So yeah. That's it. Have fun committing crimes against humanity on the ladder."

I'm pretty sure I have never smoked anything but it's something that's been bugging my mind for quite some time now, a deck that strangely enough is actually better when blinding second than going first, Invoked Salamangreat.  ""Why play this deck? What's wrong with you?""  Well you see, there are actually strategies in Yu-Gi-Oh that are perfect when it comes to smokescreening strategies, mostly being the best decks unsurprisingly enough, mainly because they all either are not Normal Summon reliant like Lyrilusc, Tri-Brigade, etc. or they provide other strategies the missing component, be it an easily splashable engine that's small but explosive enough and does not xeno-lock you from making plays and/or a Normal Summon engine that provides a one card combo (usually) to test the waters and snipe potential hand traps. If that sounds familiar with you, then that's exactly what Invoked is meant to do in this list.  ""So, what's this deck's game plan?""  It's no secret that people love wasting their <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>s, and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>s upon <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>'s Normal Summon, but that still does not answer the question ""why mash these two together up?"". The reasoning is simpler than you might be thinking, and that being <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> can be linked off to <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> or can be used as a discard fodder for <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, perfect for hands where you drew the <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> (in which you run three of for maximum tilter) and that's why we have two normal summons in this deck, the other one being <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>. There are actually some hands that are so good, that sending Aleister to the GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> can be an optimal play. Your main boss monster here is actually not Invoked Mechaba, since he's pretty useless going second, and just stands there going 1st since <a data-name=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a> locks you out of monster effects the turn its effect is activated, except for FIRE monsters, that's why he's actually the weakest link in this deck and would be much better off later in the mid game grind as a defensive tool while you're recycling resources with your Salamangreat monsters.  ""How do you end games with this?""  Four ways. Out-resource your opponent, <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> and/or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> beatdown, or <a data-name=""Invoked Augoiedes"">Invoked Augoeides</a> control. That's it.  One thing to note is that the only mandatory hand trap here is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, since your Salamangreats can recycle it easily. The other three can be a flex spot for anything, and the reason why I'm playing <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> is because I decided to use <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> instead of <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>, otherwise I would've used <a data-name=""Invoked Magellanica"">Invoked Magellanica</a> or <a data-name=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a> and two <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>s instead. So yeah, that's pretty much the deck. The only problem with this is that, it can be expensive especially if you haven't invested in either Salamangreat or Invoked yet, since you need four UR cards in here, three being the <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> and one being the Salamangreat Almiraj. We're not running <a data-name=""Salamangreat Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a> in this list because the extra deck is tight enough."

For climbing ranked I would recommend the Maxx C deck as many of the combo decks you will verse in latter will be heavy on summons and you get free draw fuel, the Nibiru version of the deck is also good against combo heavy decks but it is less consistent as drawing a nibiru and not activating is basically just a dead card in your hand (the nibiru twister aims to solve that by using twister to pop spell/trap and discard a dead card.) Most decks in latter will choose to go first if they have the option, so playing any of the decks besides the ""Sky Striker going first"" deck will be enough to get you to Plat and consistently win, though even when I was testing the deck in plat lobbies I still won the majority of my duels with the ""going first"" deck. (The deck builds I am referring are <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/3gk4ZLJ"">here</a>)  &nbsp;  Pot of desires is just a free plus 1 and even if it gets ashed or negated it is a free spell in the grave to start our engine (not to mention that if you get the effect off you get a gigantic draw 2 which is made even stronger because of how sky striker plays). metalfoes engine is a very strong cycle through the deck, activate foolish burial goods, dump metalfoes, activate metalfoes, now you get a free draw and a free spell in grave with neutral card advantage. Plus desires and foolish are good for bainting out hand traps (specifically ash blossom). lightning storm is a potential brick card so I don't run it. run space typhoon to pop your own field spell card and get a free special summon of Raye on field, now that you have ray on field you can normal summon an ash or effect veiler and go into your needle fiber, access code talker combo, or save your normal for something else. space typhoon also useful for popping opponents cards if they have something like a skill drain which literally kills the deck. you can also combo space typhoon to destroy the cynet field spell and recycle Kagari (which I don't have to explain to you why that is very strong.) I dont run cosmic because none of the combos mentioned above would be possible because the card banishes instead of destroys. twin twist is a good pick as you can pop 2 of opponent back row or pop 1 and then 1 of your own for the same combos mentioned earlier accept sometimes you don't have a card that you are willing to toss. There are even more crazy interactions the deck can do. The amount of free extenions you get by special summoning off of all the spells and holding your normal summon makes the deck very resilliant and able to recover from a bad start.  Infinite Impermanence is literally one of the strongest cards in the game. The deck is a going second deck, imperm is one of the strongest going second cards, and even if you go first imperm gets an even stronger effect.  &nbsp;"

It can also banish itself from yourÂ <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">GY</a>Â to send any other Phantom Knights card from your Deck to the GY, setting up your other plays.Â <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Ancient_Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>Â can grant any other DARK monster 800 extra ATK/DEF while it is on the field, and acts as the searcher for the other The Phantom Knights cards in the Deck when banished from the GY. Finally, and most importantly,Â <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Silent_Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>Â can Special Summon itself from your hand if you control another Phantom Knight, setting up your Xyz Summon, and can search any Phantom Knights Spell/Trap when banished.  In a dedicated Phantom Knights Deck, one of Break Sword's most terrifying effects is triggered when it is destroyed (most often by its own effect), whereupon it revives 2 The Phantom Knights from your GY and raises their Level by 1. While this does not allow you to go back into Break Sword, you can then follow up withÂ <a title=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Rebellion_Xyz_Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a>, a powerful monster for defeating your opponent in battle. More importantly, it detaches both its materials for its effect, allowing you to use Cloak or Boots to search and useÂ <a title=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights%27_Rank-Up-Magic_Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>, a uniqueÂ <a title=""Rank-Up"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Rank-Up"">Rank-Up</a>Â card that also attaches itself to the monster you Xyz Summon and can make any DARK Xyz Monster, but the monster you Summon it onto must have no materials. This means The Phantom Knights are the only deck with an easy way to Summon the terrifyingÂ <a title=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Requiem_Xyz_Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>, a monster that can permanently steal all the ATK of 1 of your opponent's monsters, and negate their monster effects while reviving Xyz Monsters. The Launch can also banish itself from your GY to give your DARK Xyz Monsters extra materials, so setting up and maintaining Dark Requiem is one of this Deck's core goals.  Another important part of this Deck is its wide variety of on-archetype Trap Cards. As mentioned, many are Pseudo-Trap Monsters, some Summoning in response to a direct attack, others at any time. Two of the most important areÂ <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Lost_Vambrace"">The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace</a>, which provides the only easy means of SummoningÂ <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Cursed_Javelin"">The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin</a>, andÂ <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Shade_Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>, which has proved exceedingly popular for its effect to be activated the turn it is Set if you have no Traps in your GY, suppling a free DARK Warrior to any field. Of the other Traps,Â <a title=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Fog_Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>Â can negate the effects of a targeted monster and stop it attacking, but it also prevents you attacking it,Â <a title=""Phantom Knights' Sword"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a>Â gives any monster 800 ATK as an Equip-like effect, and can destroy itself to protect the monster, whileÂ <a title=""Phantom Knights' Wing"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a>Â is a Normal Trap that gives a monster 500 ATK and prevents the monster being destroyed once that turn. All three share a self-banish from GY effect to revive any The Phantom Knight but banishing it when it leaves the field, encouraging you to Xyz Summon with it to pass the rulings (as cards on the field becoming materials for an Xyz monster are not considered leaving the field and when they are detached, they are only considered as beingÂ <b>sent</b>Â to the GY, notÂ <b>leaving the field</b>).  The archetype also works fairly well withÂ <a title=""Link Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Summon"">Link Summoning</a>. With access to powerful monsters likeÂ <a title=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Isolde,_Two_Tales_of_the_Noble_Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a>Â and theÂ <a title=""Borrel"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Borrel"">Borrel</a>Â series of Link-4s, Phantom Knights can set up future space for Xyz Summons with ease. With their ownÂ <a title=""Link Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Monster"">Link Monster</a>,Â <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Rusty_Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, able to the monsters to the GY and Set the Traps from Deck at the same time while destroying an extra card when a DARK Xyz Monster is Summoned, the Deck has some terrifying control and removal power, culminating in, as ever, Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon.  Finally, in competitive play, the archetype is viewed as being too small to form a stand-alone Deck, so is normally paired with another Deck, normally also one that focuses on Rank 3s and DARKs. BothÂ <a title=""Burning Abyss"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Abyss"">Burning Abyss</a>Â andÂ <a title=""Danger!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!"">Danger!</a>Â have shown strong synergy with this strategy in this way, and the so-called ""PK-Fire"" Deck was one of the main meta Decks in 2016.

This deck isn't half bad and I have a 50% win rate with it out of 12 games. I tweaked the deck a ton and this is the best version that I could make.  They recently-ish got Penguin Brave which is a strong synchro monster that can special summon from the deck and flip your face-down penguins face up to trigger their effects. Other than that, you just want to bounce a ton of cards, kaiju big monsters, and get in a trishula."

I am 100% free to play and have found that it is extremely versatile and fun. It can go 1st and set up a recursive board with a decent floodgate (El Shaddoll Winda) with some good interruptions (Machaba, Handtraps, Super Poly, Fusion Summoning on their turn, etc). Going 2nd if your handtraps are not enough to stop them from board building you have plenty of options to out their board while setting up your own. The decks biggest weakness is Eldlich and True Draco; usually because they don't care about Winda and they can usually floodgate you out of the game. Both match-ups are still winnable.Â  Overall the deck is an easier one to pick up for those who are newer to a modern format or are coming from something like Duel Links while still offering plenty of complexity and a good learning curve for those looking for something that isn't just 'Monkey Flip'. If you have any comments or suggestions I would love to read them.  &nbsp;  Card Explanations -  Invoked Package - Best normal summon in the game? If you can, get out Machaba first to protect the rest of your plays. Otherwise, the entire package is usually amazing Ash/negation bate. With such a tight extra deck Purgatrio might seem like an odd choice but it closes out games and clears boards in a deck that often has trouble doing both otherwise. Hence the reason for the Almiraj into Gardna combo. Machaba, importantly, can also be summoned in under 5 summons to avoidÂ <em>The Rock</em>.  Shaddolls: The ratio's can always be played around and tweaked with. I have settled with what you see now with much experimentation. You usually want some in your hand to get more fusion summons and a negate from Shekhinaga/Machaba. Worth noting that the Ariel and Dragon can both be used on the opponents turn to mess up your opponents plays. Incarnation in the grave also turns any of your Shaddoll's flip effects into quick effects. Getting Schism is often a priority because an El Shaddoll Winda and/or an Apkallone on your opponents turn will often either end their turn or severely hinder it.  &nbsp;  Hand Traps: Generally, run what you have and what you like. However, you need some lights for Construct and an Earth for Shekhinaga. The Ash for Purgatrio is also kind of funny.  &nbsp;  Spellbook of Knowledge: Pot of Desires is fine, but I like Knowledge. Feel free to try either. The other pots are probably not an option when you are too likely to banish something important. You can also replace them with Upstart Goblin's."

It's a pretty popular and simple strategy with two basic game plans, either overwhelm your opponent with simple card advantage through your constant Invoked plays per turn, or stun your opponent using the Mekk-Knight lock, which this deck can absolutely turbo out with no problem.  The Invoked engine does not need any further introduction, everybody knows it by now due to the countless times people have Normal Summoned <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> in this game since its release. What's great about this strategy is you can easily pivot from one strategy to another, depending on whichever engine your opponent decides to interrupt.
