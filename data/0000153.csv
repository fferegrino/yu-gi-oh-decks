There are two strategies to use here, and this deck is capable of OTK. You want to go second with this deck. Dimensional Shifter is there to disrupt your opponent on their first turn before you go. The main strategy is to have Golden Castle on the field to mill out cards to power up Gren Maju. Gizmek Orochi and Pot of Desires helps with this, as well as Eater of Millions. The Danger! cards are in the deck to increase your mill rate but to provide both level 8 monsters as well as quick strength to muscle down enemy monsters.  To OTK, you have to draw: Gren Maju, Eater of Millions, Gizmek Orochi, Golden Castle of Stromberg, Raigeki, and Danger! Thunderbird. <ol>  	<li>Play Raigeki to proc any negation cards your opponent might have and to clear the field on enemy monsters.</li>  	<li>Play Golden Castle, you want to use it to bring out Hexe Trude to destroy a backline.</li>  	<li>If you have Gren Maju, normal summon him and then use Eater of Millions to access cards you don't necessarily needs from the Extra Deck to increase the ATK of Gren. You can leave Starving Venom Fusion Dragon in the Extra deck in case you can't OTK and need to use Super Poly later. With 14 cards</li>  	<li>Use Danger! Thunderbird to discard itself to clear any final set spell/trap cards before attacking.</li>  	<li>If a monster was summoned as a reaction to you clearing the field, use Eater of Millions to remove it from play. At this point, Eater should have 2400/2500 ATK, Hexe Trude with 2600 ATK, and Gren Maju with at least 9600 ATK.</li> </ol> Sometimes you'll encounter an opponent with a high ATK monster that is immune to the effects of Hexe Trude and Eater of Millions. I've included Number 20: Lancelot and Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon to provide an option to finish an opponent off with Lancelot's direct attack or overpower a monster without targeting them by using Prim Photon Dragon's Xyz effect to buff itself."

","Okay so, yea, this deck is pretty degenerate. I regret nothing. It's a Myutant deck based around traps and floodgates, so I included a ton of various powerful floodgates and such. The core idea is to climb into the negation boss monster for constant negations, and set a ton of backrow, as to make sure the opponent can't advance. The deck has pretty good grind game in order to get several fusions and negations on field, as I included multiple negation monsters (Dragoon, Mechaba, etc). While normally, they couldn't be summoned, I included Cyberstein to turbo them out and layer on negations on the board. For the card list, I included the usual Myutant cards, as a fairly consistent way to get into the large negation monster and set up some of their traps for interruption, like the archetypal Pog Blade. To fill up space, as Myutants don't have a lot of cards, I included a large amount of stun cards. There's Inspector Boarder, which I can't even figure out, as a normal summon option along with Cyber-stein, and various popular floodgates, like There Can Only Be One, Gozen Match, Etc. The extra deck is mainly just a ton of Cyber-Stein targets, the regular Myutant cards for climbing into negates, and the Verte Anaconda for extra consistensy. So yea, this is just a run of the mill, degenerate control build. Pretty fun, consistent, and toxic. You're lucky I didn't include Mystic Mine."

Gemini Ablation summons Geminis from the deck with their effects. Carbo Crab is the main set up to get a Gemini in the graveyard and then one into your hand. Oxy Ox summons a monster from the hand and adjusts the level to allow for either Rank 2 or 8 XYZ such as Dingirsu, Cursed Javelin, Toadally Awesome, and Methydraco. First of the Dragons w/ Dragon Mirror helps get some minor protection. Titanocider &amp; Lost Wind I personally use to shut down extra deck monsters or at least slow them down. Burnout is a good way to set up your rank plays and Starving Venom I've never used but it does help get rid of pesky monsters when combined with Super Poly since Dark is pretty common. I also took the liberty of adding in a couple more Predaplants and Invoked Elesium. Plus, Super Poly fits with the chemistry theme.  Reduce, reuse, recycle! And like with any good chemistry experiment: blow things up! This was a fun deck to build and playtest. Enjoy!  PS, yes I like to run more than 40 cards :)"

I wanted to cut the deck back to a solid 40 card list filled with extenders and starters, and cut cards like Levianeer and Brotaur that are on the fringe, things you search out in specific hands and otherwise don't really start your combos. I also chose not to run Halqifibrax, saving us on putting in a tuner, since to make the Halq play you need to commit 2 extra monsters, at which point you might as well make the hard Apollousa anyways. Additionally, our basic combo requires pitching 3 cards (Dragon Ravine, Quadborrel, and Dragoon), so Plaguespreader doesn't appeal to me in Dragoon builds. 40 cards does mean we'll see out bricks more often, but we'll also see things like Chaos Space and Seyfert more often, so it pays off IMO.  The field spells and Dragoon packages are engine requirements. I chose to run 2 Red-Eyes Fusion so that seeing 1 copy in your hand just gives you a target to pitch, and doesn't deny you Dragoon. Absorouter is an engine requirement that also works as a good free extender in the Rokket deck. By now, this Rokket package is standard - it gives you good interaction and just enough bodies to play some grind game, but there's no reason to run Recharger anymore IMO.

A truly budget deck that (almost) copy from EDO bot's deck lol,"Final Version. This is the lowest prices DM that has highest hand consistency and come back capability. The side deck is quite expensive, though. But any less than this is not good enough to play lol.  !CAUTION!  If u use the effect of Dogmatika Maximus to send DM the Dragon Knight to GY, it cannot be revived by card effect. That because it is not fusion summoned properly, that mean it is not in the game by the rule! BUT! It can be use as fusion materials for Magicalized Fusion (Quintet Magician).  SO u must not use Maximus to send DM the DK to GY but use it on other cards instead. lol F--- the rules!  The goal of this deck is... if u had played with that DM bot in EDO before u will already know so no more explanation.  It is just that... I can build this deck entirely on TCG cards, that is.  Clara&amp;Rushka (or Link-1 Artemis) only purpose is to be link then get sent to GY for Maximus. You can reaplace Clara&amp;Rushka with Artemis. The reason why she is not in the main deck is because I'm poor.  I put Anaconda in side deck because that thing is by no means budget.  You may ask me: Why Mystic Mine?  The answer is: Why not?"

Main strategy is to open traps to control enemy and try to swing them huge damage with Raviel or Hamon. Try not to leave Chicken Game on field if you does not have lost paradise to replace it. Since skill drain only affect monsters on the field, your lv 1 and 5 monsters who tribute can still activate their effects. If you open There can be Only One, just use those summoning beast to special summon Hamon instead of Raviel. Use the cannon to clear off opponents remaining LP when necessary. The starlight road is to protect your magic and trap from feather duster, twin twister etc since all these cards can really make your whole board wiped in an instant. Sacred Beast Awakening act as a 2nd choice for skill drain (with better effects) which makes your deck have exactly 6 skill drain."

Not close to being competitive or anything. The main goal of this deck is to go first, get searches with XX-Saber Darksoul, hope you won't die on opponent's turn, get Faultroll loop going next turn and OTK your opponent. This needs 2 XX-Saber Faultrolls, 1 XX-Saber Ragigura. Plus usually some other X-Saber. Tri-Brigades help a lot to establish some kind of board presence for opponent's turn and to gain more card advanatage. I tried to make the deck be able to make Faultroll hand loop with gottoms but didn't succeed in making it consistent enough. It needs so much setting up and there are no fast and good ways to search Faultroll so I ended up just trying to make it more consistent and try only using Faultroll loop for link spam. </span>  Replays:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eXDz2bIdHA  &nbsp;"

Zoodiac known as twelve beasts is an archetype of earth beast-warrior monsters with level 4  One of the most popular archetypes in Yu-Gi-Oh!  Zoodiac has the extraordinary ability to make XYZ summon using one monster card  Anyways, let's just jump to the deck list  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  The greatest meteor that can destroy everything, very useful for dealing with decks that rely on complex combos like Virtual World, Dragon Link, Drytron and several other rogue deck  2x Artifact Lancea  Stop opponent banish card  2x Skull Meister  Love him more often, he deserves it. Why? Listen carefully. He can stop the activation of Eldlich trap card in graveyard  2x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion  Sometimes, quite useful for blocking enemy combo. So here 2 copy of her should be enough, since we have Skull Meister in deck  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  As usual the competitive deck has a hand trap to support its performance, and here comes 3 copy of Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  This level 1 spellcaster that looks like a beast is very useful in dealing with meta decks that are hot right now, he stop opponent to add more card from deck  1x Zoodiac Raptier  Normal summon and send 1 Zoodiac card to graveyard, also can special summon other Zoodiac monster.

The strategy here is to defend against enemy monsters using the various effects of low level monsters until you are able to either synchro summon or XYZ summon a more powerful monster to go on the offensive, but Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat has been selected as the deck master due to the powerful combo of Spiritual Forest, Mage Power, and the cards own ability to attack the opponents life points directly for half damage as well as enter the spell and trap zone upon destruction in battle as opposed to being sent to the graveyard.

I've gotten into Yu-Gi-Oh from a couple friends over last winter, and after they weaseled me in and taught me the lowdown, it was my job to research a deck that caught my eye. Fortunately for me after some jumping around, I stuck around with the psychic type. Initially my build took large inspiration from JDGaming's various psychic profiles for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/BEKwNLwXDgU"">Banish Psychics</a> and later <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/7MeXC3DB1ys"">General Psychics</a>, which I highly recommend checking out if my build isn't your style. Credits to him for a number of ideas this deck uses.  I personalized it with some additional Synchro utility and toyed with the extra deck to make it feel more uniform. This harps on its extent of damage but in exchange offers more removal tools and summoning materials to make up for your aggro effectivity. Don't shrug it off yet, though! Lets do a rundown on the vital aspects of this deck.  <hr /> <p><span>Main Playstyle</span></p> First off, a key tool to give psychics the upper hand is the one additional summon <a data-name=""Brain Research Lab"">Brain Research Lab</a> allows for all psychic type monsters. Your 1~4 star monsters in your hand can be applied in a single turn to lead to quick extra deck plays or you can bounce off your first summon for <a data-name=""Overdrive Teleporter"">Overdrive Teleporter</a> who can use it's effect for one psychic counter instead of 2000 life points. It's important to be wary if the opponent has field removal tools as overuse of Lab's effect could bite you in the ass, so your mileage may vary on how frequent you should rely on it.  Using <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a> as Synchro tools together lets Riser, Jiujiu and Psyhemuth stand on their own feet more, or if you're summoning them from O.D. Teleporter, you can scrap him after use for Shenshen. Once he's on the field, Shenshen chucks all monsters sent to the GY to the banish zone instead, including your own. This is how you can modulate your discarded monsters to fit your needs.  While lower level monsters can be revived using <a data-name=""Telekinetic Power Well"">Telekinetic Power Well</a>, you can let your tuners and mid-level monsters (extra summons included) bleed into your banish zone so you can resurrect them using <a data-name=""Psychic Feel Zone"">Psychic Feel Zone</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Tuning"">Psychic Tuning</a>. Omega benefits from the former the most since Gamma and Driver get banished anyway after quick effect, and his effect to trim the opponent's hand will let you reset his position to attack next turn.  The Assault Engine goes from <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> get <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> &gt; sack Beast &gt; get <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a> &gt; Reflector summon Beast to field. This deck contains no level 7 extra deck monsters, so be wary not to boost him to Level 6 if you're using Reflector as a tuner. See more in regards to side deck recommendations at the end. Patch up Reflector with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> if the chain gets interrupted.  The psychic mages—as I like to call them—can banish monsters from your GY in order to special summon them. Cleric gets the most mileage out of this effect for his DEF stat and how you can also force the effect from a Synchro or Link summon using him as material. And using any of them to bring back <a data-name=""Esper Girl"">Esper Girl</a> is a good opportunity to make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast;</a> A decent attacker but a fantastic multi-use negator that feeds your GY.  From there, with both discard zones at your disposal, you can shift them around depending on your use for them. The best use for all those monsters in your graveyard comes into play when you manage to make <a data-name=""Overmind Archfiend"">Overmind Archfiend</a>, with a whopping 3300 ATK without trackers can big dick the field for a bit while banishing as many monsters you can manage to special summon when he gets killed.  <hr /> <p><span>Other Features</span></p> <a data-name=""Risebell the Star Adjuster"">Risebell the Star Adjuster</a> is a jack-of-all-trades. Candidate for O.D. Teleporter, E-tele, GY revival, and can increase it's level or another monster's if you can't bring back beast.  Halq is in here to get out another tuner to use as materials or offer extra protection. It can summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a> with its quick effect, who can in itself summon a tuner with it's effect negated. Marcher itself works with Tracker and Wheeleder's effect to get them on the field.  <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> for using Gamma's effect even with monsters on your field, since they're your most valuable handtraps.  <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> is in for additional backbone for when you really need to kick a boss monster's teeth in. Can't be made using Marcher.  And <a data-name=""Virtual World Dragon - Longlong"">Virtual World Dragon - Longlong</a> and <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a> serve as situational flavor to the deck, and functional summons if you can't get a tuner out. Leviair acts as an additional banish search for any of your main deck monsters except O.D. Teleporter and Driver.  <hr /> <p><span>Side Deck Recommendations</span></p> I decided not to include a side deck since a lot of options will likely be situational for the current meta. My personal choices go as follows: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Psychic Lifetrancer"">Psychic Lifetrancer</a> and <a data-name=""Magical Android"">Magical Android</a> for stalling or regaining LP in a pinch. Lifetrancer serves as an applicable level 7 monster for Assault Beast to go into and Android could easily climb into Omega or <a data-name=""Thought Ruler Archfiend"">Thought Ruler Archfiend</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> for any Link monster substitutions needed to combat higher tier decks, like <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, M<a data-name=""ekk-knight Crusadia Avramax"">ekk-knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, the Knightmares, etc.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> whom I used to use back when my deck followed JDGaming's profile much closer. Much easier to get out than Crystal Wing with a diet variant of it's effects.</li>  	<li>Nibiru, Dark Ruler No More, and Forbidden Droplet as fundamental failsafes.</li> </ul>  <hr /> <p><span>Conclusion</span></p> If you try out my deck, feel free to comment your thoughts, or drop a like if you like it! Since I've only had a couple of months in the game, I'm open to critiques and recommendations to spruce this deck up! Deck is subject to change in the future!"

This deck took lots of playtesting and work to make so I hope you appreciate it! I'll still be open for suggestions!,"<span>So I put in all of my effort to make this build including a side deck and everything and this is my most detailed guide yet. I’m hoping that everyone likes this deck, before anything I just want to say thanks to all of those players who tolerated my 14 handtraps that I play when they were going against this deck during my test runs. Without further ado, let’s get into it!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First I’ll explain what Crusadia is before anything else. Crusadia is an archetype from the world legacy lore that utallizes link monsters to link climb. All Crusadia main deck monsters can special summon themselves to the field for a spot a link monster points to and are either level 3 or level 4, they also have additional effects including layering protection, clearance, boosting, and so on. The Crusadia monsters in the extra deck share an effect where they gain attack points equal to the origenal attack points of the monsters they point to. Most of them also trigger an effect when an effect monster is special summoned to a zone they point to. The idea is to link climb to the link monster Cursadia Equimax as soon as possible and boost it with the cursadia effects of the main deck. Crusadia Equimax is a 2000 attack point monster who gains the attack points of monsters it points to, but it prevents those monsters from attacking. It also sports the ability to tribute a crusadia or world legacy monster it points to and then negate the effects of a monster on the field giving us standard contol.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I’ll start the list now</span>  &nbsp;

 <span>1 Red Reboot (very helpful)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The main thing to do is link climb to accessscode or equimax and then let it carry you. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Acesscode combo: 2 Crusades with different names</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Normal first Crusadia (this one can’t be draco)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Crusadia to Magius</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Special second crusadia (if draco recycle the first one with it’s effect)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Magius adds draco (or another crusadia with a different name if the second Crusadia is draco) from your deck to your hand</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link second Crusadia with Magius to make regulex</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Third crusadia summons self (if draco then return the first crusadia to your hand)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Regulex search a card (your pick depending on situation)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Regulex and third Crusadia for equimax</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First Crusadia summons itself</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Equimax with first Crusadia to make accesscode</span>  &nbsp;  <span>You now have a 5300 triple pop monster who’s immune to effects</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Equimax otk combo: Maxumis or Leonis and a Draco along with a third Crusadia that’s not a Draco</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Maxumis/Leonis</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link Maximus/Leonis for Mangius</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Draco to Mangius, then recycle Maxumis/Leonis and add the other one from your deck  to your hand, if the other one is already in your hand then get Arorbia</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Mangius link with Draco to make Regulex</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon third crusadia to Regulex’s zone</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Regulex search Revival</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link the third Crusadia with regulex to make Equimax</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Activate Revival</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Summon Maximus and Leonis to Equimax’s zones (this’ll make Equimax total at 5300)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Maximus, Leonis, and Revival’s effects and target Equimax, now it does double damage, piercing damage, and can attack all monsters your opponent controls. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side tips:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 You can use Spatha to move a Crusadia and get a second one that’ll allow you to overlay</span>  <span>2 As long as you have two Crusadias in your hand you didn’t brick</span>  <span>3 Only summon knightmare phoenix when you know there will still be a main monster zone on your side with an arrow or else it’ll end your turn</span>  <span>4 Halq can help bring out 3 crusadias, arabia and the two empty zones it points to</span>  <span>5 Pankratops can be used to make links if necessary, don’t be scared to use it for that</span>  <span>6 You can use Arorbia to save Reculsa or a Phantom Knight of Break Sword target</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Other options:</span>  <span>Kaijus can out things and then place themselves into Equimax’s zone</span>  <span>You can play more world legacy cards if you want</span>  <span>My handtrap ratios are just me, you can use yours</span>  <span>Overall this is a pretty consistent deck that provides a great amount of interruptions and multiple layers of protection and then can suddenly otk with the use of Equimax. This is one of my favorite decks in the game currently and I worked very hard on this deck.</span>"

If performed successfully, your oponent must get rid of 3 XZY bodies of 2800 ATK that cannot be destroyed by card effects and a single omni-negate, using only 5 cards or less, otherwise, they'll die.  You must send Red-Eyes monsters as quickly as possible to the GY in order to trigger Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon's effect and start to summon multiple level 7 monsters to your field. While using Rokket strategy to summon guardragons in order to get those same monsters, and end up summoning Borreload Savage Dragon.  This deck is best suited for going first. Of course, there are two huge absents in this deck: Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, which isn't in this game, and Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, which is banned in this game for some reason.  Keep in mind that this deck is only meant to be played in this game, the format, card pool, banlist and playing mindset is very different from that of TCG, even compared to the format closest to this game (March 2020 pre-ETCO)."
