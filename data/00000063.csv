Turns out it counters Ryzeal and Maliss!,"<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose"">Ryzeal has 6+ pops? Maliss has 4+ banishes? BRANDED DON'T CARE!!!<br /><br />Branded still remains relevant as ever in Masterduel ladder, even with Ryzeal and Maliss dominating the ranks! Both deck's main source of interruption are destruction and banishment, which is something that Albaz and friends easily shrug off. With these decks dominating the meta without much negates, there is little to nothing to stop Branded from fusion summoning an imposing army of powerful fusion monsters!&nbsp;<br /><br />Branded just can't stop winning, and so can you!&nbsp;<br /><br />First - we get more extremely cool alt. arts and accessories. Second, with the recent banlist, Masterduel has given Branded back it's second copy of its most powerful card - Branded Fusion! This is huge for the deck. Not only does it add more consistency to the deck, but it can play better after using the first copy of Branded Fusion! Typically, once the first copy Is used, then the Branded player would have to do fancy footwork to recycle the Branded Fusion in the GY to use it again. But not anymore! Now we can search for the second copy from deck and keep on playing! (I'm hoping the TCG gets back its second copy of Branded Fusion soon).&nbsp;<br /><br />Due to the second Branded Fusion's consistency boost, in addition to Maxx ""C"" I've opted to max out on Mulcharmies in 60 card Branded. This addendum playing 3 Purulia and 3 Fuwalos to give the pilot a better chance at going second. If you happen to draw one of them going first, they can be used as discard fodder with Lubellion the Searing Dragon, Branded Opening, Super Polymerization or used as fusion material for Guardian Chimera. If you activate one (or two) of these fluffy Maxx C knock-offs, most likely your opponent is making a sub-standard board so you won't draw as much (If your opponent is too generous, your additional draws should give you enough gas to destroy your opponent). From there, your incredibly powerful and consistent Branded engine should carry you to victory!&nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise, Branded plays the usual. Power through and win with brute force and sheer card advantage via fusion summoning with Albaz and friends!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!<br /><br /><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

Trust.,"<p>Whats better then full combo Primte Blue-Eyes? full combo Primte Blue-Eyes with Desirae. This deck can set up triple negate boards plus drillbeam in the back for that extra layer of onion the opponent has to peel. Flood gates like kyubi can be a solid end board against K9 and especially Yummy. Uninterrupted, you can set up a even more deadly board then with regular primte variants, and with the fiendsmith cards to bait out handtraps and check for nib and drolls, youll be set up to play the rest of the engine as you please. Either side of the deck can bridge into eachother, and handtraps are purely preference. Naval dragon mech and Kyubi slots can be filled with whatever tech you'd like namely chaos angel, and indigo-eyes. Either Way this (In my opinion) is the most consistent and deadly way to plays this deck as of right now, Post JUHU. Mutiple local wins under the belt. plan to take this List to YCS Anahiem. Have Fun!</p>"

It's not the third best, nor is it the fourth best. Maybe it's like the sixth or seventh best Flip Monster in the Deck if you don't count Prediction Princess Bibliomuse, but the reason for that is that SoI, while it can definitely Summon cards with a whole lot of stopping power like <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=99916754"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/99916754.jpg"" data-card=""99916754"" data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</span></a>, is pretty gimmicky more than anything else. It doesn't solve the Deck's weakness against handtraps or boardbreakers, and it really is not your first choice of Flip Monster if you are looking for a card that just ends the game as soon as your opponent has no way around it like, Deus-X, PIXIEA, Whirlwind Weasel, Guard Dog, or even Pot of the Forbidden if you use it to look at your opponent's hand and shuffle their starter back into the Deck. If I had to make an analogy, it is like nước mắm in spaghetti sauce. You can just season your spaghetti sauce with salt to taste, but I like&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">nước mắm for its added richness and umami in addition to its saltiness. So I add it to my sauce whenever I make spaghetti despite possibly angering traditionalist Italians. I don't have to add&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">nước mắm to the spaghetti sauce, but I like it because it makes it more fun and interesting to eat. Prediction Princess is the spaghetti sauce and Summoner of Illusions is the&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">nước mắm. You don't have to add Summoner of Illusions to Prediction Princess, but it can make the Deck a little more fun and interesting to play around with, especially with all of the Fusion Monster options that I listed.</span></span></p>"

Both strategies can easily spam out level 5s for XYZ/Synchro summons and either archetype can pivot into the other. Simultaneously raising the power ceiling and consistency of Crystron, K9 offers extension when interrupted, insulation from handtraps, board clearance, and extra ways to access the Crystron engine! As a result of this consistency boost, the Crystron engine has transformed into a ultra compact set of cards! Wielding more non-engine than ever and packing a perfect support archetype, Crystron remains meta relevant as it carves a niche for itself in a post-Justice Hunters metagame!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

It is composed of 2 Sulfefnir, 3 Sulfador, 1 Thystvern. 1 Smiger, 1 Tristaros, 3 Inclusion and 1 Cluster. The Extra Deck only has 1 Eleskeletus. The minimal Crystron count works fine since they are recyclable with Cluster should the duel be an extended grindgame.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>K9</strong>&nbsp;cards are a support archetype designed in this strategy to strengthen and protect Crystron plays. It is composed of 3 Jokul, 1 Lantern, 3 Izuna, 1 Lupis, 1 ""A Case for K9"", and 1 Forced Release. In total, it consists of 10 cards.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>CONSISTENCY </strong>cards are used in this deck to search for starters and extenders. 3 Chaotic Elements (searches Jokul/Lantern) and Foolish Burial (sends Smiger/Thystvern for Crystron searches) are in the maindeck. In the sidedeck, 3 Foolish Burial Goods and 1 Clockwork Night are used to search for Recycler, which in turn sends Crystron monsters to the GY.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The rest of the cards in this strategy are <strong>STAPLES</strong>, handpicked to counter meta threats and to synergize with K9 Crystron. 3 Ash Blossom and 1 Called By are used to counter Mulcharmies. 1 Talents is used to punish your opponents for using handtraps or to draw 2 for extenders. 3 Fuwalos and 2 Imperm are used since they are strong generic handtraps. Finally, 3 Droplet is used since it can crack boards wide open while simultaneously setting up your GY with Crystron cards for additional plays. Droplet can also counter turn 0 plays made by your opponent, whether they be Izuna or Arthalion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">K9 Crystron functions as an adaptable midrange combo deck, easily able to set up 8+ interruption boards, or low-to-the-ground set-ups if hit by a floodgate handtrap like Droll or Mulcharmies. Able to shrug off minor handtraps and interruption with ease due to the consistency of hands, the resilience of it's combo pieces, and the sheer power of its layered negate/destruction endboard, K9 can overpower most meta strategies when piloted correctly. Going second, the deck can power through interruption, especially with hands that feature a lot of gas (which is often the case). Boards can be broken easily as the combo naturally has ways to crack boards (for ex. S:P Little Knight and Cyber Dragon Infinity), especially in the battlephase as you hit over everything with Eleskeletus' ATK drop and the K9 ATK boost. Zeus is easily made in this deck, easily allowing the pilot to reset the gamestate and then combo off from there!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">There are many combos available to K9 Crystron depending on what hand you have, but this is the most used standard combo:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Any level 5 + K9 Jokul</em>&nbsp;</strong>= Crystron Cluster (1 targeted pop of a face-up card), Crystron Tristaros (Synchro summon F.A Dawn Dragster - S/T negate), K9 Ripper (negate of monster effect in hand/GY), K9 Izuna in-hand (XYZ summon of rank 5 toolbox during opponent's turn), Cyber Dragon Infinity (omni-negate), Follow-up for next turn</div><ol style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_42""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">Activate Jokul's in-hand effect to summon itself and another level 5 from your hand.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">Activate Jokul's on-field effect to search for K9 Lantern.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">XYZ summon K9 Ripper using Jokul + level 5.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">Activate K9 Ripper's effect to search for ""A Case for K9"" by detaching Jokul.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">&nbsp;Activate Lantern's in-hand effect targeting Jokul in GY to summon both to the field.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">Activate Lantern's effect to search for K9 Forced Release.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"" role=""presentation"">XYZ summon Infinitrack River Stormer using Jokul + Lantern.

Handtraps can change depending on what rank your in or what matchups your mostly playing against. i dont reccomend going over 40 because the more consistantly you can get a starting hand with gateway the better. Your end board should be (4 mat Appo with I:P protection, Legendary samurai Kizan for a pop on their turn, Lord Samurai Shi En for monster negate and destroy, Legendary Shi en for spell/trap negate and destroy, Baronne for an omni negate, Savage dragon for a omi negate) of course handtraps can cause your end boards to look different but there are plenty of going second options in the deck also to clear their boards and plenty of other end boards that will disrupt them within the deck list. I dont do youtube but if the deck gets enough feedback, or if people are intersted in seeing the combos i can start my channel and show you all how the deck performs and the optimal combos.

In my Honorable Mentions list of monsters for SoI, I mentioned that&nbsp;<strong>Ojama King</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Ojama Knight</strong>, blocking off up to 3 and up to 2 of your opponent's unused Main Monster Zones, respectively, doesn't actually do anything since your opponent could theoretically still play around a few of the MMZs being locked if they had a way to deal with the other threat your board presented,&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong>. And while this list was supposed to be the Dinosaur Runick Prediction Princess list, I had a revelation on how to use both Ojama King and Knight, and decided to explain my Dino Runick PPrincess list while also showing off this incredibly gimmicky gameplan this Deck has that revolves around either&nbsp;<strong>Ojama King&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>Ojama Knight</strong> and the card I completely forgot came out:<strong>&nbsp;Gorgon of Zilofthonia</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Gorgon of Zilofthonia is a LINK-3 monster with all 3 of its Link Arrows pointing upwards (Up, Upper-Left, Upper-Right). Neither player can Summon/Set monsters to the zones that it points to and monsters it points to cannot attack and have their effects negated. Essentially, Zilofthonia will basically renders 3 of your opponent's Main Monster Zones that it points to unusable as they cannot Summon/Set monsters to those Zones. If you pair that up with either Ojama King or Ojama Knight and block the other Main Monster Zones that Zilofthonia does not point to, you have basically created a terrible way of locking up all 5 of your opponent's Main Monster Zones, for the turn since the Ojama will be destroyed during the End Phase due to being Special Summoned off of SoI. It's really gimmicky and loses to any piece of removal or any piece of negation, but innovation stops for no one, despite how bad some of those ideas may be.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Full combo is any way to get to&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> and any Runick Quick-Play Spell. In this Deck, that would be&nbsp;<strong>Souleating Oviraptor</strong> and any Runick Quick-Play Spell like&nbsp;<strong>Runick Tip</strong>. Normal Summon Oviraptor and activate its effect to add&nbsp;<strong>Jurrac Megalo</strong> from Deck to hand. Activate Megalo in hand to Special Summon it because you control a Dinosaur monster. Synchro Megalo and Oviraptor into&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong>. On Synchro Summon, Ib adds&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> from Deck to hand. Activate Tip to Special Summon <strong>Sleipnir the Runick Mane</strong> to the EMZ. Activate Monstrosity targeting Sleipnir to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> from Deck. Xyz Sleipnir and Pot into&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> who sends&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon. Herald triggers in GY to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> from Deck to hand. Activate Aggregator's other effect, targeting Herald in GY, detaching 1 material, and attaching Herald from GY. Link Aggregator and Ib into&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. Herald triggers as it is sent to GY again and searches for&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>. Activate Underworld Ritual to Ritual Summon Tarotrei by tributing Bibliomuse. Bibliomuse triggers off of being tributed and Special Summons herself back from GY face-down. Tarotrei activates to flip Bibliomuse face-up, and then Bibliomuse's Flip Effect activates to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> and another Underworld Ritual from Deck to hand. Activate Underworld Ritual to Ritual Summon Tarotreith face-down by tributing Bibliomuse. During the End Phase, Tarotrei activates to Special Summon Pot from GY face-down. During your opponent's Standby Phase, banish Underworld Ritual from GY to Special Summon Bibliomuse from Deck face-down and activate Tarotrei's effect to flip Tarotreith face-up. Tarotreith's Flip Effect activates to Special Summon<strong> Summoner of Illusions</strong> from Deck face-down. On a new Chain, Tarotreith's other effect can be used to flip Bibliomuse, Pot, and SoI face-up. Bibliomuse's Flip Effect searches for a Prediction Princess monster and a Ritual Spell from Deck for follow-up while giving your Ritual Monsters targeting and destruction protection from your opponent's card effects. Pot's Flip Effect activates which allows you to look at your opponent's hand and shuffle a card from it back into their Deck. Try to get rid of something that can either destroy or negate your cards. And SoI can Tribute your spent Tarotreith to Special Summon <strong>Ojama King</strong> from Extra Deck. When Ojama King hits the field, it allows you to block off 3 of your opponent's unused MMZs. Block 3 of them off starting from the far left or far right, moving in. During your opponent's Main Phase, I:P can perform a Link Summon using itself and your spent Tarotrei to Link Summon&nbsp;<strong>Gorgon of Zilofthonia</strong> into the correct EMZ so that Zilofthonia points to the MMZs that Ojama King didn't block off. Now, your opponent basically cannot use their MMZs and hopefully Pot got rid of the card in your opponent's hand that can break the lock.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck Monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

For the dinosaur engine, we are playing 1 <strong>Miscellaneousaurus</strong>, 3 <strong>Souleating Oviraptor</strong>, and 1 <strong>Jurrac Megalo</strong>. I think I actually prefer this Dinosaur engine over the <strong>Draconnet</strong> engine from my last Runick Prediction Princess list. I just think that these dino cards make getting to <strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> a whole lot easier and much more flexible than what Draconnet and a Level 2 Normal Tuner can provide. Misc can Quick Effect send itself from hand to GY during the Main Phase to make your Dinosaur monsters unaffected by your opponent's activated effects during this Main Phase. And, you can banish it from GY along with any other number of Dinosaurs from your GY to Special Summon a Dinosaur from Deck with a Level equal to the total number of monsters you banished, but it is destroyed during the End Phase. Oviraptor </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">takes a Dinosaur monster from your Deck and either adds it to hand or sends it to GY on Normal or Special Summon. That's pretty much all that we are using it for, but just like in the combo I described earlier, Oviraptor just makes Ib on its own through searching for Megalo. Speaking of, we are pretty much only using Megalo for its effect in hand which allows you to Special Summon it if you control a Dinosaur monster. Megalo, being the Tuner in this engine to make Ib, is already a whole lot more flexible than a Level 2 vanilla Tuner when you are playing Draconnet. Sure, if you draw just Megalo and a Runick Spell or just the Level 2 vanilla Tuner and a Runick Spell, you can Normal Summon them and use the Runick Spell for either the Level 4 <strong>Geri the Runick Fangs</strong> or the Level 3 <strong>Munin the Runick Wings</strong>, and then make Ib from there. That's fine and all, but Megalo can still Special Summon itself from your hand if you control a Dinosaur monster. You could argue that Draconnet can Summon the Level 2 vanilla tuner from hand, but if Draconnet gets negated, you've just spent your Normal Summon on Draconnet, have no way to get the tuner on field to make Ib, and are pretty much a sitting duck. However, if you open Ovi and Megalo, you can try to bait out interaction by Normal Summoning Ovi and attempting to use its effect to search for Misc or even another copy of itself because it can. And if that is stopped, you can just Special Summon Megalo from hand. Not to mention that if you draw Ovi and Misc and your stupid brain did not activate Misc before Normal Summoning Ovi, you can still activate Misc in hand, send it to GY, and then banish itself from GY to Special Summon the Level 1 Megalo from Deck. You can also search Megalo off of <strong>Fossil Dig</strong> as well, unlike the vanilla tuners you are playing for Draconnet. None of them are Cyberse monsters, so you can't even use <strong>Cynet Mining </strong>to theoretically search for them.

Despite being left out of most tier lists, the deck has proven itself at both locals and larger events, consistently putting up strong results and catching meta players off guard. What makes the deck powerful is its ability to grind through games by looping Apopus traps, specifically Aous the Serpent and Swamp Deity, which provide a constant stream of omni-negates. On top of that, cards like Verdict of Anubis and Statue of Anguish Pattern give the deck additional win conditions, allowing it to close games in unexpected ways.</p><p data-start=""851"" data-end=""1562"">The main deck is built to maximize consistency and flexibility. Anubis, the Last Judge and Man with the Mark act as reliable one-card starters, while the Apopus ratio of two Serpent and three Swamp Deity ensures access to the core loop without overcommitting to bricks. Verdict of Anubis, while technically situational, has stolen games outright, making it a worthwhile inclusion. Treasure of the Kings, supported by Terraforming, is the best opener in the deck and can play around Droll effectively. I also chose to incorporate the Kashira package&mdash;Unicorn, Fenrir, Birth, and Pressure Planet&mdash;which performed extremely well by disrupting opponents early, especially with Unicorn ripping key extra deck pieces.</p><p data-start=""1564"" data-end=""2038"">Rather than relying heavily on hand traps, the deck leans into board breakers to deal with the meta. Super Polymerization, Eclipse, and Droplet are all included to dismantle boards proactively while recycling traps in the process. The only hand trap I ran was Droll, which remains too impactful to ignore, particularly against strategies like Yummy and Vanquish Soul. This balance between proactive disruption and recursive grind power is what makes the deck so resilient.</p><p data-start=""2040"" data-end=""2657"">The extra deck is designed to support both the Apopus engine and the board-breaking approach. Cards like Ty-phon pair well with Treasure of the Kings, while Selene and Accesscode provide a reliable finishing route after a grindy game, even allowing wins through Nibiru. Super Poly targets and niche tech like Secretarian Dragon round out the lineup, ensuring answers to a wide range of threats. The side deck, meanwhile, shifts depending on whether I&rsquo;m going first or second: Mind Drain and Soul Drain are devastating when going first, while cards like Raigeki, Eclipse, and Spooky Dogwood shine when playing second.</p><p data-start=""2659"" data-end=""3199"">Overall, Temple of the Kings is not just a gimmick deck but a serious contender. Its recursive trap loops generate consistent advantage, and its side deck adaptability lets it handle diverse matchups. Many opponents underestimate it, but once the Apopus engine gets going, the deck feels almost unfair, recycling omni-negates and punishing overextension. My performance at YCS Vancouver is proof of its potential, and I believe the deck deserves far more recognition as a legitimate rogue strategy capable of competing with the top tiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Zub is a level 5 and can search any Constellar monster from deck. Basically Jokul + Sulfudhole but the Walmart Version. Search Sheratan if normal summon is not used and then search Caduceus. Caduceus is a free special summon if you control a Constellar monster and can search a Constellar spell or trap. Pleades is not summoned very often and probsbly should be cut because it cannot be summoned a lot but I really like the card. Link off Caduceus and Sheratan for a link 2 in my case I chose Masquerena.</p>

The one problem is the archetype is so old and the best cards lock you into Chronomaly only and they can't do very much on their own. The gameplan is to have Jokul and summon out level 5 monsters from hand to combo. Also the deck has only one searcher total and its only on normal summon. The spell/traps are also not good at all. Technology wouldn't be bad if it didn't lock into Chronomaly only. The deck needs more searchers, More XYZ monsters, and a clear gameplan. The deck has the ability to swarm the board but they have a combination of Burn cards and other cards that don't work well together. Tula Guardian is a cool extender vs any deck that sets up a field spell (Yummy, VS, etc). I was considering Golden Jet but its just too slow in my opinion.</p>"

This deck is cool and fun man but its just not good enough. The K9 cards help get Gravitino out of hand and get your combo started. Dog Tag is also a level 5 and can summon itself from hand. S-Force Link monsters are good and have great utility and interaction.The one problem is that S-Force has 0 1 card combos. It has a couple 2 card combos that are not bad.</p>

Noroi is played as few hands ever necessitate an NS, meaning you can sometimes Appointer your opponent turn 1 for free by sending Case/itself.

At least that's what is says in arc pendulum's flavour text.,"<p>*Replace ""Regenesis Code"" with ""Regenesis"" normal spell that searches Regenesis monsters. Couldn't find it for some reason.*</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck aims to utilize the kashtira engine and the regenesis monsters to set up free bodies to facilitate the main pendulum combo, as well as set up layered forms of interaction in the endboard. In theory, both these engine can also serve as handtrap bait in Game 1 and make your opponent think you are playing a ""good"" deck. Regenesis archfiend search sage can also act to insulate ""Beyond the pendulum"" from handtraps or archfiend can grab Regenesis birth, if archfiend is needed as material to make ""beyond the pendulum"".&nbsp;</p><p>Playing the kashtira package with birth and unicorn gives the deck some additonal follow up, something pendulum is notorious for lacking. There are some anti-synergies with the kashtira monsters and dragon shrine, but the free bodies, endboard interactions, and board breaking capabilites of the kashtira monsters are worth that risk. Wraitsoth also boosts your monsters by about 300-500 ATK due to the variety of attributes this deck is ends on.</p><p>Both the kashtira and regenesis engines are made of level 7 monsters (with the exception of archfiend), which aid in making absolute dragon and the subsequent summoning of vortex dragon</p><p>This deck has about 16 ways to get gate magician and 10 ways to get darkwurm, but the main pendulum core often lacks a good way to get to a second body on board, which has been partly resolved by playing the two other engines. Beyond the pendulum will most often be grabbing lightwurm to faciliate pendulum summons or Arc pendulum to get the brick out of the deck and make absolute dragon, if lightwurm is already in hand.</p><p>The deck often dies to about 2 handtraps on average, depending on how many engines are in the opening hand, and it instantly dies to ""Droll &amp; lock bird"".</p><p>Good luck to anyone who decides to play this deck.</p>"

This is the most playable compilation of my card pool as it stands, and is essentially just a Level/Rank 4 beatdown deck with a few just barely useable traps thrown in. &nbsp;</p><p>MVP's: <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=49729312"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49729312.jpg"" data-card=""49729312"" data-name=""Primineral Kongreat"">Primineral Kongreat</span></a> Pulled as one of my original 40, won me a few of my first games. <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=47504322"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/47504322.jpg"" data-card=""47504322"" data-name=""War Rock Wento"">War Rock Wento</span></a> Another one of my original 40, far and away my most consistent Normal summonable beater. <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=1688285"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/1688285.jpg"" data-card=""1688285"" data-name=""Traptrix Pinguicula"">Traptrix Pinguicula</span></a> The Maliss Killer!(yes, people were playing it in Bronze/Silver lol) A bit of a later pull, but absolutely amazing when I was able to get it out and completely unexpected value aside from being a generic Rank 4. <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=43940008"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/43940008.jpg"" data-card=""43940008"" data-name=""Duel Tower"">Duel Tower</span></a> One of the few actually useable spells I pulled, but oh man did it come through when I needed it.

Give that Ryzeal deck of yours a little bit more... OOMPH with Fiendsmith!,"<p>Do you feel like your Ryzeal deck is lacking a bit of power? Do you suffer from consistency issues and lack that one level 4 to go into your Ryzeal combo? Adding Fiendsmith to is the perfect solution for you!&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiendsmith adds an extra layer(s) of interaction for your Ryzeal endboard, whether that is D/D/D Wave High King Caesar (x2 summon negate), Fiendsmith Dies Irae (field negate), or Fiendsmith Paradise in the graveyard (targeted send). Fiendsmith also allows more grindgame for the Ryzeal pilot, allowing the duelist to have more resources since Fiendsmith resource loop replenishes itself in the GY and hand. <br /><br />The synergy with Ryzeal is that Lacrima of the Crimson Tears is also level 4, which gives you an additional extender to go into Ryzeal combo with! This means that every Fiendsmith starter is also a Ryzeal starter, thus making the entire rank 4 strategy of Ryzeal much more powerful!&nbsp;<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Here, I present you the deck I choose to play in this month's Theme Chronicle, Plunder Patroll. It focuses on using your viking pirates/crew members (the ""beards"") to summon powerful men-of-war from your Extra Deck, which serve as both disruption and as a resource loop. The ships that you can summon depend on the attributes in your opponent's field and GY, so be ready for a little attribute manipulation too.<br /><br />Despite not being the greatest deck ever, it is very fun to play once you get setup - so much that it was one of the decks that changed my mind on modern Yu-Gi-Oh.

Dracotail!&nbsp;<br /><br />Unlike other versions of the deck which require sacky Shaddol bricks or a very ""neggy"" Dragoon, Jesse Kotton has opted to go all-in on handtraps! Out of 40 cards, TWENTY of them are handtraps! <br /><br />Theoretically, your opponent would be hardpressed to play through all those handtraps, then Dracotail can smash through any ""half-board"" they would make. The interruptions Dracotail can make with it's two traps (1 bounce of ATK position monster, 1 spell negate, 1 pop with Gulamel, 1 fuse with Faimena) backed by handtraps are also very difficult for any meta deck to play through. The game boils down to proper usage of handtraps and interruptions - forcing a simplified gamestate where the superior Dracotail engine can flourish!<br /><br />Cartesia was chosen as Jesse Kotton's fusion engine of choice since it recovers itself from the GY, is a quick effect (it can be used to fusion summon during your turn AND opponent's turn), and is a spellcaster, so it can be used to create specific fusion bosses like Secreterion Dragon.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a>If you want more details about this deck, check out Jesse Kotton's deck profile video by clicking here.&nbsp;</a><br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

That means you end with AT LEAST one negate, one destruction prevention with Baelynx, one destruction/revive with Princess which you can use Raging for cost to revive the Raging in the graveyard with 5600 Atk, and the revival effect of Raging in case you didn't use it in the previous point. If you're filthy rich in materials, which can happen, you can even use Code of Soul to Ressurection Link Summon a Pyro Pheonix on the enemy's turn for a board wipe! It's super hard to fully grind to a halt because of all the recursion, the amount of handtraps means you will probably have at least two in starting, and it's out of meta, so there's a chance it'll catch people off guard.</p><p>ENJOY!</p>"

I noticed that to an extent, Adamancipators can influence what cards are on top of the deck. If you are able to stack the deck, you can resolve cards such as Archfiend's Oath, Afterglow, and The True Name, the card which inspired this project! Now this deck is not perfect, and there will likely be times where you will have to guess what is on top of the deck. Fortunately, even if you can't stack the deck, you can at least take an educated guess based on what you've used so far as well as the cards you've placed on the bottom in a given turn.

First of all, you needed to open some number of these Insect monsters in a Deck that could more or less not play Resonance Insect to the best of its ability. Second, there were no great ways of putting a 1500 DEF Insect monster on field for Picofalena to equip Beargram from Deck to to make it at least a 2000 DEF Insect monster equipped with an Equip Card to Tribute to Special Summon Ultimate Great Insect.

But, let&rsquo;s begin on where my previous list failed. First of all, it was a list that I made when I was focusing on experimenting with every Level 9 monster in the game to see which one could help to facilitate the best version of Prediction Princess. The Level 9 monster I focused on in my Predaplant Prediction Princess Deck was</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> Predaplant Triphyoverutum</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, a Level 9 Fusion Monster, that requires 3 DARK monsters on the field as Fusion Material. Triphyoverutum is not a hard monster to properly Summon, but when you compare it to many other Level 9 monsters, it requires more investment than those other monsters. So, the Level 9 monster I focused on was not the most optimal Level 9 monster to focus on. The second issue with the Deck is that it required the usage of </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">World Legacy Monstrosity</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> to get the necessary Level 9 bodies on field to make </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Mereologic Aggregator</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and prepare to transition to Prediction Princess plays. Monstrosity is not searchable in that Deck, so it is not the most reliable Deck for getting to full Prediction Princess combo. And third, because this Deck was the first time I even considered using a Predaplant engine to facilitate a Prediction Princess Deck, it was not my best attempt at doing so. There are so many Prediction Princess Decks that I have made after that which utilize the Predaplant engine way better, excluding the ones that also use </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Red Resonator</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> of course (but those were still great at getting to the worse of the Level 9&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve had to work with). But, I am speaking of Decks like Fiendsmith Prediction Princess (this list could still be updated to be better), Gold Pride Prediction Princess (I have an updated list I haven&rsquo;t put out yet), and Insect Prediction Princess. So, this new version of Predaplant Prediction Princess should get rid of the whole &ldquo;having to use Triphyoverutum&rdquo; part of it, not focus on using Monstrosity when it is not searchable, and it should make the best use out of not only the Predaplant engine, but the playable Predaplant cards as well.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">The cards you need to open for this Deck&rsquo;s combo are the exact same as for Insect Prediction Princess.

This deck can either lead to easy wins or devastating losses, depending on drawing luck. The most satisfying way to win is letting a bunch of Elemental Heroes get destroyed, then using Miracle Fusion to summon Shining Flare Wingman and boosting him to around 7000 ATK.

Are you a Yugi-boomer who wants to play Red-Eyes and Dark Magician competitively and win vs. try-hard meta decks like Ryzeal and Maliss? Well duelist, I have the answer for you - Primite Fiendsmith!<br /><br />Control your way to victory in a Maliss and Ryzeal dominated format with Primite Fiendsmith! Two grindy control strategies coupled with one of the most broken boss monsters ever printed - Dragoon, is surprisingly powerful! In a simplified gamestate, most meta decks would be hardpressed to out such a powerful juggernaut. Fiendsmith Desirae, Primite Drillbeam and Dragoon's recyclable omni-negates are a force to reckon with! Despite this deck's high power ceiling, Primite Fiendsmith can also play ""low-to-the-ground,"" not playing into common ""draw"" handtraps like Maxx ""C,"" Fuwalos and Purulia! High impact handtraps like Lancea, Droll and Nibiru common in today's metagame hardly affect this deck as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Force your opponent into a grindy control game with your 18 handtraps/staples and come out on top with the triple alliance of Primite, Fiendsmith and Dragoon!&nbsp;</p>"
