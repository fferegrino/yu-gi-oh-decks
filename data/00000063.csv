Turns out it counters Ryzeal and Maliss!,"<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose"">Ryzeal has 6+ pops? Maliss has 4+ banishes? BRANDED DON'T CARE!!!<br /><br />Branded still remains relevant as ever in Masterduel ladder, even with Ryzeal and Maliss dominating the ranks! Both deck's main source of interruption are destruction and banishment, which is something that Albaz and friends easily shrug off. With these decks dominating the meta without much negates, there is little to nothing to stop Branded from fusion summoning an imposing army of powerful fusion monsters!&nbsp;<br /><br />Branded just can't stop winning, and so can you!&nbsp;<br /><br />First - we get more extremely cool alt. arts and accessories. Second, with the recent banlist, Masterduel has given Branded back it's second copy of its most powerful card - Branded Fusion! This is huge for the deck. Not only does it add more consistency to the deck, but it can play better after using the first copy of Branded Fusion! Typically, once the first copy Is used, then the Branded player would have to do fancy footwork to recycle the Branded Fusion in the GY to use it again. But not anymore! Now we can search for the second copy from deck and keep on playing! (I'm hoping the TCG gets back its second copy of Branded Fusion soon).&nbsp;<br /><br />Due to the second Branded Fusion's consistency boost, in addition to Maxx ""C"" I've opted to max out on Mulcharmies in 60 card Branded. This addendum playing 3 Purulia and 3 Fuwalos to give the pilot a better chance at going second. If you happen to draw one of them going first, they can be used as discard fodder with Lubellion the Searing Dragon, Branded Opening, Super Polymerization or used as fusion material for Guardian Chimera. If you activate one (or two) of these fluffy Maxx C knock-offs, most likely your opponent is making a sub-standard board so you won't draw as much (If your opponent is too generous, your additional draws should give you enough gas to destroy your opponent). From there, your incredibly powerful and consistent Branded engine should carry you to victory!&nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise, Branded plays the usual. Power through and win with brute force and sheer card advantage via fusion summoning with Albaz and friends!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!<br /><br /><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

Trust.,"<p>Whats better then full combo Primte Blue-Eyes? full combo Primte Blue-Eyes with Desirae. This deck can set up triple negate boards plus drillbeam in the back for that extra layer of onion the opponent has to peel. Flood gates like kyubi can be a solid end board against K9 and especially Yummy. Uninterrupted, you can set up a even more deadly board then with regular primte variants, and with the fiendsmith cards to bait out handtraps and check for nib and drolls, youll be set up to play the rest of the engine as you please. Either side of the deck can bridge into eachother, and handtraps are purely preference. Naval dragon mech and Kyubi slots can be filled with whatever tech you'd like namely chaos angel, and indigo-eyes. Either Way this (In my opinion) is the most consistent and deadly way to plays this deck as of right now, Post JUHU. Mutiple local wins under the belt. plan to take this List to YCS Anahiem. Have Fun!</p>"
