the biggest downside of monke deck where his lack of OTK and the difficulty to get card advantage and that any backrow removal can be fatal. but now, you have still monster on board, so getting duster is not that bad because he still have to deal with the monsters, making the side of the board breakers hard to choose... Rather getting your cards get negate and popped with mechaba and DPE or skill drain and conq ? :p

the only card I can fear is evenly matched, banishing is not a great option in here (even tho I can pop DPE and a backrow to continue the card advantage)

Plus Accesscode is nice addition thanks to halq, and verte is fair and balanced lmao

After that it is to lock down the board with the use of Skill Drain, and Macro Cosmos. Originally, I had in place 2 copies of torrential tribute, and 2 copies of Summon Limit. I have relegated the Summon Limit to the extra deck when you know you are going first in a game 2 or game 3 scenario. Torrential Tribute was completely removed from this decklist due to the fact that Tearalaments now exist. There are other options available that include Solemn Strikes and/or some Solemn Judgement cards instead if so desired.</p><p>The main cards you want to see and utilize is Weather Painter Snow, Snowy Canvas, and Weather Forecast. These cards are integral in how you pump out your end-board to take control of the game. Some cards are included to directly access the cards you desire in case you draw a brick. Pot of Prosperity is the new replacement for the original searcher for this deck (Piri Reis Map) since the new reprint of the Pot of Prosperity has allowed it to be much more affordable. This will provide you a much more consistent search without the drawback of cutting your life points in half and being Ash'd at the beginning of main phase 1. Terraforming allows access into a copy of your Weather Forecast field spell.</p><p>As other recent deck postings have stated before, this deck archetype was very slow in comparison to other decks in the current state of Yugioh. The archetype allows you to out-grind your opponent after setting up a board with Rainbow and 3 omni-negates. If you can't get through it then you are fighting a losing battle and you won't be able to beat it.</p><p>Post-DIFO support (Konami, please give us Weather Painter Red!): The new support is very welcome as it allows the deck to be quicker to establish control of the board. Moonbow itself allows it to freely float into Rainbow if it gets destroyed while being a bit niche as it allows your main Weather Painter monsters connected to its arrows to have the effect to temp banish your opponent's monsters until the next standby phase. If any of your Weather Painter monsters are banished when Moonbow is link summoned you can summon one of those Weather Painter monsters. Weather Forecast is an absolute unit of a card as it puts this deck on turbo mode to push out Rainbow/Moonbow, hopefully on turn 1 via the ability to use your Weather Painter spell/trap cards to link into Weather Painter Rainbow/Moonbow and then add in a normal summon of a Weather Painter monster to one of the arrows to gain their effects.&nbsp; With the ways things are there are multiple ways to support this archetype. The deck is not very strong going second so it is a good idea to have something to interrupt your opponent. Dimension Shifter allows significant disruption with the current high tier decks floating around that utilize the graveyard. Droll and Lock Bird can be an option to be put in this deck to limit the amount of resource gain your opponent can make. I chose to go with Effect Veiler to have access into a solid monster negate and an easy option into a big Accesscode Talker via the integration of the Selene package using an Aussa Charmer link monster. One other that comes to mind is also playing kaijus with a single copy of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. If your opponent slams a big monster on the field that can interrupt your plays, kaijus can come in clutch and knock your opponent's plans around and allow you to more freely get Rainbow out and re-establish control of the board.</p><p>Extra Deck: The extra deck is as follows to have 3 Rainbow and 2 Moonbow. If the need arises you can create Moonbow and on destruction float into a copy of your Rainbow. I feel that 3 copies of Rainbow and 2 copies of Moonbow is pretty balanced. The XYZ monsters are fairly straight forward. The idea is to sling out a Zeus through Fortune Tune and Downerd Magician.</p><p>Non-Weather Painter Link Monsters: 1 x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians 1 x Accesscode Talker 1 x Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable 1 x Knightmare Phoenix 1 x Knightmare Unicorn 1 x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</p><p>Knightmare Phoenix is to protect Rainbow before climbing into something like Underworld Goddess of the Closed World. One other card that came to mind in the creation of this deck was a specific extra deck monster, Topologic Zereboros. I had not included it in the extra or the side as I felt it could be a bit too situational but interesting nonetheless. If you utilize Macro Cosmos and/or Dimensional Fissure early on to have your opponent banish a lot of their cards, then it can be seen as beneficial to summon a monster that gains attack for each card banished. Along with that, Topologic Zereboros has the ability to blanket banish wipe out the board with a summon to one of its arrows and summon itself back to be a big boss monster. I am curious what others might think of the card and how it may interact with this deck but if it is too situational then I feel good regardless as to where I left the extra deck in its place. It is my first time submitting a deck here and I am curious what others might think of this deck setup and how it can be improved. Keep in mind I am an older player that got back into the game a few months ago after originally stopping in 2005 so I know I may have included some cards that are not as great as other cards that can be included in this deck and my descriptions may not be as well articulated as others.</p>"

PRO:

- Literally end on THE Synchro boss monster, 3 onmi-negate ( <a data-name=""Shooting Majestic Star Dragon"">Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</a> , <a data-name=""Cosmic Blazar Dragon"">Cosmic Blazar Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Shooting Quasar Dragon"">Shooting Quasar Dragon/Crystal Wing</a> ).

- Roughly 70% consistency start hand, as long as you able to Synchro into <a data-name=""Junk Speeder"">Junk Speeder and you can run combo from there.</a>

- 95% Win end board unless they play Lava Golem or Sphere Mode (Which is super rare for most decks). 3-7 negates (3 Handtrap/Trap from T.G Hyper Librarian draw and 1 from Majestic Mirage SS SMSD to reuse his effect) by the end of your turn.

CON:

- If <a data-name=""Junk Speeder"">Junk Speeder</a> effect gets negated, you are over and no possible come back unless you run a second <a data-name=""Junk Speeder"">Junk Speeder AND survive with one defense monster.</a>

- Super weak to handtrap/negate as every combo is super essential to bring out big gun

- While being quite consistent, dead hand is totally dead hand and all you can do is set a monster hoping they don't play Train OTK deck.

Uh, It's obviously pretty bad. I am in no way a good deck builder and I would heavily advise to change the deck to make it better or play a different one altogether. I also  wouldn't recommend building this anywhere, in master duel and especially not real life. DO NOT USE COMPETITIVELY. It will go horribly.

&nbsp;

<span>(CARD USES) </span>

-Short explanations / combos if needed

&nbsp;

Turbulence Fog counter to special smoke ball, then if you or turbulence survives into the next turn you can switch it to defense for the Smackdown boost to 3k.

Galaxy Serpent because no Normal Light Fairy monsters exist, Halq material.

Zera lets you add sanc for no battle damage. You can also use Zera while Mokey Mokey is on the field to destroy itself (No Sanctuary on field) to gain the Smackdown boost.

Burial from D.D for Eva Effect.

Swing and Wight since there is a lack of gy presence.

League of Nomenclature if your Smoke Ball or Mokey Mokey survives.

6 Prosperity Targets, The extra copies of spider, kuriboh, and almiraj can also be used for another pot if need be.

Halq for extra summons, Can also go into Wizard.

Spider to unbrick hands.

Wizard to double damage, or reset some of your damage from prosperity.

Goddess for removal.

Great for Advanced Players who can read the board and know the decks they are facing. In depth tutorial.,"This is a work in progress!

Quick introduction to me! My name is MoboFett, and I have been in and out of yu-gi-oh since I was ~6. My first deck was summoned skull and I fell in love with the deck, but eventually lost my cards. Around a 3 years ago my little brother had me get back into yu-gi-oh because my love for it when we were kids sparked his enjoyment for it. I struggled to find a deck I truly enjoyed and eventually found the Invoked archetype, and it quickly became a favorite. With a lot of testing and enjoyment from this deck, I then dug for means to make the deck compete with top tier decks and came up with the following. I hope to ever evolve this deck, and I hope this deck helps someone fall in love with the game,

This is a control deck with a lot of negation/destruction.

Generally you want to go first, but you can easily make this a 2nd turn deck.

Going first! You are looking to bring out some form of negate, and the strongest form of negation in this deck is Mechaba (This does not mean it is limited to just him.) The ideal starting hand includes Aleister the invoker, Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous, Invocation, Magical Meltdown, and Shaddoll Fusion. First bait out the hand traps with magical meltdown as this will only bring an Aleister to hand and prevent the negation of fusion summoning. If you notice they don't have hand traps then proceed to summon Aleister, and get another invocation ( you will appreciate this when you realize people will negate everything you do.) with Aleister, special summon  Artemis, use invocation to bring out Mechaba, then activate Eccclesia to special summon her to the field in defense postion and use her effect to search for dogmatika Punishment. You now 4 negates on the field (I'll explain momentarily.), and a free cannot be destroyed by battle with extra deck monsters. During your opponents turn you can then bully them with Mechaba, if they still try to do something use Dogmatika Punishment to destroy 1 of their cards, send N'tss to the grave and enjoy destroying one card on top of the punishment destruction, you can then use Fleurdelis as a hand trap to negate the effect of one face up monster your opponent controls. This deck typically will roll if the opponent does not understand your combos.

&nbsp;

Going 2nd is the same idea except you need to get maximus on field, to send psy-frame lor omega and N'tss to the GY and you have destruction and recycling with N'Tss. When I am more available I will extend this for more combos. I do not know how to add the tab that shows negates and boss monsters for decks as this is my first deck submitted."

This deck is built to set up easy OTK's.","First things first this is a go second deck, it can work if you go first but it isn't as fluid.

The main strategy of this deck revolves around Three Visits, hence its position as deck master, ideally you want to get <a data-name=""Ancient Warriors Saga - Three Visits"">Ancient Warriors Saga - Three Visits</a> out on your first turn then play one of your ancient warriors monsters. If you have <a data-name=""Ancient Warriors Saga - Masterful Sun Mou"">Ancient Warriors Saga - Masterful Sun Mou</a> in your hand then this should be the monster you play after Three visits.

There are two possible strategies depending on the variables stated above:

Normal hand - not containing Sun Mou

If you have Tenki in your hand then you can use it to draw Sun Mou, if not then continue as follows. Play Three visits then play an ancient warriors monster from your hand, this will activate Three visits which you can use to summon either Sun Mou or <a data-name=""Ancient Warriors Saga - Rebellious Lu Feng"">Ancient Warriors Saga - Rebellious Lu Feng. If you draw Sun Mou then see below, however, if you draw Lu Feng then he should be your main piece for the rest of the game.</a>

Sun Mou hand

Play Three visits then play Sun Mou this will start a chain here are the steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Use Sun Mou as the catalyst for Three Visits</li>
 	<li>Use three visits to add one of your special monsters to your hand these include:
<ul>
 	<li>Ambitious Cao De (Recommended, if not in hand)</li>
 	<li>Valiant Zhang De (Recommended, if not in hand)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Use Sun Mou's ability selecting Three Visits as the tribute</li>
 	<li>Use this ability to add Rebellious Lu Feng to your hand if not already, if you already have one in your hand then choose one from the list above.</li>
 	<li>Now you can activate the graveyard ability of Three Visits and use it to summon Cao De if you have and if not then Valiant Zhang De.</li>

This config heavily relies on Overload Fusion: the combos are easy to stun, but with a bunch of Overload Fusion (and Necro Fusion) the problem could be partially mitigated. You can also send the useless Cyberdark Dragon fusion ad material with Claw equipped to one of the three little dragons. This deck is heavily optimized for Cyberdark dragons: there is all what you need for summoning the big boy, and also handtraps to protect the combos.

Mostly, without Parallel eXceed, we cannot use Iblee and without Accesscode Talker, we cannot add her when we don't open with her or in the other case when we don't open with Cynet Codec.

I tested this deck 50 times. I was able to do the perfect combo 20 times. I was able to do my normal combo 21 times and I bricked 9 times. Out of those 9 bricks i was able to DPE and pass turn 5 times.

Going second:

Pray and use hand traps/ Dark ruler/ Droplet

&nbsp;

Deck can be somewhat versatile and is definitely fun. Lots of different openings that end the duel quickly. However, prone to handtraps and less to bricking.

Side (and main) deck suggestions are very welcome!

Happy dueling."

Set up your Doomking negate with the Zombie World package. Also use glow up bloom to add Voivode to hand then kaiju summon Voivode using 2 of their monsters when Sucker is active, spawning 2 of their monsters to your side of the field and  rank 8 into Zombie Vampire with 3 materials (then overlay AA-Zeus!)

The main goal with the deck is to take control of your opponents monsters that might annoy you and keep them out of their reach. The deck makes great use of graveyard effects and can combo like crazy.

This deck is completely BONKERS to be honest! The only problem I've had really is a very slight consistency issue but I'm always open to trying other cards in here. Possibly Allure of Darkness."

Once you are able to activate map (and usually reveal a Robina or Eglen, to be able to grab Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds without wasting a summon/search) and go into Empen, you are easily able to grab the Dreaming Town trap card and set up with a skill drain in Empen, and a near perfect floodgate with Stormwinds. The second Stormwinds is definitely a scum move, but for problem decks that can full combo after the barriers destruction, it might be necessary to bring the second Stormwinds to the field. You can use  the effect of Dreaming Town on their main phase (ideally after their normal summon) to grab Robina -&gt; Stormwinds,  to still further prevent them from making their plays possible. The deck has many fun combos to explore, and has infinite ways to get to the same board state. This deck is versatile, and at the ratios provided, I believe it has the lowest potential for a brick, and the highest potential to win. Remember. Deck thinning, is game winning."

An infamous deck from way back in the days of old. Appearing first in Strike of Neos as a cute little beatdown deck but had something unique about them, if one was to be destroyed by battle you can choose a different six samurai monster instead which gave the deck a fighting chance against the might of Gladiator Beasts, and Lightsworns at the time. This deck also gave birth to some of the most infamous cards out there in the form of Legendary Six Samurai Shi En which is a soft once per turn spell/trap negate meaning if you had two or three of this chad out you could do 3 negates and combo that with Naturia Beast and Barkion at the time and the deck became feared. The next cards being the ever so loop heavy love couple of Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai as well as Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho. The big enablers of the infinite bushido counter loop amassing almost infinite counters to abuse with Mizuho also being a soft once per turn allowing you to just keep reviving your Shinai or Kizan for field clearing or FTKs with Amazoness Archer or Cannon Soldier. The third being Legendary Six Samurai - Kizan which is just a free non once per turn special summon from hand giving you access to free field spam and letting you go into a ton of synchro, XYZ, and Link plays. The final card being the infamous and still hated to this day GATEWAY OF THE SIX which every single time a six samurai monster is normal or special summoned place two Bushido Counters on it which if you build up enough counters lets you make an unbeatable almost unbreakable monster floodgate board but enough gushing about this deck. Time to say what the main field you want is.

&nbsp;

The main end field you want for this deck is- Apolousa with 4 counters, two Shi Ens for two spell/trap negates, a Great Shogun Shien (I believe this card is amazing this format with Adventure and Despia running around and he has priority so Despia Players can now cry when they can't resolve their Branded in Red, Branded Opening, and Branded Fusion all in the same turn), a Naturia Beast because of Non Once Per Turn spell negation so you can laugh in the face of Despia and Adventure package players when they can't resolve their Rite of Amersur (I don't know how to spell it), Faithful Adventure and for Despia their Branded Fusion, Theater, Red and Opening. The last monster slot can be anything if you play your cards right. I typically like to have either Break Sword or Shadow Shien in the last slot. The ideal spells would be Gateway and 2 Dojo or at least 1 Dojo and bith have a good number of counters on them in case I want to push for game and the last spell being a Divine Sword Phoenix Blade just as an additional power up to a warrior I control. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION. Another ideal monster for the last monster zone can be Secret Six Samurai - Rihan just as a surprise summon and because it is a banish opponents monster contact fusion (also because I think it would be based as fuck to summon)

&nbsp;

In the end, my build is just I consider to be more negate heavy. Hope you find this enjoyable to read and are more informed."

( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=rWbMx7KpfJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=rWbMx7KpfJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )

What if I told you we could get nice things? What if I told you that these said nice things came in a form to be called one of the best structure decks since the pandemic? Well either we are truly in luck or we are just opted to not get set to the curb like we would've gotten as always. Alba Strike is the endgame of lore building, and competitive viability that US (the players) have at least tried to maintain in an age of darwinistic vitality. However for a $10 structure deck, it's veeeeerrry solid.

As usual, we are given at least 40 cards, but there is something interesting with this one. Besides <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance </a>and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> (which the latter of the two I did not play for this demostration), We are given 5 (Yes 5) powerful fusion monsters that actually do things. Also you have your familiar faces like <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdeis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdeis, the Knighted</a> and <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>. However what was unexpected was that they added pieces from Dragon Link in this Structure Deck: Mainly <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyvernburster"">White Dragon Wyvernburster</a>, and <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>. The support in this set that truly took this structure deck home however was the support for the ""Branded"" sub-archetype.

For one, we got the new fusion spell, <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> (which allows you to fusion summon a fusion monster using a ""Fallen of Albaz"" monster), and the new searcher <a data-name=""Springans Kitt"">Springans Kitt</a> (Which Special Summons herself if you control a Fusion monster listed as ""Fallen of Albaz"", then if successful can search out a ""Branded Spell/Trap that from your deck or that is Banished or in your GY). <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Mercourier"">Tri-Brigade Mercourier</a> is another new piece which acts as an archetype based negator, and if banished can search out <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or a monster with the name listed in its text. <a data-name=""Paradise Branded"">Paradise Branded </a>is basically just Magical Meltdown; but only activates it's search effects after you fusion summon your monster, and only with a ""Fallen of Albaz"", or a monster with the name in it's text (you still got that sweet anti-negate protection though, so that's nice).

As a sweet bonus, I mentioned earlier we get 5 powerful fusion monsters that were only expected to be released in core sets. First comes the original three of the lineup: that being Albion the Branded Dragon, Brigand the Glory Dragon, and Sprind the Irondash Dragon.

<ul>
 	<li>Always try to activate Exosister Vadis when your opp goes to move something from GY to hand/deck/field/remove from play.</li>
 	<li>Exosister Kaspitell/ZS - Utopic Sage can make a easy Number F0 - Utopic Future-&gt;Number F0: Utopic Draco Future.</li>
 	<li>If your stuck with Exosister Stella and Exosister Elis: Always try to bait out a negate with Exosister Stella first as if those are the only two you have you wont be able to get both activations of +800LP.</li>
 	<li>If your building this: you can pick any 3 of the Familiar's (Jigabyte/Nefarius/Ranryu/Inari) Just make sure you play 1 of each due to them only being able to have 1 of themselves on the field.</li>
</ul>
Combo for Draco Future:
Requires: ZS-Ascended sage + Any Exosister + Familiar/Exosister Pax/Exosister Elis
<ol>
 	<li>Special ZS-Ascended Sage.</li>
 	<li>Normal summon any Exosister.</li>
 	<li>Activate Exosister Pax search Exosister Elis [Note: Using Exosister Stella's effect may draw out a negate. Best to try Exosister Elis]</li>
 	<li>Special summon Exosister Elis.</li>
 	<li>Using ZS-Ascended sage and either Exosister XYZ summon ZS-Utopic Sage.</li>
 	<li>Search your deck for Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce using ZS-Ascended Sage. (Mostly to remove a possible dead draw)</li>
 	<li>Activate ZS-Utopic Sage to special summon ZS-Ascended Sage from deck.</li>
 	<li>Use the second ZS-Ascended Sage and the second Exosister to XYZ summon Kaspitell[If you want a Exosister monster search] or better yet Exosister Mikailis to banish one of your opponents cards from field or GY and a Exosister Spell/Trap search.</li>
 	<li>Activate your Exosister Mikalis and search a Exosister Spell/Trap.[Generally you want Exosister Vadis to threaten opp turn/set up for next turn]</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon Number F0: Utopic Future using ZS-Utopic Sage and Exosister Mikailis/Kaspitell.</li>

","You always want to go second with numeron decks.

The strategie is simple; first you summon <strong>numeron network </strong>on the filed, you can search this card with( <strong>numeron wall, planet pathfinder </strong>and <strong>terraforming)</strong> then special summon 4 numeron monsters from your extra deck. Then use <strong>memories of</strong> <strong>hope</strong>( if you have it in  your hand) to draw 4 cards.  Attack your opponent monster and you won. If your opponent is somehow still alive, summon one link monster( you can choose any link monsters depending on your situation) and end your turn. The best link monster to summon in most situation is
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess (  you can negate your opponent monsters effect 4 times.)</span></h4>
You can easily destroyed you opponent board  and get rid of their boss monsters with the <strong>kaijus, raigeki, lightning storm </strong>and <strong>harpie's feather</strong>.

You also have other cards like <strong>ash </strong>and <strong>infinite impermanence </strong>to interrupt your opponent plays. Also <strong>magical mallet </strong>for consistency.

<strong>card destruction </strong>you use it when your opponents has too many cards in their hand.

&nbsp;

Now when your opponent decided to go second. It the same procedure  as when you go second, you summon 4 numeron then you summon <strong>apollousa </strong>and negate your opponent monsters effect.

Let's go to some analysis:

<span><strong>Strengths</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</strong> is there to use. It is simply a card that can help you to quickly activate <strong>Astrograph Sorcerer</strong> effect, which means that you can add 1 card that was destroyed that turn. Moreover, you can get to draw another card. Especially, except for the draw effect of Electrumite, the others are not once per turn. You can simply recycle it with the support of <strong>Metalfoes Mithrilium</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Metalfoes Alkahest</strong> can steal one effect monster (they will be frustrated lol)</li>
 	<li>The effect of Metalfoes monster in your main deck can help you search all  Metalfoes spells and traps easily, and you will have more chance to fusion summon</li>
 	<li>Endymion and Mythical Beasts monsters can help <strong>Magicians' soul</strong> activate its effect</li>
 	<li><strong>Magical Abductor</strong> can help you search <strong>Magician's Soul</strong> or any pendulum monsters providing you can provide enough Spell counter for her</li>
 	<li><strong>Magicians' Soul</strong> can help you draw card(s) when you are brick, or you can send <strong>Metalfoes Combination</strong> and <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> to get some card advantages</li>
 	<li><strong>Super Polymerization</strong> can shut down your opponent's combo easily lol...</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Too dependent on starting hand</li>
 	<li>If you cannot summon<strong> Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</strong>... Game over</li>
 	<li>The average atk of this deck is not so good (main dmg from the piercing effect of <strong>Metalfoes Orichalc</strong> and <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Summary</span></strong>

You need to have practice to master a deck, and this deck will take you lots of time to do that because the combos depend on your hand and your thinking way.

<strong><em>Thanks for spending time reading and having a look at my deck. I welcome all suggestions from you guys.</em></strong>"

It's a fairly competent going second deck that can break through an opponent's first turn board and deal lethal damage on your first turn. The whole goal is to use your going second cards to pick the opponents field apart, summon Raviel or Hamon with the Sacred Beast engine, and use the Dangers to swarm the field and deal 8000 damage on your turn.

Now this is a going second deck, so in an ideal world you'll go second every time. I'll go over each card and some main combos and what to do if you're ever made to go first. Also your notice the small 10 card extra deck, this is exactly here to counter the Banquet Of Millions OTK whenever people get off that deck feel free to bring it up to 15 with whatever generic Links you like.
<h2>The Main Deck:</h2>
<strong>Chaos Summoning Beast</strong> - This card is how you get the Sacred Beasts out simple as that, this card is pretty easy to find and activate since it's effect tributes itself. Though it is very susceptible to Called By The Grave so keep that in mind. You can also banish this card from the graveyard to add Fallen Paradise to your hand, so this card is very important. Luckily it's super easy to search with the Sacred Beast cards. Finally do keep in mind this card's effects are all on a hard once per turn so if it get's negated, that's it.

<strong>Dark Beckoning Beast</strong> - This card finds whatever you need for your Sacred Beast combos, it's a great searcher and allows you to normal summon Chaos Summoning Beast once you have everything you need. Like with Chaos Summoning Beast this card is a hard once per turn and is pretty susceptible to interruption so keep that in mind.

<strong>Dark Summoning Beast</strong> - This card isn't super special, you can banish it from the graveyard to search a Sacred Beast and it can tribute itself to summon a Sacred Beast from your hand or the deck, but then you can't attack. It's really just useful for it's search effect or the rare occasion where you have to go first.

<strong>Raviel, Lord Of Phantasms</strong> - Your preferred win condition, you cheat it out with Chaos Summoning Beast and it hits really hard. It has an handy effect where you can tribute a monster you control to increase it's attack by that monsters original attack which helps you push for lethal. It also allows you to special summon a token when your opponent normal summons, but that rarely comes up. Also this monster has no inherent protection, so try not to have it on the field without Fallen Paradise as well or it won't last too long.

<strong>Hamon, Lord Of Striking Thunder</strong> - The back-up plan, you also cheat this card out like Raviel. It is able to burn your opponent for 1000 damage if it destroys a monster and sends it to the grave and that can help push for game. But usually Raviel is better at that. However, Hamon is good if your being made to go first and you can stick it on the field in defense with Fallen Paradise up. Then your opponent has to find a way to overcome it's 4000 defense with Fallen Paradise's protection since when this card is in defense your opponent can only target it with attacks. Also same as Raviel this it is very vulnerable without Fallen Paradise.

<strong>Danger!? Jackalope?</strong> - Pretty much all the Dangers are here for the same reason, they easily swarm the field for link plays and help you cycle through your deck quickly to find what you need. Jackalope's discard effect is really good with Raviel as you can summon Bigfoot or Thunderbird off it and turn the defense position Danger into attack points for Raviel.

<strong>Danger!? Tuschinoko?</strong> - Tuschinoko probably has the weakest discard effect besides Thunderbird but it still does guarantee a body for a link play or extra damage so it's better than nothing.

<strong>Danger! Nessie!</strong> - The searcher of the Dangers find whichever one you need in the situation you find yourself in.

<strong>Danger! Thunderbird!</strong> - Probably the weakest discard effect unless your facing exactly Eldlich then it can help clear out their backrow or force them to activate it prematurely. Other than that it's a big body to tribute for Raviel.

<strong>Danger! Bigfoot</strong> - Definitely the Danger you want to see the most, a big body for closing out games and a pretty good effect on discard. Popping a face up card is always nice.

<strong>Kaijus</strong> -Not going to give each Kaiju their own entry they all have the same purpose. They're here to blow up the opponent's board with Interrupted Kaiju slumber or get annoying boss monsters off your opponents field on their own. They also all have big bodies for Raviel's effect. Keep in mind there are only 4 in the deck so you don't really want to draw too many or search them off of slumber's effect or you'll turn slumber off.

<strong>Maxx ""C</strong>"" - The necessary evil of Master Duel right now. It's the only hand trap I play in the deck and I shouldn't need to say why. Make your opponent chose between giving you a bunch of cards and you blow them out or ending their turn early and you blow them out. I hope this card get's banned soon, and once it's done I'd probably replace it with Ash Blossom.

<strong>Fallen Paradise</strong> - This field spell is crazy. Gives all the Sacred Beast targeting and destruction protection limiting your opponents options to get rid of them. Then once per turn if you control a Sacred Beast you can just draw 2 Cards, which will definitely help you OTK your opponent.

<strong>Opening Of The Spirit Gates</strong> - This is a searcher just like Dark Beckoning Beast, lets you find whatever Sacred Beast combo piece you need when you activate it. However it has some other neat effects. You can discard a card to special summon a 0 attack fiend from the graveyard, combos really well with Chaos and Dark Summon Beasts. Then if you control a Sacred Beast you can add a continuous spell from the graveyard to the hand, which really only let's you recycle other copies of it and rarely comes up.

<strong>Allure Of Darkness</strong> - Let's you draw cards and you play lots of dark monsters. Pretty good card in this deck.

<strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> - Dark Hole that let's you get a Kaiju on both your field and your opponents. Always give them Gameciel. You can also banish it from the graveyard to search a Kaiju, but you can't do that the turn you use this card so it rarely comes up.

<strong>Lightning Storm</strong> - Great going second card for blowing up all your opponent's monsters or their backrow, whichever is going to be a problem. Pretty self explanatory choice.

<strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> - This is a newer card in the deck, but it's really here because of exactly Rhongomyniad. Otherwise it's just helpful for negating really annoying monster effects, halving attack points, and setting up your graveyard.
<h2>The Extra Deck:</h2>
<strong>Linkuriboh</strong> - It's basically here to let you send Chaos Summoing Beast to the graveyard for whatever reason. Otherwise it's on field effect can be useful in you find yourself in a pinch.

<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> - An easy way to send Dark Beckoning Beast to the Graveyard, with a decent on field effect as well.

<strong>Knightmare Cerberus</strong> - Let's you pick off special summoned monsters in your opponent's main monster zone.

<strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> - Let's you pick off spell and traps.

<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> - This card is really for when you're going first or your opponent stopped your Sacred Beast plays. Set it up with enough Material to make an Accesscode on your opponents turn and hope for the best.

<strong>Barricadeborg Blocker</strong> - Let's your recycle Spirit Gates or Fallen Paradise if they get destroyed.

<strong>Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion</strong> - This card helps you when you get a really bad starting hand. Let's you just mill whatever you need to the grave. Get a Chaos Summoning Beast so you can summon it with Gates, or banish to find Fallen Paradise. Or send Dark Summoning to find a Sacred Beast. Just hope you don't get unlucky with the random mills.

<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> - Just get rid of one of anything your opponent has you don't like. And a great card to make Accesscode with.

<strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> - If all else fails this card can win games by itself and it's really easy to make with all the swarming potential you have. Gives it self a big attack boost and can pop cards on the opponent's field. This is definitely Plan C but sometimes you get put in a position where this is your only win condition.

<strong>Underworld Goddess Of The Closed World</strong> - A good card for stealing cards on your opponents field, a bit harder to use than a Kaiju but can definitely catch opponents off guard. And it's on field effects can win you games against certain decks.
<h2>The Ideal Starting Hand:</h2>
In a perfect world you always go second and you want to open like this. At least 1 of either of Dark Beckoning or Spirit Gates, At least one of Chaos Summoning, Dark Summoning, or a Sacred Beast. And some Dangers or other cards to break your opponent's board. Let's go over some combos:
Let's say your starting hand is:

Dark Beckoning
Chaos Summoning
Bigfoot
Kaiju Slumber
Jackalope
Maxx ""C""

Once your turn comes probably start with Kaiju Slumber to wipe the board and get some Kaijus on the field.  Summon Dark Beckoning and search Spirit Gates. Activate Spirit Gates and search your preferred Sacred Beast. Then use Dark Beckoning's effect to summon Chaos Summoning. Then banish from the graveyard Chaos Summoning to search Fallen Paradise. Activate Fallen Paradise and draw 2 cards then just use your Dangers to amass enough presence and make links you want to win the game.

Now let's say your starting hand is:

Dark Beckoning
Tuschinoko
Bigfoot
Kaiju Slumber
Jackalope
Maxx ""C""

Just Dark Beckoning isn't ideal but with Curious you can still go full combo. Summon Beckoning to find Spirit Gates and use Spirit Gates to find a Sacred Beast. Then use your Dangers to get enough Material for Curious and mill Chaos summoning to the Graveyard. Then you can use Spirit Gates to discard a card from your hand to get Chaos Summoning on the field and summon a Sacred Beast, then banish it for Fallen Paradise and push for game.

These Scenarios assume you never used your Maxx ""C"" but this is just some of the combos you can do in the deck. I definitely recommend just playing some games with the deck, there's a lot of combos you can do to win the game really quickly.
<h2>Going First:</h2>
If your opponent makes you go first then it's time to cry lol, but in all seriousness this deck isn't great going first. The best you can really do is try and stick Hamon in defense with Fallen Paradise up and/or I:P with enough material for an Accesscode or Unicorn. There's just not many options for a strong board going first so avoid it if at all possible.
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Well that's the deck, I'd love any advice or tweaks I could make to it and I'm completely open to answering any questions you might have about the deck. You can follow me on Twitch at: <a>https://www.twitch.tv/sirzero14</a> to see me play this and other decks in my arsenal."
