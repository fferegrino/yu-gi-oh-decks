Going 1st your set up board can vary from an Abyss Dweller + True King of all Calamities + El Shaddoll Winda to fewer combinations of them. The profile is also very budget focussed. (if playing on a budget isn't a thing for you, pure Dinosaur would be the going 2nd Deck to look after)  <strong>Card ratios</strong>  <em>Monsters:</em> 3 Fluffal Bear because it starts your draw engine (mostly based on Toy Vendor) and can get you a Poly back (which doesn't come up that seldom because I only play 2 copies);  1 Fluffal Penguin because you can't always use it as Fusion Material (often you use Fluffal Cat in order to get your Poly back); 1 Fluffal Cat because it more ore less duplicates your Poly in a way; 3 Fluffal Dog and 1 Fluffal Dolphin (or 2 Fluffal Dog 2 Fluffal Dolphin) this ratio is debateable because Dolphin+ Foolish Burial Goods + any Fluffal starts your Draw engine (and might get you a Poly back to the deck) but Fluffal Dog + Fluffal Bear also starts your draw engine; 1 Fluffal Wings because you only use the draw effect and want to send it to your graveyard in any way rather than having it in your starting hand; 1 Fluffal Owl because space is limited and King of the Swamp searches Poly without being summoned; 2 Edge Imp Chain because the effect is very good but only in combination with other cards ( f.e. when you search it with Frightfur Patchwork and got a Fluffal you insantly have access to the Frightfur part of your Extra Deck, you might also play 3 though); 1 Edge Imp Sabres because it is easily searchable and the effect comes up very seldom; 1 of Shaddoll Beast/ Dragon/ Hedgehog and Naelshaddoll Ariel for drawing/ hitting backrow/ searching a Shaddoll to discard or fuison with/ clearing your opponents graveyard (can't be triggered by Toy Vendor/ Super Poly or other cards that discard for cost!); 2 King of the Swamp for searching your Poly (or to replace Edge Imp Sabres) you might also replace it with 1 additional Poly and 1 additional Edge Imp Chain ( drawing the stated card is better than searching it if you are likely to face negation); 1 Dinowrestler Pankratops as it can easily force out negations going 2nd  <em>Spells: </em>3 Frightfur Patchwork because it's an insane searcher; 3 Foolish Burial Goods because it can send Toy Vendor (and therefore search) and also Frightfur Repair (if you absolutely need a Edge Imp/ Fluffal specialed from your hand); 2 Polymerization becaused it can be searched and recycled ( 3 also would be an option if you are facing a lot of negation against your search); 1 Frightfur Fusion because it is a searchable extender but you don't want it in your opening hand; 2 Toy Vendor because you want to send it to the GY or set it with Fluffal Bear but not draw it (1 would be too less copies, 3 use too much Main Deck space in my opinion); 1 Frightfur Repair as you want to send it with Frightfur Cruel Whale but not draw it ( it's a good extender but not more as that); 3 Shaddoll Fusion because it generates a lot of advantage going 2nd  if you are facing an opponent using the Extra Deck (if not you rather side out all copies of this card); 3 Super Polymerization because it's a cheap and reliable going 2nd card ( can only be stopped by an Extra Deck or Spell Card lock, you might also keep it in the Side Deck and replace it with 2 Dark Hole 1 Raigeki as these have broader ways of usage but are easily negated) and also triggers a discarded Toy Vendor etc. ; 1 Mind Control because it's often a must negate going 2nd  <em>Extra Deck:</em> 1 True King of all Calamities as going 1st option (Fluffal Dog + Frightfur Patchwork get you there in 4 summons if uninterrupted); Abyss Dweller as going 1st option; 1 Predaplant Dragostapelia/ Starving Venom Fusion Dragon/ Mudragon of the Swamp for your Super Poly targets; 1 El Shaddoll Shekhinaga/ Construct/ Winda for: negation/untargeted destruction an Fluffal Wings in the graveyard/ floodgate and also filling your graveyard; 1 Cross-Sheep ( this spot is debateable but I like it for linking off a Mind Control target/ getting into Abyss Dweller); 1 Frightfur Kraken/ Sabre-Tooth/ Tiger/ Wolf for breaking boards and OTKing  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck and noteable mentions</strong>  The side deck is more an idea of cards that can be good siding in or even in the Main Deck e.g. El Shaddoll Apkallone + Extra-Foolish Burial can search El Shaddoll Fusion ( here I also included expensive cards but side decks quickly change from format to format). Your real Side Deck should definitely contain: cards against backrow oriented Decks (Twin Twister, Anti-Spell-Fragrance); cards against heavy combo Decks (Dark Ruler no more, Nibiru); cards to side in if you are likely to be forced to go 1st ( Floodgates, Extenders);(I put Apollousa in here because it can replace Calamities if it gets banned in the future); replacing Mudragon of the Swamp with Borreload Dragon might make sense for facing sticky monsters with high protection capabilities; If you have the PSY-Frame package in your Main or Side Deck you should probably play PSY-Framelord Lamda  <strong>General discussion and  strategies</strong>  <em>Pros:</em> The deck can play through 1 hand Trap mostly and has a lot of easy accessable removal options; The Fluffal draw engine can often ''unbrick'' your hand and draw into your Side Deck cards in game 2 and 3; The deck leaves a lot of Main deck space to be sided out because the Shaddoll half of the deck is not mandatory (e.g. if you are facing an opponent who doesn't use the Exra Deck at all you are better off taking out your 7 card Shaddoll engine and replacing it with Side Deck equalizers); the deck can also bait negations without committing to a normal or special summon (f.e. Toy Vendor or Frightfur Patchwork search effect, going 2nd blow out cards); Chain Blocking is often an option in order to assure your important effects to go through; going 1st you can set up boards in under 5 summons (which means you don't have to fear Nibiru, the Primal Being)  <em>Cons: </em>The deck is very susceptible to Hand Traps ( searches a lot and uses on-field monster effects); The deck highly Extra Deck and Graveyard reliant; the Shaddoll half of the deck only works against Extra Deck strategies; the deck's intrinsic removal options are mostly targeting and destructing ( Frightfur Cruel Whale is only destructing); The deck relies on its Spell Cards to go through; as many cards can be sided out (and have to in certain match-ups) a 15 card Side Deck is not capable of fitting all kind of cards you might need; the deck can brick going 1st (this rarely happens going 2nd though, apart of not drawing blow-out cards)  <strong>Deck building</strong>  As we now have stated strenghts and weaknesses of the deck, we have to find a way to minimize the weaknesses while not cutting too much of its strenghts.  Going 1st Hand Traps put a lot of pressure on this deck (especially Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Droll &amp; Lock Bird), which can be decreased by playing Called by the Grave + 3 PSY-Framegear Gamma + the 1 PSY-Frame Driver (as you can generate a lot of advantage before committing to a summon Gamma will be live). Also activating Gamma and then linking off the Driver with another monster into Lamda lets you search another copy of Gamma in the End Phase (which you are now free to activate even with monsters on board); Infinite Impermanence stays a card you have to play around --&gt;this package is a Side Deck option for both going 1st and 2nd  As non-target removal I would recommend to play Borreload Dragon (you have to play Cross-Sheep for Link-Climbing reasons, if you decide to go this route), either Mudragon of the Swamp or Predaplant Dragostapelia should be exchanged.  As the deck is Spell Card reliant, big threats are cards like: Secret Village of the Spellcasters, Imperial Order or mono Spell negates. Against the Floodgates side in 3 Evenly Matched (very versatile card in general) and maybe 1 Red Reboot (also a killer against trap-based backrow decks). Mono negates can be overrolled by simply playing more board wipers ( 2 Dark Hole 1 Raigeki instead of 3 Super Polymerization).  One might also play Super Polymerization in he Side Deck with Starving Venom Fusion Dragon as it's only target in order to fit in Cross-Sheep + Borreload Dragon + PSY-Framelord Lamda (or maybe even replace Super Poly with Dark Ruler no More and gain another free Extra Deck spot); playing Frightfur Wolf is also debateable, but it's synergy with Frightfur Cruel Whale to bump it up to 3000 ATK speaks for holding an Extra Deck slot for it  &nbsp;"

Attempt to OTK the following turn by utilizing the Noble Knight boss monsters and out-resource your opponent through Isolde and Noble Knight Brother's effects. 60 cards allows for multiple uses of Isolde and prevents the deck from struggling in the late game.

The deck can flex between board-building and grinding with Snow.  Pros: - Has a very high turn 1 ceiling for board-building - Fairy Tail Snow can shut down many decks - Very flexible Extra Deck toolbox gives a good matchup spread  Cons: - The ceiling of the deck is facilitated by a large number of cards you don't ever really want to draw - A lot of the deck's power can often be reliant on random mills, dropping consistency - Since the boards don't really put up negations, aggro decks can often break your board going 2nd with the right hand"

Pros: - Able to put up multiple negates with ease - Can OTK very easily, even if your board gets broken - Wide variety of different boards to address different matchups (Dweller, Rafflesia, or Vortex to name a few)  Cons: - If your scales get destroyed, many hands can't properly recover - The lack of Links means you can't make explosive pend summon comebacks - You do run a fair amount of bricks and sometimes you just open unplayable hands."

Anyway there is still no end, with that cards on the field, you cold be able to bring strong monster like Darkfluid or Avramax  3 cards with Lightning Strom, the reason because the deck only had 1 continous trap card, Mathmech Induction that could be easily to remove it from the field when you control Mathmech.  2 or 3 kaiju, you know that's how usually used to bring out annoying monster from opponent field, also that's good to to tribute def monster because Mathmech need to attack a monster in attack mode.  SIDE DECK : you can switch game play from your match game , that's make your opponent will unexpected this because it could be possible your opponent prepare to anticipate your game prevent for summoning Avramax or Darkfluid, and then there is  Crystron Halqifbrax, T.G. Librarian,  Formula Synchro, will bring Quasar the monster that always makes people fear, is easy to make that play with this deck  Magical Mid Breaker, you now that cards good for protecting your monsters from being targetted or destroyed by card effect, that card is for purpose to make Final sigma Mathmech boss monster with lv 12 easily to come out, becuase the synchro materials is being protected  3 nibiru, Yeah i hates to when people try to flooding with toon of negates monsters  i am forgot with counter trap in main deck, that is Red reboot, yeah that card can stop from annoying deck like Altergay and Eldich for a moment, and then hit them with one turn kill by Final Sigma  i guaranted if you know how to play with this deck, you even can take down an annoying monster like Dragun"

Also, I use Lib to set World legacy's heart as to get more resources in the hand for either to be put back using skulldread(so I can keep more of the cards I drew off of skull dread) or targets to be special summoned off of the links. Thus I can spam more skull dreads and get appolusa on the field. Overall this is a really fun deck, it is just kind of inconsistent, hence why  I put in as much searching and drawing cards as I could. This is also why I put in so many special summoning cards as this deck is essentially skull dread spam, otherwise, it has no chance. Feel free to send me any comments on the deck!

Not much has changed, still running the Garden Rose Maiden through Apollousa route. It's nice, since it makes Apollo early in the turn, and you can play to your whole board with just one tuner extender. I'm back on a second Striker Dragon, since it helps when playing through interruptions. The nice thing about Dragon link is you can abuse all the broken stuff in the format, Linkross, Halq, Dragoon even, maybe even Rusty, but you can also just play through the old combo routes effectively and make similar powerful boards, even if those get stopped. I still think Dragoon puts it up to another level - you're in a 3 hand trap situation a lot of the time, and even if you have them, and the right ones, and time them right, you still have to play on with way fewer cards in the hand, and often through a Dragoon. It's the best link 2, and since the deck is inclined to play more than 40 cards the risk of bricking isn't so bad - besides, if you see the fusion, you don't make Dragoon, or you just play the fusion.  The hawtnezz in this deck is the Artifact engine. Lancea is okay right now, good enough to main with the engine, but the real goal here is to set up Tracer alongside Unchained Abomination in your normal combos to pop Scythe on their turn (Rokket Tracer pops somethings, triggers A-Bomb, A-Bomb pops Scythe).  You can only run 1 of the bricks if you want to, but they're way less bricky at 2 since you can just use them in normal combos. I wouldn't run a 40 card deck for Rokkets anymore, personally. I understand why people want the best possible odds of seeing their important cards, but you can often actually improve your odds of seeing a TYPE of card but running multiples of the TYPE of card in a larger deck. In Rokkets in particular, you have so many amazing extenders you want to be able to abuse, and you want the highest possibility of seeing those extenders as possible - yes, you see your one card combo less often, but you combo off just as often, and through interruptions more often. It puts a strain on the hand trap line, only the best of the best here.  In terms of the side deck, I decided to run obligatory back-row removal and hand traps, to help more effectively tailor against the combo decks at the front of the meta. Token Collector is here mostly for Infernoble, but is good against virtually any dedicated Linkross/Auroradon combo deck, and so it has fringe applications. Effect Veiler is here for Verte Anaconda, vs Dragoon decks, and also to cut Triple Tactics going second or Lancea against bad matchups. Ghost Ogre is here because it is really effective against Lost World in particular. It has niche uses, and is great against Field Spells in general, and you can bump up your hand traps in the mirror with it, because it is really good against Romulus most of the time.  Added Tempest into the deck. You need a good target to send with Dragon Ravine and still extend into Verte Anaconda in certain multiple hand trap situations, especially with Droll and Nibiru heavy in the meta right now.  Cut Tempest. It doesn't do it's job well enough. I also cut Dragoon, although that's more to test the deck without it, and improve the hand trap game. This means 1 fewer interruption you can play through, but the combo is essentially the same, and now there's room for Borrelsword, who is situationally useful in combos and under Guarddragons, and gives the deck an alternative for going second to Dragoon. I do like having more space for hand traps, I feel pretty solid on this line-up, for the meta."

After this you will end up with 2 lv 5 water monsters (1 being a tuner) that can go into Needlefiber (or ultimaya if on a budget).  You really want to normal summon Deep sea diva or go into Neptabyss some how  There is also the synchron engine which works great with the low lv water monsters as well as the frog engine for back up plays (easy lv 4 and 5 synchro plays)  Quite customizable (don't want to draw lappis, Neptabyss, or Gagigobyte so I recomend playing around 45 cards)  The main win conditions are Herald of the Arc Light (easy 2 make with all the lv 2s) and whatever you can make off of Needlefiber or Ultimaya  Junk Synchron works great in the deck and can easily go into lv 5 synchros  I play the nemeses engine to return all the banished monsters from Ronin, Aria, or Aqua Spirit"

I've made another weird deck. Today, we have Marincess' with a Traptrix engine. I know, that sounds wild; i'll elaborate as we go on. </span><span>First of all, for the deck, we have the basic Marincess combo pieces. Nothing out of the ordinary, you just normal one and then activate some effects to special out the others. Although, here's where this deck differs; we have a small Traptrix engine. With Bottomless Trap Hole and Trap Hole Nightmare both at 3 in the deck, you have a strong backrow to stop the opponent's plays. You also have Myrmeleo to search out traps and pop backrow, Genlisea to help build backrow (note you'll most likely be using her in turn 3, after using a trap hole and sending it to the graveyard), and Mantis to search out the rest. </span><span>We also have Marincess Battle Ocean, for the Marincess'. We now go into the extra deck. We have Sera, in case you want to do a bit more with the traps, but that's not the focus. You'll want to start using the Traptrix and Marincess' to link climb, and go into Great Bubble Reef. once you have Great Bubble Reef, you'll want to banish cards for the draw and attack gain, and go in for an OTK. </span><span>Note: You'll want to go first, to set up your traps and such. As always, this is one of my first decks here, so any feedback is appreciated. Have a good day!</span>"

The ""Gogogos"" aim, just like the rest of the ""Onomato""-related archetypes, to bring out Xyz monsters and work with their effects and often use the ""Utopia"" cards as their boss monster or game ending options.</p> <p>In terms of classic ""Gogogo"" cards, I run one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Goram"">Gogogo Goram</a>"" (solid beater and a slow ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" in monster form), one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Giant"">Gogogo Giant</a>"" (revives ""Gogogo"" monsters upon being Normal Summoned), one ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Gigas"">Gogogo Gigas</a>"" (self-reviving monster options which does cost your Battle Phase and is therefore most useful going first), two ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Aristera &amp; Dexia"">Gogogo Aristera &amp; Dexia</a>"" (defensive option with an effect that can potentially take care of big beaters on the opposing board) and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Gogogo Golem - Golden Form"">Gogogo Golem - Golden Form</a>"" (potentially sizeable stat block with in-built monster effect negation). There are also quite a few ""Onomato"" cards in the deck which are very helpful in terms of consistency and monster swarming. Those options are two ""<a data-name=""Dodododwarf Gogogoglove"">Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</a>"", two ""<a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"", which all have various effects allowing Special summoning from the hand or reviving either themselves or other monsters from the graveyard and therefore fetch a lot of usable monsters for Xyz summons. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Onomatopaira"">Onomatopaira</a>"" not only help setting up the graveyard but also fetch the right combination of cards, while I also added one copy of ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" for the sole reason of searching for either ""<a data-name=""Utopic Onomatopoeia"">Utopic Onomatopoeia</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"".</p> <p>Other archetype that are part of the deck include a small ""Koa'ki Meiru"" engine, with mainly ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"" as a solid Special summon since it triggers upon losing any Rock monster, while one copy of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Overload"">Koa'ki Meiru Overload</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Wall"">Koa'ki Meiru Wall</a>"" serve as disruption and can be easily summoned with ""<a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>"". The added ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" can give destruction protection to your ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters, but they are mostly there to fetch copies of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"" for the summon effect (which in turn also searches ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters). Aside from that I decided to run a small and inexpensive ""Adamancipator"" engine, with two copies each of ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a>"", which further help accrue Xyz-able monsters onto the field.</p> <p>The rest of the Main Deck really only features more support cards to make the deck run a little smoother. One copy of both ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Drought"">Barrier Statue of the Drought</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a>"" are good targets to summon via ""<a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>"" when going first and are also solid options to search and go into via your Normal Summon, since there are situation in which the Special summon block will hurt the opponent more than you. ""<a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a>"" is there as setup and as a play-enabler, ""<a data-name=""Block Golem"">Block Golem</a>"" is more of a niche option, but will transfer itself into exactly enough materials to start a Xyz summon and ""<a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>"" can revive itself with relative ease, but can only be used for Link summons due to its level. One copy of both ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" seemed pretty much mandatory to me in the deck and are options you can play if the removal cards in the Extra Deck cannot be used. ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" is more graveyard setup while ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is the obvious choice in terms of monster revival.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features a number of options to work with and is the main focus of the deck. ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" is solid backrow removal, ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" is non-destruction removal, ""<a data-name=""Diagusto Emeral"">Diagusto Emeral</a>"" is a card draw option and ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can be used to inflict the last tick of damage. The aforementioned ""Utopia"" engine comes in form of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"", which can be used to summon either ""<a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>"" (for a 5000 ATK beater against monsters) or ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" (for a 10000 ATK beater with the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>"" in the main deck, but which I only included once due to consistency reasons for the rest of the deck). So far, there is nothing out of the ordinary and most players probably already knew of those cards prior to reading this section. ""<a data-name=""Number 55: Gogogo Goliath"">Number 55: Gogogo Goliath</a>"" might be less familiar and can serve as a DEF booster and recurrence tool, but mostly finds a way onto the board because it is a ""Gogogo"" monster and therefore triggers certain cards; ""<a data-name=""Gagagaga Magician"">Gagagaga Magician</a>"" serves a similar purpose, but can revive previously used ""Utopia"" monsters for overlays and as 2500 ATK beaters. ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" is the Rock type searcher and therefore a very important tool of the deck. Lastly, the Link monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" both help getting cards upon being destroyed and both have solid effects that might come in handy during your turn (""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" being less useful with her revive effect, but ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" is a very solid tool since it provides solid stat boosts to pretty much everything on your side of the field).</p> <p>The ""Gogogos"" as a deck on their own really aged rather poorly, which is why I had to include so many other options. Nonetheless, if you want to play a deck that is capable of spamming Xyz monsters in a more Casual environment, I urge you to give the rocky monsters a go. Furthermore, if you want more information about the ""Gogogos"" and cards I did not feature in this deck list (or other archetypes for that matter), feel free to visit my blog under this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/archetype-analysis-gogogo/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/archetype-analysis-gogogo/</a></p>"

So what if we'll build a deck that focuses on kaiju's strong point and enforcing it's weak point with control cards. At first glance this deck does not look like it will be able to compete with today's meta, but trust me it'll surely make your opponent be scared of setting up his board since it will just get destroyed. Most of the cards in this deck are power cards, as it can change the pace of the game with just one card, what more if you'll play multiple copies of it?  This deck doesn't really have a combo and from the look of the card you'll know what it can do. So in order to utilize it more you need to study your opponent's deck in advance, that way. As you can see this can go either first or second turn depending on your opponent, but most of the time you'll want to go 1st to maximize i<em>nspector boarder</em>.  Side Deck Cards Purposes: <ul>  	<li><em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em> - Pretty good to side against combo decks like HERO, Infernoble, etc.</li>  	<li><em>Harpie's Feather Duster</em> - use this against backrow decks then they'll concede.</li>  	<li><em>Twin Twister</em> - same with the <em>harpie's feather duster</em> but they'll still continue the game.</li>  	<li><em>Mystic Mine</em> - Good for stopping your opponent while you gather resources.</li>  	<li><em>Super Polymerization</em> - OP board breaker!!!!</li>  	<li><em>Dimensional Barrier</em> - Probably the most OP side as of now, can literally make your opponent not play in their turn.</li>  	<li><em>Imperial Order</em> - Good against spell reliant decks like sky striker, HERO, etc.</li>  	<li><em>Soul Drain</em> - Since GY reliant deck is still a thing, use this so they can't play.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Things to remember: <ul>  	<li>I know <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> is a thing but with this deck, it's just an another monster to be tributed.</li>  	<li>Don't force to end the game quickly if you don't have enough resources, remember this a control deck.</li>  	<li>Use <em>fairy tail luna</em>'s effect on your opponent's one of monsters (monsters that only have one copy in their deck/extra deck)</li>  	<li>ALWAYS CHECK YOUR RESOURCES</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Your primary goal is to get 2 monsters on turn 1 and then link into Isolde grabbing Honest Neos, then binning Phoenix Blade to bring out Disk Commander and linking again into Anaconda for Fusion Destiny. You can also mix it up with Cross-Sheep, Mask Change, etc.  <strong>D-Hero package</strong>:  Plasma - Mainly a target for D-Draw, but his ability comes in handy and he's quite easy to summon in this deck.  Malicious - Your staple D-Hero. Enables all your strongest plays.  Celestial - Mainly fodder for D-Draw and Fusion Destiny, but you will be very thankful when you need either of his effects.  Drilldark - A great enabler for link summons.  Drawhand - A reasonable combo with Mask Change. You can chain Mask Change to his summon ability to swap into Dark Law and make your opponent banish a random card. You can also summon him off of Dominance getting merc'd at EOT from Fusion Destiny to get the card draw before your opponent. Lots of tricks with this fella, don't underestimate him.  Disk Commander - A level 1 to retrieve with Isolde and a great target for Cross-Sheep and Dominance.  Dark Angel - A backup level 1 for Isolde with a reasonable ability out of the grave. Pair him with Allure, D-Draw, or Drawhand to retrieve your card immediately.  <strong>The rest</strong>:  Honest Neos - Your best Isolde target since you don't need to play him to use him and he helps protect Dark Law.  Stratos - We use his S/T clear effect almost as much as his recruit effect in here, surprisingly. Often our best Cross-Sheep target if Disco isn't available.  Shadow Mist - Turns Foolish into a recruit and turns A Hero Lives into a copy of Mask Change. Also pitches to Allure. A fine role-players. It's just too bad it's not a D-Hero.  Spell Striker - An oft-forgotten tech from days passed, this little guy is great as a ROTA target to help build your link summons.  Ash Blossom - Best hand trap.  PSZ - We don't play synchros, but he still fills an important role by putting things back into the deck (*cough* Malicious *cough*) and by enabling an easy link or Plasma.  <strong>Spells</strong>:  Allure &amp; D-Draw - Our filter. Staple cards and one of the best reasons to run the D-Hero package. Just try not to get your D-Draw Ash'd!  A Hero Lives - Excellent enabler for the deck, grabbing either Stratos for a recruit or Shadow Mist for Mask Change, and then allowing a normal summon follow up into a link.  Fusion Destiny - Our primary Predeplant target.  Pot of Avarice - The deck fills it's GY so fast that I'd be hard-pressed not to include this. One of the more frequent Dark Angel targets.  Mask Change - Insane synergy with the deck. Dark Law is an absurd card and having access to it is one of this decks biggest strengths. Also combos with Cross-Sheep.  Mask Change II - I wanted more Mask Change!  Super Poly - Great Predeplant target and also enables more fusion for us.  Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade - The best Isolde target since you can rebuy it to get a free card! Also our primary enabler for Dystopia. Linking Isolde into Anaconda for Dystopia is a great way to swing board advantage in your favor.  ROTA, Foolish, Reborn, Impert - Staples.  <strong>Extra deck</strong>:  Dominance - Our primary target for Fusion Destiny. Lets us set up our GY heavily and mess with what our opponent draws, as well as giving us an insane board presence to OTK with after he dies.  Dystopia - A backup Fusion Destiny target and a frequent Super Poly target.  Dangerous - Tertiary fusion target. More of an enabler than a closer.  Dark Law - The GOAT  Divine Wind - Gives us a Mask target for Stratos, and a pretty good card in it's own right.  Anki - Masked Change II target for Malicious and Dark Law, plus a good closer (especially with Honest Neos!)  Fusion Dragon &amp; Mud Dragon - Super Poly enablers.  Borrelsword - OTK machine.  Cerberus - Utility slot, can be whatever you like.  Cross Crusader - Rarely needed, but extremely useful for getting your weaker hands off the ground.

Using Avramax and Quantum will make the opponent unable to select a target to attack. Add the summon of Avramax using I:P, and now it cannot be destroyed by card effects. With the Addition of Gatchiri on board (Protects EACH cyberse monster from 1 card destruction per turn), or in sent from field to grave (Target 1 monster you control and it is unaffected by opponents card effects until the end of opponents turn), it gives the board extra resistance. Optimally the end board would be: A) Avramax + Quantum + Gatchiri + I:P + Light Dragon/ I:P +Gatchiri Make Fire Phoenix to protect another piece using Gatchiri. B) Avramax/ Summoned using I:P + Quantum + Light Dragon +Gatchiri. In this option you can also use Gatchiri in the summon of Avramax to protect your Quantum or Light Dragon for the turn.  Going Second; my goal with this deck now changes to board wiping. It has multiple tools to remove cards like Wind Pegasus, Light Dragon, Accesscode Talker and Earth Golem. There are also means of causing effect damage using Fire Phoenix and Gussari. Beatsticks can be Gussari, Avramax, Quantum, Arrival and Accesscode Talker. The end boards can go many different ways because of the various abilities you have at your disposal to remove various cards. The main thing to know going second are your methods to building up. Once you get to Dark Templar whatever you have created just fuels the board. Its getting to Dark Templar that is the most effort. Fighting through negations is tough now with Called By The Grave @1. To compensate, recognize the interactions between Balancer Lord and Cynet Mining. Balancer Lord gets you a special summon from hand upon banishment whilst Backdoor will banish and add to your hand a card with lower attack than the card you banished. If BL is your target, you can add anything in your deck to your hand except for Gussari and Parallel Exceed. This interaction is easy to get any starter/extender to your hand/field whilst also dodging a baited Infinite Impermanence/Effect Veiler. As for the lack of hand traps, this deck does need its extenders to play comfortably. However, I have been considering to drop Gussari and make it a 43 card deck with 3x Sauravis/Effect Veilers (Or rather space for hand traps in general). Something will need to change once Called By The Grave is banned however because Forbidden Droplet and Crossout Designator do not fit too well in this profile.  If there are any @Ignister Duelists out there that have tips for their hand trap choices please lmk! Recommendations are also appreciated!  Also, I didn't speak much on the Side Deck because it really does depend on whatever the venue is and what the most popular decks are at the time :)"

Naturia has always been one of my favorite archetypes, however Konami doesn't seem to share my love of them. The last time they received any direct support was in The New Challengers all the way back in 2014. However, with the release of the new Rose cards, the archetype not only receives a consistency boost but is also able to more consistently perform it's most powerful play: Shoot Lock  </strong><span><strong>What Do The Archetypes Do?  </strong></span>Naturia is a stun deck, for the most part. It's a strange diversion from the usual combo-based strategies that their types (Plant and Insect) would normally imply. They are designed to control the match by having trigger-lick effects that activate whenever the opponent does something. Cosmobeet for example can Special Summon itself whenever the opponent Normal Summons a Monster. However, this strategy is only concerned with two Naturia monsters: Naturia Bamboo Shoot and Naturia Beast. With this build, it's entirely possible to Tribute Summon for Bamboo Shoot, if that fails we can Link or Synchro away the Naturia Monsters using the Rose Monsters we have in this build.  Rose is an archetype used by Akiza Izinski in the Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds manga and anime. Her Signer Dragon, Black Rose Dragon has been a staple of competitive play up until very recently as it is one of the few legal cards that can reset the board state. The Rose archetype consists of a variety of Plant monsters to aid in Synchro Summoning the dragon. The most consistent way to do this is to use Red Rose Dragon and White Rose Dragon. White Rose can Special Summon Red Rose and both give us effects when they are used as Synchro Material. With the new Field Spell White Rose Cloister, we can consistently pump out Synchro's and Links each and every turn!  <strong><span>Shoot Lock</span>  </strong>There is a reason why I chose to include Naturia monsters in this particular deck, and that is because of the strength of Shoot Lock, which can be set up as early as turn 1 with the right hand in this Deck. When Bamboo Shoot is Tribute Summoned using a Naturia monster, your opponent cannot activate Spells and Traps. Period. It's a one-sided Cold Wave that can severely disrupt or outright eliminate the opponent from the game. To protect Naturia Bamboo Shoot, I have included Safe Zone, a Continous Trap Card that makes it so Bamboo Shoot cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects nor can it be destroyed by battle. This strategy also cannot be stopped by Spell/Trap removal since Bamboo Shoot prevents the activation of such cards. It can be Kaiju'd over, so a Side Deck is advised in order to remove the Shoot Lock components to better counter your opponent.  <span><strong>The Strategy  </strong></span>You'll want to open up preferable with White Rose Cloister and the means to set up the Shoot Lock going first in game 1, this will shut down many strategies that require Spell Cards (Invoked, Shaddoll, etc.) While your opponent is sat twiddling their own thumbs, use the Rose monsters and begin building a Synchro and Link board to OTK your opponent. You'll want to make Black Rose Dragon or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon as early as possible. <strong>DO NOT ACTIVATE THE EFFECT OF BLACK ROSE DRAGON IF YOU HAVE SHOOT LOCK SET UP! </strong> Instead, just make as many big Synchro's as you can! We also run Red Eyes Dark Dragoon because of course we do.  As always, feedback and suggestions are welcome in the comments below!  Stay fresh! :)"

Then, use the tokens to link summon a ton of monsters with different attributes, then use those to link summon ""Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"".  An alternate way to use this deck, and possibly better for first turns, is to summon ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" instead of ""Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin"".  Then, by setting a spell/trap card, you can summon either ""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"" or ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon""."

Since their announcement and subsequent release on simulators, Tribrigade have managed to capture the imagination of many players as they offer a great deal of support to decks that match their three types (Beast, Beast-Warrior and Winged-Beast.) While many players are finding new way to play Zoodiacs (sigh) I decided to take it upon myself to try and bring back an archetype that has been gathering dust for years; everyone's favorite helmet deck Bujins!  </strong><span><strong>The Strategy</strong></span> This particular build of Bujin is not exactly Yamato sitting on Kaiser Colloseum, but rather uses Tribrigades to banish Bujingi monsters as well as others to make Link plays and create big boards. With the exception of Ash Blossom and Honest, everything in this deck is a Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged-Beast which gives the Tribrigades plenty of fuel to make plays. If it does go wrong, the Bujingi monsters can stay in the Graveyard and buy you a few turns. The key Rank 4s in this deck include Bujintei Amaterasu and Bujintei Kagutsuchi, the former brings back your banished Level 4s to make more plays whereas the latter mills 5 off the top of your deck allowing you to get started with your Link plays. The deck also runs Droplet to buy us time as well as fueling the Graveyard further as well as Pot of Acquisitiveness for some recursion.  This list is very experimental and I'm not used to playing combo decks so unfortunately I can't make a sample combo list for you.

I main deck 3 solemn strikes, because on the next turn, when I activate Zexal's effect, they have the chance to respond with gamma, ghost ogre, etc. So paying 1500 to negate that is easy. Also ash can stop gamma. If I don't have one of those, then I will search for fiendess in the first turn, because she's an omni negate if I control another subterror. I also side solemn judgment, because sometimes infinite impermanence will stop Zexal.  From there you just begin setting up your board. This deck is filled with hand traps of course. And each subterror monster has different effects. I run a playset of Pot of Extrav, either to use as ash bait, or if I didn't have the best drawing hand. You also need numeron wall, he's another good way to search the numeron network, or also serves as ash bait. I run 2 numeron calling's, because sometimes the 2nd one is necessary, in those pinches. As for subterror cave clash, not everyone runs it, but I think its a great card, because it lets you use subterror guru's quick effect, since you control another subterror card. Also when you do battle damage, you can grab your fiendess from the grave, and just keep recycling it. And of course subterror final battle is a super broken card, doesn't get sent to grave after being used, and 4 different effects, depending on the scenario. Lastly, this deck can easily go turn 2. You use numeron network to bring out all 4 numeron boys, and each time you attack, their attack doubles (they aren't required to detach to activate effect because of numeron network's effect). So you just climb your way up, and either beat over their big monster, or attack for game. And then if your opponent is still alive then you overlay for Zexal and back to square one."

Some of you might be thinking ""Why did you pick these two archetypes because that isn't even what Halloween is about."" Allow me to explain my reasoning. Halloween used to be called ""All Hallows' Eve"" and Christians used this to mourn about people in the afterlife, Ringing bells for the people in Purgatory, and wearing something like a mask so if someone in the afterlife wanted to kill your they couldn't figure out who you were. When we go trick or treating now it was actually because most Christians refused to eat meat until November 3 so they would bake Soul Cakes to hand out to other people and poor children would go from house to house and get a Soul Cake in exchange for praying for someone in the afterlife. The Jack O'Lantern was originally a turnip, they symbolized the souls of the dead, were originally called Soul Lights and people use it to guide lost souls back to their family while also using them to keep Demons away from their houses and family. Some people left bowls of milk and a large meal on their loved one's grave or their stairs while other baked pastries were known as ""Bones of the holy"" to give to the lost ones. People light tindle fires and all-night vigil bonfires as a way to pray for the dead."

I have some new projects in mind, but until I can make them, I present to you my second build of Convulsion Mine for October of 2020!  <span>The Strategy:  </span></strong>I've gone over the main method by which this build of Mystic Mine works so I'll keep it brief here. In essence, you want to use Convulsion of Nature so you can roleplay as Edward Snowden and know what your opponent has on the top deck at all times and using cards like Mind Crush to make them discard any cards that might give them an advantage, all while using cards like Archfiend's Oath to keep a consistent hand by declaring the top card's name and adding to your hand for 500 LP per activation. You can only use Oath once unless you have activate another copy of it. On a good day, this means that you can get anywhere from 3 to 5 cards in your hand per turn, 3 if you use Duality and two Oath's and 5 if you use Extravagance and two Oath's (Oath does not conflict with Extravagance as it does not draw.) To ensure our opponent bricks when we start to run out of ways to make them discard, we run 3 Goddess Skuld's Oracle; a card which may as well have Jeff Leonard's face on it at this point. It is a continuous Spell with an effect for Valkyries that we don't care about. What's more important is the activated ability of it which allows for us to re-arrange the top 3 cards of our opponents deck. With Convulsion, we can activate Skuld when we see our opponent is about to draw their get-out-jail-free card and put it on the bottom giving us 2 more turns of breathing room and our opponent 2 more turns of seething rage.  <span><strong>The Win Condition:   </strong></span>The win condition of this deck, believe it or not, is only partially fulfilled by Convulsion. Instead, we're doing it the old fashioned way by using Wave-Motion Cannon, Cauldron of the Old Man, and Final Countdown to win the game. Wave-Motion Cannon is even more potent game 1 due to a decrease in removal as is Cauldron of the Old Man. Final Countdown is a card that you can remove if you want to, I like to have it as an insurance policy of sorts (though many players online don't have the patience for 20 turns.) While the Wave-Motion Cannon has our opponents in it's sights, our Cauldron is putting in some work by refilling our LP so we can keep using Oath as well as burning the opponent, giving them less time for answers by allowing us to resolve Wave-Motion early.  <span><strong>Card Choices:  </strong></span>The new additions for this deck are of course Wave-Motion Cannon and Cauldron of the Old man as suggested by users combofan and LordObamaHimself. As well as Elder Entity N'tss to surprise any Dogmatika platers. Other than that, it's a pretty standard affair apart from the cards that make Convulsion work (Mind Crush, Drastic Drop Off, Prohibition, etc.) Change the build as you see fit.  As always, suggestions and feedback are always welcome in the comments below"

Here's the guide below, and a TL;DR at the bottom; Credit goes to Lifedeather for his great article and deck build, both of which were a good help in making this. Please read his article after this deck. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/forgotten-archetypes-armed-dragon/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/forgotten-archetypes-armed-dragon/</a> </span><span>Now, onto the deck guide! </span><span>I included many general use cards to help support the Armed Thunder Dragons, as to be honest, they're a frail bit frail. We have Raigeki, Monster Reborn, Pankratops, Instant Fusion, Evenly Matched, Ghost Ogre, Ash Blossom, and four Solemns. Raigeki can be a good board clearing tool for an OTK, Monster Reborn can bring back your monsters, Instant Fusion brings out Relinquished to steal an opponent's monster, Evenly Matched can clear a ton of the board, and the rest are negates. </span><span>I also included, when it comes to more useful dragons, the Keeper of the Shrine, and Koa'ki Meiru Drago. Since Level monsters leave the field when they Level up, Keeper is a free special summon when they Level up. Drago fully locks down Dark and Light decks, the two most common attributes right now. </span><span>Now, onto the main attraction, the Armed Thunder Dragons. The Armed Thunder Dragons Level themselves up, leaving the field and summoning their higher counterpart from the deck. All levels before 10 aren't very notable, just serving to get to 10. Meanwhile, 10 has an odd effect, referencing one of Chazz's lines i'm pretty sure. Anyway, it gains effects as it gains attack. The first few don't really matter, but the last two are quite important. His first important one allows you to send a card from your hand to the GY to destroy a card on the field, then Level 10 gains 1000 attack. Quite nice. His final one is unlocked when he's at 10,000 attack, and it's a dark hole and harpie's feather duster combined. 10,000 is very hard to get to, though, so I don't reccomend trying it. Meanwhile, there's also Armed Dragon Level 10 White. White doesn't actually have any monsters that level into him, instead just special summoning himself by banishing armed dragons from your graveyard who's level equal 10. While he's on the field, you take no effect damage, and when he attacks, you can pop another card your opponent controls. He's also quite nice. We also have the backrow support. Armed Dragon Blitz special summons a copy of one of your Level monsters from the deck, which is quite nice when used on level 10, as it can get you into an OTK range. Flash just special summons a Level 3, which is nice for starting off the Level climbing if there's none in your hand at the current moment, and freeing up your normal summon. Note: You'll want to go second for this, but going first isn't super bad. This is also an OTK based deck.</span>"

Fellow Friends of the Forest.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">First off I'd like to thank everyone for checking out my deck, this is my first here so I’m sorry if the formatting is a little off. Before I talk about the list I'd just like to point everyone to some top-notch Melffy resources, Renren's article <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffy-combo-fibrax-and-the-friends-of-the-forest/""><span class=""s3"">(here)</span></a> and Lilith Saintclaire's Deck-list and Guide <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffys-to-the-future-deck-recipe-and-guide/""><span class=""s3"">(here).</span></a> These are the resources that got me into the archetype and honestly they form the backbone of this list, if you want to get into Melffy I can't recommend them enough. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>2. Deck-List and Tech Choices.</b></span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s4""><b>The Main-deck Melffy and their Forest Friends. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Puppy x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This ratio is almost mandatory in any non-combo Melffy variant in my opinion. Its the Melffy you want see as a part of every end board with Forest, it summons your other Melffys or Kalantosa for pops, what more could you ask for? It's even searchable off Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue due to its convenient stat line.  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Catty x 3.</b> </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Catty is an interesting card and obviously you run at least 1. It's an omni-searcher for your entire deck and sets you up to make Herald on your opponent’s turn by searching Hop Ear Squadron, but it can feel bricky. I chose 3 for this deck due to expecting grind heavy meta match-ups; it's paid off for me but feel free to experiment with your own ratios. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Pony and Fenny x 1. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Pony and Fenny are the least useful main deck Melffys (next to Rabby, see below) but they can be surprisingly effective in niche hands. The main use for them is unclogging Kalantosas from the hand, and recycling Hop Ear Squadron and your other Melffy's from the grave. I play both at one to search with Catty or summon with Puppy but you can try more in your list.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Rabby x 0. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So originally I played a couple Rabby and its lagomorph comrade Rescue Rabbit. However, throughout my testing it kept bricking my hands even with Unexpected Dai at 3. I think there are better options for starters in the deck, especially the Fabled monsters (see next section) so I elected to remove Rabby. It's a shame, it's by far the cutest Melffy maindeck monster. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Rescue Cat x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Rescue Cat pulls a lot of weight in this list, single-handedly summoning 2/3rd's of your extra deck without locking you into beast types. I always want to see it in my opener (ideally alongside other starters/extenders) but even on its own a Naturia Beast is nothing to sneeze at. I wouldn't recommend running less than 3 if you're opting for a tempo build, but combo varies so feel free to see what works for you. A final note on the Rescue archetype here, if you choose to run the Rabby+Rabbit package you will obviously get more out of the archetypal support Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue (more on that below.) Although even without it, the ability to search Puppy and Cat was good enough in my testing.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Valerifawn, Peropero Cerperus, and Mine Mole x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">These are your turn 1 Naturia Beast setups with Rescue Cat; pick Mine Mole if you haven't drawn a Mellfy or Peropero for the surprise pop. Vallerifawn can be used to get to Halq for finishing games or sometimes Forest if you're desperate. I wouldn't mess with these ratios, although with an increased Fabled package you could try an extra Mine Mole for plusing off of Unicore on your turn with Chawa. (See the Fabled section for more on this.)</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Amazoness Pet Baby Tiger x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Our first pure extender, Amazoness Baby Tiger is a fantastic discard off of your Fabled cards or Egotistical Ape, or a good follow-up add of of Catty. The most consistent way to get it in the grave is as a summon off of Rescue Cat or Obedience Schooled and then using it as XYZs or Link material. You can even run Amazoness Call to get it in your hand or grave over Rescute Rescue if you prefer something that’s always live. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Egotistical Ape x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Our second extender and an excellent un-bricker of hands, Egotistical Ape allows you to make Naturia Beast or Halq from nearly any hand that includes him. My normal discards are the aforementioned Baby Tiger or a lone Fabled Cerburrel depending on where you want to end, even Peropero Cerperus can be choice as it can make him level 2 for XYZs plays. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Danger! Bigfoot x 2. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally a monster with a respectable attack stat! Danger! Bigfoot allows the deck to swing above its normal weight class, either with his attack stat, effect, or his convenient level in conjunction with a Synchro enabler we'll talk about soon. Bigfoot raises the deck’s ceiling considerably and since he's searchable by Catty you'll rarely have a match without him. Your ratios may vary but I’ve found 2 works well. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Yokotuner x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I'll be honest, Yokotuner is mostly here to clean up niche hands. I'm not going to expect to draw both my level 3s  and Obedience Schooled but if it happens then I have Yokotuner to still make Naturia Beast. Its also a target for Halq's effect in a pinch. It could easily be replaced with more Fabled support but this was the variant I went with.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Hop Ear Squadron x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Almost at the end of our Forest Friends we come to Hop Ear Squadron, the best target for Catty's search. It gets you a negate on your opponent’s turn in the form of Hop Ear plus any level 2 left on your board, ideally Kalantosa into Herald. If you're left with a Bigfoot on the field you can use Hop Ear to go into Leo Keeper of The Sacred Tree, who when combined with Borrelsword forms the most consistent OTK line my list has. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>The Fabled Nozoochee and Cerburrel x 2,1. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So finally we come to the Fabled package. Beyond just getting you into Forest in a pinch or going into Unicore off of Catty, I also like them as extenders to beef up your end boards. Sometimes that extra Hastorr or Sandayu proves too much for my opponent to out. If you would like to expand this package I recommend dropping the Rescute Rescue in favour of 3 Nozoochee and 3 Cerburrel alongside maybe a couple Chawa and a Ganashia, although those last 2 work better as starters for combo builds. I really enjoy playing the Fabled package so I recommend experimenting with this. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s4""><b>The Spells and...no just Spells. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Obedience Schooled x 3.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is a tough one. On the one hand you want to include this for the tempo swing it provides as it starts almost any play you might be making going first or second. On the other hand, it locks you into beasts, which lowers the ceiling on your plays. Practise with the deck’s plays can help you get more out of this card. I play 3 in this build because I'm aiming to resolve it with Rescue Cat for an explosive end-board (more on this in the Combo Guide) but in more combo or control-oriented builds it didn't preform nearly as well in my testing. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue x 3. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So I really like this one, it boosts the consistency of both your starter and of seeing Melffy Puppy due to a surprising (and I’m sure intentional) stat distribution. Since you want to see both of those cards all the time I consider this worth the 3 slots, that said its not always live. Due to the cost of your LP being lower there can be some awkward hands where it isn't quite usable, at least on turn 1. I run Upstart at 1 as an admittedly jank way to make it usable more often. That said, my latest testing has involved Verte Anaconda (more on this at the end) as a consistent way to lower life points so run whatever you prefer.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy Tag x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So Melffy Tag is pretty amazing, how many archetypes can boast a quick play Monster Reborn after all? It's searchable off of Forest for either extension or keeping key Melffys on the field. I find 3 to be unnecessary because of how searchable it is, 1 is doable but I miss the second copy in tempo builds specifically. Go with what works best for your needs.   </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Upstart Goblin x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So this was a rushed add the night before my last event. I only included it to make Rescute Rescue live more often going first. In all honesty this was a bad call, you very rarely draw it and Rescute Rescue in a hand where you actually need it to make a play. I've gone on to remove this in favour of more handtraps but feel free to experiment with this slot, its not essential to the deck. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Harpies Feather Duster x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Another rushed meta call days before the event, I was expecting more backrow-reliant decks but I didn't see that many. For a more synergistic option I'd recommend Twin Twisters for the discard, although in my current build I've opted for more copies of Forbidden Drop. This is a good slot for experimentation and meta-adjustment so experiment as you like.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Forbidden Droplet x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I think Droplet fits well in this deck for a multitude of reasons: it provides more discard options for your Fabled Cerburrel and Amazoness Baby Tiger for follow up plays, it insulates your board against powerful effect monsters going second, and really helps against other tempo decks. In my last tournament this came in the form of several 2-0's against Plunder Patroll but in testing it holds up against other forms of ramp/tempo as well. Against more general decks I'd probably switch this for Triple Tactics Talent as it can win some match-ups on its own (more on this below).</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>Handtraps and The Side. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So a short primer before I get into this section, I have included handtraps with the side due to my personal philosophy on siding and deck building in general. I prefer to use my side deck for anti-meta picks (often handtraps or equalizers) that I can cycle through for specific match-ups. That’s why I’ve lumped these together and because of this I’m not going to explain my picks for the side. You can use this space for whatever you like if you disagree, or you can try out my approach if you’d like. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit x 3. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is my standard pick for main-deck hand traps in the current meta. I find its live more often than Gamma in game 1, and game 2 the loss of power compared to Gamma matters less. Often I will switch this for a more matchup-dependant option like Ash, Veiler, or Gamma, but that’s down to personal taste. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>The Extra Deck.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Leo, Keeper of The Sacred Tree x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So our first extra deck monster is Leo, Keeper of the Sacred Tree, the second best Naturia synchro in the deck. He’s your largest body, the only Beast in the deck with over 3000 atk points he’s your answer to large threats that are vulnerable to battle. In-conjunction with Borrelsword Dragon he makes up the deck’s otk line, as a bonus he’s almost as hard to get rid of as Borrelsword in some circumstances. The most consistent line to make him involves Danger! Bigfoot with either Valerifawn on your turn or Hop Ear Squadron on your opponents turn.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Naturia Beast x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So here is the single most impactful card in the extra deck, next to Forest at least. Sometimes enough to win a game by itself, Naturia Beast is well suited to this archetype — perhaps more so than some of the Melffy extra deck monsters (Mommy is such a disappointment tbh).</span><span class=""s5""> </span><span class=""s1"">Aside from the obvious potential synergy of milling Tiger or the other discards, there’s also the fact that this build of Melffy really can’t otherwise contend with back-row decks or decks heavy on spell-based combo extension. Turning all of that off at almost no downside is very appealing.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">s mentioned above in the section on Rescue Cat, your best way to get to Naturia Beast is Valerifawn plus Peropero/Mine Mole off of the aforementioned Rescue Cat. I like to use Peropero going first as often opponents will walk over Naturia Beast instead of wasting valuable removal.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>The Fabled Unicore x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This one’s pretty funny, I can’t say I’d ever heard of it before I got into Melffy but it can be surprisingly powerful in some match-ups. It’s somewhat conditional due to your hand-size needing to match your opponents, but I’ve found its not that hard to maintain with the average hand (More on that in the combo guide). Sometimes it can even be made on top of a full board due to Nozoochee and Cerburrel not taking your normal summon, although don’t expect to draw both of them every hand. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Old Entity Hastorr x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I wasn’t expecting to make Hastorr as often as I did, but it really came through against the influx of Towers in the meta. Obviously it’s better with a couple negates supporting it but I managed to stall out some games with just Hastorr and some well-timed draws. I find it’s best made with the Fabled package instead of Unicore, but you can also make it with a normal-summoned Valerifawn in a pinch. I mentioned adding Twin Twisters instead of Harpies earlier and if you were to do that you’d probably pull off Hastorr’s second effect with more consistency. Another option is using Hastorr to punish board wipes when summoned off of Hop Ear Squadron during your opponents turn.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Herald of the Arc light x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few metas you’ll be incredibly familiar with this one. It’s a negate and a sort-of Macro Cosmos, and it’s the perfect level to be made off of Hop Ear plus a spent Kalantosa on your opponents turn. There isn’t really a reason not to play this and there aren’t any worthwhile alternatives that I’ve found, so get used to seeing this one. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Crumble Logos The Prophet of Demolition x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This was a pretty unspecific pick, the Rank 2 XYZs pool is interesting but somewhat light on Interaction so Crumble Logos was my pick among them. Forest is better in most cases, always going first and sometimes going second depending on your grave set-up and hand. You can’t summon him under Obedience Schooled but I mostly find myself summoning him on the crack-back so that really doesn’t matter as much (see Combo Guide for details). You could play most any other Rank 2 here if you wanted, for example Sky Cavalry Centaurea or Excited Melffys for Negalogia set-ups once it’s released. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Ronin Raccoon Sandayu x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">The Raccoon archetype is a good fit for Melffy Tempo, especially the boss monster. It can provide an out to anything without battle protection or another protected monster to draw out removal. It can easily be summoned off of Bujinki Ahashima to trigger its effect on your turn, and it’s a good out to a weak board post-handtrap. I play this one in all my Melffy decks because it’s just so versatile, I would really recommend the same unless you desperately need the slot. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Melffy of the Forest x 2.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally we arrive at Forest, the only Melffy XYZs currently worth playing, at least till Excited Mellfys comes to the TCG. (No one can make me play Mommy.) It searches any Melffy card on your turn, normally Puppy if you didn’t draw it or Tag if you want to extend a little more. On your opponent’s turn Forest is an incredibly disruptive card in this build as your opponent likely has no way of knowing what sort of interaction Forest will put up beyond the obvious effect negate. In my opinion Forest is the archetype’s best card and the center of my build, remove at your own risk. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Topologic Zeroboros x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So the Link monsters in this deck are mostly for toolboxing on your opponents turn using I:P Masquerana with any spent Melffys or Kalantosas. Zeroboros’s role in all this is to clear boards that none of our aforementioned interaction could stop. Zeroboros for it’s part is excellent removal, especially considering you can trigger it with a sacrificial Melffy during the end phase of your turn in a pinch. There are other options for this slot, and all the other Masq targets, but that’s format-dependant so I’ll leave that to your judgment. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Borrelsword Dragon x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Borrelsword is a large, indestructible threat that you ideally drop on your opponent’s turn to finish them on the crack-back. Alternatively, you can make it on your turn through use of Halq and Valerifawn or Yokotuner on your turn for a swift OTK. If you feel more inclined to push for swift lethal on your turn you could swap this out for Accesscode Talker or even Decode Talker if you’re on a tight budget. I’ve experimented with running Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax as an option for protecting boards and it works well but limits your OTK options. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Knightmare Unicorn x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">If you are seeing a pattern then yes, Unicorn is the last Masquerana target. It is good direct non-destructive removal, as ideally you’re going to be plusing off of its effect (See Combo Guide). The other Knightmares can be valuable if you can find the space for them. I have a dedicated build for that and some neat tech in the works, so we’ll see how the larger Knightmare suite works out. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Bujinki Ahashima x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This is my favourite tech in the extra, it’s such a powerful addition to certain boards and such a good fit for the archetype aside from its inconvenient typing. I’ll go over more of the combos below but you’re looking to use Ahashima at the start of the game to put up itself, Forest, and a Melffy, ideally Puppy for the disruption. This leaves you with a pop (assuming Puppy), an effect negate, and a spell or trap pop; decent for a board that most hands can make. This slot could always be used for Fire Fighting Daruma Doll or Missus Radiant if you’re so inclined but I prefer this. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>Crystron Halqifibrax x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Welcome to the 2020 meta: Halqifibrax is absolutely everywhere, even the forest. We play him here as an OTK enabler with either Valifawn or Yokotuner on your turn into the link 4 of your choice. There are as many options here as there are Synchro builds so go wild or check out Renren’s article I linked at the top.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>I:P Masquerana x 1.</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I’ve already mentioned at length the use of Masquerana but I’ll go over it in full here. If you have 2 monsters spare after any of your primary lines, Masquerana is an excellent way to generate more interaction and make your Link 4 of choice nigh unstoppable. In the tighter extra decks of combo Melffy I’ve experimented with using Artifact Dagda instead for the Scythe lock, and you could definitely try that in this build once the extra deck gets tighter (see Future Thoughts). </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>3. ""Combo"" Guide and Tips</b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So now we arrive at the strategy section of this decklist. If the quotation marks didn’t give it away there’s not exactly a lot of combos here, so instead I’m going to go over 5 opening hands and what you can make with them by the end of turn 1. I will also include some stats for the 5 openings to hopefully give you some idea as to what the deck can do on average, as well as suggestions for follow up plays. I will try to add replays in future but I hope this suffices for now. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Disclaimer: My math may not be accurate to the exact percentile, I’d allow for a couple percent either side to be safe if that degree of accuracy matters to you. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>1. Rescue Cat + Obedience Schooled + Normal Summon Lv 2. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">I decided to start with the optimal opening hand, or at least some version of it. You have a <b>15% </b>of opening this hand, assuming Rescute Rescue is live (It’s <b>9%</b> if not). From this position my normal end board looks like Forest plus Puppy, Naturia Beast with Peropero in the grave, and Ronin Raccoon with a 2300 attack token. The way you get to this is up to you; I prefer to resolve Obedience Schooled first to bait any Ash Blossom or other hand traps. The result of this is 3 level 2 Monsters, your pick but I normally go to: Baby Tiger, Nozoochee, and a Melffy. You go into Forest and Sandayu with these plus your normal summon; I would advize getting the Melffy and Baby Tiger in the grave for a clean follow-up play. Next play Rescue Cat into Naturia Beast, using your choice of Peropero or Mine Mole depending on what you need. From there a lot of it depends on how your opponents turn plays out; if you can end on Naturia Beast the game is likely over. If not, your best bet is either Halq or Masq into Borrelsword depending on their end board. Sandayu is capable of taking care of a lot of non-Towers threats once it’s on the board so I tend to lean on that to clean up.</span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>2. Obedience Schooled + Amazoness Baby Tiger. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">So this hand isn’t super likely in this build coming in at <b>7% </b>but I wanted to mention it as it leaves you with more cards in hand than most of the hands I’m going over. The end board for this is very similar to the one above except without Naturia Beast: a Forest plus Puppy and Sandayu with protection. The route to this board starts with Schooled for the second Baby Tiger (Remember to special the first from your hand with its effect) and two level 2 monsters. I like Melffy Pony and a Nozoochee here normally. From there we XYZs summon Forest with the Melffy plus any of the other level 2s, activating it’s effect for Puppy if you didn’t draw it, and finally summoning Sandayu with the remaining monsters. This leaves you with a pop and effect negate plus an indestructible Sandayu providing you have a beast. Some decks can be stopped by just the pop and negate but I wouldn’t expect it to stop meta. This normally leaves you with Sandayu to clean up the board and a spent Kalantosa. As mentioned above I like using Sandayu to resolve non-Towers boards and then link it plus either the Kalantosa or your normal summon (if you have one) into Masquerana for a follow up play plus your returning Puppy. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>3. The Fabled Cerburrel and Nozoochee + a Melffy. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">This hand is a pretty rare draw at <b>10% </b>but I wanted to go over it to give you an idea of how these cards can be used alongside other boards as you draw into them. The end board this hand produces leaves you with The Fabled Unicore and a Melffy, ideally Puppy or Catty for the pop or negate they provide. The reason this board composition work is because due to Melffys’ special summoning/returning to the hand gimmick you can manipulate your hand size with minimal difficulty. This can be good to bait your opponent into inoptimal lines, and as long as you can get to Catty and Rescue Cat you can follow up with nearly any monster in the extra. As above Masq is an excellent follow up with spare Kalantosas or any Melffys, although for board breaking I like Ahashima into Sandayu for a backrow pop into a token to run over anything your opponent managed to summon.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b>4. Catty + Bigfoot. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Another two-card combo but this one shows up a bit more often at <b>10%</b>, especially as the game progresses due to the pieces being highly searchable off of Forest and Catty itself. The play requires you to resolve Bigfoot first so there is always the risk that you discard Catty, but fortunately you’re much more likely to hit one of the deck’s many discards. Once you have Bigfoot on the field and providing you summon Catty at the end of the turn, you can search Hop Ear and use its effect with Bigfoot to summon Leo Keeper of the Sacred Tree. This can be a rough one to out due to its odd protection effect and high attack value so I recommend combining it with other interaction to seal out the game. My normal follow up is using Halq to climb into Borrelsword with a bounce on the way to clear up any threats. Normally this closes out the game but I’d recommend managing your resources for follow-up plays. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s4""><b> 5. Any Melffy + Any Lv 2 Normal Summon. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Finally I thought I’d go over a less-than-ideal opening hand, and at <b>48% </b> chance<b> </b>to show up you’re likely to see this one a lot. It’s important to mention that this will most likely show up with some of the other hands mentioned above: it has a <b>25%</b> to show up with 1 of your 2 main starters. This will obviously change how you resolve the hand but I figured I’d mention how best to resolve these pieces alone, as a lot of it carries over to maintaining tempo in-conjunction</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">ith other hands mentioned above. There’s no ideal 2 cards to see here, obviously it’s better to see Puppy or Catty with Tiger but I’ve made this hand work with Pony and Kalantosa. To start you’ll want to set whatever your normal is, unless your Melffy is Catty in which case you may want to normal it for a Hop Ear play on your opponents turn. Once you’ve summoned or set and resolved any useble spells, you want to end turn and special your Melffy. Depending on what Melffy you have you hopefully have 1 pop/negate on your opponent’s turn, likely leaving you with a spent Kalantosa plus whatever you set or potentially a Herald or Hastorr. If you’re left with even one level 2 on the board you’re probably still in it; my advice for a follow up would be to get into Forest or Naturia Beast as fast as possible. Both of these options will put up more disruption and hopefully let you stall out your opponent’s win condition long enough for you to out-tempo them.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><b>4. Future Options and Last Thoughts. </b></span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">At last we come to the end of this guide! I’d like to thank anyone who read the whole thing. I hope its been helpful and if you weren’t already into Melffy as a tempo deck I hope you’ll give it a try. I built this deck to enter into YCS 9 (See MBT’s channel for more on that <a><span class=""s6"">here</span></a>) and although I didn’t make anything close to top cut, I was still impressed with its performance. I’d like to take a minute to go over some of my thoughts as to the future of the deck, along with some of the cards I’m excited to test when they release later this year.</span><span class=""s5"">  </span><span class=""s1"">irst among those cards is obviously Excited Melffys: from setting up Negalogia AA-Zeus on your turn with its direct-attacking effect to recycling any Kalantosa from the grave for more pops on your opponent’s turn, it’s an amazing addition to the archetype. Since I mentioned it already Negalogia is also a very welcome addition with its Rainbow Neos-esque board wipe, and there are even some interesting synergies with its ability to add material from almost anywhere. I will definitely be adding this one come November. I’d also like to go over Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon and its currently released summoning aide Number F0: Utopic Future. I did consider putting Future in this build but without Future Dragon it lacks a lot of the utility for such high investment. Once Dragon comes out it will likely become my go-to follow-up play as it packs protection, a beefy attack stat and a negate that steals your opponent’s monsters. Common outs like Knightmare Unicorn will fizzle to the negate before being stolen for a swift OTK with Borrelsword, I’d keep an eye on this one especially. </span></p> <p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Thanks again for reading, I intend to continue to play Melffy and will put out more guides as I test and refine my list so watch this space.

I've come up with a combo no one else has seen (like I have in the past with my other decks). This combo uses the card <a data-name=""Torque Tune Gear"">Torque Tune Gear</a>. You guys are probably wondering what the heck is this card? Well its a light union tuner monster that is a <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a> target. Yes, thats right, it can be used for full Halifibrax combo. I've made <a data-name=""Union Hanger"">Union Hanger</a> and <a data-name=""Unauthorized Reactivation"">Unauthorized Reactivation</a> a one card full synchro combo. This deck always wants to go first, it can setup many negates with the full synchro combo everyone knows and probably hates at this point haha. It can also end in ABC Buster Dragon too. It just depends on your hand. The Mekk-Knights allow you to go second too but its an extending engine for the combos. Lastly, <a data-name=""Buster Blaster"">Buster Blaster</a> in the side deck is a spicy tech I have come up with that is pretty good in my opinion for going second with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> as its also a Union Driver target. I have uploaded the combos to mediafire in two .yrpX files as you guys in the past have asked me to showcase the combos. This is how you can! Just go ahead and download the replays, drag them into your ProjectIgnis replays folder and run edopro and click replays and you should be able to watch the replays! Rest assured, mediafire is safe. It scans the files you are going to upload for viruses before it uploads them.

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Zoodiac"", known as ""Twelve Beasts"" (十じゅう二に獣ししJūnishishi) in the OCG, is an archetype of Level/Rank 4 EARTH Beast-Warrior monsters that debuted in ""Raging Tempest"".

Nice Control,"After testing this deck (with a few adaptions and this final build - any advices on better cards are very welcome) for a few hours, I think this deck might be doing well against combo decks. (when going first obviously)  This deck has a few options to start with:  Invoked-Engine: Therefore you have a few starters, in total it is 7 (3 Meltdown, 1 Terraformin, 3 Aleister). Which lead you to a 4th summon Mechaba (wow, so creative lul). The good thing here is, if you have Parallel Exceed in your starting hand, you can easily get him after summoning Almiraj and going into a Rafflesia/Dweller and further go with building your board, where Mechaba is either your 6th or 7th (after the xyz summon) summon, which makes you get hit by Nibiru, except you go for Rafflesia 5th summon and are safe from Nibiru.  Salamangreat-Engine: The Salamangreat-Engine is rather secondary here, as it performs well with Almiraj if you have Gazelle in hand. With Gazelle you put Roar most of the times to the grave, unless you have extenders like Spinny or Fowl in order to get a relinked Sunlight Wolf to get Rage back to hand. Both works pretty fine. In order to have access to Gazelle you run 3 Minings as well as the 1 Salamangreat Circle, which means you basically have 5 Gazelles in hand.  Combined: In this deck you more or less run 7 Aleisters as well as 5 Gazelles. 1 Aleister and 1 Gazelle will lead you to an endboard of at least: Mechaba, Salamangreat Roar, Relinked Balelynx. Every futher extender can bring more cards to the board. 1 Parallel eXceed is Dweller/Rafflesia. Other Salamangreat extenders will help you building your board stronger like reincarnated Sunlight Wolf with Rage/Roar.  I think this deck makes a good impression."

But most Fiend archetypes are pretty weak in the current meta. Still, repeatedly looking at the best Fiends and Fiend related cards got me interested in Evil Eye. This is a going first stun deck, where the goal is to set up Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye and equip him with Evil Eye of Selene, but it does go a bit deeper than that. But if you aren't okay with just dropping Serziel and floodgates, this is not the deck for you.  1 Terraforming, 3 of the Field spell and 3 Serziel are must ofs, in every list for a reason. This is your main engine, your starter and boss monster all off of 1 card. I'm on 1 of each of the monsters - it basically doesn't come up where you want 2 of them, and the deck searches them out for the combos you use them in. Gorgon is necessary to the deck's grind game, since you can loop either the field spell or Evil Eye Defeat over and over to keep your game going, but she's useless turn 1 and easily searched out, so I'm fine with 1 of. Basilius enables a bunch of combos, but this deck isn't built to extend to the ""full"" board as often as possible, so because of the way the deck is built it is fine at 1, and I wouldn't go higher than 2. Catoblepas is also involved in some of the decks combos, basically these two cards are very useful for setting up Zerrziel plays, and are very useful combo pieces, but you aren't a combo deck, so 1 each is fine. 2 each of the equip spells is fine - I wouldn't run more or less. They're strictly combo pieces, and searchable ones, but they're also a core part of the deck's engine. You could run 3 Selene, but Goroneio's effect is one you often want to use twice in a game. 2 Retribution and 2 Defeat might seem odd if you're just looking at their value as interruption, but Retribution is really important game 2 and 3 for protecting your backrow, and Defeat loops are the best grindy thing the deck can do. 1 each of Reemergence and Awakening is lower than most builds, but the deck has a lot of reasons to prefer Serziel stun over Zerrziel turbo. However, having an option in the deck to play a slightly more ""combo"" game is really useful, and both cards have good utility, besides which I want half the deck to be Evil Eye cards that I can discard for Gorgoneio.  I felt like card advantage/hand sculpting was important to the deck, partially to ensure you see your Serziel, and partially to ensure you hit your floodgates. Since we aren't really using the extra deck, I'm running 3 Pot of Extravagence and 3 Pot of Duality. Extravagance has a chance of hitting an extra deck card you might want, but there's more than enough space to run 3 of each, and you barely need your extra deck, so it makes a lot of sense. Pot of Duality is one of those big factors away from the more comboish elements of the deck, but the card selection it grants is amazing, and it works incredibly well alongside Extravagance, and most of the time you don't even want to special summon anything anyways.  For floodgates I have 6 cards - 2 each of Rivalry of Warlords, There Can Be Only One, and Summon Limit. Rivalry of Warlords is the easiest of the floodgates for this deck to play under, but it also is the weakest in the meta at the moment. Nonetheless, it will cut off most decks from Halqifibrax/Auroradon/Linkross, and more importantly, it ""combos"" with There Can Be Only One to lock opponents into a single monster on the field at a time. There Can Be Only One is the best of these, and basically screws over all the best meta decks by itself.  Artifact Sanctum and a single Artifact Scythe are in the deck. Thanks to Serziel, the deck actually can pop it's own cards for value, albeit slowly, and they can also lock opponents out of the extra deck for a turn - basically, useful in both control match-ups and combo match-ups. In game 2 these should be Solemns. Gamma is the only hand trap in the main deck - you can add Imperm and Droll in game 2/3 going second, but we're really not built to go second, and if you need a hand-trap for going second right now, Gamma is probably your best option.  Go first in some game 1s, run into some combo match-ups, and you could theoretically do well with Evil Eye."

 What I want to see is representative of what is commonly seen on Halloween in terms of costumes.  Primarily what kids wear.  We talking PRINCESSES!  We talking SUPERHEROES.  So let’s make a deck based around these things.  &nbsp;  So first, I wanted to select the classic Princess from the Fairy Tail cards – Prinzessin.  This is the centerpiece of the deck, so I’ve got to include all that support.  I’ve got 3 Prinzessin of course, along with 3 Golden Castle of Stromberg, 3 Pumpkin Carriage, 2 Glass Slippers, 2 Iron Knight, 2 Iron Hans, 2 Iron Cage.  The full package.  And hey, the Pumpkin thing was a total coincidence, so that’s pretty nice.  This takes up a good portion of the deck.  &nbsp;  Let’s find another princess, perhaps.  I wanted Blizzard Princess but they didn’t really fit at all so no to that.  So okay, I’ll give you your obligatory zombie, you cowards.  I’ve put in Pumprincess, the Princess of Ghosts because hey it may be a zombie and another pumpkin, but at least it’s a princess.  And that’s what it’s all about.  Goshdarn princesses.  I don’t want to see another zombie fruit unless it’s got a tiara on its head.  &nbsp;  Okay, let’s move onto the next phase.  Kids love to dress up as superheroes on Halloween.  It’s a bajillion dollar industry.  Who better than the classics, the Elemental HERO archetype.  Let’s get some good stuff in there.  We got 3 Stratos, 2 Shadow Mist, a Solid Soldier, a Liquid Soldier.  3 Mask Change too.  We’re running a bit tight on deck space, gonna have to go over 40 soon if I want in that Miracle Fusion and Polymerization in there, so 1 of each of those.  We got a bunch of non-heroes in too, so let’s stick in a Mask Change II so it can maybe fix a mismatched hand.  &nbsp;  I’ve also stuck in a copy of Elemental HERO Burstinatrix because we needed a boss-ass lady.  This doesn’t really add anything to deck, but I wanted one of the classics and she’s cool.  &nbsp;  The HERO Extra Deck has some regular Mask Change targets.  I’ve put in Dark Law, of course, as well as Blast, Acid and Dian.  Earth is fairly common here what with those Iron guys supporting the Princess, so Dian works out nice.  Elemental HERO Gaia also fits in that regard, along with the princess going towards Elemental HERO The Shining.  For good measure, we got Escuridao, Absolute Zero and Sunrise.  &nbsp;  But we aren’t done yet.  I wanted another breed of hero.  A hero that were famous for those lovely budget Halloween costumes back in the day.  The mighty morphin’ Power Rangers.  Why, as a young boy, I was also a Power Ranger.  Let’s stick in Super Quants to round this thing off.  Blue Layer is a pretty nice deck thinning engine, so I put him at 3.  Especially since we’re at 42 cards here in the Main.  Then let’s squeeze in 2 Green Layers, 1 Red Layer and 1 White Layer.  2 copies of Super Quantal Fairy Alphan too; I bet there are some Fairy outfits out there as well.  For the Extra Deck, we just enough room for 1 of each for Lusterrex, Magnaliger, Aeroboros and Grampulse, which appear to all be generic summons, so that’s nice.  Alphan should deal with any level disparity.  Then of course, the Link being Blaster Magna and their Xyz Boss Great Magnus.  Some of that Megazord action.  &nbsp;  To round the deck off at a somewhat clean 42, we need a costume for the adults.  All those certain nurse outfits, you know the one.  Injection Fairy Lily.  Hopefully you will enjoy seeing this build.  I know barely anything about how Super Quants work.  But I hope I’ve painted a more accurate view of the Halloween climate without any of those lame skeletons and sheet ghosts walking around."

Side deck is the best part of the deck, gnomaterial is excellent agains link decks, and going second, this is a going first zombie deck, but if you need to go second, changing the extra Jack o bolan, danger nessie and the dragon buster for gnomaterial is pretty good, against pendulums, Mistake, was the card of the game, decks search way more than before, droll and lock bird DONT DO ENOUGH, Mistake pretty much stops pendulums, also since zombies dont really search to ad to the hand, the sinergy is perfect, those are the 2 main side deck spices.  &nbsp;  Sanctum in main deck it just comes in handy, many time union carrier lock is plan B or C, it doesnt come up as beneficial sometimes, so the artifact and sanctum spice come in perfect. Last but not least, I:P and avremax, if you are playing against a deck with alot of destructive power or many ways of interupting, making a avremax with I:P, just wins, and its fairly easy to make first turn or on your oponents if you dont go the savage dragon combo.  &nbsp;  Get those secrete rare mistakes before the buyout, it really does feel like a better solution than droll, for the fact zombies tend to resist a otk usually. anf if not, the long battle tend to weaken the deck, so slowing down the game with Mistake HELPS."
