A ""brief"" description of the card line-up;

<span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>

<strong>Infernoid Onuncu x2: </strong>Dark Hole and backrow negate, two to keep Imagination as a useful card after sending one with Decatron.
<strong>Infernoid Devyaty x2: </strong>Heavy Storm and monster negate, same logic as Onuncu.
<strong>Infernoid Seitsemas x1: </strong>Very good removal effect on battle phase, summonable with one Decatron using Feast, and quick effect DD Crow.
<strong>Infernoid Sjette x1: </strong>Not as good as Seitsemas, but can be summoned with two Decatrons using Feast, and also quick effect DD Crow.
<strong>Infernoid Patrulea x1: </strong>Spell destruction, and DD Crow on the opponent's turn. Can be sided out for another Harmadik against monster-heavy decks.
<strong>Infernoid Harmadik x1: </strong>Monster destruction, and DD Crow on the opponent's turn. Can be sided out for another Patrulea against backrow-heavy decks.
<strong>Infernoid Decatron x3: </strong>Can be any Infernoid, easily searchable with Feast, can be linked off into Almiraj after Normal summoning. All around good boy.

<strong>Subterror Behemoth Umastryx x1: </strong>Being able to flip to banish is great, and easily doable on the opponent's turn with Final Battle.
<strong>Subterror Guru x3: </strong>Flips to search the whole archetype, quick effect book of moon while you control another Subterror <em>card, </em>he plays nice with everything. Can also be used to turn Tierra face-down after summon to bring out a big Infernoid from grave.
<strong>Subterror Nemesis Archer x1: </strong>Phenomenal field removal, being able to shuffle cards back into the deck, and also floats into any Subterror monster.
<strong>Subterror Fiendess x3: </strong>A handtrap negate at the ""cost"" of turning a Subterror monster face-down. Easily recyclable from grave. Also brings out Subterrors from grave as a last-ditch rescue move if necessary.

<span><strong>Spells:</strong></span>

<strong>The Hidden City x3: </strong>Searching, a free flip, and attack prevention that works wonders with Guru's search or Umastryx's banish.
<strong>Void Vanishment x3: </strong>Search either Feast or Imagination depending on the need, at a negligible cost, and then destroy it for Feast's cost. Its second effect also occasionally comes up. It just needs to be played after Subterror combos.
<strong>Void Imagination x2: </strong>Resolving this is often game, especially if Guru/City are already on the field. Mill six of choice from deck is beautiful, and then destroy 3 opponent's cards with Elder Entity N'tiss.
<strong>Terraforming x1: </strong>More Hidden City.
<strong>Reasoning x1: </strong>A free summon, where excavating doesn't hurt this deck.
<strong>Subterror Cave Clash: </strong>Makes Guru's Book of Moon effect a quick effect, and gives you free recycling of Subterror cards (usually Fiendess).
<strong>Pot of Duality: </strong>A blessing going first, saves bricky hands in a deck that doesn't often need its special summon on turn one.

<span><strong>Traps:</strong></span>

<strong>Subterror Final Battle x2: </strong>Searchable trap that resets itself after use to either buff your monsters, prevent negation, or flip either up or down.
<strong>Void Feast x1: </strong>As long as you've got another Void card, it's two free negates and a DD Crow on field if this is able to resolve. It helps that the searcher is a continuous spell Void card.
<strong>Lost Wind x2: </strong>Permanent negate and attack half that recurs from the grave, even if milled by Reasoning.
<strong>There Can Be Only One: </strong>Sometimes hurts Infernoids, but doesn't prevent Void Feast from resolving, allowing you to fill your grave with up to 5 Infernoids, and doesn't bother Subterrors at all.

<span><strong>Extra Deck: </strong></span>

<strong>Elder Entity N'tiss x3: </strong>Just to send to GY with Tierra to destroy opponent's cards.
<strong>Infernoid Tierra x3: </strong>Big boss that sends cards to GY, running 3 means you can send extra Tierras if you don't need to send 3 N'tiss.
<strong>Borreload Dragon x1: </strong>Bigger boy
<strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos x1: </strong>Big boy, it's also surprisingly easy to summon this boy in a longer game with Decatron after sending almost any Infernoid.
<strong>Knightmare Phoenix: </strong>Emergency backrow removal
<strong>Knightmare Cerberus: </strong>Emergency monster removal
<strong>Linkuriboh:</strong> To link away negated Decatrons or Fiendess in a pinch
<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj: </strong>To link away normal-summoned Decatrons that are in danger staying on the field.
<strong>Predaplant Triphyoverutum: </strong>Amazing Super Poly target if your opponent gets three monsters on board, plus isn't blocked by TCBOO.
<strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: </strong>The more relevant Super Poly target."

Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

Deck count (44)

Monsters:
<ul>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician </a>- (You gotta see vannila, hell you even don't mind searching 2 off Illusion magic because Chaos Maxx is lvl 8 so he requires a bit monsters for proper ritual summon you can just cheat him out with Magician of Chaos</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> - Counts as dark magician, can pop cards when the card or effect is activated (So you can flip Ethernal soul not use it right away and you ll get a window where you can trigger Magician of chaos to pop something, Uneffected by card effs if you have soul out also soul can revive him (Counts as DM).</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Magician of Black Chaos Max"">Magician of Black Chaos Max</a> - <strong>There are 2 MAIN Ways to summon this card during opp turn</strong>. This card is literally azathot 2.0. Flavour of the deck</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Magician of Dark Illusion"">Magician of Dark Illusion</a> - this card to can revive Magician of Chaos, so better then in standard Dark magician</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion magician"">Apprentice Illusion magician</a> - you gotta see dark magician for the most ritual spells, I run 2 because faithful can always stack it if you need ""honest"" eff</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Magicians Rod"">Magicians Rod</a> - You can activate Extravagance chain faithful servant to draw him. Ofc I built my deck to see Magicians rod as much as possible hence all the draw power to go with faithful servant, its the best card.</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Magician's Soul"">Magician's Soul</a> - Another card which can revive Magician of Chaos, You can pitch Chaos Form to draw if you drew preparation of rites which can add back ritual spells on top of searching Magician of Chaos. Also pitch that navigation</li>
</ul>
Spells
<ul>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">Allure of darkness</a> (You can run 3 even, tho there is mini overlap with extravagance then + this way my deck is ocg legal to)</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Upstart goblin"">Upstart goblin</a> (Works with faithful servant and Dark Magic Circle)</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Pot of extravagance"">Pot of extravagance</a> - Faithful servant overlap doesn't matter because it has amazing synergy with it since faithful servant is a quickplay</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Preparation of rites"">Preparation of rites</a> - we are trying to see the ritual + this can add back chaos form</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a> - searchable of Dark Magicial circle you can use graveyard to ritual summon which is huge.</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Advanced ritual art"">Advanced ritual art</a> - not searchable but you don't need dark magician in your hand to ritual summon.. enables ethernal soul to. I really like it</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dark Magic Secrets"">Dark Magic Secrets</a> - quickplay ritual / fusion summon. Due to imduk you can drop the dragun, could be a one off in theory</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Magicalized fusion"">Magicalized fusion</a> - So the Dragun of red-eyes Red-eyes combo had an errata now it requires a red-eyes</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Faithful Servant"">Faithful Servant</a> - The latest Dark Magician card which boosts the consistency, ofc you can stack chaos form and Magician of chaos</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark Magic inheritance"">Dark Magic inheritance</a> - a card I wouldn't run in pure dark magician but this deck just has more spells since its ritual based. Barely made the list. Searches cards which mention Dark Magician by banishing 2 spells from grave</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Illusion Magic"">Illusion Magic</a> - This way rod can net you 2 dark magicians for Maxx drop. There are 4 dark magicians circle can reveal with this card in a deck % consistency,</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark magic circle"">Dark magic circle</a> - Dark magician pot of duality (oh yeah no duality in this build, since we are trying to drop the max else it helps you see rod)</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark magic attack"">Dark magic attack</a> - What backrow?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Magicians Navigation"">Magicians Navigation</a> - barely made a cut, very good when discarded, I mean cards which negate are great</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Ethernal soul"">Ethernal soul</a> - Lol search Dark Magic attack / revive each turn including Magician of Chaos</li>
</ul>
Extra deck (Keep in mind running extravagance)
<ul>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Predaplant verte Anaconda"">Predaplant verte Anaconda</a> - sends magicalized fusion, drops Dragun ideally or the Dark Magicians</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Imduk the World chalice Dragon"">Imduk the World chalice Dragon</a> - key type dragon, can also destroy a card he points to by card effect (at the start of the damage step)</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> - the most summoned extra deck card so at 3, as you rarely have vannila for imduk since you are summoning rituals not Dark Magician</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> - puts Dark magician in graveyard + adds another disruption with Unicorn just great</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> - look above</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Selene, the sacred Sovereign of Magic"">Selene, the sacred Sovereign of Magic</a> - 3rd way to perform an azathot combo, I mean staple in most spellcaster decks</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ebon High Magician"">Ebon High Magician </a>- ah dark spellcasters could really use a worthy target to summon of this dude</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ebon Illusion Magician"">Ebon Illusion Magician</a> - Removal, swarming</li>

Check. Orcusts hit on the banlist? Check. Still rokking? Check. With the new Borrelend Dragon, this combo deck will have mega ridicul","Both Dragon Link and Orcust deck have similarity, like both are dark and even in your brickest hand, you can still push through while restricted to only can summon dark monsters because of Rokket Synchron, Tracer, and the Orcusts. Both have great GY interaction too. Rip TCG Harp Horror, now it's hard to splash orcust, i'm putting this in non-meta catergory.

Combo is simple but needs practice cus it has multiple ways to establish the board with different combination of extenders (esp when you have to play through handtraps), I will explain the most common 2 routes. Before starting, you have to manage your hand first, like the draw cards (should you use it first/not). Essentially, any draw cards should be used later after you are finished searching/ss your combo pieces so you can maximize your card advantage.

First route, you have to summon Romulus, add Ravine, dump cards from hand (Orcust) and deck (dragon), then manage your way to the Guardragon/s (Pisty isn't necessary, but it's a nice extender), then summon Borrelend using the Guardragons so you can continue to Orcust, and do the Orcust basic combo (not I:P, but the Galatea+Ding+Crescendo or Galatea+Babel+GY Ding and Cymbal). Extenders like GY Absorouter+Synchron and Destrudo (ss targetting cymbal, synchro with baby chaos dragons, Gateway, Grepher, or Harp) can be used to make Borreload Savage.

Second route is the harder route like if you open bad or have to play through handtraps. This route you have to go to Beat Cop/Dillingerous to do regular Dragon Link combo or just pure regular Orcust.

Cards played at 3 copies cus you wanna see it the most, while the 2 copies are either cus banlist and you wanna see it often but is hopt or dont wanna open doubles, one copy cus banlist or searchable.

The Dragon Links: 2 Absorouter (1 fo dump, 1 for extender), 1 Destrudo (tuner, extender), 3 Seyfert (main opener, searching, preferrably Collapserpent), Collapserpent and Wyverbuster (great dragon extenders), 1 or 2 Gateway Dragon (extender, great for going second), 2 Tracer and 2 Synchron (extender++ but locking to dark extra deck), 1 Boot Sector Launch (extender, great going second), and lastly, 3 Quick Launch (extender, not hopt).

The Orcusts: 2 Wand, 3 Knightmare,  1 Girsu, 1-2 Cymbal, 1 Brass (tuner, One for One target), 2 Return, 1 Babel, 1 Crescendo.

The Dumpers (what tie the deck together): Dark Grepher (extender using Absorouter, Destrudo, Wand, or Orcust Knightmare), Brotaur (searcher while dumping Orcust on hand, searchable with Elpy or One for One), Allure of Darkness (draw, banished orcust card can be summoned with Wand or recycled with Galatea), One for One (extender while dumping Orcust in hand), Foolish Burial, Dragon Shrine (dump dragon), Ravine (dump both dragon and Orcust).

Extra Deck: Combo pieces/end board targets. Some cards like Savage, Unicorn, Beat Cop, and Dillingerous can be replaced.

Side Deck: Matchup specific.

Cards to think of: Armageddon Knight (dumper but relies on normal summon), Curious (dumper but hard to make if restricted to dark or dragon), Cyberse Quantum (great lv7 dark synchro but not a dragon, you can switch it with Savage), Silverokket (or other rokkets with nice utility effect, cant act as extender except from Quick Launch or Boot Sector Launch), ...

TESTING

Expected 1st turn:
<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/hIV8JGK.png"">https://i.imgur.com/hIV8JGK.png</a>

Going second:
<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/iDT5N1s.png"">https://i.imgur.com/iDT5N1s.png</a>
Negated once with opponent's Borrelend.

Pros: Can play through single target disruptions/handtraps. Big monsters, multiple negations, and protections first turn board. Otk easily going second and able to play grindy game using Orcust or Rokket Synchron.

Cons: Super Poly and Ra Sphere Mode food. Need extra thinking to play against wide/global effects like Nibiru, Dimension Shifter, Topologics, etc. Bad hand can end on mediocre board (see 2nd pic opponent)."

Keep your tributes for your ""Darkest Diablos, Lord of the Lair"" as your consistent special summon throughout the game to have that 3,000 ATK on the field as much as possible and for a possible chance in having both a poly and ""eternal soul"" for ""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"" for an unbreakable board. The drawing engine is weak but it's good enough for a good hand. If a bad hand is to happen dont worry, the deck is built to become adaptable to any given situation. But blame the game if you start off with ""reflection of endymion"" lmao.

As for the extra deck... go try hard if you'd like to be honest. The only thing to keep in mind is your ""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"" for its effects in both the field and the graveyard by summoning ""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"". I think you know where I'm going with this(wink wink)."

<h3><em>Comments:</em></h3>
This deck is EXTREMELY difficult to pilot. Not recommended to new players.

After a large amount of testing, I've managed to start optimizing the deck;

The first turn plan is more consistent with higher access to <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> than before; swapping to a Trinity on <a data-name=""Impcantation Pencilplume"">Impcantation Pencilplume</a> allows for a higher chance of getting to <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> (through Candle), while also providing the deck with an additional option for recursion in the lategame. In addition, the extra Plume allows us to perform the ""Altar OTK"", by Using <a data-name=""Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator"">Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator</a> to Summon 2 Pencils and 1 Candle, and then itself, for 9000 damage.

I played most of the more recent tournament without <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, and regretted it massively, siding both in every game. The option to go into rank 4s with Unicore and either Manju or a Candle (negated with Forbidden Chalice) was too important - that's not even mentioning how crucual sending n'tiss and herald is. I moved <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> to the sidedeck, since he was only really used as a defensive measure, which imps do well enough by themselves.

The set of 5 Monarch S/T to 3 monarchs means that <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> and <a data-name=""Pantheism of the Monarchs"">Pantheism of the Monarchs</a> are rarely dead (Ehther will almost always have something to summon - either kuraz into a pop 2, or Caius into a <a data-name=""Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand"">Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand</a>), and the Pantheism you send will then be able to search 1 of your 3 remaining ""Monarch"" S/Ts.

New side includes a <a data-name=""Demise, King of Armageddon"">Demise, King of Armageddon</a> package; it lets us play the free +1 that is Pre-Preparation of Rites, and works wonders against board-spam decks.

Her main strategy is to first gain card advantage while Summoning multiple ""Trickstar"" monsters, then use a combination of ""<a title=""Trickstar Light Stage (anime)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trickstar_Light_Stage_(anime)"">Trickster Light Stage</a>"" and ""<a title=""Trickstar Lycoris (anime)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trickstar_Lycoris_(anime)"">Trickstar Lycoris</a>"" to inflict effect damage to the opponent multiple times a turn, while powering up ""<a title=""Trickstar Holly Angel (anime)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trickstar_Holly_Angel_(anime)"">Trickstar Holly Angel</a>"" at the same time. <a title=""Ai"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ai"">Ai</a> describes her Duel style as ""poking with needles"". Her tactics also include quickly assembling different ""Trickstar"" cards to perform a variety of combos, which grew to include Fusion Summoning following her duel with Specter. By her own admission, the deck has low offensive power and has a weakness for being directly overpowered by opponents.

1 If you have a hand like this a dotscaper,cynet Mining, bitrooper, balancer lord, and a firewall guardian in your hand you first use cynet Mining to first discard the bitrooper to add a parallel eXceed by using cynet Mining then you use bitrooper graveyard effect to discard the dopscaper then you use dotscaper effect to special  summon it back from the graveyard then you normal summon a balancer lord then use his effect to summon firewall guardian then you do a link summon by just using firewall guardian to bring out link disciple then have to have a empty link zone for the firewall guardian to special summon back from the graveyard to that empty link zone but that's when you can triger parallel eXceed from you hand then before you summon you fire wall back you can special summon the eXceed then special summon back the firewall then use eXceed to special summon another one from your deck then you do a link 2 summon after when you do that that's  when you will link summon to transcode talker with a empty link zone this card is pointing then use his effect to special summon the  link 2 form you graveyard then you will use the link 2 and the remaining main monsters on the field to bring out powercode talker,encode talker, or excode talker then you have have one turn with 2  link 3 monster on the field.(this is a way you can get OTK finish if you go second and if you have cynet storm.)

This deck is very strong against powerful monsters or monsters who cannot be destroyed by battles or cards effects. Do a maximum of fusion summons using your oponent's monsters with predator counters as fusion materials (Lair of Darkness can be very useful for that too.) Synchro monsters can easily be summoned using Ophrys Scorpio + Banksiogre, and Instant Fusion can be used for summoning Thousand-Eyes Restrict for his effect and right after for summoning Dragostapelia on the field.

Magician's rod is the searcher to get the pieces needed for dark magician depending on what you already have.

Inspector border is there cause you want your opponent to use as little monster effects as possible. He may take up a normal summon but its a fair cost for a good effect.

Dark magical circle is for setting up the draw phases but you usually want to use that card last. Use the banish part of the effect to get rid of stuff on your opponent's field.

Secret village is great at stopping the opponent from playing assuming they don't have any spellcasters otherwise it's better to side out. Side note is make sure you can always have a spellcaster out there otherwise you will screw yourself

Card of demise, starting turn you want to set everything and use it. If you have inspector border then summon or magician rod summon and add illusion magic. Drawing 3 cards for free is ridiculous. And I've found playing magician with floodgates is the best way to go. And you want to make sure at min you are discarding 2 DM during your end phase.

Pot of duality is to try to get cards you already haven't used or to get cards needed for later.

Spellbook engine is a good engine, just more draw power to mill through the deck.

Illusion magic is meant to be used after you use card of demise so you can add two magician to discard and have your graveyard set up.

Dark magic expanded is honestly there to use the second effect and it's good. To protect your stuff from being destroyed is great.

Eye of timueas is great to bring out the extra deck magician for the situation. Dragon knight is great at protection and having another magician in the field/gravyard. Amulet dragon is for decks that recycle spell and trap cards from the graveyard so you can flat out banish them. Dark paladin is for dragon decks, that negating a spell card is always fun. Dark calvary is for more or less like amulet but if your opponent has a defense position monster its as good as game.

Foolish burial is to get a DM in the graveyard as soon as possible bit if all

Summoner art is if you haven't seen rod but need dark magician quick(can be replaced with upstart goblin)

Dark inheritance in to add whatever magician card you're missing.

Summon limit, no way your going to summon more than that except on really rare times.

Skill drain, stop those effects.

Solemn strike is to stop hand traps, monsters activating an effect or special summons.

Judgement the best no card

Eternal soul is the best card in the deck in my opimion, always special summoning a DM and they can't destroy it other than battle (or destoying the card) you have to protect the card at all costs

No much to say about the extra deck other than link spider is there if you have to make one dark magician work. And beat cop is to protect eternal soul once.

This deck's weaknesses are called by the grave(banish dark magician), evenly match, mst, unaffected by card effect monster/ can't be targeted, and monster stronger than 2500. You can still do stuff just makes it harder."

You want to OTK with the use of Nabla and a second body which could be One For One (Dotscraper), One-Time Passcode or Addition/Subtraction to tribute to summon Multiplication.

Then you can Gamiciel your opponent for a lot of dmg.

I:P is good for going first to surpass the restriction from Devotee to go for Avramax to stall your opponent one turn. Then you can make Magma to pop your enemy and boost Avramax for a grindgame maybe.

Foolish, One for One and Cynet Mining can use the sending effect to boost your Extradeck monster."

Neptabyss gains new valuable search targets. Deep sea Princess Prima Madonna can summon Mermai,"Deck notes below video here &gt; https://youtu.be/eCqXRKdpM_Q
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord"">Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord</a> - a card which makes you check how many waters you have in the graveyard all the time. Once you have 5 you can drop it and Kill 2 card out of your opponents hand. If mermail atlantean deck ever becomes meta this card ll be the first on a banlist radar. Searchable of Dragoons</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Gameciel Kaiju"">Gameciel Kaiju</a> - Going second water Kaiju,  great because your monsters have to discard waters also due to mooray of greed, can be re added back to hand</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssMegalo"">Mermail AbyssMegalo</a> - better then ever, him + neptabyss is a massive combo and prior to deep seas you needed more waters for such hand to be good. This card is really huge for the <strong>side deck</strong>, as he is abyss scale searcher and each scale is situationally great depending on the matchup</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssTeus"">Mermail AbyssTeus</a> - Superb card, searches typically gunde, triggers all your stuff by summoning himself. No complaints</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssPyke"">Mermail AbyssPyke</a> - Primadona (new lvl 7 deep sea synchro) Summons this boi so more cruical then ever.</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssGunde"">Mermail AbyssGunde</a> - if this discarded (which even deep sea Minstrel can nowdays do you can revive another mermail)</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lappis Dragon"">Lappis Dragon</a> - If searched by Dragoons or drawn of Coral Dragon, Desires, Mooray you can ss him. He is level 5 water turn which can be brought back with Marincess link to. Synchro him into Primadonna by reviving the level 2 Deep Sea Sentry.</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Atlantean Dragoons"">Atlantean Dragoons</a> - superb card, not once per turn and with Deep sea sentry adding it back you can keep discarding it and re using it.</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Atlantean Marskman"">Atlantean Marskman</a> - Just 1 this card is hyper searchable. Abyss Teus searches it through Abyss Pyke, super searchable neptabyss does to..</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Atlantean heavy infantry"">Atlantean heavy infantry</a> - Going second card pops face up cards when discarded for water monsters effect. This includes mermail link so you can abuse this during opponents turn. Also additional normal summon can matter even for deep seas</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Neptabyss, the atlantean prince"">Neptabyss, the atlantean prince</a> - prince needs no introduction</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Deep Sea Minstrel&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Deep Sea Minstrel</strong> </a>- 1 IS ALL YOU NEED. HYPER HYPER HYPER searchable, just as searchable as antlantean marksman. Maybe in Marincess arcehtype you would run more but here just 1. Anti handtrap deep sea monster</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deep Sea Sentry""><strong>Deep Sea Sentry</strong></a>- my favorite - as that way Dragoons gains another worthy discard target while prior to that he only had neptabyss. (neptabyss when discarded revives kinda relevant). Handloops, also correct level with Lappis Dragon for new synchro</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a> - limited to 1 and tbh neptabyss is more resiliant normal summon anyway. as long as this card ain't banned it doesn't truly matter the number she is at</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fishborg Launcher"">Fishborg Launcher</a> - LL get better as the time goes on. Helps you go into trishula and other synchros as well as links. Fiber target</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Crystal Girl"">Crystal Girl </a>- Decent discard, sort of delayed card, just valuable enough be the 40th card</li>
</ul>
Spells
<ul>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> 4th neptabyss</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Mooray of greed"">Mooray of greed</a> - consistency (triggers lappis to)</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""pot of desires"">pot of desires</a> - consistency (its hard to mess up this deck with desires)</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deep sea Aria"">Deep sea Aria</a> - banish a water search... any sea searpent, Best card in the deck</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Abyss-Scale of the Mizuchi"">Abyss-Scale of the Mizuchi</a> - spell negator, stops super poly even. The deck loses to new storm / raigeki so why not. The other abyss-scales are good to, they should all be in between your main and side deck, the one you main is format dependent. You can equip it to link 2 mermail.</li>
 	<li>1x Ash blossom</li>
 	<li>1x Ghost ogre snow rabbit - works with fiber</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Extra deck
<ul>
 	<li>Needlefiber summon fishborg launcher / ghost ogre snow rabbit</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Mermail Abyssalacia"">Mermail Abyssalacia</a> - disruption with atlantean marskman / infantry, grind card</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Mastar boy"">Mastar boy</a> - sometimes you wanna cross Fiber / Marincess link into abyssalacia this card helps with that</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone </a>- revives deep sea cards</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Bahamut shark"">Bahamut shark</a> - Summon that toad (could be dweller instead)</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Toadally awesome"">Toadally awesome</a> - you don't even have to run frogs for him ;) Btw Swap frogs don't trigger atlanteans / deep seas</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Mermail abyssgaios"">Mermail abyssgaios </a>- running mender and v.f.d is disrespectful to this card. Its an amazing card.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> - desert locust + level 4, Double big beater</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - LOL,,, handlooop (desert locust + level 2)</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna"">Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna</a> - yeah a new card which isn't the easiest thing to summon but you can watch a vid, I found some combos</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a> - sometimes you climb into donna with it so a free draw. decent card triggrs atlanteans.. pops</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Desert Locust"">Desert Locust</a> - some more handloops hi fiber</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""White Aura Whale"">White Aura Whale</a> - Some monster field nuke</li>

This is a rather short living deck, so you have to win fast, because there aren't any cards in it to get cards from GY/banished zone back. Side deck is to adjust the counters depending on the opponent. I recommend not to really go over 40/45 cards because it can happen that you can't really do anything with a bad hand, and including hand traps (Ash Blossom &amp; Co.) isn't really necessary."

Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.

A good budget deck with some nice techs.,"My new Tenyi Deck, post Ignition Assault. It's mostly a going first deck, but it's something between combo and control. You wanna bring either the Draco Master +  Berserker of the Tenyi or Monk + Draco Berserker on the field. Skilldrain is an awesome card, because you don't need most of your effects on the field, because the Tenyi trigger in the GY or hand. The Blue Eyes Ultimate is just for Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi.
Waterfall of the Dragons, is your best draw card. Just throw up on of your Tenyi and draw 2 cards. Lost wind  is just one of my favourite current cards. It's awesome for going first, and very often saves your ass.

&nbsp;

Avramax and Unicorn are actually cards I use very rarely. They can probably go out for something different. They were just inside because of the scapegoat combo, wich comes also very rarely in this deck. Maybe a Borreload Savage Dragon would be an good option, but he's to expensive for me. By the way, this deck is very cheap."

This is done by getting treasure panda to get them on the field and using wonder wand and white elephant's gift. Then you use backup soldier to get the pieces out of the grave. This sometimes takes a couple turns so there are many search cards and hand resets in here to increase chances.

Kevin Bortle's discovery of including mystic mine in this deck is amazing. I was already using the Utopia play with it, but using mystic mine and sitting on sera or even tributing your board with Frozen Rose, just to OTK your next turn is brilliant. Mystic Mine with with Demise of land can save this deck in so many situations and is too good not to take advantage of (despite the hate) IMO.

<strong>Ok, why Sky Striker?</strong>

Red Reboot beats this deck. Mystic mine and demise of land help work around that, but I found the deck could still use more draw power (or any for that matter) and more quick play spells for support. After tinkering, Sky Striker seems to be the solution.  Using Engage to add and set a live Widow, and sometimes drawing a card after, is insane, and the consistency of adding a solid negate turn one provides the deck with much needed support in the harshest of Red Reboot times.

Another issue with pure Traptrix decks is the lack of Traptrix monsters. The Sky Striker cards facilitate that void by creating semi tough monsters through hornet drones, which can be searched via Engage, and then function similarly first turn as Traptrix Sera, making the back row support always effective.

<strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton?</strong>

This card just make the OTK that much more possible, and allows you to make those XYZ plays while sometimes simultaneously outing their Avramax, Fantasmay, or W/E. You can even use this card to lock your opponent out of the Extra Monster Zone entirely, <em>Pretty Sweet. </em>

<strong>Insta Fusion is the Spice.</strong>

Insta Fusion for me is either another lvl 4 monster that wont get destroyed or a nice relinquish that helps me out second turn. This card is really good, and is too free RN not to use."

No worry, pure Striker can still draw with Bamboos while having the advantage of consistent 1st turn board Apollousa+backr","Another Sky Striker build (pure-ish) using Bamboo Swords as draw power. If Engage got hit on f/l list, then you can replace it with more bamboos. If it doesnt get limited/banned, well, enjoy having Apollousa+backrows+billions cards in hand AND otk next turn using Gearfried+Borrelsword.

We use Isolde to summon Apollousa. I will explain the Isolde combo using Ex-Paladin (fire warrior). Before normal summoning Ex-Paladin, it's preferable to resolve your Sky Striker Hornet Drones first. Normal summon Ex-Paladin, activate, equip Tune Knight (from deck/hand), ss Tune Knight (dont use its effect), ss Isolde, add God Phoenix Gearfried, send Cursed Bamboo, ss Flame Noble Knight Renaud, activate Renaud chain Cursed Bamboo, add Golden Bamboo from deck and Cursed Bamboo from GY. To summon Apollousa, we need one more extender, thats why we're playing cards like Hornet and Roze (sky striker extenders), 2-3 Renaud (1 summon from isolde, the rest is extender), One for One, RotA, Monster Reborn, Living Fossil (equip for Isolde requirement, extender), and Area Zero (extender if destroyed).

The rest are just Sky Striker cards, Bamboos (2 Cursed, 2-3 Golden, 1 Bamboo Sword), and the backrow lineup (I used Trap Trick+Threatening Roar to prevent getting otk'd, another reason is cus most generic big link monsters like borreload, borrelsword, bls, and avramax are online while atking, so we use Threatening Roar to stun them and force them to play grind game cus we play striker anyway or we can otk them next turn).

Extra Deck: 1-2 Borrelsword, 1-2 Apollousa, 2 Isolde, Sky Strikers, and Linkuriboh (from double Renaud for summoning Apollousa and from Hornet token for summoning Borrelsword). The rest are just generics.

Well look no further let me introduce y,"Combos &amp; Deck up against meta &gt; <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E"">https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E</a>      <strong>Card ratio explanations below </strong>
<ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The deck has 30 Igknights, Open 3 and you have a full combo (showed in a video, prior to Renaud 3 Igknights did nothing you needed 4), Igknights offer resiliancy, follow up play and high consistency. Due to Pendulum mechanic, Even cards like Malicious are good draws with Igknights</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">9 Normal summons: Connector = ftk, vyon = ftk, Summoner monk is a combo piece but since he can net you vyon pseudo ftk starter, ROTA = FTK, Rabbit + any Igknight = ftk (there are probably more rabbit combinations)). Armageddon knight by itself is not an ftk wierdly enough. Isolde</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">In a nutshell if you can make Isolde you got an FTK and its SUPER DUPER JUPER EASY TO MAKE ISOLDE EASIER THEN EVER</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Half an Isolde (all super searchable) - Renaud, Red Layer, Gearfried (granted he is a boss monster primarly)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Cards which Arma sends - Zephyros, Summoner monk, Destrudo, Malicious, PK boots. All can be pend summoned (apart from destrudo). Average dark warrior / Isolde turbo decklists desperately tries to loop arma knight. THIS DECK does it with ease, in average you are summoning Isolde without normal summon so you can literally bounce back ARMA with zepyhros and then normal summon him (Heck often times you don't evne have to NS him you can pend him). I even debated not needing Power Tool and so many D.D.Rs, but those cards make the deck more resiliant to disruption so eh.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">1 Rank up spell (doesn't matter which sadly, we found a brick oh no... Zexal is worth it)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">7 Equips including 3 d.d.r for powertool and 4 equips for Isolde (No need for more Powertool arma loop is often times not needed). Axe of fools can bait cards and then be re-added back with renaud to bait more stuff (often times you have to drop renaud early so relevant). D.D.R gets reused often due to renaud / zephyros / power tool, Moon mirror is there to keep an equip count steady**, Phoenix blade Enables summoner monk (often twice), d.d.r (often twice), Gearfried, Knightmare Gryphon (Core combo), Knightmare phoenix, Knightmare Unicorn, aqua dolphin (rare), zephyros (rare)**</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rescue Ferret normaly summons L3 Igknight + PK boots / 2 level 4 Igknights. I am not running combo bricks for Ferret in this build (got an infinite negate igknight video in which i run bulb doppel steam the cloak for him)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rebarian shark. Revives the dugares, stack the Rank - up, draw it with Gryphon &gt; UTOPIC ZEXAL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Boots + Brigadine is in the deck because it allows arma loop to turn into a R4, also for Ferret. The main combo summons 2 R4 (Dugares the timeless, classic utopia for zexal) so its relevant. Brigadine is classically good Isolde father, boots can be pend summoned, normal summoned... since the main Pendulum warrior into Isolde way doesn't NS)</p>

<ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Selene endymion link revives the summoner monk. (Monk summons ferret &amp; Vyon)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The deck does have a downside, it can't stop imperm, chalice on Zexal because it can't afford to make Trigate on top of all the wombo combo stuff I do, I also can't bring dragster often enough so I don't run him (would be 16th card). Also lack of handtraps GAME1</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><strong class=""_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU"">Isolde searches a scale... which is half a fire warrior search. Isolde + any scale is pend summon to... Running double isolde because they wanna stop the first effect to.</strong></p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">No called by the grave because starters / extender at high count are better</p>
</li>

Want to re abuse Summoner monk? Want a powerful warrior build with frightening consistency? Well look no further let me introduce y,"Combos &amp; Deck up against meta &gt; <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E"">https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E</a>      <strong>Card ratio explanations below </strong>
<ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The deck has 30 Igknights, Open 3 and you have a full combo (showed in a video, prior to Renaud 3 Igknights did nothing you needed 4), Igknights offer resiliancy, follow up play and high consistency. Due to Pendulum mechanic, Even cards like Malicious are good draws with Igknights</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">9 Normal summons: Connector = ftk, vyon = ftk, Summoner monk is a combo piece but since he can net you vyon pseudo ftk starter, ROTA = FTK, Rabbit + any Igknight = ftk (there are probably more rabbit combinations)). Armageddon knight by itself is not an ftk wierdly enough. Isolde</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">In a nutshell if you can make Isolde you got an FTK and its SUPER DUPER JUPER EASY TO MAKE ISOLDE EASIER THEN EVER</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Half an Isolde (all super searchable) - Renaud, Red Layer, Gearfried (granted he is a boss monster primarly)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Cards which Arma sends - Zephyros, Summoner monk, Destrudo, Malicious, PK boots. All can be pend summoned (apart from destrudo). Average dark warrior / Isolde turbo decklists desperately tries to loop arma knight. THIS DECK does it with ease, in average you are summoning Isolde without normal summon so you can literally bounce back ARMA with zepyhros and then normal summon him (Heck often times you don't evne have to NS him you can pend him). I even debated not needing Power Tool and so many D.D.Rs, but those cards make the deck more resiliant to disruption so eh.</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">1 Rank up spell (doesn't matter which sadly, we found a brick oh no... Zexal is worth it)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">7 Equips including 3 d.d.r for powertool and 4 equips for Isolde (No need for more Powertool arma loop is often times not needed). Axe of fools can bait cards and then be re-added back with renaud to bait more stuff (often times you have to drop renaud early so relevant). D.D.R gets reused often due to renaud / zephyros / power tool, Moon mirror is there to keep an equip count steady**, Phoenix blade Enables summoner monk (often twice), d.d.r (often twice), Gearfried, Knightmare Gryphon (Core combo), Knightmare phoenix, Knightmare Unicorn, aqua dolphin (rare), zephyros (rare)**</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rescue Ferret normaly summons L3 Igknight + PK boots / 2 level 4 Igknights. I am not running combo bricks for Ferret in this build (got an infinite negate igknight video in which i run bulb doppel steam the cloak for him)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rebarian shark. Revives the dugares, stack the Rank - up, draw it with Gryphon &gt; UTOPIC ZEXAL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Boots + Brigadine is in the deck because it allows arma loop to turn into a R4, also for Ferret. The main combo summons 2 R4 (Dugares the timeless, classic utopia for zexal) so its relevant. Brigadine is classically good Isolde father, boots can be pend summoned, normal summoned... since the main Pendulum warrior into Isolde way doesn't NS)</p>

<ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Selene endymion link revives the summoner monk. (Monk summons ferret &amp; Vyon)</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The deck does have a downside, it can't stop imperm, chalice on Zexal because it can't afford to make Trigate on top of all the wombo combo stuff I do, I also can't bring dragster often enough so I don't run him (would be 16th card). Also lack of handtraps GAME1</p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM""><strong class=""_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU"">Isolde searches a scale... which is half a fire warrior search. Isolde + any scale is pend summon to... Running double isolde because they wanna stop the first effect to.</strong></p>
</li>
 	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"">
<p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">No called by the grave because starters / extender at high count are better</p>
</li>

The deck surrounds it's an entire strategy around Crystron Needlefiber(or habquilifax if you want to go by it's TCG name). the reason why needle fiber is in the deck is that it is, in my opinion, the best engine to give kuribohs the boost that they need without going into any chaos shinanigans. the new card Generation Next is also a VERY good extender for kuribohs because one it allows the deck to extend more if you are picking up what I'm putting down. all jokes aside though, the card is really good and is a very easy substitute for Mimiclay which is a card that I was using in my previous build. anyway, the deck was really fun to build and I really enjoyed playing it. IDK for some reason, I enjoy chucking my hairy balls at my opponent. but anyway enough about my disturbing fetishes, i hope you guys enjoy my deck."
