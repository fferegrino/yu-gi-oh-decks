Here we play techs to ensure spam to get access to a solid offensive board, and struggle against common aggro deck weaknesses like consistant backrows.  &nbsp;  So the monster engine countains the better Cyber Dragon monsters to spam the board and add consistancy to our starting hands. The original Cyber Dragon can special summon itsel from the hand if starting second and is the key monster of the loops due to it's name and level 5. Cyber Dragon Core is an amazing starter that sports the name Cyber Dragon on the field and in the graveyard like it's comrades to enable tuto spells to trigger easily, and can tuto a Cyber Dragon spell/trap when normal summoned to gain access to all our combos. It can restart boards in case of a non-successfull first turn by banishing itsel from the graveyard to special summon from the deck. Cyber Dragon Herz is the better discard target of the deck, since it can search or recycle a Cyber Dragon to keep our ressources up, and can more occasionnaly become level 5 when special summoned. Cyber Dragon Nachster pairs perfectly with Herz by discarding a monster to special summon itself then special summon a machine with 2100 Atk or Def from the graveyard, meaning Cyber Dragon and most of the extra deck.  Lastly Galaxy Soldier is usefull to summon xyz 5 monsters and is a free extra deck summon paired with Herz effect, and Jizukiru, The Star Destroying Kaiju will be a searchable tech to bypass Dangerous monsters with great stats/protection effect/disruption effect. Ash Blossom soften the going second match ups by negating a tuto and so restrainig the opponent's board.  &nbsp;  The spell and traps package is designed to develop the spam potential and ensure OTKs. Cyber Emergency and Cyber Repair Plant are must have cards that trigger a tuto effect to search all monsters of the deck and instantly gain access to starters/extenders/kaiju. Cyber Revsystem acts like a rebirn for Cyber Dragon and will be usefull to finish a board by summoning Cyber Dragon Sieger on a Qliphort Genius. Lastly Machine Duplication is an amazing extender that will automatically summon 2 Cyber Dragon from the deck since the little Cyber Dragon monsters gains the name ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field, we have a free link summon or xyz 5 summon.  To add consistancy we play Pot Of Desires to draw 2 cards almost freely and gain numerous options to better OTK. One For One will summon a monster by discarding another, so it can create card advantage thanks to Herz and enable explosive starts.  To fusion summon Cyber Dragons, Overload Fusion will banish monsters from the graveyard to fusion summon and wil pair well with Cyberload Fusion that can use banished monsters, these two cards consisting on a great OTK potential when played together.  To add defense we have Called By The Grave that protects our starters from monster hand traps, and Twin Twisters to break through backrows and take down fatal floodgates like There Can Be Only One or Monarch Erupt/Skill Drain.  &nbsp;  To absorb the countereffect of Cyber Dragon Nachster, the extra deck countains 14 machine monsters. Qliphort Genius can pressure a negate on the field and free 2 extra zones to assemble great boards. Cyber Dragon Sieger can give 2100 Atk to a Cyber Dragon monster to gain access to powerfull OTKs and protect key monsters from opponent's battlephases.  Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon acts like a pseudo kaiju to break powerfull monsters placed in the extra zone like Apollousa to build your boards more easily. Chimeratech Fortress Dragon can be used as a beatstick in critical situations, but most notably fuse the opponent's board, being a threat for decks like Orcusts and other Cyber Dragons. Chimeratech Rampage Dragon is the main offensive threat, it breaks backrow and gain access to 3 attacks by discarding key monsters from the deck like Herz and Core being a triple 4200 Atk monster thanks to Sieger. Cyber Twin Dragon is an alternative to Otk with a potential 4900 dual attack.  Cyber Dragon Nova is easy to summon and can revive a Cyber Dragon plus boost one of it's comrades, he is equally the slap target of Cyber Dragon Infinity that absorb attack position monsters and give a great neagtion effect to the board to protect OTKs and pressure opponent's turns.  Lastly Constellar Pleiades is an alternative before using Nachster effect to bounce cards and disrupt opponent's board, and Salamangreat Almiraj is a fair way to have a monster in the graveyard to trigger Cyber Repair Plant and protect an Infinity when starting first."

Eternal soul and Magician's navigation is more for if you already have a Dark Magician in hand and a Dark Magical Circle on the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician can be ran at either 2 or 3, its at 3 though because of Magician's naviagtion and spellbook of knowledge spellbook of Knowledge can also be ran at 2 or 3, or even 1 as its more of a situational card, but 2 would be best for the deck Inari Fire is at 2 for the link material, though you can only control 1 it makes for a good turn 1 summon, and even as a defence if you need it Curtian is in there as a free summon + circle, but can be used as apprentice discard for cost Illusion Magic works well with a Magican's navigation, or a Eternal soul. Best used with Circle on field The Extra deck is a BIT random, mainly the link monsters but you can switch out some of the Xyz monsters for another Ebon Illusion or Ebon High. Normally with The Eye Of Timaeus you want to go into Dark Magican the dragon knight, to protect your backrow and as a free removal with Dark Magical Circle Magician of dark illusion is a good combo with the traps or even a quick-play, as long as it isnt during the damage step. you can summon it in defence position to protect your lifepoints and banish a card if you have Magic Circle on the field"

Since this deck has high field swarming (yes Nibiru is a concern) I thought of using Guardragon Elpy to summon out Rafale, Champion Fur Hire from the Deck. Now you may be thinking how will you summon Elpy with no level 4 Dragons. Well just dump Destrudo to the Graveyard, but make sure you have Beat on the field to make destrudo a level 4. I have been trying to keep this deck going in locals, but with a tight budget to get cards I need is rough. Luckily Duel Devistastor released and I now have access to cards that I needed for a cheaper price. So with all this said I am gonna be testing out this theory of the deck. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

A good budget deck with some awesome techs.,"My new Tenyi Deck, post Ignition Assault. It's mostly a going first deck. You wanna bring either the Draco Master +  Berserker of the Tenyi or Monk + Draco Berserker on the field. Skilldrain is an awesome card, because you don't need most of your effects on the field, because the Tenyi trigger in the GY or hand. The Blue Eyes Ultimate is just for Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Waterfall of the Dragons, is your best draw card. Just throw up on of your Tenyi and draw 2 cards. Lost wind  is just one of my favourite current cards. It's awesome for going first, and very often saves your ass.  &nbsp;  Avramax and Unicorn are actually cards I use very rarely. They can probably go out for something different. They were just inside because of the scapegoat combo, wich comes also very rarely in this deck. Maybe a Borreload Savage Dragon would be an good option, but he's to expensive for me. By the way, this deck is very cheap."

This deck has a high OTK potential while testing the deck I went 10-0 thanks to building big boards easily and people not really knowing what to do against Magister (at least the people I went against). A combo I found useful was to use the effect of Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm from the grave or normal summon to get a Supreme King Gate Zero from the deck. Then placing the Gate in the pendulum zone along with Servant, Chronograph, or Endymion. You can use the effect of Chronograph in the Pendulum Zone to special summon Timegazer to the field and replace the Chronograph with any other pendulum you want and then special summon with the Pendulum Zones. You can then summon Electrumite and use its effect to discard then to discard and add to hand. The second effect should be Master Cerberus or Endymion and then add them back to your hand. You can then Pendulum summon to swarm the field and summon Borrelsword and use its effect so it can attack twice which should be enough to finish off your opponent."

It seemed very competitive.  As it turned out, this deck was quite easy for me to get used to. It took me a lot less time than it's taking for me to learn decks like Thunder Dragon and Sky Striker. I've used this deck quite a lot now in Singles, and the occasional Matches in tournaments. I can see how this deck can be very annoying to play against, but at the same time I think I could really enjoy playing against this deck. Being able to beat a defensive board like this deck can set up can be very satisfying."

Shaddoll engine is usable in a fair amount of decks, here we go with a combination of 4 engines that can lock the opponent or just OTK with Artifacts, Invokeds and Mekk-Knights.  So the strategy is to set a board using the combo with Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star to countain opponent's monster effects and back it up with Invoked monsters like Mechaba and Artifacts like Scythe if having Artifact Sanctum or a way to summon Artifacts from the graveyard. When going second, the idea is to abuse of Mekk-Knight engine and Shaddoll Fusion's full power effect to set a solid OTK board that can bypass most of boards when having sufficient ressources.  &nbsp;  So the monster engines are quite specific due to the presence of 4 archetypes. The shaddoll engine countains Shaddoll Beast, Shaddoll Dragon and Shaddoll Hedgehog to respectively draw, destroy backrow and tuto other shaddoll cards when sent to the graveyard by a card effect, meaning that you can use Shaddoll Fusion at his full potential when going second, and even Invocation if not having the Shaddoll Fusion. It is usefull to create card advantage while setting the basics of your boards, or just contribute to lock the opponent when finishing a going first turn with El Shaddoll Winda and El Shaddoll Grysta.  The artifacts are reduced to 2 Artifact Scythe and Artifact Moralltach to avoid bricks but have fair chances to have one paired with Artifact Ignition. They special summon themselves when destroyed from the spell and trap zones and trigger an effect if it was during the opponent's turn, the first one locking the extra deck and the second destroying a card on the field. They contribute to countain opponent's board when starting first to better OTK and are materials for the summon of El Construct Shaddoll and Invoked Mechaba. Be aware that since they set themselves in the backrow, they can help the summon f the Mekk-Knight monsters so you can spam more easily.  Invoked engine of course is reduced to Aleister The Invoker, and gains power thanks to Salamangreat Almiraj that can use the normal summoned Aleister to directly enable the summon of Mekk-Knight monsters when going first and have an Aleister in the graveyard to fully use Invocation. They also can give a +1000/1000 boost for any fusion monster to survive some battle phases or perform  OTKs with offensive threats like Invoked Purgatrio.  Finally the Mekk-Knight engine goes for 3 Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, 2 Mekk-knight Blue Sky, 1 Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse and 1 Mekk-Knight Red Moon. Purple can tuto by banishing himself or another Mekk-Knight, meaning that you will be ensured to have an Invoked Mechaba when going first, and a monster that will come back for the next turn to search Blue and spam the board. Blue Sky tuto an equal amount of cards that are in the opponent's side of it's column to search the entire engine and rapidly get access to threats like Borrelsword Dragon. Indigo moves the Mekk-Knight to liberate zones for more summons and is the master piece of the control combo of going first games. Lastly Red can destroy monsters of the same column by banishing a Mekk-Knight of the graveyard and can enable OTKs by cutting annoying monsters in defense position or with some defensive effects.  &nbsp;  The spell and traps packages is designed to soften the statistics and enabling the most spam potential for defensive first turns or offensive second turns. The invoked engine countains 3 Magical Meltdown to protect monster effects and tuto Aleister, and Invocation to summon Invoked fusion monsters using Aleister from the graveyard and some monsters in opponent's graveyard to limitate some decks like Cyber Dragon by striking key monsters. Invocation can come back in the deck from the graveyard to recycle banished Aleisters and generate defensive plays or more spam plays. Lastly The Book Of The Law can fusion simmon an Invoked monster by using another on the field in rapid effect to protect your monsters from destruction or extend battle phases to gain access to easier OTKs.  The Artifact engine countains 2 Artifact Ignition and 3 Artifact Sanctum. Ignition can destroy a spell or trap card in rapid effect to set an artifact in the backrow zones directly from the deck and cycle it, this is usefull to suppress annoying cards of the opponent or just trigger set Artifact monster's effects during the opponent's turn. Artifact Sanctum summons an Artifact monster directly from the deck and can search Scythe to lock the extra deck and punish a lot of meta decks or just summon a Moralltach to destroy a card in specific match ups like Dark Magician and True Draco to catch an Eternal Soul or a Dragonic Diagram  World Legacy Cards allows more consistancy. World Legacy Succession reborns a monster in a link zone to abuse of fusion monsters effects or spam the board, and World Legacy's Secret can lock some decks when going first thanks to it's ability to be searched out by Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star to negate several monsters effect in combination with Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse or just reborn an Artifact Scythe used for the fusion summon of Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll fusion is an excellent card for going second match ups since the opponent will almost always ends his turn with an extra deck monster, meaning that you'll be able to fusion summon an El Shaddoll monster using materials directly from the deck to trigger cards like Shaddoll Beast or Shaddoll Dragon to cycle your hand or suppress annoying backrow cards like Monarch Erupt. The El Shaddoll monster will consist on a link material for the summon of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness and will recycle the Shaddoll fusion when sent to the graveyard to gain a free discard target for Invoked Mechaba or Aleister The Invoker Of Madness effects.  Lastly to bypass most annoying boards when going second, we use 2 Mind Control And Instant Fusion to steal opponent's monsters and use them as link materials and gain access to higher link monsters more easily or just pressure the opponent's board by forcing out negates.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is made to use the full potential of fusion spaming effects with the Aleister The Invoker Of Madness engine. The shaddol engine countains 2 El Shaddoll Construct to maximise the card advantage generated by the Shaddoll Monsters discarded from the deck, 1 El Shaddoll Grysta to pressure boards in specific configurations by striking a special summon, and El Sheddol Winda to restrain the opponent to 1 special summon per turn and completely lock decks in combination with the Artifact engines and monsters like Invoked Mechaba.  The Invoked Engine plays Invoked Caliga to start boards with Instant Fusion in case of poor hand when starting first by preparing a target for Invoked Elysium, and can just contribute to fully lock opponent's first turn before setting an OTK. Invoked Mechaba can negate one card per turn and banish it, privating the opponents of destruction effects or secondary effects in the graveyard. Invoked Purgatrio is an axcellent finisher that gains rapidly Atk Following the size of the opponent's board, being a monster that can attack all monsters in the same battle phase with piercing damage. Lastly Invoked Elysium consume more ressources but consists on a formidable weapon against decks like Thunder Dragon by banihing all opponents board with himself or an Invoked monster of the graveyard.  Thousand-Eyes Restrict is a target for Instant Fusion when going second, it can steal annoying monsters and beatsticks. By equiping them to itself, it acts like a free starter for the summon of Mekk-Knight monsters.  Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star builds consistant board for going first games by setting a board that can negate 2 monster's effects and is hard to bypass by battle. Aleister The Invoker Of Madness is easy to summon thanks to the fair number of different types and attributes of monsters of the deck and acts like a spaming fusion machine for OTK boards.  Lastly Borreload dragon is an option to bypass the most resilient monsters and Borrelsword dragon is a good OTK generator if not using the Aleister The Invoker Of Madness combo.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The side deck :  Since this deck is already consistant when going first, the biggest part of the extra deck is designed to soften going second match ups.  Nibiru, the primal being is a Deadly weapon against combo decks like Guardragons that will able solid otks and add a free material for the summon of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness on our board.  Twin Twisters is a good way of Breaking backrow cards that can be annoying if there are too much stacked. It can also discard some cards like the Shaddoll monsters to generate a little card advantage.  A third Mind Control will be usefull against decks like Thuder Dragon that runs Colossus, a threat that lock effects of key cards like Aleister The Invoker.  Artifact Lancea is a searchable card to disable decks like Orcust, and can be used as fusion material for Invoked Mechaba and El Shaddoll Artifact.  Super Polymerization and Starving Venom Fusion Dragon can stop decks by suppressing 2 key monsters of a loop and generate a beatstick that will enable quick summoning of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness next turn.  Lastly Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order could seem couterproductive, but if starting first they can completely shut down Pendulums and Sky Strikers, specially in combination with our first turn board. In the worst cases, they can be used as cost for our monsters effects."

He brought his new friends to show the world what he can do!,"I found this deck in a status update on Dueling Book. It seemed like a lot of fun to play, so I imported the deck. I've only made very minor changes since.  This deck isn't very strong, nor is it that consistent. However, if some of the cards work together and your opponent doesn't have disruption cards, you can bring out cards like Toadally Awesome and the 'Borrel' Link Monsters. Pretty fancy I'd say, for a Frog that was never allowed to play with the other Frogs.  Since recording the duel video that I used this deck in, I realized that Wetlands could be a very nice card to use in this deck. I will likely include that when I use this deck again. Would that happen in a duel video, then I will edit this list as well. For now, it's in the Side Deck."

For each 100-500 more than 8000 your opponent has just add 1 extra spell counter. They have 9000 from Upstart? 17 (+1 from Tempest Magician =18)  Kinda stally but overall not the hardest thing to pull off!  Citadel and Magical Exemplar are huge staples, Exemplar gets 2 spell counters for each spell played, and with Citadel out if its destroyed they go to Citadel.  You wanna use the very small Spellbook engine In the deck to draw 2 off one normal summon, or 1 special summon if you have the cards you need in your hand already and you summon Prophecy via Magician's Circle."

The main goal of this deck is to break your opponent's board with the effect of the dangers and generate resources with them and otk with the link monsters with a high atk.  It's important to you go second, so you can stop your opponent in the middle of the combo with nibiru or slowing his combo with veiler, to easily break his board with bigfoot, levianeer, the knightmares or any other link monster available.  I've put this deck as ""meta deck"", but i don't actually know how to rank it, but this deck can break some strong fields i think the meta deck rank is the best for it, being at least tier 2, but really funny and fair to play.  &nbsp;"

Hey, i wanted to update the deck as I have keep it playing it and keep on winning with it. the deck is now updated to fight the pandemic and almost all the meta decks.  the whole deck itselfs recycle with every other card, the dark spirits recover themselves when any big unleashed goes to grave, they are almost the best card in deck still but sarama i think its now the best card as it lets you recover every other spell or trap card! so the whole deck never runs out of cards. Amazing defense at the expense of nothing, with supply squad the opponent will be too worried of either hand trap or the unleashed monsters to destroy them so they can become a +2 easily, forbidden dropplet is an exit for established fields like pendulums or hero, cyberse and almost all the decks that rely on one card, side deck is mostly against anything on the meta, nibiru mostly for spam decks."

Alpha can search both Berserkion and Valkyrion from deck to hand when summoned and doki doki can summon alpha from deck to get that search.

Nibiru obviously is a worry, but Rafale can stop it. Mind Control is amazing in the deck. For example you open with 2 fur hire monsters and need a 3rd type to go into folgo. Well mind control takes care of that. I found that the ratio of 2 fire Formation Tenki and 1 ROTA have come in handy many times. I have drawn a hand of all spells and traps but somehow managed to have 1 Tenki and ROTA. Which allowed me to go into a full Fur Hire combo."

Then it turned into a pet project of mine. I’ve fine tuned it and it performed well at locals, obviously it struggled against the top decks like Salamangreats and Orcust but all in all I feel like it did well for it just being a casual deck.  Basically you want to see Rescue Rabbit turn one. If you don’t; Unexpected Dai works as a backdoor opener. Both is even better. You want to do some Electrumite plays, usually targeting Hallohallo, for some synchro plays. If your going first, you want to end with a Apollousa, Dawn Dragster, and Borreload Savage ideally. Sometimes all it can muster is two of the three, which is fine.  If you are going second, which is better with this deck imo, you want to use the Utopia Double package for big damage. Also you could work in a level 8 synchro to augment what little life points your opponent would have left. Otherwise you can cheese number 82 for game.  I like this deck a lot, it really have the versatility to deal with just about any situation. Which is why I side Black-Winged dragon for the occasional burn deck. Obviously it’s not a top tier deck, and it bricks if you draw all vanillas or the “garnet” double or nothing. I’ve experimented with the side cards for a more control based strategy but it’s even more inconsistent. I tried out some Igknights and even took royal magical library for a spin, no dice. If you guys have any suggestions I’d love to hear them. This deck has become my side Yugioh project and I’d love to somehow make it more viable than my Altergeist deck. Which is doubtful but I’m having fun with it."

Other options the deck can go into is making use of the nephthys link 3 monster to create an indestructible beatstick which can remain on the field indefinitely and can be used as cost for some of the monsters effects in the deck such as fire king ganesha and cerulean sacred phoenix of nephthys. One last major late game option is link climbing using rekindling on the decks fire kings to easily go into the link 4's of the deck, namely topologic bomber dragon to once again nuke the field continuously.

I know that the latest red-eyes support as come out so i decided to try and make a deck out of the new card since it is really good and i mean REALLY good! This is the deck that i found the most success with in terms of making this a pure red-eyes build and i must say the deck actually does pretty well against other decks. the idea for this is to either go first or second(it doesn't really matter but first is prefered) and essentially create a board full of interruptions that your opponent will be forced to play through. normal you do have ask blossom or some kind of hand that will allow you to negate your opponents effects. the deck is not necessarily suppose to stop your opponent rather slow it down so the deck can keep up with your opponents speed. as i was play testing the deck, it use to be just a slash dragon pass deck and maybe with fang with chain on the board. this deck does a similar thing except you summon ""Dragun of Red-eyes"" and then set a trap or two. those traps usually being fang with chain or some other disruption card. yes i know you cant target dragun, but even then your end result should still have at least one or two disruptions since you also have a chance of having ash blossom in your hand as well. pot of desires and allure of darkness are also there to boost the consistency since red-eyes seem to have an issue with it as well. so now the question is, what so i think about the deck so far? well to bee honest the new support is absolutely amazing and is a good first turn board not only providing a big beater for your opponent to get over but also a disruption as well. i think the deck is decent at best. of course the deck is not meta by any means but i do know that this is defiantly a step in the right direction for red-eyes since the deck itself hasn't been getting the respect it deserves. yes the card line up does seem a little awkward, but that doesn't mean it cant be make good by any stretch of the imagination. if you guys have any ideas on what to put in to make this beck better, feel free to comment down below."

You want to see as much combo pieces as possible so I really don't want to run less then 3</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Copernicus"">D/D Savant Copernicus</a> - I have seen people run less then 3. THOSE HAVE 0 IDEA what the fk they are doing with D/Ds period. This card is literally an Arma knight of the deck with 5 amazing targets. How MENTAL do you have to be to run less.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Thomas"">D/D Savant Thomas</a> - This card is not an amazing combo piece but it is a combo piece, Usually it is a combo piece for late parts of a combo. I have seen people run more, maybe they don't want to banish it off desires but it ll just brick your hands. RUN 1, Laplace is also Thomas 2.0 I would rather run one of each but I am not even doing that. He is far from a bad card but overated by many. But Maybe I am biased as a Croatian and Tesla fan (No I am not)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Swirl Slime"">D/D Swirl Slime</a> - Everyone runs 3. The best combo piece. This card was semi-limited at one point that says enough</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Necro Slime"">D/D Necro Slime</a> - I could understand people running less then 3 but cards such as Almiraj and Performapal Pop-up really push it to 3.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Lamia"">D/D Lamia</a> - Everyone runs 3. Funny enough I often dump all 3 turn 1 (ofc you can only use 1 it just happens with D/D ghost ;P). Used to be semi limited.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""D/D Ghost"">D/D Ghost</a> - So this card in a nutshell buffs the viability of Necro Slime and Vice Typhoon, because it really fills the graveyard which if you tried playing D/D lately you ll notice is SUPER IMPORTANT. It can also be revived with Clotheep and then you can cross into Fiber since Ghost is a tuner and get Lamia. It works well with most of your combo pieces. I even debated running 2, or running high king Alexander, but it made no sense to go over 40. I went from hating the card to not touching the D/D without it... Ghost wasn't included in some of the replays, I figured running him is optimal via playtesting (An old D/D player)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Kepler"">D/D Savant Kepler</a> - Oh yeah... Dark Contract Searcher, so Searches everything. Idk what else to say run 3. Even better in the ocg WITH 2 one for one.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> - Superb card. Here are some card combinations you typically don't want. Kepler + Gate, Necro Slime + Vice Typhoon, Lamia + Copernicus, duplicates.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> (Unless you are in ocg then run 2) - there are like... 3 good targets duh.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""P&lt;a data-name=&quot;ot of desires&quot;&gt;ot of desires&lt;/a&gt;"">P</a><a data-name=""ot of desires"">ot of desires</a> - If you banish thomas / Ghost its fine in most of the cases</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Foolish burial"">Foolish burial</a> - DUHHHHHHHH</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Performapal Pop-Up"">Performapal Pop-Up</a> - there are 13 cards you wan't in the graveyard + the deck can always revive everything from the graveyard.. so you can even dump thomas revive him later put up Titanic. Just be careful with life payment. Remind yourself to turn off your own Contracts with Siegfried etc if needed. It ups the consistency of the deck</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Gate"">Dark Contract with the Gate</a> - A continous Rota</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Swamp King"">Dark Contract with the Swamp King</a> - this card fusions from both hand field and graveyard. If it fuses from hand / field keep in mind it doesn't banish, it sends your cards to the graveyard so it can sort of act like a Swirl Slimes first effect. I would not fault one for playing 2. Its a great card.</li>  	<li>2x Impermanence - so this handtrap can be set.. which is important because you don't want to lose to much lifepoints of performapal Pop-Up</li>  	<li>1x Ghost ogre - There is a needlefiber in the deck... this can put Ogre on the field, ogre works from the field. You can also revive ogre with clotheep, since ghost ogre is a tuner you can also link into fiber get lamia</li>  	<li>1x Ghost ash - best handtrap in a game by a mile, a tuner.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Extra deck: </strong> <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""D/D/D Flame King Genghis"">D/D/D Flame King Genghis</a> (Previously known as Temujin) - You literally need 2 for some combos.... Revive</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Flame High King Genghis"">D/D/D Flame High King Genghis</a> - I feel like sometimes even the second one is required but there is just nooooo space. Reviver, handles backrow decks well going second</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc"">D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc</a>- He is just a level 7 fusion you drop which then you use with lamia to enter the Savage / Siegfried. Sometimes he gets revived off your D/D/D revives so that again you can enter something with Lamia. Win condition against burn decks, can save you from Contracts</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Gust King Alexander"">D/D/D Gust King Alexander</a> - D/D reviver, only revives &lt;=4 monsters just like Clotheep</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a> - Makes your Ragnarok nutz because at that point Ragnaroks revives twice per turn. Normally such play gives you Titanic</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried</a>- Yes, negates are good, A D/D name so can be revived, can even help you heal a bit of LP</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystal wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal wing Synchro Dragon</a> - OUR CRYSTAL DRAGON IS BACK IN D/D &lt;33333</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> - New Addition for D/D decks. Sometimes your ending board is literally 3 level 8 synchros, trust me this isn't to much lvl 8 synchros</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a> - A new card, with Fiber this forces your Opp to discard 1 card. I chose it over Formula, Wonder Magician (don't wanna pop my own contracts), and Shooting Riser Dragon but you can also run any of the 3 without much winrate difference imo.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> - Fk thats a long name, succ the spells, protect the Appolousa..</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>- so this helps you put those Lamias, Necro slimes etc in graveyard. It really buffs such cards</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> - Might get banned... This is the only threat for the future of the deck,  this card is also not to essential, other Link4s aren't much worse</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystron Needlefiber"">Crystron Needlefiber</a> - will we ever get him???

Why not draw for burn damage? Greed let's you make the latter happen!,"Using the Continuous Trap 'Greed', this deck intends to make your opponent draw a lot of cards, to then let 'Greed' deal damage to your opponent for every card drawn.  This deck is not meant to be used competitively. It's a non-competitive deck meant to just be occasionally played for some fun in a way you may not expect. I personally fought against this deck when first using my Frog the Jam Turbo deck (also uploaded on this site).  To make this deck, or at least a deck surrounding 'Greed' more competitive, I've been recommended to use Dark World and/or Danger cards. Whether I want to make a more competitive version of this deck, I'm not sure."

Now I want to post my going first list because going first muskets is also a really good deck. The goal is to go first, summon a musket and hopefully be able to have in your opening hand, and use <a data-name=""Ties of The Brethren"">Ties of The Brethren</a> to summon 2 other muskets and pass turn and use musket cards in hand to interrupt your opponent and control the game. There's not very much for me to talk about for this deck because there are not many combos or many details I can talk about. All I can really say is <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> is broken. The only broken combo in this deck I came up with is that you can use <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Mastermind Zakiel"">Magical Musketeer Mastermind Zakiel</a> and 2 other monsters to go into the new BLS link 3 and be able to get its effect to become untargetable and indestructible by card effects which is very hard for most decks to get over and most of the time, ends up winning you the game. This deck just got much more powerful since everything else was effected by the banlist but this deck wasn't. I personally believe this version of muskets or the going second build I posted last week is a good meta call for this format. I hope you guys enjoy and stick around for more decks soon, especially post banlist."

Thanks to Gizmek Yata you can use your Normal Summon for core, use extenders like Machine Dupe, Galaxy Soldier or Cyber Dragon Nachster to swarm the field and after this make a second normal summon.  Because Cyber Dragons don't need any field spell you can use Magical Meltdown, which allows you to add Aleister direct from the Deck.  Tribute Core for Yata and then use your second Normal Summon for Aleister, who adds Invocation from your deck to your hand . Next you go into Link-Aleister.

The basic idea is to get the Necrofears on board and either sit on them to win with Destiny Board or use them as rank 8 material. Beat Cop is decent because she immediately puts herself in the grave to be banished for Dark Necrofear and can protect stuff. The main problem I have with this deck is searching because it is super slow and takes about three turns to do anything, and also some Extra Deck suggestions would help."

And given the support they've gotten this year, nothing made me happier than seeing these bad boys back in style and even crazier than ever. Now, instead of simply one HERO subarchetype reigning a whole deck, all HEROs pop up to make a difference, from all subs and walks of life for one common goal.  The idea of the deck is to go for as quick a satisfying KO as possible by quickly summoning low-level Warrior monsters in the form of HEROs, each with their own outstanding effects and potential, to make way for far more powerful Fusion and Link HEROs. It's not necessarily the ""mandatory"" way to run HEROs, play whatever you want the way you want. It's simply how I personally enjoy running the deck, and you're more than welcome to substitute things for say, Malicious Bane or Infinite Impermanence if your wallet can take it.  One thing you'll want to do right away is special summon <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> by discarding a HERO from your hand, preferrably <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a>, or any of your Miracle Fusion targets. This, in turn, lets you add <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> to your backrow, which you can then activate to tribute Faris and special summon itself to the field, which then lets you bring <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> about. Vyon is vital as he allows you to send other grave-centric HEROs there, as well as banish Faris or any other HERO from there to search for Polymerization.  <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a> is vital as both a way to bring out monsters like Stratos and Shadow Mist to the field and a way to recycle HEROs from the grave if it's sent there by a card like Polymerization. Prime targets include the aforementioned <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> and Shadow Mist, either for HERO searches, backrow popping, or adding <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> to your hand. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a> is also worthwhile given all the extra HEROs on the field you have, being able to take those out to bring itself to the field and let its Skill Drain/Relinquished-esque effects run wild.  Onto the Extra deck, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> requires no introduction, as his ability to lock out important grave-centric cards of your opponent and punish them for searching makes him a must for this deck. That's not to say <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a> doesn't have his place, though, boasting high ATK and being able to both attack directly and search for additional Mask Changes. Meanwhile, cards like <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO"">Destiny HERO</a> - Dangerous are the reasons to run <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>, Dystopia allowing you to do chip damage while Celestial or Decider are in the grave while gaining ATK from either Dread Decimator, Honest Neos, or Dangerous to pop any card your opponent controls, and Dangerous for fodder to send card like Mali and Shadow Mist to the grave.  <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> acts as a free search if a Destiny HERO's in your grave, meanwhile <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver</a> allows you to recycle your Poly's and Mask Changes and <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> powers up any HERO it points to.  By far the absolute boss monster of the deck is none other than <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunriser"">Elemental HERO Sunriser</a>. Requiring generic material to summon, he makes an easy boost to any board of yours, powering up your monsters depending on all the attributes you control and popping a card your opponent controls once a turn when your HERO attacks. Not only that, but he also lets you search <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a>, helping you set up for Omni-HEROs like <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a> to act as a ticking time bomb or <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Great Tornado"">Elemental HERO Great Tornado</a> for weakening powerful tools.  All in all, HEROs make for an optimal OTK tool if played in the right hands, and I sincerely hope you have as much fun with them as I do."

Enjoy ^_^,"Well, from some time, I've become a little obsessed about Vendreads. I know that the ""Zombie World"" would be a better choice, but I wana keep the retro style of the deck (since people are already tired of Doomking  :D  ), so I opted for a 2nd best choice, of mixing the deck with Shiranui. A 100% pure Vendread deck would be to weak, since we all know that the archtype by itself lacks consistency.  Ok, so the main purpose is to have your ritual bad boys armed with aditional effects, but remember, your ritual materials MUST BE ON THE FIELD, for they to receive the best additonal effects. That's why Impcantation (the best support for almost all ritual decks) has no sinergy with this deck, cause you need to you use specific materials. That makes the deck a bit tricky. The most common scene is to have a Revendread Slayer ritual summon by using Revenants and Houndhorde as FIELD materials. In this case you'll have a full armed Slayer with 2 Quick effects that will give opponents headache! ^_^. The best scene is to have an Executor ritual summon using Revenants, Houndhorde and Core as FIELD materials. In this scenario, none of your cards can be targeted by opp effects ;).  And ya, as the main counter we have the frightening rock bastard Nibiru, to punish our opp in case he wants to put to many negations or if he wants to Borrelsword us! If we don't use Nibi in this way, it can be also useful, as he's Lv 11, and can be used as entire tribute from hand for all the ritual monsters.  Enough with the words!

You aren't impressed by my furry with a fan!?!? But what if I have TwWwoOo furries with a fan?!??!?!??!?!,"Come along! Come along! For I shall present to you the newest weapon of the furry nation! Furries with a fan!!!  Got a Problem with those pesky towers??? No problem, Just summon a windy furry and thew will just blow them away! Revolutionary, I say!!!!  And they cost only 19.99$ Call now or you will miss this fantastic opportunity of annoying the ever-loving shit out of the person your playing against!  Plus if you call now! We will throw in an extra deck full of staples which gives twice the cancer experience! Call under 555-WhyTheFuckAmIDoingThis-725  ( Warning: The windy furries target and are thus bad in every way shape or form from a modern Yugioh perspective! The furry nation isn't liable for not getting rid of  pesky towers! Use with caution! )  ...........  Yea I don't know what that was either.  Its that time of the year again, where I shall upload a new deck to the Yugi community and revolutionize it with BRILLIANT deck choices! The meta shall BOW before me.....Getting off-topic again sorry  SO like always, I'll start this profile with a small story!:  Its the year ...äh 2017 I guess, and little Felix found out about the yosenju archetype! Being in love with Beast warriors before thanks to Lunalight, little Felix decided to give it a look! And little Felix....did not like what he saw.  &nbsp;  Basically Yousenju existed a few years ago out of 3 cards, the 3 Yosenju Karmas. The other few cards were of course, trivial! The rest of the deck at that time consisted of control deck staples, like solemn strike, warning judgment etc you get the drill. So that meant it wasn't really fun to play AND it literally costs a leg and a liver. So as a young naive duellist....I just gave it the ""Its shitty"" stamp.  But ooooh golly, the Yugioh Gods were not pleased with that opinion, so they decided to give the deck so much new support in rising rampage, that it's basically now a whole new archetype!  For example, they got 2 really great new pendulum monsters, the mayosenjus, that can just when they are pendulum summoned, bounce up to 2 cards on the field back to the hand (So btw, they can bounce tenki/ Kaijus and just use them again )  Or another example, they got some decent effect negate and ""battle protection"" in the form of secret move and sword sting. So they aren't so flimsy anymore.  I honestly don't know what to say about this deck, except that it is just an absolute blast to play! It's very spammy which I like a lot and it can compete with a lot of decks, as bouncing to the hand is still really strong even though they target. Don't be like me back then, give Yoseju a chance and annoy your friends and family with it!  &nbsp;  Thank you for supporting my, by clicking on this profile! It really encourages me to upload more decks. If you like the deck, it would be very very sweet of you to leave a like down bellow and I hope you'll read my Next Profile!

Several other HEROs make an appearance, such as <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> and <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a>. You'll want to try and discard Shadow Mist using the effects of either <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a>, <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a>, Super Polymerization, or send it to the grave by the effect of Vyon or Neos Fusion.

The win con is an otk with nightingale and an equip that powers her up enough to 0 ur opponents lp thru her ability to attack directly a number of times equal to the materials attatched to her. The pendulum engine provides various negates and recursions as well as a pendulum summon which allows cobalt sparrow to add a lvl 1 winged beast to ur hand. Pendulumucho is a great target for cobalt is summoned before ur pendulum summon bcuz its 0 scale allows u to set up for big dump from your hand. the deck is still a work in progress and if you have any questions or advice plz comment!!!

They can put up to 3 Negates. That is a welcome addition to a deck which already strives going secon,"https://youtu.be/FMVsDHepZWM - Deck in action on youtube (Subscribe perhaps=?)  Card Ratio explanations: <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> - HOPT On summon searches any other fluffal or edge imp sabres. You want to see him as much as possible</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> - Everyone knows about Bear Wings combo. You just have to max out on him</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> - Great card but there is no reason to play more, Muligans your hand (sort of), its board swarm isn't hopt so you can abuse it with Clotheep summoning both Owl &amp;Dog in the same turn. Very good card. Used to be more valuable with Toad and Norder, nowdays just a one off</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a> - Poly searcher on summon or polymerization itself on the field, can search fusion substitute as can any card which searches poly. Ofc you gotta play 1. By playing 1 any card which searches ""Fluffals"" also gives a poly access, super relevant if vendor sacks Dog</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> - A must run, allows you to enter Clotheep / Anaconda super easy. Increases the ammount of fusion resources you have by reviving an edge imp and bouncing a fluffal (Dog  / Owl usually), since you can still fuse with monsters in your hand this card indirectly pluses whenever you do that</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a> - If you fuse with this card you can add back poly. You can Chain mask your key effects such as Frightfur Tiger pop. Not normal summon reliant yet it makes sure you keep fusion summoning which is important for Predaplant Dragostapelia, Sabre Tooth and whatnot</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Fluffal Wing"">Fluffal Wing</a> - Playing 3 is bricky, it works well with performapal - pop up and Dragun of Red-eyes even. If we ever get brill fusion back at 3 I ll play just 1.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Edge imp chain"">Edge imp chain</a> - self searcher on attack so another monster which can increase the number of fusion resources. But he is played for the second effect. whenever he is sent to the graveyard from your hand/field by fusion summon, Performapal pop-up, toy vendor.... he can search a frightfur card.. Hi Patchwork</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Edge imp sabres"">Edge imp sabres </a>- Super searchable as both dog, vendor, and frihgtfur patchwork search it. You kinda don't need more then one for your deck to function not that playing 2 would impact your winrate to much. Combos well with Toy Vendor</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>- So this cards search effect ain't once per turn, somewhat coinflipy but if you do get lucky it puts you so far ahead</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Performapal Pop-Up"">Performapal Pop-Up</a> - a control able card destruction which doesn't make your opponent draw handtraps. Can be vulnerable to ash but there are quite a few cards you wan't to discard in this deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fusion Substitute"">Fusion Substitute</a> - As searchable as polymerization is. The draw 1 effect really helps</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> - So I am running 2 polymerizations and 1 fusion sub. I recently tried 1-1 ratio, or just 2 polymerization ratio. This is what I prefer just slightly over the other 2 ratios and any other ratio would be trash</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Factory"">Frightfur Factory</a> - Continous polymerization altho I kinda don't like this card as I can only fusion Frightfur monsters with it... This card is sort of a must because Edge imp Chain can search it... in case you already cycled patchwork, Frightfur fusion rivals that even less nowdays because it can also be used with Anaconda. One can try running 2x Frightfur fusion instead, but there won't be much winrate diff imo</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur fusion"">Frightfur fusion</a> - fusion which uses grave and field, searchable and it also works with Anaconda.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Foolish burial goods"">Foolish burial goods</a> - this is a card you want to draw the most, even more then patchwork. Sends Vendor but you can also send Fusion sub</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> - better then Pot of Greed in this deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Red-eyes fusion"">Red-eyes fusion</a> (Edge imp sabres puts it back in the deck if you draw it)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark magician"">Dark magician</a>  (see above). You need to play him to enter Dragun of Red-eyes off Anaconda which is quite scarry boss monster</li>  	<li>1x Phantazmay - Material for Red-eyes fusion I personaly am not a fan of Phantazmay but its the best target</li>  	<li>2x Ash</li>  	<li>2x Nibiru</li>  	<li>2x Storm</li> </ul> Extra deck <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Frightur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightur Sabre-Tooth</a> - Multiple Sabretooths come up all the time, Don't need 3 due to fusion sub</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> - 2nd Tiger comes up sometimes, its a multi pop card. Sometimes you need multiples</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a> - OTK</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> - Kraken + Sabre-Tooth combo can out double colossus</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a> - Armades effect, honestly not to relevant but sort of a staple. Don't feel like running Instant fusion for it</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Dare Devil"">Frightfur Dare Devil</a> - Both Dark and 8. So can cross into both Felgrand and Dragostapelia.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dragun of Red-eyes"">Dragun of Red-eyes</a> - 2 BRICKS are def worth it</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand"">Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand</a> - Better then other r8s because he can detach for fusion sub. Negate</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> - No we don't summon this with super Poly.

joyous spring with 2-3 called by the grave</em>: i use 3 and 2 of this combo, it's on what you prefer, if you'd rather protect your searches go for grave but if you prefer to stop ememy plays then go ash, but not that impermanece counters grave and ash can only be used once per turn,  depending on situation and first game, i might remove them and switch for side deck on second game  *some sort of draw engine, 2 draw engine is optimal. i use 3 pot of duality since most of my special summons happen on oponent turns.specially in the early stages. then i also use the spell book engine, 1 of each because i can't manage to remove other cards to run 1 boy and 2 and 2 books, so i just use one of ea. if you have extravagance, it's also a good option but you would need to modifie the extra deck to have more pairs and at that point may wan to remove a super poly or 2  since you won't be able to relly on it as much. i don't recomend pot of desires since to risky  *3 solemn judgment since it counters anything, really strong and destroys all pendulum summon, only counter is supper poly, and onlike strike, if your hp is low, you can still use it.  *1 skill drain: if you have this card it's pretty much gg if you have your DM engine on bord.  also if you use magician rod and illusion magic, you can still use rods effect.  *3 super poly: saves me so many time, but also a good side deck switch option for when you face things like skystriker since its useless, i'd keep 1 just to posible be able to special summon the dark magician dragon with imduk.</div></blockquote> optional card: <blockquote><div>dark magic veil: just a solid good card that allows you to summon from graves or hand, works well if illusion apprentice and dark magician if you have circle on feild.  magician of dark illusion works well but wouldn't use more than 1</div></blockquote> EXTRA DECK <strong>good supper poly targets</strong>: <blockquote><div>*mudragon: for when they don't have dark monsters  *starving venom: goto dark super poly target  *guardragon almarduke: doesn't happen often but if they ever have 3 link on field, it can break their board. specialy if no dark monsters  *predaplant dragostapelia: used if they have a fusion monster and you or him have a dark monster,  *dark magician dragon knight: in rare case if they have a dragon, but more often you will use your dark magician with either imduk or whomeever reprodocus is pointing 2.</div></blockquote> <strong>the 3 xyz monsters are good solid cards to have</strong>  <strong>good link monsters:</strong> <blockquote><div><strong>* </strong>beatcop to protect you ethernal soul, link spider for when you only have 1 darkmagician to circle around with, imduk does the same and is a poly target for you dragon knight but he points to enemy side, so risky sometimes, reproducus for when i only have 1 DM but  multple monster on field so i can turn 1 to dragon and poly with  the DM for dragon knight,(doesn't happen often, mainly use imduk.  *black luster soldier  is really good but to expesive for me but if you have it, use it, its really good with you DM since its 7 star.  *berserker of tenyi: not that great, but is easy to summon with the trap card fists of the unrivaled tenyi trap card. but if you rather have extra imduk just incase, that works 2</div></blockquote> &nbsp;  <strong>My side deck</strong>  this depends on the people deck at you casuals, but i find what i have to be pretty good to counter most decks, i'd say soul drain and summon limit and storming mirrors are very solid picks, and the rest change as you please  &nbsp;  the deck is around 150-200$ (not counting black luster soldier) depending on the rarities you go for.  the expensive cards are (but not really if you compare other type of deck):  apprentice illusion:10-20$ (need 2-3)  magician navigation:10-15$ (need 2-3)  predaplant triphyovertum:5-10$  ebon illusion:10-20$  (luster if you want it: 70-90$)  rest is arroun 1-5$ cards  i won't add side deck since thats more situational  but other good choice would be nibiru and dinowrestler pankrtops  <strong>final notes:</strong>  i tries eye of timaeus but i find it to bricky since you need a DM and you can't search it, you wouldnt want more than 1 or maybe 2 if desperate but it's a dead card, while super poly can be used for multiple different uses.  another fun way is to add 2 dragon keeper and trade 1 super poly for 1 ultra poly so you can search. but as fun as it is , its easy to counter, but its fun."

And after testing this concept on ygopro, the deck I came up with is crazy strong going second and breaks boards really easily. This deck is meant to go second, the way this deck works is that you first use the Muskets to attempt to break their board and you can even use <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> under the same column as a Musket monster to trigger it's effect and get a strong fusion off. If your first attempt with Muskets fail then you that is why you play 2 Crooked Crown and the Shaddoll engine. Because in this current meta everyone is always ending on an extra deck monster, using Shaddoll Fusion going second is so strong. Since Construct is level 8 as well, you can use <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> to take control of your opponent's monster and use another monster you control to go into the new BLS link 3 that is insane and the likely hood of your opponent getting over it is very low unless they are playing Orcust. Also for those of you that are already fans of Magical Musketeers and are wondering why I choose to play 2 Dancing Needle and 2 Crooked Crown its because almost every deck in this format abuses their graveyard and Dancing Needle really hurts, especially against Salad and Orcust. I think for a different format in the future where the graveyard is not as abused Dancing Needle can go to 1 in the deck. The reason for 2 Crooked Crown is because the deck suffers if it loses its normal summon, so you need to be able special summon another Musket monster in order to recover, and the card is a free plus if you activate it under the same column as another Musket monster. I bet you guys are also wondering about <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> as well. You probably think I'm a madman but in reality this card is broken in this deck. The combo is with <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Doc"">Magical Musketeer Doc</a> where you activate Goods under the same column as him and send any Magical Musket Spell or Trap that you want to get back to your hand, and then Doc activates allowing you to add that card from your dump off Goods. This is something I came up with while testing and think its really strong, especially while playing Doc at 3. Also in testing the third Max never comes up for me because the game ends too soon. Even if the third Max comes up in some sort of a long grind game this is why I chose to play 3 Doc and 1 Wild. This deck is also pretty consistent for the most part. I hope you guys enjoy this deck profile and stick around for more cool meta decks that I post :D."

This is a brand new strategy I have discovered, inspired by many other Sky Striker players ","This is the brand new Sky Strikers!!! I tried my best to try and make the deck somewhat close to tier 1 or 2... This deck's win conditions are to use super poly and the pure Sky Striker engine. So, you first summon a Sky Striker ace link monster to your field for their awsome effects, then super poly your opponent's field and fuse into your starving venom or triphyoverutum and go under the link arrow. From there, you can start destroying your opponent's board or link into Pheonix or Unicorn and control... It's all up to you!!! Feel free to comment below your suggestions on this deck."

The basics like gadgets and Galaxy Soldier are still here to start the same loops that the classic builds.  &nbsp;  So the specific cards you'll find are :  The Psy-Frame package, that is usefull to negate an Ash Blossom targetting a draw card or Terraforming/Union Hangar to have 2 monsters to start boards pretty effectively, or just use Psy-Frame Lambda's ability to negate cards during your opponent's turn to add disruption to your established board. Note that they are light attribute and are potential targets for Galaxy Soldier's effect.  The Sky Striker package is really good in this deck sinse it can search out multiple Sky Striker cards and cycle the deck when having good effects to handle the opponent's board. Kagari is a machine monster and can be used to summon Platinum Gadget. With Sky Striker Mecha - Shark Canon and Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor you can handle annoying monsters in the graveyard or in the field like Plasma Destiny Hero, and steal opponent's monsters to rapidly gain access to Avramax and Borrelsword for OTK strategies.  Monster Gate can deblock hands by sending somme letters to the graveyard that would trigger summoning or searching effects and can bring out monsters like Silver Gadget or Gold Gadget to spam the board and gain access to ABC Dragon Buster even with a bricky hand. Note that you can send spells to the graveyard and instantly gain acces to the full power effects of the Sky Striker cards.  Twin Twisters are Added main deck to send a needed letter to the graveyard and break backrow cards and floodgates that could stop the deck in some situations.  The extra deck is quite generic, we Simply run a Gear Gigant X to search the last letters for the summoning of ABC Dragon Buster, and Crusadia Equimax to have a simple way to summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with the Sky Striker combos or bypass the biggest beatsticks and potentially gain access to simple OTKs.  &nbsp;  The side deck :  Dark Ruler No More is a great card against combo decks like Guardragons and won't be negated by Mystical Beasts monsters from Pendulum decks, it's also a spell card so it will allow us to triger the full power effect of Sky Striker cards more easilly.  Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners is an alternative way to handle monsters and is a safe way to break through monsters that prevent special summons like Vanity Fiend or monsters with annoying disruption effects to start our loops, it is searchable by Engage.  <span>Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay is a good way to draw cards when going second against decks like Orcust, and can pressure opponent's play that set monsters with disruption effects</span>  The artifact package is an excellent option to lock combo decks when going first with Artifact Scythe and can stop Orcust and Thunder Dragon with Artifact Lancea.  Lastly Anti-Spell Fragrance is a way to shut down Sky Striker and Pendulum when going first and won't be a problem after we set our board."

They don't make the most impressive boards but can make some that easily win you the game (They also have a OTK, for those who want). This Dino deck really depends on going second and going first with the wrong cards in your hand can hurt sometimes.  Lost World Dino is one of my favorite decks and I will show you why. Dino's have a very simple strategy; putting big beatsticks and negates on the board. This is mostly possible with ULTIMATE CONDUCTER TYRANNO, the EVOLZAR duo and PANKRATOPS. The main plays start with OVIRAPTOR and a combination of MISCELLANEOUSAURUS and/or LOST WORLD in your hand, this is why you play 3 FOSSIL DIG to search you combo starters. I play 6 handtraps to disrupt opponents plays and 2 to get rid of powerfull boss monsters.  The OTK is having an token on your opponents field with LOST WORLD (OTK is still possible without token, you opponent just needs a monster on their side of the field), getting DUGARES on the board with UCT, activating DUGARES's effect to double UCT's attack, linking DUGARES and another card away for PENTESTAG (that points to UCT), destroy a monster in your hand to change your opponents monsters to face down defense position, attack every monster with UCT for 7000 piercing dmg (and directly after all monsters are gone.  Any questions can be send to me, will do my best to answer them quickly.  Thank you and have fun playing!"

It has a problem establishing strong first turn boards. I also tried a Zombieworld variant but ended up liking this build better. Vampire Sucker can take advantage for Zombie World but I just never ended up using her opponent's monster tributing effect. For me Vampire Kingdom felt to work better. I also like this version better because it focuses more on the actual vampire cards. Vampire Fraulein and Vampire Domination are probably my favorite cards of the Deck.

This deck doesn't have a side deck because I am still kind of new to yu-gi-oh, I am not the best at swapping cards from my decks, I try to put in any cards that counter other cards in right away, I don't know what kind of cards to counter directly, and I always go for the max of 60 cards in the main deck."

Any hand that opens with at least 1 Mekk, 1 Traptrix, and 1 spell/trap is capable of creating a somewhat strong opening board.  Going first your best bet is to establish a column by turning any main deck Traptrix monster into Sera and using any spell/trap to create an opening for your Mekk-knights to be summoned. Once you've done most of your Mekk-knight plays, you can either turn any level 4s on the field into a Traptrix Rafflesia or a Time Theif Redoer or using 3 cards to create BLS - Soldier of Chaos. This deck is capable of opening only monsters or only spell/traps, but it is usually a healthy mix of both.  The best hand I've experienced with this deck was:  Myrmeleo, Purple Nightfall, Kagetokage, Shade Brigandine, and Secret."

That's what I did here, using the Arcana Force archetype for the Main Deck, and mostly filling my Extra Deck with Utopia monsters.  Adding Ties of the Brethren, Shining Angel and Nova Summoner for a bit of consistency, this deck is meant to use these Level 4 LIGHT Fairy monsters to Summon the various Utopia forms and hopefully bring victory. With 'Utopia Double' and 'Double or Nothing!' included in the deck, an OTK is possible if the opponent controls an ATK position monster with max 2000 ATK. Honest can help make an OTK, such as this one, easier. Note that Honest cannot be used in conjunction with Utopia the Lightning's effect, as Lightning's ATK change happens after the final chance to activate Honest."

Going first you can go 1 of 2 ways: 1) If you know your facing a Nibiru, make Apollousa by 5th summon. You can use will, archiver, and your natural extenders to do this. 2) If you know there's no nibiru, just perform the standard salamangreat combo, you should be able to end on 2 negates on field and at least 1 hand trap in the hand for 3 disruptions. Ghost belle is a very strong hand trap this format, being able to hit every one of the top decks. Orcust- stops cymbal skeleton and Yellow Martin for the LunaLight build. Strikers- Stops raye and kagari. Salamangreats- what doesn't it stop? Thunder- Stops hawk preventing the thunder player from extending combo.  &nbsp;  The side deck is more diverse able to handle a wider variety of decks. Red reboot would be your flex spot, if you feel like adding a 3rd twin twisters or another sanctum feel free. You'll notice no nibiru, this is because nibiru isn't really as strong as you'd believe right now. Its a blow-out vs rogue decks but hurts the meta decks very little. If you disagree, you're welcome to experiment with it, I feel its a waste of space better used for more effective hand traps or stun cards like the artifact package. I have included trap trick in the side deck as a 3rd sanctum. The idea behind this is that trap trick is a way to thin 2 cards from your deck upon activation. Even if you open with sanctum and trap trick, you can use the card to grab an impermanence and thin 2 cards from your deck and increase consistency."

Desde Yu-Gi-Oh!GX, quando o Jaden Yuki invocava aquelas lindas fusões clássicas, sempre tive um enorme desejo em fazer esse deck, ao qual, admiro muito.  Bem, pra quem não sabe, o deck gira em torno de monstros do tipo guerreiro, dos mais variados atributos, que envolve principalmente invocação do deck extra de monstros fusão, sendo eles definidos nas seguintes tipos de HERO: <ul>  	<li>Herói Elementar</li>  	<li>Herói do Destino</li>  	<li>Herói Mascarado</li>  	<li>Herói da Visão</li>  	<li>Herói Maléfico</li>  	<li>Neospacial</li>  	<li>Herói Xtra</li> </ul> E bem, e a mecânica do deck é até que muito boa, no qual você busca as suas matérias de fusão e pelos mais variados efeitos, busca meios de usa-las para trazer seus HEROS mais fortes. E por muito tempo, o deck foi bem abalado, tendo a carta ""Um Herói Vive"" limitada, e só recentemente, o Herói do Elemento Stratos saiu completamente da banlist, após quase 5 anos banido/limitada, e claro, o Herói do Destino - Malicioso, que com mais uma cópia, te dá acesso a mais combos e monstros a serem trazidos.  O seu campo Core, é sempre passar o turno, se for você quem começa, com um Herói Destino - Plasma, que nega todos os efeitos de monstros de face pra cima no campo do oponente, uma habilidade extremamente forte, forçando seu oponente a ter que interagir com você e gastar recursos, e mais um monstro para se dar a Mudar a Máscara, que vai ser setada e utilizada no turno do oponente, com o objetivo de trazer a Lei Negra, o Herói Mascarado, que todas as cartas do oponente são banidas em vez de ir pro cemitério, e claro, a sua habilidade de que se o oponente adiciona cartas na mão do deck, ele descartar uma carta, o que faz o seu oponente perder ainda mais recursos. Também pode se por um Herói do Destino - Distopia sendo apontado pelo Herói Xtra Dizimador Horrífico, que aumenta o atk dele e de monstros HERO em suas zonas em 100 pra cada HERO de nome diferente no cemitério, e claro, Distopia destrói qualquer carta no turno de qualquer jogador, contanto que ele esteja com o atk alterado, o que é sempre bom ter em mãos, o Neos Honesto, para dar muito atk as seus HEROS, servindo tanto para bater no seu oponente, como para defender seus HEROS.  E como jogando por segundo, fazendo os mais variados combos para trazer o Herói Elementar Sunriser que te dá acesso à Fusão Miraculosa, podendo assim trazer o Herói Elementar Zero Absoluto usando o Herói Elementar Liquidman e outro Herói Elementar, para se dar uma Mudar a Máscara no Zero Absoluto, com o objetivo de ""triggar"" os efeitos do Zero Absoluto e o Herói Mascarado Acid,  que, quando Zero Absoluto saí do campo ele destrói todos os monstros do oponente, ""trigga"" o efeito do Acid, que quando entra no campo, destrói todas as cartas mágicas e armadilhas do oponente, deixando o campo livre para um OTK, sendo para mim, um dos combos mais fortes dos HEROS.  O deck ainda irá receber os futuros suportes, mas o que já se percebe, que o deck de HERO chegou chegando, e vai causar bastante barulho, muito certamente."

The ""Kaiju"" cards are a good way of wiping out monsters and getting a better board for you. For example: if you have ""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" and ""Jizukiru, the star destroying kaiju"" in your hand while your opponent controls a monster, you can tribute ur opponents monster to summon gameciel to their field and u can now special summon jizukiru, who has 3300 ATK while gameciel has 2200 ATK.U know what to do now."

You also want to see it as it can battle monsters that cant be destroyed by battle, by instead banishing them for the phase.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Knight(x2) <ul>  	<li>This is at 2 because you dont want to see it in your hand as much due to it being a brick. You want to search this card from the effect of Galaxy Soldier (you should discard Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon for the effect of Galaxy Soldier). This card does take up a normal summon from you but in return can summon another level 8 for you to go into your XYZ monsters.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Soldier(x3) <ul>  	<li>One of the best cards in the main deck as it allows you discard a card to special summon itself and search a ""Galaxy"" monster. This card will generally be summoned by discarding Galaxy-Eyes Photon dragon to search Galaxy Knight, assuming that you have not normal summoned prior to Galaxy Soldiers special summon. Having more than 2 Galaxy Soldiers can also result in you summoning Cyber Dragon Infinity.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Wizard(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card is your main normal summon and a great card for searching and setting up. This card can also turn into a level 8 thus helping you with your XYZ summons. Futhermore if able to summon this card, with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in the GY and Photon Vanisher or and other body on the field, then you can tribute Galaxy Wizard and search Galaxy Trance which you can make Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord. On your opponents turn you can search Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon via Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lords second effect. This gives you two distruptions on the field and and other such as Tachyon Transmigration.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Orbital(x3) <ul>  	<li>Now we get into cards which are mainly used for utility. This card just gives a free search which this deck likes. This card can also be used as Galaxy Soldier's discarder or Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon's discarder.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Vanisher(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card allows the deck to basically get a free Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in your hand. This helps alot and can even be used to special summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon or Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon. This card can be used as discard material.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Main Deck(Spells) - <ul>  	<li>Accellight(x1) <ul>  	<li>Acts as the 4th copy of Galaxy wizard and shall only be used for the purpose. (That's how good Galaxy Wizard is in this deck).</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Expedition(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card Extends your plays and I just cant see why you wont run 3 of this. This card and Galaxy Wizard is a free Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Trance(x2) <ul>  	<li>This card is <em><strong>EXTREMELY GOOD </strong></em>but we only run two because it's a card you want to search off Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord as a way to get an XYZ monster after your opponent destroys all your cards (if they do). The card can also be bricky as you may have no way to send Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon to the GY.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Monster reborn(x1) <ul>  	<li>Extender.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Sanctuary(x3) <ul>  	<li>A free Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon, allowing you to summon more XYZ monsters from the Extra Deck</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Return Of The Dragon Lords(x3) <ul>  	<li>A better monster reborn as it protects your Link and XYZ monsters</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Trade-In(x3) <ul>  	<li>Pot of Greed is banned and this card allows you to get your Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from your hand to the GY. If you bricked and you have Trade-In, Photon Vanisher and a card you can normal summon, it will make you refresh your hand with some bodies on the field.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Zero(x1) <ul>  	<li>You can summon XYZ monsters for free and the XYZ summon using them and bypass Galaxy Zero's effect or this card can be used to extend. This card is not searched usually and you want it late game.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Called By The Grave(x3) <ul>  	<li>Your deck does search and can be irritated by hand traps. But you can still play on even if your opponent has a hand trap. This card is just here for extra backup and support. It can also be used to distrupt your opponent on their turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Main Deck(Traps) - <ul>  	<li>Tachyon Transmigration(x3) <ul>  	<li>A negate dedicated for Galaxy-Eyes, why not run 3?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Extra Deck <ul>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card destroys a card and can summon a Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon. So summon Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon (Effect: Steal a monster from your opponent) &gt;&gt; XYZ summon into Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon (Effect: Destroy a monster) &gt;&gt; XYZ summon into Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon (Effect: Destroy a card). But you cant attack.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>Good for XYZ summoning better XYZ monsters and can control the field with its effect.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>Good for destroying monsters... also has 4000 ATK</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>A great card for battle negation and for Tachyon Tansmigration.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card can gain big attack for OTKs.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord(x2) <ul>  	<li>The card you'll summon the most. This card is a negation and a searcher. You must run 2 minimum.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card can make it the focus of attacks and negate spell cards which are used a lot in decks.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand(x1) <ul>  	<li>Great for protection or negation</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Thunder End Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card should be a card of your choice. Maybe a Rank 4 or a Link monster (Borrelsword)</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Number 97: Draglubion(x1) <ul>  	<li>Unless you've been restricted by card effects which have stated that you cannot summon other monsters except light monsters, this card is great as with its effect you can summon Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon and used its effect to have 7200 ATK for OTKs. (This card replaced Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon. RIP Dark Matter, your fellow Galaxy-Eyes XYZ monsters missing you)</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Nova(x1) <ul>  	<li>To summon Cyber Dragon Infinity</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Infinity(x1) <ul>  	<li>A great negation on the field.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon(x2) <ul>  	<li>This is your Link card and you'll be summoning this card the most as well to get more XYZ monsters on the field. Its summoning effect allows you to get back a card which it mainly would be (in order of piority): <ol>  	<li>Galaxy Solider (for Cyber Dragon Infinity)</li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon(For its own effect). (This can also be 1st place just depends on the situation)</li>  	<li>Photon Orbital (if used as material for the Link summon or sent to the GY as a discarder) so you can use its search effect</li>  	<li>Any Photon or Galaxy monster for (its own effect again)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Side Deck <ul>  	<li>Personally, I think you should make it yourself. Not because im lazy. Look above, I did all of that typing for you.

But this time both of them will be supported by the recently released <em>Curse Necrofear</em> and the Dark Spirits from <em>Legendary Duelists: Immortal Destiny</em>. Foremost by the Dark Spirits - their effects allow us to special summon those heavy hitters Emperor and Empress from the grave during the damage step if your enemy attacks or if your enemy activates an effect, after you discarded them for twin twister for board clear or searching costs for the also new released <em>Dark Spirit's Mastery </em>spell<em>. </em>And don't worry about them effectless - you extend your board with the help from <em>Archfiend Palabyrinth</em>.  The Extra Deck choices are kind of optional, because <em>Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror </em>only allows other fiend-type Monsters in his entourage, but Monsters like <em>Number 49: Fortune Tune </em>and<em> Wind-Up Zenmaines </em>can help you stall for a while, if you bricked a little. And with their effects they can also get off <em>Archfiend Heiress </em>search effect. Except <em>Coral Dragon</em>, which is a good card, let's you draw and you can go for higher Synchro Monsters if you want, the others are Archfiend Cards, which can later be used for the effect of <em>Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror </em>and <em>Archfiend's Roar </em>(which is also a Archfiend Card for Emperor).  At the moment I have no clue what to put into the Side Deck, because in the current Meta Archfiends have not the slightest chance to compete."

Experiment-XYZ (Going Second),"Alright so the story behind this deck concept is that I had a fan named Experiment-XYZ reach out to me on discord telling me he really enjoyed playing my Musket Shaddoll list which made me feel great that I have people who appreciate my hard work for the community. He asked me, why not do a Magical Musket Invoked variant too? And I was like, yeah thats something I didn't think of that could be a really cool concept. Big shoutout to Experiment for coming up with this concept idea and allowing me to make it a reality! I love it when fans reach out to me, even just to tell me that they really like my decks. Because Aleister is an additional normal summon I only wanted to play 1 since we don't want to open many normal summons. The main target for <a data-name=""Inovcation"">Invocation</a> is the Aleister link two, <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker of Madness"">Aleister The Invoker of Madness</a>. The reason for the second Invocation in the side deck is in case your opponent is playing the Invoked engine, this way having two Invocation means you can use their graveyard and their Aleister(s) to fusion summon with as fusion materials. My ratios for the Musket cards have already been explained in my previous Musket builds I have posted. The Cyber Dragon package is insane. While testing I knew that a lot of people are in fear of <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> in this format because it can wipe your opponent's entire board via contact fuse if they are playing Orcust or any machine deck, or, also just wiping their extra monster zone can be enough to tear right through your opponent's board. I really like <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> because it gets rid of your opponent's support cards permanently so you don't have to deal with them later on in the game, like <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>. My last comment I want to make is that I know the side deck is a little weird but it works. This deck is specifically for going second to break boards and Stun / OTK your opponent. But the side deck prepares you to go first as well in case they force you to go first and you know they will like if you win the die roll and you force them to go first, then game 2 they're going to make you go first since you purposely picked to go second the first time. The reason for 2 Nibiru and 1 Artifact Lancea is because I wanted to have multiple options for interruption cards since Nibiru is a hard once per turn, if you draw Nibiru and Lancea you can use both instead of being stuck with 2 Nibiru. It's more of a logical strategy that I came up with. Again, shoutout to Experiment-XYZ for helping out with this deck profile and I hope to see you guys stick around for more awesome decks!"

The objective of this deck is take control of your opponent's monsters, so the first thing that you need to do is use ""Unpossessed"" and ""Awakening of the Possessed"" to protect your lvl 3 monsters. The card ""Masters of the Spiritual Arts"" can help you to use both. In case than the opponent's monster would be too strong and there is not a way to control it, you can use the ""Archnemeses Protos"" or use the ""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"" to beat it.

Machine duplication can also be used on couple of the Infinitracks helping to gain the much needed card advantage. And with cyber dragons being being so popular today Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon is great in the deck. Infinitracks are also mostly level 5 which helps bringing out Infinity. Infinitracks on their own severely lack card advantage and cyber dragons can provide it better than Trains. This deck is in no means a meta deck and isn't meant to be the greatest cyber dragon build. The focus was intended to be more on Infinitracks.  &nbsp;  Link for replays on my channel: <a class=""style-scope ytcp-video-metadata-info"" href=""https://youtu.be/dxE1iVBy3AY"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/dxE1iVBy3AY </a>"

Many strong options but need to pick the right play for each situation. The only li,"The deck is still being improved over time. The biggest problem comes when you have only one play at start and it gets negated, like your Kepler normal summon. You can't always make exactly what you want on turn 1, the outcomes range between Dark Armageddon, White Armageddon, Wave King etc, those are all good ways to start.  Your big enemy is smth like Vanity's fiend or Necrovalley, but you have at least one answer to each in the main deck.  Always remember the potential of Reiji. You can normal summon your Ragnarok with Reiji in pendulum zone, or you can kill your opponent from below 4k hp with him on board.  Try to keep one Ragnarok in extra deck, so that you can bring him and a lv 8 D/D/D from grave every time you want either to make a rank 8, or to banish with Ragnarok.  Some reasonings behind the choices:  Why almost pure D/D/D? There are 3 reasons:  One is that Gilgamesh is a very good value card that you should play in order to move ahead, but it restricts summoning to D/D/D. So anything else can be played on turn 2 only  Second is that unlike something like Orcust, D/D/D really relies on you having other pieces available to you all the time. So you can't start a play by just foolishing a Knightmare, you would probably need at least 3 pieces in hand to do something threatening.  Third is that graveyard summoning effects of Ragnarok and High Genghis are very good, but they only apply to D/D/D. And you would eventually want to return extra deck monsters instead of just another copy of Ragnarok.  &nbsp;  Then why not fully D/D/D?  So the archetype has some very nice cards to help itself out, but all hinges on you pulling off the first few effects, like activating Dark Contract With the Gate, or Kepler, or Swirl Slime, and for that you should use a called by the grave or something of that sort for protection. I'd rather run more interesting cards, but I figured after testing that Called, Impermanence, or one of the alternatives from side deck are pretty needed. Originally I ran Pendulum Switch, which is particularly good for finishing off with a scaled Reiji, or returning a scaled Bright Armageddon etc. It was just too slow.  WHY NOT CLEAR WING etc?  It's common that people try to bring out Clear Wing + Siegfried on turn one. Those two are great together, but you commit your whole hand to those two cards and are left with nothing else because you cannot play Gilgamesh if you want Clear Wing.  I opt for a less impactful first turn board, but having scales set for follow-up turns and Gilgamesh on board to allow a backup if he is destroyed. My favourite card to bring out on turn 1 is High King Ceasar + whatever else you can pull off.  Just remember that the point of this deck is to set up your board and grave and keep options open. Some cards encourage OTK plays but those are very situational. Your Contract with the Gate becomes extremely strong after turn 1 and to fully exploit the optionality of the deck you need to keep scales (or at least one scale) and a well set up extra deck and grave.  Of course, any suggestions are welcome. I have loads of fun with this deck, and hope you do too."

Duh the best plant in a game because its almost any plant in a game. You re-abuse it with super accessible World Legacy succession in certain combos. Check the vid to see a long 1 card lonefire  / Scorpio combo.</li>  	<li>3x Scorpio. What lonefire summons early on atleast. You all know the drill</li>  	<li>1x Darling cobra. Just 1 the deck is a bit streched rather then being at 40 cards tho, you shouldn't draw it often</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Glow-up bulb"">Glow-up bulb</a>. Forget the whole once per duel you lowkey wanna see it so its at 2. Revives itself, sometimes you can sack something worthy</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Spore"">Spore</a>. Essential for Borreload Savage plays. Rose Dragon engine can typically set that up. I used to run 2 but its not Independent as bulb. Revives itself</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""World Carrotweight champion"">World Carrotweight champion</a> - This is what you send of White Rose Dragon. So it gets accessed in most combos. Works well with dangers</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Naturia Rosewhip"">Naturia Rosewhip</a>. Aroma link and needlefiber can both summon this card. Also since Lonefire is re usable lots of times, basically once you get good at this deck your combos ll start extending and you ll be ending on Rosewhip on top of strong boards already. <strong>Your opp can activate 1 spell / trap per turn</strong></li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a> - If this card is added from the deck to the hand you can ss it. Soo a Red Rose dragon which you always access via Fiber ll end up floating into this card, you either search this or a target for Carrotweight champion, depending on combo but both are needed for some combos. works with dangers.</li> </ul> Rose Dragons &amp; Aroma stuff <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""White Rose Dragon"">White Rose Dragon</a>. This card + any level 1 tuner is a full combo, its a free summon if you control a plant tuner / dragon tuner which this deck spamms so yeah</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a>, hello Needlefiber. This card molds your extradeck to be full of Plants &amp; Dragon Synchros</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cross Rose Dragon"">Cross Rose Dragon</a> - The fact that its a dragon matters for Hieratic link, floating effect is really cute specially with Aroma garden since it can sacrifice tokens. You can summon Aromaseraphy monsters which can all produce some disruption along with the trap. Quick effect, Typically good fall back plan tbh.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> (Link) - You actually use this card all the time. Any 1 card combo sooner or later reaches this card. Fantastic card, if your LP are higher battle immunity to itself and Plants it points to (Rose whip, other Aroma synchros). Ofc it has Lonefire effect</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Rosemary"">Aromaseraphy Rosemary</a> - If you gain LP negates an eff. If your LP are higher + 500 to all plants you got</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> - If you gain LP pops a card. Searches on synchro summon (Triggers of Cross Rose), if your LP are higher  Opp can't target, searches certain aroma trap which gives you lifepoints by returning plants to deck / sending em to grave. Also can revive aroma by paying 1000</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> - Card above searches it, its it continuous Trap card. Heals by only 500 so you can swap out Trickclown for bigger Aromage engine / Lightsworn Wulf if one wishes, but trickclown has higher early game consistency so I opted for that (Ofc brill fusion is in the deck)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a> - Searches a card which often time revives it (Garden Rose maiden) which is already a plus... on top of that it can revive Dragon synchros (Like crystal wing) or your maindeck rose dragons. You summon it mid combo for plussing</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a> - let there be plants</li> </ul> Dangers! <ul>  	<li>You don't need to many (even if they stop being semi-limited). You want level variety for synchro plays, so 2 Nessie, 2 Jackalope (best one), 1x Mothman, 1x Chupacabra (Yes I wanted 2 level 4s). Some cards in a deck benefit from being in graveyard. Overall nice engine</li> </ul> &nbsp;  1 card massive board engines <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Draconnet"">Draconnet</a> - Just check the video, Its like 2 minute long combo which ends up accessing lonefire blossom. Impressive board</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> - Any 1 card IB with vannila dragon combo does it. Obviously you send Carboneddon. Math can also send lots of useful stuff, + nice float eff</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> - Searches Draconnet or the <a data-name=""Catch Eve l2"">Catch Eve l2</a> (which is interesting free monster drop, also why I prefer this over Oviraptor engine)</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Some good cards <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""World Legacy guardragon"">World Legacy guardragon</a> u use this cards both effs, if you start with lonefire/Scorpio then you don't search this</li>  	<li><a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> if you start with Lonefire / scorpio then you search this because you are looking to revive lonefire (No worry Jasmine ll access it prior)</li>  	<li>2x Called by the grave - Duh</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Teny Spirit - Adhara"">Teny Spirit - Adhara</a> - If you control no eff monsters you can SS him... aka just drop him on an open board. Free level 1 tuner which is half of IB Justiciar</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>, works well with Draconnet, Dangers, one for one, brill fusion etc. Not as good with Aromaseraphy synchros but I hate Wulf.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Frozen Rose"">Frozen Rose</a> - so this card searches any plant in a game by sending non plant from the field to the graveyards (Hi dangers) but thats not why you run it SEARCHABLE by Red Rose dragon, you see it every game</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Brilliant Fusion"">Brilliant Fusion</a> - Send those light monsters!</li> </ul> Not so great cards but Engine pieces <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Gem Knight lazuli"">Gem Knight lazuli</a> - World Legacy Guardragon can revive it (Lazuli is level 3, Garnet is level 4, I prefered reviving level 3 more often)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a> - This card is a must because it + Red rose garden is aroma maiden. Thats a go to combo for this deck.

They are based around effects that activate when they are discarded from the hand to the graveyard by a card effect. The ""Danger!"" archetype aims to amass card advantage from the effects of the ""Danger!"" monsters, that force the opponent to discard a card from the ""Danger!"" player's hand. The strategy consists in the ""Danger!"" monsters revealing themselves in their owner's hand to activate their effects, then ""hiding"" in the hand again, making the opponent randomly discard a card from their opponent's hand. If they fail to ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, the monster is Summoned and a card is drawn. If they do ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, it triggers its discard effect, which varies from Special Summoning a ""Danger!"" monster from the Deck to destroying a card on the field. As such, the competitive potential of the Deck lies in the fact that activating a ""Danger!"" monster's effect will only rarely be a disadvantage to their user. Summoning several ""Danger!"" monsters in a turn isn't difficult and they can quickly perform an OTK, especially when combined with other archetypes, such as ""Dark World"", whose effects activate when they are discarded."

The ""Danger!"" archetype aims to amass card advantage from the effects of the ""Danger!"" monsters, that force the opponent to discard a card from the ""Danger!"" player's hand. The strategy consists in the ""Danger!"" monsters revealing themselves in their owner's hand to activate their effects, then ""hiding"" in the hand again, making the opponent randomly discard a card from their opponent's hand. If they fail to ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, the monster is Summoned and a card is drawn. If they do ""catch"" the ""Danger!"" monster, it triggers its discard effect, which varies from Special Summoning a ""Danger!"" monster from the Deck to destroying a card on the field. As such, the competitive potential of the Deck lies in the fact that activating a ""Danger!"" monster's effect will only rarely be a disadvantage to their user. Summoning several ""Danger!"" monsters in a turn isn't difficult and they can quickly perform an OTK, especially when combined with other archetypes, such as ""Dark World"", whose effects activate when they are discarded."

ANCIENT GEAR BALLISTIC SHOOTER DESKBOTS.,"Deck in action &gt;<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BxF0BHj1M8</a>  Card ratio explanations below:  Deskbots <ul>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> - Tuner of the deck, revives itself whenever 2 machines are summoned in the same time (Pendulum summon, Machine dup, Urgent schedule). One is really all you need, he enables Nat beast. Gains 500 for each machine (most of the deck is machine)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 002"">Deskbot 002</a> - Usually the most summoned deskbot, on summon searches a deskbot card (but there are no <strong>good</strong> deskbot spells / traps yet). Not OPT. He is so often summoned that a deck consistently abuses Mannequin cat. 500 + to all machines (most of your extra deck is machine). Reliant on other cards</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a> - The best normal summon in the deck, on summon summons another one from the deck. Quickplay attack boost of 500x deskbot cards you control. Easily the best card in your deck</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Deskbot 004"">Deskbot 004</a> - The best advantage maker in a deck, if he ever destroys a monster by battle you should win that game because he gets to swarm to then indirectly from the deck and from grave / hand. Gets huge by itself so can swing everything, Triggers Genius but not 001, can set another 004 for attack with 006</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Deskbot 005"">Deskbot 005</a> - Its all you need to make the infinity. Now there is a combo with triple 005 but thats a win more and it downgrades your decks consistency, yes 005 + machine dupe is weaker if you just play 2 but it doesn't matter there are 4 fantastic machine dup targets in a deck already. Revives when popped in scale</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Deskbot 006"">Deskbot 006</a> - This card scale matters more then 005 because it the opposite scale of Guitaars, but its really not the best draw, luckily the Ancient Gear link gives you more plusses so you end on a full scale way more often then before. Adds back deskbot card when popped in scale</li> </ul> I am not running 007, 008, 009. They are all bad bricks. Atleast 006  sets up for next turn with its add back. 008 can be cute in lategame when your graveyard is full but she overlaps with Infinitrack tunneler anyway, Redirecting targeting to itself doesn't matter no deskbot is to problematic to deal with other then in battle. 007 is just horrid scale as it works badly with guitars, by far the worst one. 009 is only good if you want a 1 card Djet with schedule or if you want to overkill your opponent, not enough uses.  Gear &amp; Track Engine <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Geargiauger"">Geargiauger</a> - This is 1 card GGX / AGear link. It plus around 15 cards in a deck (2 card combos) equals infinity. Restrictive but ups the deck consistency.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Geargiaccelerator"">Geargiaccelerator</a> - Its the brick you need for auger, if you open both its amazing</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern</a> - On summon searches ancient gear card (Ancient gear box) when ancient gear box is added to your hand you can search any machine with either 500 atk or 500 defense from your deck to your hand (Hi deskbots and infinitracks)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a> - Works if added from graveyard to hand discard it with guitaars revive it with Musashy or GGX, put it back in a deck with Tunneler</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""GearTown"">GearTown</a> - This card can be searched by link, it allows the link to drop a monster on top of searching 500/500 stuff when going second. You can also pop it with 005 or breaksword</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Catapult"">Ancient Gear Catapult</a> - If you can resolve this you have the infinity. I used to run it at 3 but now that we got Ancient gear link, Ancient gear engine is way more commonly used so I decided to cut 1. Works with all the scales (more consistent then in pure Agears tho not to consistent, 2 is like perfect). Graveyard effect comes in handy to, for link climbing popping 005, 006. Opening a way to resolve this card is great</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Infinitrack Tunneller"">Infinitrack Tunneller</a>  - has 500 defense. Tribute an earth machine to ss him. level 5 helps with infinity. Has Pot of Avarice eff for earth machines, which 97% of a time you get to proc turn 1 hopefully drawing handtraps.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> - Summons an earth machine from your hand on summon. just some swarming potential. has 500 defense.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Super express Bullet Train"">Super express Bullet Train</a> - Adds back an Earth machine at the end phase. Works with Qli Genius (Which is a lot more consistent due to new Ancient Gear link, also works with Urgent schedule. If you control an Earth Machine you can just summon him...... whats not to like.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> (THIRD sided) - Works only going second so just 2 in a maindeck. Triggers 001 as mentioned. Tuneller, 001, Train - best targets</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Symphonic engine <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Symphonic warrior Guitaars"">Symphonic warrior Guitaars</a> - Summons a tuner or / additonal normal summon from the deck</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Symphonic warrior Mics"">Symphonic warrior Mics</a> - Additional normal summon + level 5 machine. 2300 atk, if youd raw it with Guitaars you have a full scale</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Drumss"">Symphonic Warrior Drumss</a> - can become earth which is relevant for some Links and nat beast. level 2 tuner</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Other <ul>  	<li>Level 3 tuner handtraps (I run 5) - That way if you draw Mic + Guitaars you can pend summon them atleast</li> </ul> 3x <a data-name=""Machine duplication"">Machine duplication</a> - 003, Geargiauger, 004 + dup = infinity, 002, 005 if desperate.  &nbsp;  Extra deck Mandatory <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> - Evolution is beautiful</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> - You summon this card more then Cyber Dragons do.

I remember buying cards online one day and coming across a Level 6 DARK Machine Monster called <a data-name=""Timeater"">Timeater</a>.  The effect of Timeater simply stated that if it destroyed an opponent's monster by battle, your opponent would skip their Main Phase 1. A pretty unique effect if I do say so myself. I obviously knew the card wasn't great, but I simply <em>had</em> to build a deck based around it one day.  After failing miserably at a Regional with Tribute Stun, I focused a bit more of my time on building a Timeater deck. Around this time I had also discovered a Spell Card called <a data-name=""Terminal World"">Terminal World</a> which prevents both players from getting their second Main Phase. With these two cards, you can essentially skip your opponent's turn by destroying one monster, as your opponent is forced to go straight to their Battle Phase and then straight to their End Phase, meaning that the only cards they can play are Quick-Play Spells and Traps.  As I mentioned previosly, I had taken a Tribute Stun deck to a Regional, that deck comprised of a fairly large Monarch Engine, so I essentially rebuilt that deck but with Timeater in mind, and the decklist you can see on this page is the result of a lot of theorizing and playtesting.  The most basic way you can lock your opponent out of their turn requires an admittedly fairly specific board setup and 3 cards in your hand (only 1 of which is searchable). Those cards are <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>, Timeater and Terminal World, you also need a monster to tribute and your opponent cannot have a monster whose ATK is 1900 or more. Here is how to do the lock: <ol>  	<li>Tribute a monster to summon Timeater (you can also Tribute your opponent's monster if you have Stormforth).</li>  	<li>Play Black Garden and then Terminal World.</li>  	<li>Attack into your opponent's monster with Timeater. When the monster is destroyed Timeater's effect will activate, skipping the opponent's next MP1.</li>  	<li>Your opponent passes their turn</li>  	<li>You now need to summon any monster to your field without tributing Timeater, Black Garden will activate giving your opponent a token.</li>  	<li>Attack into the token, Timeater will activate again.</li>  	<li>Your opponent skips their turn.</li>  	<li>When it comes back to your turn you can now Tribute Summon for a Monarch or summon another low-level monster and keep the lock going.</li> </ol> Is it convoluted? Yes. Is it fun? Heck yeah.  Let me explain some specific choice cards and potential deck changes that could've been made:  <a data-name=""Caius the Shadow Monarch"">Caius the Shadow Monarch</a>: You can't rely soley on Timeater for the deck to work, you have to run some actual good monsters and Caius was still somewhat decent at the time when I played this deck. It's just good removal.  <a data-name=""Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch"">Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch</a>: I ran this specifically because it's good for the lockdown. Seeing as the Monarchs have mandatory effects, Caius isn't so good if your opponent doesn't have backrow, Thestalos however can be played regardless of what field your opponenet has. Hand Piercing also can be used outside of the combo to restrict the opponent. You can side out Thestalos for other Monarchs/Tribute Monsters if you're up against a deck that plays a lot of GY effects.  <a data-name=""March of the Monarchs"">March of the Monarchs</a>: This can definitely be replaced with <a data-name=""Return of the Monarchs"">Return of the Monarchs</a> if you like. My logic at the time of building this deck was that I have a lot of draw power as it is so it's very unlikely that I don't see any of my Tribute Monsters, so protection was probably a better idea for certain matchups.  <a data-name=""Chicken Game"">Chicken Game</a>: This was a card I didn't run in my Regional deck, but it makes a lot more sense to run, especially considering that I'm played 3 Terraforming and 3 Black Gardens anyway. I can simply get all the draws that I want and then prevent my opponent from using it by setting Black Garden.  <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>: Outside of the lock, this card is also pretty useful in other ways. It can create a small barrier for you if your opponent does a lot of Special Summoning, filling up your field with Tokens, and also those Tokens can be Tributed for Timeater or a Monarch if you need to. I'd recommend shutting off Black Garden first though. Another admittedly situational use would be if there are 3 Tokens on the field, you can destroy them to summon back 1 Monarch from your GY, giving more Tribute Fodder or Damage Output.  <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>: This was simply the last card I threw in, I built the deck specifically to go against Pendulum decks (which were mostly Majespecter at the time) and Solemn Warning hard counters them, but it's also just useful in general. However you can literally change this card up with anything else you want, be it another Monarch, a different Trap, more draw power etc.  The Extra Deck almost doesn't matter with this deck, hence why there are the Utopia cards in there, the only monsters I remember going into were <a data-name=""Gauntlet Launcher"">Gauntlet Launcher</a> and <a data-name=""Slacker Magician"">Slacker Magician</a>. Just play whatever Rank 6s you want.  And that's about it for this list, it's outdated now but at the time it managed to get me 3rd Place at my locals. I remember going up against someone playing Pendulums and locking them out for 5 turns which was pretty neat. But for the most part it plays like a basic Monarch Deck with Black Garden.

To support this, I added trap trick (works with generaider battle), lonefire blossom (works with mardell), and other generic draw cards. Generaider monsters used can be varied depends on your build, my personal choice is utgard (banishes things).  Next step is to make ip masquerena. Many engine can be used to summon this, but I chose trickstar and sangan. Trickstar has a lot of synergies, from candina is one card link 2 with corobane also searches reincarnation that can lock people with droll&amp;lock bird, light stage is searchable with terraforming too. For the sangan part, I accompanied it with the mentioned corobane and tour guide from underworld to make masquerena, sangan also searches droll and other handtraps if you happened to have droll already.  Now continuing to the real play, this deck often works on opponent's turn. I will explain phase by phase.  Draw phase: opponent's normal draw can trigger the field spell effect, so we can summon a generaider from deck+token to fill monster zone if the said generaider is summoned. The generaider summoned can be anything depends on situation (preferably utgard).  Standby phase: droll is online now, you can use its effect after resolving generaider battle. If you have trickstar reincarnation set, you can activate it before droll (activate generaider battle, on different chain: activate generaider field, chain trickstar reincarnation, chain droll) and voila trickstar hand ripping combo.  Main phase: your masquerena becomes online, it's preferred to summon generaider before main phase so u can link masquerena off in response to opponent's action. Card pool for masquerena to summon is many, as we have full field (tokens too). I prefer to summon knightmare to disrupt or unchained abomonation for big body and clearing boards.  Battle phase: if you dont have masquerena, this is the time to disrupt before they attack. You can activate generaider battle to activate field and do basic generaider combo then disrupt your opponent.  Main phase 2: not much, just watching them setting backrows.  End phase: unchained abomination works here, it destroys a card and if you still have generaider token, its destruction will trigger unchained abomination. So, 2 cards popped in the end phase.  Last but not least, the support/staples. Handtraps (good for disrupting, going second, also a link fodder with corobane), one day of peace (can trigger generaider field while giving you no damage if they battle your token), extravagance (draw cards, tested, you dont need most of the extra deck anyway), impermanence (handtrap, another target for trap trick), solemns (to prevent getting nibiru'd during your opponent's turn), cosmic cyclone (backrow removal), and called by the grave (negates hand traps).  Extra deck: preferably 3 copies each for the key cards (unchained abomination, masquerena, and knightmares) because extravagance, almiraj to trigger normal summoned sangan.  Side: depends on your matchup"

The deck is pretty consistent but relies a lot on searching so disruption can really break you. You want to set up the same board of Eternal Soul and Dark Magical Circle every game so playing some negates helps you get there. You do a lot of your summoning and tricks on your opponents turn.  I would never call this deck is competitive or strong but it is a lot of fun to play and you can really disrupt you opponent.  Between the Magician Navigations, Eternal Souls, and Magician of Dark Illusion you can easily summon a Dark Magician every turn and banish their cards if Dark Magical Circle is in play.  Using the Eye of Timeaus to summon Dark Magician The Dragon Knight protects your backrow and is in turn protected by the Eternal Soul creating a pretty tough board to deal with.  Make sure to take advantage of looping your Magicians Rods. When you summon a Dark Magician with Eternal Soul or Magician Navigation on your opponents turn, you can sacrifice it after it's summoned to grab a Magicians Rod. Rinse and repeat."

Raphion will only work in this case if your opponent has a monster with atleast 2000 atk assuming your opponent still has 8000 LP. Then you can use Michion and Raphion together in a situation like that  Sangan and Time Maiden are deck thinners as they will make the job faster  Although a FTK/OTK deck, it will still function pretty well in case you don't get the right cards at the right time. In that case you can use Time Maiden's powerful effect to her full potential  <strong>Strengths</strong>  Pretty much any deck that focuses on heavy beatdown and lacks the right defences to ""destroy"" the Timelords(Im looking at you Blue Eyes)  <strong>Weaknesses</strong> <ul>  	<li>Decks that focus on banishing instead of destroying</li>  	<li>Decks that negate effect monsters rendering Timelords completely useless</li>  	<li>Cards that tribute opponents monsters( F'ing Kaijus man)</li> </ul> <strong>In conclusion</strong>  I usually wait for a couple of turns to get the right cards and If I don't in that amount of time.I tend to play the game without focusing on achieving an OTK  Just so you know.A Blue Eyes Deck is completely powerless against this deck and there is like only one card that I know can be a problem dealing with it in The Blue Eyes Archetype.But people don't normally summon it so...moving on  You are free to change the cards in the deck to your playing style but if you have any ideas on how to improve it. Let me know  <strong>Quick Update</strong>  You can substitute Raphion with Sandaion if you do want to rely on your opponents monsters which will deal its own 2000 effect damage.The downside to this is that Sandaion is not really easy to search out through the deck buts its a small price to play. The fun part is that if somehow an opponent negates Sandaion's effect,they must now worry about the 4000 beatstick which got summoned with no tributes whatsoever, So Sandaion can still protect itself with its massive stats from battle(or used against you so becareful)"

I've seen most of the post chaos impact Tenyi have dropped the normal monsters, I kept them with the addition of Angel Trumpeter, I hope in the next set we see a Tenyi rank 4 normal monster along side the new big boss that protects your effect monsters.  The Danger! monsters are used as draw and dump support for the Tenyi in hand, its a win win with Mothman and Nessie if you get a monster dumped or if they do. Danger! cards are a bit to generic but I like the way they interact with the monsters in the deck more than just dumping 10 cards with Pot of Desires. I play tested this against Dragon of Red-Eyes and didn't have to bad of a time. I'm in the process of getting the deck core for Tenyi to start taking to locals, not too bad price point wise."

Davinator1212","I haven't had time to upload this deck profile because I've been busy this entire week but now I am able to upload it! Last weekend I went 6 rounds undefeated with my Pure Thunder Dragons deck at the Brooklyn NYC Regional and lost to an Altergeist player round 7 only because he won the die roll, then I lost to pure orcust and then won against another pure orcust, leaving my record at X2 and placing 13th place. This decklist is really good and doesn't really brick, if you know how to play this deck properly you can turn any hand into full combo, leaving you with at least a Titan and a Colossus which is normally enough to get you through your opponent's turn when you go first. With a really busted hand you can end with Apollousa, a Titian and/or Colossus. There are 2 ways to get this end result. The first is to summon <a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a> to mill <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonroar"">Thunder Dragonroar</a> and then using <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonhawk"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> in hand to summon the Roar from grave and get a token from Solar. Then tribute the token (since it is level 1) to get Linkurbioh in the extra monster zone. Then tribute Roar for Colossus and activate Roar to summon <a data-name=""Thunder Dragondark"">Thunder Dragondark</a>. After that use Colossus, Dark, Solar and Linkurbioh to bring out Apollousa, then use Dark to get <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Fusion"">Thunder Dragon Fusion</a> to get out Titan. The second way is doing all the same steps except whenever you summon Roar instead of going into Linkurbioh, use the Token and Roar to go into Lambda or Some Summer Summoner and special Dark off Roar then use those 3 for Apollousa. Also I really liked <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>, its an instant win against orcust and basically any other deck besides the mirror match. D. Shifter plus Batteryman Solar is full combo without Hawk. A lot more is explained in my deck profile from Davinator1212 since he was nice enough to give me a deck profile! The link is down below and I hope you guys enjoy this deck. Stick around for more :).  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhXtViB-JrM</a>  ^^^^^^^^^^^  My Top 16 Brooklyn Regional Deck Profile"

Don't expect anything from me. I made this just for fun :D</h4> &nbsp; <h2>Why Traptrix ?</h2> For the first time I heard about that Deck was on ""DevPro"". There was one guy who summoned ""Traptrix Myrmeleo"". My thoughts at that moment: ""Nice Artwork and a really nice effect. Why not build a Traptrix Deck ?  And at that day I read all the cards and tried to build a deck. 2 years ago I played ""Naturia Sacred Tree"". It special summoned an insect from the deck by tributing a plant. And it works also reverse (tribute plant, special insect) But now we have <strong>Traptrix Sera</strong> (she made this deck so srong!)  &nbsp; <h2>Pros</h2> + <strong>Great</strong> 1st turn boards  + Summon <strong>Traptrix Sera</strong> and profit!  + <strong>""Trap Trick""</strong> searches every trap you need <em>(but activate wisely!)</em>  + If your normal summon gets negated, that's no problem! <em>(because of Sera)</em>  + 1 Traprtrix monster + Shade Brigandine =<strong> Easy 2 card combo</strong>  + Sera is <strong>unaffected</strong> by trap effects <em>(if link summoned)</em>. That makes her really strong!  + <strong>Traptrix Rafflesia</strong> protects your Traptrix monsters! <em>(targeting, destruction)</em>  &nbsp; <h2>Cons</h2> - <strong>Weak</strong> against strong board decks  - If you can't summon <strong>Sera</strong>, you will have a hard time!  - You can easily make wrong choices <em>(miss timing, don't pay attention to your opponents cards, activate ""holes"" too early)</em>  - Weak against Denk Sekka <em>(rip traps)</em>  - If you don't see a Traptrix monster in your opening hand, you don't get card advantage  &nbsp; <h2>Why am I playing ""these"" cards ?</h2> <strong>- Artifact Moralltach ... </strong>Moralltach can be summoned by Artifact Sanctum <em>(obviously). </em>The good thing about that card is: It protects your <strong>Sera </strong>against battle <em>(special in battle phase to destroy your opponents monster)</em>  <strong>- 3x Traptrix Atrax ... </strong>Atrax is underrated. She can out <strong>""Red Reboot"" </strong>and that's awesome!! Reboot says, <strong>if the trap was negated, then... . </strong>If Atrax is on the field, normal trap cards activation and effects <strong>can not</strong> be negated. And you can also activate ""holes"" from your hand. Thats pretty neat! <strong>Traptrix Mantis</strong> can bounce your set ""hole"" and <strong>Atrax</strong> can activate it immediately!  <strong>- Compulsory Escape Device ... </strong>It says that each player have to choose 1 monster they control <em>(""choose"" is not target!!). </em>If you choose <strong>Sera</strong>, nothing happens to her and the opponents monster is shuffled into the deck <em>(it's really strong against many monsters nowadays). </em>Sera is <strong>unaffected</strong> by <strong>ALL</strong> trap effects. That means you can trigger Sera's special summon effect whenever you can.  <strong>- Galatea, the Orcust Automaton + Thunder Dragon Colossus ... </strong>Cherry targets <em>(obviously). </em>You have space in your extra deck.  <strong>- Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon ... </strong>Waking the Dragon ?  <strong>- Treacherous Trap Hole ... </strong>Many Traptrix players don't play this hole but <strong>I LOVE</strong> this card. You can search that card 1st turn with <strong>Myrmeleo </strong>and link summon to Sera. If your opponent has <strong>2 monsters</strong> on the field, thats great! <strong>Destroy</strong> these monsters and trigger Seras effect. But what if your opponent just has <strong>1 monster</strong> on the field ? Just target <strong>it</strong> and <strong>Sera</strong> <em>(she triggers and stays on the field)</em>, then you can special ""Dionaea"" from the deck and she sets the hole to your side (I don't recommend doing this, unless you are 100% sure that your opponent ends his turn)  &nbsp; <h2>Pro Tips</h2> <ul>  	<li>If you have <strong>Sera</strong> on the field and <strong>a trap card that can be activated</strong>, then you have a MST that turn. You can activate Lost Wind, the regular Compulsory and target Sera. Her effect activate to <strong>special</strong> a Traptrix monster from the <strong>deck</strong> <em>(Myrmeleo). </em>She can <strong>destroy</strong> a spell/trap on your opponents side. <em>(Sera's other effect triggers to set a hole from deck). </em>That tip is usefull especially against field spells or pendulum scales.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Always use <strong>Traptrix Mantis'</strong> effect in the <strong>end phase</strong> on your opponents turn if you have <strong>Sera</strong> on the field. You can target a ""dead"" trap card and <strong>DO NOT</strong> set that card <strong>because </strong>in your turn you can give the hole, <strong>that was set from Sera</strong>, to your hand and then you can set these 2 cards in <strong>any</strong> order you like. Your opponent <strong>DID NOT</strong> know where these traps are. Mantis can also <strong>""reset""</strong> the holes that was set from <strong>Dionaea </strong>last turn <em>(it prevents from banishing)</em></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li> <h3><em><strong>2 card combo</strong></em></h3> </li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><strong>Normal summon a Traptrix</strong>  <em>(best is Myrmeleo)</em></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li>Link summon to <strong>Sera</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li> Set Shade Brigandine<strong> then activate it immediately</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li><strong>Sera special Mantis</strong> <em>(you <strong>always</strong> special her because you can easily set a<strong> trap and activate her bounce effect</strong> to trigger <strong>Sera</strong>. If you have <strong>0 traps</strong> in hand, just special summon Myrmeleo and <strong>trigger</strong> Myrmeleos effect. <strong>IT WORKS</strong>)</em></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li><strong>Trigger</strong> Seras <strong>other</strong> effect to set a hole from deck -&gt; XYZ to <strong>Rafflesia</strong></li> </ul> -&gt; <ul>  	<li>Set all your <strong>traps</strong> and thats it!</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2><strong>Match-ups</strong></h2> <ul>  	<li><strong>vs. Sky Striker ´... </strong>You can easily play against <strong>""There Can Be Only One""</strong>. Normal summon <strong>Dionaea</strong> <em>(plant)</em>, special<strong> Mymeleo</strong><em> (insect)</em> to destroy that card</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Thunder Dragon ... </strong>Side<strong> ""Time-Space Trap Hole"" </strong>to return them to the extra deck. And try to let him <strong>no thunder</strong> monsters on the field!</li>  	<li><strong>vs. True Draco ... </strong>Easy match-up. Just destroy the field spell and they can't do much.<strong> Sera</strong> and <strong>Rafflesia</strong> were <strong>unaffected</strong> by thei<strong>r continious traps</strong> and <strong>Rafflesia</strong> also <strong>force</strong> him to target her. Play <strong>3 Bottomless</strong> and win.</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Cyber Dragon ... </strong>Don't let him <strong>contact fuse</strong> with <strong>Sera</strong>. If you follow this rule you<strong> win</strong>. (xD)</li>  	<li><strong>vs. Dino ... </strong>You have a hard time against this deck. Miscellaneousaurus ist just too strong. Your holes are pretty much dead.

Coming in Mystic Fighters set.","Mathmech Processor Final Sigma is a synchro lv12 which can be summoned via malefic engine (surprsingly, it's the only lv12 synchro target for malefic archetype).  First step is to aim for the cards like malefic cyber-end dragon on hand and parallel gear on field. To acompolish this, you can use paradox gear effect. Paradox gear is easily searched/summoned by cards like: malefic world, malefic selector (read its condition first), one for one, where arf thou (using sky striker token as condition), and platinum gadget (summoned using sky striker engine).  As a secondary strategy, this deck can use basic malefic beat-up. So, you need field spell to acommodate that. Field besides malefic world, like sky striker area zero (searchable with engage) and trickstar lighstage (searchable with candina, good for going 2nd) are recommended. Malefic territory is a must, as it can search malefic world and disable ur malefc monsters downside effect. Also dont forget terraforming and set rotation.  Aside for summoning platinum gadget, the sky striker engine can be used to break board too. The rest of the main deck are just handtraps or cards used to break board (monster and/or backrow). The cards listed are just example and the ratio is up to you. You can use any break board cards based on matchup/your likings.  Extra deck: mathmech processor final sigma, cyber end dragon, stardust dragon, platinum gadget, hayate, kagari, shizuku, malefic paradox dragon (lv10 synchro), dragocytos nethersoul (big body, another lv10 synchro target for parallel gear+stardust), and the rest are generics with big body or to break board.  PS: some cards are not available on tcg yet (example malefic selector)"

(UPDATED","Odd-eyes archetype is only known as a part of pendulum strategy, but in reality it holds more than just summoning vortex dragon and other 50 negates. Every odd-eyes card has built-in break board/damage dealer effect, this deck will capitalize that sector to its full potential.  Strategy is to have lair of darkness on the field and then tributing opponent's monster for odd-eyes wizard dragon (it floats too, +2). To do that, we need searchers like spiral flame strike (searches lv7 odd-eyes or break board), sky iris (searches odd-eyes monster), terraforming and set rotation (both search lair or sky iris), ahrima (searches lair).  Odd-eyes has variety of cards that we can use as supports, such as odd-eyes dragon (wizard dragon requirement, damage dealer), arc pendulum dragon (extends ur pendulum play), revolution dragon (searches dark dragon pendulum monster), persona dragon (negates extra deck monster effect), odd-eyes mirage dragon (protection, scale 8), pendulum dragon (double battle damage) and odd-eyes fusion (material from extra deck). Other cards to complement this strategy are supreme king package (darkwurm, gates, foolish/dragon shrine; extends pendulum play), darkest diabolos (can be searched with foolish/dragon shrine), pendulum fusion (material from pendulum scale), and phantazmay (dark dragon lv7, fixes hand). The rest of the main deck cards are only to disrupt opponent like handtraps or breaking board cards.

Simple as that</li> </ul> <strong>However</strong>  Getting Appropriate in your hand on your first turn is a rather slim chance of 3/40 so you make the calculation. And activating it is another tough task so how can you speed things up?  <strong>You stall</strong>  Mystic Mine is your best friend when it comes to this deck as many duelists out there focus more on monster effects rather than destroying traps and spells  Mystic Mine is pretty much the child of Swords of Revealing Light and Skill Drain and it takes this one card to completely shut down your opponent  <strong>There are two ways to activate Appropriate in this deck,you either</strong> <ul>  	<li>Wait for your opponent to activate a spell or trap and negate it with Dark Bribe</li>  	<li>Force your opponent to draw two cards using either cup of ace(Pray for it to land on tails) or Gift of greed</li> </ul> and after that you are free to activate other draw cards like Dark World Dealings and Hand Destruction to draw out your entire deck  <strong>Word of Advice</strong> <ul>  	<li>I usually use 2 appropriates on the field to draw out cards on a much faster rate. Using three of them is overkill as two appropriates is more than enough</li>  	<li>Becareful when using a deck like this because you will run into duels where instead of winning by the effects of Exodia, You deck out yourself on accident by the on going effect of appropriate to draw 2 cards.</li>  	<li>But in all honesty, I just love the sight of drawing so many cards in a single turn so I sometime use 3 of them at the same time occasionally</li> </ul> <strong>In conclusion</strong>  The deck is pretty fun to play with as I usually play it for casual duels when I am not into serious mode. I know there are other more efficient Exodia decks out there but drawing cards until you have about 30 cards in your hand is pretty funny to me.  The deck is not easy to set up but hey...who said life was easy anyway?  &nbsp;"

Jack A' Booran and Yuki-musume help tie the Zombie World stuff and the Mayakashi stuff together so that it all works out better than you'd expect. Uni-Zombies provide an alternative normal summon to Hajun when you brick as it can potentially help you get a Mayakashi ladder going depending on your opening, or it can allow you to rush for Balerdroch. Thanks to the new Mayakashi link-4 the deck has solid control properties that combined with Balerdroch and Gravity Collapse make for a strong going-first deck (when you don't brick) that can also easily go second and do some unga bunga zombie caveman beatdown. The deck gets absolutely eaten alive by handtraps and disruption in general, so 3 Called By the Grave are mandatory. I opted to include 4 revival traps as they play nicely with the Mayakashi synchros to use their revival effects as quick-effects, but the Buddy Forces are only my personal preference and could very easily be replaced with Ash Blossoms or something else if so desired. Return of the Zombies also makes for solid removal with Zombie World up, and its general utility and re-usability makes it a staple card IMO. The side deck is basically just all staples, really run whatever you want. You could also alternatively play 3x Give and Take in place of Gravity Collapse as they both accomplish similar goals of preventing any fun, but Gravity Collapse is generally more potent.  &nbsp;  Overall the deck is decently versatile and a lot of fun to play (although admittedly it's kinda annoying in YGOpro because of Dakki). Somewhat weak consistency and a limited extra deck hold back the deck a tad, but Mayakashis have more than enough tools to deal with a wide variety of situations."

There's also a lot of other things you can to with this deck as example you can use </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">gemini</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> ablation to bring your </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">gemini</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> monsters faster without even using your normal summon, you can use the effect of your catalyst field to disrupt your opponent field or even burn your opponent life points out using the Red-eyes Black Flare Dragon, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon(that is why you have the Summoned skull on the deck) and Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon. There are also some cards focused on recycling your red-eyes monster from your graveyard such as Return of the red-eyes, Red-eyes spirit and some monsters like </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">TheBlak</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> Stone of Legends and the Previously mentioned Archfiend Black Skull Dragon.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}""> </span>  <span data-contrast=""auto"">Another really useful cards are the Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and Red-Eyes Archfiend of </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Lightining</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">.

The later one helps you to mass destruct your opponent monsters even if they have high defense if you equip it with bBlack Metal Dragon or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword, that can be brought to the field using The Claw of </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Hermos</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> and any other monster on the deck.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}""> </span>  Beyound all that you still have Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon that is a great card for this deck and the only reason you want to have Dark Magician on this deck to be able to summon it using your Red-Eyes Fusion."

Be advised this deck has only 1 play if made to go first but you should NEVER GO FIRST. Only go second. If you go first summon 2 of your math mechs and go into link devotee and link disciple. Make I:P and pass, using her to make unicorn on your opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  Going Second your basic combo is to use Nabla to special summon Multiply. Then use any of your 3 free summons (Additions, Subtraction, or Sigma) and use Multiply effect on itself or Sigma. Remember Nabla and Sigma are your tuners so you need one of them and Multiply. Now synchro into Final Sigma, triggering Multiply's effect in the GY. Target Final Sigma to make it 6k and go attack. Your opponent can activate any trap or monster effect, but it won't matter because Final Sigma is unaffected. You should be able to deal over 8k damage this way. This deck uses Nibiru &amp; Kaijus to get rid of big boards and pesky monsters like bagooska or apollousa.  &nbsp;  A word of caution, this deck is VERY weak to Called by the Grave. This is why we run Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion. Ghost belle will negate Called by so Sigma can special itself, Division can resolve, and Multiply can make you win. You should be able to make the Final Sigma OTK by summon 4 or 5 so you're safe from Nibiru. Be cognizant of your normal summon; you should only be normal summoning Nabla and Multiply but try to keep either Nabla or Sigma since they're your only Tuners."

Any extender can be used to summon predap anaconda for dragun of red-eyes and frog extenders for toadally awesome. If u didnt have extender for predap/toadally, it means ur deck is still stacked with rank-up 7th on the top thanks to rebarian shark, therefore you can summon c101 directly next turn (SHARK INTENSIFIES). With MR5 coming, the bahamut shark spam version is better than this mermail variant, so I have to put this in non-meta category.  Most of the cards are just to summon saryuja while being water and lv4.  Complimentary cards: dark magician (fusion material), vanilla red-eyes (fusion material, following the new archetype fusion ruling), red-eyes fusion (predap target), moray and salvage (for the plus), called by the grave (negates monster handtrap), abyss-scale mizuchi (negates spell, esp super poly if it's the first spell used).  Extra deck: basic combo cards. dracossak and linkuriboh are used just in case u have monster with the same name (lv7s or lv1s) so u can summon saryuja."

This is usually reached by turn 2 or early turn 3, but turn 1 your board will most likely be partially full of aggressive backrow.  <strong>Majespecter</strong> <strong>Supercell </strong>is your key card. It recycles 5 of your Majespecter cards from your GY into the Deck, then draws a card for you. It also protects any Majespecter cards activated on your field from being negated, this also grants protection against cards like <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> and <strong>Skill Drain</strong>, even <strong>Destiny HERO Plasma</strong>. It can also trick your opponent into using one of their negations, essentially wasting it since this card is active. The trick to using this card, <strong>chain it with a Majespecter Spell/Trap card</strong>. Your opponent will negate the first card, then the effect of Supercell will cancel it and therefore baiting out a free negate. Supercell 95% of the time will become a destruction target, though, so be careful.  <strong>Ties of the Brethren </strong>is an excellent card, as it can basically special summon 2 Majespecter monsters from your Deck. White Wing Magician is also a card target, since all of them are WIND Spellcaster-type monsters that are level 4 (except for Nekomata and Raccoon). The best way to use this is by targeting a Yata, Kybui, or Ogama.  <strong>Majesty's Pegasus is a 1 or 2 turn useful Field</strong> <strong>Spell. </strong>Most of the time, you will need to use it to special summon Bunbuku from the Deck to add another Majespecter monster. DO THIS, as you can search either a low scale or high scale monster you need to make your scale set.  Once you have at least 2 or 3 Majespecter monsters, you can easily replace this with <strong>Secret Village of the Spellcasters </strong>to lock your opponent out of using Spell cards.  <strong>All Majespecter monsters have target and destruction immunity from your opponent. </strong>Use this to your advantage! You'll NEVER have to worry about cards such as Cyber Dragon Infinity, Kozmo Dark Destroyer, etc any monster that has an effect that allows them to target or destroy your Majespecter monsters. Additionally, monsters that can negate card effects are also a careless factor, as long as you have <strong>Majespecter Supercell</strong> active!  <strong>Unchained Abomination is your boss monster.</strong> ALWAYS go into this card with <strong>I:P Maquerena</strong> and give it destruction immunity. This can be done easily by using 2 monsters to summon her, then her plus 2 others to summon Unchained Abomination. You can also even do this BEFORE pendulum summoning, as usually your opponent own't have any monsters *cough* Tornado... *cough* Tempest.. *cough* that can beat over yours. (Masquerena can also Link summon during your opponent's Main Phase, consider this if you want)  <strong>Majespecter Tempest is your searchable Solemn Strike.</strong> Use Kyubi and Ogama's effects to search/set this card to your field. This card is your FREE Solemn Strike that can be searched up to 3 times per turn (+ Nekomata's effect). Turn 1, you want at least 1 or 2 copies of this card in your backrow, which is highly possible. (If you use Ties of the Brethren on Yata or White Wing Magician, summon both Kyubi and Ogama to get these cards easily).  <strong>Be very careful of anything that changes monster type and/or attributes on the field. </strong>Majespecters HEAVILY rely on them being themselves, as all their Spell/Trap cards require a WIND Spellcaster-type monster to be tributed in order to activate. This means cards such as <strong>Zombie World, Buster Dragon, both DNA Trap cards, Lair of Darkness,</strong> etc can instantly shut down your offense. Try to use Solemn Judgement very wisely, and don't forget to use Phoenix or Unicorn from the Extra Deck to rid any problems cards should they show up.  <strong>Grave of the Super Ancient Organism </strong>is pretty much self-explanatory. It stops all level 6 or higher special summoned monsters on the field from attacking or using their effects. This card stuns many popular monsters such as <strong>Rainbow Neos, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon, D/D/D Abyss King Ragnarok, </strong>etc. Even fully stunning decks such as <strong>Odd-Eyes, Blue-Eyes, Red-Eyes, HEROES. </strong>All Majespecter monsters are levels 4 and 3, plus your big monsters are Link monsters. Use this card once its absolutely necessary, as you still have the potential to summon <strong>Quintet Magician</strong> and wipe your opponent's board before you activate it, as it effects ALL monsters, not just your opponent's.  <strong>By turn 2 or turn 3, your board will consist of the following, and this is your IDEAL winning board:</strong>  Secret Village of the Spellcasters - 3 Majespecter monsters, Unchained Abomination, Borrelsword Dragon - Majespecter Supercell(active), 2 Majespecter Tempest, Majespecter Tornado, Majespecter Cyclone.  Your attack will be using Borrelsword Dragon's effect on a Majespecter monster, switching it to Defense position and gaining itself a second attack. For a total of 6000, finish your opponent with Unchained Abomination for the final 3000 blow.  &nbsp;  <em>~This is an MR3-based deck. It can still be powerful in MR4, but will be more difficult to achieve~</em>"

The Deck mostly revolves around stalling with Subterror Cards until you can OTK with <a data-name=""Gren Maju Da Eiza"">Gren Maju Da Eiza</a> or <a data-name=""Golden Homunculus"">Golden Homunculus</a>.  I deliberately put 48 cards in since it seems to work well as a ratio when running 3 <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>.  The <a data-name=""Golden Castle of Stromberg"">Golden Castle of Stromberg</a> Engine I run has 4 Entry Points (<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, <a data-name=""Glife The Phantom Bird"">Glife The Phantom Bird</a>, 2x Golden Castle) and for the Cost of your Normal Summon gives you a 2800 Body and a crush in Form of <a data-name=""Hexe Trude"">Hexe Trude</a> from the Deck.  The <a data-name=""Subterror Guru"">Subterror Guru</a> Engine is reduced, but does a very good job of Stalling and can single-handedly win you the Game in a good Matchup.  I play 3 Gren Maju and additionally 2 Golden Homunculus to draw them consistently even though I banish most of my Cards. Additionally I can search Gren Maju with Gold Sarcophagus. Golden Homunculus is a good addition to Gren Maju in my oppinion. It does take one Tribute to be summoned but being almost exactly as good at OTKing as Gren Maju makes it worth it (Gren Maju reaches (8000 ATK at 20 banished Cards, Golden Homunculus reaches 8100 ATK at 22 banished Cards).  <a data-name=""Eater of Millions"">Eater of Millions</a> and <a data-name=""Gizmek Oroshi"">Gizmek Oroshi</a> consistently banish lots of cards and remove enemy monsters.  <a data-name=""Necroface"">Necroface</a> can come in clutch and win you the game with your back against the wall. I am still thinking about cutting it.  <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> is the perfect draw spell to run in a Gren Maju Deck, nuff said.  <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> is at one because I need a lot of my Extra Deck, still the Tradeoff (Extra Deck Strength -&gt; Momentum) is often very much worth it.  <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is amazing at removing Enemy Monsters so I dedicated most of my Extra Deck to it for maximum removal coverage.  An effectively resolved <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper"">Ghost Reaper</a> is going to win you the Game in a lot of cases that's why i put it in.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is a turbo for <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi"">Gizmek Orochi</a>.  Have fun driving your friends up the wall. Don't be a dick."

Slow progress, with big potential.","This deck is basically made to counter annoying cards like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Chaos%20Ancient%20Gear%20Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant</a> , <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blue-Eyes%20Chaos%20MAX%20Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> , <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evil%20HERO%20Malicious%20Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a> . This deck has a actually slow proegress, you have to survive 3-8 turns, depending on your starting hand, to actually get into the fun part.  You have like 2 different main strategy stages. But before that, you actually have to get your key cards on the field or at least into the graveyard. Through cards like Armageddon Knight, Foolish Burial or especially Dark Grepher you can fill your GY with Yubel (1st form) and Diabolos, Lord of the Lair.  <strong>First stage/strategy:</strong>  You have Yubel and Lair of Darkness on your field. Your opponent can't attack you, better said shouldn't. You can crosstribute once a turn through effects of Ahrima, the wicked Warden, Diabolos or Yubel with the effect of Lair of Darkness. The effects of Lair also apply for Hand of Nephthys and you can also get rid of annoying monsters with Super Polymerisation because as long as Lair is on the field every face-up monster becomes Dark.  <strong>Caution! </strong>In your end phase you can decide in what order you can activate the effect of Yubel, Yubel - Terrorincarnation and Lair of Darkness. Done right you shouldn't worry about potential threads of the tokens (piercing damage) or a thin wall of indestructable monsters.  <strong>Second stage/strategy:</strong>  If you have Yubel - Terrorincarnation on your field, and the most annoying monster of the enemy are tributed or used as fusion materials, your next goal should be to summon at least 1 Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys. This whole loop should be self explaining and already known. Just read the effects of those 2 monsters.  <strong>Useful information:</strong> <ol>  	<li>You should be cautios about the effect chaining, because occasionally, because of the ruling, there won't be an opportunity, to special summon the next form of Yubel. Quick example: Your opponent plays a Thunder Dragon deck. Yubel's effect activates, your opponent chains an Quick Effect discarding a monster from the hand (Thunder Dragondark) and chains the effect of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Thunder%20Dragon%20Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>. Yubel is destroyed but that wasn't the last action in the chain - there won't be an opportunity to special summon Yubel - Terrorinc.</li>  	<li>The hand traps should be adjusted to the enemy's deck - if you know what he is playing.</li>  	<li>You should always have a really good and fast start if you play with customized rules (fun duels) - e.g. 6 cards in starting hand/2 per draw.</li>  	<li>Deep Dark Trap Hole can't be used if a XYZ is summoned, because they don't have a common rank/level (it's an XYZ level).</li>  	<li>If you have the chance or want to expand the deck with banned cards I'd recommend at least 3x Pot of Greed and Noble Charity.</li>  	<li>This deck has currently no possibility to negate effects of face-up monsters and cards.</li>  	<li>You can use Last Turn (banned) as a last resort, if you have one of the Yubels on the field, because as soon as the opponent attacks, Yubel is inflicting effect damage and not battle damage. Just be aware of the fact that without Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare it will most of the time and in a draw, if the opponent's life points won't hit 0. The rulings of Last Turn are long and complicated: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Last%20Turn"">Rulings of Last Turn.</a></li> </ol> Have fun and I'd appreciate some feedback ;)"

Today's deck features the Harpie Ladies combined with the Simorghs, both whom are Winged Beasts. The overall goal of this deck is that by the end of your turn, you'll have a field with a high-level Winged Beast such as <a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">, or will have </a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Kings"">Simorgh, Bird of Kings</a><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Kings""> ready. Harpies play an assisting role in getting everything set up, and the Simorghs play the result.</a>  <b>COMBOS</b><strong>:</strong>  ""Harpie Channeler"" + ""Harpie Perfumer"" + ""Elegant Egotist"": Summon Harpie Channeler first. Then use her effect to Special Summon Perfumer. From there, use Perfumer's effect to add Elegant Egotist (if not in your hand). Finally, use Elegant Egotist to Special Summon a Harpie Lady or Sisters (most likely Sisters). From there, you can Link Summon into Simorgh, Bird of Kings or any other Link Monster (or Utopia).  ""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"" + ""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"" + ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"": (can only be done if your opponent's S&amp;T Zone is empty) Activate Elborz. Summon Calamity, then use the effect to send Bringing to the Graveyard. Activate Bringing's effect to SS itself from the Graveyard. Elborz's effect will allow you to summon another Winged Beast while you control a Winged Beast. Tribute the two to Summon Simorgh Storm or Apex.  ""Wynn the Wind Medium"" + ""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"" + ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh""+ ""Mist Valley Apex Avian"" + ""Simorgh of Darkness"": Activate Wynn's effect from the hand and discard any WIND monster to search for Calamity. Normal Summon Calamity and use its effect to send Darkness to the Graveyard. Activate Elborz and use its 1st effect and reveal Apex. Then, use 2nd effect to tribute Calamity for Apex. Darkness's effect will trigger and will allow you to SS itself.  ""Divine Wind of Mist Valley"" + ""Harpie Dancer"" + ""Harpie Perfumer"": Activate Divine Wind first. Then, Normal Summon Dancer. Use Dancer's effect to return herself to the hand and summon herself again (or another WIND Monster). Then use Divine Wind's trigger effect to SS Perfumer. Activate Perfumer to add Elegant Egotist and use it to SS Sisters. From there, you can Link Summon into Simorgh, Bird of Kings.  (more combos exist, but that is up to you to find out :)  <strong>NOTE: </strong>  To be able to thoroughly use Simorghs effectively, it is best to make sure your opponent has no Spells or Traps in their S&amp;T Zone. This can be done with Repulsion or Trunade.  Borreload Savage Dragon and Hop Ear Squadron are included in the Side Deck in case you'd like to throw a Synchro into the Deck.  I placed a 2nd Harpie Lady Sisters in the Side because of space and to avoid bricks. It can be switched with any card in the deck if you think it works best when runned on two.  If your planning on summoning the Simorgh Link Monster, its best you go first. Otherwise going first or second is fine.

At locals I did just kinda okay with it, but for the Regional I wanted a much better list.  So I went ahead and bought more structure decks: This time I got cards from Order of the Spellcasters and Rokket Revolt and built this list for the upcoming regional. My final result of that regional was 69th place (out of 105-ish players) with 2 wins, 2 losses and 3 draws.  So if you're looking for a super budget Zombie Deck to build, the entire main deck can be purchased for roughly $40 and the Extra Deck only really needs Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon which you can get from the Structure Deck also. My regional list did use a Side Deck and much larger Extra deck with the cards that I had at the time, but I barely used anything from my Extra Deck and the Side Deck is completely up to you if you want to construct one."

The deck is pretty consistent because it has many search effects included.  Some monsters can be summoned easier, if there is already a “Photon/Galaxy”-Monster on your side of the field. So its important to get any monster on board without using your normal summon.  For the extra Deck you can play nearly all Rank 4/8 XYZ, as well as a variety of Link Monsters. In this profile I only show my selection.  The Side Deck can be filled with backrow removal, floodgates, handtraps and other “Galaxy“-cards  Here a short description for the Main Deck cards:  Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon:  Important for Rank 8. Summoning/Effect-Condition for some other cards, especially because he got the „Photon“ and „Galaxy“ in its name. The own effect is nearly irrelevant.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Knight:  Most important normal summon and a one-card-Rank 8. Can be searched, so i advise to play only 2 copies to avoid bricky hands, playing 3 is also possible (especially when also playing Pot of Desires)  &nbsp;  Galaxy Brave:  Free special summon, requires a „Photon“-Monster in hand. Material for Rank 8 or Rank 4, also can be a good beatstick. Hard once per turn, so I only play 2.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Soldier:  Searches all „Galaxy“-Monsters. Discard the Photon Dragon for the effect of Galaxy Knight. Soldier is also an easy way to Cyber Dragon Infinity.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Wizard:  Also a normal summon. Searches any „Galaxy“-Card. Great combo extender, but normal summoning him may conflict with the Knight. You can also play 1 or 3 copies if you want to.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Cleric:  Good card for turn 2/3. Recycles cards and lets you draw 2. Can be sided out if necessary (or cut completely).  &nbsp;  Photon Vanisher:  Free Special Summon when you control any „Photon/Galaxy“-Monster. Searches the Photon Dragon and is perfect material for a Rank 4 or Link.  &nbsp;  Photon Advancer:  Also a free special summon for a rank 4 or Link, but needs a „Photon“-Monster on field. I prefer him instead of Photon Thrasher, because Trasher usually bricks after turn 1. Playing Thrasher is still an option you may consider in your build.  &nbsp;  Photon Orbital:  Most important searcher in the deck. Can search any „Galaxy/Photon“-Monster. Is also an equip for ATK boost and battle protection.  &nbsp;  Spells:  Photon Sanctuary  2 Photon-Tokens, free Solflare Dragon, no once per turn…nothing more to say  &nbsp;  Galaxy Expedition:  Summons one high-lvl Monster from your deck. Great combo extender. I advise definitely playing a playset.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Trance:  Also a great combo extender or comeback card, but needs graveyard setup and blocks you from summoning Cyber Dragon Infinity. Playing a playset is possible, but not necessary imo.  &nbsp;  Galaxy Zero:  Searchable Monster Reborn.  &nbsp;  Reinforcement of the army:  For searching Vanisher and Advancer.  &nbsp;  Monster Reborn:  Monster Reborn  ;)  &nbsp;  Called by the grave:  We got many searches and combos, so we have to protect us from handtraps. Can also be an interruption in your opponents turn.  &nbsp;  Trade In:  Draw power. We play many lvl 8. We can easy discard the Photon Dragon for Knight’s effect.  &nbsp;  Tachyon transmigration  One more negation for all your opponents effects in one chain. Needs a Galaxy-Eye Monster on our field to be activated. Can also be sided out or bumped to 3."

So basically how the deck works is you have to ritual summon Revendread Slayer and Vendread Battlelord asap and use battlelord's effect to shutdown the hand traps and proceed to make the 4 solid interruptions, and after that ... you know what! that will take a lot of boring writings so it would be better if i show you in a video, i put it at the Youtube channel "" VCY [Vendread-Combo-Ygopro]"" under the name ""3 cards combo demonstration [vendread-impcantaion-zombie]"" as well, also if you'd LIKE  to see the deck in action vs meta, you can find it at the same Youtube channel under the name ""【YGOPRO】VENDREAD VS META + DECK LIST 2020 FT.

Fun and","Thunder dragon deck is one of the best deck in current format. Its pure version is specialized in fusion summoning while spewing out some generic link monster. This deck will take the pure version with different approach while maintaining the real deck consistency. While MR5 format boosts this deck playstyle, the new banlist hurts this deck consistency, so I have to put this in non-meta category.  For starter we need to get chain material (the most important, lets u fusion summon using main deck as material) and necro fusion (generic fusion trap). Chain material bypasses the ""..banish the material from gy face down.."" on necro fusion, so any material will be monster from main deck, hand, and/or gy banished face-up. It means any thunder dragon banished effect (3 monster effects if u fusion titan) will trigger during ur opponent's turn, maximizing the card advantage for thunder dragon. To do this, cards like lilith (searches both chain material and necro fusion) and trap trick (searches both, but shouldnt be used to search chain material cus it limits u to only use one trap after trap trick resolved).  The remaining main deck cards are just basic thunder dragon package cards (including aloof lupine, batteryman solar, allure of darkness, and gold sarc). Support cards like impermanence (handtrap, another trap trick target) and ash blossom (handtrap) are great to boost this deck.  Extra deck: thunder dragons, clotheep (gives free below lv4 monster after u ss fusion monster), predap anaconda (lets u use thunder dragon fusion from deck while dumping the card to gy), and linkuriboh (opens up extra zone using thunder dragonmatrix) are essential. The rest are just good generic link monster."

The goal is to force your opponent to triggert the float-effects of your Krawlers to consistently generate advantage and swarm the field with Insect-Monsters.  All your lvl-2-Krawlers let you special summon 2 other Krawlers from your Deck if they leave the field by an opponents card effect. The Link-Monsters also float by reviving two Krawlers from your Graveyard when they leave the field by nearly any reason.  Duels with Krawlers can take a long time, but if you „survive“ the first wave of your opponents card effect, you have decent chances to win the match.  The Deck is absolutely not meta relevant, but against other Fun/Rogue Decks it can be pretty solid. Many Decks struggle against float-heavy strategies and don’t have an out for it. BTW I have a high win rate against Pendulum Decks, I don’t really know why, but it works.  Best counters to this Deck are backrow-removal-cards (Twin Twister, Cosmic Cyclone,…) and graveyard-blocking (Abyss Dweller, Necrovalley,…). Also Utopia The Lightning is perfect, because he stops Krawlers activating their effects while its attack.  Here I’ll show you my Main Deck choices and give a short description. The variant shown is a pure Deck, that is not ment to be an Anti-Strategy. If you prefer palying flootgates, Superpolymerisation or anything else you can go for these cards too.  &nbsp;  3x <strong>Krawler Spine, Receptor and Glial:</strong>  These are imo the most important Krawlers. They destroy monsters, search new Krawlers and special them from your hand or graveyard. I wouldnt play less than 3 each.  &nbsp;  2x <strong>Krawler Axon, Dentrite and Deus Ex:</strong>  They are used to destroy spells/traps, mill monsters (not only Krawler!) and shut down your opponents monster effects. Deus doesn’s have the swarm effect, but is a walking skill drain for your opponents monster effects and a winning condition on its own. These three are situational, so i prefer playing only 2.  &nbsp;  1x <strong>Krawler Ranvier:</strong>  Can be good in grind game, because he let’s you recycle dead Krawlers. You don‘t want to draw him turn one, so 1 is enough  &nbsp;  2x <strong>Block Spider</strong>:  One more swarming tool. One spider specials another spider when specialed. These two could brick if you draw both or banish one with pot of desires, but imo thats fine. Usually this is a two-card Link-option. Can be sided or cut if necessary.  &nbsp;  1x <strong>Glow up Bulb:</strong>  You want to mill it with Dentrite. Swarming tool and gives you the option for Naturia Beast.  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells:</strong>  3x <strong>World Legacy in Shadow:</strong>  Let’s you swarm more insects (also enables the Block Spider) and removals your opponents attacking monsters without targeting or destroying. You don’t necessarily need terraforming, cause it’s already searchable. If you play against krawlers, try to out this card before you go into battle phase!  &nbsp;  3x <strong>World Legacy Survivor:</strong>  Basically the best card of your Deck. You reveal the Top 5 cards of your deck, add one („Krawler-“ or „World Legacy“-Card) and mill the rest. Perfect for setup your graveyard.  &nbsp;  3x <strong>Worm Bait and Scapegoat:</strong>  Token-generate-cards that can both be used for Link summoning. I prefer playing as much as possible, because they are not searchable and could be milled by Survivor or banished with Pot of Desires.  &nbsp;  1x <strong>One for one:</strong>  Enables the Block Spiders/Glow up Bulb. Could be sides/cut.  &nbsp;  2x <strong>Pot of Desires:</strong>  We play enough Krawlers and don’t have „That“ key card we could accidently banish, so it’s a free plus 1.  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps:</strong>  3x <strong>World Legacy Pawns:</strong>  You want to see this card first turn! Let’s you flip your Krawlers face up/down to activate their flip effects. You can also bait your opponent if he activates cards with removal effects. Just flip one random Krawler face up and his swarm effect will be triggered.  &nbsp;  3x <strong>World Legacy‘s Mind Melt:</strong>  Forces your opponent to removal your face-up Krawler and triggert he swarm effect. Also specials a Krawler from your Deck into a zone a Link-Monster points to.  &nbsp;  3x <strong>Lost Wind:</strong>  Effect negation, ATK-manipulator and can be recycled if you mill it with survivor.  &nbsp;  <strong>Crusadia Krawler</strong> and <strong>World Legacy - World Armor</strong> work perfectly with this deck, but they are situational and can brick. So I decided to cut them from the deck. They are still a good option, maybe instead of the block spiders.  &nbsp;  One thing to the <strong>X-Krawler Link-Monsters</strong>:  I prefer playing only one <strong>Qualiark</strong>. Its „good“ effects can nearly never be used and I like to have more space for Extra Deck options.  First turn it’s fine to go into <strong>Synapsis</strong> or <strong>Neurogos</strong>, even if they don’t point down to any Monster Zone. Important is the swarming effect, and all X-Krawler share the same. Usually you won’t be able to special more Extra deck Monsters (Linkuriboh + Synapsis is a „solid“ first turn opening) and your opponent will destroy your X-Krawler anyway.  The rest of the Extra Deck is personal preference, you can play whatever you want. Same for the Side Deck, here I show just some thoughts."

The card itself isn't bad, you can destroy up to two of your opponents cards in either players turn. The problem was, that playing rituals wasn't that consistent and you were out of resources if your board got broken.  With all the support that Rituals got (Pre-prep, Impcantations) it's possible, to get to your Ritual pieces easier. Now the Lord of Red enters the field nearly every turn.  What Ritual decks usually don't use, is the <strong>Extra Deck. </strong>I thought that was a waste of potential. Sure, the <strong>Invoked</strong>-Engine is nothing very innovative, but so we got an easy way to use our Extra Deck, just by normal summoning Aleister the Invoker. With Aleister and the Impcantations we got the Fusion materials for Mechaba and Caliga, Lord of Red and Ash Blossom are perfect for Purgatrio. At some time you may have to decide, whether to normal Aleister or Manju. Both cards can get one engine going on their own, so i wouldnt cut any of these.  Another Extra Deck option is the Super Polymerisation, primary to get rid of your opponents monsters. Superpoly-targets depend on the meta.  Diabolos is a nice tech card. It can be specialed when we tribute the Impcantations for the Ritual summon of Lord of Red. If an Aleister is on field, we can also use Diabolos effect to make our opponent lose one card in his hand.  In the end I got a searchheavy and consistent fun deck, that is nice for going first, as well going second.  Ratios for Impcantations and handtraps can be chanced for personal preferences. For going second BLS is a good option, because the Impcantations are Light and Dark attribute monsters.  Called by the grave secures our searchpower. Even if Aleister or the Impcantations get stopped by a handtrap, Pre-preparation or Rites is a one-card Ritual summon. Pot of Desires should be activated AFTER searching the combo pieces.  Hornet Drones gives us a one-card Link summon of Aleister the Invoker of Madness or another generic Link monster.  &nbsp;  If you got an idea how to make this deck better, please leave it down in the comments.  &nbsp;"

It featured a going 1st deck with different earth-engines to stun the opponent.  I thought about some more cards, that could fit into this deck and ended up on a going 2nd strategie with some changes to the original deckbuild. Ofc this is no competetive deck, but for Rogue matchups it works pretty well. Here is a description of the engins and support cards:  <strong>Rock-Engine:</strong> One good winning condition is the <strong>Block Dragon</strong>, that searches us two lvl-4 rock-monsters to go into <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. As targets i choose 3 <strong>Gigantes</strong> and one <strong>The Rock Spirit</strong>, because they can be specialed easily. <strong>Lapis</strong> is the target for <strong>Brillant Fusion</strong> and for <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong>.  <strong>Insect-Engine:</strong> The main reason for this is <strong>Gokipole</strong>, that can search and special a normal insect monster and remove one Monster from the field without targeting or destroying. To trigger its effect, we got mill cards, i.e. <strong>Resonance Insect</strong>, wich can also search <strong>Kaijus</strong> or <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. So we got one more removal and XYZ/Link-Material.  <strong>Combo Starter/Extender:</strong> <strong>Mathmatician</strong> and <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong> are good normal summons that start our combos. We can enable the Insect-engine by milling <strong>Gokipole</strong>, get extenders like <strong>Dotscaper</strong> or <strong>Glow-up Bulb</strong> into the graveyard or just go into a Rank 4. <strong>Gallis</strong> is a free potential special summon and can mill more combo pieces.  Going-2nd-cards: <strong>Pankratops</strong> and <strong>Kaijus</strong> to remove opponents monsters.  <strong>Spells:</strong> These are combo starter/extender. <strong>Kaiju Slumber</strong> ofc is a removal and search tool and <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> is needed for winning with <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> Can be chanced depending on the opponent or meta. <strong>Curious</strong> is an important combo piece to mill specific cards. <strong>Saryuja</strong> can be used to draw more cards while using weak monsters for the link summon. <strong>Bagooska</strong> is a nice Going-1st card and <strong>Granite</strong> can search our Block Dragon. You can add any Link-4 monster you want, Borrelsword works perfectly in this, but its a bit more expensive."

It's not like you'll lose if you go 1st, but 2nd might be better for this deck.  This deck makes use of some HERO cards that are currently exclusive to the OCG. These cards are Elemental HERO Liquidman, Elemental HERO Sunriser and Xtra HERO Hell Diviser.  Nibiru, the Primal Being can counter opposing decks that Summon a lot during a single turn, but it can also work well as the Rock Fusion Material for Evil HERO Dark Gaia.

There are a few variations on this from the winning decks I've seen. No Black Dragon Collapserpent, or White Dragon Wyverburster. They're cool extra special summons, but while White Dragon is pretty consistent in this deck, its a light attribute which is no good with Allure of Darkness, and Black Dragon was pretty inconsistent. They're just awkward, and I'd rather have more copies of the good Rokkets to tutor for so I can do what I want with my Rokket pile, and take full advantage of both the searching and the card advantage inherent in Rokkets. The deck also makes a considerable number of special summons already. There's still room for a Tempest, and I'm considering going up on White Rose Dragon. But having 3 Rokket Tracer seems pretty important to the core, and 2 of each other gives me good tutoring ability. I'd also be remiss to cut an Absorouter.  In the extra deck, I've opted for Black Rose Dragon to combo with White Rose Dragon, and to give me a good repeatable destroy all. This should also be good enough to clear away backrow. There Borreload Savage Dragon, a good thing to pull out of the extra deck with Agarpain after making lots of link plays. And also there's Ib, because the 2 Draconnet combo can immediately pull her out, and she can pull out World Legacy Guardragon, which is big for making the link plays. Then I have on Borreload Furious Dragon as a Dragon's Mirror target. Its effect is really good with Booster Dragon and Rokkets, and its a freeish extra special summon in a deck that stocks its graveyard so well. Besides that, I have a pretty normal link pile for the deck, with lots of one-ofs since I can recur from the graveyard and from banishment with Guardragons. Shout outs to Link Spider and I:P Masquerana, one of which starts combos super easily, and the other of which lets you continue combos after your Rokkets have tutored on your end step  EDIT*  Running Apollousa for the IP: Masquerana combo. Also added a single Autorokket Dragon, since its a 3 star monster to tutor for, useful for making Black Rose Dragon and Ib. It also gives us an option against spell/trap heavy decks.  Added Skullmeister to the maindeck. It's a dark monster hand trap, so I figured it would be good to try it out. It should help game 1 against Orcust, really gearing decks up to take on Orcust.  Flipped around the hand traps, to move more D.D. Crow and Called to the main and Skullmeister to the side.  EDIT***  Now I'm trying more of the Rokket support, in Striker Dragon, Boot Sector Launch, and Dillingerous Dragon. This gives me a third way to tutor for support off of link monsters, and more combo extenders for Rokket plays.  I've gone down on Called for BSL, so I may still end up cutting it. Even with this many Rokket monsters, I might fall short of BSL in average hands, so as much as another linkable tutor is appealing, I'm reserving judgement.  I've also added one Destrudo; not much to say, its a more reliable special summon than White Rose Dragon, and it gives me an alternative way to combo out of the graveyard that's less backbreaking than Tempest, and you can loop it with Dragon Ravine (half your lifepoints is nothing to sneeze at, but you'll never not be able to pay it!) It also makes Black Rose Dragon better.  I've changed the trap suite in the side deck, and added Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Dark Steel as another big Link-4 boss monster, over Apollousa. Apollousa lock are great, but Darkness Metal is more of everything the deck is doing.  EDIT***  I've got Knightmare Phoenix in the extra deck for Spell/Trap removal. I've got a Link Spider in the sidedeck for when I want to co-link Knightmares instead of the usual plan.  I'm back on Saryuja Skulldread. He's not strictly necessary, or always possible, but as an MTG player I'm very tempted by a better Brainstorm (even if all I'm doing afterward is the usual loopy guardragon thing). Darkness Metal was cooler in theory than in practice. I've also switched maindeck hand traps for D.D. Crow and Skullmeister. Unlike Ash, you can pitch them to Allure, and with so much graveyard interaction in the meta it makes sense to hose graveyards maindeck.  Side Deck is now 3 each of Ash, Lancea, Evenly Matched, Nibiru, plus a single Link Spider, one Solemn Judgement as a catch-all, and one Imperial Order. The last one may seem strange in a spell-heavy deck, but the idea is to bring it out in vs dedicated spell heavy decks, set up on turn one, and then stop your opponent from taking you down.  I've moved Triple Burst Dragon back into the main deck. Between Dragon type, the negate, and the extra couple hundred attack points it seems better than Unicorn (which I never have the cards to proc).  EDIT  Dropped a hand trap for a second Silverrokket. Just more Rokket fuel to pull out of the deck. I found I was occasionally short on level 4 dragons and Rokkets that recur.  I dropped Burial for another Shrine.

It is NOT intended for actual serious play, just as a quick test. You will most likely lose xD. Basically swarm with Dustons using House Duston, Diamond Duston, and The Revenge of the Normal to make Dystopia. Then, if you want, you can tribute Dystopia into Garzett for 10,000 ATK. Also, if you can't get Dystopia, you can use Starduston for loads of ATK, too. But actually, this sucks. Don't use it lol."

It is pretty simple and straight forward but I will go through the key players of the deck just because nothing is stopping me.  <strong>Magic Cylinder</strong>  My all time favourite trap card. Its pretty self-explanatory so I don't want to dwell on this card for long.  an opponent's monster attacks, you activate MC and then boom no damage taken, I can't say the same about your opponent  <strong>Raphion</strong>  Raphion is pretty much the punishment you get for playing high atk monsters and not being able to defend them properly.  Raphion attacks, it activates its effect and your opponent takes all the damage from their monster that Raphion attacked. Savagery  <strong>Amazoness Swords Woman</strong>  She might have low attack stats but never underestimate her at all. Especially when you don't know what she can be capable of.  Amazoness Swords Woman attacks and your opponent takes all the damage you would have taken if you battled against a high attack monster. Good counter for Blue Eyes Max Chaos Dragon  &nbsp;  <strong>Strengths</strong>  This deck is fully utilised in a battle against high attack level monsters with little to no defence in their names.  Blue-Eyes can barely handle a deck like this unless you play Max Chaos, then magic cylinder is useless. But now that Magic Cylinder is out of the picture, B-E Max Chaos has Raphion/Michion to deal with, and that battle will not end well for Blue-Eyes Chaos Max.  Gren Maju deck feels like it was a match made in heaven when playing against this deck, This is because a deck like Gren Maju is an OTK itself depending on one card if not more to handle that OTK task, So why don't we reverse that OTK and use it for ourselves with little to no effort coming only from a <strong>single card!!</strong>  There is this Synchro monster called Pyrocesslayer Final Sigma making the rounds in  the current meta and somehow it has not affected me at all. You know why?. Because it is just another High attack monster. Sure ""unaffected by card effects"" is good but throw in a Dimension Wall+Raphion The Timelord and watch that bad boy crumble  <strong>Weaknesses</strong>  Sure all decks have weaknesses and this deck is also all like the other decks. So don't think you will every single duel with this deck. <ul>  	<li>Well one obvious weakness to this deck is that it is weak against <strong>Stall and Burn</strong> decks because of their lack of high attack monsters</li>  	<li>Effect negating decks are also some painful decks to deal with this deck</li>  	<li>Yes also decks that lockdown spells and traps to being used. Although it is  not that of a big deal. You can still win without playing traps and spells</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>In conclusion</strong>  The deck is pretty fun to play with and teaches your opponent that the people(or duel monsters in this case) that they feed can come back to bite them.  &nbsp;  <strong>P.S</strong>  Although there is Reflect bounder on the side deck. I hardly ever use it because most of my opponent are not that stupid to fall into Reflect Bounder's trap lol.  Feel free to comment and give your input on the deck. There might be some cards that can improve the deck that I am not aware of at the moment. But hey!, everyone had different ideas so help is appreciated."

Key cards in successfully employing the Salamangreat strategy include:  • Gazelle: This is the engine of your Deck. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> dumps the card that is most ideal for perpetuating or achieving a specific game state. More often than not that will be Roar, and in some cases Rage, however, there may be instances where something like Falco (which is being cut entirely now) or Jaguar is more beneficial to send. If you open Rage or Roar, sending something like <a data-name=""Salamangreat Falco"">Salamangreat Falco</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Jack Jaguar"">Salamangreat Jack Jaguar</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Foxy"">Salamangreat Foxy</a>, <a data-name=""Will of the Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a>, or even <a data-name=""Salamangreat Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a> can be a smart decision for enabling future play (though what you send should also be considered with your usage of Stallio as Stallio can Special Summon one of your Salamangreat monsters from Deck).  • Stallio: When you can't get to Gazelle with your opening hand your other option is to Summon Gazelle off of <a data-name=""Salamangreat Mirage Stallio"">Salamangreat Mirage Stallio</a>. This not only makes Stallio vital, for combatting inconsistency, but it makes Stallio incredibly powerful; being able to Special Summon a variety of monsters that serve different roles, at the cost of 2 Level 3s, enables Stallio to jack up the consistency and flexibility of the Deck. Now <em>I cannot stress enough</em> how free Stallio is given its generic Summoning conditions. 2 Level 3s have never been easier to put on board than in 2019, and Salamangreat is no exception to this; the archetype has several ways to spam Level 3s. Given how easy it is to make, and how powerful it can be, it should be of no wonder that Stallio is integral to many of the core combos. For those of you who are learning the archetype, the usual suspect for Stallio's effect is Jaguar as you can use it's graveyard effect to Summon itself under Sunlight Wolf which then triggers the Sunlight Wolf and allows you to recover a Fire monster (like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, Gazelle, Foxy, or even <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>).  • Wolf: Coupled with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a> and your standard combo(s) involving Gazelle sending Roar/Rage, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> offers access to a recyclable omni-negate or pop 2. Its reincarnation Link ability (to recover a Salamangreat back row, once per turn) is one of the cornerstones of the Salamangreat grind game and central strategy. Adding to its relevance is the fact that Wolf can recover your combo pieces. This gives Salamangreat a very zoodiac-esque feel as by recovering Gazelle, you're essentially recovering your entire gameplan. This level of recursion is also definitive of the Salamangreat grind game and is the main reason why Salad is capable of displaying strong turn 2s+.  • Jaguar: Coupled with Sunlight wolf, Salamangreat Jack Jaguar defines the Salamangreat grind game. It can continually recycle your Extra Deck, continually trigger Sunlight Wolf to fetch whatever combo piece you need, and continually provide itself as Link Fodder. As your opponent receives diminishing returns, by way of recursive Roar negates or Rage pops, this card begins to truly shine; offering a free additional summon each turn makes OTKs easier, it makes Rank 4 plays easier, it makes building your board back up easier, and much more.  • Roar / Rage: These are your primary options to consider when using Gazelle's effect. When you're blinding first, it is typically safer to send <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a> as it turns into an infernity barrier-esque negate and can affect a wide range of play styles, but when you know your opponent's strategy (especially if they are playing a back row strategy) it may be smarter to send <a data-name=""Salamangreat Rage"">Salamangreat Rage</a> as it can disrupt their ability to set high levels of disruption. Adding more to their significant disruption is the fact that you can keep setting them each turn with Sunlight Wolf. With each unanswered Sunlight Wolf, these cards push a Salad player closer to winning the game.  Having discussed the core of the strategy, I feel that it is important to highlight cards that accentuate the strategy's end board and consistency. Salamangreat is not a ""break my board"" type of strategy and despite its high resource efficiency, it is not a ""control"" strategy. While it can certainly play as both of these strategies, or facilitate both of these strategies, it is typically played - and will be discussed here - as a mid-range deck.  • Backrow: Impermanence, Solemns, Artifact Engine. I would mandate that Impermanence is necessary as its viability as both a set disruption and hand trap is too strong to ignore for a Deck that lives or dies by a combo that dies to any significant amount of disruption (whether that be going 1st or 2nd). <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> helps you deal with boards going 2nd and 1st; preventing ""break my board"" type decks from outright curb-stomping, and helping disrupt a variety of decks when set going 1st. To a lesser degree, I would recommend looking at the Solemn Brigade and Artifact Engine. <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> at 3 are incredibly strong and can prevent blow-outs from siding or simply add to the low level of turn 1 pressure that Salad naturally applies. <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a> can also help with regards to the latter, but it is far less consistent as you are required to play cards that perform as garnets when opened (<a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>).  • Hand Traps: <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>, Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a>, and even <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> are all worth considering in Salamangreat. While many of these are great options for Salad, it should be noted that when playing specific hand traps - that counter specific meta-strategies as opposed to multiple - you inadvertently hurt the consistency of your gameplan. Salad thrives off being able to be consistent against a variety of Decks, and for that reason your main deck hand traps should only really be used to facilitate consistent disruption. A card like Phantazmay (Thanos Dragon) is great at facilitating this disruption as it can protect your board while drawing into <em>other useful hand traps</em>. Similarly, cards like Ash, Veiler, and Imperm will almost always be consistent disruption. On that note, I would really only advise you to consider these 3 more than any other hand traps; I do not play a high hand trap count because I find that Salamangreat can brick when playing a high number of hand traps, and it can be very hard to play through those bricks (playing something like Phantazmay can in theory work against this, but it also adds to the chance of drawing a weak or dead card - which may or may not be an issue in your eyes).  • Extra Deck: The Salad extra doesn't feature a lot of spice, given how tight it is, but there are some non-Salamangreat cards that should be mentioned. A card like <a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a> is important for Salad matchups and can also be used in the Striker matchup, and given that these 2 decks are very popular in the current meta, this card is a must-have at competitive events. At a less competitive event, however, it is worth noting that you can replace Hiita with something more suitable. An option that can be used in place of Hiita (or simply in place of 2 Stallio) is <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>. Given how easy it is to make a rank 4 in Salamangreat, it is worth considering the rank 4 pool - and Bagooska (turn 1) is incredibly strong when backed up by Salad's grind + disruption. On the note of rank 4s, it is also worth considering <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> (which I consider to be a staple). At this point in the format, it is almost mandatory to play Dweller as it can auto-win a key matchup like Orcust. Aside from these cards, I would also strongly encourage a player to look at <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> into <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> (and when it's released in the TCG, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>). Not much needs to be said about these two as they are some of the strongest board breaking tools available to Salamangreats, that are not Salamangreat."

Running Seal of Orichalchos because why not, an extra 500 points puts my monsters above the 3000 mark, the downside isn't relevant, and I just want to play with the card. Dropped the Skystrikers, because you don't really get the full value off of Engage. Might be correct to play Engage just for deck thinning, but instead I freed up space for Instant Fusion.  Actually (somewhat) using the extra deck now with Extra-Foolish Burial and Instant fusion.  I decided to add back in a single Engage into Hornet Drones. Second copy is dead, but it gives me more deck thinning, potential card draw in theory, and makes tokens for 1000 less lifepoints than the alternative.  Dropped Engage for a One Time Passcode, since 2000 Def is appealing, and this way you don't brick with an Engage and a Hornet Drones when you need both special summons.  Going Terraforming over a second Mystic Mine. Even though it makes me weaker to Ash, it also lets me find Seal in matchups where the power boost is important, and it is functionally that second Mystic Mine still. The deck also isn't very weak to Ash in general, so making my opponent make the hard call on whether to bring hr in game 2-3 is appealing. (Other than finding Mystic Mine or Seal of Orichalcos, the only thing being Ashed is a search for Sauvaris)  I've gone up Preparation of Rites and Solemn Judgement for more protection maindeck. Those last couple slots aren't super important, I think 2 Solemn in place of Extra-Foolish Burial seems reasonable, the deck seems more versatile and this way is actually paying less life points than before."

A variety of the main deck and extra deck Evil Eye monsters gain particularly powerful effects (with some drawbacks) when equipped with Selene. The deck itself plays more of a control deck, using the Evil Eye monsters equipped with Selene to interrupt opponent's plays and deal with problem cards, while the monster equipped with the spell is increasingly difficult to deal with because of Selene's attack boosting effect and granted immunity. The deck itself can main a variety of backrow and tech choices like Super Polymerization, as well as a decent slew of consistency cards (Extravagance, etc.).  Currently the deck feels like ""Guru Control with extra steps"" but I like the extra deck monsters for the deck, as well as the art. So even if it is similar to my current main deck, I'd like to try to make the deck work.  As I have just recently picked up the deck, any suggestions and constructive criticism welcome! Side deck subject to change based on local meta game for the most part."

You want to go first though. Going first you just setup <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>, <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> (which you search off <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>), Dingirsu, <a data-name=""Orcust Crescendo"">Orcust Crescendo</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> which is almost unbreakable. Going second you can just break their board using <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>. I also put in a spicy side deck for going first. Like <a data-name=""Penalty Game"">Penalty Game</a>. This card destroys Sky Striker or any other Spell or Trap focused deck because they won't be able to play. I know a lot of people are playing I:P but I personally don't think it's necessary to win and I don't have the extra deck space. I don't really have much to explain about this deck, mostly everyone should know how to do full Orcust combo at this point since the deck has been around for so long. Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the deck and stick around for more."

Starving venom is in the extra deck because we can easily bring it out with 2 rokkets, and it can win you the game alone.  Crusadia draco helps you put that 4th body on the field. If you are only able to bring out 3 rokkets, no problem! Link summon beat cop, pisty, and special summon Crusadia draco to the free zone that beat cop points to, then use it to summon elpy.  Remember that, in case you need it, you can revive borrelsword or borreload by fusion summoning borreload furious, then destroying it with his own effect, and banishing it from the graveyard."

Low level Igknights can be normal summoned which can be relevant because Red Layer / Renaud + any normal summon Igknight is a full combo (desperate hands). High attack Igknights are also valuable. <ul>  	<li>Igknight gimmick is searching Fire Warrior by popping 2 Igknights in scale. That allows you to search a Red layer which I am sure all know by now is a free warrior drop, they can search NEW card <a data-name=""Flame Noble Knight Renaud"">Flame Noble Knight Renaud</a> which can special summon himself if you control a fire warrior monster (Even got an extradeck target for that) ON top of that.

This cards token producing effect is not HOPT, the most revived card after Armageddon knight</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Glow-Up bulb"">Glow-Up bulb</a> - just the best level 1 for the... Ferret requirement. If bulb gets hit jet synchron replaces that well</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Doppel warrior"">Doppel warrior</a> - just the best level 2 for the Ferret requirement. Its a warrior.. this is a warrior deck good overall.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> - The Apex flying beast, the true alpha of infinite negates.

Weevil received new support that fit his deck/dueling style in the Legendary Duelist Ancient Millennium set last year. I incorporated his new support into his deck. I built his deck to resemble how it played in the anime throughout the different arcs.

As you are going first, the mekk cards used are minimum, like 3 purple, 1 copy each for: blue, indigo, red, and yellow. You can replace some blue or purple for more red/yellow depends on the matchup.

Generally, you want to normal summon red resonator and special summon armageddon knight to send destiny hero malicious to the grave, from here link summon cryston needlefiber, using its effect you want to generally special summon plaguespreader zombie or glow-up bulb depending on other tuners options available. From here utilise malicious and tuner effects to go into scarlight red dragon, hot RDA bane and hot RDA abyss.  Hot RDA abyss is the most important card to get out due to its effect of negating any card on the field for the turn, this is a quick effect. Hot RDA bane has good synergy via its tribute one monster to special summon another RDA from the grave effect, allowing you to further synchro summon. When Bane deals battle damage, it can special summon 2 same level tuners (1 from grave one from deck) and the best options here are red resonator from grave and plague-spreader from the deck. WHen red resonator is special summoned, you can gain life points equal to any monster's atk, Bane has 3500 atk. Following battle phase when these tuners have been special summoned, link summon Apollousa using the 2 tuners and cryston needlefiber to lock down the enemy. Summoning out vanity's fiend also locks the enemy down.  Resonator call is extremely useful in getting red resonators to start combos, or synchron resonators to turn your level 8 synchros into hot RDA Abyss and really control the game.  Lightsworn Wulf is a good addition to the deck as it can be sent to graveyard and special summoned out. If it is caught in the hand you can use plaguespreader zombie's effect to place it on top of deck and then use glow-up bulb for an easy special summon.  The psychics are useful to get into easy combos via emergency teleport and special summoning risebell can help get into a variety of synchro monsters.  Super polymerization clears troublesome dark monsters as most decks use dark monsters. Works very well when using just 2 of the opponents monsters and none of your own however the deck does have dark monsters for its own fusion materials if needed.  This deck is a lot of fun to use, hopefully you enjoy it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Also I switched out artifact lancea for imperial iron wall for going first, but if wished, you can trade them back. Sorry for uploading multiple decks, I just got feedback on what to change. You can change what you want in this deck, but keep the cards at 43. Personally I think 43 cards is too much, you can take out crackdown if you want, and play Compulsory Evacuation Device instead of the two crackdowns, your choice. Both cards are staples and will not hurt the engine if taken out, but leave one of the two in. Control the board. If opponents deck has non-targetable high attack monsters, try bringing out Borrel Sword or moon mirror shield."

Here you can do 2 things: 1 summon crimson nova and boost his atack if he is too weak 2 summon link monsters to break the oponents board  The optimal play is to summon crimson nova on the board but this is not always possible.  He is very weak against spells and traps and if you are not carefull he's going to get removed from play. He is uneffected by monster effect with an ORIGINAL atack of 3000 or lower. So if your oponent his no set spels or traps summon him and atack for game. He can atack twice if the first atack destroys a monster and in the end fase burn 3000 damage. If you dont have enough atack power boost him with cubic wave or an cubic karma. This is the easiest play and the bread and butter of cubics.  Play number 2 is needed when your oponent has an out to crimson nova you usely do this when the opponent plays an control heavy deck or has a lot of traps set. You want to sent 1 unification of the cubic lord to the graveyard. you can do this with duza or an foolish burial goods. When you draw one use one of your knightmare link monsters to send 1 to the grave if needed. If unification is in the grave it can special summon a cubic monster from the deck or hand when a cubic monster LEAVES the field. Leaving the field happens when you tribute summon or link summon. So get 2 monsters on the field at least 1 cubic monster then link summon a generic link2 banish unification special summon duza and send 1 more unification to grave. Then link summon a link 3 monster activated unification in grave and repeat proces. (Unification is not a once per turn effect).  To play around traps play twin twisters and red reboot. Denko Sekka is also an option but this eats up your normal summon and you cant play there can only be one. This deck also really suffers from handtraps so if this is an problem side deck in called by the graves. Further speedburst dragon can do masive damage and that can easily be an otk but it hurts the consisticy.  &nbsp;

Getting out Zombie World is usually a top priority in most cases, it helps to set up the plays of many of your cards such as Doomking Balerdroch or Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon by making all cards on field and in grave zombie type. This type change is also one of the most powerful parts of the deck due to its counter potential. Decks reliant on their cards being of a certain type such as Thunder Dragon, Dino variants, Cyber Dragon are turned off. Link monster that require a certain type of monster such as Salamangreat Baleynx, Guardragons, or Xtra HERO Cross Crusader are unable to be summoned. True Draco decks are unable to summon monsters under zombie world due to not being able to tribute summon anything except zombie monsters.  The deck does have it's weaknesses, being ash blossomed to prevent grave yard set up or cards like D.D. Crow, Masked HERO Darklaw, or anything else that can banish your cards from grave or stop them from going to grave can stop a lot of plays. Decks like Orcust, Alterguist, and Pendulum as well often don't care about having their types changed making Zombie World not flood gate them.  So why play the deck? For Doomking. A card that can summon itself from grave during every standby phase, can negate any monster effect from field or grave, and has non targeting banishing removal of anything on the field or the grave. Once out he is your beat stick, you negation tool, your link fodder.  Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon can become a massive beat stick based on the number of cards on field or in grave that besides Doomking is very hard to out, and even comes with his own effect to steal your opponents monsters after destroying them by any mean.  The Utopia combo is easily usable with a quick use of Uni-Zombie and a draw of Danger Jackalope or Danger Noodle and can help to deal easy game winning damage.  With Zombie World and Dragonercro Nethersoul Dragon super poly can be the answer to any board there is.  &nbsp;"

The best bet for the deck is to bait out negations or things like Ash Blossom by using spells in hand you don't need at the moment (such as E - Emergency call if you already have Stratos). Being able to get out the Evil Hero plays allows for an easy board wipe as well as good damage due to Malicious Bane's effect.  Part of the side deck is for both match up and budget if you are buying the actual deck. Replacing the evil hero cards with an extra E call and Super Poly is good if the opponents monsters are immune to destruction effects.  &nbsp;

With the introduction of all the moving monsters and magical musketeers specifically, it seemed like it was right around the corner. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I ended up splashing the mekk's in other decks and then my boy Shannon Long decided to go crazy and make it extremely popular. With that being said I did take a few notes from him, but I did not net deck him. I made a few significant deck changes, and just kept sorta the same style of play. So let me show you the things. Please leave comments if you liked it.  First I play 3 good normal summons. Avram is a searchable normal off of purple, and capshell is just used to be linked off. When he is he lets you draw a card. I decided to play this over ipiria because I feel like its harder to handtrap but only slightly.  I play the field spell at one because I do play 9 different mekk-knights. Most of the time though you use the other effects.  I swapped up the extra deck a bit. Since you don't play the whispers I play the titanic to stop a few spells from Going through. I play the exa beetle because he makes a free column. You probably won't make him often since the only level 6's are Green and the World Crown. Lastly, I play the one Kagari and the Hornet drones because the hornet drones is also a one card column.  The primary goal of the strategy is to set a bunch of mekk-knights on the field with a whispers down to prevent monster effects from going through. Morning star can search secret if you discard another world legacy or mekk-knight monster. Purple can search the indigo for you, and you can special him without a column if you use memory.

People seem to not realize that mathmech have 0 Turn 1 plays a,"A note to those who want to play this deck, avoid playing a bunch of the cards you typically see in mathmech decks (like the spells, traps, &amp; XYZs). Mathmech have 0 Go First plays and you need to maximize your ability to OTK.  &nbsp;  Make use of Phantazmay to shape up your hand and give yourself a body. Use Pankratops as spot removal to pop anything like There Can Only Be One which is a huge hinderance to this whole strategy. Gameceil is a necessity for this OTK because it makes sure that you won't have to endure annoying monster reliant infernity barriers or annoying quick effect monsters. Hey, Trunade! Gets rid of all the set cards or forces out Judgement. Called by the grave handles the Ash Blossom that can cripple the entire OTK combo. Don't worry about Nibiru, making 6k Final Sigma that can attack twice can be made by 4 summons so you should never be Nibiru'd.  &nbsp;  You want to Normal Summon Nabla (this NEEDS to be your Normal summon) and use Sigma, Addition, or Subtraction as a free body to use as tribute fodder for Nabla. Nabla will special Multiplication from deck where it can then target itself or Nabla. Synchro into Final Sigma and now you can make Final Sigma 6k and attack twice (If your opponent has Called by the Grave they can stop Multiplication). You can then OTK and there's nothing your opponent can do to stop it. Hydrate yourself on their salty tears :)"

The deck surrounds it's an entire strategy around Crystron Needlefiber(or habquilifax if you want to go by it's TCG name). the reason why needle fiber is in the deck is that it is, in my opinion, the best engine to give kuribohs the boost that they need without going into any chaos shinanigans. the new card Generation Next is also a VERY good extender for kuribohs because one it allows the deck to extend more if you are picking up what I'm putting down. all jokes aside though, the card is really good and is a very easy substitute for Mimiclay which is a card that I was using in my previous build. anyway, the deck was really fun to build and I really enjoyed playing it.

Well look no further let me introduce y,"Combos &amp; Deck up against meta &gt; <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E"">https://youtu.be/KGPXActzw-E</a>      <strong>Card ratio explanations below </strong> <ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The deck has 30 Igknights, Open 3 and you have a full combo (showed in a video, prior to Renaud 3 Igknights did nothing you needed 4), Igknights offer resiliancy, follow up play and high consistency. Due to Pendulum mechanic, Even cards like Malicious are good draws with Igknights</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">9 Normal summons: Connector = ftk, vyon = ftk, Summoner monk is a combo piece but since he can net you vyon pseudo ftk starter, ROTA = FTK, Rabbit + any Igknight = ftk (there are probably more rabbit combinations)). Armageddon knight by itself is not an ftk wierdly enough. Isolde</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">In a nutshell if you can make Isolde you got an FTK and its SUPER DUPER JUPER EASY TO MAKE ISOLDE EASIER THEN EVER</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Half an Isolde (all super searchable) - Renaud, Red Layer, Gearfried (granted he is a boss monster primarly)</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Cards which Arma sends - Zephyros, Summoner monk, Destrudo, Malicious, PK boots. All can be pend summoned (apart from destrudo). Average dark warrior / Isolde turbo decklists desperately tries to loop arma knight. THIS DECK does it with ease, in average you are summoning Isolde without normal summon so you can literally bounce back ARMA with zepyhros and then normal summon him (Heck often times you don't evne have to NS him you can pend him). I even debated not needing Power Tool and so many D.D.Rs, but those cards make the deck more resiliant to disruption so eh.</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">1 Rank up spell (doesn't matter which sadly, we found a brick oh no... Zexal is worth it)</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">7 Equips including 3 d.d.r for powertool and 4 equips for Isolde (No need for more Powertool arma loop is often times not needed). Axe of fools can bait cards and then be re-added back with renaud to bait more stuff (often times you have to drop renaud early so relevant). D.D.R gets reused often due to renaud / zephyros / power tool, Moon mirror is there to keep an equip count steady**, Phoenix blade Enables summoner monk (often twice), d.d.r (often twice), Gearfried, Knightmare Gryphon (Core combo), Knightmare phoenix, Knightmare Unicorn, aqua dolphin (rare), zephyros (rare)**</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rescue Ferret normaly summons L3 Igknight + PK boots / 2 level 4 Igknights. I am not running combo bricks for Ferret in this build (got an infinite negate igknight video in which i run bulb doppel steam the cloak for him)</p> </li>  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Rebarian shark. Revives the dugares, stack the Rank - up, draw it with Gryphon &gt; UTOPIC ZEXAL.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Boots + Brigadine is in the deck because it allows arma loop to turn into a R4, also for Ferret. The main combo summons 2 R4 (Dugares the timeless, classic utopia for zexal) so its relevant. Brigadine is classically good Isolde father, boots can be pend summoned, normal summoned... since the main Pendulum warrior into Isolde way doesn't NS)</p>  <ul class=""_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"">  	<li class=""_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz""> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Selene endymion link revives the summoner monk.

No worry, pure Striker can still draw with Bamboos while having the advantage of consistent 1st turn board Apollousa+backr","Another Sky Striker build (pure-ish) using Bamboo Swords as draw power. If Engage got hit on f/l list, then you can replace it with more bamboos. If it doesnt get limited/banned, well, enjoy having Apollousa+backrows+billions cards in hand AND otk next turn using Gearfried+Borrelsword.  We use Isolde to summon Apollousa. I will explain the Isolde combo using Ex-Paladin (fire warrior). Before normal summoning Ex-Paladin, it's preferable to resolve your Sky Striker Hornet Drones first. Normal summon Ex-Paladin, activate, equip Tune Knight (from deck/hand), ss Tune Knight (dont use its effect), ss Isolde, add God Phoenix Gearfried, send Cursed Bamboo, ss Flame Noble Knight Renaud, activate Renaud chain Cursed Bamboo, add Golden Bamboo from deck and Cursed Bamboo from GY. To summon Apollousa, we need one more extender, thats why we're playing cards like Hornet and Roze (sky striker extenders), 2-3 Renaud (1 summon from isolde, the rest is extender), One for One, RotA, Monster Reborn, Living Fossil (equip for Isolde requirement, extender), and Area Zero (extender if destroyed).  The rest are just Sky Striker cards, Bamboos (2 Cursed, 2-3 Golden, 1 Bamboo Sword), and the backrow lineup (I used Trap Trick+Threatening Roar to prevent getting otk'd, another reason is cus most generic big link monsters like borreload, borrelsword, bls, and avramax are online while atking, so we use Threatening Roar to stun them and force them to play grind game cus we play striker anyway or we can otk them next turn).  Extra Deck: 1-2 Borrelsword, 1-2 Apollousa, 2 Isolde, Sky Strikers, and Linkuriboh (from double Renaud for summoning Apollousa and from Hornet token for summoning Borrelsword). The rest are just generics.  PS: I dont use Multirole cus we can otk with Borrelsword, can be used just in case it got grindy. The Threatening Roar package can be replaced with any good backrows too."

I was already using the Utopia play with it, but using mystic mine and sitting on sera or even tributing your board with Frozen Rose, just to OTK your next turn is brilliant. Mystic Mine with with Demise of land can save this deck in so many situations and is too good not to take advantage of (despite the hate) IMO.  <strong>Ok, why Sky Striker?</strong>  Red Reboot beats this deck. Mystic mine and demise of land help work around that, but I found the deck could still use more draw power (or any for that matter) and more quick play spells for support. After tinkering, Sky Striker seems to be the solution.  Using Engage to add and set a live Widow, and sometimes drawing a card after, is insane, and the consistency of adding a solid negate turn one provides the deck with much needed support in the harshest of Red Reboot times.  Another issue with pure Traptrix decks is the lack of Traptrix monsters. The Sky Striker cards facilitate that void by creating semi tough monsters through hornet drones, which can be searched via Engage, and then function similarly first turn as Traptrix Sera, making the back row support always effective.  <strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton?</strong>  This card just make the OTK that much more possible, and allows you to make those XYZ plays while sometimes simultaneously outing their Avramax, Fantasmay, or W/E. You can even use this card to lock your opponent out of the Extra Monster Zone entirely, <em>Pretty Sweet. </em>  <strong>Insta Fusion is the Spice.</strong>  Insta Fusion for me is either another lvl 4 monster that wont get destroyed or a nice relinquish that helps me out second turn. This card is really good, and is too free RN not to use."

This is done by getting treasure panda to get them on the field and using wonder wand and white elephant's gift. Then you use backup soldier to get the pieces out of the grave. This sometimes takes a couple turns so there are many search cards and hand resets in here to increase chances.

A good budget deck with some nice techs.,"My new Tenyi Deck, post Ignition Assault. It's mostly a going first deck, but it's something between combo and control. You wanna bring either the Draco Master +  Berserker of the Tenyi or Monk + Draco Berserker on the field. Skilldrain is an awesome card, because you don't need most of your effects on the field, because the Tenyi trigger in the GY or hand. The Blue Eyes Ultimate is just for Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Waterfall of the Dragons, is your best draw card. Just throw up on of your Tenyi and draw 2 cards. Lost wind  is just one of my favourite current cards. It's awesome for going first, and very often saves your ass.  &nbsp;  Avramax and Unicorn are actually cards I use very rarely. They can probably go out for something different. They were just inside because of the scapegoat combo, wich comes also very rarely in this deck. Maybe a Borreload Savage Dragon would be an good option, but he's to expensive for me. By the way, this deck is very cheap."

Once you have 5 you can drop it and Kill 2 card out of your opponents hand. If mermail atlantean deck ever becomes meta this card ll be the first on a banlist radar. Searchable of Dragoons</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Gameciel Kaiju"">Gameciel Kaiju</a> - Going second water Kaiju,  great because your monsters have to discard waters also due to mooray of greed, can be re added back to hand</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssMegalo"">Mermail AbyssMegalo</a> - better then ever, him + neptabyss is a massive combo and prior to deep seas you needed more waters for such hand to be good. This card is really huge for the <strong>side deck</strong>, as he is abyss scale searcher and each scale is situationally great depending on the matchup</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssTeus"">Mermail AbyssTeus</a> - Superb card, searches typically gunde, triggers all your stuff by summoning himself. No complaints</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssPyke"">Mermail AbyssPyke</a> - Primadona (new lvl 7 deep sea synchro) Summons this boi so more cruical then ever.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mermail AbyssGunde"">Mermail AbyssGunde</a> - if this discarded (which even deep sea Minstrel can nowdays do you can revive another mermail)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lappis Dragon"">Lappis Dragon</a> - If searched by Dragoons or drawn of Coral Dragon, Desires, Mooray you can ss him. He is level 5 water turn which can be brought back with Marincess link to. Synchro him into Primadonna by reviving the level 2 Deep Sea Sentry.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Atlantean Dragoons"">Atlantean Dragoons</a> - superb card, not once per turn and with Deep sea sentry adding it back you can keep discarding it and re using it.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Atlantean Marskman"">Atlantean Marskman</a> - Just 1 this card is hyper searchable. Abyss Teus searches it through Abyss Pyke, super searchable neptabyss does to..</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Atlantean heavy infantry"">Atlantean heavy infantry</a> - Going second card pops face up cards when discarded for water monsters effect. This includes mermail link so you can abuse this during opponents turn. Also additional normal summon can matter even for deep seas</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Neptabyss, the atlantean prince"">Neptabyss, the atlantean prince</a> - prince needs no introduction</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Deep Sea Minstrel&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Deep Sea Minstrel</strong> </a>- 1 IS ALL YOU NEED.

Anti handtrap deep sea monster</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deep Sea Sentry""><strong>Deep Sea Sentry</strong></a>- my favorite - as that way Dragoons gains another worthy discard target while prior to that he only had neptabyss. (neptabyss when discarded revives kinda relevant). Handloops, also correct level with Lappis Dragon for new synchro</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a> - limited to 1 and tbh neptabyss is more resiliant normal summon anyway. as long as this card ain't banned it doesn't truly matter the number she is at</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fishborg Launcher"">Fishborg Launcher</a> - LL get better as the time goes on.

The deck loses to new storm / raigeki so why not. The other abyss-scales are good to, they should all be in between your main and side deck, the one you main is format dependent.

Magician's rod is the searcher to get the pieces needed for dark magician depending on what you already have.  Inspector border is there cause you want your opponent to use as little monster effects as possible. He may take up a normal summon but its a fair cost for a good effect.  Dark magical circle is for setting up the draw phases but you usually want to use that card last. Use the banish part of the effect to get rid of stuff on your opponent's field.  Secret village is great at stopping the opponent from playing assuming they don't have any spellcasters otherwise it's better to side out. Side note is make sure you can always have a spellcaster out there otherwise you will screw yourself  Card of demise, starting turn you want to set everything and use it. If you have inspector border then summon or magician rod summon and add illusion magic. Drawing 3 cards for free is ridiculous. And I've found playing magician with floodgates is the best way to go. And you want to make sure at min you are discarding 2 DM during your end phase.  Pot of duality is to try to get cards you already haven't used or to get cards needed for later.  Spellbook engine is a good engine, just more draw power to mill through the deck.  Illusion magic is meant to be used after you use card of demise so you can add two magician to discard and have your graveyard set up.  Dark magic expanded is honestly there to use the second effect and it's good. To protect your stuff from being destroyed is great.  Eye of timueas is great to bring out the extra deck magician for the situation. Dragon knight is great at protection and having another magician in the field/gravyard. Amulet dragon is for decks that recycle spell and trap cards from the graveyard so you can flat out banish them. Dark paladin is for dragon decks, that negating a spell card is always fun. Dark calvary is for more or less like amulet but if your opponent has a defense position monster its as good as game.  Foolish burial is to get a DM in the graveyard as soon as possible bit if all  Summoner art is if you haven't seen rod but need dark magician quick(can be replaced with upstart goblin)  Dark inheritance in to add whatever magician card you're missing.  Summon limit, no way your going to summon more than that except on really rare times.  Skill drain, stop those effects.  Solemn strike is to stop hand traps, monsters activating an effect or special summons.  Judgement the best no card  Eternal soul is the best card in the deck in my opimion, always special summoning a DM and they can't destroy it other than battle (or destoying the card) you have to protect the card at all costs  No much to say about the extra deck other than link spider is there if you have to make one dark magician work. And beat cop is to protect eternal soul once.  This deck's weaknesses are called by the grave(banish dark magician), evenly match, mst, unaffected by card effect monster/ can't be targeted, and monster stronger than 2500. You can still do stuff just makes it harder."

Not recommended to new players.  After a large amount of testing, I've managed to start optimizing the deck;  The first turn plan is more consistent with higher access to <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> than before; swapping to a Trinity on <a data-name=""Impcantation Pencilplume"">Impcantation Pencilplume</a> allows for a higher chance of getting to <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> (through Candle), while also providing the deck with an additional option for recursion in the lategame. In addition, the extra Plume allows us to perform the ""Altar OTK"", by Using <a data-name=""Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator"">Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator</a> to Summon 2 Pencils and 1 Candle, and then itself, for 9000 damage.  I played most of the more recent tournament without <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>, and regretted it massively, siding both in every game. The option to go into rank 4s with Unicore and either Manju or a Candle (negated with Forbidden Chalice) was too important - that's not even mentioning how crucual sending n'tiss and herald is. I moved <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> to the sidedeck, since he was only really used as a defensive measure, which imps do well enough by themselves.  The set of 5 Monarch S/T to 3 monarchs means that <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> and <a data-name=""Pantheism of the Monarchs"">Pantheism of the Monarchs</a> are rarely dead (Ehther will almost always have something to summon - either kuraz into a pop 2, or Caius into a <a data-name=""Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand"">Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand</a>), and the Pantheism you send will then be able to search 1 of your 3 remaining ""Monarch"" S/Ts.  New side includes a <a data-name=""Demise, King of Armageddon"">Demise, King of Armageddon</a> package; it lets us play the free +1 that is Pre-Preparation of Rites, and works wonders against board-spam decks.  I REALLY want to play <a data-name=""Trial and Tribulation"">Trial and Tribulation</a>, but can't find the space for it. I might cut MST for it."

The only thing to keep in mind is your ""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"" for its effects in both the field and the graveyard by summoning ""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"". I think you know where I'm going with this(wink wink)."

Check. Orcusts hit on the banlist? Check. Still rokking? Check. With the new Borrelend Dragon, this combo deck will have mega ridicul","Both Dragon Link and Orcust deck have similarity, like both are dark and even in your brickest hand, you can still push through while restricted to only can summon dark monsters because of Rokket Synchron, Tracer, and the Orcusts. Both have great GY interaction too. Rip TCG Harp Horror, now it's hard to splash orcust, i'm putting this in non-meta catergory.  Combo is simple but needs practice cus it has multiple ways to establish the board with different combination of extenders (esp when you have to play through handtraps), I will explain the most common 2 routes. Before starting, you have to manage your hand first, like the draw cards (should you use it first/not). Essentially, any draw cards should be used later after you are finished searching/ss your combo pieces so you can maximize your card advantage.  First route, you have to summon Romulus, add Ravine, dump cards from hand (Orcust) and deck (dragon), then manage your way to the Guardragon/s (Pisty isn't necessary, but it's a nice extender), then summon Borrelend using the Guardragons so you can continue to Orcust, and do the Orcust basic combo (not I:P, but the Galatea+Ding+Crescendo or Galatea+Babel+GY Ding and Cymbal). Extenders like GY Absorouter+Synchron and Destrudo (ss targetting cymbal, synchro with baby chaos dragons, Gateway, Grepher, or Harp) can be used to make Borreload Savage.  Second route is the harder route like if you open bad or have to play through handtraps. This route you have to go to Beat Cop/Dillingerous to do regular Dragon Link combo or just pure regular Orcust.  Cards played at 3 copies cus you wanna see it the most, while the 2 copies are either cus banlist and you wanna see it often but is hopt or dont wanna open doubles, one copy cus banlist or searchable.  The Dragon Links: 2 Absorouter (1 fo dump, 1 for extender), 1 Destrudo (tuner, extender), 3 Seyfert (main opener, searching, preferrably Collapserpent), Collapserpent and Wyverbuster (great dragon extenders), 1 or 2 Gateway Dragon (extender, great for going second), 2 Tracer and 2 Synchron (extender++ but locking to dark extra deck), 1 Boot Sector Launch (extender, great going second), and lastly, 3 Quick Launch (extender, not hopt).  The Orcusts: 2 Wand, 3 Knightmare,  1 Girsu, 1-2 Cymbal, 1 Brass (tuner, One for One target), 2 Return, 1 Babel, 1 Crescendo.  The Dumpers (what tie the deck together): Dark Grepher (extender using Absorouter, Destrudo, Wand, or Orcust Knightmare), Brotaur (searcher while dumping Orcust on hand, searchable with Elpy or One for One), Allure of Darkness (draw, banished orcust card can be summoned with Wand or recycled with Galatea), One for One (extender while dumping Orcust in hand), Foolish Burial, Dragon Shrine (dump dragon), Ravine (dump both dragon and Orcust).  Extra Deck: Combo pieces/end board targets. Some cards like Savage, Unicorn, Beat Cop, and Dillingerous can be replaced.  Side Deck: Matchup specific.  Cards to think of: Armageddon Knight (dumper but relies on normal summon), Curious (dumper but hard to make if restricted to dark or dragon), Cyberse Quantum (great lv7 dark synchro but not a dragon, you can switch it with Savage), Silverokket (or other rokkets with nice utility effect, cant act as extender except from Quick Launch or Boot Sector Launch), ...  TESTING  Expected 1st turn: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/hIV8JGK.png"">https://i.imgur.com/hIV8JGK.png</a>  Going second: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/iDT5N1s.png"">https://i.imgur.com/iDT5N1s.png</a> Negated once with opponent's Borrelend.  Pros: Can play through single target disruptions/handtraps. Big monsters, multiple negations, and protections first turn board. Otk easily going second and able to play grindy game using Orcust or Rokket Synchron.  Cons: Super Poly and Ra Sphere Mode food. Need extra thinking to play against wide/global effects like Nibiru, Dimension Shifter, Topologics, etc. Bad hand can end on mediocre board (see 2nd pic opponent)."

A ""brief"" description of the card line-up;  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <strong>Infernoid Onuncu x2: </strong>Dark Hole and backrow negate, two to keep Imagination as a useful card after sending one with Decatron. <strong>Infernoid Devyaty x2: </strong>Heavy Storm and monster negate, same logic as Onuncu. <strong>Infernoid Seitsemas x1: </strong>Very good removal effect on battle phase, summonable with one Decatron using Feast, and quick effect DD Crow. <strong>Infernoid Sjette x1: </strong>Not as good as Seitsemas, but can be summoned with two Decatrons using Feast, and also quick effect DD Crow. <strong>Infernoid Patrulea x1: </strong>Spell destruction, and DD Crow on the opponent's turn. Can be sided out for another Harmadik against monster-heavy decks. <strong>Infernoid Harmadik x1: </strong>Monster destruction, and DD Crow on the opponent's turn. Can be sided out for another Patrulea against backrow-heavy decks. <strong>Infernoid Decatron x3: </strong>Can be any Infernoid, easily searchable with Feast, can be linked off into Almiraj after Normal summoning. All around good boy.  <strong>Subterror Behemoth Umastryx x1: </strong>Being able to flip to banish is great, and easily doable on the opponent's turn with Final Battle. <strong>Subterror Guru x3: </strong>Flips to search the whole archetype, quick effect book of moon while you control another Subterror <em>card, </em>he plays nice with everything. Can also be used to turn Tierra face-down after summon to bring out a big Infernoid from grave. <strong>Subterror Nemesis Archer x1: </strong>Phenomenal field removal, being able to shuffle cards back into the deck, and also floats into any Subterror monster. <strong>Subterror Fiendess x3: </strong>A handtrap negate at the ""cost"" of turning a Subterror monster face-down. Easily recyclable from grave. Also brings out Subterrors from grave as a last-ditch rescue move if necessary.  <span><strong>Spells:</strong></span>  <strong>The Hidden City x3: </strong>Searching, a free flip, and attack prevention that works wonders with Guru's search or Umastryx's banish. <strong>Void Vanishment x3: </strong>Search either Feast or Imagination depending on the need, at a negligible cost, and then destroy it for Feast's cost. Its second effect also occasionally comes up. It just needs to be played after Subterror combos. <strong>Void Imagination x2: </strong>Resolving this is often game, especially if Guru/City are already on the field. Mill six of choice from deck is beautiful, and then destroy 3 opponent's cards with Elder Entity N'tiss. <strong>Terraforming x1: </strong>More Hidden City. <strong>Reasoning x1: </strong>A free summon, where excavating doesn't hurt this deck. <strong>Subterror Cave Clash: </strong>Makes Guru's Book of Moon effect a quick effect, and gives you free recycling of Subterror cards (usually Fiendess). <strong>Pot of Duality: </strong>A blessing going first, saves bricky hands in a deck that doesn't often need its special summon on turn one.  <span><strong>Traps:</strong></span>  <strong>Subterror Final Battle x2: </strong>Searchable trap that resets itself after use to either buff your monsters, prevent negation, or flip either up or down. <strong>Void Feast x1: </strong>As long as you've got another Void card, it's two free negates and a DD Crow on field if this is able to resolve. It helps that the searcher is a continuous spell Void card. <strong>Lost Wind x2: </strong>Permanent negate and attack half that recurs from the grave, even if milled by Reasoning. <strong>There Can Be Only One: </strong>Sometimes hurts Infernoids, but doesn't prevent Void Feast from resolving, allowing you to fill your grave with up to 5 Infernoids, and doesn't bother Subterrors at all.  <span><strong>Extra Deck: </strong></span>  <strong>Elder Entity N'tiss x3: </strong>Just to send to GY with Tierra to destroy opponent's cards. <strong>Infernoid Tierra x3: </strong>Big boss that sends cards to GY, running 3 means you can send extra Tierras if you don't need to send 3 N'tiss. <strong>Borreload Dragon x1: </strong>Bigger boy <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos x1: </strong>Big boy, it's also surprisingly easy to summon this boy in a longer game with Decatron after sending almost any Infernoid. <strong>Knightmare Phoenix: </strong>Emergency backrow removal <strong>Knightmare Cerberus: </strong>Emergency monster removal <strong>Linkuriboh:</strong> To link away negated Decatrons or Fiendess in a pinch <strong>Salamangreat Almiraj: </strong>To link away normal-summoned Decatrons that are in danger staying on the field. <strong>Predaplant Triphyoverutum: </strong>Amazing Super Poly target if your opponent gets three monsters on board, plus isn't blocked by TCBOO. <strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: </strong>The more relevant Super Poly target."

Narrowly dodging effects and attacks, pulling fast ones on your opponent, swiping some of their best cards and resources, plenty to go over. This deck features predominantly Time Thief Main Deck monsters while revolving heavily around that one special Time Thief Xyz, along with his fellow counterpart that brings a whole new layer of utility. In this summary, I'll be going over each of the main components of the deck, monsters, backrow, and extra monsters, and how each correlates to the other in one fashion or another. <h3>Main Deck Monsters</h3> The one monster in your deck to perfectly get things started is <a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a>. If he's the only monster you control, you get to Tribute it and Special Summon two more Time Thief monsters with different names from your deck in defense in its place. This is perfect for setting up your very first Xyz right off the bat, as well as search for powerful resources, which I'll get to in just a bit.  Your primary target for the aforementioned Regulator is <a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a>. Upon Normal or Special Summon, he allows you to search your deck for any Time Thief card, other than itself. This way, you can easily amass resources for the future, either other useful Time Thieves that buff up your Xyz monsters or for the essential backrow of the deck. Alternatively, you could bring him to the field at no Normal Summon cost using his hand effect, which simply has you detach a material from an Xyz you control.  Another primary monster and target for Regulator includes <a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a>. While face-up on the field, it has a Quick Effect to tribute itself and attach any card from your opponent's GY to a Time Thief Xyz you control as material. This is perfect for getting materials and effects off in a flash, not to mention leading to its GY effect, which allows you to Special Summon it back simply by detaching a material from an Xyz you control, much like Winder. Do bear in mind that if it Tributes itself again after this or is used for a Link Summon, it will become banished immediately after, so the best way to recycle it is for material of another Xyz Summon.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Time Thief Time Recorder"">Time Thief Time Recorder</a> may seem like an arbitrary addition to the Main Deck, but if you read into it, there's more than meets the eye. Its own Quick Effect lets it Tribute itself during your opponent's turn to make sure they take the next battle damage, not you. This is ideal for when your opponent has a big, scary high ATK monster that's about to attack directly or hit you for some seriously big points. Just keep in mind that your opponent could potentially attack with a weaker monster first so they take less damage and then attack directly or towards another weak monster using their own big bad tool. Recorder also revives itself in the grave if a Time Thief leaves the field by a card effect, including their own, making it another good choice for future Xyz material or getting its effect off again in dire situations.  The two Danger! monsters in the deck that are primarily used for additional Xyz fodder are <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a> and <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>. Being easy to summon even after using up your Normal Summon, they can also allow you to draw additional cards or send grave-centric materials to the GY, such as Recorder, Bezel Ship, Startup or Flyback. You could also use them as the discard cost for <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, which comes in handy if you need juuuuuuuuuust a little more quick backrow protection.  <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> excels as both a Level 4 DARK monster to Xyz with, as well as a way to bring out more Level 4's like Winder and Bezel Ship by discarding an unwanted Spell for the turn like a Double or Nothing! that was in your regular draw or opening hand. Not much else to say, just surprisingly useful given the archetype of deck it's in. <h3>Spells/Traps</h3> <a data-name=""Time Thief Startup"">Time Thief Startup</a> is a new Quick-Play Spell that allows you to instantly Special Summon any Time Thief from your hand, letting you get off Regulator and Winder's effects off perfectly. You could also use them after your regular Xyz material monsters have been used to bring out Bezel Ship or Recorder to bolster their longevity. Arguably its better effect is in the grave, where you get to banish it and target one of each Time Thief card type from your grave (Monster, Spell, and Trap) to a Time Thief Xyz you control as material. Absolutely perfect for recycling materials and getting your Xyz effects off.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Hack"">Time Thief Hack</a> not only protects your Time Thief Xyz monsters upon summon for the turn, but also powers up said monsters for every material attached to them using its targeting effect. Even better, if the Time Thief targeted with it has a material owned by your opponent (which, given Redoer and Bezel Ship is almost always a guarantee), they get to attack directly and breach all your opponent's best tools. And even if it gets sent to the grave, Startup will make sure it doesn't go to waste.  <a data-name=""Time Thief Flyback"">Time Thief Flyback</a> has two great uses in one, the primary being attaching a Time Thief card from your deck to an Xyz you control as material, typically another Flyback or even a monster or spell to get the banishing or drawing effects off. What you'll likely be mainly using it for, however, is by banishing it from the grave, even during your opponent's turn, to enact a Bezel Ship-like effect and attach any card from your opponent's grave to an Xyz. Even if your opponent destroys it while it's set, they're not safe from its grave effect for the turn.  No Time Thief deck is complete without the ever-essential <a data-name=""Time Thief Retrograde"">Time Thief Retrograde</a>, the brand-new Counter Trap. Simply by having a Time Thief Xyz on the field, you can negate an opponent's Spell/Trap and attach that card to said monster you control. That way, your opponent's only fueling Redoer's wrath and potential to make them pay for thoughtless and strong plays.  Aside from the main Time Thief backrow, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> is used as a quick, easy way to bring out Xyz material in the form of <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>. Not only is it Level 4 and therefore great for bringing out your Xyz monsters, but its Quick Effect can protect your DARK monsters for the turn as well. <p class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> is another amazing material for bringing out Redoer, being a free summon on your first turn and acting as a Trap when attached, letting you get the Monster and Trap detachment effects of Redoer off in tandem right from the get-go.</p> <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> is used as a good, inexpensive way of warding off your opponent's powerful Special Summoned monsters, being able to recycle itself once from the grave when your opponent brings out an Extra Monster. This way, you're essentially playing four in the deck, but you're more than welcome to add in an extra and play six, essentially.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> is a card whose most common targets will include either Bezel Ship or Recorder, given their grave effects. You could potentially swap this or other cards out for <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>, for either Startup or Flyback's respective grave effects, if you're feeling eager. <h3>Extra Deck</h3> The undisputed boss monster of the deck is none other than <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a> himself. He ties the whole deck together, being able to swipe your opponent's cards every Standby Phase and use them to his advantage like it's nothing. Its Quick Effect can do all sorts of crazy stuff when your opponent least expects it. By detaching a Monster, it banishes itself until the End Phase of the current turn. This makes it perfect for escaping powerful attacks and then following up with Recorder to reflect potential damage, or dodging and negating targeting or destruction effects like Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence, and the like. Keep in mind that if it has a backrow card attached as well when activating this effect, it's best to detach them too to get multiple useful effects off at once. Detaching a Spell lets you draw a card, not much else to say. But its other devastating effect comes with detaching a Trap, which lets you return any face-up card your opponent controls back to the top of their deck in a jiffy, punishing them for either heavy attacks or devastating effects they thought would be wise to get off with Redoer on the field. Even better, if used on your opponent's turn, next turn you get to attach that same card you returned atop the main deck to Redoer as material, to add further insult to injury. I can't tell you how many times I'd duped people with this particular effect, it's insane.  The other essential Extra Deck monster is <a data-name=""Time Thief Perpetua"">Time Thief Perpetua</a>, commanding two amazing effects in one. By detaching a material from her, you get to revive any Time Thief from your grave, including the main deck monsters or Redoer. It's ideal to use when Redoer's been used for the material of a Link Summon or the like, mainly for <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a> or <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>. Its Quick Effect also allows you to attach a Time Thief card from your deck to Redoer for absolutely free, letting you get more effects off faster. It's an amazing support card for the deck, and I sincerely hope and pray it comes stateside real soon.  The Utopia Engine is great to use already, given the deck's emphasis on Xyz monsters. <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> acts as an easy way to bring out far more powerful monsters while you have barely any other options, namely <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a> for attack negation or massive <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a> -boosted attacks, or <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> for wonderful 5000 ATK destruction without fear of your opponent's cards being activated in response to its battles. You can also use any of these three monsters to get off the effects of Winder and Bezel Ship, fortunately enough. They provide great synergy with your existing timeline-jacking juveniles.  <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> is a vital monster that can be brought out just as easily as any of your other Xyz Monsters, the rationale for its utility being its Quick Effect that prevents your opponent from activating card effects in their GY for the turn. It and <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>, which acts as a walking MST, make perfect use of any Bezel Ship or Recorder that have been summoned from the grave via their respective effects so you can keep on recycling them as you please. <h3>Weaknesses</h3> Though Time Thieves are capable of some surprising muscle, they're not without their flaws. For one, the deck relies almost entirely on the Extra Deck for strong attacks and staying alive, the main deck monsters acting as mainly fodder for them and providing some quick utility here and there. Furthermore, when faced with high ATK monsters themselves, the deck faces issues regarding remaining LP from damage, especially after paying the Instant Fusion cost once or twice, hence the way Recorder is used in this situation. <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a> helps mitigate this a good bit, given the 500 ATK/DEF boost it grants to all DARK monsters and the 400 ATK/DEF drop it gives to LIGHT monsters.  Common hand traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> also give Redoer plenty of trouble if they're used in response to it, the former since its Quick Effect is easily negated due to including a drawing effect and the latter which straight-up destroys Redoer for activating its Quick Effect at all. For these reasons, consider substituting cards in the main or side deck for <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> if they scare you too much.  Shaddoll monsters, in general, are a problem, given how heavily they combat Special Summoned monsters. Given how heavily Redoer and other Extra Deck monsters are used in the deck, it's no surprise as far as the challenge they pose. If your fingers are crossed, a good Lost Wind will hopefully send them home packing after an activation and some sound thinking from there on out. <h3>Conclusion</h3> At the end of the day, Time Thieves show a ton of potential given the way they run and the surprise of being on the receiving end of them.

Just use your normal spinny/fowl strategies to try to get a link-3 or link-4 as fast as possible on the board. I also left in a Brionac if you need to do something with dead draws like Ash and Ghost, since getting a Level 6 Synchro on the field with this deck is surprisingly easy. You can replace it with any good generic level 5-6 synchro and that would also work. Other than that, Borreload is the win condition, and if you want, OTK with the Violent Chimera, it's pretty nutty."

The main card you want to use to get the link out is Soulpiercer as it lets you get a +1. The main card you want to use the links effect on is scale, as it also can let you +1 if you discarded it then special summoned it. Having Soulpiercer is a one card combo to get the link and two monster on board plus whatever other cards you might have, like trumpter to special summon Warlord. However, Superheavy Samurai are really good at swarming the board and bring out the synchros to hit the opponent hard."

This deck wins by slowly gaining advantage. Just keep popping cards and negating until your opponent runs out of plays or leaves an opening for a direct attack.  Naturia Bamboo shoot is easy to tribute summon and great for control against back row heavy decks.  Vulnerable to non targeting destruction/banish.  Gets better with MR5. Being able to Synchro Ancient sacred Wyvern without having to use up big Jasmine's link zone for him. Makes it so much better."

Draw, clean the opponent's side or blowe up field (without yours m","TACTICS - with this deck you can do a lot of amazing combos. Is like  <em>Fifty</em> Shades of <em>Grey. I will show you some examples:</em>  COMBO 1 ( Black Rose Dragon+ co-linked Cerberus and other links)  We are starting from ""ib the world chalice justiciar"" combo. SS ""crystron needlefiber"" we use his effect SS ""x saber airbellum"" and we use ""ib the world chalice justiciar""effect SS ""world chalice guardragon"" on him ""guardragon elpy"". Then ""world chalice guardragon"" in GY, SS Guardragon Pisty. Nowe ""guardragon elpy"" effect SS ""omni dragon brotaur"" select  ""x saber airbellum"" and add ""rescue ferret"". We are using ""world legacy guardragon"" to change positions ""omni dragon brotaur"" and we use ""Guardragon Pisty"" we use SS ""world chalice guardragon"". We are leaving ""omni dragon brotaur"" and ""x saber airbellum"". From the rest SS ""saryuja skull dread"" we using draw effect and his SS effect to SS ""rescue ferret"". ""Rescue ferret"" effect then SS ""red rose dragon"",""synchro fusionist"",""Glow-Up Bulb"". Of the first two monsters we SS ""garden rose maiden"" and we use effects  ""garden rose maiden"" and ""red rose dragon"" and ""synchro fusionist"". We use ""Frozen rose"" on ""Glow-Up Bulb"". ""Knightmare Cerberus"" on ""omni dragon brotaur"" and ""white rose dragon"". Nowe ""brilliant fusion"" we use ""performage trick clown"" and we use his effect and ""gem knight lazuli"" effect. On ""performage trick clown"" and ""garden rose maiden"" we SS ""cross rose dragon"". We NS 1 monster from hand and we use him and ""gem knight seraphinite"" and ""x saber airbellum"" for link S ""knightmare unicorn"". ""Glow-Up Bulb"" effect in Gy. Now we are waiting for good moment for blowe up field ;)  COMBO 2 (Exodia FTK)  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-synchro-turbo-draw-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-synchro-turbo-draw-2020/</a>  COMBO 3 (Borr + F.A. + Abyss  Dweller)  Same combo start after SS ""garden rose maiden"" and SS ""white rose dragon"" we use ""Frozen rose"" on ""Glow-Up Bulb"". On ""garden rose maiden"" and ""x saber airbellum"" we SS ""borreload savage dragon"". Nowe ""brilliant fusion"" we use ""performage trick clown"" and we use his effect and ""gem knight lazuli"" effect. On ""performage trick clown"" and  ""white rose dragon"" we SS ""Abyss  Dweller"". ""Glow-Up Bulb"" effect in Gy. On ""omni dragon brotaur"", ""Glow-Up Bulb"" and ""gem knight seraphinite"" we SS F.A. Dawn Dragster.  Nowe we can use Black Garden.  COMBO  4 (Number S0: Utopic Zexal)  for this combo we will need corrections in deck and extra deck. In deck we remove ""Black Garden"" and ""Frozen rose"" and we add 1""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"" and 1 card you like hahaha. In Extra deck we must add 4 XYZ monsters  Number 71 + Number S0: Utopic Zexal +Number 39 + Number S39. And 2 Synchro Old Entity Cthugua + tin musical battlemech and 1 more  saryuja skull dread. Same combo start, I leave the rest for you ;)  COMBO 5,6  I leave this place for you. Share interesting ideas for these combo in the comments. The most interesting I will join here. Aroma, Calamity other synchro there are still many roads.  &nbsp; <div class=""ZUo4Ze"">  All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck. <p class=""LC20lb DKV0Md"">Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.</p> Very interesting and  short link combo starting from one card, with an overwhelming end result. Thanks to the fact that we only need one card we have more cards to counteract the opponent's cards.  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/1-card-new-broken-links-tokens-combo-2020/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/1-card-new-broken-links-tokens-combo-2020/</a>  Lucky coin deck but not only that.

Sets up constant good board with 3-4 negates, turn one or two.","The main premise of this deck is to either; a) use one of the three engines - speedroid, trickstar or sky striker - to turbo out two monsters and link away into verte anaconda, or b) hard draw red-eyes fusion and activate it. Another way to get the 2nd dragun is to use the magicalized fusion and banish the two targets that you used on either anaconda, or the actual card itself.  Some people prefer to use retro dragon over wyvern - but I find that you rarely summon it. With insight, you can pitch it to the grave then bring back red-eyes next turn. There's also a glitch on YGOPRO that allows you to use wyvern as a target for red-eyes fusion, so thats handy.  Overall, this deck is a solid 8/10. The ideal board is two-three counter traps and a dragun on board - two if you're lucky. This deck can deal out damage quick, and can go second or third. The only downside is the fact its OCG - sorry TCG players xD"

You get pretty good draws going second mostly. Really had no bad match ups unless it was Cyberse or certain Link monsters/decks that could spam repeatedly (there was several Link decks I've beaten although). The win ratio is not bad. Very fun to play in a tournament and very unpredictable to throw them off with other combos. If you're Link monster player, you can make it a Link format (I dont like playing meta or Links too much since most of them are overpowered. Kills the fun for me so...) and do other combos."

The premise is to just fill up your hand with fairy monsters for more negates. <a data-name=""Eva"">Eva</a> lets you extend more by banishing 2 monsters from your grave to add 2 cards - which allows you to stack up even more negates. <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> allows you to freely summon a 2400 beatstick and add a negate; which comes in handy as attack is pretty mediocre in this deck.

A strategy that you might want to use to clutch out wins going first is to set up disruptions during your opponents turn - (<a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization)</a> - to stop your opponents plays in hopes of coming in clutch and taking it back in your next turn.  Overall; I'd give this deck a solid 7/10. I doesn't struggle with consistency - but there are many handtraps/other forms of disruption that hurt this deck a lot. Going second, this deck will make you feel like Saitama from One Punch Man , however, going first it will make you feel like Tom from Tom &amp; Jerry. You may have luck on your side, but chances of you winning are pretty slim. Still this a fun deck that could definetely get you X-2 at your locals."

I didn't include hand traps because I'm not a fan of them, however Needle-fiber can summon T.G wonder magician in you opponents turn which counts as an extra-deck trap and can destroy a spell/trap + can summon Onimaru if you have a lvl7 on the field. The yang-zing engine is mostly used with Simoon to summon Full armor master which can't be destroyed by battle. This is a 2.5 card combo, you need Simoon, Bi'an plus any black-wing. first you use Simoon's effect to set Whirlwind (which can be recovered with Zephyros' effect in other combos) then you normal summon it and search for Orochi, normal summon Bi'an and special summon Orochi et Voila you got an almost unbeatable Wall which cannot be destroyed by battle, unaffected by all effects and can steal and destroy opponent's monsters."

Uses a lot of spicy and interesting techs and even utilizes the new","Here's a quick Cubic deck that I whipped up. The main focus is to abuse the very easy ability to always get <a data-name=""Vijam the Cubic Seed "">Vijam the Cubic Seed </a> out on board; and to try to turbo out as many copies of <a data-name=""Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord"">Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord</a> as possible. The extra deck is pretty linear based on the fact that you use <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, which means you dont really go into it as often. Trinity is mainly there if you want to go into it - thats why It's the only extra deck card thats a three-of.  A good tech that really helps you gain lifepoint advantage over your opponent is <a data-name=""Speedburst Dragon"">Speedburst Dragon</a>. When playing Cubics, you take a lot of lifepoint damage using effects that help you gain board presence. Most of the time your opponent also takes the damage, but Speedburst allows you to get a free 2400 beatstick on board and deal extra burn damage to your opponent while also gaining half of the lifepoints you lost. Later on of course you can use it as Xyz material for <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a>, which allows you to further dish out damage to your opponent enabling that OTK.  In conclusion, this deck is a nice 6/10. Its a very rogue and casual deck, and when used right - can finish your opponent off in the blink of an eye. The only major problem/fault with Cubics is their inability to bounce back if their main combos get negated. I run extra deck cards like <a data-name=""Outer Entity Azathot"">Outer Entity Azathot</a> or <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> to clutch out wins, but once your opponents sets up heavy barriers on your plays - you primarily scoop. I just really enjoy the originality and consistency the deck has. Give me suggestions on cards you think should be added."

One of the easiest ways to get 6 ","Sharks. Are. Broken. With the latest support announced in 'Eternity Code' - Sharks could never have been more consistent with setting up very good and incredibly powerful negates. Going first, you can almost always end on at least one <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (that is of course if you either brick hard or your plays get disrupted). With the new, incredible way to open up with 2 level 4 water monsters using the effect of <a data-name=""Cutter Shark"">Cutter Shark</a> - you could easily overlay into so many disruptions; <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, etc.  A good way to get another free disruption without paying much cost is to run <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon"">Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon</a>. This card is amazing at negating <em>all </em>of your opponents monster effects and has a formidable 3000 attack (which means it will be quite easy at running over your opponents boss monsters). Similar to <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>, F0 has the ability to not only negate your opponents effects, but to the take control of the monster itself (a sort of widow anchor with legs).  To summon F0, you simply have to open up with <a data-name=""Xyz Remora"">Xyz Remora</a> in hand. What it allows you to do is to detach two materials from a monster on field - and then special summon two shark monsters along with it. Overlay into Bahamut and, after using his effect, overlay him and another Xyz and make F0. Remora appears a lot in hand - due to <a data-name=""Generation Force "">Generation Force </a> allowing there to be 6 copies of it in deck.  Another great addition to the deck is the new trap card; <a data-name=""Xyz Revive Splash"">Xyz Revive Splash</a>. By activating it, you can revive a <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> from grave and set up another negate. Its second effect also allows you to rank-up into cards like <a data-name=""Valiant Shark Lancer"">Valiant Shark Lancer</a> or <a data-name=""Number C101: Silent Honor DARK"">Number C101: Silent Honor DARK</a> that rid your opponent of 1 extra monster - all by banishing it from the grave.  Overall - This deck gets a hard 8.5/10. Its good, consistent, and most importantly unique. With so many new support cards to play with and not necessarily any archetype restrictions; this deck allows you to play around with different cards and make different end boards that can pull themselves up and give your opponent a tough time. Going second, this deck still has a lot to offer. The only problem is - like any Xyz toolbox deck - so many cards chain together to summon more and more monsters, that it may be real easy to stop your plays with a single <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> if your hand is mediocre. Either way this is one of my favourite decks to be released in the 2020 format, and I'm counting the days till it becomes TCG legal."

It utilizes the Windwitch engine to set up negates for free - and maxes out on disruptio","As you probably already know; the focus of this deck is to abuse <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> as much as possible and fill your board up with fusion monsters. You mostly want to go into <a data-name=""Mechaba"">Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""Raidjin"">Raidjin</a> - as their effects allow you to disrupt your opponents plays a lot more. The good thing about <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> is the fact that it recycles your Aleister's a lot more, allowing for you to abuse their effects and fill your board.  The windwitch engine also complements this deck well. It allows to synchro climb using <a data-name=""Ice Bell"">Ice Bell</a> and <a data-name=""Glass Bell"">Glass Bell</a>; which, in the end of it all, can allow you access to a free <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>. Another reason why its so good is the fact it doesn't use up a normal summon; meaning you can go off on your Invoked combos straight after, and have a formidable board for your opponent to face. The only downside is you cannot use your Thunder Dragon monsters afterwards - due to the additional clause on <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a> locking you out of summoning any monsters that arent WIND attribute, and above the level of 5. However, you can still easily summon your <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> and have a good negate on board to stop your opponent.  Finally, I run the Thunder Dragon engine. This in theory is pretty simple, and the main reason its here is to block your opponent from searching during their turn - as stated on Thunder Dragon Colossus' effect. You mainly want to max out on all the DARK attribute thunder dragons, thats why I run 2 <a data-name=""Dragonroar"">Dragonroar</a>s and 2 <a data-name=""Dragondarks"">Dragondarks</a>.  To finish off - I would give this deck a very reasonable score of 6/10. The combos are pretty linear - but it does lead to some rather impressive boards. What cripples the deck most though; is the issue of the 'lock-out' clause. Turn 1 - you have to decide if you want to end on a possible board of 1-2 <a data-name=""Mechabas"">Mechabas</a> and a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> - or <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> and a few <a data-name=""Raidjins"">Raidjins</a>. Either way, you're able to set up a decent amount of disruptions for your opponent, and it wont be a ride in the park for them to break your board; that I guarantee."

The guardians are very difficult to summon because of their equip cards. Of course in the anime, Rafael uses the anime-only card Backup Gardna to transfer equip cards. I tried to make the deck somewhat competitive in video games like Legacy of the Duelist, so this is what I got. It's not designed to win you any tournaments, but to have some fun playing like Rafael.  Yes, I know Pot of Greed is on the banlist, but this deck is so problematic, it's not going to help you win much. The ideal first play in this deck is activating Seal of Orichalcos and then special summoning Eatos with no monsters in the graveyard. If you special summon Eatos and then activate the Seal, Eatos will be destroyed. Swords is a great stall card while you use cards like Arsenal Summoner to search your deck. Pot of Avarice is there to keep the graveyard clear for Eatos. It's also great to use Shrink after an opponent's monster declares an attack to destroy it.  I really tried to include Elma in this deck, but it makes it very problematic. Even if you were somehow able to summon her with her Equip card attached and the Seal activated, you would have a monster with 2100 attack. That's what Arsenal Summoner gives you, and Knight Day Grepher with 100 more attack, both having better abilities of adding a card you want to your hand.  Let me know in the comments if you have a better Rafael deck."

I've been building and testing decks lately that can most utilize the Master Rule update and this one has some real potential. It's remarkably consistent, amazingly recurrable, and fun (at least for you). The deck can easily play through and stop disruptions and nearly every hand can get you AT LEAST a toad + disruption and at most ends on multiple negates.  &nbsp;  Card Choices and Strategy:  &nbsp;  -3x Right-Hand Shark: Adds Left-Hand Shark on normal. Water XYZ monsters summoned with it as material can't be destroyed by batter, which might keep a floating Bahamut Shark alive for more Toads next turn.  -1x Left-Hand Shark: Can be Specialled from the hand for Star Boy Material or dumped to the grave and summoned for free for XYZ spam.  3x Cutter Shark: 1 card Toad/Dweller/Anything you want.  2x Lantern Shark: On normal Specials another water from hand. 2 is enough.  2x XYZ Remora: Summon Dreadnaught, Detectch 2, and get 3 Sharks on field for more plays. 3 bricks. At worst, it's another lvl 4 Water.  1x Double Fin Shark: Specials a Fish from grave When Normal. Drawing 1 is good. Drawing 2 or more is awful.  3x White Stingray: It summons itself from the hand by pitching a water, which other cards can take advantage of.  3x Silent Angler: Summons itself from the hand for free. (Make sure you summon it last as it locks you out of summoning from the hand)  2X Aqua Spirit: Level 4 Water that Easily summons itself.  1x Tenyi Spirit: Level 4 Water that Easily summons itself.  3x White Mirror: It's Monster Reborn + ROTA for the deck. It's busted.  2x Water Hazard: Get's you another monster on field. It's decent Negate-bait as well.  3x Instant Fusion: Get's you another Level 4 water or Millennium Eyes Restrict to stop handtraps.  1x Monster Reborn: No introduction needed.  3x Crossout Designator: Ya, you probably forgot about this one. Read it again. It's called by the grave that can negate called by the grave. It's the reason for the strange one of's at the end. Outside of the mirror match, here's all of the relevant targets in the deck - Instant Fusion, Monster Reborn, Pot of Desires, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, and even Double or Nothing. If you are skeptical of the card choice, just try it out. I've had a lot of success with it. Take it out and clean up the handtrap ratio's if you don't like it.  &nbsp;  ---Extra Deck---  Room is tight here. Toads can add back Themselves and Bahamut Sharks as needed (You can easily summon many in a duel). Feel free to test other options, but these 15 cards were the best choice.  ---Side Deck---  Put in whatever you prefer.  &nbsp;  If you check the deck out, please feel free to leave any suggestions/opinions in the comments.  Good luck."

Very fun for locals - and very quick to pick up. Hope you have a wonderful new year using this,"I want to start today's deck overview with wishing everyone a Happy New Year. I wish all of you a great 2020 - and remember to keep on being the awesome duelists you all are. Anyways - I'd like to start 2020 with this cheap and <em>quite</em> rogue deck build I made a while back. It focus' on continuously manipulating your opponents field by destroying cards they control.  On first glance; this deck might seem cloggy and weak (with the only two monsters in it being <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>) However, I assure you that using all the search and draw power in this deck - you open up with an ideal hand quite regularly. This deck requires you to only have two cards in hand for you to pull your combo off.  You usually end up only having <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> on field - as you use Rod as fodder for <a data-name=""Illusion Magic"">Illusion Magic</a> - which allows you to run a Phantasm Spiral 'engine'. The way <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> works is, if you dont control any effect monsters - you can special summon one 'Pacifis Token' to your side of the field with 2000 ATK. Then, when you special that token, you're allowed to add a Phantasm trap to your hand. This give you extra disruption alongside <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> meaning you can stack up ways to destroy your opponents cards - spell, trap or monster.  You can also overlay into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> using two of your magicians (If of course you haven't banished it off of <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>). Then you can use a card like circle to pop your dragon - which will bring out <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> from the extra.  To wrap it up; I have fallen in love with this deck. It's so interesting and different - and a good refresher from all these current format decks. The playstyle is different, the strategy is different. It strays away from the classic <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> decks, but in a unique and positive way. I'd give this deck a 8/10. Definitely not the strongest deck out there - but a very budget and very fun deck to play (for your opponent and you). Happy New Year everyone; hope 2020 brings you lots of joy and a whole lot of dueling."

The fact of the matter is, for the foreseeable future (until the next ban list) we have this deck slated at the top.  &nbsp;  <span>Basic Combo:</span>  • Open one of your 3 starters (1 ROTA [goes into 2 of your starters], 1 <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Dark Grepher"">Dark Grepher</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>)  --&gt; Alternatively, you can open one any other monster that can be Normal Summoned + <a data-name=""Foolish"">Foolish</a>  [Step 1]: Normal Starter, then foolish <a data-name=""Harp Horror"">Harp Horror</a>  [Step 2]: Banish Harp to Special <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from Deck  [Step 3]: Make <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> with Knightmare &amp; your Normal Summon  [Step 4]: Use Galatea to shuffle your banished Harp, setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>  [Step 5]: Banish Knightmare in GY to send <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Wand""</a> from your Deck to the GY  [Step 6]: Use ""World Wand"" to Special Summon the banished Knightmare  [Step 7]: Make <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a> using Galatea, and attach the banished ""World Wand""  [Step 8]: Make I:P <a data-name=""Masquerena"">Masquerena</a> using Dingirsu and the Knightmare  [Step 9]: Activate your Set Babel and win the Duel (you can send either Harp or Cymbal to the GY off your Knightmare; sending Harp during your opponent's turn allows you to Special Cymbal from Deck which enables your I:P to get out Knightmare Unicorn, after which you can banish the Cymbal in GY to Special Summon Dingirsu --&gt; you can also send Cymbal instead to Summon a Galatea for a Link 4 play, or Dingirsu for an earlier disruption, from which you can make Knightmare Unicorn with I:P).  &nbsp;  <span>Cards that should be considered:</span>  • Handtraps: Phantazmay, D.D. Crow, Skull Meister, Ash, Imperm, Nibiru, Veiler  --&gt; I'm not a fan of Phantazmay, but it is a solid card this format (especially in this deck)  --&gt; not a fan of main deck skull meister unless you're certain you'll be facing Orcust; crow follows the same theory (but it's weaker vs. Orcust)  • Additional options: ""Into the Void"" is ok if you're not running hand traps (so not this variant), Dangers! can be ok in some variants of Orcust (not this variant), going 2nd cards can be good (if you're into that sort of thing), and more Striker cards can also be good as they offer versatility going 1st &amp; 2nd (really solid if you opt to go that route here, but don't overdo it). Also, as pointed out by a member in the comments, it is worth considering the scrap engine:  &nbsp;  <span>Continued Deck Theory:</span>  • Why are the Striker cards good here?: You'll often find that the Striker engine really only serves 2 purposes in any given Orcust deck. To offer an extension with desperately bad hands (see hornet drones), and to offer disruption (see widow anchor/shark cannon). What makes these cards even better, however, is that when you're not drawing into them - you're likely drawing a way into them (@engage). Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage! doesn't just give you access to an incredible toolbox, it also stacks advantage by drawing a free card when activated with 3 or more spells in the GY (which is easy enough when you run 18 spells, of which most are draw cards). Having said all of that, it is worth noting that the Sky Striker cards do have a major drawback. When your field is clogged up with monsters in the Main Monster Zones, it is all but impossible to rely on the Sky Striker cards. What Orcust does exceptionally well, that allows it to play around this conditional disadvantage, is that it is capable of committing massive resources with ease &amp; that it is capable of moving key pieces of its engine to the GY. These two factors ensure that when a Sky Striker card is needed, it is usually accessible.  • What else should be considered in the Striker package?: Shizuku has a lot going for it in this Deck, but I simply didn't like the idea of playing it over Topologic Bomber Dragon. Shizuku doesn't offer the same explosive disruption as Bomber, but it does allow you to dig into your Sky Striker engine (which may end up being useful for going 2nd). In addition to Shizuku, Jamming Waves &amp; Afterburners are also worth considering. Both of these cards are strictly for going 2nd/breaking a board, and they are relatively useful in doing so - however they do not see play in this Deck, or really any variations of this deck, because they are inconsistent outside of these situations. Not to mention, Orcust is a deck that is relatively resilient, and going 2nd it can OTK with ease - so main decking bricky options to break a board may not be the best option."

The only comparable with IB combo decks. Which makes this deck one of the top leaders. Thanks to the application ""Primathmech Alembertian""certainly we not stuck with unwanted equipe spell in hand. I personally do not use FTK deks (except test) I prefer LOCKDOWN ;)  TACTICS - In simple words, the most important thing we need, are 3 cards which you can put Bushido Counter (one of them must be ""gateway of the six""). Then we can conduct infinite ADD SS loop. At the beginning we should activate cards we cen put Bushido Counter on them. Secondly SS ""Great General of the Six Samurai"". Use him add ""gateway of the six"" and activate. 2 more SS under the arrows ""Great General of the Six Samurai"" (in the meantime we add monters using cards with Bushido Counter - beyond I won't mention it anymore). From this 2 monsters we SS ""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"" we add monster and use her SS effect, SS monster under the arrows ""Great General of the Six Samurai"". More 2 SS six samurai and we SS ""saryuja skull dread"" and we use him 2 effects. If we don't have 3 cards which we can put Bushido Counter more SS Six Samurai and ""saryuja skull dread"". Once we get 3 cards which you can put Bushido Counter we can conduct infinite ADD SS loop. And we go to the right combo. 3 SS ""Kizan"" we SS ""Primathmech Alembertian"" we add ""Amazon archer"" and SS. Next SS tribute loop. <div class=""ZUo4Ze""> <div>All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.</div> </div> Please check my other decks.

Feel like the master of faster, and synchro-climb your way to making negates for","Happy New Year everyone. I know I've already said that in my last deck breakdown - <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> <a data-name=""Pacifis"">Pacifis</a> - but I'd like to wish you guys a great upcoming 2020 once more. Konami has spoiled the OCG immensely - meaning there is now countless new support cards for just about every deck imaginable (Check out my previous decks if you're interested). So I'm going to be single-handedly taking on each archetype thats gonna rise to power in April of this year. Today, I'll focus on RDA - <a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a> (ft. Resonators)  Without wasting any time, I'll get into your main combos. The key card in this deck is hands-down <a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a>. You always want to somehow go into it - as its the main combo starter nowadays. Since he's a level six synchro, the two obvious tuners that you will search for are <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>. Luckily, they both have an effect which allows them to bring out more monsters, so you wont struggle to start-up your combo.  The new spell card - <a data-name=""Command Resonator"">Command Resonator</a> - allows you to search a level four fiend. What you search varies heavily on what you're hand or field is. If played well, you could get up to this point without using your Normal Summon. If you're going second against a backrow deck: Traptrix, True Draco, Artifact, etc - you can automatically spin your opponents backrow on summon using the effect of <a data-name=""Holding Legs"">Holding Legs</a>. Since its a level four, you can use both it and a resonator for <a data-name=""Red Rising Drago"">Red Rising Drago</a>n - to start your entire combo. It being a fiend also makes it searchable off of the spell, which comes in handy.  After that its simple. Just try to make as many disruptions as you can.<a data-name=""Hot red Dragon Archfiend Abyss""> Hot red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> allows you to negate a Spell/Trap. <a data-name=""Red Rain"">Red Rain</a> allows you to nuke your opponents monsters during their turn, and adds itself back to hand when you Synchro Summon another monster.  Overall; this deck deserves a 7.5/10. Its very, <em>very </em>consistant, and will almost always get you two formidable synchro monsters on field + a bunch of negates in your spell and trap zone. Recommend this to players just starting yugioh or people without a deck ready for Master Rule 5."

Vanquish your opponents board using your True Kings, and beat them do","Let me start it off simple: this deck is great. With every single card being good in the opening hand - and barely any way to brick, this deck will wipe your opponent clean of any hope. With the brand new card being announced - <a data-name=""Jewel Beast - Argosaurus"">Jewel Beast - Argosaurus</a> - Konami proves that pills are always the answer. This new dinky dino allows you to search your <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>, and <em>enlarge </em>your board with it. Never before has summoning two <a data-name=""Ultimate Conducter Tyranno"">Ultimate Conducter Tyranno</a>'s been easier -  this new support truly brings out the best in our Paleozoic Pals.  If I'm going to be honest - this deck doesn't really have a finite combo. What makes True King Dinos so unique is their lack of a combo based strategy. All you really want to do is continuously pitch your <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> to the grave using of a plethora of cards - <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>, <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>, <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a>. Then, you can use its effect to special summon <a data-name=""Argosaurus"">Argosaurus</a> from the deck. From there you just try to combo-off and use <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> to solve all your problems. You can also pitch two dinosaurs to bring out <a data-name=""Agnimazud"">Agnimazud</a> or <a data-name=""Bahrastos"">Bahrastos</a> - which both banish cards your opponent controls (Traps and Monsters respectively)  Overall, This deck gets a good 8/10. It can quite easily drop a <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>, but other than that ts mainly an OTK based deck. Still, the new support is great; it's easily searchable, and definitely has a powerful effect. This is, in my opinion, one of the better builds out there."

Ash and Lava Golem are good for bored control. Dracoverlord can be summoned using Advance and when he hits the board he has a great effect that's very useful. Out of being experimental I decided to run Caius instead of Zaborg but guys you can either out, both are good to run I feel. Still in the play testing phase with this deck on ratios and different tech ideas, but so far so good with this set up."

While this deck is a bit old, it's still a menace ","If you thought wrapping your head around my RDA list from a fortnight back was hard - yet alone yesterday's True King Dinosaurs - today's list will fry your brain like an egg cracked onto an Australian street. I present to you - my Burning Abyss deck (ft.<a data-name=""Block Dragon""> Block Dragon</a> and friends). When I was originally brainstorming for what deck to do - I thought about running Burning Abyss on its own: in theory this deck could work out, however playing with a couple of test hands and comparing the results was rather shocking and disappointing. Shocking in the fact that this deck was clearly better - going X-2. And disappointing in the fact that I would then have to remake the deck.  Playing this deck is rather simple. It strays away from how regular BA play - summon 3 copies of <a data-name=""Dante, Traveller of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveller of the Burning Abyss</a> - going into <a data-name=""Beatrice"">Beatrice</a> and pass. This deck can utilize Block Dragon to its advantage: ending on boards such as <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>, <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna"">Fossil Dyna</a>, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Saryuja"">Saryuja</a> and <a data-name=""Beatrice"">Beatrice</a>. The main and simple concept is to get enough monsters to use block dragon - and to keep on special summoning. A lot of the cards in this deck have re-occurring effects or ones that allow them to bring themselves forward while also somehow plussing. You can make easy negate using cards like <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a> or <a data-name=""Gallis the Star Beast"">Gallis the Star Beast</a>. Again, like most combo heavy decks - this relies on how optimally you open. You could also easily end on a <a data-name=""Hydralander"">Hydralander</a> for extra disruptions during your opponents turn.  A good EARTH attribute monster that not many people take seriously is <a data-name=""Kumongous"">Kumongous</a>. Not many people suspect Kaijus, especially from a combo oriented deck. If you want to go for the OTK with<a data-name=""Borrelsword""> Borrelsword</a>, you can rid your opponent of their ace card without having to worry about negations. This could become an out to cards like <a data-name=""Dragun of Red-Eyes"">Dragun of Red-Eyes</a> which arguably will become problematic if its announced in the TCG.  Overall, this deck deserves a strong 6.5/10. It pushes through negates like crazy with a million ways to start your combos and even more ways to extend. While being a going 2nd deck, you can OTK your opponent with minimal effort. The only problem is it falls flat mid-combo. Starting it is not a problem - but finishing it definitely is. Luckily, this deck is pretty rogue so your opponent might not always <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> an important card - but when they do, it hurts like hell. So much so that chainblocking sometimes comes in clutch for you to end your opponent. Still one of the most fun decks I've yet to play, even if it's ever so slightly complicated.."

I am a big fan of this strategy due to its extremely unique playstyle, and amazing card art. Without further ado, I would like to walk you through some of my card choices and what the strongest combo lines are.  To start I play a going first variant with a going second variant in the side deck. Basically, if you have to go second game one that's okay you should still be able to play, but going first is preferred as a lot of the extra deck choices are meant to sit on the field and prevent OTK's if you brick. This includes cards like white aura dolphin which can be made with psychic wheelder and blue layer. This card allows you to soak up a few attacks if you have a blue layer in the grave. You can switch it out for Goyo Guardian if you are going second. The other really big going first cards are the artifact cards. In the main deck I play one Scythe and one Morraltech. I also play one lancea in the side. I play three sanctums so that you can play desires and still have a chance to draw it, as well as the two trap trick so that you can draw into it even easier. The artifacts work decently in this deck because Grampulse can destroy spell and traps on your opponent's turn if it has blue layer as a material. That's pretty much it for the going first cards, you can take all of these out if you are going second for the cards that rely more on your opponent playing.  Now for how you want to use each of the Super Quant cards.  Red Layer- Opening this cards means that you probably won the game. You almost always want to summon him first unless your hand is extremely stacked. Both effects are once per turn but you have a lot of ways to get him in the grave (ie white layer, or any of the Dangers). You special summon any super quant from the grave when he is sent, which can include the mechs. This guy goes to grave a lot so make sure you shuffle multiple copies of him back with blue layer if you can.  Always play 3.  White Layer - The newest super quant monster allows you to really unbrick your hand if all you have drawn is one other super quant. You can normal the other one and special this one for free. If it's blue then you can make a grampulse for free. If it's green then you just special this and get its effect. Red is probably the worst one to pair with white just because the discard may not be live for red. Either way, White layer is very versatile and puts Alphan back in your hand when it goes to the grave. This can be used to help you turbo magna off the field spell, or it can help you rebuild a board on turn two. Play 3 as well.  Blue Layer - Blue layer is used for two things: searching the field spell, and shuffling back red. With that being said Blue layer is the easiest to get in a mech so Grampulse will almost always be on board. You play three cause you need the recursion, and there is no real way to search it.  Green Layer - Green is sort of lack luster. Unless you are playing a spellcaster variant with summoner monk he isn't very useful. You don't want to use his graveyard effect often due to the fact that you have to throw a super quant out of your hand. The one good way to do this is to send Green and White off of Alphan, and put Alphan in your hand then discard it again. This is a free plus one, but its not all that useful. In addition, Aeroboros is, in my opinion, the worst of the mechs. It is decent now in the link era, but with MR5 I see it being less useful. I only play 2 but you could play a third.  Alphan - This little bunny is so great for the strategy. The only time it's bad is when you open only it and White Layer, but that's part of why you're only playing two. On top of that White Layer lets you recur it from the grave for free so you don't even need to waste your blue on shuffling it back in. He is always in your hand so you don't need to play 3.  Thats pretty much it, this deck can easily and consistently make the boss and one other mech to help support it. You can spin monsters left and right with Magna and it is so fun to do. On top of that, it is non-targeting, non-destruction, and he is unaffected by card effects. Oh and did I mention that he can stop your opponent from adding cards to their hands if it has 6 materials.  This deck was decent before and now with master rule 5, it has a lot of potential to be rouge.  Hope you enjoy and please leave a comment below on what you think I could change."

Facing True Dracos and worrying about their deadly traps? Just counter them with cosmic cyclone or just completely lock them down with Denko Sekka, scared of facing Thunder Dragons with a Colossus and Titan on field - just Kaiju the Colossus.  This deck has many resources and is amazing going 2nd.  You can make it work with going first too but it's better going second since you can make use of the Kaiju Slumber.  And the best part is: You can make it for under 30 bucks.  Enjoy."

Truly ,"What an awesome deck. For those of you guys who aren't familiar with Mathmechs - a deck that 'recently' came out in the TCG in the set Mystic Fighters - it is simply another cyberse deck: however, <em>it </em>specializes in spamming the board with monsters and going into one of the most broken cyberse synchros in order to OTK your opponent. <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> not only has the ability to double its attack during damage calculation - but with its one turn boost using the effect of <a data-name=""Mathmech Multiplication"">Mathmech Multiplication</a> - can easily deal damage exceeding that of 10,000 Lifepoints. Unlike my Crusadia build from a while back - which you should still check out as it specializes in some bonkers combos to annihilate your opponent <a data-name=""Equimax"">Equimax</a> - this deck can ruin your opponents career in just a few simple steps (all depending on your hand of course)  The easiest and most simple combo only really relies on you having two cards in hand. What you'd want to do to kick-start your combos is normal summon <a data-name=""Balancer Lord"">Balancer Lord</a>. This card is a great starter monster and easily searchable off of cards like Cynet Mining. What it allows you to do is for the cost of only 1000 LP, conduct another normal summon of a cyberse monster - so using his effect, you can bring out <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a>. It has a very nice effect that allows you to pop your other cyberse monster and bring out the card that enables it all; Mathmech Multiplication. This card can make your Nabla a level 8 -  and since its a tuner - 4 + 8 = 12. Thats some maths that even your 36 year old algebra teacher would be proud of. So now that you have made Final Sigma - you can use Multiplications effect from grave and boost his attack to 6000!!  Conditionally, you're opponent might have something that would negate your combo - <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a>, <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. But fear not; because you run a set of cards that not many people respect in today's format - Kaiju's. If your having problems with a card your opponent controls - just use <a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>. Or just straight up <a data-name=""Gameciel"">Gameciel</a> them if you have him in hand. Either way, it shouldn't be too hard to break boards with cards in your hand - so the OTK is still very viable.  Going first this deck obviously suffers slightly -  but thats part of the reason why I run <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> in the extra deck. You can benefit easily benefit off of the Link engine; special summoning two mathmechs and going into <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> in order to draw 1 and get two tokens on field. After that you can use a token to make <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and then <a data-name=""I:P &lt;a data-name=&quot;Masquarena&quot;&gt;Masquarena&lt;/a&gt;"">I:P </a><a data-name=""Masquarena"">Masquarena</a> using disciple and the kuriboh on field. Using kuriboh's second effect - you can bring it back from the grave using your other token and on your opponents turn make Avramax.  Overall, this deck deserves a good 5/10. It's not the best deck out there - and like all OTK decks falls flat to handtraps. Sadly, the most we can do protection wise is hope we draw called by the grave. Still, this deck can manage to survive going first and hopefully pull off the OTK next turn, so it does have the safety aspect Crusadia lacked in my opinion. Still this deck is a good breather from the past two decks - being simple and surprisingly semi-budgety. I'd recommend this deck to those interested in OTK's or just people getting into the competitive scene. Be sure to watch out for tomorrow's deck as its going to be a <strong>powerhouse.</strong> Definitely something to look forward to so stay tuned for that."

With all this new indirect support: ABC are at an all time high. I spe,"Where do I even begin? This deck is outrageously good. Even for my standards - this deck can turbo out negates like they were nothing. I have yet to feel so passionately about a deck like this. It's generic, strong and consistent <em>as hell</em>! There will not be a time where you cant make <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> - and with the new indirect support announced, this deck will ruin your opponent and take you to the top! I'll be giving you a full breakdown on how to combo-off with this deck and vanquish your opponent off hope in just a few simple steps: trust me, it's as easy as ABC.  Before I give you a rundown on how the deck works; I'd like to go over the engines that I've decided to play in this undefeated union of cards. The main deck only consists of the primary four, with a sub-engine implemented as well. The engines are as follows: the ABC engine, the Gadget engine, the Symphonic engine &amp; the Danger! engine. All are assigned with a basic focus in mind - establishing solid negates. The ABC engine has been implemented in order to, quite <em>obviously</em>, turbo out your <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> (the main card in the deck). This pairs nicely with the gadget engine, as using the effects of <a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a> and <a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a> respectively, you can special summon pieces of the fusion monster from your hand. The symphonic engine has simply been put there to get an extra level 5 on board -  thats why the ratios between <a data-name=""Guitaar"">Guitaar</a> and <a data-name=""Miccs"">Miccs</a> are 3/1. And of course the Danger! monsters are simply there to get a free body on board to go further into your link plays: making <a data-name=""I:P Masquarena"">I:P Masquarena</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a>. The little 'sub-engine' I'm also referring to, is the triple <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> that I run. I'm using the term very loosely, so its not really an engine and  more rather just three cards that are searchable.  If you don't have a clue about the two new support cards - <a data-name=""Gizmek Yata"">Gizmek Yata</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a> - what they do is allow you to both extend your ABC plays <em>and</em> your Infinity combo. What Yata allows you to do is tribute your normal summoned monster and bring this card out onto the field. Then you can immediately after perform another normal summon, however you cannot summon monsters that are not the monster you just summoned's original type until the end phase. This is very good as it allows you to get a 2050, level five body on the field and perform <em>another </em>normal summon, however, this card locks you out of your Danger! engine while also stopping you from playing your other crucial negates from the extra deck. <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a>'s ability however is also very, <em>very </em>broken! This card allows you to equip itself to a monster you control (preferably your <a data-name=""Assault Core"">Assault Core</a>, <a data-name=""Buster Drake"">Buster Drake</a> or <a data-name=""Crush Wyvern"">Crush Wyvern</a>) and then either a) unequip itself and special summon it to the field or b) banish itself from the field and equip a level 4 or lower monster from your deck thats a union type. This is obviously very good as it can make summoning ABC a lot easier, and since its level five you can also benefit off of its special summon ability.  In conclusion, this deck deserves a powerful and hard 8.7/10. It might not be as meta as it used to during the ancient times of Master Rule 3, but it still is a great competitor and quite frankly a big sleeper deck in the new format. I think it has very good odds on topping one or two regionals - especially if we get Union Driver imported into the TCG rather quickly. The only shame with this deck is its brick factor. You mainly want the field spell in order to properly combo off - but with the amount of monsters its not allows easy. I'd consider maybe running a <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> in the side deck along with a target in order to access it easier. I also know quite a few people that run Planet Pathfinder.

Searching its own recursion (or more monsters) is also a big plus. On top of that, I realized that <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> and the <strong><em>Generaider</em></strong> cards are incredibly strong, so I decided to run cards to facilitate them. My deck probably could have emphasized the <strong><em>Generaider</em></strong> side a little more, but it ran well enough without them.</span> <h3><span><b>What tech choices did you play?</b></span></h3> <span><a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> is an incredibly strong card that I don’t think people have been taking advantage of. Being able to go into any generic synchro from level 6 to 9 off one card is incredibly useful. Specifically, I got a lot of use out of being able to flex between Marjoram, Berserker, and CQD.</span>  <span>Past that I played a small Dino Engine, and a small Zombie engine to facilitate <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>. I found that both were better than the <em><strong>Genex</strong></em> or <em><strong>Supay</strong></em> engines people had been running. I also chose to play a <strong><em>Danger!</em></strong> engine to help unbrick hands and play through disruption.</span> <h3><span><b>How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?</b></span></h3> <span>I expected Generaiders to be relevant, though I didn’t build for them quite enough. Had counted on being able to use <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> to pop <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Stage"">Generaider Boss Stage</a>, but <a data-name=""Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice"">Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice</a> says ""no"" to Synchro Monsters a little too well for me. Should probably have played another take-control card or main decked <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>.</span>  <span>Past that I didn’t really know what to expect that would give me too much trouble, so my side is a little too heavy towards a pendulum matchup I never had.</span> <h3><span><b>How were your matchups?</b></span></h3> <span>Really not terrible. Main issue was that my deck has a difficult time going second, cards like Nidhogg or really any disruption means I can’t get into my synchros, which means I’m usually left with an attack position Psi-Reflector or Armageddon Knight. Not exactly the best position. Luckily, the <strong><em>Dangers</em></strong> help mitigate this issue, and I run enough backrow that losing out on a first turn synchro usually doesn’t mean I’m out of the duel. Next month I might pick up another engine to help fix this issue.</span>  <span>Over the tournament, I found that a lot of decks have a hard time getting around a live Marjoram, and the ones that don’t have issues with it usually have an issue with Generaiders or Berserker.

Essentially, whenever I post a deck, I like to tell you guys about the good bits - as thats the main reason why I post this sort of stuff. However, even I almost get myself muddled up in a sense that I almost make it sound like every deck is Tier 1 amazing: which a lot of the times isn't the case. So today I've decided to reverse the psychology behind my deck and tell you all the flaws <em>I </em>faced when making the deck, to show and encourage you to make your own build of this archetype tailored to how you like it.  First thing that came up when putting together this set of cards, is the ratios. My original build saw quite a lot of dangers, which ended up being slightly bricky for this deck - as I ran too little ways to open up my extra deck and get the combos going. Thats why I'd recommend keeping a strong balance between the Shaddoll monsters and the Danger! cards - allowing you to open optimally way more and truly combo off into your negations like <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. You want to always max out on the semi-limited Dangers! as, their effects are the better ones out of all of them - and keep the level 8's at a low. The reason I don't run extra negation with cards like <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> or some solid protection + a pop effect like <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> - is because you only run the level 8's at a minimal - this is due to a) them being not that helpful towards the end board and being simply bodies and b) if you have two level 8 Danger! monsters on board - you should be beating down your opponent.  I'd say the Shaddoll fusion monster line-up is pretty stiff so theres not much room for change in that category. You want to always max out on <a data-name=""El Shaddol Construct"">El Shaddol Construct</a>. This is due it to be a very powerful 2800 body that instantly pops special summoned monsters and has a built in <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> thats obviously really good with Shaddolls. The new card, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, is very good during the grind game - thats why you only want one due to it being situational. And winda is a standard disruption of sorts with it locking your opponent out of special summoning.  Overall, this deck deserves a hard-earned 6.3/10. Definitely not my best deck yet but a strong and consistent one for sure. It's pretty good at stopping your opponent, with the added boost of the dangers helping you out in making some pretty strong boards. Depending on the match-up, this deck could be a <em>very </em>tough competitor - plus, it uses one of the most fan favourite archetypes currently in the game. Could see this getting a cute regional top or two - but I doubt it will ever impact the game in such a drastic way like other support thats come out in the past, but it still will leave mark; I don't doubt that."

I played it because it is fun! I think Mathmech Sigma was a weird, but a nice inclusion in the deck. It let me do plays that won me games way too many times to cut it. To prepare for the meta I dueled a lot against Mika before this YTC, and attended every online locals, letting me get a feel of the metagame. The 2 loses I got were in swiss, against Anju's amazing Mekk-Knight Dark-stuff deck. Honestly, that matchup was all skill. I just wasn't on par with Anju. The other loss was against Wuh Train in top 8. I had never faced blue-eyes before, so I had no idea what I was doing, but I think next time I might beat him (or at least it will be a closer match). To conclude all of my loses were on me - and not my deck - which I have optimized to hell by now.</span>"

There are 10 starters with shiranui solitaire searching uni-zombie and one for one and e-tele searching psi-reflector. psi reflector is a one-card assault-mode monster and combined with any monster already on the field such as a danger or fraulein can be made into full armor master or crystal wing on the opponent's turn, the latter granting additional draw power. Balerdrach allows assault mode to come out more quickly and assault mode allows balerdrach to banish more often."

This is a very easy to handle, and budget deck for some of those deciding they want to start strong and mighty while also getting into competitive yugioh. This deck is very easy to learn, and plays slightly like Zoodiacs - just not as overpowered and very heavy on the colour theme. So without wasting another second, here's my take on Super Quants - featuring the new support.  I've attempted to make this deck as coherent and consistent as possible: so I've mixed in two small engines to help out the deck so that it can run smoother, and decrease the chances of opening a bad hand. I run as little bricks as possible, with only 3 garnets in the main - and I've maxed out on all the Quantum monsters in order to get as many negates on board and as much synergy as I can get. The first engine I run - is a standard plant engine. I use <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> to get out my <a data-name=""Ophrys Scorpio"">Ophrys Scorpio</a> so that I can start the combo. The second engine of mine is a very compact Danger! engine. I only run five cards, mainly for draw and level three bodies. This also goes hand-in-hand with practically all my Quantum monsters - as they have effects that go off when they're sent to the grave.  The new link monster also helps this deck out quite a few. <a data-name=""Neo Super Quantal Mech King Blaster Magna"">Neo Super Quantal Mech King Blaster Magna</a> allows you to draw a card whenever you special summon an extra deck monster to a zone he points to. This works really well with <a data-name=""Magnacarrier"">Magnacarrier</a>, your ace card of the deck, as you don't lose any cards off of it's discard requirement. Meaning you can set-up a board with three disruptions for no cost so long as you have your field spell on board. This meant that I had to add an <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> in order to summon <a data-name=""Blue Layer"">Blue Layer</a> and get to search. <a data-name=""King Blaster Magna"">King Blaster Magna</a> also brings himself back from the grave once he's destroyed, however you won't have those arrows in place so it will mean you must discard to make optimal negates.  All of the different negates disrupt your opponent in some way. However - you could only do it on your turn unless you use a Super Quant of the right colour as material. <a data-name=""Grampulse"">Grampulse</a> allows you to pop a backrow card of your opponents. This is very good for decks like True Draco that focus on the Spell/Trap zones. <a data-name=""Mech Beast Aeroboros"">Mech Beast Aeroboros</a> is practically a <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> with legs; meaning it can disrupt a potential link play your opponent might make to stop their combo like Isolde, or just to negate an effect of some sort. <a data-name=""Magnaliger"">Magnaliger</a> allows you to pop an opponents <em>monster</em> which comes in handy if they're trying to make a play. This one is one of the more easier ones to summon as you usually have either <a data-name=""Red Layer"">Red Layer</a> or <a data-name=""White Layer"">White Layer</a> on field. Finally, and by far the best one, <a data-name=""Lusterrex"">Lusterrex</a>. This card allows you to simply negate a monsters effect. Its a in-archetype apollousa except for only 1 negate. Either way, all four of these xyz's monsters are really good and with this build, you can usually end on 3 without losing any card advantage.  To be frank, this deck is a nice 5.3/10. It's a pretty mild deck and doesn't require much skill to tackle - which is a blessing in disguise. The cards go for cheap, so its a big win for budget players. The archetype in my opinion is very underrated and deserves more support. Tune in tomorrow because I've got a very interesting decklist as part of my daily upload. Hope you have a great rest of the night, evening, day or morning!"

If you've never played weather painters before, the basic gist of their gimmick is that they use their spells and traps to gain unique effects of which they banish themselves as cost for, then return the following standby phase.  This effect lets them work well with dodging removal effects from the opponent - as well as many good board wipe cards you may use yourself, such as <strong>Dark Hole</strong>, Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, and especially <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>.  The deck primarily functions as a stun deck, with it's primary ""win condition"" being make <strong>Weather Painter Rainbow</strong> to <em>non once-per-turn negate anything </em>and basically prevent your opponent from doing anything.  The deck use of a variety of floodgates that work well within their strategy.  <strong>-Anti-Spell </strong><b>Fragrance</b> works well alongside <strong>Rain Canvas</strong> - since you can bounce back the set spell cards to your opponent's hand, preventing them from activating them.  <strong>-Rivalry of Warlords</strong> also fits well, since all the Painters are Fairies (be careful not activate it prematurely in this build since you do play wind witches/crystal wing tho).  <strong>-Skill Drain</strong> is a Weather Painter <em>staple</em> in all builds is by far the best trap in the deck. It works wonders with painters, since they banish themselves to activate their effects. In short, they still work under the effect of Skill Drain. And if you ever needed it gone for whatever reason, you can send it as cost with Thunder Painter and facilitate it's effect to place another Canvas straight from your deck face up. You play the 1 copy you can right now, but should it ever come off the limited list years from now, immediately bump that ratio up.  -<strong>Imperial Order </strong>is also a good floodgate that is important in freezing out spell heavy decks like Sky Strikers, but it can also turn off your Spell Canvases too so it's kind of a give and take.  Other tech cards that work well with this deck are  -<strong>Pot of Extravagance: </strong>Unfortunately still stupidly expensive, but if you can afford it you should play it. Viable budget backups that can still somewhat work are <strong>Shared Ride</strong> and <strong>Upstart Goblin</strong>. <em>Desires or Duality is not recommended</em>...  -<strong>Kaijus: </strong>Instant removal, but with an added benefit within this archetype. You can tribute over your opponent's monster, then use a Painter monster with <strong>Thunder Canavas</strong>'s effect to bounce that Kaiju back to your hand for repeated usage. Any Kaiju can work, tho I personally prefer Gadarla particularly in this build due to the wind witches restrictions that may come up on occasion.  -<strong>Valhalla Hall of the Fallen:</strong> Instant special summoning for all of your painters. Works incredibly well with Thunder or Aurora and can kick start plays alongside Snow.  -<strong>Drowning Mirror Force:</strong> Given how often Painters banish themselves, it's quite common to deliberately leave yourself open to a direct attack, which works well with Drowning. Good for baiting offensive OTK decks and clearing the board in general, and while I don't prefer main decking it due to being matchup reliant you should always leave some space for it in the side deck.  -<strong>Topologic Bomber Dragon: </strong>Other than Gumblar (cus that's never getting unbanned) all of the Topologic monsters make for excellent alternative boss monsters that the deck can make without too much hassle. <strong>Bomber</strong> <em>basically become a quick play Dark Hole when paired with a painter and Rainbow Canvas</em>. The same goes for <strong>Trisbaena</strong>, tho a bit less regularly since it'll remove your backrow too (which in most cases isn't optimal since the painters gain their effects from their backrow). So if you accidentally banish all of your Rainbows on accident with Extravagance, or your opponent has an established field that needs instant clearing: Bomber is a very good alternative boss monster that is very easy to obtain, play and summon.  -<strong>Leviair the Sea Dragon: </strong>Probably the only Xyz monster worth playing in the deck. Generic Rank 3 that can bring back your banished Painters that aren't able to come back due to getting Ash Blossomed during the standby phase. Can come in clutch if you really need an important Painter back like Aurora for the protection. Not summoned a whole lot, but like a band aid it's good to have around.  &nbsp;  Overall, this deck is pretty fun but also semi-competitive. It's able to go up against most casual decks, and even give the meta a run for their money if you play it right. Good luck, and have fun with em."

Open the curtains of the show. Behold, I present you the ""Orcust Codebreaker"" Deck, using the most newest cards from Eternity Code Booster Box!  The main idea is to send ""Codebreaker Zero Day"" to the Graveyard, or bring it to hand by different ways, using the Orcusts and Goukis to fullfill the field and Summon ""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"" and ""Codebreaker Virus Berserker"" to the field. This will cause the opponent's monsters that are linked to ""Zero Day"" to lose 1000 ATK each if they are not ""Codebreaker"" monsters, and I can destroy up to 3 opponent's Spell / Traps with the effect of the ""Virus Berserker"".  This is a going-second focused Deck, but it can also do very well by going first. If your opponent doesn't use Links, you can only use Codebreaker as a way to fill the field, and to add cards  from the Deck to the hand via ""Codebreaker Day Zero"", while using your monsters to Summon the Orcusts.  You are free to download the Deck and try!  Have fun!"

Combos for the deck are your standard time thief and striker combos but you can make use of Area zero and time thief redoer by targeting it with the effect of area zero to search, then banishing the reoder until the end phase similar to what can be done with Raye.  Your other combos mostly resolve around controlling the board with time thief and using the sky strikers for consistency and rank 4 material and if needed banishing your redoer or destroying one of your rank 4's to use the removal striker offers.  One newer addition is Sky striker ace Sieg, The decks new rank 2. The combo round this is simply to banish one card your opponent controls then if possible get a level 4 on the field then use Sieg's effect to destroy Area zero to special another striker from the main deck to continue xyz plays.  More simple interactions is the potential OTK with utopia double which if it fails due to drawing the one of double or nothing it can be used with area zero for a search. Using Daigusto Emerald to put back your strikers link monsters back into the extra deck which is especially helpful with cards like Kagari and time thief Perpetua or any other xyz or link in general (though these are your main targets).  The side deck has been improved with added disruption and negation such as ways to remove problem monsters in niburu and the kaijus along with some match up based choices such as abyss dweller for Orcust and evilswarm nightmare for combo decks. The rest of the side deck is mostly optional cards or alternatives for the main deck based on preference."

By not only using the Danger! monsters, you can utilize Gizmek Orochi and Stromberg's effect to special summon a Hexe Trude directly from your deck, allowing you access to Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star or the Galaxy Eyes package.  On top of that, you're able to access Gren Maju with much more consistency against it being milled to the banished zone by running an entire Red Resonator engine to easily Synchro summon into Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Horse Prince to summon Gren Maju directly from the deck. You can summon Red Resonator with either Glife the Phantom Bird to pop a spell or trap, or Chaosrider Gustaph to get two free banishes from the GY.  Lastly, Topologic Zeroboros can be brought out easily with all the resources you'd be able to summon. If you able to end with Gizmek Orochi in the GY at that point, you can use Gizmek's effect in the GY at the right time to banish everything on your opponent's side of the field, potentially removing your opponent valuable resources.

I run some pretty spicy techs that disrupt your opponent for pretty much no cost. This is by far one of my fav,"Okay, this is epic. For today's upload, I've managed to make a deck that I could quite gladly call fantastic. This is a deck that I am proud of in the fullest - using new, quirky techs to spice up the decklist and make it even more of an absolute game-ender. I've used the quite popular Zombie Lightsworns, and made them viable again in the new format. Surprisingly, this deck has gotten less popular and strong since the rise of master rule 4, but with the new 2020 revisions this deck has gotten amazingly good - being able to run cards like Jack A' Booran for some crazy disruptions. To start off - this deck is fire! I've managed to end on boards like: Borreload Savage, Hope Harbinger, Balerdroch, Jack A' Booran and Abyss Dweller. This deck mills like crazy, being able to bring out so many negates makes it unreal.  The main monster you want to see in your hand is Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn. This card allows you to mill freely and is also a level 4 tuner, meaning you can access borreload with ease. It's also searchable off of ROTA, so you basically run 4 copies of this card (ignoring the draw power). This deck can also deal a <em>whole </em>lot of damage going second - with the effect of Zombie World making all monsters in either players graveyard zombie type; cards like Shiranui Shogunsaga are a great way to dish out damage to your opponent. With his effect, you can target cards with over 3000 attack and deal just about lethal damage depending on your situation. Jack is also a card that profits off of this effect, as its a re-occurring shark cannon of sorts; allowing you to special summon a monster from <em>either </em>players graveyard.  An impeccable card to play is Super Polymerization. This card combined with your field spell makes <em>all </em>cards a good target for Nethersoul Dragon. This usually leads to scooping, with your opponent setting up big monsters just for them to go to the graveyard and give you a 3k beatstick. In general, there are very little outs aside from backrow removal when zombie world hits the field. I also run a modest Danger! engine, like most of my decks nowadays...It allows you to draw and get more names in the grave, which is good as a lot of cards I run have an ability to plus off that.  With its new release, Arknemesis Eschatos has managed to make an appearance. I run three copies of melody of awakening dragon, allowing me to search him and Levianeer - a card that instantly lets you pop 2 cards from your opponents side of the field.  Over all, this deck is a whopping 9.1/10. I'm pretty confident in saying this might be a very sleeped on deck after July. Once we get our imports from Japan, this deck will be a force. This is one of my best decks yet, in my opinion, and has immense potential. It's its own thing and I can respect that - being able to create unbreakable boards with fun and original cards. I hope you'll fall in love with it as much as me!"

Eh its built in a way to always have everything, if you look closely there are 2 removal cards (exciton, castel, Crpcp). There are many stun optioms including 2 R4sEvolzars and Dweller (which is key because he can detach), Draw 1 is just worth it, specially because Dinosaurs can function perfectly fine without an extra deck, trading it for a draw is worth it, very few decks can afford ruining their extra with extrava.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> - This card being any of the 2 fieldspells makes it better then each</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a> -  yes</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Ultra Evolution"">Ultra Evolution</a> - 2 is correct because you can &gt; Evolution &gt; Quatlus &gt; Evolution &gt; UTC across 2 turns. the card doesn't have to hard condition. also with there being 2 searchers for this card you always wanna be able to search the one for next turn if you draw it (which is fine 2nd one can wait). Hard drawing it is also fine, I know many people dont know the ratios of Pill stuff, Run 2 Pills, 1 argo and 1 Quatlus and you ll have a perfect ratio.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Set rotation"">Set rotation</a> - This card being any of the 2 fieldspells makes it better then each, Also random mystic mine out.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a> - In testing realised 3 could possibly brick, there are just more ways of popping babies.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lost world"">Lost world</a> - this is not just a going second card since ovi / pankratops can pop the tokens turn 1.

Won't be around for long but still - a good deck in it's own right, and definitely rewarding once you p","Okay, this deck is simple. Like most Extralink decks currently in yugioh, it revolves around summoning a heck-ton of monsters and linking away to ultimately stop your opponent from using their extra monster zone, which in master rule 4 is a very, <em>very</em> important. So without hesitation: i'll explain all you need to know about this deck, and how to reach its amazing endboard.  I guess the main focus of this deck is to, obviously, a) stop your opponent from using zones and b) pitching spyral mission cards. You do this mainly using the discard effects of cards you play such as Card Destruction or the dangers, but your main play is to Master Plan. With the new Dark Magician level 1 monster, spyrals have gotten in-direct support. Not only can you recycle two spells/traps from your hand - which ties in with the spyral traps - but also get a free body on field as well as ditch master plan to the grave. This is amazing, as with a plethora of spell cards this card becomes easily searchable - notably the card Where Arf Thou.  The second big monster you want to see - spyral quik-fix along with spyral drones. You can special summon these monsters using one for one and, again, search them off where arf thou as your normal summon - once your souls combo has resolved. The dark warrior/malicious engine is in there, mainly for added consistency, but the deck would do just fine without it. So what's the ideal end board?  The main endboard you'd hope to achieve is one that your opponent has quite little chance of breaking through. You obviously want to have double helix in your first extra monster zone as he is the main combo starter. Then you would want to resolve a 3-card Tri-Gate. You'd special summon him just below helix, &amp; the way you'd do this is by having a Knightmare Phoenix on his left, and Ib on his right. The reason I run Ib over a popular card like Proxy Dragon, is due to the fact that you can summon it without really trying - and it has the additional protection from battle and card effects. Then right next to it you run a Knightmare Cerberus, for obvious reasons - and a Linkuriboh right above it, for extra battle disruption.  Overall, I'd give this deck a solid 7.8/10. It fails to handtraps a lot, meaning you want to open Called as much as possible. Along with that: there's also the possibility of bricking, which happens rarely - but when it does, you're basically better off playing game 2 and 3. Still it's a fun deck to play and very rewarding once you pull it off - locking your opponent out from zones is, in my opinion, better than setting up a board of negates. I'll definitely be trying to do more master rule 4 decks before April brutally murders me, and I'll try to make a quirky lock out deck as well, so look out for that. Comment some deck ideas down below, I'd love to hear what you guys have to offer!"

This banished-based archetype allows you to not only plus, but to get some extra negates on field if you play your cards right; so with that being said, let me explain why this archetype is so good, and what can it do.  First of all, let me just state that this is a splash archetype. I do not see this doing well on its own - it has a nice gimmick and all don't get me wrong, but just not enough cards or good effects to make it worthwhile playing this set of cards by themselves. However: cards like Nemesis Corridor still do have worthwhile effects. You can shuffle back a banished card, like it states, and then use it as fodder for colossus. It's a really cool play, as it allows you to extend and put a restriction on your opponent. Corridor is also available as a target for Raidjin, another disruption. I won't necessarily bother explaining the Invoked combos - as I've covered them in the past.  I run the Striker engine for consistency, and it does the job pretty well. One thing I would want to mention is Protos - it's a decent card and enables targets for your nemesis monsters, but you'd usually side it out game 2 and 3. It's also a nice beatstick when it comes to it, but usually you manage to make a pretty decent control board. Also, when showing the deck to my friend I'd had come to mind that I should most likely clarify: Secure Gardna is the target for Mechaba - just to put it out there.  In the end: this deck deserves a good 8/10. It's nice, and definitely uses the nemesis archetype nicely. Over all, not the best iteration of Invoked, but hopefully you enjoy it and have fun playing the archetype."

Discard and special summon out the arse.  Win game?  Profit. ,"Papa's got a brand new bag (except not really). &gt;:D Ok, so in all honesty, this deck is my personal pet project. Has been for a couple years now, basically since the Danger! stuff came out. I sincerely believe the Dangers! can be good all on their own with just a few cards to help them along. No extra engine per se (except my 2 card Dark World Grapha Recycling Service, you can pry that from my cold, dead hands), just a lot of nice cards that play well with the discard-centric mechanics of the deck.  The primary goal is still predominantly the same, except now the deck also has no issue going first, but it's ability to dismantle bigger negate-happy boards relies more on destroy effects than it does... well.. Lava Golem. I mean, it's still there, in the side, since we don't need our normal summons if we side out Vainty's Ruler, but it's not center stage anymore, as it has been in previous iterations. No, instead we welcome two new players to the game; The Fabled Good Boi and Infinite Impermanence! Why? Because Cerburrel isn't once per turn, making him basically another Tsuchinoko to this deck (I.E. good for links and/or tribute summons) and for that unique flavor of removal that is Brionac, and because this deck loses hard, and I mean HARD, to Abyss Dweller. So we run a hand trap that can be used turn 1, or we can at least hope to see it in our opening hand going second. If you don't have Infinite Impermanence, you're probably a sane individual with more reasonable and/or varied hobbies, and you can use PSY-Frame Gamma for the same kind of protection. I opted for the trap because it's got more utility (especially going first or after turn 1) and because it requires only 3 spots instead of 4. Also I hate myself and am a connoisseur of poor life choices.  Going first for the deck, comparatively, is actually a bit of a better time than trying to break really big and obnoxious boards. It's a good time when you can end on a board like, say, Vanity's Ruler, I:P and Lancelot (so as you can negate any nasty Evenly Matched activation as well) and maybe a fodder card, for a Knightmare Unicorn response, but it's also very realistic with a bit of luck. Just remember that, if it's at all possible, your 5th summon should be either Vanity's or Azathot to make sure you don't get Nibiru'd to nothin' but nubs.  On to the extra deck! This is your main toolbox. Anything that can't be popped has to be dealt with from here. Fortunately, between the two Link 4's and Unicorn, you do have a fair few options in that regard, and as long as you've got a bit of luck with your random discards, link fodder is no object. And generally speaking, anything Soldier of Chaos can't deal with, Borreload can.  That's about it, really. I think each step I take with this deck is really only a half-step forward in most cases, but progress is progress. I'll be taking this to a Regional event this weekend, so I can see how it does and maybe do another update with what I learn. This entire description and deck list is mostly for my benefit (as I enjoy keeping a log of not only deck lists but also previous versions of this deck for posterity), but if anybody who deigns to read this has any comments, criticisms or fun words of encouragement, feel all kinds of welcome to speak up. :)  Cheers! And happy new years!"

Updated for the New Master Rule.,"This deck is the best that it's ever been. With new support (direct and indirect) and Master Rule 5 coming up, this deck can go off with the full Ritual Beast Combo (3 Searches + Floating) or place down an indestructible Crystal Wing + some disruption as a backup plan. The deck has always struggled with consistency, but it can now do something more than -Summon a monster and pray- most of the time. Wynn allows you to search all of your Beasts (except Winda and Lara) or the Wind Witches or even Droll and Lock if you've already got the combo while dumping beasts in the grave to extend. I've been playing Ritual Beasts off and on since they were released and am very satisfied with this list.  &nbsp;  A couple of things you should be aware of:  -The Wind Witches: They lock you out of summoning level 5 or lower Wind Monsters, so if you have Elder+Cannahawk/Pengu or like combo, don't use them. They are for the hands when you can't go off with RB's.  -The Dragon Ruler is to get dead Ritual Beasts out of your grave.  -For Experienced RB players: The Research Lab/Zefra Field spell thing was...neat, but with the limiting of Terra it's just not worth it anymore. Feel free to playtest it and tell me if it's any more consistent, but I don't think it is.  -For Players new to Ritual Beasts: This deck can be deceptively complex. I recommend finding some tutorials online. If you don't know, you can use Ulti-Cannahawks First Effect, then chain his second effect and summon back one of your targets. As long as one makes it to the grave, the search effect still resolves. Opening Elder + Cannahawk/Pengu should net you 3 searches or 2 Searches plus an ideal board (4 RB's + 2 Steeds). Also note that Ulti-Apelio is uneffected by everything when she attacks, so any attack boost it got is shut off (it's annoying). Just remember, practice makes perfect. YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. The deck is VERY rewarding to learn and get better at.  &nbsp;  I've had a love for this deck for a while. I love the art, the cards, and the unique deck playstyle.  Feel free to leave comments and suggestions in the comments.  -  &nbsp;"

This new monster allows you to instantly open into the ideal e,"First off, why? I have never used broken to describe a deck on my daily uploads: but what other deck can we call broken if not this one?!  Konami have done the outstanding move of giving an archetype that's already broken - even more disgustingly amazing support. Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu is by far the most fantastic Orcust card. It can work as an combo starter, and extender - and instantly allows you to start up your combo's with a token on board. The list I've made is a rather simple one - focusing on getting the Striker Orcust endboard as fast as possible: which happens nine times out of ten. But there are some insane combos you can make - seeing as though it is both a Mekk-Knight card and becomes a level 4 tuner, which enables ib like never before.  An optimal engine you might want to play is also Scrap. The main reason I cut it was primarily because of Girsu's effect - doing the same if not more, and with the fact that Golem acted as a garnet which somehow I opened way too much! Still the ammount of monsters you normal summon reduces, but if you want to add it I'd recommend cutting the Zerovoros in extra, Mathematician and Phantazmay in main.  An end board you might want to make is most likely Longirsu, Dingirsu, Cresendo and Babel with 1-2 orcust monsters in grave and a Gizmek orochi. With the new support, this practically isnt a challenge - so open well and your opponent might as well scoop. The second board you could make is I:P, babel and some monsters in grave. This instantly opens a way to nuke your opponents board with Zerovoros, and will usually end to passing back to you, and you getting 4K beatstick and your opponent being wide open. Which if you open another combo opener, could lead to a potential OTK.  Overall: this deck deserves no lower than 9.8/10. Orcust are one of the most meta-defying engines out there, making top cut almost every YCS and Regional there is. With this new support: Konami have shown that this deck will not die, and continue to crush people one-by-one like bugs. As much as we hate this deck: It is one - if not - <em>the </em>best deck in the meta. There is no deck at this moment that can rise up to it, and I'm not surprised why. It has yet to have its fall from grace - despite everyone wanting it to. Can't wait to see this deck rise up to Tier 0 alongside Dragon Rulers and TeleDAD. Konami have made a big mistake..."

Bring on Eternity Code!","Let me just start by saying Eternity Code and Master Rule 5 excites me more than a 5 year old in a toy store. Dusting off the ol' Dinosaur deck ready for April 1st, I've been playing around with different strategies for the deck. An example of this is the new Jewel Beast - Argosaurus. That bad boy is a 1.5 card combo to end on a Linkuriboh, a Rank 4 of your choosing, and either an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno OR Overtex Qoatlus. However, the main combo for this deck involves Ultimaya Tzolkin. Sounds insane right? But thanks to Master Rule 5, it is not only possible, it is the nuts. Ending on a board of Apollousa, a Level 7/8 Dragon Synchro, and either Ultimate Conductor Tyranno OR Overtex Qoatlus is nothing to laugh at. You can further extend this with a Naturia Beast if you have access to Giant Rex. Would I consider this Meta-Breaking? No. But it sure can be difficult for most decks to get around with the buff to Dimensional Barrier.  I will be happy to explain how this combo works if people ask for it."

So the Sky Striker Engine is usefull to add consistancy by generating draw power, CA and enabling more gameplans if we are forced to go second.  The Psy-Frame monsters works as hand traps, they respond to particular actions to special summon themselves from the hand and special summon a Psy-Frame Driver from the hand/deck/graveyard to negate an effect or an attack and destroy the card (Psy-Framegear Alpha being the exception with it's tuto effect). The two monsters will be banished at the end phase if they remain on the field, and you can only activate this effect if you control no monsters. Psy-Framelord Lambda and Psy-Frame Circuit are the most important cards of the deck, the first bypassing the conditions of activation of the Psy-Framegear monsters and the second consisting on a rapid synchro summon using the two summoned monsters (there are 2 Psy-Framelord synchro monnsters that banishes themselves until the next standby phase to trigger their effect so you control no monsters anymore and can continue to resolve your Psy-Framegear monster effects from your hand even without controlling a Psy-Framelord Lambda). Psy-Framegear's effects can be stopped by Ash Blossom so be sure to use them at the good timings, but since they don't have others activation restrictions and will remain in your hand, you will be able to use them again immediatly.  &nbsp;  The monster engine is built to countain the Psy-framegear that will be usefull in the most cases before siding, so we have 3 Psy-Framegear Alpha to respond to an opponent's summon and tuto, 1 Psy-Framegear Beta to negate an attack and destroy the attacking monster, 3 Psy-Framegear Delta to negate and destroy a spell, and 3 Psy-Framegear Gamma to negate a monster effect and destroy it. Psy-Framegear Epsilon isn't main decked because being able to respond to trap cards is mathematically more specific, so we'll side it to optimize the consistancy. 2 Psy-Frame Driver are enough to avoid bricks when enabling the deck to work even after banishing disruption effect. Blackwing - Steam The Cloak is a one card combo to gain access to Psy-Framelord Lambda : normal summon Cloak then link summon Salamangreat Almiraj to create a token that you'll tribute to summon Cloak from the graveyard, then link summon Psy-Framelord Lambda and use the newly created token to bring out a Linkuriboh and gain a little protection effect for your Psy-Framelord Lambda. Lastly Ash Blossom will slow down the opponent to handle it's boards more easily when starting second, and will back up the Psy-Frame monsters to prevent your opponent to come back by locking a tuto/specific summon effect.  The spell engine countains of course Psy-Frame Circuit, and Sky Striker cards with some generic draw/back up. Psy-Frame Circuit allows instant synchro fusion when a Psy-Framegear's effect resolves, enabling synchro 7 and 8 summons during the opponent's turn since all Psy-Framegear are level 1 and 2 tuners, and sports a battle effect that discards a Psy-Frame monster to boost a Psy-Frame monster you control by the attack of the discarded monster (your monsters will be able to peak at 4000/5000 atk so you can bypass some specific beatsticks or protect yourself). The Sky Striker engine countains Engage to search other pieces of the engine and draw, Hornet Drones to create a token and summon Kagari that will recycle Sky Striker spells, Aterburner to destroy a monster then a backrow card, Widow Anchor to negate a monster's effect and steal it and Shark Cannon to banish a monster from the graveyard or take control of it. Note that if you have to be aggressive you can use the stolen monsters with Widow Anchor/Shark Cannon to rapidly summon a Borrelsword Dragon. Lastly we use Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero because it can send a Psy-Frame Overload to the graveyard if we have one in the opening hand when being able to search a Sky Striker spell, it's equally a neutral target for Set Rotation. Terraforming and Set Rotation are field searchers to get access to your Psy-Frame Circuit, Set Rotation is good combined with Sky Striker Airspace since it won't give benefic effects to your opponent in most cases and can bring out Mystic Mine in some situations. Mystic Mine is a great card to temporize the game if we have a mediocre hand and is also an option to open the game if we go second so we can force out a negate or be safe to make our loops without being interrupted by monster effects. Lastly Foolish Burial Goods send Psy-Frame Overload to the graveyard from the deck and Upstart Goblin and One Day Of Peace are good neutral draw cards that litterally say that we play at 38 cards.  We run only 3 trap cards, one Metaverse to directly seet a field spell from the deck so we have Psy-Frame Circuit or Mystic Mine during the opponent's turn, and 2 Psy-Frame Overload that can banish cards on the field and overall banish itself from the graveyard to tuto any other Psy-frame card. Note that Psy-Frame Overload can be chained to your other effects to protect yourself from some disruptive plays.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is composed of level 7 and 8 synchro monsters that directly help the control gameplan of the deck and a little Link monsters base to concretise boards. First we have Salamangreat Almiraj and Linkuriboh that pairs with the Blackwing - Steam The Cloak combo. Psy-Framelord Lambda allows your Psy-Framegear's effects to resolve even if you control monsters, and tuto any Psy-frame card when one of your Psy-Frame monsters banishes itself (even if he leaves the field). Lastly Borrelsword Dragon is a way to go for aggressive plays/finishers in pair with Widow Anchor and Shark Cannon to use the opponent's ressources.  The synchro monsters first countains Psy-Framelord Zeta and Psy-framelord Omega, level 7 and 8 monsters that can banish themselves to respectively banish an opponent's special summoned attack position monster and a random opponent's card from his hand until the next stanby phase. Zeta can also return from the graveyard to the extra deck to recycle a Psy-Frame monster. Omega can return from the graveyard to the extra deck to return any card from the graveyard to the deck so you can recycle specific monsters, and can return a banished card to it's owner's graveyard during the opponent's stanby phase so you can recycle your Psy-Frame Overload to gain extra tutos. The fact your synchro Psy-Framelords banish themselves means you won't contrl monsters anymore so even if you didn't summoned Psy-Framelord Lambda you will be able to use other Psy-Framegear effects, and when returning to your field they won't use your extra monster zones anymore. F.A. Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage Dragon are a spell/trap negate and a negate all that will back up the Psy-Frame monsters or finish a board if you Don't control Psy-Frame Lambda. Black Rose Moonlight Dragon can bounce monsters to disrupt boards by directly cuting ressources, being a good weapon against fusion and synchro focused decks. Black Rose Moonlight Dragon is a great way to wipe entire boards, mainly if your opponent mostly his backrow. Finally Dragon Ogre Deity Of Tenyi is a good weapon against combo decks that will banish monsters and extenders to prevent comebacks, it can also attack two times in a row on special summoned monsters to add a little offensive power to the deck.  &nbsp;  Now the side deck. It's mainly designed for going second games since we want to go first to set the field for our Psy-Frames to operate.  Twin Twisters can destroy up to 2 backrow cards when potentially discard cards like Psy-Frame Overload, to have a better match up against decks using consistant backrow that could be annoying. Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves is also a searchable card that can destroy 1 backrow card plus 1 monster.  Dark Ruler No More will neutralize combo deck's boards and let you free to set up your board.  Artifact Lancea is a must have that notably stop Orcusts as well as Thunder Dragons.  Psy-Framegear Epsilon is a card to add to countain decks using traps, and is also a good way to handle the most Dangerous floodgates against decks like True Draco.  Stardust Dragon is a specific tech against True Draco that is a hard match up with it's floodgates and backrow that destroy our cards when sent in the graveyard, it has the advantage to stop True Draco's backrow secondary effects and counter Diagram.

This deck draws a fine line between versatility and splashability","Hello! I'd like to apologize for the recent inactivity. I am currently resolving some issues IRL which I don't feel comfortable sharing - but I'll do my best to keep dishing out these awesome decks. I might not be able to upload daily however - so I've set myself a target of a new deck every other day. So with that out of the way, here's the card list.  Adamatia is a strong, independent archetype that archetype that focuses on...nothing? The reason this deck appeals to me a lot - not taking in to account that rocks finally have good support - is it's versatility and the ability to change playstyle on command. It is a synchro based deck that focuses on bringing out tuners, and searching/stacking your deck. I, of course, have decided to make a more-or-less negate heavy strategy: out of impulse of course. Due to them being rock monsters, Block Dragon works surprisingly well in this deck - thats why I run a 6 card engine. The main concept is to use level 4's like Gigantes or one of the eggs - to make Naturia Beast. What's great about this deck, is you most likely will always manage to find a way of summoning it. Instant fusion also helps out - making the level 3 earth attribute fusionist.  A really good tech card that works well with this deck - is Muddy Mudragon. Since it's a level 6, you can make this card at literally anytime due to the Adamatia monsters - with this, you can use cards like Destrudo and use its built in polymerization effect - making Dragun of Red-Eyes. That plus Naturia Beast and some disruptions with the Adamatia synchros and you've got a near unbreakable board.  In conclusion: I'd give this deck a solid 8.2/10. I really like the fact you can play this deck in so many different ways - using cards like Block Dragon to your advantage, and even playing it pure. In my opinion, it deserves all the hype its getting - and will definitely be a fan-favourite after April's new change. Great deck - hopefully konami puts out more bangers!"

The Nemesis engine adds extenders to go for powerfull control monsters like Apollousa and countains an easy to summon boss monster that can lock the special summons of an attribute (mainly we'll choose dark attribute monsters) for the upcoming opponent's turn or wipe boards following our starting position  The Thunder Dragon package is classical, we have Dragonroar to special summon from the deck/recycle cards, Dragonmatrix to tuto other copies and boost monsters when having a normal summon, Dragondark to tuto other copies and tuto cards, Dragonhawk to resurrect monsters and cycle the hand, and Dragonduo to banish cards from the deck and tuto when having an easy to summon beatstick.  The Danger package generates consistant summons to go for great link monsters like Borrelsword Dragon and Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess when making the xyz 4 and xyz 8 summons easier. They also allows us to get rid of Batteryman Solar that was mainly used as a starter to open Dragonhawk plays and link summons and consumes the normal summon. A Danger monster is a good last play to generate a free target for Archnemesis Protos effect when starting first.  The Nemesis monsters special summon themselves by sending back any banished monster to the deck so you can recycle key cards and spam the board, they are also supplementary types and attributes that enables the summon of Archnemesis monsters to trigger powerfull wipe board/floodgate-like effects. Nemesis Umbrella can recycle Nemesis monsters send to the graveyard by Danger monsters or as materials for extra deck summons, Nemesis Flag tuto Nemesis cards and Nemesis Corridor can recycle banished Nemesis monsters, notably being a one card Thunder Colossus combo and a free trigger for Thunder Dragon Titan's effet. Archnemesis Protos is easy to summon and a good way to pressure opponent's board by destroying all monsters of a chosen attribute and preventing their special summon untill the end of the opponent's turn (basically when gong first we choose Dark that is the most popular attribute in Yu-Gi-Oh! and won't threaten our board since Thunder Dragon Protos will protect itself from destruction)  Aloof Lupine is a great starter that can banish 1 Thunder Dragon from our hand and 1 from our deck so we can trigger 2 effects and have 2 free targets for the summon of low level Nemesis monsters. It's also a free target for xyz4 summons to finamize boards.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer and Destrudo, The Dead Drake of Dread are two good extenders. The first opens easy xyz 8 summons when being a good option to cut 1 card of the opponent's hand when starting first or destroy 2 opponent's card when starting second, and the second is a free synchro 7 summon.  &nbsp;  The spell package is restrained to maximise monster's interactions, we simply use Allure Of Darkness to draw and abuse of it's banishing cost to activate Thunder Dragondark and Dragonroar's effect to have a direct starter and a +2 CA with a direct target for Nemesis monsters. Gold Sarcophagus directly banishes a monster from the deck to start any loop. Thunder Dragon Fusion is a searchable way to summon Thunder Dragon Colossus and recycle ressources when having a direct way to grind the gae for the next turn if there is any. Lastly Monster Reborn is a way to search out specific Thunder Dragon monsters discarded by Danger monsters to use their effects and have an extender that will allow a specific extra deck summon.  &nbsp;  The main extra deck monsters are Thunder Dragon Colossus and Thunder Dragon Titan. Colossus prevents the opponent to use tuto effects and can survive destruction anytime you want since you can banish a thunder monster, it Simply summons itself by tributing a thunder monster after you used a thunder monster effect from your hand (Nemesis Corridor is a one card Colossus since it activates it's effect from the hand to special summon itself, being thunder type). It's level 8 and easy summon conditions, specially in Master Rule 5 format, makes it a direct extender to summon xyz 8 monsters. Titan is a 3200 atk beatstick that can destroy a card without targetting it each time a thunder dragon monster is activated from the hand, meaning you can bypass threats like Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax pretty easily, and sports a protection against destruction by effect with a simple cost of banishing any 2 cards from the graveyard. Note that Thunder Dragonmatrix and Dragondark's hand effect are quick effects, so you can use them to destroy cards during your opponent's turn.  The xyz package countains good control monsters and a great extender. First Number 60 : Dugares, The Timeless can notably draw 2 cards and discard 1 to have a +2 CA if discarding a Danger monster and is a Fire attribute that opens plays on Archnemesis Protos. Evilswarm Nightmare can face down a monster that is special summoned up to 2 times in a row so you can pressure the opponent's extra deck summons, Abyss Dweller lock the opponent's graveyard and Number 38 : Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy is a spell negate that can redirect attacks to protect other monsters in specific configurations.  The only synchro monster is F.A. Dawn Dragster, a spell/trap negate that is free to summon with Destrudo's effect . A summon using Thunder Dragon monsters generates CA by sending them to the grave, meaning a free synchro summon in terms of rentability.  Lastly the Link package countains Knightmare Phoenix and Knightmare Unicorn to handle the opponent's board, mainly backrow, when going second. Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess is a multi monster effect negate and Borrelsword Dragon is a good OTK generator that is a safe gameplan if we open a fair number of Danger monsters.  &nbsp;  Now, the extra deck. This deck likes to open first, so the main siding options are designed to play second.  Twin Twisters, Red Reboot and Imperial Order are great options to handle the backrow focused deck. The first destroys up to 2 backrow cards and is free if discarding a danger monster, the second prevent a trap from activating and completely shut down decks like Altergeist and Subterror, also harming True Draco and Salamagreat strategies, and the third is a radical answer to Pendulum and Sky Striker when being a way to shut down numerous extenders and searchers of other decks.  Nibiru, The Primal Being breaks going first combo decks by tributing all it's monsters and summoning 1 token to replace them, be aware to use it at the good timing since cards like Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess can negate it's effect.  Borreload Dragon is a monster with pretty good built-in protection effect that can bypass the most resilient beatsticks surviving destruction effects.  The Melody Of Awakening Dragon and Archnemesis Eschatos works hand in hand, the first is a spell that tuto the second and can also search a Chaos Dragon Levianeer in addition to Eschatos. Archnemesis Eschatos is a solid answer to type focused decks like Salamangreat and Orcust, and is evenly good against Dargonlink, mirror matches and other decks by enabling OTKs or locking down the opponent Following the match up and our starting position."

I have done about three days of playtesting with different variants and this is the one I decided to upload. I think this deck has one major issue and that is the attribute restriction. Currently, the deck has one huge restriction and no real way to make it worth it. Whitebeard forces you to only summon in archetype monsters and you need him to make the link monster really useful. Any two monsters including a patroll monster make the link and then you want to have another plunder on the field so that you don't have to equip the link. Then only having three attributes available doesn't really let you make usage of your cards.  So I play two kaijus to try to supplement this. Dogaran and Gameciel are fire and water respectively so you can summon the less common attributes easier. You can cheat these out if you have IKS or if you summon the dark world monster to your opponent's field.  So far I've had a lot of fun with this deck and I will continue to try to improve it for those who are looking. I was surprised that many other people didn't upload variants of this deck. I assume that is because it is a strange archetype and it's hard to find supplemental cards. Try to keep a plunder patroll card in hand during your turn so that you can use the effects of the boats cause often you use all your resources on your first turn. The field spell is the best way to put one back in your hand then discard it for its effect, but this is still not very reliable.  Have fun and please leave comments below as to my ratios. More kaijus, less kaijus, more dangers, play toad...whatever you can think of I would love to hear it."

","The goal of this deck is to banish as many of your opponents cards as possible before summoning Angel of Zera in order to get his attack up. Buten is great to make summoning him easier considering he is a fairly high cost synchro. Once he is on the field that is when it is best to activate a dimensional fissure so that if he is somehow destroyed, he has an almost surefire way of returning via his effect. Tualatin is also a great card to disable certain single type type decks from even functioning, making it even easier to win quickly."

This deck's strategy is to burn away the opponents life points quickly and make sure Uria is well fed. With Emergency provisions and magic planter in there, it helps for activating and swiftly getting rid of Continuous Traps to feed Uria's attack stat. I also added Thestalos the Mega Monarch too as secondary option to help the process of burning the opponent's cards and life points quickly. With this being a purely fire based deck, it makes his effect even more potent."

Fresh strong first turn board wit","<a href=""https://youtu.be/_s0XaT5czYg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/_s0XaT5czYg</a>  Fan favorite Generaider forged with Orcust and World Legacy making it competitive, fun, and fresh with new gameplan and interaction. Best card is Girsu, not only it can start your full combo, it is an Orcust piece too which means very useful in the grind game. I will explain full Lib combo with Girsu (1 card combo).  For the Lib combo, you normal summon Girsu, dump World Armor, activate Girsu ss token, link off token for Linkuriboh, ss Lib (using Linkuriboh, important), activate Lib search Succession, activate Succession ss World Armor, activate World Armor add Monsrtosity, link Lib off for Linkross, activate Linkross (chain Lib if you want to spin opponent's card) ss 2 tokens, ss Linkuriboh from GY using token, ss fusion Trishula (using token, Linkuriboh, and World Armor), activate Monstrosity (ss 2 lv9 from deck or 1 lv9 from hand) ss Mardel and Dovelgus, activate Mardel add Genereaider Boss Stage, activate Dovelgus ss Orcust from hand, overlay 2 lv9 for True King of All Calamities, and proceed with your Orcust combo (using Linkross and Orcust you just ss before).  The Orcust combo ceiling is low without Harp (basically revolves around Orcust Knightmare, dump Wand, activate Wand ss Knightmare from banished pile; Brass ss Orcust from hand; Cymbal ss Orcust from GY), so dont expect much. During opponent's draw phase, Stage can be activated in response to opponent's normal draw, ss Hoarr along with Generaider tokens (fodder for Hoarr or I:P).  Card synergies: Hoarr (dark for Allure, lv9 for Monstrosity), Mardel (searches Stage, lv9), Dovelgus (ss Orcust from hand, lv9), 2 Wand + 2 World Armor (just in case it's drawn, combo pieces, World Legacy fodder for Orcustrated Return, dark for Allure, dumped Wand can ss Armor from hand), 1 Cymbal, 1 Brass (if Cymbal is drawn, you can dump this and ss Cymbal from hand, essentially acting like a second Cymbal while can summon other Orcust from hand too), and the staples like handtraps + s/t removal + generic draw cards.  Extra deck: Combo pieces (including Orcust), I:P + Topologic/Knightmare (can be used with Generaider tokens), and other rank 9 target (Enterblathnir or Infinitrack). It is hard to make Borrelsword, so you can replace it with other generic if you want.  Side deck: Matchup specific.  Cards to think of: Scrap combo (good one, but needs more space and we already choose Lib combo), Unchained Abomination (or all other great I:P target; extra deck is too tight, you have to replace something to include this, applies to other generic extra deck monsters too), Gizmek Orochi (resource is important, so the banishing cost is too big of price to pay; can be played depends on you), your suggestion cards go here.  Full combo replay: <a>http://bit.ly/2RsM1U8</a>  Expected 1st turn: (with Crescendo set)<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/CTsShRR.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Great first turn board, possible disruptions (I:P to Unicorn or Topologic), possible negations (Crescendo, True King of All Calamities, Hoarr), Orcust recursion and protection, big bodies, sometimes can play through handtraps, lots of handtraps for going second, and easy OTK.  Cons: Board can be shut down using strong cards like Super Poly etc (but Calamities effect will still linger even after being outed, so another pros), drawing the lv9 Generaider sucks sometimes.  PS: Shoutout to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/vz6ldDKyOnM"">Lithium2300</a> for the Lib combo."

Since Anubis didn't play a full deck, i used cards that fit his theme since he was essentially the Egyptian lord of the dead, mummies &amp; Zombies were his main theme that i feel represented his character perfectly.

Send Cyber Dragon Nova, which will let you special summon from the extra deck, which will trigger Ryu Okami's effect again, etc.  <strong>Main Combo</strong>  You will need the following: <ul>  	<li>Ryu Okami in your GY</li>  	<li>Give And Take Set on the field</li>  	<li>Photon Sanctuary in your hand</li> </ul> First activate Photon Santuary which gives you 2 tokens. Than activate Give and Take which will special summon the Ryu Okami in your GY to your opponent's field. It will also change the level of one of your tokens but that doesn't matter. Link away your tokens and make Hip Hoshiningen. This will trigger Ryu Okami's effect allowing you to send Cyber Dragon Nova to your GY which will allow you to special summon Cyber End Dragon which will trigger Ryu Okami again and again. You can summon up to 3 Cyber End Dragons, but the third one will also trigger Ryu Okami. At this point you have 2 more options: <ul>  	<li>If you have Felgrand in grave, you can send Prank-Kids Battle Butler to grave which will special summon felgrand.</li>  	<li>You can send Elder Entity N'tss which can destroy a card on the field when sent to your GY.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

So I decided to take a look at Alte,"So uh...orcust is gone. The new January 2020 banlist was surprisingly announced yesterday and, my god did Konami slaughter the meta! So with a brand new meta forming and a whole format before us, I thought I'd take a look at a deck thats been here since the start of master rule 4. Altergeist is another one of those backrow-centered decks that revolve around telling your opponent 'No'. It's main purpose is to get multiple disruptions on board through traps and altergeist monsters &amp;, with its new support, use link monsters to its advantage and slowly peck at your opponent until they die. So with that gruesome explanation, here's my Altergeist build.  To start, this deck is strong. And I mean - <em>really </em>strong. While play-testing I managed to go 9-0 with this deck, facing everything from Orcust to SPYRAL. This deck can search out Multifaker with ease, using cards like: Meluseek, Hexstia, Spoofing and more. You mainly only want to go into either Linkuriboh, Almiraj or Hexstia in the extra - however all the other cards are also good and work well in certain situations. Unlike a lot of builds, I do not run Kidolga. I think it's not that useful and there are other optimal cards you could play, especially when maining Pot of Extravagance.  Since the new banlist kinda killed the whole format - I sided in cards based on previous match-ups. I'd definitely recommend siding at least two copies of Imperial Iron Wall and a playset of Secret Village - for the added degeneracy. Other than that; Lancea and Evenly Matched are my only other recommendations. The rest could just be filler, like an extra copy of Knightmare Phoenix or an Abyss Dweller that you'll probably never make.  My build can also use chain-blocking to its advantage: let's say you opened a Meluseek and a Pookuery. You normal the Seek and link it away using Pook's effect; making Hexstia. Then, search a Multifaker with Seek, and chainblock it with Pookuery. That way you have a free spin during your opponents turn. After that - Link away Hexstia into Linkross, and bam! You have another search for an Altergeist trap plus two tokens for next turn.  Overall; this deck is a hard 9.3/10. Going first you'll <em>always </em>win game 1. You can end on so many disruptions and - even when they break your board - still manage to plus 2 and possibly kill your opponent. The only minor downfall is game 2 or 3 - but if you know your match-up then simply siding in some cards will end your opponent quickly. This is definitely a deck I'm considering for the new format - and I'd recommend it to players experienced with the game, or even just starting!"
