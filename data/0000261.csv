In case you didn't already know, Fallen of Albaz is, hands down, my favorite card in all of YU-GI-OH!. So how could I come join this community (I only just joined yesterday) without showing you all the deck I love most? The answer is I couldn't! And so now all of you get to view my very own creation:  Albaz Despia Dogmatika.  Not only do I love Albaz, I also get a good groove playing it's partners-in-lore: Despia and Dogmatika. Yes, you heard me right: Albaz is a story that plays out in the cards, a card lore. Search on youtube.com 'Albaz lore' to learn more!  Anyway, about the deck. My baby is based off of the very lore of Albaz, but that does not mean I didn't think that Despia and Dogmatika were actually good achetypes to partner Albaz, though some of you might think it a terrible idea to play Dogmatika with a deck whose main win condition is it's Extra Deck. Well, for those who think that look at this way: Not only does the deck prevail in Extra Deck plays, but it also has an engine which can counter the very familiar meta decks that use it. And, please, notice that you <em>can</em>, if need be (which, tbh, need probably will be), replace the Dogmatika cards with those from the ever helpful Side Deck. You don't have to use Dogmatika; it's just there if you wish to. And now about the deck.  You'll notice that the deck is OCG, even though I myself only have ever played the TCG. That's because in this profile I wanted to include the new cards that are getting released in <em>Structure Deck: Albaz Strike</em>, which is coming out on April 8th. Other then those cards, all the other cards are available in the TCG, so once <em>Albaz Strike</em> is released and <strong>Tri-Brigade Mercourier, Springans Kitt, Unlikely Swordsoul Allies, Paradise Branded, Branded Fusion, Branded Condemnation, Branded Blade, Lubellion the Searing Dragon and Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong> with it, this deck will be fully TCG.  My beautiful (my deck) mainly focuses on turboing out the Albaz fusions, but it can also win with the Despian fusion monsters and even the Dogmatika monsters, when used with <strong>Dogmatika Nation</strong>. The new <strong>Tri-Brigade Mercourier </strong>is a nice negate, and <strong>Unlikely Swordsoul Allies </strong>can summon any Dogmatika except <strong>Dogmatika Nexus</strong>.  If you use any fusion card to sent <strong>Despian Tradegy</strong> to the GY or banish it, you can add any Despia monster except itself from your deck to your hand, which allows instant combos, especially if you add <strong>Aluber the Jester of Despia</strong>, which lets you search any Branded Spell/Trap and also is a very powerful negate.  Going second is always your go to with this deck, because then your opponent can set up their board for you to break it. If they don't have the right monsters for you to fuse with, no worries! <strong>Radian</strong> and <strong>Jizukiru</strong> are there to help. Remember this is just a example of what the deck can look like. Feel free to play three of the best cards and also add your own, like <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> and <strong>Super Poly</strong>. Not to say the deck I made isn't playable or isn't any good, but for sure, you can definitely follow your own deck building flow. Tbh I didn't play three of some cards because I wanted to make room for others. I still think my deck is totally sweet, though.  You can bring out <strong>Mysterion the Dragon Crown</strong> by using a Dogmatika as material, and <strong>Keeper of Dragon Magic</strong> gets you materials and searches <strong>Fusion Substitute</strong>. Some might say <strong>Masquerade</strong> is a waste of time, but trust me, it's better then you think. Same with <strong>Maximus</strong>. You can also side out Extra Deck monsters you think are not necessary for different ones.  <em><strong>And Now Comes The Most Important Part!</strong></em>  Have fun.  I know it might sound cheesy, but having fun is what YU-GI-OH! is all about. I have no doubt that that is the full intention of the game: to make memories, to smile.  Have fun with this insane and sweet <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> deck. Enjoy, and feel free to share any ideas in the comments."

A single (uninterrupted) Hajun can turn into an Absolute Zero and a veritable Drident that floats on destruction. This paired with Balerdroch's continuous board prescnce and Eldlich's recursiveness (and generic zombie support) creates what I think can may be able to break into the meta. Granted, this deck is not going to be tier 1 or higher, but I believe it will be a semi-competitive deck that can actually see some success in the wake of Adventure, Phantom Knights, and combo Eldlich.  &nbsp;  Some notes:  <span>3x Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi:</span> This card is what is going to help push Mayakashi into meta contention. A link-3 that special summons the synchros from the GY on a quick effect best thing the archetype could have recieved, and is why I think it should be ran at 3 copies. The awesome part about this card is how it works with the link-2. If you link into the link-2, special summon Dakki, and the link up to the link-3, you can link back down into the link-2, special summon Dakki, and link back up again, letting you dump 2-3 of Icicle to the grave in a single turn. This does force you to play two of the link-2, which isn't great but is necessary.  <span>x2 Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi and Shiranui's Tale:</span> This card, in my opinion, is more of a gimmick than anything else. It's effect is absolutely busted, don't get me wrong, and will absolutely win you games if you can resolve it, but if you don't have access to your synchros or links it's more or less just a brick in hand. The number one issue with Mayakashi is how easy it is to stop it's main combo. An Ash, Imperm, or Veiler, will pretty much kill your Hajun's effect (which is why having Eldlich to fall back on is so important), and if your combo gets killed then you can't really make use of this card. Only playing two makes it so you can draw it sometimes but almost never in multiples. You can always search it if you know you can resolve it.  <span>No Crossout Designator</span>: I don't really think Crossout Designator is worth it in this deck. Crossout is really amazing when it is imperative that your combo go through, but is eh when you have cards to fall back on (like the Eldlich cards). I would rather have more extenders or Eldlich cards than draw a Crossout because Crossout is really a brick if you draw it at the wrong time or if you draw multiples. Granted, the Mayakashi half will lost to Nibiru every so often because there are no Crossout's to protect them, but if that happens you'll usually have the Eldlich cards to fall back on. Also, you'll usually be going hand neutral with your opponent's Nibiru if you've only used Hajun from the hand for your Mayakashi combo, which really isn't too bad.  &nbsp;  I really love Mayakashi and want to make this deck the best it can be. Any and all comments/critiques are appreciated, though I may take a while to respond."

The OTK is simple <ol>  	<li>Kaiju your opponent's monster</li>  	<li>Summon your tokens (Hippo Carnival spells)</li>  	<li>Leeching the Light (can be cast multiple times!)</li>  	<li>Attack with everything</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Other combos <ul>  	<li>Kaiju into Kaiju. Normal summon Neo Spacian Mole and bounce enemy's Kaiju back into your hand. Can be repeated every turn if your opponent doesn't can't deal with Mole.</li>  	<li>Try to bait out MSTs throughout the game by setting Waboku, Draw Muscle and Jar of greed. Set Tenyi the turn before you drop the combo.</li>  	<li>Angmarl the monarch can be summoned using your battle fader, performapal hip hippo or anchafroumite to search for whatever spell you need, usually Defence Muscle for draw. Leeching - Angmarl - 2nd Leeching if you want to commit hard.</li>  	<li>Summon anchafroumite BEFORE hippo tokens to get a 6th monster (extra monster zone) to swing with during your Leeching the Light turn</li>  	<li>Token Sundae is good to clear your board of tokens when it's clogged, while also removing enemy's backrow and battle immune or defence position monsters</li> </ul> The rest of the deck exists just to stall and draw for combo pieces. You probably want to go 2nd because cardcar d is your only turn 1 play.  Most games you can stall long enough to see 2x Leeching the Light and Delg the 3rd. But if you use up all your leechings (max combo 3 times) you probably lose. This deck gets countered pretty hard by itself (cards like battle fader, waboku, etc.)  Hippo tokens can wall off the opponent in a pinch but don't count on it. Piercing damage will hurt a lot. Use them for Defence Muscle draw and Token Sundae instead.  Use Waboku and Battle Fader to stall.  &nbsp;"

Now, it's actually really good. Even at 60 cards >:)","Okay, so I'm back with a revision to this chimera of a deck I made after I failed to read Adamancipator Analyzer's effect properly thinking it would work on Megalith. However, when I realized it didn't work I did however realize that they synergized well and after that went full-blown mad scientist and added in a Thunder Dragon engine and the deck worked well enough that I decided to stick to the idea and improve upon it.  If you want you can see the original deck here: https://ygoprodeck.com/adamancipator-megalith-thunder-dragon-no-this-isnt-a-joke/  So first I feel like I should explain the changes I made and why I made them.  C1: Ratio changes.  I have changed the ratios for the deck greatly to improve general consistency. Now the Adamancipator and Thunder Dragon decks are the core parts while the Megalith part is more included for some spicy plays like Numeron Dragon. I upped the previous thunder dragon package to a full engine to ensure I get Colossus more often and can set up Titan as well. I improved the Adamancipator Package by adding Guardian, I had to take out Leonite to account for the second Titan because I encountered a situation where I desperately needed it a few times. I also upped the Researcher to 3 but that was just to improve the deck slightly. I completely removed Friends because it really didn't matter. I removed the Impcantations because they did little to improve the deck and often ended up clogging the board which hurt the deck greatly. I changed around a few other cards and if you want to compare them you can check out the original list.  C2: Strategy changes.  Really the biggest change is that Thunder Dragon does the most legwork for the deck and the Adamancipator portion can get you some time to set up Thunder Dragon, or just win the game by itself in some cases. I added Verte to improve the Thunder Dragon portion and it has been a lifesaver on a few occasions. Other than that nothing has really changed since if the Megalith stuff happens the deck can really pop off, but even if it doesn't happen the deck can end up wild. In one case by turn 3 I tested how far I could go and ended on a Titan, Colossus, Access code, Borrel, Draglubion, and Numeron Dragon. Really the Numeron Dragon was just for fun but it was probably the single most explosive turn I had although if I played the deck better it could probably go higher.  C3: Changes in weaknesses.  These really haven't changed other than cards like macro or Dimensional fissure actually help the Thunder Dragon part greatly, you still get hosed pretty hard by skill drain if it gets set up for too long. Really, if I could add in some back row removal I would love to, if anyone has suggestions for a card to replace please tell me, I would love to know. My best guess would be to remove the Preparations and the Called by and put in 3 twin twister since it would help the Thunder Dragon portion with its discard effects. Ash blossom of course hurts but it can be managed.  C4: Changes against meta.  I'd say the only meta deck that counters the deck heavily is Eldlich but that's just because of the floodgates mostly. I haven't seen any Drytron yet and if an opponent had it they might have surrendered before I could find out. Chances are it's because I haven't hit Platinum yet but I'm close. I really just haven't had the time to play. Work and other obligations have gotten in the way. But I'll try and if I get there I will come back to update this portion."

My first concept even was splashing in a little <a data-name=""Silent Magician"">Silent Magician</a> engine, aiming to bring out <a data-name=""Silent Magician LV8"">Silent Magician LV8</a> because she's a 3500 body that is unaffected by your opponent's Spell effects, but ultimately scrapped it in favor of versatility in the form of Synchro and Xyz summoning (that's also why the link for this list says ""Silent Majespecters"" because my dumbass forgot to edit it before submitting so, that's annoying but anyway). Also, so long as a deck gives me an excuse to play <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a>, I will do it, since it's my favorite Pendulum Monster.</span>  <strong><span>The Main Deck:</span></strong>  <span>Might as well call it ""WIND Spellcaster, the deck"" because you'll be reading that a lot.</span>  <span><strong>• The Majespecters (x3 <a data-name=""Majespecter Fox - Kyubi"">Kyubi</a>, <a data-name=""Majespecter Toad - Ogama"">Ogama</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Majespecter Cat - Nekomata"">Nekomata</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Majespecter Crow - Yata"">Yata</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Bunbuku</a>)</strong> - Well... we can't really play a Majespecter list without Majespecter cards, so... self explanatory. They're all WIND Spellcaster Pendulum Monsters with Pendulum Scales of 2 and 5 that surprisingly does not have any Pendulum effect, and does something when Normal or Special Summoned, which are the following:</span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Fox - Kyubi"">Kyubi</a> searches a Majespecter Trap.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Toad - Ogama"">Ogama</a> sets a Majespecter Spell/Trap directly from your Deck.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Cat - Nekomata"">Nekomata</a> searches a Majespecter card.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Crow - Yata"">Yata</a> searches a Majespecter Spell.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Bunbuku</a> searches a Majespecter monster.</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a></strong> - <span>He's a 2100 ATK beater, that is a WIND Spellcaster, which is relevant for the purposes of both our Majespecter cards and Xyz Summoning. We could also always retrieve him with <a data-name=""Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess"">Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess</a> anyway, which is one of our primary defenders. His effect isn't as relevant since we're not really playing other Pendulum Magicians, which most of them are all at high rarity and there's not a lot of good pay off for them anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a></strong> - <span>Our only Tuner, because she's the only good low Level WIND Spellcaster Tuner at N/R rarity, and she's Level 1, so it shouldn't be hard to Synchro Summon with her.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></strong> - <span>Our <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, and we can only play it at 1 because Konami limited it for this format lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Majesty's Pegasus"">Majesty's Pegasus</a></strong> - <span>The archetypal Field Spell, non-searchable so play it at 3. Gives your Majespecters boost in ATK and DEF for added pressure because, they're honestly pretty frail. It also allows you to Tribute ANY WIND Spellcaster to Special Summon a Majespecter monster from the Deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Majespecter Spells (x3 <a data-name=""Majespecter Storm"">Storm</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Majespecter Cyclone"">Cyclone</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Majespecter Sonics"">Sonics</a>)</strong> - <span>We only play a few of these because this is still a Pendulum deck at the end of the day and we'd much rather search it through the effects of our Majespecter, except for Storm which is always nice to have. Don't worry, there are no <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in this format, so hurrah.

Their effects are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Tempest"">Tempest</a> is an archetypal Solemn Strike at a cost of only tributing a WIND Spellcaster monster, which is great in a low rarity format like this.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Tornado"">Tornado</a> tributes a WIND Spellcaster monster to target a monster your opponent controls and banish it.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Supercell"">Supercell</a> is a Continuous Trap that makes it so that while you have a Majespecter card in your Pendulum Zone, the activation and effects of your other Majespecter cards cannot be negated. It also allows you to recycle Majespecter cards (including itself) in your GY and draws you a card. Currently debating playing more of this for insurance.</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Igknight Reload"">Igknight Reload</a></strong> - <span>Consistency piece.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Synchro monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2300 ATK Level 4 WIND Synchro monster that's is a <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> when sent to the GY as a monster, and a permanent <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a> when removed while equipped to a monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2200 ATK Level 5 WIND Synchro monster, who is only relevant because she's a WIND, and that means she gets the protection that <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a> bestows when used as a Synchro Material for a WIND Synchro monster. You could play <a data-name=""Crystron Ametrix"">Crystron Ametrix</a> if you want a 2500 ATK beater instead, which is also neat because she switches all Special Summoned monsters your opponent controls to Defense Position upon her Synchro Summon.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Kendama"">Hi-Speedroid Kendama</a></strong> - <span>Another generic 2200 ATK Level 6 WIND Synchro monster that deals piercing damage and can revive itself on corner cases.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a></strong> or <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Zeta"">Psy-Framelord Zeta </a>- <span>A generic Level 7 Synchro monster that is a Battle Phase floodgate for monsters. It can also Special Summon 1 monster from your Pendulum Scale for the purposes of your Majespecter Spells/Traps. Zeta is just another generic Level 7 Synchro monster that can get rid of any of your opponent's Special Summoned monsters by banishing the two of them until your next Standby Phase, although requiring that monster to be in face-up Attack Position. Good against Xyz monsters.</span></span>  <span><b>• <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a> </b>- <span>Your main focus is not summoning this card as fast as you can, but if you can make this card, at least you have it when you need it, because it makes OTKing easier in a deck as slow as Majespecters.</span></span>  <span><strong>Xyz monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 25: Force Focus"">Number 25: Force Focus</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 6 monster with a Quick Effect targeting negation on any of your opponent's Level 5 or higher effect monsters. Also a good body at 2800 ATK and 2400 DEF. The only good Rank 6 option besides <a data-name=""Sword Breaker"">Sword Breaker</a>, which is a budget <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> for mono-type decks.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Firewall eXceed Dragon"">Firewall eXceed Dragon</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 4 beatstick, which is only here because we're playing Link 3 monsters, so we can pump it up to 4000 ATK.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board, which is neat because Majespecters do allow you to Pendulum Summon Level 4 monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 82: Heartlandraco"">Number 82: Heartlandraco</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 4 beater that gains a protection against battle, provided that you have a face-up Spell, and we're playing Pendulums and their Field Spell, so yeah. It can also attack directly by detaching an Xyz material.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess"">Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess</a></strong> - <span>A Rank 4 EARTH Rock Xyz monster that requires Spellcasters as Xyz material, in which we have plenty of, with an effect to detach an Xyz material to add a Level 5 or higher Spellcaster monster in your GY to your hand, which is why we can play <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a>. We can't really make full use of both its equip effects, being a Spell/Trap destruction and allowing a monster equipped with her to attack twice because we're not playing any enablers for it, but she's fine as a 2400 DEF blocker.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>A 2600 DEF body on board that has an interruption in the form of a replacement effect in response to an opponent's monster effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a></strong> - <span>It's a small towers monster, that can recycle itself and 2 of your Level 3 Majespecters in the GY upon getting sent there from the field.</span></span>  <span><strong>Link monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle"">Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle</a></strong> - <span>A Link 3 monster that requires 2+ WIND monsters, which we play plenty of. It's our main beatstick for the deck, which also happens to have good Link arrows for the purposes of Pendulum Summoning. Also messes up your opponent's GY set up.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a></strong> - <span>A generic Link 2 WIND Insect monster that's only here for the purposes of Link climbing.</span></span>  <strong><span>Additional notes and final thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>I'm not gonna lie, I've had a little bit of choice paralysis when it comes to building this deck but before everything else, free Kirin already Konami, I'm serious, this deck has a lot of versatile control tools, but lacks offensive pressure. This deck is so reliant on the Extra Deck and maintaining tempo to gain advantage, it's not even funny, but once you're able to pick up and keep it up, you'll most likely be fine because that's just the nature of control decks in general. I'm not really the type of person who are big on decks like this, so I'm sure anyone could pilot this more efficiently than me, but if I were to describe it, it's almost similar to playing Altergeists and even Salamangreats to an extent. You don't win by overwhelming your opponent, you win by burning their resources out, and in a slower format like this where only N/R rarity cards are legal, I think it's a pretty strong contender. Also, you could choose to play this deck at full control, by cutting out the Tuner and and other consistency pieces that you're comfortable not playing with and using Counter Traps or chainable Traps instead, but I think this deck already got more than enough back row to deal with your opponent's monsters mainly, so if I were to do it, I'd probably splash in some <a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a>, <a data-name=""Dust Tornado"">Dust Tornado</a> or <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon </a>to deal with back row, <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a>, <a data-name=""Pulling the Rug"">Pulling the Rug</a>, or <a data-name=""Forced Back"">Forced Back</a>. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Most of the rock support that had been racking up the last couple years have been largely untouched in the N/R event, and it comes together here in Triamid Adamancipator.  Triamid is a solid rock archetype that also has strong recursion and removal in the form of their field spells. In particular, Triamid Pulse does EVERYTHING for rock types: spot destruction, reviving a rock from the GY, and GY recycling of fieldspells with +1 draw! Triamid Loading makes every rock type monster float into a Triamid monster, and as an added bonus, searches out any Triamid S/T.  Just like in the usual Adamancipator strategies, the archetype is splashed into rock archetypes (in this case, Triamid) for easy access to bigger Extra Deck monsters and enhanced consistency.  Miracle Rupture has four targets in the deck to send to the GY and they each provide beneficial effects:  1. Nemeses Keystone (banish fodder for Gigantes, free summon and recycles banished monsters), 2. Tackle Crusader (Book of the Moon/Bounce S/T), 3. Revival Golem (Free body on board), and 4. Sentry Soldier of Stone (Free body on board).  With Adamancipator and Triamid working together coupled with generic rock support, a powerful midrange deck that turbos out Extra Deck monsters is made possible.

ZEXAL. Anyway, here I am presenting you one of the most cheesy beatdown deck in existence, Dark Mist turbo.</span>  <span>Why play this deck?</span>  <span>Well, the main goal of this deck is to bring out either <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Number 96: Dark Mist</a> or <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Number C96: Dark Storm</a>, and I'd say it's pretty fun, and you got access to one of the strongest Rank-Up-Magic spells in the game which surprisingly is just a R rarity, <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force</a>, which is a <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or more precisely <a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">Kali Yuga</a> except just for any face-up cards, especially in a format where Metalfoes will be everywhere.</span>  <strong><span>The Main Deck:</span></strong>  <span><strong>• The kitchen utensils (<a data-name=""Malicevorous Knife"">Knife</a>, <a data-name=""Malicevorous Fork"">Fork</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Malicevorous Spoon"">Spoon</a>)</strong> - <span>Number 96's archetypal monsters, the Malicevorous. Have three of them in grip and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a>. Have three of them and a Rank-Up-Magic and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Dark Storm</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Live Twins (<a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil"">Ki-sikil</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la"">Lil-la</a>)</strong> - <span>Either of them is a guaranteed two Level 2 bodies on board. Have either of them and a <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a> in hand and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a></strong> - <span>A free body, provided that you have at least 1 DARK monster, but can only Special Summon itself once per turn this way.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a></strong> - <span>Your crustiest Normal Summon. It's a Level 2 DARK Tuner, so I guess it works with <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a>. Gives you room to play Synchros, however much it matters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Giant Germ"">Giant Germ</a></strong> - <span>Your floater. The worst thing you could do in a turn is to set this card and pass.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Rank-Up Spells (x3 <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"">Numeron Force</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force"">Limited Barian's Force</a>)</strong> - <span>They're Rank-Up spells, the only one that we have access to that are generic, in fact. Limited Barian's Force is just your bare bones Rank-Up spell while Numeron Force, as for the reasons I have stated previously, is the best going second against an established board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psychic Blade"">Psychic Blade</a></strong> - <span>More Damage. You could also use <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a> instead, I guess.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - <span>Back row removal for coverage.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> </strong>- <span>Good against monsters with problematic effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dark Illusion"">Dark Illusion</a></strong> - <span>Greatest protection that we have access to, since most of our boss monsters are all DARK, and it's a Counter Trap, and we need to play as many protection as we can get since our boss monsters are pretty frail outside combat.</span></span>  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  <strong><span>Xyz monsters</span></strong>  <span><strong>• Number 96 (<a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Dark Storm</a>)</strong> - <span>Our main boss monsters. Although very fragile against card effects, I haven't seen anything in the N/R format that can trump this card in combat. Dark Storm is a bit sturdier, since it has an added protection of battle protection.</span></span>  <span><strong>• Number 65 (<a data-name=""Number 65: Djinn Buster"">Djinn Buster</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Number C65: King Overfiend"">King Overfiend</a>)</strong> - <span>Our second boss monsters. Djinn Buster has a quick play monster effect negation that also burns your opponent, while King Overfiend is a one-sided <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. That itself should speak volumes to this card's power in an extremely limited format like this.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a></strong> - <span>He is a walking <a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a> or <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> against any of your opponent's face-up card, provided that he himself also stays face-up on the field. He's also pretty tough, having a 2200 ATK body.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 43: Manipulator of Souls"">Number 43: Manipulator of Souls</a></strong> - <span>If all else fails, and we need to stall, we could always summon this card that is indestructible by battle or card effects, provided that we equip a ""Number"" card to it by its effect, in which we will most likely do since all Xyz monsters that we have are ""Number"" monsters.</span></span>  <strong><span>Synchro monsters</span></strong>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2300 ATK Level 4 WIND Synchro monster that's is a <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> when sent to the GY as a monster, and a permanent <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a> when removed while equipped to a monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Underworld Fighter Balmung"">Underworld Fighter Balmung</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2100 ATK Level 4 DARK Synchro monster that replaces itself upon getting destroyed by a card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Crystron Quandax"">Crystron Quandax</a></strong> - <span>A generic Level 4 Synchro Tuner monster, whose purpose is only to Synchro climb with <a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a> into <a data-name=""Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon"">Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon</a> in which if it wasn't obvious enough, clearly cope, but since we don't have anything else better to do anyway, why not?</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a></strong> - <span>A decent generic 2500 ATK Level 6 Synchro monster that mills the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck upon dealing battle damage.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon"">Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Summon this if you want/can, but don't focus on it. It's just here because of big number and because you could make it when the situation allows you.</span></span>  <strong><span>Honorable mentions</span></strong>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Cherry Inmato"">Cherry Inmato</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Plant Tuner that floats upon getting destroyed by battle.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Krebons"">Krebons</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Psychic Tuner that can just sit on the field and avoid battle destruction by paying 800 LP to negate an attack directed towards it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""T.G. Metal Skeleton"">T.G. Metal Skeleton</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Zombie monster just here because it can Special Summon itself after a monster (in your possession, most likely) is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Blackwing - Gust the Backblast"">Blackwing - Gust the Backblast</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Winged Beast monster that can Special Summon itself if you control no other cards.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dark Rose Fairy"">Dark Rose Fairy</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Fairy monster that can Special Summon itself from your hand if a Tuner monster(s) is Special Summoned, and can recycle itself by sending a card from your hand to the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Doppelwarrior"">Doppelwarrior</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from your hand if a monster(s) is Special Summoned from your GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Spear Cretin"">Spear Cretin</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Fiend monster that can set up an annoying battle phase loop where having access to at least 2 of these and 1 of them being in the GY is full ""combo"". After getting flipped, use its effect to Special Summon another Spear Cretin from your GY in face-down Defense Position. Its effect is not once per turn.</span></span>  <span>Final thoughts</span>  <span>I don't expect this to be a ""top tier"" deck, since it's not really the most versatile deck available for the N/R format, but I can see a potential with this deck alongside possibly having access to more control tools instead, and considering the other tools at its disposal. I'm definitely going to be testing more of this throughout the event, since there's a lot of other good extenders and/or starters that are rarity locked, like <a data-name=""Ret-time Reviver Emit-ter"">Ret-time Reviver Emit-ter</a>. Overall, it is a one trick pony deck that aims to abuse a very powerful Rank-Up spell and punish your opponent for unnecessarily overextending. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

It's not necessarily a good time playing against them but, you know... that's the point of the deck, and that's never your problem lmao. Not much lot else to say about the deck, especially if you've been playing this game for a long time, by now you should know how annoying Fairy monsters are. Yes, this deck plays slow but who cares if your opponent is unable to play at all.</span>  <span><strong>The main deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>The Fairies</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a></strong> - <span>Yes, this card is only a R rarity.

It protects your Set Spells/Traps from targeting and destruction, it recycles your Fairies and Counter Trap cards from your GY and stacks them to your Deck, and it counts as ""<a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a>"" for the purposes of our monsters' effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - Back row removal for coverage.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a></strong> - Walmart <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Imperm</a>, except it can be activated during the Damage Step.</span>  <span><strong>The Counter Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Seven Tools of the Bandit"">Seven Tools of the Bandit</a></strong> - <span>Trap negate at a cost of paying 1000 LP.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a></strong> - <span>Spell negate that forces your opponent to -1 just to negate this.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a></strong> - <span>Spell negate for the rest of the Duel at a cost of discarding a Spell specifically, that's why we can afford to play <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Chalices</a> and <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">MST</a>s for fodder.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forced Back"">Forced Back</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Normal Summon and waste it by returning it to the hand. Not good in terms of card advantage but good in terms of ramping up tempo.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Special Summons (that does not start a Chain) and destroy that monster for no cost.</span></span>  <span><strong>The side deck:</strong></span>  <span>Yes, no Extra Deck, because the available Fairy tuners suck so... yeah. Anyway.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Aurora Paragon"">Aurora Paragon</a></strong> - <span>YEP floodgate. You can afford to just set monsters anyway so it's not much of a big deal for you, plus you can recycle it with <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">Sanctum</a>, so that's that.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Chaos Trap Hole"">Chaos Trap Hole</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Special Summon of LIGHT or DARK monster(s) and banish them at a cost of 2000 LP.

Everyone who plays this game pretty much already knows what the strategy wants to do, or what it wants you not to do. It's a heavily reactive resource management based deck that always wants to go first to be able to set up plays, pretty much loses to massive consecutive board wipes, has weak recovery against faster decks, but in a slow format like N/R rarity only, I think it's got a good shot at finding success. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

It is very rogue but can win matches against every meta deck. </span><span>I built it with as strong as possible (in my opinion) and this list isn't budget at all. It offers many lines of combos to the player and I would say that this deck is rather hard to play and even harder to master. To play this competitively you cannot allow to misplay and I would recommend not to try to play this competitively if you cannot affort the expensive cards. Have fun trying out this list!</span>

They rely primarily on ""Fluffal"" archetype with boosting effects. ""Frightfur"" monsters also have offensive effects that either boost their <a title=""ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/ATK"">ATK</a> or grant additional attacks (""<a title=""Frightfur Bear"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Bear"">Frightfur Bear</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Tiger"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Kraken"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>""), removing cards on the opponent's field (""<a title=""Frightfur Tiger"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Leo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Leo"">Frightfur Leo</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Kraken"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Cruel_Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a>""), prevents the opponent from activating cards or effects when they attack (""<a title=""Frightfur Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Chimera"">Frightfur Chimera</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Sheep"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a>""), and even steal away an opponent's monster by equipping them to themselves or Special Summon them to their controller's field (""<a title=""Frightfur Bear"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Bear"">Frightfur Bear</a>"", ""<a title=""Frightfur Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Chimera"">Frightfur Chimera</a>"").  Some ""Frightfur"" monsters have a small weakness in having specific ""Edge Imp"" monsters for Fusion Materials (outside of ""Chimera""), but cards like ""<a title=""Frightfur Patchwork"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Frightfur_Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>"", ""<a title=""Fusion Reserve"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_Reserve"">Fusion Reserve</a>"" and ""<a title=""Fusion Conscription"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_Conscription"">Fusion Conscription</a>"" can help you in getting your needed ""Edge Imps"" to the hand and ""<a title=""Fluffal Sheep"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fluffal_Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a>"" helps in recycling both your ""Edge Imp"" and ""Fluffal"" monsters. All of the ""Edge Imps"" possess helpful abilities on their own, such as ""<a title=""Edge Imp Chain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>"" searching your ""Frightfur"" Spell and Trap support whenever it hits the Graveyard, ""<a title=""Edge Imp Saw"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Saw"">Edge Imp Saw</a>"" providing extra draw power, and ""<a title=""Edge Imp Tomahawk"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Tomahawk"">Edge Imp Tomahawk</a>"" being able to substitute for any of the other ""Edge Imp"" monsters should they not be available in the hand or field.  The Deck responds badly to too many out-of-archetype cards, as they cannot be fused with, and the other Summoning methods are not nearly as important as your Fusion Summoning. However, Fluffals can potentially be merged with archetypes such as <a title=""Gem-Knight"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gem-Knight"">Gem-Knights</a>, <a title=""Shaddoll"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shaddoll"">Shaddolls</a>, or <a title=""Invoked"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Invoked"">Invoked</a>.

Right now in this deck with both Adventurer engine and DPE engine there are more than 2 openings in this deck. It can go from Infinity and 1 handtrap to ABC+DPE+Masquerena with it's openings. Currently for this deck I made there are around 5 openings which is alredy a big plus for this deck that lost so much from getting his best combo card, Union Carrier, banned. You can start from classical Union Hangar opening or Galaxy Soldier opening to a brand new Adventurer opening. You can also open with DPE or with Gadget+Destrudo opening. Those alone can solidly for a rogue deck alone, but if openings are combined together, they can go against meta decks like Virtual World or D/D or Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika (ok the last one is bad to be honest but it is still played a lot online so I consider it a kind of meta deck). If you think that there are any better options for this deck, every idea is welcome."

Me neither.,"This deck is very simple. Tribute on opponents monster for a kaiju, and summon one of your own if you have it in your hand. then use a Mysterune spell to summon a Mysterune fusion monster. Attack the kaiju with the fusion monster to take 3000 damage to activate inferno tempest. Unless your opponent is playing Sky Striker or Eldlich, Inferno tempest should banish most of their deck, and since 3 Necroface have been banished, both players banish an additional 15 cards. Then finally finish mulling your opponent with your other Mysterune quick play spells and Hand Destruction. Called by the grave was added in incase your opponent tries to use hand traps on your draw cards. This decks big weakness is its hard to draw inferno tempest, and this deck is second going, so if you go first you just have to pray you can stay alive for a turn. Also Secret village of the spellcasters completely shuts this deck down. At the end of the day, this has been the best Inferno Tempest mull deck I've played, hope you enjoy!  <strong>EDIT:</strong> Oh! Don't forget, Mysterune spells skip your next battle phase, meaning you have to summon your Mysterune fusion monster during your battle phase and NOT your main phase, otherwise you can't attack and the combo is ruined."

Basically summoning beat sticks and shattering your enemy. Only thing is that you need to rely on ""Malefic World"" for most matches. Nonetheless ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" is a life-saver for this deck as well as ""Malefic Divide"" since you'll be discarding and banishing monsters quite a lot. I believe it's quite a risky deck but def worth the fun and truly powerful when you learn how to play with it. Also, I believe that two ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" might not be enough, as well as the one ""Malefic Divide"", so maybe adding an additional copy would make it better or perhaps add a ""Monster Reborn"" or smth.  The cards on the side deck are alternatives for some of the cards in the deck. ""Effect Veiler"" can replace ""Skill Drain"", and the extra ""Malefic Paradox Dragon"" can replace ""Baronne De Fleur"". Unfortunately, I can't think of any other replacements for the rest of the deck, in case some might be too expensive."

Fun deck to keep up with the Meta in Master Duel","If you're looking for a deck to help battle the meta slaves, this might be the one. Aside from the huge upfront cost to build this deck, it is super fun and sets up unbeatable boards like those at the top of the tier list.  There are no single line plays for this deck so it can take a while to get familiar with it but the general gist of how to play it goes something like this.  Step 1: Get two pendulum monsters on the board.  Step 1.5: If you can complete step one while having an additional Mythical Beast Jackal King, you're gonna have a good time. This will stop many hand traps from ruining the rest of your combo.  Step 2: Link Electrumite and put Astrograph Sorcerer into your extra deck  Step 3: Pop a pendulum spell with Electrumite and return Astrograph to your hand, special summon him, add one card to your hand and draw a card.

Step 6: From this point there are a few way to go, a lot of time time your board will be stacked enough to just end, but sometimes you need to flex more so go into Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and pop him with a Mighty Master or if you have enough material on the board, use Vortex Dragon and another card to go into Masquerena to go into Apollousa next turn for more negate.

This is my attempt at casting the Invader of Darkness as a viable boss monster within a worthy deck, focusing on graveyard revival strategies, Squires and Dark Spirit cards for his consistent summoning and shutdown of quick-play spells (Chalice, MST, E. Teleport, B. of Moon, Super Poly, Cyclone, Controller, Twisters, etc). Depending on the match-up, Vanity's Fiend and Lair of Darkness can further shut down your opponent's ability to summon monsters and defend against the Invader!  I enjoy Allure and Upstart as draw cards that help prevent bricking, along with the first effect of Dark Spirit's Mastery as the primary search card for the Invader of Darkness (IOD). Usually, hard-drawing IOD isn't absolutely terrible: seeing him <strong>or</strong> Mastery in your opening hand, with Edea <strong>or</strong> Reinforcement, will bring out Invader of Darkness on your first turn. Play Mastery (If you don't have IOD in hand) to Discard 1 &gt; Search &amp; Add IOD &gt; Normal summon Edea (or use Reinforcement to search Edea first) &gt; Special summon Eidos &gt; Use Eidos' effect to tribute both Squires to Tribute summon IOD. If you hard draw IOD <strong>and</strong> Mastery: Play Mastery &gt; Discard IOD &gt; add another IOD from your deck. (IOD is decent in the GY if you control a Dark Spirit monster). If you don't have / aren't able to get IOD to hand while controlling the Squires, Extra Deck plays can save you (thinking Phoenix / Unicorn). You can rebuild a board the turn after Tribute or Link summoning away the Squires: Banish Eidos from GY &gt; Special summon Edea from GY &gt; Special summon Eidos (from deck). The Squires' special summoning effects thrive when they're in the GY together.  I've tried Double Coston and Doomdog in the deck for reliable tribute summoning and searching for IOD, but think the Squires' ability to re-build a board (after being sent from Tribute / Link summoning or your own board wipe with Torrential Tribute), in <strong>addition</strong> to making tribute summoning easier in general is just too good for me to pass them up. The downsides are that their stats are terrible, Edea is a LIGHT type, and you need 3x of each to fuel the Squire engine but you do NOT want to hard-draw into Eidos; he is only useful in your deck, graveyard or on the field. (That's where Allure can help, along with cards like Mastery and Reincarnation that allow you to discard 1). If anyone has better ideas for low-level monsters, please share - I'm not currently incorporating Tuners / Synchros though I understand there's great DARK support in the Synchro world (Thinking Beelze).  GY revival strategies (however cheap they are), also work in summoning IOD quickly; Foolish Burial can send IOD while Reborn or Call of the Haunted can special summon him. By quick-effect, either Dark Spirit monster card can trade places with IOD in the GY. Foolish and a Malice in your opening hand, for example, means IOD will make an appearance on your field within a turn: Play Foolish &gt; Send IOD to GY &gt; Normal summon Malice &gt; (set traps) &gt; pass turn &gt; Swap Malice for IOD (quick-effect) when your opponent does basically anything. (IOD loses his effect when summoned by a Dark Spirit, simply becoming a 2900 beatstick / eventual XYZ material, so this is not the primary strategy).  Vanity's Fiend is my current back-up boss monster for this deck, with his timing being crucial and summoning being conditional (a level 6, not searchable, can't be special summoned, etc). Ha Des and Neosphere are alternative back-up bosses in the side deck. Dark Necrofear could also work well (being a level 8 and searchable by Mastery, summonable with the Dark Spirits). In the extra deck, Zombiestien, Lancelot, Zombie Vamp and Queen of the Night can step in when the IOD isn't cutting it. Zombiestein is a beatstick with a single negate at the cost of detaching one and switching him to defense (DEF/1000). Lancelot can attack directly, pop one monster <strong>and </strong>negate one spell/trap. Queen of the Night requires 3x Level 8's so she hardly ever comes out, but two of her effects are useful: detach 1 to negate 1, or detach one to give a little attack boost to another monster. Thanatos (Rank-4) is great if Armageddon and Grepher are on the field and I want to make a heavy-hitter that becomes immune to card effect (quick-effect) by detaching 1. Break Sword is a great Rank-3 if you end up drawing several Dark Spirits, with his ability to destroy 2 cards (one of your own, one of your opponent's).  Lair of Darkness can really shut down some decks' engines if they are attribute-specific, so my side deck runs 3x copies. It doesn't do much against certain decks, sort of like Zombie World, which has a similar effect and is usually only sided-in for specific match-ups. Torrential Tribute can devastate your opponent and leave you relatively unharmed if you control the Squires. Once banished from you GY, Eidos will special summon Edea from the GY, who can special summon another Eidos from the Deck, allowing for a very easy Tribute summon of IOD (if he's in your hand), all while your opponent's board has been wiped. If you had Call in your back row when you activated Torrential, and you destroyed an IOD on your field, you can bring him back out through Call's revival.  If there are any suggestions, please let me know - thanks!"

The idea was a super-pure combo deck that uses Cherubini to send a Shaddoll, Rusty to help set-up Requiems into Isolde to access Dark Law into Verte for Magicalized Fusion to make Winda. The combo actually works pretty well when you see Tour Guide or enough Extenders, but doesn't really leave room to play interaction, which makes siding hell and going second pretty rough. Still, I love this type of extended combo, I love putting up weird boards, and I wanted to manifest that in this deck.  This is take 2. Accesscode is decent for breaking boards and OTKing, but in the backrow matchup I really want Unchained Abomination. Cicada King is only an on-field monster negate, and truly wasn't worth making nearly as often as I thought, so I popped in Tornado Dragon. This gives me some sort of plan against Trap decks. To help the situation going second, I added some interactive cards - TTT isn't really great going second right now, but it certainly isn't bad, and it helps the deck play through hand traps and gather information going first, so it's lower risk than some other options. Imperm always seems sweet, but here a bluff is extra value. I don't think Droplets is that good in this deck going first, it is a very very card hungry deck, so these are mostly just discard fodder, but going second these can help break those unbreakable boards, and for amazing value. This makes siding less miserable, going second at least possible, and rounds things out in Trap matchups, but also makes the inconsistency problems the deck has worse, since you won't be seeing that broken starter (Tour Guide) as often. Still, being able to actually play Yu-Gi-Oh is nice, and reducing the brickiness of the deck is also nice.  It became a problem not to run 2 Dark Rank 4 Xyz for the Break Sword combos, so I cut Abyss Dweller, which was redundant with Dark Law anyways, and added Time Thief Redoer. Because you can often make a Rank 4 with a Trap and a Monster, Redoer seems like the best bet - there are a couple on-field negates, a versatile Book of Moon or two, and a couple very specific ways to negate summons, and not a lot else interesting in terms of Dark Ranks 4s, and Redoer does a half-decent Tornado Dragon impression while maybe sneaking extra value vs Spell heavy decks. I cut down interruption cards - while it is important to have some, the deck also already had some consistency issues, and the interruption suite made them a lot worse, so I'm trying to do damage control without giving up on going second."

This is what I came up ultimately. This is a hyper aggressive combo deck, that's why we play 31 monsters. Trust me, if you get into your combo, this deck is almost unstoppable. Unfortunately the original Red Dragon Archfiend, Red Nova Dragon and Hot Red Dragon Archfiend are no longer good anymore. The next best level 8 synchro monster is Chaos Ruler, that's why I play two copies. Supernova outpowers Red Nova in every sight, I replaced that one. I don't play Burning Soul, because you need to have combo to make this card live and if you want to make King Calamity in your opponents turn, it misses timing if you want to add a card from your graveyard. Don't get me wrong you still can play this card, but I would recommend not to. I choose Effect Veiler over Imperm, because it's a light tuner monster which comes in clutch for Supernova and Chaos Ruler.  Combo 1: Crimson Resonator + Wandering King Wildwind <ol>  	<li>Specialsummon Crimson, since you control no monsters</li>  	<li>Specialsummon Wildwind, since you control a fiend-type monster with 1500 atk or less</li>  	<li>Go into Red Rising and use its effect to bring back Crimson</li>  	<li>Effect Crimson, since you control only crimson and one dark-dragon-synchro monster</li>  	<li>Specialsummon one Creation Resonator and one Synkron Resonator</li>  	<li>Go into Supernova using Crimson, Creation, Synkron and Red rising</li>  	<li> Effect Synkron, add back Crimson to your hand</li>  	<li>Congratulations, you haven't even normalsummoned</li> </ol> Combo 2: Crimson Resonator + Ascator, the Dawnwalker <ol>  	<li>Specialsummon Crimson</li>  	<li>Effect Ascator, discard one, specialsummon Ascator from your hand and the fire ant from your deck</li>  	<li>Use fire ant and Ascator to go into Chaos Ruler</li>  	<li>Chaos Ruler effect: (You wanna see Synkron, Handtraps, Wildwind, Red Reign, Red Familiar etc.)</li>  	<li>Crimson effect: specialsummon one Chain Resonator and one Synkron from your deck (or two Synkron, depends)</li>  	<li>Go into Supernova using everything</li>  	<li>Effect Synkron, bounce back one Resonator you need</li> </ol> This is only the tip of the iceberg, there are way more combos.

Preferably go for White Wing Magician and Purple Poison Magician so that you can summon Timestar Magician, or an alternative is Harmonizing Magician. What we are going for here is trying to maximize our way to get Z-ARC out right now, Timestar being summon after using Pendulum Call will basically mean it and your other ""Magician"" monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects until your opponents end phase. With Timestar out you can also send the materials you need to grave using it's effect if the opponent attempts to destroy your pendulum scales, so if you have Double Iris and Black Fang already send White Wing and Purple Poison and vice versa. Then next turn search out Astrograph/Chronograph and bring out Z-ARC, united we stand is in there so that you can equip it onto Z-ARC so he can't be destroyed in battle unless they destroy the equip spell or they gain Z-ARC's attack points, United We Stand gives Z-ARC an extra 800 points per face up monster on the field so start bringing out a bunch of preferably strong monsters so you can back him up without worry! I've been playing Supreme Kings since they came out and built the deck the way I like it."

Other cards like Spiritual Forest and Wall of Thorns can further stall attacks, especially if you control all of them at once. The offensive strategy comes into play when the deck's powerful Synchro and XYZ boss monsters reach the field, with efficient help from low-level Tuners like Hope Ear Squadron and Rose Girl. Board-clearing traps (like Torrential and Wall of Thorns) are built in to reinforce the risk of backfire, so your board is protected and allowed to build each turn.  Lonefire is an amazing going-first Normal summon, with an effect allows you to special summon any Plant monster from your Deck by tributing itself (or another Plant you control). If you have set Wall of Thorns and control Lonefire in Attack position, you can Bait an attack on Lonefire and destroy their attack-position monsters, but if they don't attack, you benefit from Lonefire's effect each turn until it's off the field. Rose Paladin helps get main deck bosses to your hand and onto the field as quickly as possible via discarding herself to allow you a Deck search. For the Tuners, Hop Ear lets you Synchro summon during your opponent's turn, while Rose Girl recycles herself back to your hand and, being a Level 3 Earth type, can XYZ summon Meliae who can either give you a foolish burial effect (to send Hermitree), or the special summon (in defense) of any Plant from your Deck (almost always going to be Chirubime).  Foolish Burial is almost always used to send Sylvan Hermitree to the GY, which by effect, allows you to re-arrange the top three cards of your Deck in any order, giving you more control over your next turn. Chirubime sets up a wall, special summons other Plants from the Deck, is an Earth-type and serves as excellent Rank-8 material. Any card effect that lets me special summon a Plant directly from my Deck is almost always going to be used on Chirubime in DEF for her amazing effects. Talaya is like a more offensive Level 8 Water-type version of Chirubime, who protects your other Plants from card effects while giving herself an ATK boost off of them. I'm still looking into alternative boss monsters for the Main Deck (Level 8 or 9 for the XYZ summons) and am absolutely open to hearing suggestions!  The Synchro and XYZ monsters are what will give your opponent the most trouble. Ideally, Black Rose Dragon is summoned at the correct time to clear the field and go in for game. Queen of Thorns is super useful in this deck, especially if Ancient Forest is at play. She does 1,000 Burn damage to your opponent for every non-Plant monster they summon until she's dealt with. If she's destroyed by battle, your opponent's attacking monster is too (if you control Ancient Forest), and if Spiritual Forest is also on the field, she's protected from one attack per turn (you still take battle damage). Fairy King (XYZ) is extremely easy to bring out as well, using Rose Paladin and/or Eco. In addition to being great XYZ material in this deck, Eco can dual-serve as a hand-trap when/if burn damage is dealt to you, being special summoned rather than discarded.  The World Tree, if preserved, grows counters when Plants go to the GY, two of which can be removed to destroy one card on the field. Plenty of Plant monsters end up in and out of the GY with this Deck, so this effect can usually go off once per turn as long as the tree stands. You can use Frozen Rose to send one Plant to the GY to draw two and feed the World Tree one counter. Wall of Thorns is like running three copies of Mirror Force, enforcing the deck's overall defensive-yet-aggressive strategy when you bait an attack. I think Spiritual Forest is stupid good in this deck as well, putting up yet another reason why your opponent would<strong> not</strong> want to declare an attack, forcing them to use card effects to get rid of your board."

The goal was to work with Sephylon's difficult summoning condition and make him a viable boss monster in a deck, where the Level 8 Fairies he can summon also perform well on their own as powerful bosses in their own right (Primarily Kristya with 1x Hyperion as a backup boss (interchangeable with Vanity's Ruler, Guardian Eatos (although not searchable), Phosphorage, Majestic Mech - Goryu, Splendid Venus, or whatever high level Fairy you choose)).  The Herald of Perfection can grant you at least one, usually up to three, negates per turn, by discarding other Fairy monsters from your hand (Heralds are hand-traps in and of themselves). I run 3x Purple Herald in the side deck in case I face a trap-heavy deck (thinking Eldlich). The Heralds' discard effects quickly fill your GY and make summoning Sephylon possible, who can be searched by Card of the Soul (while you have 8000K Life Points) or Power Angel Valkyrie. Power Angel can search Sephylon from the deck if she's on the field while you negate something your opponent does, most easily accomplished by discarding a Fairy while you control Perfection. An alternative is to activate something like a Solemn trap while you control Power. The Agent of Creation / Shine Ball engine is not only great for getting 3-4 Fairies in the GY quickly, but also for the obvious Link-summoning capabilities. Manju makes getting Perfection on the field doable within 2 turns.  While Sanctum of the Parshath is on the Field, you can Link summon Celestial Airknight Parshath and use its effect to add Sephylon to your hand from your Deck. This card with Hyperion allows you to pop two cards per turn by banishing Fairies from your GY, which shifts focus from the Sephylon strategy to a different one, where Fairies are being <strong>removed</strong> from the GY and thus casting aside fuel for Sephylon's summoning. Foolish Burial is just plain helpful for filling the GY with monsters more quickly. Valhalla is there to special summon Kristya or Hyperion to avoid bricking with them. Terraforming is still in the Side Deck only because I once ran a single copy of The Sanctuary in the Sky to protect against battle damage."
