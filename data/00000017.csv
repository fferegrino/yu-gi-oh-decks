Haven't seen one like this on here in a while so figured I'd share since it rends to be fairly effective.  I wouldn't touch any of the Dragonmaid ratios, since you really wanna open one of the main three. In general any 1 of the dragon maids guarantees you'll at least end on a Hieratic Seal, making bricking fairly difficult. You can lower Ernus by one if you wish. Chamber and Parlor can search/send a card to bring them back from the GY and then be linked away for a link 1 and brought back for the Seal. Kitchen and Nurse ask that you have at least one extender card in your hand. You generally wanna end with a Hieratic Seal or Sheou on the field and a couple backrows. The deck can consitently have 2-4 bounce/negate/destruction effects during your opponents turn, an a banish or two depending on what sort of backrow you drew. Don't forget that your big Dragons have in hand effects (Ernus can be an extender, but perhaps a better use is to summon chamber during your opponent's first turn to get a free search before your turn starts, and Tinkheck lets you easily attack over a lot of big monsters who might be problematic otherwise). Play whatever handtraps you want.  Spells and traps are also fairly simple and I don't think they need to be shuffled around. Dragonmaid Welcome and Dragonmaid Downtime are such amazing cards that basically guarantee you'll have a full hand at all times. With Sheou, a chamber in the GY and Downtime on the field you can search twice per turn, both your own and your opponent's. Dragonmaid Changerover at one is something to consider changing. You can search it, but drawing it is really convenient, and god help you if that one copy gets banished. Replace the one World Legacy Guardragon with a Monster Reborn. For the non-Dragonmaid traps, play whatever you want, the set I'm using there just happens to be my preference.  Extra deck can be whatever. I'd only advise to absolutely play Seal at 3. It does so much for the deck and the non-targeting, non-destruction removal is just a life saver. I'm paranoid about grind games so I play the Dragonmaid extra decks at 3 both but it's probably not necessary, especially since Sheou shuffles itself back. Link 1s are important for those weak hands I mentioned at the start. Guardargons can technically be used for a play but I only ever use them as Pot of Prosperity fodder.  &nbsp;  That's about it. As I said the deck itself is really simple and it should be obvious what to do. It manages its resources really well, especially the moment a Sheou is on the field so you generally can just keep going once you set up your first board. This is the first deck I've submitted so please feel free to criticize the heck out of it."

Rikka, Sunavalon. ","Warning: Not a good deck. Just my current reference building point towards something.  The current build of this deck is using 60 cards, but I'm work this down to 40-42. I saw something interesting numbers at 41. I'm going to ignore that and take my building of this deck 1 step at a time.  The idea of this deck build came to me, when I realize Water is pretty grindy attribute. Rikkas are already a pretty grindy deck. Not the best grindy deck. Definitely not the best grindy deck out of the box that it came out of. I just saw something interesting if I fuel its grindiness.  First off. Rikka is the core. It's archetype has some pretty interesting mechanics. It is still missing cards imo.  Rikkas role as the heart of the deck is be a surprise deck. That is all. Played a few people at my locals. Just... not alot of people know what youre doing. They usually have to shotgun the cards they know.  Generaiders. I'm actually going to cut Harr and Spell/traps. With the current 60 card count. They're unreliable. Mardel's search effect is way to important, to use on another Generaider card. Mardel, herself, is abit of pain due her lv9 status. But since Mardel can search plants and give me access to Rank 9 plays. SHE STAYS!  Sunavalon: They actually provide some pretty good options. They can interact with GY. Provide Link fodder for Jasmine plays. Shrine is pretty interesting. Alittle short of insane. I don't think alot people understand the borderline broken effect it has. It allows me to re-set any Continuous Trap in my GY. Due to that. I don't need 3 copies of the very restrictive Bloom. And then there's the SS2 lingering effect on Bloom. If you play Sunavalon; Always consider Zepyhros.  Cutting down both Sunseed's from 3 to 2(or 1).  Draw Cards: I'm playing way too many. But that's the point. Moray can be used whenever you meet its cost. Jack-in-the Hand, can help dig out a lv1 for plays or incentivize getting a lv1 plant in the GY. Salvage helps keep your Rikka targets out of the GY and load your hand. I won't say its a plus 1. But if Mudan is a target can lead to extra advantage. Prosperity will be very powerful, when I fine tune the extra deck for the right targets. I will safely help me further dig into my deck.  One for One. Self explanatory.  Pollinosis is a placeholder. I'm just a fan of the card and how it can play with the Rikka tribute mechanic. Like, popping a Strenna, to go into another Teardrop or Kanzashi or... Treebeast.  Torrential is just a package I added as a placeholder. I can switch between a Raigeki package and Harpie's FD package.  Extra Deck is pretty basic. Its focused on Rikka and Sunavalon. With Rikka's being more board control and aggro and Sunavalon [Thrasher] being the donkey puncher. Again with the Bloom. If Bloom can stick, with the Lv4 Link and Thrasher, It's actually pretty much game over.  Missing items: Evil Thorn and Lonefire Blossom. I know they're staples. And I have already got my eye on what needs to go bring them in. Also, missing other staple plants like Rose Girl. Spore, if I add a Synchro target. Carrotweight.  Hand Traps: I'm balancing between 3-6 spots. If I go with 4, I will be going with the Psy-Frame or a Artifact package.  I am also looking into using Formud Skipper and Parallel Exceed. But I almost feel like I will lose the identity of the deck and also, if I start going down the cyberse road. Accesscode Talker wont be too far from the next exit."

Putting Adamancipators into this deck was an amazing idea. This deck will usually get you a synchro and 1 or 2 fusions every hand. And that's jut the bare bone. This deck rarely ever bricks, and(Just like another FUN fusion spell we all know and...love?) fossil fusion allows you to use your opponent's monsters in the GY and when you do, gives the monster targeting protection. And when your fusion is destroyed, you can add it back to your hand to fusion all over again. And the  adamancipator is a great way to get rid of opponent cards, special summon more rocks, fusion material for fossil fusion, negate baits, etc., etc. Anyways, that's all from me, I'll see you next week.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_9n-evKkxY"

Have you ever been frustrated with the lack of penguins and giant monsters comprising the board state? Well no more! &gt;:) Introducing; Penguins! Warning: Penguins may contain elements of generic water support. Penguins may also emphasize a hard lean against hand traps. Please consult your dueling physician before using Penguins.  Heh, so, this deck has a couple different minor combo routes, centered around either Genex Undine/Rosenyx plays (going into Halq and having a pretty neat go-second board that can end on either Savage Dragon or Sigma on your opponent's turn, ideally after bouncing something to their hand as disruption and discarding a card from their hand with Locust) or the Kaiju boardwipe into Great Emperor Noot, into Nopenguin/Glacial Beast, which turns into Brave/Nope/any face down penguin you'd like. That's off of a board wipe. We have fun here. It's definitely not meta, but it does pack a bit of a punch especially against monster-oriented decks. Less so vs back-row heavy stuff, hence the sideboard, and if the opponent has monsters that can disregard being tributed or targeted, or they like to make a nasty board that one kaiju simply won't deal with, sometimes the only answer is to nuke it from orbit, just to be sure (i.e. more board wipes).

The deck is organic but definitely a smidge on the luck-based side, what ","Here it is, the culmination of all my experience playing Dangers, Kaijus, and board-breaking decks in general. For your consideration, I present to you;  Danger Kaijus; The Rank 8 Specialists  So, let's review; obviously this deck will not be *as* good against a backrow-oriented deck on the first round. That said, if back-row is all they have, between Bigfoot, Thunderbird, and your extra deck (which contains my old friend Heliopolis! :D blow up ALL the things!), you can take out a decent chunk of their resistance before you go neck-deep into your main play.  What is the main play, you ask? Why, XYZ summoning into a Draglubion OTK of course. &gt;:) I personally enjoy going into a Rank 4 support card like Daigusto Emeral or Dugares to help your resource management and pad the amount of Ranks on the board, then do the thing, because this guarantees a Number 100 with at least 13,000 attack which can OTK over any of your Kaijus. If you have enough for an extra Rank 8 first, you could also go into some hand trap insurance, like Photon Lord or Dingirsu (for destruction effects, specifically). And from there, the strategy is more or less as it always has been; Go second, break whatever board they have over your knee, preferably with a sickening snap, and run them over with the lorgest of lads.  Seriously, while I haven't been able to test it in person, I've been playing a lot of Dueling Nexus and the deck's performed admirably, especially for a deck that relies so heavily on luck and the gods of RNG. There's a heap of draw, a fair bit of recycling, and a great extra deck toolbox to handle a wide variety of situations. The side deck is based almost entirely on specific match-ups. The back-row hate is for Sky Strikers and other back-row oriented decks, the Jinzos are for freaking Elditch. Dark Ruler No More is in there for the same reason the C Tachyon is; just seems like a generally reliable choice when attempting to shut down a board that's beyond even our ability to outright blow the heck up, or if there are shenanigans afoot with monsters who have specific immunities. There Can Be Only One still pulls it's weight admirably after all this time, and the Virus... Ok, so look. Full Force Virus is basically a filler until I do more testing. That could be any Virus. Or any other two cards. But Full Force felt like a nice one to hit combo starters, monster-based hand traps, and other kinds of strategies out of the hand before they become a problem.  So that's it. That's the entire deck laid bare before us. Hope you like it. :)"

Attack with 2 Michions ( halve your opponent's LP twice) first then with Sandaion ( -2000LP). You can XYZ summon Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max to deal another 2000 LP  Another strategy is well use the 3 Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries in  the Extra to get rid of whatever strong cards in your opponent's Extras.

","This is a re-upload of a deck I posted in February, back when snake lily wasn't revealed yet, and after month of playtesting. Some elements have changed since, but the core strategy is still the same.  The deck now has some potential going first thanks to snake lily and cards like Hyperyton, but you still prefer to go second since your otk options are very easy to access.  The idea is to injure the opponents board with strong equalizers before spamming your field with reptiles and accessing your Xyz 8 toolbox to OTK. Curse and Aleth make it easy with snake rain ( or just Nunu and another Ogdoadic ) so you can end game quickly with Numeron Dragon. If you can't otk that turn, then setup the ogdoadic king/queen/overlord or Zeus to disrupt your opponent's follow up.  Lair of darkness is insane in this deck and so is Darkest Diabolos. You can tribute your opponent's monster to summon yours from the graveyard , which bypasses almost every kind of protection. It's one of the easier ways to get rid of problematic cards. Even Arima is nice, not only because it searches Lair, but it's effect is actually useful, on top of being a lvl4 : you can search Nihil, Nessie, Jackalope or Diabolos depending on what you need.  Lamia and Hydra are nice little engine that clears boards and gives you cards to work with. It doesn't interact well with targeting protection though. Echidna is situational and be careful with her, as her search effect prevents you from going into your Rank 8.  Dangers are here for ""consistency"" and they open up Xyz play. Its weird to speak about consistency with danger!s but that's what they actually do here, kind of how they did in Thunder dragon back in the days. There is just no better equivalent to ""extenders that load the graveyard and cycle through the deck"" and you need all of that. Tsuchinoko is searchable with King of the Feral Imp or Echidna, which is actually very relevant because one more monster can be crucial to tribute for your Ogdoadic graveyard summons.  If you don't open your equalizers, try baiting as much negates as you can, you will see that you can go through much.  The side deck is just good going second cards, but you can put whatever you like as long as you can break boards. Careful with the barrier statue of the wind, as you will need the wind insect kaiju to out it as Gameciel don't work. Be sure to pack Backrow hate as that kind of deck can become akward to deal with. Viruses can also be considered in the side for going first.  Some changes that can be considered : <ul>  	<li>Teardrop the Rikka queen can be played instead of Hyperyton. She's less powerful but she can be made without tributing Strenae if need be.</li>  	<li>Hieratic dragon overlord of Heliopolis ( instead of Dingirsu ) is very good if Lair is on the field, but only ok without. Also the fact that it detaches a material matters compared to dingirsu, as it makes your recusive loop accessible on the following turn.</li>  	<li>The whole Galaxy cipher dragon Xyz package is good but redundant with hydra and lamia. Some cute things you can do is using muddy mudragon to fuse the  Galaxy-eyes cipher ex dragon that is on top of a monster stolen by the og cipher dragon into a red-eyes dark dragoon.</li>  	<li>a Dragoon pakage because why not ?</li>  	<li>some good rank4 like Abyss Dweller</li>  	<li>most handtraps are changeable, but some have extra synergy : Gamma on your own turn is godlike as it puts 2 monsters on your field, ready to get tributed for your ogdoadics. Nibiru also leaves a monster on your field which is very appreciated.</li> </ul> Weakness to droll&amp;lockbird,  Skullmeister, Ghost Belle and backrow heavy decks. Abyss Dweller is an auto lose if you don't draw gamma or imperm.  Let me know in the comments if you would make any changes or if I missed some cool interactions ! Enjoy !"

A negate, a board wipe, and very likely Eldlich access.  <em><strong>The Nunu and Nauya open respecting Nibiru</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nunu effect, send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya effect, send Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nunu with it's effect, and tribute it for Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nauya from Keurse effect and add Water Lily</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, and use Aleirtt effect to return Nauya and Nunu to grave</li>  	<li>Overlay for Rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Go cry to mommy because you made a sub par play due to a crippling fear of rocks</li> </ol> It plays around Nibiru and you end with a negate. Oh, and I guess Eldlich access if you drew the right cards.  This particular combo does demonstrate the loop I referred to though, using Aleirtt to ensure access to your engine next turn and have access to Ogdoabyss on the follow up with Water Lily once your single negate is destroyed and your opponent fails to OTK.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>The Nunu+Zohah open</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Discard Nunu, send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Normal summon Zohah, Special Nunu from grave</li>  	<li>Overlay for King of the Feral Imps, using the effect to add Nauya</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya sending Keurse</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral imps for Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nauya off of Keurse, and add Water Lily to hand off of Nauya's effect</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily here, sending Ogdoabyss which will be your 5th reptile in grave and then Special Summon it</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, it will be banished until you can bring it back next turn, no way to play around that which is why Activating Water Lily was important.</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah's gy effect to discard any card in your hand (like a useless/dead golden land trap)</li> </ol> Combo 2 of ideal end board, no real way to play around Nibiru  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Nauya and Zoha open</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nauya and send Keurse</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Zohah, and tribute it for Keurse, and special from Keurse's effect Nauya</li>  	<li>Resolve Nauya by adding Water Lily, resolve Zohah's effect by adding Null and discarding an unwanted card.</li>  	<li>Activate Null and send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Special Null with it's own effect and overlay into King of the Feral Imps</li>  	<li>Activate King of the Feral imps getting another Null for next turn</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral Imps for Aleirtt, having no cards banished</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily, send Ogdoabyss, it will be the 6th reptile in grave, Special summon it</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah effect to get any other unneeded cards into the grave yard</li> </ol> Full Combo, possible lord access and it doesn't leave a card banished.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Nunu</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nunu sending Zohah</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah's gy effect discarding a card to add it to your hand.  you REALLY want to discard one of the tribute monsters here, the dream scenario is one of the 2 Aleirtt's or the one Ogdoabyss.  Queen is also not a bad option.</li>  	<li>Normal summon Zohah and special Nunu with its own effect</li>  	<li>Overlay for King of the feral, activate effect for Nauya</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya send Keurse</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral Imps for Keurse, special Nauya and add Water Lily</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily, send either Aleirtt or Ogdoabyss here depending on what you did during step 2.  If you did not discard a tribute monster, send Aleirtt.  Special Ogdoabyss if possible</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, it will stay banished.</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li> </ol> <em><strong>Snake Rain open</strong></em>  There isn't really a specific snake rain combo , it's basically what you see above but better.  I will offer a tip though, don't just throw down snake rain.  Start going through some of these combos, activate Cursed Eldland if you have it, just try to draw out any Ash that may be lurking in your opponents hand, because ensuring Snake Rain resolves boosts your chances of winning significantly......obviously.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Eldlich Open</strong></em>  It's Eldlich, set traps and proceed to Monkee Flip.  One note though, it's a pretty small Eldlich package, there's no need to ever activate more than 1 Golden Land effect in EP, you're just making yourself more susceptible to back row removal.  ____  It's important to remember that a lot of these combos only require having 2 cards in hand, and bare minimum you only need 1.  It's very likely you open full Ogdoadic combo and will have access to the Golden Boy.  The boards may seem underwhelming but consistently ending on a board wipe before your opponent has even played a card is incredibly powerful, you have a chance to stop your opponents turn before it even started and give yourself all the momentum in the duel, and you will be able to do it 3 turns in a row minimum.  The amount of advantage you can generate with this deck is insane, and it will be put to good use.  Pure Advantage Snakes Munch all Noobs.  &nbsp;  Don't mind the side deck too much, you can very easily replace the Droplets with some Imperms, they're in the side currently because I don't have to pay 400 dollars for 3 cards in the side deck for a deck I've only played online.  Nibiru and Lancea are alternate Hand traps to consider, but Belle in the main deck is a must as it is your primary protection against banishing effects and other graveyard shenanigans your opponent might try.  &nbsp;  I have been playing this deck almost exclusively for 2 months and I believe this deck will be Meta, just not sure where exactly it will end up on a tier list, or if this <em><strong>exact</strong></em> list is the way to go.  Also an Eldlich deck so that allows me to say it's Meta apparently."

And now it is not long until the sequel comes, certainly longed for by many. ""A Quiet Place Part II"" was supposed to be released as early as March 2020, but became one of the first films to fall victim to covid-19 and closed cinemas. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/theconjuring3ita/comments/n69lg7/the_conjuring_per_ordine_del_diavolo_2021/</a>  Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family must now face the dangers of the outside world as they continue their struggle for survival in silence. When forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that respond to sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sandy path. Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy, Noah Jupe and Djimon Hiunsou play the lead roles. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/lucaita/comments/n68fk9/luca_streaming_ita/</a>  It may be too early to say that it's starting to become a trend, but soon a comedy film by Blue Fox Entertainment will premiere called ""Hero Mode"", which is also about a game studio. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ElConjuro3/comments/n6cc99/ver_el_conjuro_3_el_diablo_me_obligó_a_hacerlo/</a>  The film revolves around a struggling indie game studio, which is suddenly successful when the boss's teenage son, who is good at programming, is given responsibility for the development. However, this makes the already employed, including one played by Sean Astin (best known as Sam in the ""The Tale of the Ring"" movies), somewhat dissatisfied. <a>https://sites.google.com/view/conjuring3hebrew/home</a>  The film is directed and produced by the relatively unknown A.J. Tesler. In my opinion, it seems to have potential with its rather different premise, as long as the game theme does not feel glued or forced. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/Unhommeencolere/comments/n6fems/regarder_un_homme_en_colère_2021_streaming_vf/</a>"

Each time you summon another shining attack points for every shining will rise making it really strong. The other fusion heroes are if you can't do the combo so use them only if you need to. Favorite hero card will also further boost attack points. The whole deck is about making shining stronger. Also if you have both sunrise and another hero and you or you opponent attacks sunrise can destroy a card on the fiel,d use it to protect shining. If you want to exchange hero signal with another card, i recommend change of hero-reflector ray if you want more hero traps in the deck."

The best, but very inconsistent combo that deck allows is this.  If you get Malefic Stardust in you opening hand without Territory, and you have something else you'd rather play like a Malefic Rainbow or Cyber End, then ideally summon the stardust BEFORE bringing out Malefic World so that you can have a normal Stardust banished for Later.  (Worth noting that if you have a selector and are trying to get territory. but you nothing in your GY, summon Malefic monsters so you have banish fodder. Then bring out Territory and a Malefic of your choice)  Once you are able to get Territory out, use Malefic World's ability during your next draw phase to get Paradigm in your hand (if you can, use Malefic World to get selector instead so that you can get an extra card on top of Paradigm). Then summon Paradigm and activate his effect. By sending Paradox Gear to the Graveyard you can Get the regular Stardust back from your banish pile in addition to any other Malefics you have. This is a free negate to keep your beatsticks from being destroyed.  Against Synchro decks, make an effort to use Paradox Gear to get Paradox Dragon out, which you can use to steal a Synchro from their Graveyard."

Universal Studios has chosen to move the movie premiere of ""Fast &amp; Furious 9"" to April next year.  The cause is the coronavirus, which is spreading concern around the world, and is expected to have a major impact on bio-revenues in the near future. The Bond film ""No Time to Die"" was recently moved to November, and the thriller ""A Quiet Place Part II"" will be postponed indefinitely. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n74iua/retfærdighedens_ryttere/</a>  ""We all know the love and expectations for the next chapter in our saga. It is therefore especially difficult to tell that we have to move to the premiere. It has become clear that it will be impossible for all our fans around the world to see the film in May,"" comments Vin Diesel in social media. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/f9ukraine/comments/n720vt/фільм_форсаж_9_нестримна_сага_2021_онлайн/</a>  I think Cipher will be the enemy of the toretta in this part as well Statham and maybe his brother in the movie will be on the side of the team - they will continue to chase Cipher because as we know in the eighth installment she survived - Toretto has already destroyed her two teams so she won't let it go. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n75hlq/centervagt/</a>  I wonder about the role of Matt Damon - Today Tyrese Gibson announced on Facebook that Matt Damon will appear in the 9th part :)  <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n7jdcm/se_på_fast_furious_9/</a>  I also like Statham very much, thanks to him this series has gotten fresh, plus his lyrics for Hobbs and vice versa are great. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/fastandfurious9poland/comments/n7k97w/szybcy_i_wściekli_9_2021_cały_film_pl/</a>"

Dragunity remus is an extender which can also search a dragon ravine and it's a lvl. 2 tuner. With other words you have a 1 card crystal wing, which is also a card which let's you unbrick hands and it's a great follow-up play.</span>  <span>You only have to play 2 bricks in the deck which are legatus and baby roc, but that's completly fine, because even if you draw them they're not dead cards, legatus can be a free link/synchro material if dragon ravine is on the field and baby roc is a free discard for dragon ravine, so it actually doesn't matter. You could also play atum, dragunity glow, myseltain, and zephyros. The problem I have with them is that you would have to main deck more bricks just for a 2nd elpy and to loop gae daerg, which isn't worth it. </span>  <span>I also don't play red md just, because I never make him and don't even know why I would need him. The only 2 times I maked him was 1. I've bricked and had red md and a ns in hand, so I used him to go into romulus and the 2nd time I used him to get abyss back. With other words he is useless for me.</span>  <span>Another card I don't play is apollousa, just because I needed extra deck space for the gae daerg and crystal wing and I play saryuja instead, because 1. it is a dragon and remus locks you into dragons, 2. it can make you a better hand and 3. it can be used as a link material for spheres. </span>  <span>The last card I kicked was quadborrel, just because I don't have the space for that.</span>  <span>A card I would play is phantazmay, the thing is that I don't know what to cut for that, so if anyone has an idea let me know. :)</span>"

This archetype is lacking, but I try to make it work! And this is my first involved variant of the deck. This variant has every starter in the book, it can play through a bunch of interruptions, has the least potential to brick, and is my only deck where I used Diviner. However, it's also in my opinion the one with the least potential, and probably the least interesting to me, quite fun still however. HOW TO USE DIVINER normal Diviner-&gt;dump Trias Hierarchia (this is why we play it)-&gt;activate Hierarchia from grave to tribute Diviner-&gt;Special summon Hierarchia-&gt;Diviner activates-&gt;special summon Cutea from deck-&gt;search.. Plus two!! Granted you have to give your normal summon for this but it's nice, and it gives you virtually six copies of your main searcher, (as well as the where arf thous) if you don't need the Cutea, you are free to summon your TUNER herald of orange light, or Dreamea. EXPLAINING SOME TECH OPTIONS -One for one: why are you running this in a pendulum deck? +This is a very good card to go even by special summoning cutea and pitching one of your effect monster starters, because we have a lot of those in this deck, you can even pitch Trias Hierarchia if you open it, and still get the effect later, so most of the time you want to be using this on your effect monsters that can special summon -Lyrilusc - Recital Starling +You can get into this extremely easily in this, the main purpose of this is to get you a Pendulumucho, a scale 0, can be very useful, it's also a winged beast that can go into Simorgh, Pendulumucho can retreive the jackal you threw into the grave to get Magicians' Souls OR you can detach Cutea and get her back to your extra deck instead! -Odd-eyes Arc Pendulum +Target for Duelist Alliance when you need a high scale -Halqifibrax +Very flexible card, lets you go into Selene with Effect Veiler, you can side into Mist Valley Baby Roc so it turns into a Simorgh, go into Diviner and tribute it if you can, or sometimes even go into Borrelsavage, but you get the gist, very strong card, and just comes in handy when usually nothing else would work out as well GENERAL GAMEPLAN what you want to accomplish with this deck is play to your hand, try to get Cutea to get the plus off of her, try to get to your 0 scale, otherwise just set whatever you can, go into your link first, off of your easy special summons, then pendulum summon and get as many monsters on the field, then look at your extra deck for plays, because you won't be getting anything from your maindeck for a while. With this deck you need to focus on getting past the second turn, once you're in your third turn, you can dismantle their board and OTK, so it's fine to dump a lot of resources into your first board, as long as you don't die OR lose your scales and have no replacement.

And that's why we play 60 cards! As it ensures if you draw into one brick, you'll still have many options to play with The main point of this deck is to have as many starters as possible, and achieve heights you could only dream of with the previous list. However, this comes at the cost of consistency, so if you're more of a combo player who doesn't mind a few dead hands, and can think in 5 dimensions, this might be the list for you (provided you also wanna play Doremichords) <strong>EXPLAINING TECH OPTIONS(DIVINER AND OTHER OPTIONS' USES CAN BE FOUND IN THE FIRST VARIANT DECKLIST)</strong>  -<a data-name=""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"">Mythical Beast Master Cerberus </a>+This card Searches out Jackal king, Jackal king summons Cerberus, that's a free body (note that it summons it to an extra monster zone so you need to link using it) so after using this, you have a Jackal in extra deck to summon later, and a body to link with, pretty good. -<a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Guitaar"">Symphonic Warrior Guitaar</a> +This card special summons Miccs, which is a pendulum monster, that also lets you normal summon one more time in addition to your normal summon, and that's obviously very good in this normal summon heavy archetype, moreover it's a free body on the field, and doesn't use your normal summon either! You do have to discard with Guitaar to activate his effect, however, you can always just discard any bricks, or spells that won't make much of an impact/you wouldn't use. <strong>WHAT ARE THOSE TUNERS DOING THERE? </strong>Combo pieces, you'll get to see their use in the videos below. <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong> General gameplan with this deck is just, try to make the best board you can for turn 1, by using your amazing starters, getting free bodies on board, linking into Musesea, getting your scales, pendulum summoning using her effect to go very plus off of all of this, normal summoning if you still have that, making an apollousa and a Masquerena. or whatever else you can afford to go into, and surviving the next turn. After you're done surviving, Dismantle their board and OTK. <strong>BREAD AND BUTTER COMBOS </strong><span><strong><em>GENERIC COMBO</em></strong></span> <a>https://streamable.com/ny7zky</a>  <span><strong><em>3 CARD COMBO (note that they do not have to be those exact cards as long as you can get to them) </em></strong></span><a>https://streamable.com/5l80jz</a>"

Not a particularly strong deck, but a fun one nonetheless.  Fire Flint Lady (searchable with Durendal) and Jogen are both extenders, allowing you to normal summon any warrior type ninja and link into Isolde. Upstart Golden Ninja is a good but vulnerable starter, and it not being once per turn allows you to spam Hanzo and copies of itself from the deck with its own effect to spam monsters for XYZ/link plays, provided there are enough traps in your hand.  Isolde allows you to search Kagen with her first effect, letting you pendulum summon Twilight Ninja Getsuga to summon copies of Hanzo from the GY. Hanzo's ridiculous ability not being once per turn makes it possible to search every ninja card in the deck in one turn if your hand is decent.  Ninja Grandmaster Saizo allows you to set any ninjitsu art card from the deck, which can be used to draw cards via notebook into alchemy, set up a disruption or floodgate with the transformation cards into Amorphage Greed/Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, or just set the field spell and activate it to provide protection and recursion for the ninjas and ninjutsu arts.  The abundance of search effects makes it possible to bait handtraps from your opponent (although the deck is especially vulnerable at the beginning and dies hard to droll), and allows you to generate insane hand and field advantage, allowing you to link summon Saryuja with four monsters and extend into even more plays, as well as maintaining hand advantage.  The side deck includes other options to shut down other types of decks, with Anti-Spell Fragrance and Dark Simorgh in conjunction with each other allowing you to prevent your opponent from using spells and traps. It also contains a few going second cards, since this deck struggles in that department.  Overall a fun and somewhat quirky deck which is sure to surprise any unprepared opponent.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck brings together zombie world, Eldlich and some rather scary ","I like to use either doomking and uni-zombie or golden lord and uni-zombie into halq so that you can bring either of the boss monsters back the following turn with their effects. Then you go into halq, summon glow-up and link it out for linkuribo for glow-up blooms effect to activate in the graveyard to special summon a golden lord or doomking from deck. If conquistador is playable have it activated and ready to be used to synchro summon clear wing once halq has switched out to formula. This combo leaves you with a strong board full of negates and once doomking comes back in the next standby phase if zombie world is on the field, the board becomes almost unbreakable along side a number 23 and a 3500 atk golden lord.  Uni-zombie is pivotal for this deck, discarding the correct cards for the field you need can be orchestrated by this card.  You can summon geomathmech sigma with combo: halq into glow-up. Make sure to have golden lord on the field readily available. Next turn, activate halq into formula, chain both its effects and synchro sigma. For additional destruction, it's best to have guardian of the golden land activate in M1 to target an attack facing monster on the opponent's side of the field so that you can make their attack 0 and go into it with sigma for 6000 damage.  I hope you like my line-up, it mashes many boss monsters together in a convenient way I think. You have many choices and decisions to make when playing this deck, a quality I love. I am still looking to improve my deck and become a better player."

Let's talk about what it's trying to do.  __________________________________________________________________________  This deck wants to go first and flood the board. A sort of.. swarm. We're looking for stuff like Rescue Rabbit, Castor + lswarm, Singing Lanius, Mothman, and Brigandine to get level 4s on the board to XYZ into Force Strix. We almost always want to go Force Strix as our first XYZ to detach for 1) Singing Lanius if you didn't open it, or 2) Strangle if you did. We then want to use those to make Wise Strix to search out Mimicry (any other if you've already drawn it). A good hand will have another extender to let you go into a second Force Strix, pull/ summon Singing. Once you activate the second Force, Wise will draw you RU Soul Shave Force. Activate this to go into CD Infinity. (If you necessarily had to summon a Strangle before you cannot)  End Result?

If you've got Soul/Circle, probably the one that protects your back row. If you don't have that stuff, probably Dark Dragoon. If you're feeling foot-loose and fancy free, bring out the DM Girl Dragon fusion, for style points.

Going minus 2 on every summon, making handtraps hurt like a Kalut in Damage Step, I decided to let other people figure out how to steer the deck.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Until then I wanted to give Solfachords a chance. I never played Pendulum but I thought they'd fit in perfectly between my Lyrilusc and Marincess decks so I opened the Deck Constructor on DB and started constructing. Maybe it's my fault for playing them pure, maybe it's my fault for not watching enough Triff Gaming but gosh dang did they feel awful to play. They end on what, a </span><em><span lang=""EN-US"">reactive</span></em><span lang=""EN-US""> monster destruction and a targeted card negate? Not wanting to spend money on even more cards I've never got the hang of I dismissed Ancient Guardians as an overall bad product and simply looked forward to opening them together with some friends (In all conformity with the law! I think).</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">If you're wondering why I've already shared my earliest census without even talking about Ogdoadics that's because I thought they were the worst of the bunch. Having read ""Tribute 3 monsters;"" and the synergy between Kind and Queen with Light and Dark, everyone of which requiring even more tribute fodder, I thought they made Ursarctic's card disadvantage seem attractive.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">…Well I guess I was wrong. I mean, I was also right. Getting all of these monsters out by their own effect is awful and not how this deck's combo turned out but I'm glad that there's more to them because as I was opening pack after pack I realized just how gorgeous their design is. (Still a fan of Ursarctic's design, if anyone wants to make that deck good, be my guest)</span>  <span lang=""EN-US""> </span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">A new Invoked deck has awoken, as my credit card got revoked.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Sorry for the rhyming but it could be worse, I could write in Nickelback songs. </span><span lang=""EN-US"">The preferred engine has established itself very quickly. Ogdoadic's lack of a necessary Normal Summon to start their plays gives way to who's probably the most beloved and despised person in all of the Yugiverse, Aleister. But every Invocation comes with a price, quite literally (I </span><em><span lang=""EN-US"">just</span></em><span lang=""EN-US""> realized that you can play this deck with a single Invocation, making this not much more expensive that buying three Chaos Space). </span>So I decided to opt for some different engines.  The first one's are the Sacred Beasts. Not the Beasts themselves of course but their small little minions. All you need is <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> for an I:P and another monster to go into Apollousa or to use as tribute fodder for you snakes.  The other engine is the <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a> engine. Giving you two bodies and 2 cards in hand, one of which is a body for next turn is insane. You can either go into Sphere for an early interrupt on the board and a punish for Nibiru or, in case you drew both engines, you can go into Elpy and Pisty under Apollousa to go into Diabolos to handloop a card. Diabolos is also a level 8 for Dingu or Number 68, which singlehandedly can win you a game against decks that need to summon from the Graveyard. I'm thinking about ditching the Rikka engine to make space for Number 38 but we'll see.  &nbsp;  For now there's not much else to say. It's new, it's fun, it's something.

Salmangreats can easily make a rank 3 with gazelle or a link 3 with gazelle and salamangreat spinny. if you open no salamangreat traps you go for the phantom knight route and mill or send with Cherubini. If you open a salamangreat trap you try to make sunlight wolf and then make your pk plays if you are able to otherwise save it for next turn and set fog blade.  use discard cards such as card and hand destruction to help fix your hand as well as do it selectively.

The deck really full filled all the expactations I had of it and even more. Its a highly debatable version which rewards extending just a little further than usual while also having a hidden tool box with cards most people dont know / expact to see.  And while I know Back to duel ( https://imgur.com/a/Vz9opPZ )  is just some locals which can range from casual to competitive depending who attends, it still shows that the deck can win on a consitant basis, putting it not only on a even length with other versions like Dragunitymaids, Controlmaids or other versions. But also making it a strong contender against Dragonlink ( actually one of the best match ups for this deck ), can challenge any Shadoll version and is flexible enough to counter almost any rouge strat. Best part, you cant lose to mystic mine with this deck, its literall impossible.  A replay so you get an Idea : https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=447320-27026681  The replay isnt using the same list as I show a bit below, but it still shows the combo you want to do, so I will be lazy and keep it as example. Sue me : D  Now lets find something else to combo to. This time we focus on instead of not letting our opponent play, we will just make it so they cant interact with our cards and we throw as many stone in their way as possible. To make it simple I will copy my explantions for each card from the last list, just updated for all thats new.  Also remember, Laundry is the best Maid, even if she is the worst card.  Well I assume you are here to look at one of the endless versions of Dragonmaid decks. Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~ Also REMEMBER the targets once targeted dont need to stay on board to resolve. You can tar sphere, chain sphere and bounce 2 cards.  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free  Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time. Also its a 1 card I:P , allows you to do guardragon through hand traps and is always a combo saver / extender / starter.  1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice. ( Update : after maybe 50 games, the banish eff still never came up. Still a different name so we keep it)  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li> </ol> Dragons :  3 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  2 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With dragon link and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for super poly and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair.  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender. Or send Gram for another big body. Also cleans your hand of cards you dont want to have there  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Gram or Parlor  1 Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck.  1 Dragunity Gram : Lets not lie to each other. This card is just a Dragon Ruler in disguise, you cant fool us Gram. But we gladly welcome him as he is extender with a negate packed to it.  Hand traps : 3 Ash + Super poly/ Nibiru . Super poly is king in this deck as we can also use it during the BP to get a bit more damage on board, while it also just ruins dragonlinks day, and annoys shadoll / invoked to no compare.  Extra :  1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.  2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more  1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid  1x Titanclad the Ashdragon : Summon of Albaz to remove a boss monster or if its send by maximus to get you a free albaz to combo with / fusion into venom dragon  1x Starving Venom Dragon : Its a awesome super poly / fallen of Albaz target. While also a threat to the board right after being summoned.  1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones  1x Pitsy and Elpy : The extender dragons which hopefully get banned soon. Usually made with Nurse + any maid  1x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon + 1 card out to dragoon  1x I:p  : We need her to link summon in the opponents turn + she is dark so rokket is a 1 card combo to her  1x Trishula : Not to sure if we keep him around. Its a nice fusion target, it gives us a free search and lets us take our opponents good cards away. Also it gives the guardragons a good use if we dont go for five head. You can exchange him for another Pitsy if you want, which would be live under five head.  1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards  1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle  1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.  &nbsp;  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on  Borrel Savage + I:P + Five headed link dragon + Sheou = I:P + the maids summoned by Shoeu go into the new Link 5 and steal another Monster from the opponent  Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou  or if we eat to many hand traps, just a classic Sphere + Sheou  &nbsp;  Afterwords : I am happy with how this deck developed over the past weeks and I think its close to being as good as this version can be. The deck rewards you for making decisions in either players turn while also having straight goals which you play towards. But in the end the best part of this deck is, having your opponents scoop instantly after playing five head / no fully realizing how immun it is / not wanting to belive what they read for a moment, while than seeing that they are now on the glock to out this thing or lose.  I think in all my games only 1-2 Persons were able to win after it was summoned. One was just stalling until I ran out of cards to banish other was a Kaiju top deck. So its still a good average of staying and winning you the game.  &nbsp;  And thats my crap guide to Dragonmaid, you welcome.  &nbsp;"

Let me tell you that Toons can and are very deceiving. While it's not a top-tier meta deck Toons are unpredictable and you can often pull out surprising results.</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">I'll go over all the cards in the deck and why we play them</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">FAQs at the bottom</span></strong> <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">T</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">oon Ancient Gear Golem&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">- A worse version of Toon BLS in every way so why do we run it you might ask? I like to go into rank 8 XYZ monsters quite often so having a different level 8 monsters to search out with Toon Page-Flip makes it easier. But like I said it's a worse Toon BLS so we run an extra in the side deck so you can switch it out if not needed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">0-1 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Black Luster Soldier&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">- The BEST card in the deck maybe besides Toon Dark Magician. Can attack the same turn it's summoned(which is only toon card able to do so). Can be special summoned from the hand by sending cards to the grave in the hand or field whose level is 8 or more. So you could bring this card out the first turn if you wanted to. Also can banish any card on the field at the cost of not being able to attack that turn&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">2-3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Dark Magician</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Another card that can be considered the best card in the deck. By discarding one Toon card you can special summon ANY Toon monster from the deck except itself (great for comboing with Red Eyes). Also instead of special summoning, you can add any Toon spell/trap to your hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Lets you special summon any Toon monster from the hand. Easy to bring out with Black Stone of Legend or Toon Dark Magician.

It's an old Class A toon monster though so besides going into Bahamut Shark or using it as tribute fodder(If you have to do that) it's sort of useless but, it's a free summon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">2-3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Toon Harpie Lady</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Another card that can be special summoned from the hand plus the bonus of destroying a spell/trap card if you control another Toon Monster.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">3 Copies</span></strong> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">The Black Stone of Legend</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;- Lets you bring out a Toon Red-Eyes from the deck which in turn lets you special summon another Toon from the Hand.

You almost always can get Toon Kingdom on the first turn so that gives all you Toons protection. It also lets you set up your amazing traps. Going second does have its benefits like being able to Comic Hand your opponent's boss monster for an OTK but overall I would say&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">First</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Are Toons Bad?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;Before the support yes but after...mostly yes.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Should I Attack Directly?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;I do most of the time. Unless your opponent has an obvious combo piece of the field. Don't forget about BLS's banish too.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">When To Go Into Extra Deck Monsters?</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;For the most part, you aren't unless you can OTK with Number 100. Being able to attack directly every turn will hurt any deck but that doesn't mean it isn't there. The extra deck is mainly for protection so use it when needed.</span> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">How to deal with MTS/Cosmic Vortex/Harpies</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">Duster?&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">I'll be real with you for a second, your Toon World WILL be destroyed a lot. But, unlike old toon decks at least your monsters don't get destroyed. You can only try and prevent this by getting as many Toon Bookmark's in the grave as possible so always go TToC-&gt;Toon Bookmark-&gt;Desired Card.</span></p>"

I do not own the deck nor am I the person who made this variant! I simply enjoy this variant and tweaked with the ratios a little bit.</strong>  The original video:<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sasLW7AenE</a>  Hello everyone! Dig Benis here, and today, I come at you with a <em>heavily </em>unexplored variant of Ogdoadic which I feel needs a little bit of love. To sum up what this description is going to be, it essentially will tell you which version is better (with a little bias), one of it's combos, and of course the meaning of the engines played (as I'm a little too lazy to give a reason for every card in the deck), one more thing is in the end, I will suggest some cards you could play otherwise in the overall deck. And now, without further ado, lets start. <p><strong>The Combo</strong></p>       So to start off, we will start with the combo. This combo will be a copy of <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare and a copy of Snake Rain. To start this off we will activate Snake Rain to go ahead and discard the copy of Knightmare to pitch Aleirtt, Keurse,  Nunu, and Nauya.</a> Then, with the effect of Nunu (since we control no monsters) we can special summon it. Then we will summon Keurse from the graveyard by tributing the Nunu (causing it to be banished via it's effect) and activating it's effect to bring back Nauya from the graveyard, which will use it's effect on summon to search for Water Lily from the deck. Next we will use Knightmare's effect to banish itself to send a copy of World Wand to the graveyard (the target doesn't matter, as we are going first and aiming to link away the monsters on field as of right now. And now we shall use World Wand to banish itself to bring back Knightmare. Next we will use Nauya and Knightmare for the summon of Galatea (Nauya will be banished because of Keurse), who will use her effect to shuffle away the World Wand to be able to set a copy of the field spell, Orcustrated Babel, from the deck to the field zone. We will (of course) activate the field spell, which will allow us to have a decent amount of disruption in the graveyard, which will bypass any Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Droplets thrown at our board at the end of the combo. Now, using Galatea, we will be able to make Dingirsu without properly Xyz summoning it, and then tribute it for the summon of Aleirtt. Now we will use the effect of Aleirtt to return the banished cards into our graveyard, further putting more utility into the graveyard. Then you would either link them into an I:P or a Verte Anaconda. The Dragoon package is something I will further elaborate on later during the deck description. Now, to label the disruptions, we have Knightmare to send Skeleton, then Skeleton to revive Ding to non target <strong>send </strong>to the graveyard, which means any monster that either has protection from targeting or destruction, will just be sent. Making this a better board than the Invoked board (also more of that later on). Now, even if they out the board and we manage to survive, our follow up play is to activate the Water Lily we searched earlier in the combo, to send and special the Ogdoabyss Overlord man to nuke the board, which is nice, and in addition to that, we can do the plays with the snakes that we did earlier, again. Since Nunu can special itself even if we have a reptile on the board as opposed to the no monsters on the board.  &nbsp; <p><strong>The Comparisons and the Explanations</strong></p> &nbsp;  Now, we begin our next section. The comparisons. Now, we will be comparing this variant to the other two that have solidified itself. Invoked Ogdoadic, and the Ogdoadic FTK. Now right off the bat I can say without any hesitance that this variant is better than the FTK variant, as it is a deck that works game one, won't succeed in games two and three, as this deck has so many choke points, it's not funny. Another thing to bring up is how easy it is to disrupt the FTK since it's, well, and FTK. Next is a slightly harder comparison, the Invoked Ogdoadic version of the deck, I can say that it is better, since it provides the same follow up play, but better forms of disruption before, and it's semi-immunity to DRNM and Forbidden Drip. While anything with the Invoked engine is at least tier 3, it's just not that good, seeing as they also have a normal summon they could disrupt. And the combo we perform doesn't need a normal summon (something I just realized as I'm typing this bit). Anyway, lets move on the engines of this deck. <p><em>Orcust</em></p> I decided to play the Orcust engine for it's synergy with using the graveyard with the serpents. I also favor this engine as it allows us to have somewhat less linear plays than the other variants, and they provide disruption that although is weak to things such as D.D. Crow and Lancea, can be helpful when your board eats a going second card such as DRNM or Forbidden Drip. Overall, I like this engine a lot and definitely recommend this to any Ogdoadic player to try out. <p><em>Ogdoadic</em></p> I chose this engine to mix with Orcust as, stated before, the archetypes have synergy with themselves, seeing as both of them provide their plays in the graveyard, and are less linear than most strategies in my opinion. They have a fun boss monster that can nuke the board and are the first competent reptile archetype to take advantage of Snake Rain. <p><em>Shaddoll</em></p> <p>I played the Shaddoll package as a way for this deck to play going second, as this deck isn't always guaranteed to go first (unless you're a god at winning the dice roll, in that case, teach me your ways) and provides neat interactions. Shaddoll Fusion is just a great card as it lets you send from deck to fulfill a fusion summon if your opponent controls a face up monster from the extra deck, something almost every deck in Yu-Gi-Oh usually ends on. Genius and Dragon are neat as well as since they were sent off of Fusion, which happens to be by card effect, they can negate the effects of a face up monster on their side (though if you play that card in this deck, then you better plan on making something else) and to pop a spell/trap on the field. The fusion you would be making is Apkallone, which has the effect to negate a face up <em>card </em>on the field, which can be helpful in some instances. Overall, I can say this engine has done me well, though you could possibly brick on the Shaddolls sometimes.</p> &nbsp; <p><strong>The Alternative Options</strong></p> This will tell you alternatives for the cards throughout the deck (Main, Side, and Extra)  &nbsp;  Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight - Dark Grepher, Armageddon Knight, Reinforcement of the Army  I would recommend this as a budget alternative to this card, as these cards provide a similar role to it, that being the ability to access the normal summon that can send Orcust monsters from the deck to the graveyard. They do provide a better utility as with Dark Grepher can get rid of cards from your hand to provide a decent trade off. Armageddon Knight simply just sends a DARK monster from deck to grave, sweet and simple. Reinforcement of the Army allows you to add one of these cards from your deck to hand.  &nbsp;  Forbidden Droplets - Dark Ruler No More  Dark Ruler does provide the same role as Droplets, though at the disadvantage due to you not being able to inflict damage after the card resolves, while Droplet sends cards from your hand to graveyard, which in this deck is super useful, since you want more cards in graveyards.  &nbsp;  Accesscode Talker - Topologic Zeroboros  Zeroboros can provide a neat little disruption, the ability to banish the entire board. Something that Accesscode can't do. And its like Dingirsu and how it doesn't target or destroy anything, this time a little stronger as nothing hits the graveyard either. I genuinely wonder why this card hasn't been seeing play in a myriad of different decks for it's useful boardwipe-esque effect. It also can bring itself back in the following Standby Phase, and it gains attack for each banished card (x200) and starts off with a 3k body, which isn't even that bad.  &nbsp;  Lightning Storm - Cosmic Cyclone, Twin Twisters, Harpie's Feather Duster, Hey Trunade!  They all remove backrow, Cosmic requires you to pay life points but it banishes the card instead of sending it to graveyard, therefore acting as a one for one. Twin Twisters can act as a two for two, requiring a discard (which this deck will take any day of the week) and hits two backrow, though they do go to the graveyard. Harpie's Feather Duster is the second effect of Lightning Storm and just destroys all backrow from your opponent's side of the board. Hey Trunade is my preferred pick as it bounces all set spells and traps to hand, easily winning you many backrow heavy matchups like Eldlich and Paleofrog. Unless they have the Solemn Judgement (every game I used this card, they have a Judgement...).  &nbsp;  I:P, Unicorn, 2 Allures, and one Super Poly - Dragoon package  I don't like the Dragoon package in this deck, but you can run this if you want to make life harder for you to create the entire deck. This is more of a Budgetless Alternative as the package costs more than the cards it replaces. There is nothing really to say about this, since Dragoon is a towers negate that gains 1k each time it negates something, discards (something this deck is very fond of), and burns your opponent going second. Verte easily makes this at the cost of 2k life points and two monsters. Overall, don't be a meanie and play this engine.  &nbsp; <p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p> <p>I would like to round out this deck with a question, a poll at the end if you will. The question being, What is your favorite version of a deck that you feel is unexplored and less recognized than the others? Any constructive criticism would be nice in the comments below.</p> Now on the overall deck, it could be better. It might not be the best variant in everyone's eyes, but I can see this variant peeping through the cracks of rouge and making a splash there. The consistency of the deck may be weaker than the Invoked variant but the end result of this combo it can pull off regularly is fantastic. I give this deck an 8.5/10, as it does have choke points, and loses against most graveyard disruptions (Crow, Abyss Dweller) and Lancea. Anyway, I think I have had your attention for a good enough portion of your day. Comment below what you might want to see me profile, and until next time.  &nbsp; <p><em>Arriverderci~</em></p>"

I decided to write out a detailed deck description for this one because most of you here are new to the deck and this is not the typical Ogdoadic deck profile. This is inspired off of 2 second place lists (from remote duels) and they both used the Chaos Engine as well!! The chaos engine is a great addition to this deck because they add versatility, consistency and card advantage to the overall deck. For example, you would normally need to open snake rain or nunu to combo but opening Aliester + Space OR white dragon OR black dragon can get you to freal imps which can search out your nunu!! The synergy is just amazing if you ask me. The main goal of a typical Invoked Ogdoadic list is to turbo out Mechaba and as many negates as possible (Including Ogdoabhyss, the boss monster) but this is not your typical Ogdoadic list!! This list focuses on getting out Caliga to the field (VFD basically) and protecting it with things like Dingirsu (protects it from being destroyed by literally anything) and Dragoon (do I even have to say anything here??). All the topping lists have been running Caliga. The basic combo (so many ways to do this, check my youtube video for more details) ends on Dingirsu + Dragoon + Caliga and also has Aliester in hand and the entire GY set up for next turn!! It’s also only a 2 card combo, making it more consistent and easy to achieve. I really hope you enjoy and let's dive right in!!</span>  <a> </a>  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, deck explanation and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video.

To protect yourself you now xyz summon Tornado Dragon and Zoodiac Chackanine, and then xyz summon Number F0: Utopic Future, and then stack Future Utopic Dragon on top of it.

This is just WIND-Salamangreat lol","https://youtu.be/bj0jAyXu8UY  Insane Speedroid support from Duelists of Whirlwind, arguably makes the deck similar to Salamangreat while having more toolboxes. We're aiming to summon the new lv3 Speedroid synchro-tuner either for synchro climbing or searching trap. The combo and duel is in the video below. If we start from link2 Rubber Band Shooter, we banish lv6 or 7 synchro depends on which line can guarantee a synchro (pay attention if we already use Taketomborg too). Also why we dont run more Car-Turbo because it conflicts with the new lv3 synchro (both tuner) and it can only be a starter for the link2 (a choke point and vulnerable to Nibiru). We dont dun the double Crystal Wing strategy because it dies to a Zeus, we'd rather have Clear Wing Fast or the trap.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

Thanks everyone for giving me so much support and help, I know we all had a bumpy ride together so far, like beating the world record on deck comments, having to wait out for WAY too long for that speedroid support (at least it didn’t disappoint), watching the whole meta change with just 3 hits in one banlist, and seeing reptiles finally becoming good! </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I’ve improved so much sense I joined this site and it’s great to be able to talk yugioh with others! Where I live no one around here likes yugioh except me, screw that we don’t even have a locals! So I though loving the game I never really got to talk about it with others. Being here means a lot to me and honestly I’m really happy to have made this account.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Alrighty, enough with the emotional stuff, let’s get down to the important thing here: the deck and the combo.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Miscellaneous</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I play this card purely to have quick access to booster raptor as a free bonus body, I’m just a big sucker for anything that can SS in a deck so this got three slots.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Atlantean dragoons</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Atlantean dragoons got three slots for being a vital part of the one card combo this deck comes with, its for searching screw serpent, to make sure I’m safe if I open one (because if I had 2 it wouldn’t work at all) I play 3.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Screw Serpent</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">T.G. Screw Serpent got three slots for being one of the best cards T.G. has to offer, your going to search this card with Atlantean Dragoons in your main combo. Coming with a monster reborn effect and it’s releveling this monster is absolutely crucial to play at 3 in a T.G. deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Deep Sea Minstrel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Deep Sea Ministrel is only here for the nibru safety and for the fact that I can spare it during my one card combo.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Warwolf </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Warwolf is one of the original monsters T.G. has, it provides free access to an extra body and it can chain block negates to help keep your plays going so it’s 3 slots.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Metal Skeleton</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Metal Skeleton got a slot for its graveyard effect to layer protection and nothing else, other than the graveyard effect it’s really just a brick so I don’t like playing any more than one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Dragon Cannon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Come on, we always have to have dragons, I mean this is yugioh, right? Seriously though, this monster is an extender that I can’t do without, it’s also a soft OPT so you can do it’s effect twice or even more! Otherwise though I really don’t like playing more than two.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Striker</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the original T.G. Monsters! Striker has always been a 3 of in T.G. decks, even these days people run 3 striker and no less!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Deep Sea Diva</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now this is the starter of the one card combo in the deck, opening diva means a two layers of protection Halberd Cannon. Because it’s just that good!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is at two of in case you open it and Striker, or it and Diva, so that way you can still proceed with the combo as normal.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Gear Zombie</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I play 2 of this card because it’s a free tuner, I might’ve played more but space issues came up and you that already have plenty of tuners to work with.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Booster Raptor</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another one of the older T.G. monsters! Miscellaneous gets played at 3 for this card so I also gave it 3 slots.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Drill Fish</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Drill Fish is simply a free body, it’s piercing damage effect is just an added bonus.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Cyber Magician</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cyber Magician is an important card to play in case you can’t swarm enough but it also clogs a little so I only recommend playing one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Tank Grub</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is like Tech Genius’s idea of O’Lion (RIP) and is an important piece to the main combo of the deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Deep Sea Aria</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Purely to search Deep Sea Diva, no other reason I would even play this card</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 One for One</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One for One gives you access to summon half of your deck, so why not play it?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Reinforcement of the Army</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is purely to search striker, nothing else.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Halberd Cannon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The main combo in the deck can one card this monster out, which is one of the trickiest things in the game. Halberd Cannon is able to monster negate and has a floating effect as well on a 4K beater that’s already getting 2 layers of protection on average.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Shooting Star Dragon T.G. EX</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Shooting Star Dragon is the floated monster for Halberd cannon, you’ll find it really useful for its protection and self revival in the grind game.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Baroness De Fleur</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Baroness is a negate who can recycle and summon monsters from the graveyard. It’s a great synchro monster in general and it definitely is worth playing in decks like this one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Borreload Savage Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Savage Dragon is a twin negate with halq going to your graveyard extremely often, you can also use it on Trident Launcher too but that doesn’t come up as often.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Deep Sea Prima Donna</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Prima Donna is a monster that can summon a water monster from your deck, it’s useful then your playing the deep sea engine in a synchro heavy deck.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Hyper Librarian</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Hyper Librarian’s constant draws is what made synchron so good in terms of card advantage I’d play more of him but you’re only allowed one per deck because it’s that good, so I’ll take what I can get (I mean, if you had three out then every time you summoned a synchro you would draw three, which can get you access to another synchro).</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Power Gladiator</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Power Gladiator is only here because I needed a level five non tuner T.G. Synchro for the main combo, and I felt that I couldn’t afford to use Hyper Librarian when I could use it in other combos and not needlessly send it to the graveyard.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Star Guardian</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Star Guardian is a really good T.G. card in general acting as an extender in form of what is essentially a monster reborn, I couldn’t go without it and it’s used in the main combo as well.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Martial Metal Marcher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Metal Marcher is only here to extend, it stepping stones you with Hyper Librarian and gives you more tuners to work with.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Recipro Dragonfly</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dragonfly helps you get the Shooting Star float set up and it’s level is vital to summoning Halberd Cannon.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Formula Synchron</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Formula Synchron is a free draw on summon and a synchro tuner which I need for certain things so I couldn’t turn it down.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The sheer amount of level ones and their self summons led me to play this card to be able to solidify my position on the field for a ton of bounces.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Trident Launcher</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The T.G. link monster, Trident Launcher is an essential card to play in any proper T.G. deck these days for being able to do a mecha phantom beast auradon. Summoning a T.G. each from the graveyard, hand, and deck! And to top it off, T.G. synchros it points to become untargetable by opponents card! In my opinion this is the best T.G. card in the game and I will stand by it. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Crystron Halqifibrax </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Halq is played in so many different decks it’s amazing! It’s a great extender and really helps me out in my combo.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So I keep mentioning a combo, time to explain. This deck has a one card combo to summon T.G. Halberd Cannon pointed by Trident Launcher with Shooting Star Dragon and Metal Skeleton in the graveyard! Want to know how? I’ll be explaining the T.G. one card combo I discovered on my own down below.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So T.G. isn’t exactly linear by any means. Its really just work with what you opened in your hand. Trident Launcher requiring a T.G. to be present in your hand makes T.G. comboing that much harder as well, but pulling off a good Trident Launcher can take you a long way, even going as far as summoning Halberd Cannon! I just found that Deep Sea Diva can help you set up EVERYTHING for a perfect Trident Launcher. And the only reason why this works is because Screw Serpent was made as a Sea Serpent. Ready for the combo? Okay, let’s go.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Normal summon Deep Sea Diva</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Diva’s effect to summon Neptabyss</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Neptabyss to mill Atlantean Dragoons and add another one to your hand</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first Dragoon searches Deep Sea Ministrel</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Send Ministrel and Dragoon to your graveyard to rip a card out of your opponent’s hand</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your second Dragoon can search T.G. Screw Serpent</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Link Diva and Neptabyss to Halqifibrax</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Halqifibrax summons T.G. Tank Grub</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Link Halqifibrax and Tank Grub to summon Trident Launcher (here’s where things start getting sweaty)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Trident Launcher’s effect to summon the Screw Serpent in your hand, the Tank Grub in your graveyard, and hopefully the Metal Skeleton that may or may not be in your deck. (If your Metal Skeleton is in your in your hand summon a Screw Serpent from your deck and the Metal Skeleton in your hand)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(Little note in case you get confused by the next part: Tank Grub can be treated as a non tuner for the synchro summon of a T.G. monster) </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune Tank Grub with Screw Serpent to summon Star Guardian.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Star Guardian and Tank Grub’s effects to summon a token and recycle Screw Serpent to your hand.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Star Guardian’s effect to summon Screw Serpent from your hand</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Screw Serpent’s effect revives Tank Grub</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune the T.G. token provided by Tank Grub with Screw Serpent to summon Power Gladiator</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Using Screw Serpent’s second effect relevel Metal Skeleton to one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune the newly level one Metal Skeleton with Tank Grub for Recipro Dragonfly</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune Power Gladiator with Star Guardian for Shooting Star Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Recipro Dragonfly’s special ability to send Shooting Star Dragon to the graveyard and summon all synchro monsters that were used for its synchro summon, like Star Guardian and Power Gladiator for example</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now Star Guardian tunes Power Gladiator and Recipro Dragonfly to summon Halberd Cannon to a zone Trident Launcher points to!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Trident Launcher protects Halberd Cannon from being targeted by your opponents effects and the Metal Skeleton in your graveyard can save it once from being destroyed as well! Then if they still manage to top it you can float Shooting Star Dragon from your graveyard! It’s a pretty powerful setup but it only has one negate sadly. That being said Halberd Cannon is extremely tricky to summon manually so one carding it is quite impressive!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thanks again for looking at this build and I’ll see you next time!</span></p>"

It's not competitive but can be good fun. It's a grindy deck that does not win on turn 1.,"The goal is to go second with this deck.  All the ursarctic cards can be used on the opponent's turn but keep in mind that the level 8 effects only trigger when there is already an Ursactic on the field. Try to get any level 7 out first, but preferably Mikpolar as he searches any other Ursactic monster.  Level 7: Mikbilis SS another Ursactic from hand; Mikpolar searches the deck for an Ursactic monster; Miktanus recycles an Ursactic monster from the GY, this includes the synchro monsters!  Level 8: Megabilis banishes from GY; Megapolar destroys spell/trap; Megatanus flips a monster to face down defense position.  Use the Kaiju's as tribute fodder for the Ursactic. Ofcourse you can use them to get tribute an opponent's monster if needed.  The Melffy Catty can SS itself during your endfase. During the opponent's turn you can use it's effect to bounce to the hand to search a level 7 Ursactic monster to keep the combo's going.  Since there are no normal summons in the Ursactic line up, you can use Windwitch: Snow Bell to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon with any level 7 Ursactic Synchro monster after you used their effects. Snow Bell gives Crystal Wing an added layer of protection. I prefer going into Grand Chariot to pop two cards, then synchro into Crystal Wing or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi.  Yokotuner is your other possible normal summon. This card lets you SS any other tuner from the hand or GY, this means your Windwitch or any level 8 Ursactic monster.  Interrupted Kaiju Slumber is a ""get out of jail card"" when the enemy board is overwhelming you. Same for Raigeki.  Ursactic Departure is great to get the cards you need into your hand. Ursactic Slider lets you SS an Ursactic monster so you can SS a synchro, synchro it off or use it as tribute fodder.  Ursactic Big Dipper lets you tribute an Ursactic monster from the GY once per turn instead of from the hand. The 7 counter effect can come up but this doesn't happen very often.  The trap let's you pay 700 life points to bring an Ursactic from the GY to the hand during your turn and during your opponent's turn. Use this to recycle your synchro Ursactic monsters and to keep the combo's and interruption going. It also let's you SS an Ursactic monster during the opponent's turn if you have a lvl 7 and lvl 8 Ursactic monster on the field. If your Ursactic synchro is destroyed by battle while the trap is face up, you can let the opponent shuffle cards into the deck so they have 7 cards combined in their hand, GY and on their field.  &nbsp;  <span>Extra deck</span>  If you summon with Yokotuner you can go into a link play (I:P Masquerena/Knightmare Pheonix) before you start combo'ing with the Ursactic cards. This can give you an Accesscode Talker/Knightmare Unicorn on the opponents turn with a possible Borreload Savage with 2+ negates during your turn after that.  Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Draco Berserker of the Tenyi for the negates.  Number 38 Hope Harbinger if you have two level 8 Ursactics and haven't used their effects."

World Legacy will allow you to cheat out a 9 star in hand, or 2 of them temporarily. If you cheat out 2, they will die at the end of the turn, so XYZ them ideally for Jorm.  Jorm + Harr = Enemies Conceding. DO NOT USE JORM ON DRAW STEP! Jorm makes them draw, and then feed him. Their draw triggers Stage and Harr. You get another Generaider and they discard a card.  Keep THEIR stuff in Jorm's belly, detach YOUR stuff back to your grave.  Utgarda is so much fun... for you.  When all of the above isn't enough: Kaiju Raigeki Feather Super-Poly Slumber Droplet Phantom Infinitrack Zeus them until they have nothing left. Leave NOTHING standing.  The desperation move: When you can't find Boss Stage, tribute Loptr for Mardel and pull it out of your deck. Loptr and Boss Stage are the key to your deck, but Stage is more important because it will get Loptr again.  Remember Boss Fight works, but it does give your opponent +1 card, and should be used ideally with a Harr on the board to cancel that out. (Which you can achieve pre-Boss Stage with World Legacy.)  Hela is for the long games where you need to get back your Bosses that have died. Hela cannot get back a Hela, so try to keep her alive to keep your recursion going.  I don't run hand traps because I play with friends. They are in the sideboard should you be looking to tweak the deck to your liking.  The extra deck consists of 5 Super Poly targets, 5 XYZ's, and 5 empty slots for your own favorite techs.  &nbsp;  TLDR: Stage get Loptr and Fairy Tokens.  Loptr kill Fairy Token for a boss.  Boss kill Fairy Tokens for value.  Win Game.  &nbsp;  Manual: (Ideally you tribute Fairy Generaider Tokens)  <strong>Stage</strong>: Get a Generaider when <strong>opponent draws</strong>. Make fairies on <strong>opponents turn</strong>.  <strong>Loptr</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to get a Generaider from <strong>Deck</strong>.  <strong>Hela</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to get a Generaider from <strong>GY</strong>.  <strong>Dovelgus</strong>: <strong>Tribute X</strong> to get X Generaiders from <strong>Hand</strong>.  <strong>Harr</strong>: <strong>Tribute 2</strong> to <strong>Negate and Destroy</strong> anything. (Also enemy discards 1 if they draw 1.)  <strong>Utgarda</strong>: <strong>Tribute 2</strong> to <strong>Banish</strong> something.  <strong>Nidhogg</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to negate and destroy a ""Special Summon""...? I dunno...  <strong>Mardel</strong>: <strong>Draw Boss Stage</strong>.  <strong>Trias</strong>: <strong>Tribute 3 Fairies (Specifically)</strong> to <strong>Destroy 1 and Draw 2</strong>. (<strong>Can be activated from GY</strong>.)  <strong>Jorm</strong>: <strong>Detach 1</strong> to make each player draw 1, then attach 1 back to him. <strong>EMBIGGEN! FACE!</strong>  <strong>Fortress</strong>: <strong>Detach 1</strong> to <strong>Banish</strong>.  <strong>Infinitrack</strong>: <strong>Detach X</strong> to <strong>Destroy X</strong>.  <strong>Dyson</strong>: To go under the few decks that are bigger than you.  <strong>Zeus</strong>: <strong>Destroy everything</strong>.  &nbsp;"

The larger aim of the deck is to make konami print more ojama playable's. What the deck does (on a good day) is follows.  A) Our plan B mostly ends up becoming plan A... summon dragoon.    ~I'm sorry.  B) Using the ojama engine to link climb into interactive boards, giving you some things to think about when your turn is over. If you consider the movement of cards from deck to hand; hand to field; field to GY; GY to banished; banished to deck. This looping of material is what *imo* should be the high focus of ojamas, as they feel most comfortable flowing in that circular motion creating the fuel for your plays.  C) Use blowout cards like ABC, Master of Beats, Underworld Goddess, Borrelsword and uhhhh. *cough*dragoon.... to simply win games you had no right winning!  &nbsp;  Enjoy the deck, make sure to take deliberate care when making your chain orders. Maintaining advantage with this deck just wont be possible if you dont resolve your desired effects in the most optimum order &lt;3  Good luck, Have fun!  &nbsp;  (P.S please use I:P Masquerena and ojama duo together, it just works.)"

As quantidades e tipos de cartas escolhidas foram inspiradas em outros Decks Iniciais, como os de Yugi e Kaiba. Como se trata de um Deck Inicial, ele costuma ser bem fraco em relação a monstros e estratégia, mas possui magias e armadilhas poderosas para dar suporte. Usei como referência cartas lançadas até dezembro de 2005, seja no TCG ou no OCG. Algumas cartas do deck nunca foram lançadas oficialmente para TCG.

Normally its possible to do all except Knightmare gryphon 9 out of 10 hands.  First, have lv4 monsters on the field to summon dugares, this will give you resources. Keep using ur dangers to bring out cards, if you for some reason, need to discard magic cards to increase the chance of summoning the danger do it. Keep drawing cards, use the allure on snowws or dogmans, if u cannot use it on repeated danger in the hand, in that priority order. Once you have 4 monsters, summon apollusa, then keep trying to have as many lv8 monsters as possible.  Once you have 2 lv 8, summon lancelot, activate any danger in the hand, that will cancel it and it will provide new resource in the graveyard. then, summon draglubion. Then felgrand if possible, at this point you probably have spell fragance set.  Life aint that easy always, so if u thing u are running our of resources when u are about to summon apollusa, then summon skull dread instead to keep the combo running. Same with daigusto emeral. If you need resources in the graveyard use the links that u have in the disposal, with/without activating its effects when needed (remember, Dark world does not activate on cost). Also use the Danger! reponse team on ur own monsters to keep the combo flowing.  Requires practice, but is extremely consitent.  If you want to OTK, just summon Number 100 with dragublion, activate the effect and win."

With Shirokunishi's effect, you're able to banish a card from your opponent's field even during their turn. This quick effect once per turn combo can help with disrupting enemy combos.  I had created this deck in hopes that it could serve as a guide to future Karakuri Archetype players who would want to try out the Karakuri Archetype.  There are many cards that can be replaced in this deck build if you'd like to do so, these following cards are easily replaceable if you wish to run different cards in the deck: <ul>  	<li>Karakuri Strategist mdl 248 ""Nishipachi"" <ul>  	<li>From my experience the bare minimum is just 2 copies of this card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Karakuri Watchdog mdl 313 ""Saizan"" <ul>  	<li>From my experience the bare minimum is 1 copy of this card.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Karakuri Bushi mdl 6318 ""Muzanichiha"" <ul>  	<li>I mostly use this card as a Level 4 Non-Tuner Fodder.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Karakuri Soldier mdl 236 ""Nisamu"" <ul>  	<li>Another card that I use as a Level 4 Non-Tuner Fodder, but this card does help extend combat if you're up against a deck that relies on attacking monsters, allowing you to stall 3 attacks by summoning itself from the graveyard when it gets destroyed by battle and sent to the graveyard until you run out its copies.</li>  	<li>Keep in mind that you can still summon other Karakuri monsters using Nisamu, I sometimes summon Nishipachi from my Deck using Nisamu's effect and change the battle position of the final monster if the opponent has 3 - 4 Monsters on their field, allowing you to start your turn with a Tuner provided Nishipachi doesn't get destroyed.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Karakuri Anatomy <ul>  	<li>A nice card that can help increase draw power.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>De-Synchro <ul>  	<li>This is mostly a card that enables you to extend your combo. Keep in mind that if you revive a monster from the graveyard that was used as a synchro material for a synchro monster on your field, you will be unable to bring back the synchro materials of the synchro summoned monster even if they're back in the graveyard.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Iron Call <ul>  	<li>This is mostly a card that enables you to extend your combo.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Night Beam <ul>  	<li>This card is mostly for Backrow if you ever run into a deck with backrow.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  This deck also has a one card setup that would allow you to summon Bureibu on the field and put 2 Shirokunishis in your graveyard: <ol>  	<li>Summon Karakuri Merchant mdl 177 ""Inashichi"" to the field.</li>  	<li>Using Inashichi's effect, add Karakuri Bonze mdl 9763 ""Kunamzan"" to the hand.</li>  	<li>Special summon Kunamzan to the field using his own effect.</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 ""Burei"" to the field using Kunamzan and Inashichi.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Karakuri Gama mdl 4624 ""Shirokunishi"" to the field using Burei's effect.</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X ""Bureido"" to the field using Shirokunishi and Burei.</li>  	<li>Special Summon another Shirokunishi to the field using Bureido's effect.</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Super Shogun mdl 00N ""Bureibu"" to the field using Shirokunishi and Bureido.</li> </ol> There are a lot of possible combos that this deck can start with that allows you to get Bureibu to the field immediately and the summoning/swarming engine can be faster with the right card replacements. You could even add more defensive cards like Hand Traps if you wanted to due to this Deck's many replaceable cards."

I was initially interested in the Painters because I remembered seeing them somewhere on a certain Yugituber's channel, but I didn't remember really in what context, and I was looking for a deck to play anyways, so I looked up some stuff and it took me a surprising amount of time to make a deck that I could feel comfortable was close to being an optimal construction of the pure version of this deck.  <span><strong><em><span>WHY WEATHER PAINTERS?</span></em></strong></span>  This is an archetype that revolves around the idea, of slowly building up a ton of advantage, being incredibly resilient while it's at it and also very brain intensive (seriously this might be one of the most mentally taxing decks I've ever played, but don't let that deter you!), it's not incredibly uncommon to see boards with every single monster and spell/trap space filled, with your opponent on their last legs with less than 20 cards left in their deck, a barebones board and a stacked grave/banish zone.  So if you like working your brain, looking for the most optimal play at every step of every phase, building massive boards with a ton of moving parts, and shrugging off handtraps and removal (given that you don't die on the second turn) this deck might just be for you. <span><em><strong>So what does this deck do, anyways?</strong></em></span>  Glad you asked. <span><strong>First</strong></span>, the archetype's main gameplay mechanics are: -Special summoning themselves from the banish zone when they banish themselves for cost during the standby phase of the next turn (not a once per turn so you can special summon multiple copies of the same Painter) -Spells and Traps which grant effects to the Painters in their column or in their adjacent columns, that let them banish for cost (all of these are quick effects at the time of writing and only two are... pseudo hard once per turns, you'll see what I mean later) And <span><strong><span>second</span></strong></span>: controls the first two or three turns of the game to get itself set up. You accomplish this with generic floodgate cards and interruptions, because this deck has the space and the ability to play them without hampering itself in the process, these interactions will be explained in further detail later on.  <span><em><strong><span>A rundown of archetype monsters to run in this deck</span></strong></em></span>  As for the specific effects of the in-archetype cards, the list is as follows:  <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow</a>: Main searcher, upon normal summoning her, she <strong>place</strong>s an archetype spell/trap on the field so she dodges most handtraps by herself, as you are not adding the card to your hand before activating it. However, if you activate a <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a> before normal summoning her, you will be able to immediately banish her for cost after you trigger her <strong>place</strong> on field effect, making her untargetable with cards like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler and </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> , effectively rendering her immune to every handtrap except maybe Gamma, and even then you will still get to search your entire archetype with <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas.<em> Here I will mention that Every Painter comes back when they banish themselves for cost during the standby phase of the next turn, even if they get negated, and paying their cost is immediate, your opponent may not activate anything AFTER you declare the effect but BEFORE you banish, so even if they have a Lancea for example, activating it in response to your Painters' effects makes no difference, this is what makes them so strong at protecting themselves. </em></a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Thunder"">The Weather Painter Thunder: Recycler, turns any continuous card you can/would like to get rid off into any archetype spell/trap card which is overall very helpful because you can turn off plenty of floodgates at will, and quickly adapt to whatever situation you're facing. </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>: One of the most flexible cards in the archetype, and the third most important card imo, it's effect allows you to recycle up to two of your archetype spells/traps by placing them back on the field, if another face-up The Weather <strong>CARD </strong>is sent to the grave, so this is one of the ways with which to protect your backrow. However, remember how I said this is one of the most flexible cards in the archetype? Well, not only does it only require any archetype monster or spell/trap for it's effect, it can also be used in tandem with Thunder's effect for a combo that can net you a plus 2 in card advantage, and three archetype spells/traps, this combo can also be used to reposition the archetype spells/traps to facilitate your plays or just fix an error in your placement. Beautiful card, 8/10 because I don't like cloud days.  <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora: This card is a key player in keeping your backrow intact, as well as being a decently sized body and has a nifty combo with Cloud which I'll talk about in a moment, even if it rarely ever comes up. It's effect stops your opponent from targeting or destroying any face-up archetype spell/trap you control, and seeing how this card is easily summoned with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Rainbowed Canvas"">The Weather Rainbowed Canvas</a>, a card we'll get to later, it's a blanket protection effect from most removal effects in the game, unless they're using a card like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig The Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig The Ominous Omen, that allows them to banish without targeting, any card on the field or a card like </a><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. Aside from the blanket protection effect, this monster also has a nifty effect on normal summon, where it can <strong>place</strong> any archetype spell/trap on the field, from deck hand or grave; and as you may have noticed, she is indeed a level 6, requiring one tribute to normal summon, which in turn activates <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>'s effect, to search a card, and potentially plus 2 on her summon.  <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Sun"">The Weather Painter Sun: This is the last archetype main deck monster we'll be playing, mainly because their last monster The Weather Painter Rain, is way less useful on her own and her effect doesn't make her worth running another brick for, so unfortunately this is what we have to work with in the main deck. Fortunately this is a good note to end on, because this ol fella comes in very clutch and serves as a crucial pieces to complete your board of Painters, his effect allows him to revive himself from the grave at the cost of sending one of your continuous spell/trap cards to the grave, <em>AND IF YOU DO</em>, placing one archetype spell/trap card on your field, this limits his use to only being a late game support, when you have an archetype spell/trap in your hand at all times, and since he can come back from the grave, you can feel free putting him in spots where other Painters would be very vulnerable, because him getting destroyed doesn't translate into any meaningful loss for you, so you can save your battle protection for other painters, and again, his effect works in tandem with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud to plus off of his summon. Can be a bit bricky, but he offers too much in the way of supporting the archetype later on in the duel, that he makes up for it that way.</a>  <span><em><strong><span>Archetype spell/trap cards</span></strong></em></span>  Hello again! Now that we're done talking about the main deck monsters and how cool they are (I always imagined them banishing themselves and coming back, as going to the sky to paint then coming back down to chill out with the rest of their crew) we may now talk about the bread and butter, the meat and potatoes, the pellucid core of this archetype, which refracts disperses the sky light to create 7 different differently colored canvases for our Painters to use.  Or if you want to be less obtuse, we'll be talking about The Weather spell/trap cards, which all share the effect of granting an effect to every Painter in their same column, or any adjacent column, these effects all banish for cost, and they are all quick effects; and this is where things get interesting, because now it's not just about choosing the effects you want, but also which monsters will get which effects. I should note that we are excluding <a data-name=""The Weather Sunny Canvas"">The Weather Sunny Canvas</a> and <a data-name=""The Weather Cloudy Canvas"">The Weather Cloudy Canvas as they are only to play in casual builds, given that by themselves, they are pretty annoying bricks to draw into, with Sunny being a support card that's only useful later on, and Cloudy has an effect which can be used to protect your painters by being able to trigger at virtually any time, so you get a free banish for potentially 3 of your painters, it can also save you from some OTK situations, but it's not really any better than other cards you'd rather play, that don't hurt your consistency.</a>  <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>: coincidentally, the best monster in the archetype has the best spell card in the archetype, as this card allows you to turn any Painter on the field into a searcher, and this can be used in a myriad of ways, however the ones you'll be using the most are, searching for turn one plays, or searching to dodge targeting effects. However, remember what I said about some of these cards being pseudo hard once per turns? Well, this card lets you activate it as many times as you want, with the restriction that you can't add cards to your hand from your deck for the rest of this turn except by drawing them ONLY IF you actually added a card to your hand, so what you can do is, banish multiple monsters to activate this effect, and not only will this be basically unstoppable, as the effect is technically a monster effect so you won't be disrupted by any targeting spell/trap removal, nor can they use targeting monster negation, nor can they stop this effect by only negating it once, they have to do it a maximum of three times to negate your one search, and you get to protect all of your monsters for your trouble from any field wipes or targeting effects, so you can chain cards which this card gave effects to (or any other card for that matter) immediately before you activate some sort of field wipe like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> or floodgate like <a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn, because you can basically fulfill their requirement whenever you want. (No Torrential does not miss timing on this, it's pretty awesome I know) </a>  <a data-name=""The Weather Rainbowed Canvas"">The Weather Rainbowed Canvas: (REMEMBER THAT THIS CARD REQURIES THE OPPONENT TO HAVE A MONSTER SO YOUR MONSTERS CAN ACTIVATE IT!!!!) This card is kind of a spoiler for what is to come, as you can see an extra Painter there I didn't talk about yet in this card's artwork, but we'll get there when we'll get there, anyways, this is one of the best cards in this archetype, giving the ability to your Painters to tag out into any other Painter from your deck on a quick effect, that shares the same weird restriction as </a><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas, where you get to activate the effect granted by this card as many times as you want, however, you can only special summon from deck, using it, once per turn, this can be used with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora</a> or <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud for a quick effect protection for your other spell/trap cards, or at the end of a turn to sneak in an extra monster to summon during the next standby phase, another nifty combo you can do with this card and </a><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>, is tag in a monster, then immediately search another monster during your opponent's end phase, which will get you a plus two during your turn. <a data-name=""The Weather Thundery Canvas"">The Weather Thundery Canvas</a>: This card grants your monsters the ability to return any monster they battle with to the hand at the start of the damage step, which is really good because it's non destroying, non targeting battle protection and monster removal, it also happens at the start of the damage step, so unless they want to negate the effect, they can't try to do anything weird when you activate this effect in order to try and dodge it. So effectively this is one way the deck leverages it's advantage to dismantle boards and get in for damage with the mediocre stats it has to offer (aside from Snow's defensive stat)  <a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas: For spell/trap removal, we have this card, it's effect allows your Painters to banish themselves with the goal of returning a spell/trap card your opponent controls to their hand, and this is quite useful for dealing with traps during your opponent's end phase, because any card you're banishing for cost at that point in time will come back during your next turn, also continuous spells and field spells fold to this card, because those cards' effects do not go off if they leave the field (with a couple of exceptions) so that's one way to lock them out of field/continuous spells that can only be activated once per turn, or whose effects can only be used once per turn. One way you can turn this card into an absolutely obnoxious spell/trap disabler, is using </a><a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance and returning all of their spells and traps to the hand during the end phase, your spells and traps can just be placed instead of set and activated from the hand in a lot of cases, and admittedly it does shutdown a great amount of decks. However, I don't recommend using this trick as it leaves you with nothing if they have a chainable spell/trap removal spell, which they can use during the draw phase to stop your activation, and you want to activate </a><a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> as soon as possible to get the most out of it, so you lose the element of surprise offered by other floodgates, and you have to pass on using one of your other archetype spells/traps in order to pull this lock off, and even then it's very fragile against a deck that can function properly without it's spells or traps, so if you do end up running <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance, keep it</a> as a side option, as it does shut down a lot of meta decks very effectively.  <a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a>: And here we are at our last archetype trap, this card lets your monsters banish themselves if a card is added from the deck to the hand (be careful of activating this on yourself if you're playing online) and in turn lets you banish the added card from the player's hand, and make them draw a card, this is a negative 1 in card advantage, however it's very effective against any specific combo decks which heavily rely on getting to certain combo pieces for their plays, it also banishes, so unless you're playing against Thunder Dragons, that card is effectively gone, never to see their hand again. Note that this effect isn't once per turn and can be activated multiple times, even on the card you made them draw, which is pretty fun but ultimately kind of useless.  Note that all of these effects stack, which means that based on your positioning, any given Weather Painter could have up to 3(4 but we'll get to that) effects on the board, when have you seen a monster with 3 awesome quick effects!  <em><span><span><b></b><span><b>Explaining</b></span><span><b> the rest of the deck</b></span></span></span></em>  In this section I will talk about my non archetype inclusions in this deck specifically, and mention some options you could opt to run instead It's pretty simple what you want to accomplish with the rest of this deck really, you just want to survive your opponent's turn, and maybe keep a floodgate or two to smooth out the process of filling up your field and emptying your opponent's. I must also mention that we don't care if these become dead cards later on, as we can just search out whatever cards we need from the archetype.  two exceptions are the <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality and </a><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, which are just consistency boosters on your first turn, because you don't special summon anything on it meaning you can make use of them both and lose virtually nothing in the process. (Of note is the fact that I swapped Prosperity+Duality combo for Extravagance, and adjusted the Extra deck to reflect that. Not everyone agrees on whether Prosperity or Extravagance is better in this deck, and I happen to be one of the people who prefer the latter, as I think more resources are more important to this strategy than just getting to your engine, ALSO I DID THE MATH ON THIS, AND WITH THE RATIOS IN THIS LIST, PROSPERITY MAKES A SMALL DIFFERENCE IN GETTING TO SNOW BUT NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY RUNNING IT OVER THE EXTRA CARD FOR ME) As for the floodgates we are running in the main and side deck, we have: <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain, which only affects your monsters' on field effects so you can still use the effects granted by your archetype spells/traps. </a><a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure, because you pretty much never care to see your monsters go to grave (early on) and it shuts down a lot of decks if they don't have a way to deal with it, buying you time to get set up. </a><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos, for the same reason as our previous inclusion. (OLD TECH CHOICE BUT YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE IT) </a><a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">, this is what we use to dodge their S/T removal when we know we're going first</a>. <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter, is a card you always want to draw in your opening hand, disables most decks for one turn, and can save you when you're going second. Necrovalley is a very good card against a ton of relevant decks and does basically nothing to you (early on, as we can make use of the graveyard later on in the game), so of course we'll jump on the opportunity to completely kill all of the meta, at least for one turn. And finally </a><a data-name=""Droll And Lock Bird"">Droll And Lock Bird, this card is for really obnoxious draw a million cards decks, such as a decks running the Danger! engine, Drytron, Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika, to an extent, @Ignister, a whole bunch of rogue decks etc... because the name of the game here, is to not die, but also out advantage our opponent, meaning we're not in love with the idea of getting super out advantaged on the first/second turn. Other generic cards include: </a><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute we can dodge this card pretty easily, and it nullifies a lot of the damage we'd otherwise be taking. </a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, pay your lifepoints, this card is always online, it protects your backrow when you're still vulnerable, and counters a lot of cards that screw this deck over like <a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall, or </a><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched, also disrupts combos, just be careful about using it when it only facilitates you getting OTKd. </a><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, (you can take this card out if you want, as it is incredibly pricy) this card is a godsend, it's such a useful card in today's metagame where there are so many decks which use only one type of monster, and it's non targeting non destroying removal!!!! WHAT?! (OLD) <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown, useful for interrupting stuff and serves as decent battle protection, just take their biggest monster and use it to block. </a><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, this card is good in pretty much every deck, moving on. <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters, the reason I went with this instead of cosmic cyclone, is because it's the best way to out backrow, that doesn't make you banish something, which is valuable if you get </a><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>d or <a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall</a>ed. <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, self explanatory. (OLD) <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched, clean up their board, and chill. </a><a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> Kaijus have good synergy with the Painters, as they can just bounce them back for future use, even during the same turn, which is pretty nice.  We also now run <a data-name=""LOSE 1 TURN"">LOSE 1 TURN</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>, we have the extra deck space to spare, so Punishment is really nice as an interruption, because popping cards on your opponent's is really overpowered in Yu Gi Oh. And L1T is incredibly good as a way to protect yourself from any OTKs and on summon effects.  Other options you can opt into: I don't recommend most of these for every purpose but they can serve to add something the deck needs, or just make it more fun and casual. I would like to start off by mentioning one of my favorite ideas while building this deck, running a million Kaijus and bouncing them back for invalidating boss monsters, and when you don't get too great a hand, you can always just have a Kaiju battle, this also gives you an excuse to run <a data-name=""Interrupted kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted kaiju Slumber</a>, which is always fun. <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>, if you really don't like monster effects. <a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>, if you're confident it won't be negated or destroyed, since you can always make it online and protect your monsters, while completely wrecking your opponent's board. <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>, you can get this card off the field with Thunder so there isn't too much to worry about, but good spell/trap removal deals with it just fine, and it doesn't stop your opponent from doing things completely it just kind of slows them down, many decks don't even care about getting hit by this card, so I don't run it. <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance, is an okay card and can absolutely win you games, however it brings with it many problems, as it doesn't disrupt anything, and doesn't stop monster effects, and is easily disposed of by </a><a data-name=""cosmic cyclone"">cosmic cyclone</a>/<a data-name=""twin twisters"">twin twisters, if they have those in their hand the turn you activate this card, still it can be quite obnoxious with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas. </a><a data-name=""Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen"">Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen, this card enables some combos with this deck, because </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Thunder"">The Weather Painter Thunder</a> can indeed get rid of it and replace it with <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>, to search <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow, whom you can normal summon to get two monsters and two archetype spells/traps, however this card isn't all that consistent, and it can sometimes brick your hands, when you could've gotten something to further your goal of staying alive for the first few turns, also it completely disables the use of </a><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality, because you're only looking to use that on turn one, and you're also looking to use this on turn 1, but do consider running it in more casual builds! </a><a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat, I have not tested this card however it has the potential to be a great stalling card as well as giving you link fodder.</a>  <em><strong><span>The Extra deck! </span></strong></em>This is where it gets good! We'll start off by talking about our last archetype card (and my personal favorite):  <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow: This is the boss monster of the Archetype, requiring 3 archetype monsters for it's link summon, can NOT use all the same effects other Painters can use, with an average 2400atk points for a link 3. This card comes with two effects it can send itself to the graveyard when your opponent would special summon a monster to negate the summon and destroy the monster, however be mindful this can only be used if she was link summoned. Her second effect and the one most impressive, is that every archetype monster she points to can banish themselves to negate any card's/effect's activation. This is it, this is the late game threat your opponent's have to deal with, if they're somehow still clawing back to give you things to remove every turn, this is what will extinguish their resources, by this point you will have a lot of material to work with to feed her omni negate effect, and not many decks can get over three omni negates when they're gasping for resources.</a>  <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder </a><a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician and </a><a data-name=""Number 47: Nightmare Shark"">Number 47: Nightmare Shark: 47 attacks directly, Downerd overlays on top of it, Zeus cleans it all up, and gives you an impressive 3000 atk beatstick with a quick effect field nuke, you want this to be your last play, when you've run your opponent out of stuff they can use, such as when they have an empty hand, and kill them on the next turn, you can make your Painters dodge the effect, but not the same could be said for your backrow, even tho it is recoverable, you probably won't need to do that. The Weather Painters are mostly level 3s, so this works out. </a>  <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword: Good removal when you need it for an imperial Iron wall, or some other pesky thing you can't get rid of otherwise. </a>  <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: can buy you some time if you're trying to recover, easy to make.</a>  <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax </a><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon: big beatsticks. </a>  <a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon </a><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: come in handy every once in a while.  <a data-name=""Lyna The Light Charmer, Shining"">Lyna The Light Charmer, Shining</a>: not yet out in the TCG, however there isn't much time left for it to do so, and when it does, be sure to run it as it is quite easy to make and can steal a good amount of monsters.  <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn: removal in case you need it, it's not too taxing to link into things because you have </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Sun"">The Weather Painter Sun, whom you can recur back to your field quite easily.</a>  <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: use her before linking into your big beatsticks to make them immune to destruction.  <span><em><strong>Cards this deck loses to</strong></em></span>  Watch out for the following cards, and make sure you know how to deal with them, or at least know when to surrender.  <a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall: blocks you from using your main gameplay mechanic, same as </a><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea.</a>  Evenly Matched: your well set up field is a prime target for this card. However, it's somewhat less obnoxious to deal with due to the fact that you can just make your Painters dodge it, it's not great going second against you because your field is very unimpressive at that point, but it still has the potential to do tremendous damage, this is why we have <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, nevertheless it banishes facedown, which stops the recursion effects you get from <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a> and <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora.</a>  <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm/</a><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Getting hit by these... isn't the worst thing in the world, given that you can recover from them with <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>, and search <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow on their activation, provided you have the proper canvas, so you can set up for your plays next turn. However, now the chance of you dying goes way up, your only saving grace if they draw into these cards, is if you activated a </a><a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">, or had a </a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow""> ready.</a>  <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One: this card doesn't really end the game for you, as you can just cycle through your painters on each standby phase, by activating their effect, summoning the next painter, activating that one's effect, and so on. It's still quite a hinderance, this is why we run </a><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters.</a>  <em><strong><span>THE SIDE DECK</span></strong></em>  This is a newly added section, specifically written for the latest update to my decklist as of writing. I will be underlining the thought process behind building this side deck, and what it means for anyone trying to play it.  What are we trying to side? And how are we trying to side? The current format (as of writing this) is very heavy on handtraps, you gotta have em, the more you can run the better your deck will fare, if you can't run that many, you'd better have a huge pay off (Infernoble, Drytron) or you'll be mercilessly interrupted and then destroyed by better decks running more handtraps, now as you can see we're not running too many Handtraps in the main deck, and before I keep going I have to say that a more handtrap heavy build of this deck (in the maindeck specifically) is absolutely worth experimenting with, that may prove to be the better way to play it, however I think the floodgates and trap line up + the handtraps we already run in the main are basically the best you can get for a first game against an unknown deck. Moreover, I think the list has a bunch of options to facilitate going second if you get unlucky on the die roll, <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring are obvious ones, but less obvious are </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring""> and </a><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">, which can ward off a couple potential otks, and you really just want to not die + preserve your resources, as long as you can do that, you have a chance. Now that I've spoken in length about the main deck (Again) I have to tell you that the reason we are running mostly handtraps in the side deck, is so we can go into them during the later games, you can decide what is good after game 1, then fill up your maindeck with some of those options, you can also try to side into more handtraps to avoid spell and trap destruction ruining your entire gameplan during game 2/3, because why hope to draw into Judgment, if you don't even need it! Not much to say here other than </a><a data-name=""Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">, which is a very a popular handtrap in this format, and works against a lot of the best decks this format (Drytron, Prank kids are two examples) and is just a very nice handtrap to have, it also negates activations so it can be used during the damage!</a>  &nbsp;  And that about wraps it up for your introduction to this deck, I hope you learned something, and if you got to this part, you have my deepest gratitude for not making the 4 hours making this go to waste haha!  <span><strong>Sidenote</strong></span>: I will be making adjustments to this list as I see fit, in order to make it even more optimal, recent changes include adding <a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a>, in place of <a data-name=""Droll And Lock Bird"">Droll And Lock Bird, and putting in an extra </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>, removing one <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">. Some of these changes come courtesy of the Weather Painter discord I have cut the </a><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turns because it disables our removal option with Thundery, and that's quite irritating, and after a bit of testing, this ended up being more than a minor hinderance, it's also quite high commitment to activate.</a>  Added three <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity and cut </a><a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">, and another copy of </a><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality.</a>  Instead of Lose 1 Turn we will be experimenting with <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole as we have enough main deck options to counter on field effects.</a>  Added in two <a data-name=""Solemn strikes"">Solemn strikes</a> as they do what <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole and more, the cost of lifepoints is fine because we'll get to survive to play our game and potentially win Removed Strike added back </a><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a><a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole""> and </a><a data-name=""NecroValley"">NecroValley, alongside a new card, </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>  The new handtraps added are <a data-name=""Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion</a>, and <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma ADDED </a><a data-name=""PIRI REIS MAP"">PIRI REIS MAP</a><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">, SWAP THIS OUT FOR REAL LIFE VERSIONS OF THIS DECK.</a>"

OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/GxAmKfGIo6E &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck aplica un burn virtualmente infinito, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets y ladrillos.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck es muy denso y no tiene acceso a protección.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

You can get it<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en""> from any hand, you just need to summon Isolde. The deck is also capable of an FTK on second turn thanks to cards like lightning storm and dark hole.<span lang=""en""> If you draw a piece you can perform the combo summoning the 3rd Selene (ad use her to summon the piece from your hand) after you have given True Exodia to your opponent (you need to summon one extra monster with teasure panda after that, otherwise you can't summon unicorn at the end).</span> The main problem is that if you go second without your destructions your strategy is completely destroyed although you can still play. You must keep going with the combo (use True Exodia instead of Ventdra to make the second Selene) and use one of the pieces and ""Flamvell Guard"" or ""Water Spirit"" to summon ""Crystron Halqifibrax"" and with it's effect summon ""Red Rose Dragon"" and you get it. You can end with a nice board with ""Apollousa, Bow of the</span><span lang=""en""> Goddes"" (with four materials), </span><span lang=""en"">""Borreload Savage Dragon"" (with 3 counters on it) and ""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"".

Deus X-Krawler & Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon!,"This deck was built around Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx, which is coming out in the TCG June 4th 2021 in Lightning Overdrive.  Fittingly, I'm using 3 Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx, and one Arsenal Summoner to search it to the hand from the deck.  Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx floats into the original Guardian Sphinx so I'm running one of those.  These cards are flip monsters, so I want to be able to set them face-down, which basically limits me to normal summoning.  To enable me to normal set high-level monsters, I'm using Mausoleum of the Emperor.  Since I can use Red-Eyes Fusion during the same turn that I set a monster, I'm running a maximum Red-Eyes engine for Dragoon. Since I want to be able to search Mausoleum of the Emperor, I'm also using set rotation.  To use set rotation, I added the field spell Trickstar Lightstage, which searches Candina, which searches Corobane for a free special summon that allows you to make Verte Anaconda.  In addition, light stage can pop traps or easily force your opponent to activate Mausoleum of the Emperor which you can use even from their side of the field.  Another great card to normal set with Mausoleum of the Emperor is Deus X-Krawler.  An opening field of Deus X and Dragoon is surprisingly hard to break.  Since Deus X Krawler floats into a level 9, I added Jurrac Titano.  I only run two hand traps, Nibiru which is searchable by Gallant Granite, and Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood to get more LP for summoning.

Optimally, your best hand going first will be<strong> ZS - Ascend Sage</strong>, <strong>ZS - Arms Sage</strong>, and access to a Rank 4 through <strong>Onomatoparia</strong> or by hard drawing like <strong>Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong> and either <strong>Zubababancho</strong> or <strong>Dodododwarf</strong>. Your end board is 2 monster negates, a spell negate, and I guess battle ensurance.  Then you get an additional monster negate on your opponent's turn. </span>  <span><strong>Arms Sage</strong> and <strong>Ascend Sage</strong> are hear specifically to search <strong>Hope Force</strong> and <strong>ZW - Lighting Blade</strong>. 3 <strong>Utopia Onomatopoeia</strong> since it is access to a Rank 4 when hard drawing it and another <strong>Onomat</strong> name or through <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>. 3 <strong>Zubababancho Gagagacoat</strong> summons itself from hand and the 1 <strong>Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</strong> summons itself from grave. 1 <strong>ZW - Lightning Blade</strong> for destruction protection and 1 <strong>ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> which is 1 of your negates and its sadly a garnet. And 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. </span>  <span>For Spells/Traps we play 1 <strong>ROTA</strong>, 1 <strong>ZEXAL Entrust</strong> which can really just be <strong>Reborn</strong> at this point, 1 <strong>Rank-Up-Magic ZEXAL Force</strong> which is just here if you want to summon <strong>Utopia Ray V </strong>for removal, and 1 <strong>Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force</strong> which summons <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> and is an essential part in getting your negates through its attach from grave effect. 3 <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong>, 3 <strong>Generation Force</strong>, 3 <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>, 3 <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>, 1 <strong>Double or Nothing</strong>, and 1 <strong>Called By</strong>. We are lastly playing 3 <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong> (which isnt in the database of this site yet) which prevents your opponent from negating your <strong>RUM</strong>s and it stacks the 1-of <strong>Shining Draw</strong> that you are running so that you can use its effect for fun I guess.</span>  <span>Extra Deck. 1<strong> Zeus</strong> since Xyz deck. 1 <strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragnar</strong> which is arguably <strong>Utopia Kaiser</strong> but better. 1 <strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon</strong> since you can make it and it is a dragon for <strong>Draglubion</strong>. 1 <strong>Number 97: Draglubion</strong> which cannot be targeted and it gets you to more negates. 1 <strong>Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</strong> which is a negate. 1 <strong>Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon</strong> which gets you <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s destruction effect following its negation when you use <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong>. 1 <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> which is another negate. 1 <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong> for OTKs going second. 1 <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> which is another negate. 1 <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray V</strong> since I like its destruction and burn effect. 1 <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong> which ensures your <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> has at least 4 materials. 1 <strong>Utopia Double</strong> and 3 vanilla <strong>Utopia</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck: Nothing Special. <strong>Nibiru</strong>, <strong>Cosmic</strong>, <strong>Droplet</strong>, <strong>Imperm</strong>. <strong>Xyz Import</strong> and <strong>Xyz Encore</strong> are cool since they can be searched. <strong>ZW - Tornado Bringer</strong> is here to side in against decks like <strong>Eldlich</strong> whose effect activates in hand. You can't negate it since your negates work ""on field"" only so <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> prevents targeting.</span>  <span>Here's the Combo if you open the perfect hand of both<strong> ZS</strong> and <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>. <span><strong>(1)</strong> </span>Special <strong>ZS - Ascend Sage</strong> and then <strong>Special ZS - Arms Sage</strong>. <strong><span>(2) </span></strong>Xyz into <strong>Utopia Double</strong> and activate the effect to add a <strong>Zexal Weapon</strong> second to chain block against <strong>Ash</strong>. <span><strong>(3)</strong> </span>Search <strong>Hope Force</strong> and <strong>Lighting Blade</strong>. <span><strong>(4)</strong> </span>Use <strong>Onomatoparia</strong> and discard for cost: add any 2 <strong>Onomat</strong> names.<strong> <span>(5) </span></strong>Get both names onto the field and Xyz into normal <strong>Utopia</strong>. <span><strong>(6)</strong> </span>Rank-up into <strong>Utopia Ray</strong> and then activate <strong>Hope Force</strong> to Summon <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong>. <strong><span>(7) </span>Utopia Dragnar</strong> detach 2 to summon <strong>Draglubion</strong>. <strong><span>(8) </span>Hope Force</strong> attaches to <strong>Draglubion</strong> from grave. <strong><span>(9) </span>Draglubion</strong> detach summon <strong>Hope Harbinger</strong> and attach either <strong>Utopic Dragon</strong> or <strong>Numeron Dragon</strong>. <strong><span>(10) </span>Utopia Double</strong> detach add <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> and rank-up into <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong>. <strong><span>(11) </span></strong>Equip <strong>Lighting Blade</strong> to it and detach to equip <strong>Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>. <strong><span>(12) </span></strong>Next turn, activate <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> again to summon <strong>Photon Lord</strong> and equip <strong>Hope Force</strong> from grave.  Thats the usual combo but you can do more based on what you draw. If you have <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> then great. If you have <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong> activated, then attach <strong>Prime Photon Dragon</strong> from your Extra Deck to add destruction to <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s negation. If you drew more <strong>Onomat</strong> names off of <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>, then you can even make <strong>Utopia Ray V</strong> if you also drew <strong>ZEXAL Force</strong>.</span>  <span>Going second, just make <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong>, summon <strong>Draglubion</strong>, summon <strong>Numeron Dragon</strong> and attack for big boy damage.</span>  <span>This deck hard loses to effects that activate in hand since all of your negations are only for on field effects. You can play according to this by summoning <strong>Photon Lord</strong> off of <strong>Dragnar</strong> first to play around things like <strong>Nibiru</strong>,<strong> Gamma</strong>, and <strong>D.D. Crow</strong> (<strong>Ash</strong> isnt that big of a problem), but you need<strong> ZEXAL Field</strong> activated in order to attach <strong>Prime Photon Dragon</strong> for the destruction part of <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s effect to occur. You can even play <strong>Terraforming</strong> instead of something like the <strong>Shining Draw</strong> if you really want to play around handtraps, but you also need to remember that this is not a ""<strong>Photon</strong>"" or ""<strong>Galaxy</strong>"" deck so you can only negate and have the destruction effect once.</span>"

Summon Demise and nuke the opponents board ,"Hey everyone, tried my hands at a Demise Ritual Deck, as I played him way back when he came out. It is inspired by other Demise decks on YGO Prodeck, but I tweaked it to my own liking.  The deck itself is pretty self explanatory, try to get Demise out, best with Sauravis in the hand for protection and then nuke the board. His battle protection and Sauravis should let him survive the enemy turn and then you wipe the board again and finish up the game. Impcantations and Manju included for consistency, Danger! Thunderbird for the XYZ Plays if you can only get the standard Demise out, but you can of course play better engines. Its pretty fun to wipe the board, but the protection of Demise is not too great so watch out for those Handtraps and Negates.  Hope you enjoy the deck and let me know if you have any improvements/ideas."

Main point is over the combo is to get <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> in the GY to special summon it off of Shaman of the Tenyi's effect to go into a one card Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara, So one of two boards you can go full combo is 1) <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a>, and <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> or 2) <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, and <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>. Most of the time your board may just have <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a>, and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a>.  You also want to try and have all different attribute Tenyi Spirits in the GY because there graveyard banish effect is a hard once per turn. The ones to make sure you have over the combo are <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a>, and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Mapura"">Tenyi Spirit - Mapura</a>.  The two main weak point of the deck is when <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> activating its effect, it's a hard choke point to recover from if it's negated but if you have <a data-name=""Monk&lt;a data-name=&quot;Shaman of the Tenyi&quot;&gt; of the Tenyi&lt;/a&gt;"">Monk</a><a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi""> of the Tenyi</a> on the field you can pivot into a <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> and protect it with the level 4 Tenyi Spirits you have in the GY, also this deck has real protect against spells/traps, non targeting effects, and send/return effects."

Constellar is a little hand reliant and doesn’t have a lot of recovery but I tried to make it work. This build tries to abuse the fact that some Constellars are beasts and beast-warriors by taking a tri-brigade spin on it. The new card from BLVO is also really helpful to have. Because all of the Constellars are light monsters I added galaxy soldier and nova/infinity to the mix as well. Nova’s summoning effect even gets use sometimes to summon Zuben(full names too long). I’m playing three star chart for resource gathering which helps a lot in the grind game. The bujins the extra deck help get more extension, the xyz monster takes franktell and kaus but it mills five which is really helpful at times.  If there’s any questions you have feel free to ask!"

Das funktioniert mit Cyber Dragon Core + Cyberdark Claw. Diese zwei auf der Starthand ergeben den End Drache. Aber auch nur dann, wenn man keine Handtraps abbekommt. Hier kommen wir auch schon zur größten Schwäche des Decks.</span> <span>Handtraps, die den Combos-Aufbau des Decks stören. Sobald man eine Handtrap kassiert, ist meist Schluss mit dem Zug und der End Drache kommt nicht auf das Feld.</span> <span>Es fehlt dem Deck halt auch mit seiner enormen Seachpower immer noch an Konstanz. Eventuell kommt im laufe der Zeit ja noch Ersatz für Horn, Edge, Keel.</span> <span>Oder sogar ein neues Fusionsmonster. (Gedankenspiele wie ""3xCyberdark Monster"" oder ""1xCyberdark Maschine + 1xCyberdark Drache Monster"") Es könnte ja nur den Simplen Effekt haben, den Cyber End Drache aus dem Extra-Deck an sich auszurüsten. Das würde die Beschwörung des Dark End beschleunigen und wäre auch nicht broken, da Dark End es ebenfalls nicht ist. Naja träumen kann man ja noch....</span>  <span>Searchpower: Cyberdark  Chimera, Cyberdark Cannon, Cyberdark Claw, Cyberdark World, Cybernetic Horizon, Cyber Dragon Core, Cyber Emergency</span>  <span>Useless: Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, Cyberdark Keel</span>  <span>-Dragon Buster für Lockdown</span>  <span>-Crossout Designator &amp; Called um den Combo Ablauf zu sichern</span>  <span><span>-Ash Blossom  &amp; Impermanence um den Gegner zu stören und auch als Ziel für Crossout Designator </span><span>(Droll &amp; Lock Bird im Side, da dieser auch dem Deck extrem schadet)</span></span>  <span>-Attachment Cybern + Cyberdark Invasion sind eine schöne Combi um immer wieder Cyberdarkness auf das Feld zu schmeißen und 2-3 Negates zu haben</span>  <span>-Gear Gigant X ist für einen Search und Zeus</span>  <span>-Cyber Dragon Nova gegen Dogmatika Maximus (Mechaba war auch eine Idee, nur der Platz fehlt)</span>  <span>- Feather Duster, Twin Twister, und Lightning Storm sind für die bösen -nicht aktiven Effekte- da. (Mystic Mine, Skill Drain oder auch Macro Cosmos (wobei man die ersten beiden mit Cyberdark Invasion schießen kann, bei Macro Cosmos klappt das nicht da man die ausgerüstete Karte in den Friedhof befördern muss))</span>  <span><strong>Fazit:</strong></span>  <span>Ich habe mir schon immer guten Support für Cyberdark gewünscht und hatte viel Hoffnung für das Structure Deck. Letzten Endes wurde daraus ein mehr oder weniger Spielbares Fun-Deck. Immerhin. Ein bisschen mehr liebe so wie bei dem &gt;Utopia Structure Deck&lt; würde dem Cyberdark Thema noch sehr gut tun. Mal schauen was die Zukunft uns noch bringt.</span>  &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;"

Main Deck  2 Alertitt. Most important recycler in the deck. With Shaddoll Ariel, Huaquero, and Invocation running around you don't want too get your Alertitt banished.  Queen. Personal preference either run 1 queen or 1 king or some list drop both entirely. I think Queen is the stronger of the two with her non targeting sending any card.  2 Nauya. You can drop the queen and run 3 Nauya if you so please. Personally I rather not open with a Nauya in hand she can somewhat start plays in certain hands, but rather see Nunu in hand.  Zoha. Idk why he dosent show on this list but this is 40 cards just dosent show zoha.  2 Water Lilly. You don't want to see this card in your opening hand. Always search for it with nauya secondary effect and always go for the full effect to special summon a reptile from graveyard.  Invocation. Again don't want to open Invocation ever. This list only runs 3 Invoked fusions so 1 is more than enough.  3 Judgments. This deck loses to dark ruler, droplets, and superpolys. ( Side Deck: 1 Imperial order and 2 Anti-spells specially for superpolys and pray they don't chain it.)  Extra Deck.  Invoked fusions. Personal preference you can run 2 Mechaba and 1 Calliga or 2 Mechaba and 1 Augueodies. I like having the options so I run 1 of each.  Sanaphond. Flex spot. People run dweller I find sanaphond easier to make and dosent interfere with the combos like dweller having to give up the rikka combo in order to go into a dweller opening play. Also has self protection and gets big really fast.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

In all of the decks I post I will use decks that have fallen under the radar even with their supreme powers. Welcome to...</span> <h1>Reviving Old Powers</h1> <h2>Deck 1 - World Chalice</h2> This deck is very smooth when you can use it right, and it is connected to very well known decks, such as Mekk Knights and Knightmares, and not-so well known decks, such as Krawlers, Crusadias, and Guardragons. I will go over strategies and maybe even a bit of lore. So lets dive in! <h3>Monsters</h3> <span>Lets start with the three most basic monsters in this deck: Beckoned, Chosen, and Crowned by the World Chalice. These are the easiest to summon and the ones with the most combos related to them. They also have the heaviest lore out of all of the monsters. You can use these monsters to Link Summon Imduk the World Chalice Dragon and make it where you can basically summon twice in one turn. Then you can use that to get Lib the World Key Blademaster. Having a 2000 ATK point monster that can put a Spell or Trap Card on the field every turn is pretty cool, especially since we have a lot of great spells and traps in this deck. Anyway, another helpful card in this deck is World Legacy - World Chalice. This card not only combines two archetypes, it also has an incredible effect. The effect activates when it is destroyed by battle, card effect, or even just a tribute. It makes you able to summon two World Chalice monsters from your Deck, expanding the possibilities of strategies. Lee the World Chalice Fairy helps you the most when you control Imduk, as it brings a World Chalice monster from the Deck to your Hand just by being Normal Summoned. World Legacy - World Key has multiple uses, as it can help Tribute Summon and destroy any opponent Link monster, as well as connect Lib to the World Legacies.</span> <h3>Spells and Traps</h3> <span>This is where it gets interesting. Call of the Grave is a very special card that not many people know about. If used, it can block the effect of Monster Reborn! That kind of effect can seal any chance of victory away from your opponent. Call of the Haunted is well known, however, since it works like a Monster Reborn with a bit of leverage for your opponent to grab on to. World Legacy Struggle can destroy a couple of spells, but make sure you have co-linked monsters. Bottomless Trap Hole is a card less used than some other cards, even though it can destroy the dreams of many duelists in one effect. It's effect destroys and card with 1500 or more ATK as soon as it is summoned. Then there is the Field Spell known as World Legacy Discovery. This card keeps World Chalice cards from death and raises their ATK and DEF by 300. Finally, the card that can change the duel. The World Legacy is a card that, when a monster with 5 or more Levels dies, it gains a counter. With 7 counters, you can destroy the card, making you able to Special Summon any Cyberse Link monster from the Extra Deck, so make your choice!.</span> <h3>Lore</h3> <span>I saved the best for last. According to some flavor text and some improvising on my behalf, the Mekk Knights have invaded a planet inhabited by the long forgotten World Legacies. These Mekk Knights, along with Krawlers and maybe even a couple of Crusaidas, destroy towns in their wake, and are on the brink of destroying this beautiful planet. Then, after years of obscurity, the World Chalice speaks to 5 brave characters who, since it does not say, have no actual names, so I will improvise. Ningursu is a human who lives in the forest, where a type of card mentioned only in his flavor text, The Mekkstrosities, destroy every last bit of the forest, killing anyone in sight. Aurum is a young boy who has been facinated by stories of his ancestors. He wants to be a hero someday, but no one belives he can do it. When he grows up, he destroys Mekkstrocities and wears their skin. Ib, otherwise known as Lib, is a magical human in search of piece and prosperity, but she is out of luck. She protects her family and friends from Mekk Knights as they ravage her city. These three heroes, along with a baby dragon named Imduk, get a quest from a messenger from the World Chalice. This messenger, named Fairy Lee, guides them on a quest to find all of the World Legacies and bring them together to save the world. On the way, they fight hoards of Krawlers, groups of Mekk Knights, and I imagine they see some Mekkstrocities. In this quest, Ib dies in a evil magic shown in the card World Legacy Trap Globe. And at some point, Imduk either parts ways with our heros or he dies in a battle shown in World Legacy Clash. In the end, they complete their quest and the Mekk Knights either flee or they are destroyed.</span> <h3>Final Notes</h3> <span>I hope you give me suggestions for new decks to review in the comments and if you have any information to tell me about lore or anything like that, please let me know. That is all from me! Thank you, and have a good week!</span>  &nbsp;"

PK have always been a hard deck for me to get use to. Now it's definitely  one of my favorite decks because of the play style and from the anime. It's a good going first deck but it can sometimes struggle with going second against already crazy boards. That's why I added accesscode talker and knightmare unicorn to pop any cards and potentially OTK. Another card that can help OTK is Raider's Knight and Arc Rebellion. Obviously the best starter is Tour Gide and then summoning Graff into Cherubini. From there you can go into many different boards depending on the hand.

Dragoon is someway getting hit on the ban list sooner or later. This is what I plan to use if/when Dragoon gets hit. ,"Taking out the Dragoon package opens up other plays for PK Fire. Everything is still pretty standard. But here's the changes;  I've added in Isolde for extended plays. Living Fossil is in incase I draw D.D.R. Living Fossil is also an extender like Monster Reborn. But in this case it's better because of it's utility with Isolde.  I still think Artifact Scythe is heavily underrated. Preventing your opponent from using their Extra Deck for a turn can give you the game. Using Dagda is the best way of getting it out. Use Bardiche or Abomination to destroy it. Or even Twisters if you've sided them in.  After getting Scythe to the board, you can link off Dagda with I:P for Abomination or Talker.  I still like Abomination for the deck. A potential three card destruction per turn can put your opponent in check. They're going to want to destroy Abomination ASAP.  I dropped PK Wings. The most you'll see Fog Blade is two. Sending one copy of Fog Blade to the GY isn't going to hurt. I also replaced Wings with Brigandine. Easily brought to your hand with Boots for extra extension if needed.  I think everything else speaks for itself.  &nbsp;"

Firstly you special summon Ascend Sage and then activate XYZ Change Tactics and summon your other level 4. XYZ Summon into Utopia Double and search Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force. To activate Double's effect you must first have full knowledge of your hand's abilities. What do I mean? Check if you can make Number 39 with the cards in your hand in order to use him for Dagner. In this case I suggest you use Utopia Double's effect to rank him up to your Leo Utopia Ray. In case you cant make Number 39 with your current hand use Double's effect to summon him and then rank him up into Dagner. Your ideal target for Dagner's effect is number 38.  In case you want to use the new field spell (ZEXAL field) I suggest you add 2 of them plus 1 Shining Draw.

La Bone Tower absorberá el alma y Deck de tu oponente! 7w7 The zombies have started the apocalypse! The Bone ,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Enviar al Cementerio todo el Deck oponente usando el efecto de Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower. OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/3Pj2jyF2wc4 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Para iniciar, debemos invocar a Cherubini, para lo cual tendremos muchísimos extenders. Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 3 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video). <strong>Nota:</strong> La ruta de Tenyi (3 extenders) no fue incluida por ser algo trivial, ya que funciona igual que en otros videos.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Phantom knights of torn scales:</strong> Vale x4. Envía al cementerio a Cloak para traer a Boots e invocarlo gratis. Luego, destierras este último para traer a Brigandine y al mismo tiempo invocar a Scales por su efecto.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a Torn scales, Junk forward o Kagemucha knight.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene muy pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo. Con 2 extenders es suficiente, y tener más solamente lo hace mejor.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El Deck usa mill, por lo que puede ser vulnerable a Efectos Rápidos que se activan en Cementerio.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the Grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si robamos 3 garnets, será gg.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

The rest are cards which are helpful in the Archetype like Searchers, Kaijus, Floodgates and Trap Cards.  <strong>Yosenju</strong>  <strong>Kama 1:</strong> It is the best, thanks to its effect of returning to the hand opponent monsters.  <strong>Kama 2:</strong> Normally Kama 3 is required together to be useful, even so it is the one with the most ATK so a copy is not bad.  <strong>Kama 3:</strong> Look for Yosenju cards, although in a somewhat extravagant way, even so is a important monster.  <strong>Izna:</strong> The effects it has are both very useful, it can be discarded to give protection to your Yosenjus although you will usually summon it since it will be able to draw you an extra card which will be important.  <strong>Fire Formation Tenki:</strong> Look for any Yosenju.  <strong>Sword Sting:</strong> Good trap to search with Kama 3 for a next turn, even so it has requirements and other cards could be more useful.  <strong>Main-Deck</strong>  <strong>Kaijus:</strong> These have good synergy with the deck thanks to the fact that Yosenju cards specialize in returning cards to the hand, so they are a great complement.  <strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton:</strong> This is one of my favorite cards, it has very good synergy with the Deck since you can control the columns in a simple way, besides the most important things about Tiamaton is the surprise factor.  <strong>Prosperity</strong>: Being able to have a specific card is useful, also losing certain things from the Extra Deck does not matter so much to you.  <strong>Super Polymerization:</strong> Overall a brutal card.  <strong>Dogmatika Punishment: </strong>You don't care much about the Extra Deck, and the effect is pretty good.  <strong>Summon Limit: </strong>There are turns in which summoning several monsters is necessary, but among many things you can change your style of play to be able to strongly stop your opponent.  <strong>Macro Cosmos: </strong>Does GY matter?  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Starving Venom: </strong>The best Super Polymerization target.  <strong>Diplexer Chimera: </strong>Target for Cyberse of Super Polymerization.  <strong>Elder Entity N'tss:</strong> Combo with Dogmatika Punishment.  <strong>Mudragon: </strong>Easy Target for Super Polymerization.  <strong>Lightning Chidori: </strong>Good Wind Xyz.  <strong>Abyss Dweller: </strong>One of the best Xyz in the game.  <strong>Knightmares: </strong>Generic Links.  <strong>Other Options: </strong>  <strong>Pendulum Swarm</strong>: Practically all Pendulum Yosenju cards, it is a completely different style of play.  <strong>Direct Attack:</strong> You have to believe me that I lost thanks to the fact that they simply hit me directly several times, if this happens to you often, maybe a Swift Scarecrow or a Battle Fader could be more helpful, although I see them more from Side Deck.  <strong>More Traps!!!:</strong> Use traps to your liking to control the game. Crackdow and Lost Wind are good for monster control, Lost 1 Turn if you want to take advantage of the Yosenjus (Remove Tiamaton), Solemn is always good and Roar has protection from attacks.  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  I would recommend the minimum of 5 Kaijus, but many times a greater amount of these are of great help since sometimes you lose them and cannot get them back.  Remember that your maximum number of cards is 6, do not discard cards stupidly, thanks to the Fact of returning cards to your hand.  Macro Cosmos prevents the use of Dogmatika Punishment, be alert.  Izna is an impressive card, it can save you from the interruptions during your Normal Summon and it can give you a good amount of resources through its effect.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> It is already mandatory that I promise the recipe, so next month it will be as an extra.  <strong>@Ignister</strong><strong>: </strong>I'll just say it's not a conventional @Ignister recipe, I'll probably post it next month.  <strong>Ogdoabyss:</strong> Thanks to a friend the doors to the Reptile constructions have been opened to me, now I can assure you that one of these days an Ogdoabyss Deck will be published.  <strong>Remakes: </strong>Best Fusion Deck: Nothing has changed, Abyss Actor: Done, and with changes, Infernity Xyz: Possibly I can finish it soon and improve it, Albaz: I'm a little bored with this one.  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment, it cheers me up."

It can topple top decks already so that’s a good sign.,"I made another Dogmatika Cyberdark deck! This is my third one so far so I guess I’m still improving them. This time around I made a suitable side deck for it as well!  The deck is pretty consistent and builds powerful boards with tons of negates and protection, also it uses floodgates to add more pain. With the Dogmatika engine it’s pretty standard combo for winda, the Cyberdark side is a wing it and hopefully end on Cyberdarkness equipped with dragon buster.  I got a side deck too! If you’re playing against a player who tends to need the needs in your side deck fusions you can swap out a fusion and put in fallen for titankad to summon and then you also have super poly in case it’s more of a dragoon turbo deck.  Let me know what you think of the deck in the comments!"

Also, I recently realized that Lyrilusc can use one of the most obscure cards in the game, it’s name is Ghost Fairy Elfobia. Elfobia can reveal a wind monster in your hand and then until the end of your opponent’s next main phase 1 neither player can use the effects of a monster with a higher level than the revealed monster, if Elfobia goes through most of your opponents handtraps (ash,meister, belle, game, and so on) won’t work, it’s like miscell! the reason I chose effect veiler is because it’s a level 1 handtrap so Elfobia won’t stop it. Elfobia doesn’t effect xyz and link monsters so your entire extra deck is safe from it.  I hope you guys like the build! I’m still fairly new to pure Lyrilusc so I am completely open to new suggestions!"

Add Winda....,"This is a Virtual World deck but with a side deck that lets you add a mini Shaddoll engine for going second.  Basic idea is to play Virtual World normally going first, but going second against a heavy extra deck based strategy (Invoked Shaddoll, Dragon Link, etc.), you can swap the Pot of Desires, Foolish Burial Goods, and Called by the Grave for Shadoll Fusion, Schism, Genius, and Dragon to make Apkallone (Apkallone negate + Genius negate + Dragon S/T removal) to help clear opponent's field effects or bait out negates and hand traps before playing through with Virtual World. In addition, with Apkallone up, Muddy Muddragon can be used to go into Winda and setting up Schism to bring out Apkallone during your opponents turn (another negate) and Shenshen can be used to recycle Genius and Dragon to keep making Apkallone (recycles herself) during almost every one of your opponent's turns.  Been working out so far in online testing, but still trying out different things to improve it as getting rid of Foolish Burial Goods going second does hurt consistency."

Melffy's all share the effect:  ""if your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster(s) (except during the Damage Step), or if an opponent's monster targets this card for an attack""  Then they summon a mellfy or add one to your hand. Where after they return to the hand this provides a nice defence but each melffy may only use each effect once witch means some times you will have to rely on cards like rainbow life / mirror force - ish cards  additionally you get to SS all melffy's from your hand at the end of the turn (one of each kind).  So the overall strategy is to lay out your protection then SS as many as possible with spells to summon Joyous Melffys who can attack directly if you detach a card witch allows you to poke for 2000-4000 a turn then on you opponent's turn they can summon Melffys equal to there remaining matirals to set up protection again. And repeat...  Note:  This deck is still Meta and doesn't even has any hand traps."

","A beginner-friendly trap deck oriented around summoning Uria, Lord of Searing Flames to inflict high outputs of damage.  Trap Tactics <ul>  	<li>Metal Reflect Slime and Statue of Anguish Pattern have very high defense, set these early on to have a solid defense while your opponent has weaker cards.</li>  	<li>Abyss Stungray is useful as a stall card because it doesn't get destroyed in battle when activated in defense position, despite it having 0 defense. Remember to be careful of piercing attacks though!</li>  	<li>Use Fake Trap when either Tiki Soul or Tiki Curse is active, due to the Tiki's having a low defense stat when compared to the other cards.</li>  	<li>Booby Trap E is good for when you need just one last card to meet the Uria Summon conditions.</li> </ul> How to Inflict Damage without Uria <ul>  	<li>Zoma the Spirit is a decent way to do damage while you wait to acquire what you need for Uria. When summoned in defense position, if it gets destroyed, it reflects the damage of the attack done to it before going to your GY.</li>  	<li>Use The Calculator as a way to do very surprising amounts of damage to opponents! Remember its damage scales off the level of all the cards on your side of the field x 300.</li>  	<li>It's also not a bad option to have The Calculator out alongside Uria, it'll have at least 3600 attack when summoned.</li> </ul> Uria Advice <ul>  	<li>Remember to use Fallen Paradise whenever Uria is on the field, doing so makes it so Uria cannot be targeted by card effects, and you can draw two cards.</li>  	<li>Try and set Hyper Blaze when you have at least three other traps on the field and Uria in your hand. Hyper Blaze allows you to use <strong>face-down </strong>traps as tributes for Uria's special summon conditions, instead of <strong>face-up</strong> traps. If you've set cards like Fake Trap or Booby Trap E, they can be used as summon materials, and you get to keep your continuous traps on the field.</li>  	<li>Remember with Hyper Blaze active, Uria's damage scales with the number of trap cards in <strong>both </strong>graveyards, meaning Uria can do all the way up to 114,000 damage! Realistically though, with this deck, I've done up to 14,000 damage on more than one occasion.</li> </ul> Extra Advice <ul>  	<li>Use Pot of Duality whenever it appears in your hand just to give you a better chance of getting Uria, a trap card, or whatever else you need.</li>  	<li>Save Mystical Space Typhoon in case of something like Magic Cylinder or another card that counters.</li>  	<li>Use Effect Veiler to stop any card effects that remove The Calculator from the field, and Fallen Paradise does the same for Uria.</li>  	<li>Use Dark Beckoning Beast to summon Chaos Summoning Beast to put Uria into the field instantly! Only use when traps are already in your graveyard, otherwise, its attack will be at 0. Also useful to have Hyper Blaze and Fallen Paradise up and active beforehand.</li>  	<li>Magic Planter is a good way to burn your trap cards to send them to the GY and lets you do more damage when Uria is special summoned.</li> </ul>"

At the age of 18, he decides to leave his hometown of Cassino in Italy to seek his fortune in Britain. He moves to London, struggles between different jobs to finally get a job at a car repair shop thanks to his accuracy and punctuality. <a>https://elukovafinland.blog.se/fast-and-furious-9/</a>  It also turns out that he is extremely skilled behind the wheel and soon a seed is sown for a dream in racing, more specifically Formula 1. But fate has a different plan for the young Emilio. <a>https://elukovafinland.blog.se/hiljainen-paikka-osa-2/</a>  Emilio's accuracy and punctuality is something that also appeals to the cherished and at this time extremely successful director, and he quickly makes a difference and hires the young driver. What at first feels like another odd job for Emilio turns out to be a life-changing story where for 30 years he becomes one of the closest people to one of film history's foremost directors.  <a>https://voyagersfilm.wildapricot.org/news</a>"

Additionally, Springans' core field spell, Great Sand Sea- Gold Golganda, prevents OTK when Time Thief Redoer is threatened.  Taking a closer look at the individual cards, Time Thief Bezel Ship and Time Thief Winder find easy materials to detach from the shared effects of all Springans monster to attach themselves to their archetypal XYZs while Time Thief Chronocorder is happy to trigger itself off Merrymaker and sit under the protection of Gold Golganda. Springans brings the firepower to the table with the unique board destruction effect of Exblower, and enables 4 materials Zeus.  &nbsp;  Cards Choices and Ratio Explanation:  2 Branga: Springans sucks to draw in multiples and level 8 Springans are even more useless when you are cutoff from the field spell. There are 3 major targets to consider when searching, Springans Rockey, Springans Watch, and Springans Blast. Springans Blast is the one you should consider the most, but Merrymaker's effect to send Sprind, the Iron Dragon effect for a follow up is powerful too.  2 Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda : While central to the Springans Strategy, with Pot of Prosperity, Springans Watch and Springans Booty, it is easy to find a copy of the field spell. What you don't want to find is the second copy of Gold Golgonda. It is a dead card that you can not even discard to summon a Springans XYZs.  2 Time Thief Winder - Brings the total target of Time Thief Regulator's target to 4, and is a body that can special summon itself.  1 Time Thief Flyback - The most questionable choice in the list, It finds the missing Chronocorder or Bezel Ship when you make Time Thief Redoer and attaches Time Thief Retrograde from deck when you make Redoer without Regulator.  1 Springans Blast - Worst Discard for Gold Golganda and might brick.  2 The Phantom Knight of Shade Brigandine - Free Level 4 body that enables Redoer. It bricks at 3 :)  Drill Driver Vespenato - DO NOT BANISH this off prosperity, it removes Merrymaker from the board so you can summon the Exblower.  Sprind the Irondash Dragon - Merrymaker can foolish this to grave, and is essentially a +2 when you summon Rockey and add back the Brothers in grave.  Dingirsu, the Orcust of Evening Star - It is possible to make rank 8 in this deck, but it doesn't come up alot, don't hesitate to banish this for prosperity if you don't think you can make it. I like Ding because it outs indestructible cards.  Time Thief Perpetua - Reborns Time Thief Redoer, and help attaches Flyback for removal or a monster when using Zeus.  &nbsp;  Gameplay( What I usually do) :  1: Make Merrymaker and Redoer, depending on the hand, you can choose to summon Captain Sargus for a pop, or make a abyss dweller. Evaluate your hand and see if you have any follow-up.  2. Survive, You usually have a spell negate, a attack negate, and the odd handtrap.  3. Make Exblower and start blasting. Maybe make a Zeus, search Springans Blast and make any Rank4.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Control doesn't have to be set 5 pass.,"My take on modern control with some spice! Recommendations welcome.  Update:  Trying to make the deck have a more reliable end game.  Added some higher attack Punishment targets in the extra.  Underworld goddess is just a 3000 atk option as well as the slight chance of actually pulling it off.  The same can be said about 5-headed link.  Just use it to get over really high atk monsters with Punishment but occasionally you technically could summon it.  Update 2:  Added Redoer as a toolbox option since it synergizes so well with Shade Brigandine.  I should also note that you should banish whatever you don't foresee yourself using with Prosperity.  Update 3:  Removed Vanquish Viking for Network Trap Hole.  Vanquish doesn't seem as relevant after some testing and network is online against most matchups.  It's especially potent against Eldlich.  Update 4:  Dropped a copy of Horror House to add back 1 copy of Vanquish.  This is to prevent some bad hands and technically give the deck a bit more versatility.  I think the new ratio of 2 and 1 is a bit better.  If Konami does add a better option than Vanquish as a secondary Amazement trap, I'll be sure to test it."

All of the continuous spell/traps in the deck have the monsters banish themselves as cost so they can easily avoid danger and easily control the number of monsters on the field, then having them selves special summon back to the field during either player's stand by phase. This deck is mainly good at slowly gaining advantage over time by either searching cards via continuous spell, bouncing monsters back to opponents hand during combat, or by running lots of destruction card such as torrential tribute or needle ceiling then banishing your monsters as cost for other effects to avoid destruction. This deck also HEAVILY relies on many forms of floodgates such <a data-name=""SKILL DRAIN"">SKILL DRAIN</a>, LOSE 1 TURN, MACRO COSMOS, DIMENSION FISSURE, NECROVALLEY, and MYSTIC MINE. Be warned this deck does use lots of complicated mechanics like constantly using the cost of banishing to your favor and a good amount of timing rules need to be learned to play this deck properly.  <span><strong><span>Summary of weather painters</span></strong></span>  <strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>  <strong>ALL</strong> weather monsters have the effect: during the standby phase of the turn after this card was banished from the field to activate a ""The Weather"" card's effect: You can Special Summon this banished card.  <strong><span>Weather Painter</span></strong><span><span> </span><strong>Snow (lvl 3) </strong><span>she is the searcher of the deck, must play at 3 copies, and when she is normal summoned she </span><b>places 1 </b><span><b>weather</b></span><b> canvas </b><span><b>continuous</b></span><b> spell/trap from deck,</b> since she places directly from deck this can work around things like anti-spell fragrance. When normal summoned normally place onto the field her respective weather canvas snow which is the decks searcher.</span>  <strong>Weather Painter Thunder (lvl 3)  </strong>he is the highest atk level 3 weather painter and can send <strong>ANY </strong>face up continuous spell/trap for cost ""including your generic floodgates like skill drain"" to <strong>Place</strong> a different weather canvas from deck to field, must play 3 copies.  <strong>Weather Painter Cloudy (lvl 3)</strong> works in combination with thunder or can be used to protect your weather canvas backrow, if a weather card leaves the field target up to 2 weather canvas' from grave and <strong>Place </strong>them face up, play 2 - 3 copies.  <strong>Weather Painter Sun (lvl 3)</strong> he can special summon himself from grave by sending <strong>Any</strong> continuous spell/trap from field to grave and replacing it with another weathery canvas from hand, he is used incase you need to trigger torrential tribute or for link summoning, play 1.  <strong>Weather painter Rain (lvl 3) </strong>when she is special summoned, place a weather canvas from hand to field, this is used if your opponent destroyed a weather canvas during your turn and you need to activate another canvas for you opponents turn, not particularly useful as both weather painter cloud and aurora can do this job better, play 0 - 1.  <strong>Weather Painter Aurora (lvl 6)</strong> when she is normal summoned place a weather canvas from deck to field, also when she is face up on field your opponent can not target or destroy your weather spell/traps. Play 1 but you will most likely just special summon her from deck using weather canvas rainbow.  <strong>Weather Painter Rainbow (link 3)</strong> she rarely gets played but has an amazing effect, if a weather painter is under a zone she points to, banish that weather painter and <strong>Negate any card effect or activation</strong>. Furthermore she can tribute herself to <strong>Negate special summon. </strong>This deck doesn't ever use the extra deck so just play 3 of her incase you want to use her and don't want her to get hit by pot of extravagance.  <span><strong>Spells/Traps</strong></span>  <strong>ALL </strong>weather spells/traps are continuous and gives the monster directly in front and adjacent to it a quick effect which allows the monster to <strong>Banish themselves as cost, and activates effect in banish zone</strong>. Then during the next standby phase the weather painters have an effect to special summon themselves.  <strong><span>Weather snow canvas </span></strong><span>is the searcher of the deck play 3. When using this card also use it to avoid danger such as if your opponent plays raigeki, simply banish all monsters this spell points to and banish them then search your 1 card, though this card states that you can only search 1 card per turn with this effect, you can still <strong>pay the cost of banishing</strong> your monsters to avoid danger.</span>  <strong>Weather thunder canvas</strong> when a weather painter you control battles a monster, banish the weather painter to return the opponents monster back to hand, this can be useful when playing a kaiju engine to kaiju your opponent then return kaiju back to hand, furthermore this effect is non targeting and can get rid of boss monsters with destruction and targeting immunities. Play 2 - 3.  <strong>Weather cloud canvas </strong>banish your monster then target 1 monster on the field and half its atk and that monster can attack directly, if you don't have weather snow canvas on field and need to quickly avoid danger use this card instead, and this could be used with mystic mine as well, if your opponent can't get less monsters on feild then you, you an easily half one of your monsters and let it attack your opponent directly. Play 0-1.  <strong>Weather sun canvas </strong>banish a weather painter you control then target 1 monster you control and tribute it then special summon 1 weather painter from your hand, do not play this.  <strong>Weather rain canvas</strong> banish a weather painter to target 1 spell/trap you opponent controls and return to hand, this can do a soft spell lock as you can also run anti-spell fragrance forcing your opponent to set their spells then use this card to bounce it back to hand, this can also bounce your opponents mirror forces before you attack. Play 0-1.  <strong>Weather aurora canvas </strong>you can banish a weather painter when anyone adds a card from deck to hand, banish that added card and they draw a new card, can be used to snipe key combo pieces. Play 0-1.  <strong>Weather rainbow canvas</strong> banish a weather painter monster to special summon 1 weather painter from deck to field if your opponent controls at least 1 monster. Normally used to summon aurora, cloud, thunder, summon aurora for dmg or protecting backrow same as cloud, summon thunder to replace rainbow canvas with snow canvas. This card also combos well with torrential tribute as you can easily special a monster from deck then chain that summon with torrential tribute during your opponents turn. Play 3.  <span><strong><span>Deck Techs</span></strong></span>  <span><strong>Board Nukes</strong></span>  <span>There are a few ways to easily play board nukes in this deck but mainly playing torrential tribute and needle ceiling. For <strong>needle ceiling</strong> you can simply wait out as long as possible before activating needle ceiling then nuking the board, then chain all monsters on the field by banishing themselves for cost to either search a card from deck using the weather canvas snow or by targeting 1 monster on the field  and halving their atk with cloudy canvas. <strong>Torrential tribute</strong> can also be activated extremely easily in this deck as well, by using the weather canvas rainbow, you can ""at the end of opponent main phase 1 or start of battle phase"" special summon from deck any weather painter monster then activate torrential tribute, then simply banish all monsters on your field as cost to activate your continuous spell/traps. Furthermore <strong>Nibiru</strong> can be easily played around as well similar to needle ceiling, right at the end of main phase or beginning of battle phase  simply first activate effect of weather rainbow canvas, then Nibiru, then banish your remaining monsters with weather canvas snow.</span>  <span><strong>Mystic Mine</strong></span>  Since weather painters can easily control the number of monsters on your side of the field at all times, mystic mine can be played around. To use this card you must always have to guess how many monsters your opponent will have on board at all time, if you know your opponent does not play generic link monsters can cant link all of their monsters for a single monster then you can leave more monsters on your side of the field, else just banish all of your monsters on field using snowy canvas or cloudy canvas effect. Furthermore you can easily get rid of mystic mine at the end of your opponents turn by either using <strong>needle ceiling</strong> then banishing your monsters away or by using weather rainbow canvas to special summon a monster from deck and then activating <strong>torrential tribute</strong>, then chain and banish all your monsters again to avoid destruction, at the end of your opponents turn both players will not have any monsters each and mystic mine is destroyed.  <span><strong>Floodgates</strong></span>  <strong><span>Skill</span><span> drain </span></strong><span>can be played around as ALL of your weather painters will first <strong>banish themselves for cost, </strong>then <strong>Activate in banish zone,</strong> this is good as skill drain <strong>Only</strong> negates monsters on field. Similarly <strong>lose 1 turn</strong> does the same however requires the activation for you to have no special summoned monsters on field, to work around this the turn you set lose 1 turn, banish all your monsters first, then on opponent standby phase activate lose 1 turn first then special summon all of your banished weather painters back. </span>  <strong>Macro cosmos, Dimensional fissure, and Necrovalley</strong> aren't going to be an issue for you as no monsters should ever go to grave except potentially weather painter sun but he can float back to the field or by using weather painter thunders effect to destroy an old continous spell/trap and  place a new canvas with weather painter cloud on field to bring back destroyed weather spells/traps.  <strong>Anti-Spell </strong><b>fragrance</b> can be played around as weather painters thunder, snow, and aurora all place weather canvas' directly from deck to field and <strong>DOES NOT</strong> <strong>activate them</strong>.  <span><strong>Hand traps</strong></span>  <span>Play any hand traps you desire as you can easily empty your field to resolve gamma, and you don't need a graveyard so dimensional shifter wont effect you. Herold hand traps could also work as <strong>ALL</strong> weather painters are faries.</span>  <strong><span>General traps</span></strong>  <strong><span>Mirror force </span></strong><span>line up especially drowning as you can easily banish all monsters on your field leaving you wide open for a direct attack thus allowing you to use drowning, mainly use mirror force line up if you are getting constantly monster destruction on you field and your opponent can easily otk you when your board is empty.</span>  <strong>Waking the dragon and artifact sanctum</strong> can both be used to blind set if your opponent regularly uses lighting storm, and artifact sanctum can also get into artifact scythe for an extra deck lock.  <span><strong>Strategy</strong></span>  First and foremost this is a <strong>Control deck </strong>and is mainly relying on wildling down your opponent and poking them to death, it cannot otk even on an empty board. Your main strategy is to stall and hold out as long as possible before triggering you board nukes then banish your weather painter then attack on your next turn. With cards like weather canvas thunder you can get rid of lots of boss monsters that have destruction and targeting immunities by simply bouncing them back to hand. Since majority of the floodgates are monster negation stalling out should be even easier as you steadily gain advantage over time. The deck list currently shown is for going blind in a match so it is middle ground for either going first or second without an issue however it is not optimized for either.  <strong>When going first,</strong> side in more floodgates and board nukes can you can easily sit on them and wait for your opponent to act. Hand traps could be useful for going first however hand traps are just 1 time use so floodgates are greatly more valued as it can last for multiple turns.  <strong>When going second, </strong>running 3 mystic mines an terraforming is necessary as you opponent most likely has a large board. Reducing the number of trap field nukes would be good as you won't be able to activate them right away, but keeping a few copies wont hurt as you can easily stall while getting ready to use those traps on your opponents turn. Siding in more hand traps is greatly valued and dark ruler no more, black hole, or raigeki can always help as well. Kaiju package would also be useful as they can easily be returned to your hand once a turn so you can easily kaiju 2 trouble card every turn.  <strong>Siding</strong> when siding never lower the amount of your standard weather painter monsters or spells/traps that will greatly reduce your consistency mainly focus on all of the tech cards, the weather painter portion of the deck only takes up 19 cards, the remaining 21 can be switched based on the match up but be cautious when siding out your draw power."

Whether it succeeds on other fronts is a completely different matter. <a>https://blockhelden.de/community/profile/fastandfuriousgerman/</a>  Just like in the games, the premise is that humanity must take part in a battle tournament against the evil kingdom Outworld, in order to prevent Emperor Shang Tsung from conquering the earth. However, a prophecy says that a group of fighters will unite and defeat the darkness.  <a>https://treasurechest.com.ua/community/profile/fastandfurious9/</a>  Here we meet the mediocre MMA fighter and brand new character Cole Young (Lewis Tan), who is suddenly chased by the emperor's icy right hand Sub-Zero. Cole has a birthmark on his chest that resembles a dragon's head, like a legendary warrior who fought in tournaments hundreds of years ago. <a>https://treasurechest.com.ua/community/profile/wrathofman/</a>  After escaping the cold villain, he meets other fighters from the games such as Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Jax (Mehcad Brooks) and Kano (Josh Lawson) with the same mark on their body, which turns out to be a sign that they are selected to fight for the fate of the earth. <a>https://www.verticalvic.fr/community/profile/fastandfurious9france/</a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>&nbsp;</div></blockquote>"

The basic combo requires just any two Igknights and Zefraath(which I have 3 of + 6 searchers) in your opening hand. Pendulums were hit hard because of master rule 5 so isolde is there to help open up as much zones for extra deck pendulum summon as possible and search a scale. The deck is best suited for going second, it can be quite easily crippled by negation. Ash hitting Igknight search effect for example is very devastating. But once you establish your negate board, it's very hard for opponent to break it. Even Dark Ruler No More doesn't help against the counter traps. The deck does tend to brick a bit more often than I'd like it to. It also can't run much handtraps since it requires quite a lot to set up. </span>  https://youtu.be/RplQzmI1Z_Y"

The free special summons from the Battlewasps help make Picofalena and get your combo rolling. Ideal endboard is a 3-mat Baboozling Gossip Shadow, 3-mat Apollousa, Cicada King, and Seraphim Papillon.  Now on to the card breakdown.  The Inzektors:  Dragonfly: The reason this deck works. Turns out having a special summon effect that's not once per turn is <strong>pretty strong</strong>. Who'd have thought. Summon Centipedes with this until you run out of them, then summon whatever, you're just going for link/xyz materials.  Centipede: The searcher. Once again an example of why cards are usually once per turn. Use this to search what you need, usually the Giga-Inzektors or Zektkaliber to pop with Hornet to get more Dragonfly summons.  Ladybug: The most compact way to trigger Centipede or Dragonfly, and you can Insect Imitation it into a Dragonfly to start your combo. Also good for level manipulating into the ED Inzektors.  Hornet: The Big Guns. Use this to wipe your opponent's whole board, or pop the Giga-Inzektors and Zektkaliber.  Giga-Mantis: Equips from hand so you can equip it to Dragonfly or Centipede for more effects, plus it summons from grave when you pop it with Hornet.  Giga-Weevil: Once again, equips from hand to bypass the once per turn for Dragonfly and Centipede, plus summons from grave. Slightly less useful unique effect compared to Mantis, when are you gonna need a 2600 DEF Inzektor? Never, that's when.  Zektkaliber: Equips from hand. You should know why that's good by now. Also lets you get Inzektors in your grave back into your hand for discard fodder.  Next, the Battlewasp engine.  Sting the Poison: Searches the other two, plus can be Insect Imitationed into the good Inzektors.  Twinbow the Attacker: Special Summons itself from hand, plus it's level 3 so you can use it for rank 3s. Locks you into insects though, so ideally use it after you've set up your Apollousa/Bamboozle.  Pin the Bullseye: Specials from hand, good for making Picofalena, and doesn't lock you into insects. What's not to love? Plus, it has the most powerful card in the game, Sparks, built in!  Summoning Swarm: Did someone say Soul Charge?  Finally, the oddball stuff.  Digital Bug Websolder: Level 3 and summons level 3 insects from hand, which is <em>checks notes</em> 40% of the deck and most of your good monsters.  Insect Imitation: Turns Parasite Paranoid, Sting the Poison, and Ladybug into Dragonfly or Centipede.  Parasite Paranoid: Stops your opponent's monster from targeting your bugs, plus is a Imitation target if push comes to shove.  Foolish Burial: Searches Hornet and Ladybug.  Now, on to the extra deck.  Borreload Savage Dragon: Easy omni-negate. This deck makes level 8 synchros pretty easily.  Hama the Conquering Bow: OTK tool.  Azusa the Ghost Bow: A stepping stone synchro, plus it re-summons itself if you kill something with Hama.  Herald Of the Arc Light: An omni-negate and Macro Cosmos welded together. Can be a little inconvenient to summon.  Martial Metal Marcher: Level 3 for rank 3 plays, synch Sting and Pin into this then revive Sting.  Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus: It's Zeus, your opponent will not be able to keep anything on the field.  Inzektor Exa-Stag: Can be a Big Dumb Beater&#x2122; or yoink something valuable out of your opponent's graveyard. Plus it can trigger Dragonfly/Centipede and get rid of an opponent's card at the same time.  Cicada King: A negate that can summon an insect from grave.  Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: A negate, plus a good rank-up for Zeus considering it can have 3-4 mats.  Borrelsword: An easy OTK tool, you'll have no problem getting enough mats.  Apollousa: You can pretty easily get 3-4 negates on this thing.  Seraphim Papillion: Quick effect insect res. Good for triggering Sting or setting up a Dragonfly.  Crystron Halqifibrax: Turns a Sting into a Papillion.  Picofalena: Starts your combos. Get a Hornet or Ladybug from deck, or if you're really in a pickle a Dragonfly to res next turn with Papillion.  &nbsp;  Now go and make Weevil proud."

Forbidden drip evenly match and lightning storm are great at breaking apart most decks turn 1  After breaking it getting out dragoon is not hard but not a guarantee. Chance of having no follow up is too high.  Not enough starters to be as good as top meta decks but def not a bad deck  Also very expensive for not being top. Might as well buy a meta deck imo

You can also go into Borrelsword right away, or Knightmare Phoenix / Linkuriboh if you need to. You can start setting up ABC now, getting the field spell out is very important. ABC needs a few turns, and Appliancer can stay alive for a turn or two generally with Laundry Dragon spam. Storming Mirror Force and Quaking Mirror Force can actually put a large wrench in opponent's plans as these are non-targeting. We also have a Magic Cylinder, and it works pretty well. Because this back is pretty backrow heavy, we play triple Waking the Dragon to catch a Harpie's Feather Duster or any sort of spell/trap removal as it allows us to go into Ultimate Falcon which can often be GG. I run two ABC Dragon Busters beacuse I am limited in the extra deck, and we can go into two sometimes. Appliancer Reuse is like a monster reborn and helps us go into our Lanudry Dragon play again. Appliancer Electrilyical World makes the Appliancer plays a lot more consistent, but the real star here is triple Union Hangar as it is crucial for ABC and beacuse of that we also run 1 Terraforming.  As for my side deck, Lancea is pretty standard, counters Dino, Pankratops is self explanatory, dirt cheap, Kaijus help for something like a boosted Dragoon that not even Ultimate Falcon can beat, Effect Veiler is here because we don't have the budget for Ash Blossom or even Droll or Ghost Ogre. Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon is a huge easy to summon beatstick with ABC, but this can be swapped out for whatever you like. 2 Cosmic Cyclone for extra removal, 3 Solemn Warnings because we're on a tight budget, and 1 Red Lotus. The side deck is up to you, as it can really just depend on what you want to counter, or what sees a lot of play at your Locals.  Overall a really fun to play deck, I know it's not very competitve, but it really can put in some work (I've gotten Borrelsword + 2 ABC out before quite a few times in testing, and you could even get a Raidraptor out) and it's dirt cheap. (would be even cheaper before YT videos got made on Appliancer) I hope you enjoyed this deck list."

The only reason i'm not running 3 is because it can brick a lot easier if you run more than 2  3x Wayne: Insanely good starter, fetches Medallion on summon and is the perfect target for Zuijin's effects.  3x Revealer: Also a really good card, fetches Hexa Spirit and get's your combos going.  2x Speaker: Only reason i'm not running 3 of this is because i didn't want to play 41 cards, but other than that you should definitely run it at 3 because its a free body on board and can give you a token if you need it (it doesn't come up too often but it's still nice to have).  3x Prior: Free extender, helps frog combos and can get cards like Wayne and Raiho beck from the grave, the main reason the two have synergy.  1x Zuijin: mostly just the target to send off of Hexa Spirit and if you see it in your hand, discard fodder, but it's also an extender with Wayne being the perfect target for them.  2x Hexa Spirit: the tuner for Revealer to special from deck with, use it's effect to send Zuijin or Prior if you cant send Zuijin.  1x Fishborg launcher: My target tuner of choice for Halifibrax, basically just jest synchron for waters  3x Swap Frog: Best frog. Its a free special summon and if you open Zuijin it's the perfect discard fodder, plus it dumps off a frog on summon in addition to a self bounce for a second normal summon for a frog.  2x Ronintoadin: would play 3 but i didn't want to play 41 cards, its your frog extender that is used for Toadally materials  3x Dupe Frog: Forces Attack targets to him which can be handy to stop an OTK from something like a Borrelsword and it searches a frog when sent to grave. <h3>SPELLS:</h3> Monster Reborn, enough said  Called by the Grave: this deck has trouble playing around handtraps, this is the perfect answer to them and at worst you have a D.D Crow when needed.  3x Medallion: ROTA for the Ice Barriers, that's really all i need to say  3x Freezing Chains: A monster reborn for the Ice Barriers and has some nifty protection that comes up every once in a while.  2x Winds: this card is handy to have and can setup both your grave and field with Ice Barrier monsters you need. <h3>TRAPS:</h3> 3x Dinomischus: The best Paleo card in the archetype and is a free summon for Toad plays or link climbing  2x Strike: one of the best traps in the format negating monster effects and summons. <h3>EXTRA DECK:</h3> Trish Zero: non-targeting banish removal which is really good in a format like this one, also it can summon trish from deck but it's not that good.  White Aura Bihamut: this may seem like a weird option but its a free token generator that is a major beatstick that can help seal in games or just used as Coral Anemone fodder, which is also good.  Trish: play it at 3 if it ever goes back, Some of the best removal in the game from each of the resources to consider that doesn't target  Dragite: Don't know whether to play 2 or not but it's a Spell/Trap negate for free so there's that.  White Aura Whale: Literally a Mirror Force on summon and can double attack along with Piercing to seal games. Plus when it's sent to the GY, you can just bring it back and make it a tuner if your into that!  2x Coral Dragon: This may seem like a weird option but hear me out, the main reason i play it is because it's a tuner synchro that you can just play for some removal if you need it and then synchro again for a free draw! It's one of my favourite things about the deck.  Desert Locusts: your target off of Halqifibrax, its a free hand rip and another synchro summon on your opponent's turn  2x Toadally Awesome: The main reason to run the Frog engine, it has everything you could really ask for in a card.  Abyss Dweller: Locks the Grave from effects so it's a handy card to have especially in this format.  Bahamut Shark: Gets toad out if your frogs can't.

This series is not made by a professional, so bear with me. With all of that being said, I would like to welcome you to...</span> <h1>Reviving Old Powers</h1> <h2>Deck 2 - Magical Musket</h2> This deck may seem weak, with only one extra deck monster and it's strongest monster having 2500 ATK/DEF, but this deck can defeat monsters such as Red Supernova Dragon, Red Eyes Black Dragoon, and Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus. It all comes down to getting the right monster on the field with the right spells and traps to back them up. Now that it has been said, let's get into it! <h3>Monsters</h3> <span>We should probably go by level and work our way up, ending with our Link monster. But first, I should tell you that all Magical Musket monsters have the effect allowing you to use any Magical Musket spell or trap on any turn, at any time, from your hand! Also, they all have a second effect, but this effect can only be activated by starting a spell or trap in that card's column. Caspar can give you any card from your deck and add it to your hand, while Doc can get that card from your Graveyard. Kidbrave allows you to discard one card and then add two cards to your hand. This gives you the opportunity to refresh your hand when you are in a tough spot. Starfire helps you get any Magical Musket monster except for Zakiel on the field in Defence position, perfect for a Link summon. Calamity helps you get a monster back from the grave, while Wild gets three cards from the grave and puts them in the Deck. Zakiel, our strongest monster by ATK and DEF, allows you to draw cards equal to the number of spells and traps activated by you on your opponent's turn. Finally, we have Max, which lets us either get spells and traps equal to opponent monsters, or summon monsters equal to opponent spells and traps. Do I have you hooked yet, or do I need to continue? Continue? Ok...</span> <h3>Spells/Traps</h3> <span>Now we get to the part that makes this deck powerful. All of the following cards I will talk about require a Magical Musket monster on the field to be able to use them. Anyway, Cross Domination can take one monster on the field and destroy all of their ATK and DEF, as well as negating their effect for the turn. Steady hands does the opposite, giving one Magical Musket monster a double on their ATK and DEF. Crooked Crown lets you summon one Magical Musket monster from your deck, while Fiendish Deal makes it where your Magical Musket monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects. Last Stand negates a trap or spell, while Desperado destroys one monster on the field. Finally, we head to Dancing Needle, which banishes 3 cards from either Graveyard.</span> <h3>Lore</h3> <span>Usually I would like to have more here, but I could not find that much on the web. From what I can tell, this deck is based off of a German opera by the name of Der Freichutz. A Freichutz is someone who makes a deal with the Devil and aquires 7 bullets. 6 bullets are completely in the user's grasp, while the seventh is in the control of the Devil. Most of these cards also share looks and names with people of Western folklore, such as Kidbrave being Billy the Kid. They also share a characteristic among the cards themselves. All of the monsters have a bluish arm holding their weapon.</span> <h3>Final Notes</h3> <span>I have really enjoyed writing this article, and I also like looking at the comments I get. Thank you for the feedback, and I will try to improve my deck. I might be a bit late on my next articles, as I will be travelling. Now for a hint on my next deck... Oh come on, look at yourself! Thanks for reading, and goodnight.</span>"

The deck is supposed to mill itself to have fodder on the grave for berserkion's effect and summon block dragon and valkyrion with delta. Am recently coming back and properly learning the game tried to fit negates to accommodate the modern meta a bit. Any suggestions or improvements for the deck or just deck building ill appreciate the comments  <hr />  The deck banks on its excavates and searchers to get as many magnet warriors on the hand grave or fild to activate their effects to get berserkeion out as soon as humanly possible and maybe mill a valkyrion special summon with delta. Once berserkion is out mill for the king of the swamp if it isnt already in the hand for a poly search and get imperion out with support of the extra deck and hand traps to keep him on the field.

OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong>  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/relyrPUi4hg  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Al final se necesitará varios dragones, pero éstos son fáciles de spamear en la baraja. Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y traer a Brotaur para obtener a Rescue Ferret.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Dragunity Arma Gram: </strong>Se invoca desde la mano o cementerio removiendo 2 dragones del cementerio. Es un buen target de Foolish Burial / Dragon Shrine y no es un ladrillo!</li>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial. Además, cuando se va del campo, nos da un robo!</li>  	<li><strong>Linkbelt Wall Dragon: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando hacemos Link Summon, pero por su efecto, debemos hacerlo cuando invocamos a Striker Dragon y usarlo como material para Romulus.</li>  	<li><strong>Black Dragon Collapserpent: </strong>Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de luz, además nos trae a Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>White Dragon Wyverburster:</strong> Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de oscuridad, además nos trae a Collapserpent.</li>  	<li><strong>Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm:</strong> Se invoca gratis del cementerio, por lo que es un target de Foolish Burial y Dragon Shrine.</li>  	<li><strong>Starliege Dragon Seyfert: </strong>Una invocación normal excelente, ya que con su efecto tendremos en mano a Collapserpent o Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>Rokket Tracer: </strong>Normal Summon de último recurso, además de tener excelentes interacciones con Section Boot y Absorouter.</li>  	<li><strong>Crusadia Draco: </strong>Se invocará gratis hacia donde apunte una flecha link. También es buen Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Defrag Dragon: </strong>Se invoca gratis descartando un monstruo.</li>  	<li><strong>Black Metal Dragon: </strong>Se usa de Normal Summon. Nos añade al Red Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, que es un +1.</li>  	<li><strong>One For One: </strong>Nos trae a Black Metal Dragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Shrine y Foolish Burial: </strong>Pueden enviar a Darkwurm o Arma Gram al cementerio.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>Nos da un cuerpo adicional.</li>  	<li><strong>Chaos Space: </strong>Efecto similar a Seyfert, pero sin gastar la Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Quick Revolve: </strong>Nos trae a Rokket Tracer gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Guardragon of the World Legacy: </strong>Efecto similar a Monster Reborn, pero además nos permite mover a un dragón (por lo general un Guardragon).</li>  	<li><b>Living Fossil: </b>Invoca algo del cementerio, pero lo destierra cuando deja el campo, por lo que no se debe traer piezas de combo como Phalanx.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Ravine: </strong>Funciona de una peor manera que Dragon Shrine / Foolish Burial, pero puede servir de extender.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene un burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente, igual perderá.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene muy pocos bricks/garnets</li>  	<li>El deck tiene extenders muy poderosos, por lo que es posible que sobren recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de varias adiciones específicas a la mano. Si nos niegan alguna, será gg.</li>  	<li>Por la naturaleza del deck, éste no tiene acceso a protección.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck consume varios extenders, por lo que es necesaria una buena mano para realizar los combos.</li> </ul>"

With all of these new cards I felt obligated to make a fleur deck. This build has a combo oriented strategy and 10 cards to open horse of the floral knights which is a one card chevalier de fleur or baroness de fleur in some cases. You can also occasionally summon road warrior who can set up all sorts of plays despite being a monster that’s kinda hard to get out road warrior is always well worth it for it’s powerful ability. I considered synchro overtake but ruled against it because you also like to summon Isolde and halq a lot.  Thanks for checking this deck out and have a good day!

This deck is fairly co,"<strong>This deck has two different win conditions: Decking your opponent out or getting Exodia. </strong> Before we go into the serious and technical stuff, consider making some tea or whatever you consider your favorite beverage. Your duel is going to take a while. Sit back, relax, put on some slow jazz, and duel! <strong>  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- </strong>  Keep in mind you're playing with &amp; against tons of negates, so it's very important to know how a chain works: The higher the number (that is, if that card was activated last), the sooner the effect will activate. For instance: If your opponent activates Typhoon to destroy your Mystic Mine, his chain number will be 1. If you activate Magic Jammer after, your chain number will be 2. Your effect is going to go first, destroying the Typhoon and rendering its effect useless, keeping your Mystic Mine safe and sound. Bottom line: Read the cards.  If you would, please take a closer look at your side deck. It mostly includes cards that have a card-drawing effect. If you feel that you can go a bit more aggressive vs an opponent and that you can win earlier, feel free to put in more of these cards. However, if your objective is to eat glue and drink gouache, this is the deck for you.  The obvious weak spot of this deck are decks that can send Exodia to the GY, or banish it. Be wary of that, and make sure to deck accordingly!  Other cool cards that you can use are:  - Burial from a Different Dimension (if your opponent has banishing cards, and they actually manage to banish a part of your Exodia) - Monster Reborn (opponents that run Card Destruction or Morphing Jar can sometimes send Exodia parts to the GY. Always a good idea to have something in mind. I picked Monster Reborn, but feel free to add monsters with effects too, such as Legion the Fiend Jester). - Exodia Incarnate/Exodia Necross + Contract with Exodia  (if all else fails it's good to have this as a hail-mary, but I wouldn't strategize around it). - Battle Fader (the monster equivalent of Threatening Roar and Waboku). - Skill Drain (negate the effects of face-up monsters. Pretty cool.) - Mirror Force - Performapal Kuribohble - Mad Reloader (trades 2 cards from your hand with 2 cards from the deck. Really cool since you can attack a silent wobby with it and just kill yourself, activating its effect). - Raigeki - Gold Sarcophagus (basically handpick one card from your deck, pretty much always gonna be mystic mine, and add it to your hand after 1 turn). - Sangan - Witch of the Black Forest - Dark Bribe (although I really think you don't need more disables LOL) - Nibiru: Primal Being (for those poopooheads that like to summon 8 monsters in a row) - Infinite Impermanence (EXTREMELY good card. I can also see this working in the main deck). - Unending Nightmare (destroys lingering spell/trap cards. Kinda cool vs Cauldron if someone is playing that). - Ash Blossom (Also extremely powerful vs combo decks. Negates drawing effects from monsters, spells, and traps. Consider playing this in the main deck as well or side decking it) - Super Polymerization (Listen, your extra deck is just there for discards and memes, but if you'd like, you can definitely surprise your opponent by pulling out your huge dong and summoning a 2.8k ATK monster. How's that sound?) - Toll (pay 500 LP to declare an attack. Overall a pretty trash card but I can see it working). - Reload (hand reset if you're feeling spicy) - Supply Squad (great for comboing with Sangan, Witch, Battle Fader, Performapal, and Mad Reloader. If those monsters are destroyed in battle, draw a card. Really really good if you're going with the monster approach). - Obliterate!!! (This card is almost exclusively used with Exodia Incarnate and Necross, so definitely combo it with them).  That's all I can think of right now. As you can see, the further I invest into this guide, the more my sanity fades. Just by quoting the names of the cards I start remembering the countless hours I spent looking at the screen and clicking ""End Phase"".  Have fun frustrating people and losing friends.

To enable this, we run a few cards to set him up. We combine his ability with a lot of power spells, mostly fusion spells to ensure his effect goes off hard. Most of the spells however can also just regularly be used, like Red-Eyes Fusion or Neos Fusion. We run a few garnets in the deck to facilitate these spells, but a lot of them have other uses like being targets for Dark Calling. On top of that, the Predaplant link also gives us consisten access to the various fusion spells to make for a powerful fusion powerhouse."

Easy Battle Butler + Rusty Bardiche + Knightmare Gryphon just by using Prank-Kids as starter while still having staples lol,"https://youtu.be/nTI8uuFE0Jg  Phantom Knight and Ogdoadic are 2 of my favorite archetypes. Together, they increase Prank-Kids combo ceiling as extenders. Watch the combo in the video below. You only need <strong>2 Prank-Kids cards + lv4</strong> (normal summon, Prank-Kids Prank discard, and random lv4). Combo is surprisingly consistent because we run 18 Prank-Kids cards with 16 lv4 monsters (Rocksies acts as both, so as the field spell and Terraforming).  Pros: More negation, floodgate, and recursion.  Cons: Doesn't solve the ""dying to Ash"" problem.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

These monsters are extremely powerful in how easy they can be summoned and provide key access to the Rank 7 engine of Big Eye and Volnigesh. You can use Tempest to ditch a card in hand that is not useful to grab a copy of pet dragon. <h2>Best Harpie Girl</h2> Acting as a bridge between the two engines is one of the strongest cards in the deck: Harpie Channeler, which (with a discard) instantly become a Rank 7 XYZ with Pet Dragon. However, she can also grab one of the other level 4 Harpie monsters, for either a Link play into Harpie Channeler and Simorgh OR into a Rank 4 XYZ such as Zerofyne and Lightning Chidori. <h2>Harpie Searchers</h2> One of the best targets for Harpie Channler are the various searchers: Harpie Perfumer and Oracle. Note that these cards are once per turn and Oracle is in the end-phase. Which can instantly bring to hand spells such as Alluring Mirror, Feather Rest, Hunting Ground and (most importantly) Elegant Egotist. <h2>Elegant Egotist &gt; Instant Fusion</h2> Elegant Egotist is a non-once per turn card that can summon a Harpie Lady from the deck, making it a costless Instant Fusion. Note: the various Harpie cards are only treated as Harpie Lady when in the Grave, which limits the targets.  I have personally chosen Harpie Lady 1 because a 300 ATK boost has helped on ocassion overcome a larger enemy. There are other builds which use the original normal Harpie Lady and the spell Unexpected Dai, however because of the Windwitch engine we have decided to go for the effect variant (since you cannot summon Ice Bell and activate Unexpected Dai). <h2>Which Windwitch is which?</h2> The Windwitch engine adds an additional degree of power to the deck as it Snow Bell provides protection and Ice &amp; Glass give access to powerful Synchro monsters. The typical combination is: <ol>  	<li>Summon Ice Bell on an empty field.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Glass Bell from deck.</li>  	<li>Search Snow Bell with Glass Bell's effect.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Snow Bell.</li>  	<li>Synchro Glass and Ice into Ignister Pegasus (feel free to destroy opponents backrow at this point).</li>  	<li>Synchro Pegasus and Snow Bell into Clear Wing.</li> </ol> At the end of this one card combo you have a Wind Pegasus in grave to shuffle cards into the deck and a Crystal Clear Wing which cannot be destroyed, and you still have your normal summon! <h2>The Harpie and the floodgate.</h2> There are two additional monsters in the maindeck that we have yet to talk about, the first is Harpie Harpist, which is a perfect target for Harpie's Pet Dragon's effect to send monsters (since it searches during the end phase when sent) and provides disruption on the normal summon. The final is Barrier statue of the Storms, one of the few floodgate's left untouched this can be devastating when summoned as you are nearly unimpeded by its effects. However, in a match against a wind deck it is an obvious side option. <h2>Spells and Traps: Pop Hysteric sign</h2> The spells and traps are rather straightforward. Hysteric sign and Alluring Mirror exist to be destroyed by card effects for their fantastic summoning/searching (esspecially Hysteric Sign). The optimal way to destroy them would be through the Hunting Ground Field spell or through Harpie Conductor. Feather rest is a brilliant draw card that has gotten better with the new version of Pet Dragon. Hysteric Party is a dangerous card that is a turn 3 or 4 move to recover from a board wipe or to push for game. Finally, Feather storm is one of the best negation traps esspecially because it can be activated from the hand, even during your opponents turn. <h1>Extra Deck</h1> <h2>Synchro Monsters</h2> <h3>Just here for the Windwiches</h3> As previously mentioned Ignister Pegasus and Clear Wing exist for the Wind Witch engine's combo. The Speedroid synchro is present in case you have Snowbell + a level 4 Harpie monster, that way you can have a monster that is immune to destruction and gains attack. This engine is designed to be unobtrusive in the extra deck so that it might potentially be sided out. <h3>When is a tuner not a tuner? When it's a Harpie!</h3> The newest Harpie synchro has a large amount of power behind it capable of being being a complusary exacuation device forever. This monster is very easy to summon, as it can treat a Harpie as a tuner which means that it is one Elegant Egotist or Channler away from being summoned. However, it can also be brought out through Glass Bell + a Harpie or a Dragon + Snow Bell. Finally, as it is treated as a Harpie Lady in the Grave it can be brought back though Hysteric Party (as long as it was summoned normally first). <h2>Link Monsters</h2> There are two Link monsters: Harpie Conductor which serves as another means of destroying your own spells (which is a good thing), it provides protection and a combo's well with the Harpie Synchro. The other link monster is Simorgh, which serves as a dangerous powerhouse in the deck, providing another layer of protection for the monsters it points to. Additionally it can summons monsters during the End Phase (of both players turns), a popular choice is Barrier statue or Perfumer (or if you are desperate for an attck boost then Harpie Lady 1). <h2>XYZ monsters</h2> <h3>Rank 7: Here be Dragons ... again.</h3> There are two Rank 7 monsters: Big Eye which can snatch a monster perminantly (an incredible effect) and Volnigesh (whose effect is Quick because of the method it is summoned). Depending on the situation either might be useful, however you cannot overlay into Divine Arsenal as both of these monsters cannot attack the turn you use their effects. Regardless they are strong standalone cards. <h3>Rank 4: Wind Winged-Beast's have some amazing non-generic's.</h3> There are two non-generic XYZ monsters: Lightning Chidori (who can spin cards to the top and bottom of the decks) and Zerofyne (who can Skill Drain all monsters on the field and then gain a huge boost from all cards, including your own). The prevalence of Harpies means that these are effectively generic. Finally we have Excition Knight and Abyss Dweller, which to this day are among some of the most powerful rank 4's designed. <h1>Side Deck</h1> <h2>I wanna play Harpie's not Windwitches!</h2> The side deck contains additional Barrier statues, a set of Swallow's nest's (which are designed to summon them) and 3 XYZ monsters. These are designed to replace the entire Windwitch engine, Synchro's and all. The Utopia cards are designed for a powerful OTK whilst the Barrier statue locks them down. <h2>Need more self destruction? Need less? we got you covered.</h2> Droplet is placed in for additional methods to destroy your own spells and traps. Finally Elborz is a powerful field spell, which works better in the pure variant within the Windwiches, it can facilitate and additional normal summon (which can be a barrier statue or a Harpist) and it also serves a method to save the Simorgh Link from battle as well as providing an additional attack boost. Recommend siding either of these cards if your opponent does not run many spells and traps (as they can replace the Hunting ground's)."

Pot of desires used for thinning deck and Imperial order is meant to mix with Gryphon.  Side deck and extra are simple, added Luster solder recently as an out for alot of stuff and because I try to summon Chaos Ruler alot, this card basically makes this deck work really well. Alot of going second options in case I am forced to go second and most are light so I can use them as materials for chaos.  Jinzo in side deck, for fun and also in case I run into trap decks."

I really wonder what Konami was thinking when they made this archetype. In theory, some of the cards have potential and they have amazing art. A solid Link-2 could solve almost all of the decks issues right now. But as it is, you have to be a masochist to voluntarily play this deck. Especially picking this deck up in real life would be a terrible decision. If you seriously invest into this deck, do everyone around you a favor and please get some help."

You accomplish this through cards like Lightning Storm, Raigeki, HFD, and IKS.  Your best and most important card is B.E.F. Zelos, as it enables the entire deck to function. Your main ways of OTKing are through cards like limiter removal and getting big kaijus like jizikiru on board. If you don't manage to OTK, all is still well, the deck has an excellent grind, albeit without much interaction. Turns out its hard to out cards that get replaced after destruction and cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects.  Note: Extra is pretty flexible, most of it never comes up, you may want to add rank 9s and replace the 7s with 6s. The only ""mandatory"" cards in the ED are probably the Cydra cards, but even those can be replaced."

Want to spam your opponent with huge dragons? Look no further!,"The goal of this deck is simple; open Crimson Resonator, and another level 4 monster, preferably a monster that can search a self summoning level 4, like Witch of the Black Forest, Dawn Knight or even Damage Juggler. Then you go into a board of atleast Abyss + Bane. If you open Synchro Call or Trap Trick one could even go into King Calamity in the draw phase of the opponent, virtually FTKing against most decks. Big synchros like Nirvana High Paladin ensure you can OTK the next turn."

The side deck is made so I can chose between 3 play styles and it has some specific cards so that I have an answer for (almost) any situation. This doesn't make it meta. Meta decks can beat it more than 50% of time by brute force. And the reason is because they can play a lot of hand traps and still be consistent. Cyber angel decks just can't do that.

In case you're going 2nd you can use the numeron engine to force your opponent's disruptions, if you win the dice-roll you definitely want to go first and finish the game with the numeron engine or activating scapegoats in the opponent's end phase (keep in mind if you use condemned witch during your opp's turn you wont be able to activate scapegoat, unless the opponent negates it).  The side deck and maindeck traps can be switched for any counter trap that could be more effective depending on the format or what you currently own except for the solemn traps that are a must have in most of the situations.  When you're side decking its best to take out 2 artemists for the 2 pathfinders and add the 2 numeron callings, broken line is also there to switch some counter traps for going 2nd (you just set them where your opponent has cards)."

Their biggest issue lies in Emergency Teleport and Reasoning still being limited.These being at 1 definitely hold them back sadly, but even with those at 1 new cards like Pot of Extravagence breathe new life into them.If you like a strategy focused around big monsters from the main deck but don’t really like going all in on control, Kozmo might be the deck for you.

This is the deck for you!,"The full combo for this deck is opening up 2 level 3 monsters and either feather storm or trap trick which gets us our feather storm. Besides that you pretty much play a regular Burning Abyss. This allows us to just simply go second, while virtually FTKing when going first. The lock is very devasating, although counters do exist. One can then easily side out the simorgh/feather storm engine game 2 and 3 if you are playing a match.This lock might even have competitive potential, although the pricetag might scare some people away. In reality many expensive cards can be replaced however."

This is the (possibly dubious) message in Disney's ""Cruella"", about the iconic villain's young years. Emma Stone plays fashion-loving Estella, whose feuds with a legendary designer (Emma Thompson) make her pick out her inner troublemaker. Gone are the cute 101 Dalmatians, the focus is instead on the sharp competition of two determined women. <a>https://architizer.com/firms/release-date/</a>  - They let Craig (Gillespie) and Tony (McNamara) write what they wanted. It was undeniably darker than a regular Disney movie, but not as dark as a child-forbidden movie, says Stone. <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/fastandfurious9denmark/</a>  Who do you prefer among Estella and Cruella, and who was a bigger challenge to play?  Stone: It's interesting, because Estella gets rejected at some point. She is cute but not completely realized. There's something exciting about Cruella, she's who she is. I'm more interested in her world. But she crosses certain boundaries that I would never do but… I prefer Cruella. it's so much fun to play over! <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/centervagt/</a>  She does not think she's the villain.  Stone: I could never play someone who's just mean. No one who is evil thinks they are evil. They think they are right.  What was the craziest outfit you wore, something that made you 100 percent Cruella? <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/smagen-af-sult/</a>  Stone: My absolute favorite was the dress I wore on the garbage truck, because it had a 13 meter long trailer.

This is the (possibly dubious) message in Disney's ""Cruella"", about the iconic villain's young years. Emma Stone plays fashion-loving Estella, whose feuds with a legendary designer (Emma Thompson) make her pick out her inner troublemaker. Gone are the cute 101 Dalmatians, the focus is instead on the sharp competition of two determined women. <a>https://architizer.com/firms/release-date/</a>  - They let Craig (Gillespie) and Tony (McNamara) write what they wanted. It was undeniably darker than a regular Disney movie, but not as dark as a child-forbidden movie, says Stone. <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/fastandfurious9denmark/</a>  Who do you prefer among Estella and Cruella, and who was a bigger challenge to play?  Stone: It's interesting, because Estella gets rejected at some point. She is cute but not completely realized. There's something exciting about Cruella, she's who she is. I'm more interested in her world. But she crosses certain boundaries that I would never do but… I prefer Cruella. it's so much fun to play over! <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/centervagt/</a>  She does not think she's the villain.  Stone: I could never play someone who's just mean. No one who is evil thinks they are evil. They think they are right.  What was the craziest outfit you wore, something that made you 100 percent Cruella? <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/smagen-af-sult/</a>  Stone: My absolute favorite was the dress I wore on the garbage truck, because it had a 13 meter long trailer. It was not part of the dress because I would not have been able to move otherwise. They put it on at the last minute when we were going to film. There was nothing to wear in reality, not even nearby. Then there is an epic dress where I cover the whole car, it was also fantastic. Then you know you're in a movie.  <a>https://steemit.com/denmark/@dk-sv-no-fi/se-filmene-pa-fast-and-furious-9</a>"

Auroradon is prefect for a lair of darkness deck as you will come to see if you play this deck.  You can use a cursed eldland to bate an ash and then follow through with this combo.  With lair of darkness on the field, you can tribute golden lord for either of the viruses to get rid of their spell, traps or monsters with 1500 or less def.  this deck can be blocky at times but it's really fun to play if you draw a decent enough hand.

And then the 2020 banlist happened and pretty much killed the deck with the ban of harp horror, many orcust players hoped that mekk-knight orcust girsu could make the deck good again, but sadly it failed and MR5 wasn't helping. With the new Eldlich deck which was combined with the jet-synchro/halqifibrax/auroradon combo and adamanicipator which could gain huge amounts of advantage with block dragon and make almost unbreakable boards with a buster dragon lock, the age of orcust was over. </span>  <span>Until some crazy dude thought: Wait a sec... Eldlich has a pretty good grind game, wasn't there another good grind deck which was meta and had pretty good cards. And this is probably how Orcust Eldlich was created, sadly this deck toped 2 times (as much as I know) and harp is still banned. So the deck is not a tier 1 contender, but hey the deck looks like a good rogue/tier 2 deck to me.  </span>  <span>So basically the deck uses the orcust engine to get crescendo, which is an omni negate as a counter trap. And they also use it to get dingirsu which protects your backrow from stuff like lightning storm, sends a card on the field to the gy and recycles banished orcust monster. The other engine is eldlich which replaces traps, can summon golden lord as a beatstick with protection and uses golden lord as interuption. The rest is just stuff like solemns, torrential or droplet. </span>  <span>You could also play pot of disparity, but I personally like the non-disparity version more. In the end there is just 1 thing to say: BRING HARP BACK TO 1 KONAMI!!!</span>"

This deck in its own way has gained even more consistency with the new cards that came in the latest Booster Pack, LIGHTNING OVERDRIVE. With the addition of cards like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=When%20A.I.%20First%20Met%20You"">A.I. Meet You</a>"", and the newest Link-1 monster for the archetype, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Infant%20%40Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a>"", which added the more consistency to the Deck.  The main strategy of the Deck is swarming your Cyberse monsters, from your hand, Graveyard, and Extra Deck, which can be easily made with their field Spell ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ignister%20A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I. Land</a>"", that allows you to Special Summon your Ignister monsters from your hand, as long as you control no monsters in your Main Monster Zone, and you can use its effect as many times you can! Since this card is a Once Per-Attribute, which makes you not able to Special Summon a second monster with the same Attribute as another @Ignister you summoned previously with its effect. To Special Summon your @Ignister monsters from your graveyard you can use cards like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=A.I.dle%20Reborn"">A.I.Dle Reborn</a>"", which is a Quick-Play Spell that lets you Summon any of your @Ignisters, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Splash%20Mage"">Splash Mage</a>"" for a single multi reborn, and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Transcode%20Talker"">Transcode Talker</a>"" for your Link Monsters, which can be used for a Link Summon of ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Accesscode%20Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>"" that can bring you the win in many cases.  For more disruptions you can run basic trap cards, such as ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Infinite%20Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Paleozoic%20Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Solemn%20Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"", and in optional, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Compulsory%20Evacuation%20Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a>"".  <strong>Simple Combo: </strong>This combo is a simple one, which all you need is 1 Achichi, and 1 Doyon in your hand.  You first Normal Summon your Achichi, and you search for a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Bururu%20%40Ignister"">Bururu @Ignister</a>.  Next you are going to Link Summon into your Dark Infant, which will let you add an Ignister A.I. Land directly from your Deck.  Activating your A.I. Land you are going to use its effect to Special Summon Bururu, and using Bururu's effect to Send a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Pikari%20%40Ignister"">Pikari @Ignister</a> from your Deck to your Graveyard.  Using your Dark Infant and your Bururu, you go for a Link-2 of Splash Mage.  Following that you use your Ignister A.I. Land to Special Summon your Doyon, and using its effect to add Pikari from your Graveyard to your hand.  Using Splash Mage's effect you can either Summon your Bururu or Achichi, which doesn't matter which you want to Summon.  By Linking your 3 monsters, Doyon, Splash Mage, and your Special Summoned monster into a Link Summon of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Templar%20%40Ignister"">Dark Templar @Ignister</a>.  Ignister A.I. Land to a Special Summon of your Pikari, triggering your Dark Templar, which in this card you are going to declare Pikari's effect before the Dark Templar.  With Dark Templar, you are going to Summon your Bururu, and Doyon, and with Pikari you are going to add A.I.Dle Reborn to your hand.  Next you Synchro Summon using your Bururu and Doyon into <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Wind%20Pegasus%20%40Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a>  triggering Bururu's effect, while allows you to Summon 1 of the Synchro Materials used for the Synchro Summon, bringing back Doyon.  Using Pikari's second effect, you are going to make your Wind Pegasus a Level 4, and using Pikari and Wind Pegasus for an Xyz Summon of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Light%20Dragon%20%40Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> .  And finally, using your Doyon and Dark Templar into your Link-4 <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Topologic%20Bomber%20Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> , and ending by setting your A.I.Dle Reborn.  This combo gives you a monster destruction by using Topologic Bomber's effect and A.I.Dle Reborn to Special Summon any of your @Ignisters, and combining Light Dragon's effect that prevents destruction in order to protect your monsters. And when using Light Dragon's effect that protects your monsters, you must detach Wind Pegasus in order to use its effect in the Graveyard when you are able.  <strong>Final Analysis:</strong>  Deck Strengths <span class=""ILfuVd""><span class=""hgKElc"">&#x1f44d;</span></span>: Searching: 5/5 Swarm: 5/5 Attack: 4.5/5 Versatility: 4/5 Defense: 3/5 OTK: 4/5 Control: 3/5 Comeback: 3/5  Deck Weaknesses <span class=""aCOpRe"">&#x1f44e;</span>: Graveyard Restrictions (Necrovalley, Dimensional Shifter...): 5/5 Special Summon Restrictions (TCBO, Summon Limit...): 4/5 Extra Deck Restrictions (Monarchs, Vanity's Fiend...): 4/5 Hand Traps (Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre...): 4/5 Tribute to your Field monsters (Kaijus, Sphere Mode...) 4/5 Field Destruction (Raigeki, Lightning Storm): 3/5 Spell/Trap Removal (Cosmic Cyclone, Mystic Space Typhoon...): 2/5 Beat Stick monsters (ATK 3000 or higher): 1/5"

The monster you will be using to kill you opponent will be <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because of it's attack boost for each ritual card  in your GY, this also works best when this is two or more of <a data-name=""Phaleg"">Phaleg</a> on the flied as the attack boost stacks and you use a lot of ritual card to summon ritual card. <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> popping effect is also great because you should at least have two different ritual cards in your GY by the time you summon <a data-name=""Bethor"">Bethor</a>. <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is the best way to summon Megalith monsters, since you can target cards in your deck and then ditch cards from your hand putting them into the GY. But since it is also a quick effect if you can activate during your opponents turn to summon something like <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to destroy their card during their turn. The Impcantation cards are there for search and return, <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a> on summon from deck adds Megalith ritual monster, <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> returns Megalith ritual monster from GY, though <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> and <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> you can reveal ritual and summon the other from deck you can use <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> to discard it's self to summon one from deck.

In Disney's punk ""Cruella"" we meet a sympathetic version of the supervillain Cruella de Vil - but the result is unfortunately not completely spotless. <a>https://centervagt.wildapricot.org/10575712</a> Whether it's the adorable cartoon versions or the more realistic variations, the Dalmatians Pongo, Perdita, and their 101 puppies are for most of us a part of our childhood. In the children's films, the cute puppies are nastyly stolen by the unpleasant diva Cruella - a dramatic lady in black and white hair, who can, uh, walk over corpses to get her claws in her long-awaited fur. <a>https://retfaerdighedens-ryttere.wildapricot.org/news/10575834</a>  In the 2021 ""Cruella"", we start again from the beginning and meet a young Estella (Emma Stone), miles from the terrifying Cruella we feel today. Estella has hopes and dreams of becoming a fashion designer, but life takes its toll and in a tragic accident involving her own mother, both fear and disgust for Dalmatian dogs arise. As a troubled teenager, she ends up on the streets among London's shady neighborhoods. <a>https://wptest.candle.com.tw/community/profile/conanfilm2021/</a>  Together with newcomer companions Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Water Hauser), the petty thieves make the streets unsafe - until Estella encounters the biggest boss of them all, the Baroness (Emma Thompson). Estella now has to weigh how much of herself is the everyday and friendly Estella, and how much is now taken up by her more theatrical persona - Cruella. <a>https://oldpelicula2021.wildapricot.org/pelicula/10576619</a>  In the footsteps of the acclaimed ""Joker"" (2019), ""Birds of Prey"" (2020), and the upcoming TV series ""Loki"" (2021), it is thus villain stories that are highly topical on the wallpaper.  <a>https://pakleneulice9.wildapricot.org/</a> Nobody wants to see a hell hero save the cat from the tree, we rather want to see how the torn cat ended up there from the very beginning. ""Cruella"" wants to be challenging and extravagant, but the film comes to itself that it is ultimately part of a family-oriented Disney world.  Cruella is a difficult figure to deal with, you have to give it to them anyway. A lot of other famous villains, for example Cinderella's ""Maleficent"" (2014) gave us a anything but light-hearted background story that made the fairy tales' division into black or white blurred at the edges. But Cruella, how do you instill sympathy in such a hated character - the one who literally made fur coats out of dogs?  The soundtrack to ""Cruella"" is awesome with The Clash, Blondie, and The Doors. There are cool costumes, glamorous balls, and the vicious fashion and clothing-filled scenes of the dynamics of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006). But with a superficial theme, unfortunately, also comes a superficial result, as the desire to get a time-typical depth in Emma Stone's villain is spun away in the eagerness to make the film both dramatic and furiously elegant. <a>https://steemit.com/denmark/@dk-sv-no-fi/synopsis-cruella-og-hvordan-man-ser-online-med-tekst-dansk</a>  ""Cruella"" is definitely a cool film, where both Emma Thompson and Emma Stone make spotless contributions as their respective fashion stars. As the film is supposed to be edgy and a relatively dark story, I strongly miss the humorous touch that Glenn Close added in his role as live-action Cruella in ""101 Dalmatians"" (1996). The rest of the film is too long, too annoying - all the gala events will soon be tiring to watch - and not as innovative as I had imagined. ""Cruella"" does not deserve all the barking, but it would clearly have offered more nostalgia and less superficiality."

Mov has listed the hottest titles coming between June and August. The hottest months of the year are perhaps more associated with sun, swimming and barbecuing than with video games, but that does not stop the industry from releasing a lot of exciting titles between June and August. <a>https://cruellahebrew.splashthat.com/</a>  The game was already catchy looking on Playstation 4, but this summer a new version will be released that has higher image update and generally nicer graphics on Playstation 5. <a>https://conjuring3hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>  The icing on the cake with this release is that a brand new episode follows while waiting for the regular sequel, which is about how the character Yuffie infiltrates the city of Midgar to steal a powerful magic from the evil organization Shinra, in parallel with the plot in the original . <a>https://conjuring3hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>  ""Intergrade"" is simply a good excuse to replay the already fantastic game, or a great opportunity for newcomers to grab it. <a>https://f9hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>  Since the beginning of the 2000s, Insomniac Games has entertained players with its action-packed and colorful adventures with ""Ratchet &amp; Clank"", which now has a really nice sequel that uses the power of Playstation 5. <a>https://spacejamlegacyhebrew.splashthat.com/</a>  This time, the radar pair Ratchet and Clank once again fight the evil robot Dr Nefarious, who has acquired a weapon that can open portals to find an alternative universe where he always wins. Our heroes are separated in different dimensions, where Clank meets the new playable character Rivet.  sc  <a>https://moviezinetv.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/titta-pa-cruella-film-online-fullversion-med-svenska-undertexter/</a>"

The first was DM, I am going with the Goat format banlist in a trad style (banned cards can be played at one). The second I pulled Catapult turtle from MRD I knew what I would play this deck. My only real laments would be my awful IOC luck where I pulled nothing good, I only got one chaos sorc, and none of the big chaos monster (I was really hoping for DMOC). The side deck is to go into P.A.C.M.A.N. if I don't think the scientist thing works out."

So I took the main Ogdoadic engine and paired it with Rokket Dragon Link (now Rokket Dragon Link + King of Feral Imps). Honestly, I'm not sure if I provided an alternative to the deck, or threw a massive monkey wrench in it - I mean, Rokket Dragon Link really isn't my cup of tea. Anyways, if not, I'll try Ogdoadic Nemesis, because that seems proising as well."

Something extra is that some Ignister cards have effects of change of ATK and effect damage, with a combination of specific cards a quite satisfactory OTK of effect damage can be achieved.  <strong>The Combo Pieces</strong>  <strong>Fire Phoenix:</strong> The most important piece, when it attacks it can cancel the battle damage to be able to do effect damage equal to its ATK  <strong>Cyberse Accelerator:</strong> This card is usually not very useful, it is pretty bad above all, but this card can give 2000 ATK to a monster that it targets which is necessary for Fire Phoenix.  <strong>Donyoribo:</strong> It is a quite useless ignister in a normal recipe, this has the effect of banishing the GY to double an effect damage with a Fire Phoenix with 4300 ATK the damage would fall by 8600 for a win.  <strong>Ignister &amp; A.I</strong>  <strong>Achichi:</strong> One of the best Ignister since he can look for another Ignister which is easy to summon thanks to the field.  <strong>Pikari:</strong> Achichi but he looks for Magic / Traps, he is especially good when looking for his Monster Reborn.  <strong>Bururu:</strong> You can send Donyoribo to the GY, it is also searchable with Wicckid.  <strong>Doyon:</strong> He can retrieve the used monster from Normal Summon to summon it again with the field or return a Spell/Trap.  <strong>When A.I. First Met You:</strong> Monster Searcher.  <strong>A.I.dle Reborn:</strong> Revive an Ignister.  <strong>A.I.Land:</strong> The main engine of the Ignister Stuff, really neccesary.  <strong>The Arrival Cyberse:</strong> Boss monster of the Archetype that is totally impeccable, if you go first it is a good option.  <strong>Dark Templar</strong>: Another important piece since it can Spam the Ignisters already used as material, even so sometimes you can go from summon it and going directly with Fire Phoenix.  <strong>Dark Infant:</strong> Search the field.  <strong>Cyberse Stuff</strong>  <strong>Parallel eXceed:</strong> Summon two monsters on the field easily.  <strong>Mathmech Addition:</strong> Another easy monster to summon, it can also increase the ATK of Fire Phoenix if you want.  <strong>Code Generator:</strong> It can be used as material from the hand, you can also send Donyoribo to the GY, also in some cases you can add it instead.  <strong>Cynet Mining:</strong> Search Cyberses.  <strong>Crusadia Avramax:</strong> Another Boss Monster option.  <strong>Transcode Talker:</strong> It can also be used for Code Generator activation, plus it can revive.  <strong>Code Talker Inverted:</strong> Summons Cyberse from the hand, it is also the main monster to summon with Code Generator.  <strong>Splash Mage:</strong> Revive Cyberse a Cyberse.  <strong>Cyberse Wicckid:</strong> Can search for Bururu.  <strong>Linguriboh</strong>: Can negate a opponent trap.  <strong>Other Options</strong>  <strong>@Ignister: </strong>Gatchiri can be easily summoned in addition to protecting, Doshin can also be easily summoned, Earth Golem alongside Doshin and Fusion can work, Wind Pegasus has synergies with Bururu, A.I. Contact you can draw 3 cards to 1 copy is a fine card, FA.I.ghting Spirit I think it can be a pretty good card since it is similar to A.Idle Reborn but I did not have enough time to test it.  <strong>Cyberse Stuff: </strong>Scrypton is easy to summon, Lady Debug is a very good seeker, Mathmech Sigma is another easy monster to summon, Quantum Dragon is sometimes a better Synchro option, Primathmech Alembertian with more Mathmech may be ideal.  <strong>Going Second: </strong>The deck likes to go second for its OTK so some cards to go second can serve as Pankratops to easily destroy, Dark Ruler No More in any case (Although it removes damage), Forbidden Droplet to negate several cards.  <strong>Thing you should know</strong>  Easy Play: Summon Fire Phoenix quickly, use it as material for Accelerator and revive Fire Phoenix where it aims. It's an easy play to make that goes straight to the point.  With the above, A.I.dle Reborn can revive the big monsters like Fire Phoenix which makes this combo much easier.  Cyberse Accelerator is the one that has to aim towards Fire Phoenix, unless you can revive Fire Phoenix first Cyberse Accelerator is the first summon.  Dark Infant should not always be summoned first, it has an effect to move and allows 3 monsters to be summoned with Dark Templar.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> I think it will work out fine.  <strong>Monarch:</strong> Based on an old recipe I used, I updated it to be Banlist compliant.  <strong>Ogdoabyss:</strong> They're still there 0.0 .  <strong>Remakes:</strong> Best Fusion Deck: I honestly don't know what to do with him, Abyss Actor: Will be ready for August 3, Infernity Xyz: I've been having a lot of fun with him even though is soooooo bricky.  If you would like to see one of this deck, don't forget to comment, it cheers me up."

If you are not a budget player, you can change a lot of things (Like adding at least 2 Shuraigs and 2 other Fraktalls which I just can't find anyone selling around here), however, after playing Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade, I liked this deck so much that I tried to run other things on it. I'm uploading the current version of the deck which I have right now because I may change it with LIOV coming soon.  I don't like the barrier lock (this shouldn't be the win-condition of a Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade deck), even though it's here in the main deck, I usually side it out for something more useful or maybe the thunderbird since the deck doesn't need the normal summon that much.  The win-con is Tri-brigade oath in the GY with Apollousa + Simorgh + Apex Avian + Double Dragon Lords + Naturia Beast. Tri-Brigade Oath is one of the best cards in this deck because the main weakness is Dark Ruler No More which shuts down the board avoiding my monster negations. The way I've seen people keeping Oath live is usually by having Kerass as the beast monster on the field. He doesn't do anything in the opponent's turn, that's why I try I want Naturia beast.  I'll try to explain some of my choices. Feel free to disagree. Yes, 44 cards. I just refuse to remove any of the cards in the main deck (except barrier statue which I'll as soon as I get another Fraktall). I run a couple garnets which I don't wanna draw as often (when I do draw them, Ferrijit saves my day), and Reborn Tengu thins the deck.  -Harpie's feather storm is the best card in the deck. There's almost no scenario where I don't have a wind-winged-beast monster. And sometimes I keep Harpie conductor on the field to activate it from the hand. -Gamma is the best hand-trap for this deck since Fraktall, Rescue cat, One for One and Foolish burial are cards that must resolve, and are usually easy targets for Ash. -Reborn Tengu is good since he fills up the GY and keeps a body on the field -Fraktall is at one copy because I just can't find it. But since he's searchable through Nervall, I can always have him when I need. -Valerifawn and Mine mole are my targets for Rescue Cat when I want Naturia Beast, but when I've already used Cat, I can Ferret them plus any level 1 since I save Ferrijit special summon for them. Then I activate him under Simorgh or Apollousa. Valerifawn is the best beast level 2 earth tuner I could find, since I can use him to get back Kitt or Kerass, and Mine Mole helps me keeping card advantage while comboing off. -Ayers Rock Sunrise is a card I really like and I was trying to run more copies of it, however, I had to shave them since the deck is already 40+ cards. This card can be used as a specific monster reborn for Rescue Cat when the opponent activates infinite impermanence or veiler, since I can link it off for Almiraj and then bring it back to use its effects. I can do the same for Ferret, I can also bring Ferrijit or Naturia Beast back with it after linking them off. Sometimes the ATK decreasing comes in clutch. -Pot of Acquisitiveness is really helpful to recycle the monsters I banish and it doesn't minuses me. -Cattle Call helps me cheat out Link 3 monsters and get at least into a two-material Apollousa if I use it on Reborn Tengu to play around Nibiru. I'm not sure about more than one copy of it. -Number 64 is another target for the materials I get with Rescue cat since the token deals with problems that must be dealt with by battle, or it can be beast in the GY since I can link it and its token off for Ferrijit. -Daruma Doll helps me recycle some of the banished cards when I'm in a simplified game state and his backroll destruction sometimes comes in clutch as well. -Brigrand is in the side deck for matches against Dogmatika. The rest of the side is to deal with Winda and backroll decks."

I feel that at this stage of the meta most decks have stopped running answers to Maximus in the extra deck, so utilizing it properly can be an absolute hose vs some decks.  Super poly is backbreaking for breaking boards. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon being the target vs Dragon link and Dragoon decks, Raidjin vs Simorgh if it comes up, Augoeides for the mirror, and Shekhinaga vs the decks that spam earth - zoodiac especially  Lyna lets you extend shaddoll lines where you have 1 shaddoll and magistus to give you a useful link to link off your ariel and construct for, both lets construct add schism, de-clogs your board and searches ecclesia for if needed  Hand traps of choice are Droll &amp; Lock  - it's endss turns vs ther best decks - and ash blossom - always applicable. Called by the grave protects your own plays, and a single Fleurdelis give negation power from hand traps, and can be hard to play around even if you know they are there.  Only 2 prosperity as i find it Bricky in multiples as you really cannot afford to spend 9+ extra deck monsters, but finding the card selection is still very good.  Sideboard is very generic, nothing special or techy in it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Here the link to the banlist I used for this:  https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/March_2008_Lists_(WC08-VG)  It's meant to be pre Synchro. It will probaply  go only against Dark Armed Dragon Destiny HERO.  In a lot of decklists I looked at for inspiration from the Side ""Road of the King"" the players didn't play ""Magical Merchant"".  Is there a special reason behind this?  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day everyone!"

Bewitch your opponent's deck! UwU La magia de la sincronía será desatada! Hechiza el deck de tu oponente!

OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/vvip9anOD_4  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army: </strong>Nos da cualquier guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Envía a Cloak o Boots para traer a este último o a Brigandine respectivamente.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El Deck usa mill, por lo que puede ser vulnerable a Efectos Rápidos que se activan en Cementerio.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

On this deck profile, i will only be explaning my changes from the previous build.  https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-castle-gren-maju-revised/  &nbsp;  <span>Deck Changes</span>  The current build i'm experimenting with takes into account the additions to other decks and my thoughts on how best to deal with them, as well as having the potential July banlist and beyond in mind.  <span>Main deck</span>  -1 Eater Of Millions  -2 Nibiru  +1 Lancea  +2 Lightning Storm  With Drytrons likely to come back into the fold, and their ability to search Lancea in mind, i had to think of a way to reduce the chances of being stuck with a hand too banish reliant, while also retaining the decks function. The second Eater Of Millions was the easiest thing to cut as both Gizmek and Pot Of Desires are simply too neccessary to consider cutting. In it's placed I added a copy of Lancea. Outside of Dimension Shifter, my only real answers to a full Dinosaur board were Raigeki (providing Dolka was summoned and not Laggia) and super poly to take Ultinate Conductor Tyranno and Secure Garda off the field. Only 1 copy of Lancea is used, as Shifter is the primary hand trap i want to draw. I can draw Lancea after using Shifter no problem, I'll still likely get one more turn to go for the OTK, but I cannot use Shifter after Lancea as Shifter requires an empty grave.  Dinosaurs becoming more prevelant (especially with Scrap Raptor) meant that Nibiru being at 3 was also a bad idea in the main deck. As mentioned Shifter is my main go to hand trap because of it's sheer power vs the meta, and is just as brutally effective against Dino's as Lancea. After much thought i decided to swap out 2 of them for 2 Lightning Storm. This allows me to deal with more effectively with trap heavy Zoodiac Tri-Brigade, backrow and links such as Apolussa, Simorgh e.t.c.  Super Poly is still there to deal with things like Invoked/Dragoon/Dragon Link but is surprisingly effective against both Tri-Brigade builds and the updated Drytron;  Drytrons: Ultimateness/ Beatrice+ Megalith/Drytron Link= Mudragon  Tri-Brigade: 3 links = Almarduke. Easily done, especially as you can often bait your opponent into summoning the third link if needed by using Harpie's/Lightning Storm to force the opponent to chain Revolt. The opponent will likely do so as they can add a second Revolt to hand when Bearbrumm goes back to the graveyard. Handily gets around Barrier Statue too.  Extra Deck  No changes. Pain Gainer for a 4 material Zeus and something else may replace the 2 N'tiss if Dogmatika continues to drop in play. The extra deck is plenty flexible enough to keep them for now.  Side Deck  Droll is added over Phantazmay simply because it is stronger against more meta decks, especially now Drytron is back in the mix. I believe that Dragon Link will be hit on the banlist in some capacity also. Whilst still good against Tri-Brigade, I already have significant enough coverage against it that keeping handtraps specific to certain match ups such as Phantazmay, when a more blanket handtrap exists isn't going to be as effective going forward. Droll can also interchange with Ash in the main deck depending on how the post banlist format takes shape too.  A second copy of Nibiru and Lancea are in the main deck, that can be added depending on the matchup. 3 Twin Twisters purely because it's chainable to Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order but also offers extra backrow removal.  Feel free to like and comment your thoughts!  &nbsp;"

It will only perform competitively in the most casual of settings.  <strong>UPDATE 10/25/21: </strong>Embarrassing as they may be, these two early Blue-Eyes White Dragon decks were my re-entry point to playing YuGiOh after nearly 18 years since I last played. In the time since I built this initial deck from a single copy of the Saga of the BEWD structure deck, I've learned the basic theory and game mechanics of YuGiOh and run an incomparably better deck. This is a good reminder that less than six months ago, I didn't know a damn thing about this game."

Being the first pirate archetype (RIP Skyfang brigade) it has quite a unique look and gimmick. I find it to be a good deck for new players who want to learn about the mechanics even tho it can be hard to master.  So here is a decklist I presented on my Youtube channel.  It's mostly a pure version. The ratio may be a bit odd, but they were fine for me, giving me the most enjoyment while playing.  As for the strategy itself, take a look to the video in which I go on about the main combo of the deck (<strong>English subtitles are available</strong>)  "

I’m actually super happy about this new support because I did ask for it before, now that it’s here I’m extremely happy to present to you, deciphering the ciphers (pun COMPLETELY intended)! So I had an overview of the new cards, the new biplane is worth playing triplane of. Double exposure became a 3 of because it wasn’t searchable and did have some neat effects. The cipher interference was actually put at one, the only thing it does is push for game and it’s searchable. For the ciphers that already exist all main deck monsters are at 3 except entangler who’s at one. I put 3 rank up and the traps are mostly useless but one double cipher can be played, if you don’t want to play double cipher you can definitely replace it with upstart goblin. For the extra deck I have 2 X dragon because it self overlays, one Neo cipher because it’s a solid boss to do a very hard push for game, 2 cipher blade dragon for the free rank up, and 3 of the original cipher dragon because that’s what powers up and makes plays for the deck.  For the techs you’ll probably understand most of them but I’ll explain anyways:  Storm cipher has the namesake of the cipher and is searchable via cynet mining, its only there for those reasons  Number 97, 38, and 100 are the dragobulon engine, it’s an otk engine that’s really good because of the sheer amounts of ranks you make in this build.  I also added a utopia engine (with photon) using utopia double, double or nothing, the new version of number 99, photon thrasher, and number 90. Using double to summon number 99 and then summon number 90 with number 99’s effect. Next turn 90 attaches a thrasher from your deck to itself for another negate.

""Hail to the Deadites"", a documentary that pays homage to the film series and the culture around it, will be released this summer. <a>https://cruellaukraine.wildapricot.org/</a>  The documentary, produced and directed by Steve Villeneuve, is based on several interviews with people who have been involved in the films. Participating are not least the main character Bruce Campbell, but also names like Betsy Baker, Theresa Tilly, Ellen Sandweiss and Ted Raimi. <a>https://conjuring3filmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  At the same time, we get to go to big conventions, where we get to meet a number of dedicated ""Evil Dead"" fans, who talk about their passion for the films . <a>https://conjuring3ukraine.wildapricot.org/</a> In October, it has been 40 years since ""Evil Dead"" first hit theaters, and its popularity and endless cult status have so far resulted in four movies, the TV series ""Ash vs Evil Dead"", comic books and more. By putting a lot of its focus on the fans, ""Hail to the Deadites"" explains why the film series has actually become as beloved as it is.  Check out the trailer for the documentary below: <a>https://aquietplaceukraine.wildapricot.org/</a>  ""Hail to the Deadites"" premiered (and was praised) at the Canadian Fantasia Film Festival in August last year, and is now getting a digital release on July 27. Whether it also appears in Swedish services or vod supply is not confirmed. <a>https://skazhenevesillya3.wildapricot.org/</a>"

It’s a combo control deck that focuses on out grinding your opponent. Earth Machine is super fun an,"<ol>  	<li><span> Earth Machine is the 2nd best deck after pendulum. It’s a combo control deck that focuses on out grinding your opponent. It also doesn’t typically use negates as interruption, instead relying on traps and destruction. The main goal in any duel going 1st is to get your engine flowing, survive your opponent’s turn, and then proceed to pop off now you have all your best cards in your GY and hand. The best build of the deck is no longer budget due to <b>Machina Metalcruncher </b>rising to 14$, but I will leave a budget list below. </span></li> </ol> <span><b>Strengths</b>: <b>Infinitracks</b> let you modulate your levels to access a large variety of ranks you usually wouldn’t be able to, meaning you can hard summon <b>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder! </b> </span>  <span>The Engine is not too large, allowing to you to main deck about 6-12 going 2nd cards.  </span>  <span><b>Forbidden Droplet</b> is incredible here because it can function both as a trap and a board breaker. Since your turn one board isn’t extraordinarily strong, you can use droplet as additional interruption. The basic 1 card combo alone creates 2 monsters on field that don’t do much that you can send, and since you only need 1 card to combo, you can afford to send a lot of your hand as well. </span>  <span>You are not completely reliant on your extra deck. Even if you are locked out of it, you still have <b>Machina Fortress</b> and <b>Machina Citadel</b>. </span>  <span>The deck plays well under skill drain due to high attack monsters and easy summoning conditions. </span>  <span>This deck also has a searchable El Shaddoll Winda out in the form of <b>Machina Fortress</b>. </span>  <span><b>Weaknesses</b>: This deck is extremely GY reliant, so any cards like <b>Dimension Shifter</b> and <b>Macro Cosmos </b>are<b> </b>very detrimental. </span>  <span>Combos lose hard to most hand traps. <b>Droll and Lock Bird</b>, <b>Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</b>, <b>Nibiru, the Primal Being</b>, and Gamma are some of the worst. </span>  <span>If your normal summon is removed from the field, you will not be able to use any <b>Infinitracks</b> in your hand. </span>  <span>You do not play many extenders so playing through multiple interruptions can be tough. </span>  <span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}""> </span>  <span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}""> </span>  <span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}""> </span>  <span><b>1 card main combo</b> </span>  <span><b>This combo needs either Machina Metalcruncher, <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a>, Machina Redeployment, or Heavy Forward</b> </span>  <span><b>All these cards are played at three, so you have 12 cards combo starters. </b> </span>  <span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}""> </span>  <b><span data-contrast=""auto""> <span><span>1.)</span> </span></span></b><span>I will use <b>Machina Metalcruncher</b> as my starter.

Or pendulum summon them with the Dragoons of Draconia cards, which also give your normal monsters battle effects! Since rituals and normal monsters have great synergy, I fit in a small ritual engine with Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms to search Knight of Armor Dragon, Sonic Bird to search the ritual art cards, and Nowruz Elise/Armed Dragon Lv5 as special summoning targets.  The 1 Tribute WIND monsters were mainly chosen for their high attack values, but each one has some utility as well.  The one non-WIND tribute monster, Knight of the Red Lotus, is also able to cheat itself out like DAD but for normal monsters.  I don't know why I made this crappy deck!"

Worth looking at if only for the funsies!,"Truly awful with just what they had in Blazing Vortex, Lightning Overdrive brought a lot of much needed support for this archetype.  S/T removal with Mammud and Big Blow and effect negates with Dignity.  Still a very battle focused archetype it can at least stand a bit of a chance against other decks now.  Opening hand should have you opening with Mountain (or Terraforming at the least), and one or two monsters.  The deck certainly has enough searchers in it now to have a consistent opening rip.  Mammud and Orpis can normal themselves with no tribute and Gactos can special himself if you normaled that turn.  Fortia, Wento, and Gactos can search if your opponent sends them by card effect; Fortia to hand, Wendo and Gactos special summon.  Two Extravagance for slightly more consistence and Cross Over to help remove monsters.  Big Blow is essentially an archetype Heavy Storm Duster when your opponent makes a War Rock leave the field: basically everything except for battle destruction as it can only be activated in the Main Phase).  I use Spirit as a Battle Phase Monster Reborn but I am sure other people smarter than me could make better use for it.  Extra deck is all Link Monsters for various toolbox needs you might have but I think putting some XYZ Monsters in wouldn't be a bad idea.  I just am not sure which.  Side deck isn't anything special, Monster Reborn, Expendable Dai, and Mind Crush I'm all a little iffy on.  Alternates I would put in are a third Solemn Judgment and Infinite Impermanence.

Keeper of the Shrine can be tributed to normal summon out Diabolos or Dark Horus from the hand.  Ahrima and Lilith tribute themselves and bring out Diabolos from the hand or GY.  By using Lilith's effect to choose the 2 viruses (or InfImp) we want and trap trick, we can always get the virus we need while only main decking 2 copies of each, saving deck space. Virus cards give info, rip cards from the opponent's hand, and can tribute our opponent's monsters while we have Lair of Darkness active.  Lair of Darkness also allows the deck to reliably use Super Polymerization to fuse away 2 or 3 of the opponent's monsters into Predaplant Triphyoverutum or Starving Venom Fusion Dragon at spell speed 4.  I would love to hear any suggestions to improve the deck!"

Here we meet Usnavi (played by Anthony Ramos) who leads the audience through his sun-drenched neighborhood of Washington Heights, where song, dance and flirty glances are found around every corner. <a>https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/27110-unnamed-draft</a>  ""In the Heights"" is the Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda (""Hamilton"", you know) which is now being directed by Jon M. Chu (""Crazy Rich Asians""). Other roles include Melissa Barrera, Corey Hawkins and Jimmy Smits. <a>https://cruellaizle.wildapricot.org/</a>  ""Space Jam"" from 1996 will soon have a sequel, and here comes a new sneak peek - in the form of a sports documentary.  The clip below is intended as a prelude to this summer's clash between basketball professional LeBron James and the threatening Good Squad. To help him, LeBron has his animated team with Bugs Bunny, <a>https://fastandfurious9ukraine.wildapricot.org </a>Daffy Dock and Lola Bunny (Zendaya) in the lead, but the question is whether that is enough? A lot is at stake when an evil AI (Don Cheadle) has kidnapped his son ...  Check out the clip below.  <a>https://cruealladeutsch.wordpress.com/</a>  Good news awaits those who have grown tired of the longing for ""Evil Dead Rise"", the next chapter in the cult franchise.

Dangers! can out themselves.  Also both are targets for allure and Trade-In. Solemn and Ash for defense.  Perfect opening board is 2 beasts with fallen paradise and Awakening of the Sacred Beasts to create a skill drain effect. Main extra deck cards are Armityle and Almiraj.  Almiraj is to get Beckoning Beast in the GY so it can be a target when you use Spirit Gate to pitch Dark Summoning beast.
