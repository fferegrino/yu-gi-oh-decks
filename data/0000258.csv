The goal is the get a Gryphon Rider and a Balerdroch on the field with Zombie World and Solemns ideally, but the different engines are perfectly capable of holding the games where you see one half of the deck. I like the idea of playing a maindeck focused Brave deck that doesn't lost to Scythe.  Let's go over the cards.  So I have a 10 card Brave package, pretty standard adventurer stuff, 3 Blue Girl, 3 Rite, 1 Gryphon Rider, 1 Adventure, 1 Dracoback. The last card is Foolish Burial, which is nutty in this card, but starts as a Rota for the Brave engine (while also finding Zombie World and Balerdroch when needed). I'd like more access to this engine, but near as I can tell Konami was wily with this engine, and realistically that's probably a good thing given how pushed it is in this form.  We can't activate the effects on the field of any monster we normal summon the turn we brave - we get around this by using graveyard effects, and by activating Banshee on the field on the opponent's turn when needed. You also have to sequence your plays right, since using Bloom locks you out of summoning Gryphon Rider as well. With that in mind, it is still pretty easy to put up a decent number of high quality interruptions very quickly with this engine. Because we are desperate for Zombie World, we're running 3 Banshee, 3 Zombie World, and Terraforming plus Foolish listed above. For Balerdroch we run 2 - you see it just enough in those numbers, and you'd rather end on Suck out of Bloom rather than just Balerdroch. You could replace 1 for 1 with the third Balerdroch if you're worried about grindier matchups with grave hate.  Next, I've got Pots. Weird mix, I know, but here's how I came to it. Initially I was running 3 Extra, but it didn't feel like enough ""go"" for me. I really wanted that raw card advantage, so I was on 3 Extra, but I decided to try 1 Prosperity in this mix. This immediately felt better in a lot of ways - the Brave engine gives you ways to pitch excess pots, and while Prosperity is usually weaker in this deck, I came to realize having 1 in the mix did up the consistency of the deck nicely. However, I was having some trouble in games where I saw multiple pots, since my Extra Deck got very thin very fast. I usually don't like Desires much, but in this deck you very often pull the whole engine out of the deck t1 before you ever even fire off Desires, and at 1 Desires if you play it smart it will almost never screw you. Again, raw cards are big here, and being able to actually pull those raw cards is important. However, I left the split, since Prosperity was fulfilling its niche quite nicely, and helps to mitigate from banishing all the Sucks or Link 1s or Barricadeborgs.  Interruption. Called is obligatory - ostensibly for hand traps, and useful there, but also just completely busted as an interruption. 3 Imperm is also kind of obligatory, and Imperm is basically the only Hand Trap I run these days. I think Solemns are also important here - Judgment helps stop sweepers from blowing out your field full of spells and traps, in addition to being a very powerful card and a decent chain ender in its own right. Strike is the ideal chain ender, this is the Countertrap that is good even going second, and having so many negates that pop is tight. 2 Ice Dragons Prison are insane here - they trigger Suck, and thanks to Zombie World also almost always have targets, and the card is already just an insane swing in a lot of common matchups before that. But I like the 1 Trap Trick in the mix over the 3rd, basically represents the threat of a third Prison, but also lets me stack an Imperm in the relevant column on the turn you set your backrow.  Accesscode is bad here, and still really good. But tbh you shouldn't have trouble grinding games out with this engine... assuming you can protect your threats that is.  Still tuning the deck. I'm up to 2 Adventure, and on just 3 of each Zombie World card with no One-For-One or Terraforming, just on most of my 2 card combos, trying to max my chances of the 3 card full combo payoff. One-For-One was hit or miss, but I feel like just running the third Bloom is usually better, and Terraforming was mostly a card I pitched for Adventure. With 2 Adventure you have slightly more, albeit slow, access to your engine while being able to stack your GY with Zombies, so it pulls dual roles, and you can even pitch a redundant copy to the first copy to recycle it with Barricadeborg. I still like 2 Barricadeborg even with a back-up Adventure, and protecting Adventure is still clutch, but the engine seems harder to disrupt this way, and the cost of running Adventure is low, in general, and especially in this deck. I'd love a 2nd Dracoback, since I've taken occasionally to using the token to make Slayer in order to get access to Balerdroch before making a 2nd token and then summoning Gryphon Rider, but this also now kills a lot of the grind game, since there's only 1 Dracoback, and Barricadeborg doesn't recover it. Still, I couldn't justify a 2nd Dracoback, the card is sometimes fine to see but is also kind of the main brick in the deck."

When Exosister came out in the TCG, the deck was streamlined into being just a <a data-name=""N&lt;a data-name=&quot;umber 39: Utopia Double&quot;&gt;umber 39: Utopia Double&lt;/a&gt;"">N</a><a data-name=""umber 39: Utopia Double"">umber 39: Utopia Double</a> enabler. Exosister is inherently flawed by the need for multiple generic extenders to get going, The Shaddoll Dogmatika engines work at a very strong way to lock your opponents out of the game, boosting the control power in a way that allows Exosister to crack back.  This list is very capable of making a turn 1 <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> while also setting up Shaddoll and Dogmatika fusions in the graveyard with <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. This in turn allows us to add and set <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and to add <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted</a> to our hand. Pair this with a potentially searched <a data-name=""Exosister Vadis"">Exosister Vadis</a> from our <a data-name=""Exosister Mikailis"">Exosister Mikailis</a>, and we have 4 interuptions on top of locking out opponent out of special summoning more than once a turn with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. And if our opponent still can play (aka they drew forbidden droplet), we can also potentially go into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> on our following turn. Like most turn 1 decks, we focus on not letting our opponent play.  Due to our ability to activate <a data-name=""Exosister Vadis"">Exosister Vadis</a> on our turn, our ability to special summon multiple Dogmatika monsters (including Fleurdelis which permanently buffs all Dogmatika monsters when they attack), our link package, and our ability to lock our opponent from playing the game, our ability to OTK and attack relentlessly into our opponent is very strong.  Starters: Unlike alot of decks, there arent single cards that get us going. <a data-name=""Exosister Stella"">Exosister Stella</a> and <a data-name=""Exosister Elis"">Exosister Elis</a> can special exosisters from hand, or themself from hand respectively, but the deck really relies on what you draw for extenders. With that being said, <a data-name=""Exosister Pax"">Exosister Pax</a> could be considered a starter for its ability to pick a perfect Exosister to grab for your starting board, along with being an extender if you have a playable start already.  Extenders: For our main extenders, we rely on <a data-name=""Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness"">Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness</a>, a non once per turn summons as long as we control a spellcaster. Which means, they can almost always be playable on our board. We also rely on <a data-name=""Parallel Exceed"">Parallel Exceed</a> as a extender due to its ability to strengthen our access to 2 xyz monsters, as well as an overall consistency boost until we get the new support.  Dogmatika Engine: The Dogmatika engine that i chose to run was 2x <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted</a>, 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>,  and 1x <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>. This package ensures that can get Dogmatika Maximus on the board to send our <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>to get a search for our <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, and a summon of Ecclesia for Fleurdelis, or just to add Fleurdelis herself. <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> also has an ability to act as an extender.  Shaddoll Engine: Our Shaddoll engines consists of 1x <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>, 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, and 1x <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>."

You want to pay life points, and you don't want your opponent to touch you at all. Your starters for this deck are weird. You have <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Theriza"">Dinomorphia Theriza</a>, who grabs any Dinomorphia trap from deck, mainly <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Domain"">Dinomorphia Domain</a>. However you can also grab <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Brute"">Dinomorphia Brute</a> as a great secondary option if you already have domain. Another card that is solid for this is <a data-name=""Lord of the Heavenly Prison"">Lord of the Heavenly Prison</a>, with any other <a data-name=""trap"">trap </a>card he can safely grab your domain from deck. He is also extremely handy for keeping all of your other traps safe, especially the ones you want to keep like <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain.</a>  Also it is important to note, that opening Skill Drain is just the best card, since most decks heavily rely on their smaller cards to do alot of movement to get into the bigger cards, Your most easily accessed cards are either 3000, or the main fusion you will be using Dinomorphia Kentregina with a whopping 4000 atk, not many things are gonna climb over her. She also floats which is amazing.  Your main Deck Dinomorphia monsters float into each other by banishing a trap which is still amazing, because you can utilize them to keep you alive. A simple strategy is to always banish your ""Card effect Protection"" traps if you do not have generic random traps in grave to use as cost for them.  Your best Named Traps in the deck are <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Brute"">Dinomorphia Brute</a>, <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Domain"">Dinomorphia Domain</a>, and <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">Dinomorphia Reversion. </a>  <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">Reversion is an amazing card as it can copy any Counter trap, i.e. Solemn Judgement and you essentially have to Summon Negates, and that is Super strong against most decks. Domain is a solid fusion from deck that, in this deck, has no real cost, and no restriction. Brute is your solid 1 for 1 removal that lets your dinos float</a>  Here is a  basic reaction example for when you have a simple game state and not the ""Best"" hand. You have a Set Brute, a <a data-name=""Dinomorphia Diplos"">Dinomorphia Diplos</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">, and a Theriza in GY. Your opponent Normal Summons </a><a data-name=""Prank-Kids Fansies"">Prank-Kids Fansies</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">. You can get rid of their first summon by using Brute to pop both diplos and fansies. Use the diplos in GY, banish the Brute, summon the theriza, use her effect, and grab a domain from deck. This does not include the other 3 possible cards you had in a starting hand. Lord of the Heavenly Prison + Solemn Judgement = can grab you any important trap, mostly domain from deck and if you already have domain, easily just grab any random solemn or </a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Alert"">Dinomorphia Alert</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion""> for Follow up plays. Alert can help you recover your dead fusions or back both of your level 4's you used for fusions, and then you can XYZ into and Evolz monster and now you either have a negate or if you decide to attack, make </a><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS Sky Thunder</a><a data-name=""Dinomorphia Reversion"">.</a>  Remember in this deck, its High Risk and High Reward. Imagine beating your opponent with 32 Lifepoints left. That's a funny feeling. Have fun paying for others pain.

Extras like Skill Drain (most ideal simply because it's a one-time LP cost to shut down effects entirely) and Gozen Match, which is an ace-in-the-hole against decks that rely on many different attributes to be effective, can fill the gaps. Finally, finish up with Eldlich the Golden Lord or any of the XYZ summons, namely Gustav Max and Juggernaut Liebe, which can be a pretty crazy OTK combo given the right circumstances.  &nbsp;  I've had a solid experience running a similar deck on Master Duel, and so far it has translated well to TCG play."

Targets you can add for Dogmatika Punishment in the extra deck include Elder Entity N'tss, Wind Pegasus @Ignister &amp; Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine. You can special summon Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine from the grave using Cyber Dragon Nova. Use Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine's effect to deal burn DMG if his effect comes up.

I figured I needed to take a break from everything that is Yu-Gi-Oh considering both the meta game of the TCG and MD, and how absurd the secondary market is right now after doing some market watch, but I digress, I'm here now and I'm back with a fairly budget deck, Star Warriors/Combat Stars/Level 5 Warrior toolbox (??? I honestly don't know what to call this one lol.) As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider as either upgrades or substitutes but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span>So, why this deck? I've always been interested in making N/R rarity only decks in MD, and this just so happened to fit the bill, with the exception of a few tech choices but, it's whatever. Also, I've always wanted to make this archetype work.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck, and their respective alternative options, if any:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Tenma the Sky Star"">Tenma the Sky Star</a>, <a data-name=""Hayate the Earth Star"">Hayate the Earth Star</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Kaiki the Unity Star"">Kaiki the Unity Star</a></strong> - <span>These are your main stars (heh) of the deck. Hayate + Kaiki is pretty much a guaranteed <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>, and those two with Tenma and <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> is a guaranteed <a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a>. Mandatory, no alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a></strong> - <span>Your standard Assault Mode package. Brings out any level 6-9 generic Synchro with the greatest of ease. The only close alternative I can recommend is pivoting into the Arcana Knights by adding x3 <a data-name=""King's Knight"">King's Knight</a>, x2-3 <a data-name=""Arcana Knight Joker"">Arcana Knight Joker</a>, x1-2 <a data-name=""Arcana Extra Joker"">Arcana Extra Joker</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Queen's Knight"">Queen's Knight</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Joker's Knight"">Joker's Knight</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Jack's Knight"">Jack's Knight</a></strong> - <span>This is just a free Level 5 LIGHT Warrior 2000 ATK body on board each turn (which sometimes becomes relevant with <a data-name=""Overlay Booster"">Overlay Booster</a> in which we play 2 of).</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>Your main win condition is a Fusion Monster so, you know...</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Feast of the Wild LV5"">Feast of the Wild LV5</a></strong> - <span>Your main win condition requires Level 5 or higher Warrior monsters so, you know... It's just a worse <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>, but a <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> nonetheless.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong> - <span>Could be anything, really. <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>/<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>/<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> as consistency/recovery pieces, <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> or <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> for the Arcana Knights, etc.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Shura the Combat Star"">Shura the Combat Star</a></strong> - <span>Your main win conditions. Idaten the Conqueror Star makes it easy for you to climb into Shura, so you don't really need 3 of him. This is also strange because Shura the Combat Star is ""supposed to be"" an upgrade from Idaten but somehow he feels weaker in testing? So, if you wanna make room for a <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> if you also wanna play <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a>, one less copy of Shura the Combat Star won't hurt.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Understandable. Flex spot, but I'd argue mandatory due to Dogmatika's existence.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a></strong> - <span>Just a good generic Level 8 Synchro. Also a flex spot.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Colossal Fighter"">Colossal Fighter</a></strong> - <span>Neat thematic boss monster, keeps on coming back when destroyed by battle. Mandatory if you want to play <a data-name=""Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode"">Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode</a>, which we don't really have an excuse not to since our deck is focused on Warrior-type monsters anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a></strong> - <span>We play some Xyz monsters. Could also be a flex spot, definitely not mandatory.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Tiras, Keeper of Genesis"">Tiras, Keeper of Genesis</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a></strong> - <span>Generic Rank 5 Xyz monsters. The only alternative for either or both of them is <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> and <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>These two should always go together. Not mandatory, but if you have them, there's no reason not to use both. Gets over a lot of Towers monsters like <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>, and is a non-targeting, non-destruction removal upon getting rid of.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow"">Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow</a>, <a data-name=""LANphorhynchus"">LANphorhynchus</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> - <span>The latter's just removal coverage, LANphorhynchus is just a ladder to Avramax, and the former is just a generic Link 3 and a flex spot.</span></span>  <span><strong>Testing and Closing Thoughts</strong></span>  <span>It's... okay. It's not competitive by any means but, it does what it wants to do, at least. If rogue tier is consisted of decks whose viability to be pushed past rogue depends on its pilot, this is a deck whose viability to be pushed into rogue status depends on its pilot. It's not the fastest deck there is, but if you just want a cheap beat down deck for Master Duel then hey, you know. Just slap a bunch of generic staples that you currently have access to in this deck and you'll probably be just fine, I think. Overall, all I really wanted is to make this deck work, and I think I can be satisfied with this. Surely this could still be improved upon, but it's not that I'm gonna stop testing. Also, who doesn't like taking breaks from playing meta time to time? If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Magical Musketeers are an off-meta deck, being able to disrupt almost anything your opponent throws at you given the right hand and draws. The Magical Musketeers all have 2 shared effects: 1. You can activate ""Magical Musket"" Spell/Traps directly from your hand on your opponent's turn. Being able to wretch out a counter trap or monster negate from your hand is PRETTY GOOD if you ask me. And number 2. All the Main Deck monsters have effects when a spell/trap is activated in their columns, which means they kinda play like Mekk-Knights, which is pretty cool.  We know how I do this. I explain the monsters, then the Spell/Traps, then the Extra deck monsters.  Anyways, the monsters. We're running the popular combination of handtraps: Ash Blossom and Maxx ""C"". I really shouldn't have to explain these cards, they explain themselves in their text and gameplay. Super powerful and can single-handedly turn a bad opener into a devastating hand. And then there's Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. You will only use this is a stupid combo with Cherubini and Union Carrier.  Now, the Magical Musketeers. We have 3 Capsar, 3 Doc, 3 Starfire, 2 Kidbrave, and 1 Calamity. Caspar is possibly the strongest main deck Musketeer. When a spell/trap is activated in this lad's column, you get to search a ""Magical Musket"" card from your deck given its a name that wasn't activated in the chain and resolve. He can search either a monster, spell, or trap, so his utility is amazing. Doc adds a Magical Musket card from your GY to your hand when a spell/trap is used in his column. He's the Caspar of the GY, which has its uses, being able to recycle powerful spell/traps or the link monster I'll explain later. Starfire special summons a Magical Musketeer from the deck given its Level 4 or lower. Which is fair, because being able to special Mastermind, a Level 8 with a powerful end of turn effect to draw cards equal to the number of Magical Musket spell/traps you activated that turn. Kidbrave allows you to discard 1 card to draw 2 cards. Baby Graceful Charity is still decent, but not as good as selecting cards you want to add to your hand, so that's why we run him at 2. Calamity reborns a Magical Musketeer from your GY when a spell/trap is activated in her column. It has utility, but not enough to run at 3 or even 2. Plus, we can search her with Caspar anyways, so 1 copy is fine.  Now, the Spell/Traps. Most of these cards are the generic power cards, so I'll go over them first. 1 Raigeki, 3 Pot of Desires, 3 Cosmic Cyclone, 2 Called by the Grave, and 2 Forbidden Droplet. I'm not gonna go into extreme detail about them, I'll just briefly explain what they do and why I ran them over certain cards. Raigeki pops all your opponent's monsters. Pot of Desires banishes 10 cards from your deck for you to draw 2 cards. ""Why not run Extravagance or Prosperity?"" Because we enjoy our Extra Deck. Like, A LOT. We have extremely powerful cards in it that I don't want to get rid of, so I use Desires instead. Cosmic Cyclone allows you to pay 1000 LP for a Spell Speed 2 Spell/Trap banish. You can run Twin Twisters in this spot, but I'd rather not discard potentially game-winning starters and spell/traps to pop 2. Plus, Eldlich is a pain, so banishing cards is great! Called by the Grave is your way of saying ""I don't like being hand-trapped today, thank you though."" You usually never wanna get Ash'd with this deck, so running this card is a must. Forbidden Droplet allows you to send cards in your possession (field AND hand) to be able to negate the effects and halve the ATK of monsters equal to the amount of cards you sent. It also has the added bonus of your opponent not responding with cards if you sent cards of that type to the GY for the cost of the card. Which means theoretically, this is a Spell Speed 3 spell, which Spell Speed 3 is only for Counter Traps. You can honestly run Forbidden Chalice or Infinite Impermanance instead of this. Any of them are fine.  And the last of the main deck: our Magical Musket Spell/Traps. 3 Cross-Domination, 3 Desperado, 3 Last Stand, 1 Dancing Needle, and 1 Crooked Crown. Cross Domination is the archetype's ""Forbidden""-type quick-play spell, being able to negate any monster's effect and set their ATK value to 0. Desperado pops any face-up card on the field. Dancing Needle banishes up to 3 cards in any GY and banishes them. Its good for proactively banishing problematic cards in your opponent's GY. Crooked Crown allows you to special summon a Magical Musketeer from your hand and if you do, your opponent can't summon a monster in their monster zone in the column that your Musketeer was summoned in.  Now its time for the Extra Deck. Not gonna lie, space was a little tough trying to balance out the extra deck. At first, I wanted to run a Utopia OTK package with Utopia, Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing, but it didn't come up a lot, so I chose the Buster Lock, with Cherubini, Union Carrier, and Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. If you wanna go all in for this, I recommend running Cir and Graff, both Burning Abyss monsters. I did it without them because I think we have plenty of Level 3's Anyways, we got 3 Magical Musketeer Max, 2 Phantom Knights of Break Sword, 1 Abyss Dweller, 1 Tornado Dragon, 1 Bagooska, 1 Cherubini, 1 Knightmare Phoenix, 1 Union Carrier, 1 Masquerena, 1 Knightmare Unicorn, 1 Crusadia Avramax, and 1 Accesscode Talker.  Magical Musketeer Max is the strongest card in this deck. Going 2nd and summoning this card is a potential +5 in card advantage, which is INSANE for a Link 1 monster. When he's Link summoned, you can special summon Magical Musketeers from your deck equal to the amount of spell/traps your opponent control or he can grab Magical Musket spell/traps equal to the amount of monsters they have on their field, given the spell/traps have different names. Break Sword is a Generic Rank 3 Xyz monster that can pop one card you control and they control. I'll be honest, most Rank 3 Xyz monsters in the game are awful, so I think Break Sword is the one worth running. Abyss Dweller shuts down your opponent's GY effects for an entire turn as a Spell Speed 2 effect. Crazy. Tornado Dragon is a Spell Speed 2 Spell/Trap pop. Bagooska is the best stall card when it comes to Rank 4's, so we run him as a last resort when we need a turn or 2 to hopefully turn the tide. Cherubini and Union Carrier solely exist to perform the Buster Lock with Destruction Sword. If you want this to be consistent, run Cir and Graff in the main deck like how PK Rhongo Turbo uses them to get into Cherubini and other important Rank 3's. Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn are Spell/Trap pops and card bounces respectively, as long as you discard a card for cost. They are generically good link-climbing monsters. Crusadia Avramax is a Link 4 Boss Monster you can build up to, and it doesn't let your opponent target it with card effects and their monsters can only target him for attacks. Oh yeah, and when a special summoned monster attacks him, he can gain ATK equal to that monster's ATK during damage calc. Note that this is once per BATTLE, not once per TURN. And he floats into a shuffle when he's sent to the GY because of the opponent. And finally, Accesscode Talker. I have nothing to say about him. You should know he WILL end your game if summoned.  I'll go over possible inclusions for this deck that I didn't have: Utopia OTK package (Utopia, Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing), Graff and Cir (to help the Buster Lock), and every possible going second tool. This deck LOVES to go 2nd, so including cards like Lightning Storm, Harpie's Feather Duster, Evenly Matched, Dark Ruler No More, etc. are EXTREMELY good choices if you wanna go for it.  Anyways, that's it for these weirdos with guns. Have fun playing a mildly infuriating to go against deck and hopefully this guide helped you!"

Then, you can trigger the effect from the GY to get yourself back a monster (Cyberse Gadget gives you a token and Dotscaper Special Summons itself back to the field). Then, you're going to link away the Token//Dotscaper for a copy of Link Devote. Then, you're going to use Link Disciple's effect to tribute the Link Devotee to draw 1 card, then stack a card from your hand to the bottom of your deck. Then the effect of Link Devotee triggers since it was tributed, which gives you 2 tokens. Finally, you're going to link away the 2 tokens for a copy of I:P Masquerena. Along with this combo, you also run an Eldlich engine. With your Eldlich engine, you can also set lots of traps to interrupt your opponent's plays. Both of these engines allow for a great going first board and an equally great follow up. You also run the DPE package along with the Artifact Dagda + Sctythe, which stops your opponent from special summoning from the Extra Deck."

Scenario 1: Going first setting up a Scythe lock (typically the ideal scenario when going first)  The goal here is to get Scythe into the grave by the time your opponent's MP1 starts.  Example starting hand w/ out Adventurer: VW Lulu, VW Lili, VW Qinglong, Forbidden Droplet, E-Tele.  I like to start w/ a bait here, so I will typically open with the E-Tele to try and draw out an Ash to clear my way to go full combo.  However, the best play is to activate the Qinglong, then go for the Lulu Special Summon (SS) targeting Qinglong.  If that goes through, we continue.  If that gets negated, we are OK because we can still Normal Summon (NS) the Lulu further down the line.  Follow up w/ the SS of Lili, dumping a Nyannyan and a Chuche.  Now we are going to NS the Lulu, activating the effect of Nyan from grave to SS as a lv3 tuner.  If there is a serious concern about Nibiru here, you can hold off on the Nyan summon as we will not get the omni-negate in this scenario until our 6th summon.  If not, then proceed w/ the Nyan SS.  Activate the Chuche, bump up the Lulu to lv6, XYZ into Beatrice.  Activate Beatrice, dump Water Enchantress.  Activate Enchantress, get the Rite, go full Adventurer combo to get token &amp; Gryphon + Dracoback.  Now we have Beatrice (w/1 material), Token, Gryphon, Fateful, Dracoback on field, E-Tele and Droplet.  Activate E-Tele to go get Lulu, then if you have not already activated Nyan we can now activate from GY to SS.  Synchro Gryphon and Lulu into Baronne, pass turn.  On opponent's Standby, first activate Beatrice to detach the material and dump Artifact Scythe.  As a follow-up, in a separate Chain, activate Baronne to SS the Scythe sent to the GY.  If there is a negate activated, use Baronne's ability to omni-negate.  Boom - no ED activity from your opponent on that turn."

YOU WILL BRICK, but when you get a good hand you can OTK or outlast yo","Goal is to get out as many Lv. 8 monsters to Xyz into Draglubion --&gt; then get out Hope Harbinger for spell negate or Numeron Dragon for damage. Lots of revive cards so getting Blue-Eyes in GY helps. Spirit dragon negates GY effects, and you can use its effect to get Azure-Eyes out to protect your dragons. Duplicates of Xyzs mainly used as ammo for Draglubion's effect. Heart-eartH and Zeus used defensively. Not sure when new Blue-Eyes support will be added to Master Duel but will definitely make it into the deck. Add more hand traps if you can afford it.  Spirit of White can pop an opponent's Skill Drain if you chain its second effect to tribute it for a Blue-Eyes in your hand (skill drain only affects cards on the field).  Brick-Eyes is a problem, add draw cards if you have them. You can also use Cards of Consonance, Trade-In, and Burst Stream as bait set cards if you can't use them at the time (you'd be surprised how many people will waste back-row clear on them). Ash Blossom kinda ruins your plays, so add Called by the Grave if you can afford it.  True Light 's risks can be somewhat negated with either Azure-Eyes or Ultimate Creature of Destruction.  Future fusion used primarily to dump 5 cards to graveyard (white stone and blue eyes using 5-headed dragon as target) for effects and combo with RotDL.  &nbsp;"

First turn you can use Junk Connector to get a Lv. 2 in the GY then bring him back with Junk Synchron to get Junk Speeder. You can also use Synchron Carrier to get an extra normal summon for Junk Synchron. If you already have JS you can use Tuning to get Satellite Synchron for the Special Summon when you use JS's effect.  Revive spells and traps work well with Doppel Warrior and Satellite Synchron's effects.  If you can get out Clear Wing, Stardust Dragon, and Black Rose out at the same time you're pretty well set.  Synchronized Real can either be really good or absolute trash depending on when you draw it --&gt; might be worth switching out for handtraps.  Traps are mainly just what I had available, feel free to swap out for better UR's like Imperm. Paleozoic can be used to dump a Lv. 2 to the GY and its second effect can be comboed with Doppel Warrior or Satellite Synchron."

Ratio of Madolche cards in the deck is pretty much perfect, though if you need room you can remove 1 Magileine and maybe run Madolche nights if you feel you need another target for Salon. Side deck includes a number of cards that i have tested and consider good valid options depending on the meta. Madolche Promenade is to me the most important card of this deck and by far the best and most underrated Madolche card, it gives you a searchable negate and made all other madolche traps either obsolete or just mostly redundant in the case of nights. It gives you a GY play to add Brickingcess as a material to your boss monsters and it's the most consistent disruption you have. It's a shame it's once per turn.  You really don't want to be running more than 1 ticket. 2 Chateau does give you some other plays but it loses you consistency. 3 Salon is redundant. The boss madolches are all fine at 2, no reason to run 3 of any of them as you can recycle them easily if needed. Brickingcess's crucial as XYZ mat for Chocolat as well as the best target for Petingcessoeur to combo into Tiaramisu or Glassouflé that said you don't want to draw into her at all, hence the nickname and why you only want 1 copy of her.  Barrier statue is an excellent floodgate that stops your opponent but not you, though it costs a normal summon, Rescue cat is something i'm testing and it gives you a 1 card combo to summon two hootcakes to overlay into Leviair and maybe bring back a banished Anjelly as well in the process, though beware it won't work if you have used Petingcessoeur's effect in the same turn, but you can still use her effect afterwards.  Currently waiting for some new cards to be added, namely Small World and Vernalizer Fairies so i can improve madolche's turn 1 board, as it is the best you can do is usually Sistart + Glassouflé with a face up Salon and a set Promenade. It's very consistent and not bad, but not enough to deal with meta and not even remotely close to the oppressive boards most modern decks can do turn 1."

ChengYing synergises so well with Eater, Orochi (that we have as a 4 of with foolish burial)... It s kinda crazy.  Super poly can be played in this deck, but you'll have to save extra deck space for it.  Kaijus are playable but you miss space. That's why I used Lava Golem. Ra Sphere mode does not work here because it needs to be normal summoned and clashed to much with the castle.  Another idea is to use mind control to get back lava golem (it's level 8) or any monster from the opponent that could be treated as lvl 8 for XYZ summon the new Vampire xyz monster...  The side is mainly going first cards, which you'll need if you win the first game going second.  A lot of option for a great and modern Gren Maju Deck!!"
