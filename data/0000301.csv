<span> </span>

<span>            Just so everyone is clear, Tier 0 does not do any justice for this, the ultimate deck. there should be a new tier (Ojama Tier) just for the new best deck in the game. The King of Games himself could not come up with a better deck list to compete with this masterpiece</span>

<span>Jokes aside, this isn't meant to be a good deck. It's meant to make your opponent say ""This is stupid"" and ""What am I looking at"". This deck will brick, 25% of it is normal monsters after all. There's no hand traps, there's nothing to stop your opponent from slapping down Ash Blossom or an Effect Veiler. There's  not a ton of options if you don't get Ojama Blue quickly, and the whole thing falls apart if your opponent doesn't have an attack position monster with 2600 or less attack. That being said, this is a fun goofy deck that combos like crazy once it gets started. So the main thing is have fun</span>

<span> </span>

<span> </span>
<p><span><b>THE MAIN COMBO</b></span></p>
<span>      1.Normal summon Ojama Blue, have it attack an opponent's attack position monster so Blue gets destroyed. (you can also use normal summon Rescue Cat to activate its effect if you have it) </span>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ojama Blue activates, searches out Ojamagic and Ojamatch.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use Ojamatch to discard Ojamagic and search out Ojama Blue and Armed Dragon Thunder LV3, then normal summon Ojama Blue. Ojamagic will resolve by adding Ojama Green, Ojama Yellow, and Ojama Black to your Hand.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Have Ojama Blue attack an opponent's attack position monster so Blue gets destroyed.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ojama Blue activates, searching for Ojamagic and Ojamatch.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use Ojamatch to discard Ojamagic and search out Ojama Blue and Armed Dragon Thunder LV3, then normal summon Ojama Blue. Ojamagic will resolve by adding Ojama Green, Ojama Yellow, and Ojama Black to your Hand.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Have Ojama Blue attack an opponent's attack position monster so Blue gets destroyed.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ojama Blue activates, but this time add two copies of Ojamassimilation to your hand</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>End your battle phase and use Ojamassimilation to reveal XYZ-Dragon Cannon from your Extra Deck, banish three copies of Ojama Blue from your graveyard to summon X-Head Cannon, Y-Dragon Head, and Z-Metal Tank from your deck. Any time after this step, you can banish either Ojamassimilation or Ojamatch to shuffle 3 banished Ojamas back to the Deck, and draw one card.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Banish from the field X-Head Cannon, Y-Dragon Head, and Z-Metal Tank to Contact Fusion XYZ-Dragon cannon  to the field. </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use XYZ-Dragon Cannons effect to destroy as many cards your opponent controls as possible, by discarding Ojamas (6 in hand) and Armed Dragon Thunder LV3 (2 in hand)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use Ojamassimilation to reveal ABC-Dragon Buster from your Extra Deck, banish 1 Ojama Green, 1 Ojama Yellow, and 1 Ojama Black from your Hand or Graveyard (one of each normal Ojama is sent in case you have your third Ojamagic in your hand, draw into it, or search it out using a recycled Ojama Blue or Ojama pajama) to summon A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, and C-Crush Wyvern from your deck. </span></li>
</ol>
<span> </span>

<span>                         This is where the combo can diverge a bit depending on what you have in the Hand, Field, and Graveyard. It can also diverge a bit depending what you want on the field. So bear with me, as these next steps are just possibilities based on the aforementioned factors. </span>

<span> </span>
<p><span><b>SCENARIO A</b></span></p>
<span>            If you have either a normal or effect monster on the Field that is not listed in the combo (like if you had normal summoned a monster on a previous turn and it's still there), or are able to get a monster on the Field via some effect (like if you used Rescue Cat in step 1 of the Main Combo, or have Ojama Duo in the Graveyard from a previous turn, your best option in general is Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess. If this is the route you want to go, Apollousa will be your Omni-negate and the following steps will look like this:</span>

<span>        A.13. Link summon Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess using A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, C-Crush Wyvern, and the extra monster on the field</span>

<span>        A.14. Banish from the Graveyard A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, and C-Crush Wyvern to contact fusion summon ABC-Dragon Buster from your Extra Deck</span>

<span>         </span>

<span>            You end on: ABC-Dragon Buster, XYZ-Dragon Cannon, and Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess with 3200 attack (4 negates). Not horrible, But we can do better.</span>

<span> </span>
<p><span><b>SCENARIO B</b></span></p>
<span>            If you have the capacity to get two extra monsters on the field that are not listed in the combo (Ojama Duo or some other means), then you will want to summon Borrelend Dragon one of 2 ways. </span>

<span>            If you Ojama Duo in the Graveyard from a previous turn, and have Ojama Red in the Deck the steps will look like this:</span>

<span>          B.I.13. Link summon Knightmare Unicorn using A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, and C-Crush Wyvern on the field. </span>

<span>          B.I.14. Banish Ojama Duo to summon Ojama Red and Ojama Blue from the Deck (you will have to have shuffled Ojama blue back into the deck using Ojamassimilation or Ojamatch by this point)</span>

<span>           B.I.15. Use Ojama Red, Ojama Blue, and Knightmare Unicorn to Link summon Borrelend Dragon.</span>

<span>           B.I.16. Use A-Assault Core, B-Buster Drake, and C-Crush Wyvern from the Graveyard to Contact Fuse ABC-Dragon Buster from the Extra Deck.</span>

<span>           B.I.17. Use ABC-Dragon Buster and XYZ-Dragon cannon to Contact Fuse A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon to the field.</span>

<span>         </span>

<span>           You end on A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon (as many negates as you can discard) and Borrelend Dragon. Again not a bad board. </span>

<span>           but, you don't always have Ojama blue. So what do you do in these situations? For that we have:</span>

<span> </span>
<p><span><b>WHAT DO DO WHEN NO BLUE</b></span></p>
<span>           So the best option is to get Ojama blue as fast as possible. Unfortunately this will most likely be by drawing it as you only have three searchers, Ojama Blue being one of them. so you can do your best to stall and crack open an ABC-Dragon Buster to the Field to save you, or you can Xyz summon. If you have Galaxy Soldier and 2 light monsters in your hand, you can summon Cyber Dragon Infinity for a good negate. Or you can attack with it and go into Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - sky Thunder for a nuclear option. The other monster is Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu, which can make a token that has an attack equal to whatever is highest in the field for a big beat stick. The same rules apply to number 64 into ZEUS but it only has 1000 attack to swing with. Aside from that, draw the out or cry. </span>

<span> </span>

<span>Thank you all for coming to my Ted Talk.</span>

<span> </span>

<span> </span>

<span>Ojama yellow is my Waifu I refuse to elaborate further, Gooday</span>"

It not only sets up most of your plays but also has two incredible effects and one relevant effect. The first lets you send a lunalight monster from deck or extra, which in most cases will be a yellow marten (if you did not open one), panther dancer (to setup wolf for the current turn or next), or crimson fox. This send to grave is a COST (be careful of effects that banish any card sent to grave; you won't be able to activate the effect at all). On master duel a lot of people make the mistake of negating kaleido chick to turn off the name change but that&rsquo;s not what she is used for mostly. If you do get the name change and can make leo dancer, then go for it.</p><p>The other important effect is the on banish. Once kaleido chick is banished you can wrap up the game as your opponent wont be able to activate cards or effects during the battle phase. You banish chick two ways here; either by wolf to fusion summon or by allure of darkness.</p><p>The final effect is the add back of poly. Don't discount this. There are times when you can ditch the poly for the perfume or serenade dance and then get it back later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lunalight Wolf [Miracle Fusion/Pierce Access/SOFT ONCE PER TURN]</p><p>Wolf is there to make your fusions using the grave. Make whatever the situation calls for. Since you don't always need to normal summon, you can normal summon the wolf after using its effect and bouncing it to hand with yellow marten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lunalight Tiger [Playmaker/Rank 4 Maker/SOFT ONCE PER TURN]</p><p>If you do not open with tiger, find a way to access it. You can do this a couple of ways like adding with tenki or perfume, sending to grave with chick and using black sheep, special off serenade dance and bouncing with yellow marten, etc. Because tiger is a soft once per turn you can use the effect to special from grave as many times as you can play the card.</p><p>The most common use: activate in scale, special a lunalight, yellow marten in grave or hand to bounce tiger, and reactivate tiger to special another lunalight.</p><p>This was abused in the past which is why its a 1 currently in the tcg. Tiger's other effect is its on destruction special from grave. This does work if it is destroyed in the scale and can be combo'd with daruma doll to pop back row while getting back any lunalight from grave (usally chick).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lunalight Yellow Marten/Emerald Bird [Extenders]</p><p>Yellow marten: You can bounce your cards to reset them and be used as easy material for a rank 4. You can get the sent to grave effect by using her for fusion summoning, the effect Redoer, sending off serenade dance, or for emerald birds draw. What you search is mostly lunalight fusion but if you have a way to get serenade dance to the grave you can go for that too.</p><p>Emerald bird: The send to draw helps setup and can bait out certain hand traps. You can also get the sent to grave effect with the same methods as yellow marten. Bringing back a banished kaleido chick will let you send another lunalight to grave or you bring back yellow marten to keep it in rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lunalight Black Sheep: Add poly to hand, bait out negates, if used for a fusion you can add back your wolf/tiger in grave or extra deck.</p><p>Lunalight Crimson Fox: Changes to atk of opponent&rsquo;s monster to 0, gives targeting protection while in grave</p><p>Lunalight Blue Cat: Doubles the original atk if special summoned (will not include bonus increases like tenki), has a floating effect. The early builds ran multiple because you could summon blue cat off blue cat then go into tiger which could summon back the blue cat effectively make an attack block chain. I suggest beginners run 2 otherwise 1 is fine.</p><p>Lunalight Purple Butterfly: Gives a lunalight 1k atk, usually sent off kaleido chick, can special the blue cat/wolf/bird/chick in hand by banishing from grave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spells and Traps:</p><p>Tenki: Search any lunalight outside wolf</p><p>Allure: Helps draw and can banish kaleido chick</p><p>Foolish Burial Goods: Sends perfume or serenade dance, can bait out hand traps or negates if played first</p><p>Harpies/Lightning Storm: Get rid of back row or problematic monsters before going full combo</p><p>Luna Light Perfume: NOT a lunalight card, monster reborn for the archetype, can get cards from hand to grave but is a COST, adds any lunalight from main deck (mostly searches wolf), NOT once per turn.</p><p>Lunalight Fusion: The shaddoll fusion of the archetype that can send from extra deck, can bait or be negated by ash blossom</p><p>Monster Reborn: Bring back key pieces</p><p>Called By The Grave: Stop hand traps or get rid of important monsters in grave</p><p>Lunalight Serenade Dance [Playmaker]: Can send a card from hand to grave, special usually kaleido chick from deck, can play a second copy if needed</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Deck:</p><p>Lunalight Fusions: Make Leo Dancer or whatever the situation calls for. You can go into Sabre dancer as a first turn play to setup its grave effect or use it later as a finisher.</p><p>Rank 4s:</p><p>Tiger king: Access to tenki as well as board wide negate.</p><p>Time Thief Redoer [Extender/Best Friend]: His effect sends the materials to grave which triggers the lunalights. Most often you will be detaching yellow marten to search for lunalight fusion. Is also a dark monster and can be used to make starving venom if needed.</p><p>Number 41: Bagooska: This card is plan B if you cannot win the game with your current setup. Keep him in defense as long as you need to build up resources and make sure to put him in atk before fusion summoning.</p><p>Abyss Dweller: Good for times where you have to go first &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Links:</p><p>Daruma Doll: Read Lunalight Tiger</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last tip is to pay attention to what order you play your cards and how the opponent reacts. Hopefully this, along with my replay videos, will help newer players get more familiar with the archetype.</p><p>https://youtu.be/IcBt2QkhPgA</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>"

Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Fissure and Dimension shifter help support the latter. Both Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure help continue cleaning up the grave for Dimensional Shifter to continue being viable after turn 1. Floowandereeze Stri can also be used to clean own graveyard up for Dimensional Shifter to work. The deck is built to try and support Dimensional Shifter as much as possible while balancing Floowandereeze board presence.

&nbsp;

There are enough search cards in the deck to work through disruption. If boards are too difficult to work through then Dark Ruler No More can be subbed in for the Harpie's spell/traps.

Gold Sarcophagus (In my opinion) is highly being underestimated in Floowandereeze builds. It can banish a small Floowandereeze to recur back to hand once another small Flowandereeze has been normal summoned (not having to wait for Gold Sarcophagus' to fully resolve) or it can search any other card in the deck non-searchable (most often very useful for searching Dark Ruler No More or Called by the Grave)

What's the harm? It probably won't work, but let's see if it can!"". And, I've got to admit, It Works. We use ZS Ascended Sage to search Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force or Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force, flood the field with Inzektors to make two Lv 7's, sue Saryuja Skull Dread to draw into our other Rank-Up spell, and make a meaty Gossip Shadow to attach as material to our Dyson Sphere. Our Plan B, if this doesn't work, is to make Utopia Dragner, summon out Diablosis the Mind Hacker and rip a card from the opponent's extra deck, then use The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch to make D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on the opponent's turn, locking them out of activated effects on the field. I don't know if this deck is good, but its fun, and its an interesting take on Inzektor that I haven't seen represented yet.

Honestly, I just love volcanics as an engine to get card advantage. not only does Blaze Accelerator Reload turn all of my volcanic shells into recurring +1 draws and obviously scattershot is so fun when your opponent spams out an insane board, but I also like how it's hard to just remove BAR from the field without giving a free scattershot. Pot of Avarice and Royal Firestorm guards are great card advantage as well as reset the scattershots to be flung again. The problem with my previous attempts is that even IF I net card advantage uninterrupted and within a timely manner, I kept drawing trash cards. So, I removed the trash and added some Junk. The inception of this deck was trying to find a purpose for shell after searching one to hand, if there was no blaze accelerator to pitch it to. Crystron Quan seemed like an amazing fit. He can throw shell out on the opponent's turn to make Formula Synchron, get +1 card on summon and now shell is in the grave and can use his effect on each of my turns. the level 4 pieces of the volcanics engine can also be used for Crystron Ametrix in a pinch. But then I stumbled into something fascinating, a card that would allow Volcanics to use spent pieces in new ways. Enter Celestial Double Star Shaman. This card is easy enough to summon using shell and any level 1 tuner, and then can bring out all of the scattershots fetched to grave by their effect for an 8 star synchro all at once, for exactly accel synchro stardust dragon who, on summon, brings back the CDSS, replaces itself with stardust dragon and what do you know that's exactly what we need for Shooting Star Dragon. Now we have a surprise boss monster waiting in our extra deck to be formed from the spent pieces of the volcanics engine. This should be much more consistent than that silly old rekindling strategy which can't utilize the volcanics at all and has to be drawn from main.

Youtube link inside!","<p>An updated, more Masterduel version of my Charmer Control deck I featured back in my previous charmer decklists. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/charming-control-2022/"">For a more detailed explanation of this deck, click here.</a></p>
<p>The idea is to go first, control the board, then OTK. OTKs are easily enabled by ""Awakening of the Possessed"" boosting up your monster's attack to ridiculous levels for each attribute on your field. The Dogmatika cards provide free special summons/attributes for the OTK, as well as interactions that hinder your opponent. Lord of the Heavenly Prison also greatly enhances the deck, since it is a massive free body on board, protects backrow and searches out any of your important spells like Pot of Extravagance, Spirit Charmers, or Nadir's Servant. Ice Dragon's Prison and Crackdown are the normal traps of choice for this deck, since they eviscerate current meta decks and also provide link material so you can link your opponent's monster away for your Extra Deck charmers.</p>

I only run 1 <a data-name=""Mathmech Multiplication"">Mathmech Multiplication</a> because that is all you need for this deck, ideally to go into <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> targeting either <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> or <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> to get to 5300 attack and then double it for 10600 attack, for an easy OTK with Accesscode popping everything else on the board

I run <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> because its really big and hard to remove while setting up an OTK using <a data-name=""Multiplication"">Multiplication </a>and possibly <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a> too if it's in your hand

I run<a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramaxx""> Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramaxx </a>as a link 4 to go into using<a data-name=""I:P""> I:P</a> on your opponents turn as it protects your other monsters from battle and is untargetable.

I run 3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>, 3 <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Impermanence"">Impermanence</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and I feel as though these are all hand traps and going 2nd cards that most if not every deck should be playing (You could also play<a data-name=""Psy-framegear Gamma""> Psy-framegear Gamma</a>, a very good going second card but i would personally put it in the side deck for when you know you're going second. You could also play <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet </a>but I personally think that Dark Ruler No More can do enough without needing to get rid of your own cards too)

Some unique side deck choices could be Mischief of the Gnomes just for Spright as it is going to appear literally everywhere but it is a bit slow."

Your gameplan is just to put up some field pops and stay save with Rafale on 1st turn using IP to stay save, so you can get an emergency pop or backup Apollousa in case your backrow cant special summon.
For turn 2 you just gotta brute force your way through negates having draw cards like desires as well as reasoning and rookie Fur Hire allows you to really punish handtraps like imperm and effect veiler or dodge pops."

It does struggle going second since it relies heavily on opponent's summoning; always go first for that matter. It may fight back in Turn 2, but with Master Duel's current format, it's harsh and slim.</p><p>There are a few scenarios for setup in the deck. The deck contains extenders such as Parallel eXceed and The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine. Always use them whenever possible. Your first action is always to summon a Traptrix monster onto the field, then Link Summon <a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>. Normal Summon the following Traptrix Monsters in priority:</p><ol><li>If you have <a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a>, search for a Trap Hole card depending on your hand. If you have <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a>, then search for a different one like <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a>. Diversify your back row for more interactions. If you have a lot of Trap Cards in hand, better to Normal Summon <a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a> instead.</li><li>If you have <a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a>, search for <a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>; said monster will be able to generate more advantage on the next turn. If you have a lot of monsters in hand, it's better to Normal Summon <a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a> instead.</li><li>If you have <a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a>, Special Summon <a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a> for opponent back row removal. <a data-name=""Traptrix Mantis"">Traptrix Mantis</a> may also work as activating her effect will trigger <a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>.</li></ol><p>If you have a lot of back row and an extender is available, it is best to summon <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> to search for <a data-name=""Lord of Heavenly Prison"">Lord of Heavenly Prison</a> which will protect your back row. However, if you do not have much trap cards, it is better to summon <a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Traptrix Rafflesia</a> instead.</p><p>For <a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>'s Special Summon, be watchful of your opponent's cards. You can special summon Traptrix monsters with varying effects from your Deck to gain rolling advantage. <a data-name=""Traptrix Myrmeleo"">Traptrix Myrmeleo</a> is the best target for back row removal. <a data-name=""Traptrix Dionaea"">Traptrix Dionaea</a> can recycle your Trap Hole cards. <a data-name=""Traptrix Atrax"">Traptrix Atrax</a> can prevent your traps from being negated.</p><p>For <a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Traptrix Sera</a>'s Trap Hole search effect, diversify the back row as usual.</p><p>That's really it on how to play them. The next turns are all about destroying your opponent's choke points and seal the game with either:</p><ol><li>Wearing down your opponent to oblivion.</li><li>Utopia Double OTK.</li></ol>"

The main goal is to create a 5k The Arrival Cyberse @Ignsiter, with the potential to get it to 6k if you have an extender like Hiyari or A.I.dle Reborn.

Mathmech Diameter is a card that could be cut as a lot of different hands are unable to utilize it (i.e. you can't afford to normal summon it or discard it in any way)

The handtrap lineup and side deck are also things that could be adjusted, as I'm not 100% sure what to do with those in general (and much less with the entirely new format)"

Summon big monsters. Pitch the cryptids. Summon big monsters.,"Ancient snake deities and legendary cryptids...who could ask for more?

The goal of this Deck is to use a wide variety of discard effects to fill up the GY with Ogdoadics so you can activate their powerful effects. The obvious first choice is Snake Rain, which if you have one in hand can get five of these cards into the grave. Didn't draw Snake Rain? No problem. There's also Ogdoadic Water Lily which, although it's nowhere near as crazy as Snake Rain, can still get your main starter Nunu into the GY to start your plays (of course, if you draw both Water Lily and Snake Rain, then you can use Water Lily's second effect to revive ANY reptile from the grave). If neither of those are an option, there's always the Dangers!, which can allow you to pitch any Ogdoadics in your hand and gain card advantage to boot (if luck's on your side and your opponent doesn't snipe the Dangers! instead).

Besides the Ogdoadics and the Dangers!, this Deck also utilizes some of the generic reptile support that's been released over the years. Reptillianne Coatl can Special Summon herself if a DARK reptile is on the field (of which the Deck plays several) and is a Level 4 Tuner that opens the way for Sychro plays (Reptilianne Melusine can't be destroyed by battle or card effects if all her materials were reptiles, which they almost always will be; PSY-Framelord Omega can get banished Ogdoadics back in the GY to activate their effects the following turn; and Scrap Dragon can pop one of your opponent's troublesome cards). A small Alien package consisting of Alien Shocktropper M-Frame, Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll and Alien Overlord make use of A-counters to help swarm the field and weaken your opponent. Dark Alligator can Special Summon itself by tributing 1 Reptile and then Summons a token for each tribute used to bring it out (fun fact, this isn't once per turn, so if you have three Alligators in hand, you can Summon the first, use the token to Summon the second, and use its token to Summon the third, giving you three Level 8 monsters plus a Level 1 token to boot). Fresh out of Power of the Elements comes Vanguard of the Underground Emporer, which can Special Summon itself if a monster is discarded by the effects of one of your Dangers!, and Therion ""Empress"" Alasia, which can make use of the reptiles in the GY to Special Summon herself...or if you have Fum in grave, you can equip her with that instead and either Special Summon it with Alasia's effect or use it to bounce one of your opponent's cards.

Is this Deck competitive? Probably not. Any number of hand traps will stop it dead in its tracks, and it doesn't play any of its own. Can it snatch a victory or two from unsuspecting duelists who've never read the effects of the Ogdoadics and don't know which effects they need to stop? Absolutely."

With the new support they've received out of Power of the Elements, Melffys are now even more capable of producing all manner of power Synchro monsters (provided they have an even level of course). You can even summon out the immensely powerful Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity to completely shut down your opponent for an entire turn. Beyond that, it makes use of several ""Second Turn Synchros"" like Formula Synchron, Crystron Quandax, Desert Locusts, and their enablers like Crystron Halqifibrax and Hop Ear Squadron to make use of the Melffys' swarming capabilities during your opponent's turn.

Now, other than the robust Melffy core this Deck utilizes, it also employs the varied beast support that has been released over the years. Beast-oriented staples like Kalantosa, Valerifawn, and Rescue Cat need no explanation, nor does Alpha, the Master of Beasts I'm sure. The one suspect inclusion here is Egotistical Ape, but here's my reasoning: because this deck is playing a wide assortment of recursion tools (Ayers Rock Sunrise, Melffy Tag, Monster Reborn, Melffy Hide-and-Seek), Ape's discard cost isn't a huge issue, and because you don't have to waste your Normal Summon on it, this means it can be used alongside cards like Rescue Cat to get enough materials on board to go into Crystron Halqifibrax and open up all kinds of plays. Here's an example:
<ul>
 	<li>You have Ape, White Steed, Rescue Cat, and two other cards in hand, one of which is a Level 4 or lower beast</li>
 	<li>You Normal Summon Rescue Cat and activate its effect, summoning two beasts (one Tuner and one non-Tuner)</li>
 	<li>You then Special Summon White Steed and use the Tuner you summoned along with White Steed to Synchro Summon Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</li>
 	<li>You then Special Summon Ape, pitching the beast in your hand for cost, and then, using Ape and the other beast you Summoned off of Rescue Cat, go into Halq</li>
 	<li>You then use Halq's effect to summon any Level 2 Tuner from your Deck and pass the turn</li>
 	<li>Then, on your opponent's turn, you banish Halq for Forumla Synchron, draw your card, and then use it, the Level 2 Tuner, and Scarlight to go into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity (see, I told you it was possible)</li>
</ul>
Is this Deck competitive? No, absolutely not. Any number of handtraps stop this thing dead in its tracks, and it doesn't play any of its own. Is it fun, and can it snatch a victory or two if your opponent draws poorly and isn't expecting it? Absolutely."

This build of the deck has the goal of making its endboards as consistent as possible. For this we play 3x Red Layer 3x Fire Flint and so on. Since Auroradon was banned the deck is unfortunately not a 1 card combo deck anymore, but a 2 card combo deck. The new variant has many positive sides like the high constant or or the possibilities to break boards. But still it has weaknesses like the bad recovery or the high handtrap vulnerability.... The build is inspired by Team COG's deck. The test hand video is below in the link:

A Deck to instantly win the Duel using Flying Elephant-DESU.

","[Deck Concept] [Deck Recipe] “Flying Elephant” Deck by NeoArkadia

A Deck that aims to win using the effect of “Flying Elephant” from Collectors Pack 2018.

In order to activate the 2nd effect of “Flying Elephant”, you must use its 1st effect, and in order to do it, you’ll need to use “Give &amp; Take” and “Creature Swap” to give control of “Yajiro Invader” to your opponent.

By activating “Back to the Front” or “Call of the Haunted” during the opponent’s turn, you can Special Summon “Flying Elephant” to have it be Special Summoned to a Monster Zone to be destroyed by “Yajiro Invader”

You can Special Summon “Flying Elephant” from the Deck with the effect of “Summoner Monk”, as well as add it from the Deck to your hand with the effect of “Desmanian Devil”.

Discard “Yajiro Invader” or “Flying Elephant” from your hand to the GY to activate the effect of “Lightning Vortex”, and then follow up by Special Summoning them from the GY."

All wh","<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>This is a more basic decklist moreso meant to share an idea to other Spright players, though with a consistency tweak, this deck can be played legitimately, and it's already better than vanilla Spright, but I'd question it's terms with Twin Spright. &nbsp; I love Ghostrick and always wanted an excuse to play them. So when I realized Socuteboss and Nekomusume were level/rank 2, I lost my mind, I could force smash them with Spright so I could play them finally. This deck is a Spright Frog deck modified to summon one of 3 fusion monsters and the fun floodgate Ghostrick Nekomusume, Who flips all level 4 or higher monsters your opponent plays face down when they are summoned, Stopping Decks like swordsoul, P.U.N.K, and Despia from building their boards(The effect is an activated effect, meaning it can't be chained to by spell speed [I'm unsure if quick effects can be activated before the flip].) It also has an XYZ monster with an instant win effect, and while inefficient, its a fun way to win, and its not that xyz monsters only use. This deck also plays Secret Village of the Spellcasters, and is able to play spells while it is up. The deck's recovery seems to suck though, so once you make a strong board you have to keep it that way. I'm pretty new to fooling around with Spright, so any advice is appreciated, but lets get on with it(I'll be going over mostly card uses rather than combos as this isn't a combo heavy build): &nbsp; <strong>Card Uses;</strong> &nbsp; Cyber-stein- Cyber stein is a Fusion hack who is either drawn &amp; normal summoned, searched with small world &amp; normal summoned, or sent to the gy and summoned to the field with Spright Sprind and Spright Elf respectively. <em>Combo-&nbsp;</em>In the later case, use it's effect to summon your fusion monster(default is DPE), then overlay it and a Spright link monster for Gigantic Spright. GSpright then detaches Cyber stein to summon Swap frog. Swap frog sends Ronintoadin from the deck to the gy, then returns itself to the hand to summon itself again to send Swap frog from the deck to the gy. Ronintoadin banishes Swap frog from the gy to special summon itself, then overlay both frogs into Toadally Awesome. Cyber stein has Three fusion targets;</p><ol><li>Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. Anyone whos suffered through the age of Verte DPE knows why this card is good, It made Yubel too efficient. Jokes aside, This card destroys itself to destroy an opponents card via a quick effect, and it summons itself back to the field next standby phase. In this deck, your opponent may try to normal summon a level 3 monster to attack over Ghostrick Nekomusume, so DPE can destroy itself and that monster to protect your floodgate. It can also just break a play by removing an important combo piece, or stop Skill drain/Mystic mine before its effect resolves.</li><li>Naturia Exterio. Eldlich/Dinomorphia harassing you again? Throw your deck into the nearest trash can and set it on fire. This fusion monster lets you negate every spell and trap your opponent throws at you until you run out of cards in your deck to send to the gy, and cards in your gy to banish. In short, no Super polymerization, Solemn card, Forbidden droplet,&nbsp; or golden land forever, and they have no way to play the game. This also just kills every decks backrow, and for some reason, Konami thought it was ok to keep this card around after making Cyber-Stein searchable in legit every deck.</li><li>Last but not least, the legend himself, Ojama King! And sadly, this is probably the closest you'll get to Ojama being in the top ranks. Ojama king is a wall that locks 3 of your opponents monster zones. Socuteboss can lock 1 per turn if your opponent decides to summon a monster with low attack(this works against Spright as they all have low ATK), and Nekomusume can flip whatever was in the open Zone face down, rendering it useless. So yeah, imagine dealing with Splight frog, but you can't use monster zones, and if they drew the field spell, not being allowed to use spells either. Better hope you packed a kaiju.</li></ol><p>&nbsp; That's all on Cyber-stein(and Frogs if you read the combo). Just keep in mind that you're paying 5000LP for that fusion monster. &nbsp; Ghostrick- Ghostrick are what put this deck build apart from the rest. Now, I couldn't do all the flipping shenanigans, but they do more than enough to have a place in the deck's title. Ghostrick Nekomusume; This is your fun floodgate. As long as you control another Ghostrick(Festival, Angel, or Socuteboss), Any level 4 or higher monster your opponent summons is flipped face down upon summon, and this can't start a chain with spell speed 1 effects, though I'm unsure about 2 and up. This semi-shuts down pretty much all your meta foes except Adventure, Prank Kids, and Spright. It can be summoned with Ghostrick Shot or Gigantic Splight, or be normal summoned while you control Mummy, Angel, Festival, or Socuteboss. This card has below average stats for it's level, and is usually kept protected by locking your opponent down, or DPE destroying it's attacker. &nbsp; Ghostrick Festival; Nekomusume searcher and keeps Nekomusume's effect active, Mummy is usually used as it's material. &nbsp; Ghostrick Socuteboss; This rank 2 can be used to keep Nekomusume's effect active, lock zones alongside Ojama king, or be overlayed into Ghostrick Angel.&nbsp; It's the only Ghostrick able to keep Nekomusume's effect active if you activated Spright Starter. &nbsp; Ghostrick Angel; This card has 4 uses, and ends up with 3-5 material turn 1-</p><ol><li>Keep Ghostrick Nekomusume's effect active.</li><li>Auto win the duel in a MINIMUM of 3 turns via reaching 10 xyz materials, usually done to put the opponent in a panic or make the flashy finish. Bonus points for drinking a bottle of Sprite while doing so.</li><li>She can search Ghostrick Shot to summon Nekomusume from the hand or gy(Sometimes it will end up as material for Angel, and this gets it to the field.)</li><li>At 2/4/6/8 materials, it can be used as material for Zeus, who can wipe the entire board 1/2/3/4 times. Who needs Zoodiac?</li></ol><p>And That's that for Ghostrick, the other cards are just in the deck as Angel material and Small world targets. Although I have made Toadally Awesome in clutch off of Ghostrick Sirens effect once lol. &nbsp; Spright- Spright pretty much play themselves. Summon a level 2 then dump your hand on the board(All 5 Spright can special summon themselves from the hand.) You want to try and not use Spright red as it's a monster negate, but don't be afraid to use it if its necessary. Spright are an easy deck to figure out, but take a lot of words to fully explain, so piecing what I say next and what was learned from the Cyber-Stein part about Frog, you should get it in a few runs. I'll explain what to do on an average bad hand; You'll usually end up only able to summon 4 Spright if Jet, Blue, or Starter is amongst the three Spright in your hand. Summon both link monsters to send/summon Cyber-stein, then your fusion target. Overlay Cyber-stein and Sprind into GSpright. Now, detach Cyber-stein to summon Spright red, or, if you haven't normal summoned yet, Swap frog and make Toadally awesome. Ending with a 3200 beatstick, DPE, Toadally Awesome/Spright Red, and Spright Elf who can revive Toadally awesome so it can negate twice. So on an average bad hand, you get the usual Spright end board plus DPE. &nbsp; That's all for this decklist, so as always, hope you enjoyed! &nbsp; P.S I'd appreciate if a more skilled Spright player could modify it to be more efficient. &nbsp; <strong>UPDATE 1:&nbsp;</strong> Just added crossout designator and targets for it.</p>"

My goal is to build a set of Krawler decks, exploring the combos that exist and trying to solve the deck's main problems. This build will focus on pure Krawlers, no other main-deck engine, but I plan on making a few other builds exploring Krawler/Shaddoll, Krawler/Subterror, Krawler/Ghostrick, and Krawler/Ninja, to name a few. Do I believe my build pushes Krawlers to their limit; have I achieved peak Krawling perfection? No, but I hope this list will inspire others to seek this goal with me.<br /><br /><br />Before I get into the card-by-card, I want to explore what Krawlers do well, what they lack, and how we can push them to their limits. Krawlers lack draw power. Their only two in-archetye options to fetch cards are World Legacy Survivor and Krawler Receptor, but both only find one card. You could play Receptor with Book of Taiyou to gaurantee fingin Soma, but I've found Taiyou to be difficult to draw into. Krawler's also have very conditional floating effects that only trigger off of opponent's card effects, and only when the monster is face-up. Finally, Krawlers traditionally&nbsp; represent very little interaction on the opponent's turn. Maybe one or two flip-effects activating to deal with the opponent's summons, and most decks can play through that. To fix the difficulties this deck faces, we are including search cards like Small World and Pot of Desires. We are using Guard Dog and Morphing Jar #2 to provide stronger interruption to the opponent, and several hand-traps to supplement our plays. We are also using Junk Sleep to guarantee activations and to allow us to re-use our flip effects. And we are protecting our mons with cards like Lord of the Heavenly Prison and Calamity Upon the Hidden City. What do Krawlers do well? They float into 2 Krawlers, and have a great variety in their card effects! From Spell/Trap or monster destruction, to dumping any monster from deck to grave, they cover quite a wide spectrum. Also, with the new support in Krawler Soma, this deck can very easily get four monsters on the field with just two cards! If we use the tools this archetype provides to the best of our ability, it can grind an opponent out of resources and win us a war of attrition, if we don't lock the opponent out of the game completely!<br /><br /><br />Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. We're playing 2 Nibiru, The Primal Being to clean up the opponent's board, and because Nibiru doesn't destroy facedowns, of which we have many! (Thanks to <a href=""/author/ide-eyes-21499"" rel=""nofollow"">IDE-eyes</a> for this!) All of our handtraps and once-per-turn cards are at two because we lack draw power in this list, and drawing multiples of these cards is extra painful. We're also on 2 Ash Blossom, 2 Infinite Impermanence, and 2 Dark Ruler for extended games and going second. I put 2 copies of Lord of the Heavenly Prison in to protect our backrow and our set monsters, and the card we will be searching with them is most often either Small World or World Legacy Survivor. The 2 Pot of Desires are our best draw card (prosperity would be better, but the price is killer), and the goal is to use it after searching with Small World or World Legacy Survivor to preserve our bridges and our key cards. The 1 Ghostrick Shot and 1 Ghostrick Scare are here for the extra deck Ghostrick to Utopic Future line. 1 Called by the Grave is crucial to avoid hand-traps. Possibly the most important cards in this list are our 2 copies of Small World (3 is better for consistency, but I found it to brick too many times, and we need all the cards in our hand to be usable). I will go over our bridges at the bottom, but just know that this card is our primary way of finding Soma, and once we have Soma, our primary way of finding Guard Dog or Morphing Jar #2.<br /><br /><br />Now for the fun stuff! The meat of the deck! Our primary card to flip our monsters face up, other than Ghostrick Scare (searched off of Angel of Mischief) is Junk Sleep. It flips all of our monsters, which while not as controlled as a card like World Legacy Pawns, does allow us to activate multiple flip effects on the opponent's turn. It also flips all of our cards face-down during the End Phase, which resets our flip mons and powers up the next card. Calamity Upon the Hidden City! This is a powerful addition to any flip deck, as it protects all face-down monsters from targeted effects. It also floats into any monster when it is destroyed by an opponent's effect, and it gives all monsters that we flip face-up a 1500 point Atk/Def boost! This increase stacks with multiple copies of Calamity, and applies to all monsters we flip up, and given that we will be flipping our monsters face down with Junk Sleep, this can often be enough to push for game. I only included the 1 copy of World Legacy's Mind Meld. It is a fantastic card, but this deck doesn't have reliable ways of putting traps in the grave, unlike the Girsu build which uses Lib to dump a Spell/Trap from deck. We hope to hit it off of World Legacy Survivor, or to use on the opponent's turn as additional disruption. We are playing 2 Guard Dog and 1 Morphing Jar #2 (inspired by <a href=""/author/faith-sc-32392"" rel=""nofollow"">Faith_SC</a>'s list) to stop the opponent's plays on their turn, and buy us enough time to either OTK or setup our board.</p><p>EDIT: now I'm playing Amano-Iwato in place of Morphing Jar #2. It can bridge into Girsu, and can be used to find Guard Dog.<br /><br /><br />We're on 1 Deus X-Krawler, a very powerful boss monster that Skill Drains the opponent's board. You could play 2 copies instead, I just don't want to brick on it. 3 copies of Krawler Soma, as Soma is the key to this deck. This new piece of support is just what the archetype needed! He allows for much faster plays than Krawler was used to, and if Soma is flipped down and back up again, their level resets so they can use their ability again next turn! The small Krawlers (smallers) are 1 Ranvier for recursion, 2 Receptor to search, 3 Glial to summon Deus X or Spine, 1 Axon if the opponent is playing backrow, and 2 Spines to remove monsters. In the extra deck, we are playing 2 Ghostrick Angel of Mischief, 1 Ghostrick Socuteboss, 1 Utopic Future, and 1 Utopic Draco Future as the payoff for this line. 1 Gigantic Spright is here to summon any small Krawler from deck and to extend our bad opens. Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax is a difficut mon for Spright and Tearlament to deal with. Borrelguard Dragon can flip our monsters on the opponent's turn and helps us to push our advantage. Knightmare Unicorn is crucial for dealing with destruction-proof cards. Subterror Behemoth Fiendess can cheat out Deus X-Krawler, or send it to the grave to be revived by Glial, and it searches! The rest of the extra deck is just the X-Krawler link mons.<br /><br /><br />Now that we have the deck profile out of the way, how do you play it and how does it win? Our goal with most starting hands is to draw or find Soma. We can use our Pot, Small World, Survivor, or potentially Receptor to find Soma. If we are going second, he is still crucial, but perhaps more important is finding one or two usable hand-traps to disrupt our opponent and provide and opening that we can sieze. If we started with Soma, or found it without using Small World, our next target for Small World is Guard Dog. Guard Dog locks the opponent out of all special summoning for the rest of the turn after they are flipped, and they are the optimal summon before Soma, most of the time (not against Floowandereeze for example). Morphing Jar #2 is the next best target (it can disrupt Floo), with the base Krawlers being the alternative option. Once we have a monster to normal summon and Soma in hand, we have a few branching choices. If World Legacy Survivor hasn't been used we can make Utopic Draco Future with two set monsters and a Ghostrick Scare set, with 3 remaining cards in hand. Otherwise, making Subterror Behemoth Fiendess with three set monsters or X-Krawler Qualiark with two set monsters is our play. We want the opponent to be forced to make inefficient trades with us, like popping Qualiark which will summon back 2 mons or destroying Guard Dog after it already got it's effect off, so they run themselves out of cards and options. Going second we are looking to clean up as much of the opponent's board as possible before setting up the same Guard Dog lock with other face-down cards and passing. This deck has a hard time winning in one turn, so we want to draw the game out as long as possible.<br /><br /><br />Lord of the Heavenly Prison helps to extend the game. If we can reveal this card, and have an active Calamity on board, the opponent cannot destroy our set cards, and they cannot target our set monsters! Once we activate our face-down, usually Junk Sleep or Ghostrick Scare, we can summon our Lord and search a Spell/Trap (Small World, Dark Ruler, and Pot are all great searches, as they will be banished at the end of our next turn). So, we have options for protecting our cards, stopping the opponent form making plays, and filling the board, and now we need to find lethal. Hopefully we have gotten lucky and found a Calamity. If not, we are going to rely on the X-Krawlers, specifically the attack boosts and combat effects, to push in once we have re-filled our board with Soma. If we have to play a slower game with Avramax or Borrelguard, we just look for chip damage each turn, while preserving our lock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With some of the changes I made, we can also make El Shaddoll Winda with a set Deus X-Krawler on field! If you open Girsu and Soma, normal Girsu sending World Legacy Mind Meld and summon a token. Flip Girsu face-down to summon Soma, use Soma to summon two Krawlers face-up. Link the two flip-monster Krawlers into Shaddoll Construct, and fuse Construct with the face-down Girsu to make El Shaddoll Winda. Link Soma and the token for Lib the World Key Blademaster, and set World Legacy Pawns from deck. On the opponent's turn, use your Mind Meld in GY to summon Deus X-Krawler to a zone Lib points to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Here are the Small World Bridges (they are all reversible):<br /><br />Starter&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Result<br /><br />Any Krawler / Amano-Iwato / Ash Blossom &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard Dog&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; Any Krawler / Amano-Iwato / Ash Blossom<br /><br />Nibiru / Lord of the Heavenly Prison&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Guard Dog / Girsu<br /><br />Any Krawler / Guard Dog / Girsu -&gt; Amano-Iwato&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Nibiru / Lord of the Heavenly Prison</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I really hope this breakdown was helpful; that it was informative and enjoyable! If you have any questions or comments, I would love to hear them in the comments down below! Have a great day!<br /><br /><br />EDITS: Included Sol and Luna, its a great card to draw. Included Girsu and the Shaddoll extra-deck package, which we can make off of Girsu. Swapped out Morphing Jar #2 for Amano-Iwato; they're a better bridge and do more for the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />PS: In the side deck are options that I've considered, but that I can't find a place for right now</p>"

The Xyz monsters are there for:

Gustav Max - Enables OTK given the chance that you have 2 Timelords (Specifically, Michion and Sandaion)

Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity - A way to gain LP (if that's relevant), but mostly used as a monster that has immense ATK/DEF with easy-to-fill requirements (2+ Level 10 Monsters) for a Timelord-oriented Deck.

&nbsp;

<strong>Timelords' Individual Gameplan</strong>

Metaion

<em>Inflict 300 <a title=""Effect damage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Effect_damage"">damage</a> to your opponent for each card returned.</em>

This means that Metaion is handy whenever you want to bounce off the enemy monster field to the hand and inflict decent amount of damage, especially if the field is filled with many monsters.

&nbsp;

Lazion

<em><a title=""Shuffle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shuffle"">Shuffle</a> all cards from the opponent's <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Graveyard"">Graveyard</a> into the <a title=""Main Deck"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Main_Deck"">Deck</a>. Also, <a title=""Once per turn"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Once_per_turn"">once per turn</a>, inflict 1000 damage to the opponent when they <a title=""Draw a card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Draw_a_card"">draw a card</a>.</em>

Lazion is very good against effects or playstyles that interacts with the Graveyard, and also punishes draw-reliant playstyles (?) by inflicting 1000 damage, and up to 2000 before Lazion is returned to the Deck.

&nbsp;

Zaphion

<em>Shuffle all <a title=""Spell Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spell_Card"">Spells</a> and <a title=""Trap Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Trap_Card"">Traps</a> the opponent <a title=""Control"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Control"">controls</a> into the Deck. Also, the player can draw 1 card if it is <a title=""Send"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Send"">sent</a> from the field to the Graveyard.</em>

Zaphion is decent against decks that rely on Continuous Trap/Spell Cards and also keeps the Spell/Trap zones clean from activating those cards.

&nbsp;

Sadion

<em>Make the player's <a title=""LP"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/LP"">LP</a> become 4000, if it is less than 4000.</em>

While this at first seems not to be useful, Sadion can help to at least keep yourself safe from some Direct Attacks when your hand is somehow bricked.

&nbsp;

Kamion

<em>Shuffle 1 card the opponent controls into the Deck, and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent. Neither player can <a title=""Respond"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Respond"">respond</a> to this <a title=""Activate"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Activate"">activation</a>.</em>

Kamion's return effect may not be too useful at first glance, but the fact that it is unreactable and apparently doesn't target makes it powerful to get around effects that prevents cards from getting targeted, and you get to deal some decent chip damage.

&nbsp;

Michion

<em>Halve the opponent's LP.</em>

This very simple effect allows Timelord Decks to effectively OTK the opponent if they have another copy of Michion, Sandaion (2000 damage) or Raphion (Inflict Damage equal to 1 Monster's ATK), then proceed to Xyz Summon Gustav Max to shave off the rest of your opponent's LP. Ideally, it's the first Timelord to get into hand.

&nbsp;

Hailon

<em>Inflict damage to the opponent equal to the difference between the player's LP and theirs, if the player's LP is lower.</em>

While this card don't get much use given the playstyle of Timelords ensuring that you have more LP most of the time, this card has some very good combo with Clashing Souls, where you can create a win-win scenario after paying a heavy amount of LP, and then inflicting the difference of both players' LP.

&nbsp;

Raphion

<em>Inflict damage to the opponent equal to the <a title=""ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/ATK"">ATK</a> of 1 monster this card battled.</em>

This is basically an identical effect to a monster like Yubel, except that you don't need to force the enemy to attack you to deal massive damage. This card is especially great against boss monsters, as most of them have &gt;3000 ATK, Raphion basically punishes the opponent for playing beatstick monsters.

&nbsp;

Gabrion

<em>Shuffle all cards the opponent controls into the Deck, then the opponent draws a card for each card shuffled into the <strong>Main Deck</strong>.</em>

This is basically a board wipe, while the fact that the opponent draws can be a huge setback for this card, it is extremely potent against Extra Deck-reliant playstyles like Synchrons.

&nbsp;

Sandaion

<em>Neither player takes <a title=""Battle damage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_damage"">battle damage</a> from <a title=""Attack"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Attack"">attacks</a> involving this card. At the end of the <a title=""Battle Phase"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_Phase"">Battle Phase</a>, if this card <a title=""Battle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle"">battled</a>: Inflict 2000 damage to your opponent.</em>

Sandaion is an amazing monster since it has 4000 ATK and DEF with a summon condition as easy as Cyber Dragon, this card is notably the only Timelord out of the main 10 ones to have more than 0 ATK and DEF. In which it can be even more dangerous if someone runs Skill Drain or effect negations

&nbsp;

Sephylon

Since you won't be getting 10 Timelord monsters to the GY most of the time, the only reliable way to summon this card is to use Infinite Light's effect. Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord is all in all, a boss monster that just appears to bring in some Timelords with negated effect but 4000 ATK, which can enable an OTK.

&nbsp;
