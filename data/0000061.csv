I tried my best to try and make the deck somewhat close to tier 1 or 2... This deck's win conditions are to use super poly and the pure Sky Striker engine. So, you first summon a Sky Striker ace link monster to your field for their awsome effects, then super poly your opponent's field and fuse into your starving venom or triphyoverutum and go under the link arrow. From there, you can start destroying your opponent's board or link into Pheonix or Unicorn and control... It's all up to you!!! Feel free to comment below your suggestions on this deck."

And after testing this concept on ygopro, the deck I came up with is crazy strong going second and breaks boards really easily. This deck is meant to go second, the way this deck works is that you first use the Muskets to attempt to break their board and you can even use <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> under the same column as a Musket monster to trigger it's effect and get a strong fusion off. If your first attempt with Muskets fail then you that is why you play 2 Crooked Crown and the Shaddoll engine. Because in this current meta everyone is always ending on an extra deck monster, using Shaddoll Fusion going second is so strong. Since Construct is level 8 as well, you can use <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> to take control of your opponent's monster and use another monster you control to go into the new BLS link 3 that is insane and the likely hood of your opponent getting over it is very low unless they are playing Orcust. Also for those of you that are already fans of Magical Musketeers and are wondering why I choose to play 2 Dancing Needle and 2 Crooked Crown its because almost every deck in this format abuses their graveyard and Dancing Needle really hurts, especially against Salad and Orcust. I think for a different format in the future where the graveyard is not as abused Dancing Needle can go to 1 in the deck. The reason for 2 Crooked Crown is because the deck suffers if it loses its normal summon, so you need to be able special summon another Musket monster in order to recover, and the card is a free plus if you activate it under the same column as another Musket monster. I bet you guys are also wondering about <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> as well. You probably think I'm a madman but in reality this card is broken in this deck. The combo is with <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Doc"">Magical Musketeer Doc</a> where you activate Goods under the same column as him and send any Magical Musket Spell or Trap that you want to get back to your hand, and then Doc activates allowing you to add that card from your dump off Goods. This is something I came up with while testing and think its really strong, especially while playing Doc at 3. Also in testing the third Max never comes up for me because the game ends too soon. Even if the third Max comes up in some sort of a long grind game this is why I chose to play 3 Doc and 1 Wild. This deck is also pretty consistent for the most part. I hope you guys enjoy this deck profile and stick around for more cool meta decks that I post :D."

But need 1 minimum  *3 <em>magician navigation</em>: another card where people debate to put 3 or 2 but i say 3 is still better since it's effect is so good and works well with illusion aprentice and super poly(if you have no DM on hand, for discard purpose) and it's grave effect is god tear. i will ofter go search for this intead of ethernal soul, unless i have 1 already.  2 <em>ethernal souls:</em> most people use 3 but i rather just have 2 and use dark magic inheritance as a replacement, i find myself wanting more navigation than soul but with inheritance it gives more option. but you can use 3 instead of inheritance. i just find 2 and 1 works better.</div></blockquote> <strong>Very reccomended but optional:</strong> <blockquote><div><em>*2-3 ash blossom&amp; joyous spring with 2-3 called by the grave</em>: i use 3 and 2 of this combo, it's on what you prefer, if you'd rather protect your searches go for grave but if you prefer to stop ememy plays then go ash, but not that impermanece counters grave and ash can only be used once per turn,  depending on situation and first game, i might remove them and switch for side deck on second game  *some sort of draw engine, 2 draw engine is optimal. i use 3 pot of duality since most of my special summons happen on oponent turns.specially in the early stages. then i also use the spell book engine, 1 of each because i can't manage to remove other cards to run 1 boy and 2 and 2 books, so i just use one of ea. if you have extravagance, it's also a good option but you would need to modifie the extra deck to have more pairs and at that point may wan to remove a super poly or 2  since you won't be able to relly on it as much. i don't recomend pot of desires since to risky  *3 solemn judgment since it counters anything, really strong and destroys all pendulum summon, only counter is supper poly, and onlike strike, if your hp is low, you can still use it.  *1 skill drain: if you have this card it's pretty much gg if you have your DM engine on bord.  also if you use magician rod and illusion magic, you can still use rods effect.  *3 super poly: saves me so many time, but also a good side deck switch option for when you face things like skystriker since its useless, i'd keep 1 just to posible be able to special summon the dark magician dragon with imduk.</div></blockquote> optional card: <blockquote><div>dark magic veil: just a solid good card that allows you to summon from graves or hand, works well if illusion apprentice and dark magician if you have circle on feild.  magician of dark illusion works well but wouldn't use more than 1</div></blockquote> EXTRA DECK <strong>good supper poly targets</strong>: <blockquote><div>*mudragon: for when they don't have dark monsters  *starving venom: goto dark super poly target  *guardragon almarduke: doesn't happen often but if they ever have 3 link on field, it can break their board. specialy if no dark monsters  *predaplant dragostapelia: used if they have a fusion monster and you or him have a dark monster,  *dark magician dragon knight: in rare case if they have a dragon, but more often you will use your dark magician with either imduk or whomeever reprodocus is pointing 2.</div></blockquote> <strong>the 3 xyz monsters are good solid cards to have</strong>  <strong>good link monsters:</strong> <blockquote><div><strong>* </strong>beatcop to protect you ethernal soul, link spider for when you only have 1 darkmagician to circle around with, imduk does the same and is a poly target for you dragon knight but he points to enemy side, so risky sometimes, reproducus for when i only have 1 DM but  multple monster on field so i can turn 1 to dragon and poly with  the DM for dragon knight,(doesn't happen often, mainly use imduk.  *black luster soldier  is really good but to expesive for me but if you have it, use it, its really good with you DM since its 7 star.  *berserker of tenyi: not that great, but is easy to summon with the trap card fists of the unrivaled tenyi trap card. but if you rather have extra imduk just incase, that works 2</div></blockquote> &nbsp;  <strong>My side deck</strong>  this depends on the people deck at you casuals, but i find what i have to be pretty good to counter most decks, i'd say soul drain and summon limit and storming mirrors are very solid picks, and the rest change as you please  &nbsp;  the deck is around 150-200$ (not counting black luster soldier) depending on the rarities you go for.  the expensive cards are (but not really if you compare other type of deck):  apprentice illusion:10-20$ (need 2-3)  magician navigation:10-15$ (need 2-3)  predaplant triphyovertum:5-10$  ebon illusion:10-20$  (luster if you want it: 70-90$)  rest is arroun 1-5$ cards  i won't add side deck since thats more situational  but other good choice would be nibiru and dinowrestler pankrtops  <strong>final notes:</strong>  i tries eye of timaeus but i find it to bricky since you need a DM and you can't search it, you wouldnt want more than 1 or maybe 2 if desperate but it's a dead card, while super poly can be used for multiple different uses.  another fun way is to add 2 dragon keeper and trade 1 super poly for 1 ultra poly so you can search. but as fun as it is , its easy to counter, but its fun."

They can put up to 3 Negates. That is a welcome addition to a deck which already strives going secon,"https://youtu.be/FMVsDHepZWM - Deck in action on youtube (Subscribe perhaps=?)  Card Ratio explanations: <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> - HOPT On summon searches any other fluffal or edge imp sabres. You want to see him as much as possible</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> - Everyone knows about Bear Wings combo. You just have to max out on him</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> - Great card but there is no reason to play more, Muligans your hand (sort of), its board swarm isn't hopt so you can abuse it with Clotheep summoning both Owl &amp;Dog in the same turn. Very good card. Used to be more valuable with Toad and Norder, nowdays just a one off</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a> - Poly searcher on summon or polymerization itself on the field, can search fusion substitute as can any card which searches poly. Ofc you gotta play 1. By playing 1 any card which searches ""Fluffals"" also gives a poly access, super relevant if vendor sacks Dog</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> - A must run, allows you to enter Clotheep / Anaconda super easy. Increases the ammount of fusion resources you have by reviving an edge imp and bouncing a fluffal (Dog  / Owl usually), since you can still fuse with monsters in your hand this card indirectly pluses whenever you do that</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a> - If you fuse with this card you can add back poly. You can Chain mask your key effects such as Frightfur Tiger pop. Not normal summon reliant yet it makes sure you keep fusion summoning which is important for Predaplant Dragostapelia, Sabre Tooth and whatnot</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Fluffal Wing"">Fluffal Wing</a> - Playing 3 is bricky, it works well with performapal - pop up and Dragun of Red-eyes even. If we ever get brill fusion back at 3 I ll play just 1.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Edge imp chain"">Edge imp chain</a> - self searcher on attack so another monster which can increase the number of fusion resources. But he is played for the second effect. whenever he is sent to the graveyard from your hand/field by fusion summon, Performapal pop-up, toy vendor.... he can search a frightfur card.. Hi Patchwork</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Edge imp sabres"">Edge imp sabres </a>- Super searchable as both dog, vendor, and frihgtfur patchwork search it. You kinda don't need more then one for your deck to function not that playing 2 would impact your winrate to much. Combos well with Toy Vendor</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>- So this cards search effect ain't once per turn, somewhat coinflipy but if you do get lucky it puts you so far ahead</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Performapal Pop-Up"">Performapal Pop-Up</a> - a control able card destruction which doesn't make your opponent draw handtraps. Can be vulnerable to ash but there are quite a few cards you wan't to discard in this deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fusion Substitute"">Fusion Substitute</a> - As searchable as polymerization is. The draw 1 effect really helps</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> - So I am running 2 polymerizations and 1 fusion sub. I recently tried 1-1 ratio, or just 2 polymerization ratio. This is what I prefer just slightly over the other 2 ratios and any other ratio would be trash</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Factory"">Frightfur Factory</a> - Continous polymerization altho I kinda don't like this card as I can only fusion Frightfur monsters with it... This card is sort of a must because Edge imp Chain can search it... in case you already cycled patchwork, Frightfur fusion rivals that even less nowdays because it can also be used with Anaconda. One can try running 2x Frightfur fusion instead, but there won't be much winrate diff imo</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur fusion"">Frightfur fusion</a> - fusion which uses grave and field, searchable and it also works with Anaconda.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Foolish burial goods"">Foolish burial goods</a> - this is a card you want to draw the most, even more then patchwork. Sends Vendor but you can also send Fusion sub</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> - better then Pot of Greed in this deck.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Red-eyes fusion"">Red-eyes fusion</a> (Edge imp sabres puts it back in the deck if you draw it)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark magician"">Dark magician</a>  (see above). You need to play him to enter Dragun of Red-eyes off Anaconda which is quite scarry boss monster</li>  	<li>1x Phantazmay - Material for Red-eyes fusion I personaly am not a fan of Phantazmay but its the best target</li>  	<li>2x Ash</li>  	<li>2x Nibiru</li>  	<li>2x Storm</li> </ul> Extra deck <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Frightur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightur Sabre-Tooth</a> - Multiple Sabretooths come up all the time, Don't need 3 due to fusion sub</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> - 2nd Tiger comes up sometimes, its a multi pop card. Sometimes you need multiples</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a> - OTK</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> - Kraken + Sabre-Tooth combo can out double colossus</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a> - Armades effect, honestly not to relevant but sort of a staple. Don't feel like running Instant fusion for it</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Frightfur Dare Devil"">Frightfur Dare Devil</a> - Both Dark and 8. So can cross into both Felgrand and Dragostapelia.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dragun of Red-eyes"">Dragun of Red-eyes</a> - 2 BRICKS are def worth it</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand"">Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand</a> - Better then other r8s because he can detach for fusion sub. Negate</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> - No we don't summon this with super Poly. Negate</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Clotheep"">Clotheep</a> - Reason why I updated this deck</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Predaplant verte Anaconda"">Predaplant verte Anaconda</a> - Reason why I updated this deck</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Borreload"">Borreload</a></li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Unicorn"">Unicorn</a> - Makes sense to run 1 link 3.</li> </ul> Side deck is standard stuff.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The win con is an otk with nightingale and an equip that powers her up enough to 0 ur opponents lp thru her ability to attack directly a number of times equal to the materials attatched to her.

A rule to Kubi Battles, you shouldn't put irrelevant cards in the deck; for example don't put ""Black Whirlwind"" in the deck if there are no Blackwing cards in the deck.

Several other HEROs make an appearance, such as <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> and <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a>. You'll want to try and discard Shadow Mist using the effects of either <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a>, <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a>, Super Polymerization, or send it to the grave by the effect of Vyon or Neos Fusion. Once done so, she lets you search a HERO from your deck, and you'll most likely wanna go for <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a> to power up your other HEROs.  <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Brave Neos"">Elemental HERO Brave Neos</a> also pops up in the Extra Deck, letting you search any Neos-supporting card after destroying an opponent's monster and powering up from any Neo-Spacian or HERO in your grave. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Grand Neos"">Elemental HERO Grand Neos</a>, meanwhile, lets you get rid of your opponent's tools without having to worry about certain ones with non-destruction or graveyard effects. Elemental HERO Divine Neos was kinda added in as an ""if all else fails"" option, and figured would help since <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunriser"">Elemental HERO Sunriser</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> can both help get those effects off."

You aren't impressed by my furry with a fan!?!? But what if I have TwWwoOo furries with a fan?!??!?!??!?!,"Come along! Come along! For I shall present to you the newest weapon of the furry nation! Furries with a fan!!!  Got a Problem with those pesky towers??? No problem, Just summon a windy furry and thew will just blow them away! Revolutionary, I say!!!!  And they cost only 19.99$ Call now or you will miss this fantastic opportunity of annoying the ever-loving shit out of the person your playing against!  Plus if you call now! We will throw in an extra deck full of staples which gives twice the cancer experience! Call under 555-WhyTheFuckAmIDoingThis-725  ( Warning: The windy furries target and are thus bad in every way shape or form from a modern Yugioh perspective! The furry nation isn't liable for not getting rid of  pesky towers! Use with caution! )  ...........  Yea I don't know what that was either.  Its that time of the year again, where I shall upload a new deck to the Yugi community and revolutionize it with BRILLIANT deck choices! The meta shall BOW before me.....Getting off-topic again sorry  SO like always, I'll start this profile with a small story!:  Its the year ...äh 2017 I guess, and little Felix found out about the yosenju archetype! Being in love with Beast warriors before thanks to Lunalight, little Felix decided to give it a look! And little Felix....did not like what he saw.  &nbsp;  Basically Yousenju existed a few years ago out of 3 cards, the 3 Yosenju Karmas. The other few cards were of course, trivial! The rest of the deck at that time consisted of control deck staples, like solemn strike, warning judgment etc you get the drill. So that meant it wasn't really fun to play AND it literally costs a leg and a liver. So as a young naive duellist....I just gave it the ""Its shitty"" stamp.  But ooooh golly, the Yugioh Gods were not pleased with that opinion, so they decided to give the deck so much new support in rising rampage, that it's basically now a whole new archetype!  For example, they got 2 really great new pendulum monsters, the mayosenjus, that can just when they are pendulum summoned, bounce up to 2 cards on the field back to the hand (So btw, they can bounce tenki/ Kaijus and just use them again )  Or another example, they got some decent effect negate and ""battle protection"" in the form of secret move and sword sting. So they aren't so flimsy anymore.  I honestly don't know what to say about this deck, except that it is just an absolute blast to play! It's very spammy which I like a lot and it can compete with a lot of decks, as bouncing to the hand is still really strong even though they target. Don't be like me back then, give Yoseju a chance and annoy your friends and family with it!  &nbsp;  Thank you for supporting my, by clicking on this profile! It really encourages me to upload more decks. If you like the deck, it would be very very sweet of you to leave a like down bellow and I hope you'll read my Next Profile!

Enjoy ^_^,"Well, from some time, I've become a little obsessed about Vendreads. I know that the ""Zombie World"" would be a better choice, but I wana keep the retro style of the deck (since people are already tired of Doomking  :D  ), so I opted for a 2nd best choice, of mixing the deck with Shiranui. A 100% pure Vendread deck would be to weak, since we all know that the archtype by itself lacks consistency.  Ok, so the main purpose is to have your ritual bad boys armed with aditional effects, but remember, your ritual materials MUST BE ON THE FIELD, for they to receive the best additonal effects. That's why Impcantation (the best support for almost all ritual decks) has no sinergy with this deck, cause you need to you use specific materials. That makes the deck a bit tricky. The most common scene is to have a Revendread Slayer ritual summon by using Revenants and Houndhorde as FIELD materials. In this case you'll have a full armed Slayer with 2 Quick effects that will give opponents headache! ^_^. The best scene is to have an Executor ritual summon using Revenants, Houndhorde and Core as FIELD materials. In this scenario, none of your cards can be targeted by opp effects ;).  And ya, as the main counter we have the frightening rock bastard Nibiru, to punish our opp in case he wants to put to many negations or if he wants to Borrelsword us! If we don't use Nibi in this way, it can be also useful, as he's Lv 11, and can be used as entire tribute from hand for all the ritual monsters.  Enough with the words! If you guys enjoy the deck, go play it, and never forget to have fun! ^_^"

And given the support they've gotten this year, nothing made me happier than seeing these bad boys back in style and even crazier than ever. Now, instead of simply one HERO subarchetype reigning a whole deck, all HEROs pop up to make a difference, from all subs and walks of life for one common goal.  The idea of the deck is to go for as quick a satisfying KO as possible by quickly summoning low-level Warrior monsters in the form of HEROs, each with their own outstanding effects and potential, to make way for far more powerful Fusion and Link HEROs. It's not necessarily the ""mandatory"" way to run HEROs, play whatever you want the way you want. It's simply how I personally enjoy running the deck, and you're more than welcome to substitute things for say, Malicious Bane or Infinite Impermanence if your wallet can take it.  One thing you'll want to do right away is special summon <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> by discarding a HERO from your hand, preferrably <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a>, or any of your Miracle Fusion targets. This, in turn, lets you add <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> to your backrow, which you can then activate to tribute Faris and special summon itself to the field, which then lets you bring <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> about. Vyon is vital as he allows you to send other grave-centric HEROs there, as well as banish Faris or any other HERO from there to search for Polymerization.  <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a> is vital as both a way to bring out monsters like Stratos and Shadow Mist to the field and a way to recycle HEROs from the grave if it's sent there by a card like Polymerization. Prime targets include the aforementioned <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> and Shadow Mist, either for HERO searches, backrow popping, or adding <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> to your hand. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a> is also worthwhile given all the extra HEROs on the field you have, being able to take those out to bring itself to the field and let its Skill Drain/Relinquished-esque effects run wild.  Onto the Extra deck, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> requires no introduction, as his ability to lock out important grave-centric cards of your opponent and punish them for searching makes him a must for this deck. That's not to say <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a> doesn't have his place, though, boasting high ATK and being able to both attack directly and search for additional Mask Changes. Meanwhile, cards like <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO"">Destiny HERO</a> - Dangerous are the reasons to run <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>, Dystopia allowing you to do chip damage while Celestial or Decider are in the grave while gaining ATK from either Dread Decimator, Honest Neos, or Dangerous to pop any card your opponent controls, and Dangerous for fodder to send card like Mali and Shadow Mist to the grave.  <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> acts as a free search if a Destiny HERO's in your grave, meanwhile <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver</a> allows you to recycle your Poly's and Mask Changes and <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> powers up any HERO it points to.  By far the absolute boss monster of the deck is none other than <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunriser"">Elemental HERO Sunriser</a>. Requiring generic material to summon, he makes an easy boost to any board of yours, powering up your monsters depending on all the attributes you control and popping a card your opponent controls once a turn when your HERO attacks. Not only that, but he also lets you search <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a>, helping you set up for Omni-HEROs like <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a> to act as a ticking time bomb or <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Great Tornado"">Elemental HERO Great Tornado</a> for weakening powerful tools.  All in all, HEROs make for an optimal OTK tool if played in the right hands, and I sincerely hope you have as much fun with them as I do."

The basic idea is to get the Necrofears on board and either sit on them to win with Destiny Board or use them as rank 8 material. Beat Cop is decent because she immediately puts herself in the grave to be banished for Dark Necrofear and can protect stuff. The main problem I have with this deck is searching because it is super slow and takes about three turns to do anything, and also some Extra Deck suggestions would help."

Possible thanks to Gizmek Yata,"Ever thought 1 Cyber Dragon Infinity per turn is not enough? No Problem! Cyber-Invoked is here.  Thanks to Gizmek Yata you can use your Normal Summon for core, use extenders like Machine Dupe, Galaxy Soldier or Cyber Dragon Nachster to swarm the field and after this make a second normal summon.  Because Cyber Dragons don't need any field spell you can use Magical Meltdown, which allows you to add Aleister direct from the Deck.  Tribute Core for Yata and then use your second Normal Summon for Aleister, who adds Invocation from your deck to your hand . Next you go into Link-Aleister. Now you can use your LV 5 monsters on the board to make Nova--&gt; Infinity. After this, you use Invocation to banish Aleister and a light machine from grave to special Invoked Mechaba to your 2nd linked zone.  &nbsp;"

Now I want to post my going first list because going first muskets is also a really good deck. The goal is to go first, summon a musket and hopefully be able to have in your opening hand, and use <a data-name=""Ties of The Brethren"">Ties of The Brethren</a> to summon 2 other muskets and pass turn and use musket cards in hand to interrupt your opponent and control the game. There's not very much for me to talk about for this deck because there are not many combos or many details I can talk about. All I can really say is <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> is broken. The only broken combo in this deck I came up with is that you can use <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Mastermind Zakiel"">Magical Musketeer Mastermind Zakiel</a> and 2 other monsters to go into the new BLS link 3 and be able to get its effect to become untargetable and indestructible by card effects which is very hard for most decks to get over and most of the time, ends up winning you the game. This deck just got much more powerful since everything else was effected by the banlist but this deck wasn't. I personally believe this version of muskets or the going second build I posted last week is a good meta call for this format. I hope you guys enjoy and stick around for more decks soon, especially post banlist."

The main engine is  built around doppel being pulled back from the grave along with synchro/link combos.  Heavily inspired by Biscuit's deck profile on YouTube."

Why not draw for burn damage? Greed let's you make the latter happen!,"Using the Continuous Trap 'Greed', this deck intends to make your opponent draw a lot of cards, to then let 'Greed' deal damage to your opponent for every card drawn.  This deck is not meant to be used competitively. It's a non-competitive deck meant to just be occasionally played for some fun in a way you may not expect. I personally fought against this deck when first using my Frog the Jam Turbo deck (also uploaded on this site).  To make this deck, or at least a deck surrounding 'Greed' more competitive, I've been recommended to use Dark World and/or Danger cards. Whether I want to make a more competitive version of this deck, I'm not sure."

You want to see as much combo pieces as possible so I really don't want to run less then 3</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Copernicus"">D/D Savant Copernicus</a> - I have seen people run less then 3. THOSE HAVE 0 IDEA what the fk they are doing with D/Ds period. This card is literally an Arma knight of the deck with 5 amazing targets. How MENTAL do you have to be to run less.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Thomas"">D/D Savant Thomas</a> - This card is not an amazing combo piece but it is a combo piece, Usually it is a combo piece for late parts of a combo. I have seen people run more, maybe they don't want to banish it off desires but it ll just brick your hands. RUN 1, Laplace is also Thomas 2.0 I would rather run one of each but I am not even doing that. He is far from a bad card but overated by many. But Maybe I am biased as a Croatian and Tesla fan (No I am not)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Swirl Slime"">D/D Swirl Slime</a> - Everyone runs 3. The best combo piece. This card was semi-limited at one point that says enough</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Necro Slime"">D/D Necro Slime</a> - I could understand people running less then 3 but cards such as Almiraj and Performapal Pop-up really push it to 3.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Lamia"">D/D Lamia</a> - Everyone runs 3. Funny enough I often dump all 3 turn 1 (ofc you can only use 1 it just happens with D/D ghost ;P). Used to be semi limited.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""D/D Ghost"">D/D Ghost</a> - So this card in a nutshell buffs the viability of Necro Slime and Vice Typhoon, because it really fills the graveyard which if you tried playing D/D lately you ll notice is SUPER IMPORTANT. It can also be revived with Clotheep and then you can cross into Fiber since Ghost is a tuner and get Lamia. It works well with most of your combo pieces. I even debated running 2, or running high king Alexander, but it made no sense to go over 40. I went from hating the card to not touching the D/D without it... Ghost wasn't included in some of the replays, I figured running him is optimal via playtesting (An old D/D player)</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""D/D Savant Kepler"">D/D Savant Kepler</a> - Oh yeah... Dark Contract Searcher, so Searches everything. Idk what else to say run 3. Even better in the ocg WITH 2 one for one.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> - Superb card. Here are some card combinations you typically don't want. Kepler + Gate, Necro Slime + Vice Typhoon, Lamia + Copernicus, duplicates.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> (Unless you are in ocg then run 2) - there are like... 3 good targets duh.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""P&lt;a data-name=&quot;ot of desires&quot;&gt;ot of desires&lt;/a&gt;"">P</a><a data-name=""ot of desires"">ot of desires</a> - If you banish thomas / Ghost its fine in most of the cases</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Foolish burial"">Foolish burial</a> - DUHHHHHHHH</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Performapal Pop-Up"">Performapal Pop-Up</a> - there are 13 cards you wan't in the graveyard + the deck can always revive everything from the graveyard.. so you can even dump thomas revive him later put up Titanic. Just be careful with life payment. Remind yourself to turn off your own Contracts with Siegfried etc if needed. It ups the consistency of the deck</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Gate"">Dark Contract with the Gate</a> - A continous Rota</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Swamp King"">Dark Contract with the Swamp King</a> - this card fusions from both hand field and graveyard. If it fuses from hand / field keep in mind it doesn't banish, it sends your cards to the graveyard so it can sort of act like a Swirl Slimes first effect. I would not fault one for playing 2. Its a great card.</li>  	<li>2x Impermanence - so this handtrap can be set.. which is important because you don't want to lose to much lifepoints of performapal Pop-Up</li>  	<li>1x Ghost ogre - There is a needlefiber in the deck... this can put Ogre on the field, ogre works from the field. You can also revive ogre with clotheep, since ghost ogre is a tuner you can also link into fiber get lamia</li>  	<li>1x Ghost ash - best handtrap in a game by a mile, a tuner.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Extra deck: </strong> <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""D/D/D Flame King Genghis"">D/D/D Flame King Genghis</a> (Previously known as Temujin) - You literally need 2 for some combos.... Revive</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Flame High King Genghis"">D/D/D Flame High King Genghis</a> - I feel like sometimes even the second one is required but there is just nooooo space. Reviver, handles backrow decks well going second</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc"">D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc</a>- He is just a level 7 fusion you drop which then you use with lamia to enter the Savage / Siegfried. Sometimes he gets revived off your D/D/D revives so that again you can enter something with Lamia. Win condition against burn decks, can save you from Contracts</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Gust King Alexander"">D/D/D Gust King Alexander</a> - D/D reviver, only revives &lt;=4 monsters just like Clotheep</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a> - Makes your Ragnarok nutz because at that point Ragnaroks revives twice per turn. Normally such play gives you Titanic</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried</a>- Yes, negates are good, A D/D name so can be revived, can even help you heal a bit of LP</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystal wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal wing Synchro Dragon</a> - OUR CRYSTAL DRAGON IS BACK IN D/D &lt;33333</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> - New Addition for D/D decks. Sometimes your ending board is literally 3 level 8 synchros, trust me this isn't to much lvl 8 synchros</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a> - A new card, with Fiber this forces your Opp to discard 1 card. I chose it over Formula, Wonder Magician (don't wanna pop my own contracts), and Shooting Riser Dragon but you can also run any of the 3 without much winrate difference imo.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> - Fk thats a long name, succ the spells, protect the Appolousa..</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>- so this helps you put those Lamias, Necro slimes etc in graveyard. It really buffs such cards</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> - Might get banned... This is the only threat for the future of the deck,  this card is also not to essential, other Link4s aren't much worse</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crystron Needlefiber"">Crystron Needlefiber</a> - will we ever get him??? Atleast the deck is soon OCG legal with 2 OFA</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Clotheep"">Clotheep</a> - whenever a monster is summoned it does stuff depending on the monster types (synchro, xyz, ritual, fusion) it points to. Overall that normaly means you can revive a monster since it ll point to a fusion. You don't have to use this immedieatly as soon as fusion drops, keep in mind it ll keep pointing to that fusion.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Side deck <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Contract with Errors"">Dark Contract with Errors</a> - Ehmm Searchable Royal Decree - Fantastic side going first vs trap decks</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Contract with The Witch"">Dark Contract with The Witch</a> - so this card counters Dark ruler no more. Fantastic side for game 3</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a> - I am not maining him as there is no enough space but, he first turn Kali Yuga is win condition against backrow decks. Going second no backrow deck ll let you reach r8 so he just isn't maindeck worthy in my eyes</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D Orthros"">D/D Orthros</a> - Searchable mst with Dark Contract with the Gate</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Lightning storm"">Lightning storm</a> - More going second backrow hate</li>  	<li>3x Nibiru - some combo hate</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D Evil"">D/D Evil</a> - side it going first against Pendulums, way to searchable not to be in a side deck since you can always access it when you do..</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh"">D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh</a> - a D/D link... idk he can kinda otk with D/D/D Supreme King Kaiser but going first gameplan is ALIVE AGAIN.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Ceasar Ragnarok"">D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Ceasar Ragnarok</a>- another long name.. an out to those can not be targeted monsters, but Cwing and Savage can get big to not to mention that Clotheep can boost atk if it points to synchros so you can out those ""immunity cards"" sort of well already. If you decide to run more Swamps going second strongly consider him. Its a good card space is just tight</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace"">D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace</a> - Ehm Thomas 2.0 in a nutshell, can also out those ""immunity monsters"" with high attack. So if you face such decks why not have this in a side deck</li> </ul> You can also side virus cards, typical going second handtraps etc, just showing some less conventional options which are super accessible so should be strongly considered for a side deck  &nbsp;"

I know that the latest red-eyes support as come out so i decided to try and make a deck out of the new card since it is really good and i mean REALLY good! This is the deck that i found the most success with in terms of making this a pure red-eyes build and i must say the deck actually does pretty well against other decks. the idea for this is to either go first or second(it doesn't really matter but first is prefered) and essentially create a board full of interruptions that your opponent will be forced to play through. normal you do have ask blossom or some kind of hand that will allow you to negate your opponents effects. the deck is not necessarily suppose to stop your opponent rather slow it down so the deck can keep up with your opponents speed. as i was play testing the deck, it use to be just a slash dragon pass deck and maybe with fang with chain on the board. this deck does a similar thing except you summon ""Dragun of Red-eyes"" and then set a trap or two. those traps usually being fang with chain or some other disruption card. yes i know you cant target dragun, but even then your end result should still have at least one or two disruptions since you also have a chance of having ash blossom in your hand as well. pot of desires and allure of darkness are also there to boost the consistency since red-eyes seem to have an issue with it as well. so now the question is, what so i think about the deck so far? well to bee honest the new support is absolutely amazing and is a good first turn board not only providing a big beater for your opponent to get over but also a disruption as well. i think the deck is decent at best. of course the deck is not meta by any means but i do know that this is defiantly a step in the right direction for red-eyes since the deck itself hasn't been getting the respect it deserves. yes the card line up does seem a little awkward, but that doesn't mean it cant be make good by any stretch of the imagination. if you guys have any ideas on what to put in to make this beck better, feel free to comment down below."

Then it turned into a pet project of mine. I’ve fine tuned it and it performed well at locals, obviously it struggled against the top decks like Salamangreats and Orcust but all in all I feel like it did well for it just being a casual deck.  Basically you want to see Rescue Rabbit turn one. If you don’t; Unexpected Dai works as a backdoor opener. Both is even better. You want to do some Electrumite plays, usually targeting Hallohallo, for some synchro plays. If your going first, you want to end with a Apollousa, Dawn Dragster, and Borreload Savage ideally. Sometimes all it can muster is two of the three, which is fine.  If you are going second, which is better with this deck imo, you want to use the Utopia Double package for big damage. Also you could work in a level 8 synchro to augment what little life points your opponent would have left. Otherwise you can cheese number 82 for game.  I like this deck a lot, it really have the versatility to deal with just about any situation. Which is why I side Black-Winged dragon for the occasional burn deck. Obviously it’s not a top tier deck, and it bricks if you draw all vanillas or the “garnet” double or nothing. I’ve experimented with the side cards for a more control based strategy but it’s even more inconsistent. I tried out some Igknights and even took royal magical library for a spin, no dice. If you guys have any suggestions I’d love to hear them. This deck has become my side Yugioh project and I’d love to somehow make it more viable than my Altergeist deck. Which is doubtful but I’m having fun with it."

Tech choices consist of generic fiend cards, like Red Blossom fr","The primary goal of the deck is to end on more than just a Unchained Soul of Rage. I like to strive for Unchained Soul, to link with an opponents monster, which then points to one level 8 D/D/D monster, whether that's Beowulf to blow up spells and traps during my next turn, or Siegfried for a negate. Depending on the hand you could end with even better. This deck gains more and more with each turn that goes by. The deck has three key search cards, being Abomination's Prison, Dark Contract with the Gate, and Dark Spirit's Mastery (can search Unchained Soul of Disaster, and Oblivion King)."

Granted not the most reliable, but very helpful online dueling site. Have had a high success rate for the deck. Gearing up for the next local tournament I attend. Nibiru obviously is a worry, but Rafale can stop it. Mind Control is amazing in the deck. For example you open with 2 fur hire monsters and need a 3rd type to go into folgo. Well mind control takes care of that. I found that the ratio of 2 fire Formation Tenki and 1 ROTA have come in handy many times. I have drawn a hand of all spells and traps but somehow managed to have 1 Tenki and ROTA. Which allowed me to go into a full Fur Hire combo."

Hey, i wanted to update the deck as I have keep it playing it and keep on winning with it. the deck is now updated to fight the pandemic and almost all the meta decks.  the whole deck itselfs recycle with every other card, the dark spirits recover themselves when any big unleashed goes to grave, they are almost the best card in deck still but sarama i think its now the best card as it lets you recover every other spell or trap card! so the whole deck never runs out of cards. Amazing defense at the expense of nothing, with supply squad the opponent will be too worried of either hand trap or the unleashed monsters to destroy them so they can become a +2 easily, forbidden dropplet is an exit for established fields like pendulums or hero, cyberse and almost all the decks that rely on one card, side deck is mostly against anything on the meta, nibiru mostly for spam decks."

The main goal of this deck is to break your opponent's board with the effect of the dangers and generate resources with them and otk with the link monsters with a high atk.  It's important to you go second, so you can stop your opponent in the middle of the combo with nibiru or slowing his combo with veiler, to easily break his board with bigfoot, levianeer, the knightmares or any other link monster available.

For each 100-500 more than 8000 your opponent has just add 1 extra spell counter. They have 9000 from Upstart? 17 (+1 from Tempest Magician =18)  Kinda stally but overall not the hardest thing to pull off!  Citadel and Magical Exemplar are huge staples, Exemplar gets 2 spell counters for each spell played, and with Citadel out if its destroyed they go to Citadel.  You wanna use the very small Spellbook engine In the deck to draw 2 off one normal summon, or 1 special summon if you have the cards you need in your hand already and you summon Prophecy via Magician's Circle."
