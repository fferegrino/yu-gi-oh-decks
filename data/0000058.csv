A list of tech:

Kaijus can overly into level 10s, as well as Sphere Mode in side.

Pathfinder is just a substitute for Ruffian Railcar.

There are two Rank 10 machines in the extra that aren't in the archetype, but you can still overlay them into Liebe. Dyson Sphere is for Avramax and other monsters that can't be traditionally removed.

Limiter removal in the side is mainly for Striker, since surprise in the damage step is a way to make up for the resource disparities in the deck. The floodgates are for going first."

This deck is made to break your opponents board, so you always want to start second. There are three engines in this deck:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Windwitch and synchro summoning</strong>
If you have Ice Bell in your hand, you are able to perform this engine. This is most of the time the first thing you want to do, except when you don’t have at least one of the other two engines in your hand. After special summoning Ice Bell, Glass Bell and Snow Bell, you will be able to summon one of the Clear Wing dragons. Most of the time you will summon Clear Wing Fast Dragon, but there are some situations in which you will summon the other one. After that you will summon the Crystal Wing. The Crystal Wing will also be protected against being destroyed by card effect because you used Snow Bell, which will make it a really powerful monster.</li>
 	<li><strong>Shino ritual summoning</strong>
Summoning shino monster is really easy with this deck, because you have a lot of level 8 cards. With Shinobird Calling, you can also summon a Shino monster by banishing one from your grave. You will use the shino monsters to easily clear out your opponents deck. If you start first turn, you still want to ritual summon one of the two shino monsters. Even though they will return to your hand, they will summon two tokens. Also if you have Power Spot on the field, you can add one shino or ritual card to your hand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spellbook</strong>
You will use this engine to get a lot of draw power (which you do need).</li>
</ol>
The Gadarla cards are also really good, because this will easily help you get rid of your opponents boss monsters. You can re-use them, by returning them to your hand with the effect of Shinobaron."

Não contém Needlefiber por sua demora a chegar que me desanimou quanto a montar estratégias com ele.
Não contém Hand Traps por conta do meu estilo de jogo, acho chato encher o deck com elas.
É preferível começar em primeiro, pois levar negação em normal summon acaba com o turno por muitas vezes.

Indicarei apenas as estratégias com o Blue Impala:

-<strong>Blue Impala</strong>:
--Impala + Nível 4:

---Invocar monstros sincronia de nível 7:

----Samurai Destroyer -&gt; Importante para situações de risco quanto às cartas setadas do oponente ou aos efeitos dos seus monstros e em que o ataque é o suficiente ou se tem um Moon Mirror Shield na mão, também é útil contra decks que destroem monstros por efeito de cards.

----Power Tool Dragon -&gt; Monstro que proporciona certa segurança para o jogo por poder trazer Moon Mirror Shield (protege o monstro equipado) e Raregold Armor (protege outros monstros) à mão, protegendo as demais cartas. Se ele seria destruído, pode-se mandar o Moon Mirror Shield para o grave (que voltará para o deck logo em seguida) e buscá-lo posteriormente pelo efeito do Power Tool Dragon.

-----Interação importante: Interage bem com o Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. Pode-se ativar o efeito do Scarlight, protegendo o Power Tool ao enviar o Moon Mirror pro grave, e então buscar o Moon Mirror novamente.

----Karakuri Shogun MDL 00 ""Burei"" -&gt; Pode invocar um Karakuri do Deck e apenas do deck. Invocando o MDL 248 (tuner 3) é possível invocar o Nirvana High Paladin que pode reduzir pela metade os LP do adversário, porém, é um monstro muito frágil, deve-se ter cuidado. Invocando o MDL 4624 (tuner 1) é possível trazer o Scarlight (para limpar o campo) o Psy-Framelord Omega ou o Crytal Wing (opção melhor do que usar as WindWitch por poder preparar o campo antes com um link)

--Impala + Nível 4 + O-Lion ou Impala x2 + Hamstrat: Invoca o Quariongandrax -&gt; Interessante para limpar campo e grave do oponente. Geralmente é possível na primeira mão, sendo útil quando se começa em segundo

--Impala + duas fichas ou Impala + Hamstrat x2: Invoca o Karakuri MDL 00x Bureibu-&gt; Ótima carta que pode ser invocada também de outras maneiras neste deck. Protege as fichas por não permitir monstros em defesa serem destruídos. É possível usá-lo para banir uma carta e o usar para invocar o  Nirvana High Paladin, caso tenha invocado o MDL 4624 pelo seu efeito.

---Interação importante: É preferível conseguir invocá-lo e mandar um Karakuri MDL 4624 pro grave (para mudar sua posição de batalha com o efeito do MDL 4624) tendo um PSY-Framelord Omega  em campo (que traz o MDL 4624 pro grave novamente), assim, a cada turno, pode-se banir uma carta do oponente.

Impala e O-Lion no grave + Megarraptor na mão: Em situações emergenciais em que só se tenha o mega na mão, pode-se banir o impala para trazer uma ficha, invocar o Megarraptor e tributar a ficha para trazer um mecha pra mão, em seguida banir o O-Lion para invocar esse mecha adicionado. O Mecha adicionado pode ser o Lobo-Corrente. Invocando-o pelo efeito do O-Lion, será ativado seu efeito, invocando uma ficha e o mega vai invocar outra, assim dá pra trazer o Rank 10 Super Dora. Dá também pra trazer um outro nível 4 qualquer para invocar o Exciton e limpar o campo (Já me salvou por várias vezes).

Quanto ao resto é só ir treinando e descobrindo.

Ah! O Clear Wing Fast Dragon é invocado pelas WindWitch. Dá pra trazer ele e zerar o atk de um monstro trazido do extra, negando seus efeitos e em seguida trazer o Crystal Wing.

Tudo interage neste deck, mesmo que pareça estranho. É só ter paciência &lt;3

Mathmech 101:
1. Summon yo' Lv.4's
2 (optional). Synchro Summon yo' Lv.8 Magma
3. Synchro Summon yo' Lv.12 Final Sigma
4. Buff the ever-loving Christ out of Final Sigma.
5. Attack over Every Monster in the Game without worrying about card effects.

While Final Sigma is a very powerful card that can only be targeted by Mathmech's card effects, it still needs just a bit added protection to truly be safe in battle. Thus, the inclusion of Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax and Links such as Binary Sorceress and Decode Talker are introduced.

Firstly, because of Final Sigma's effect only going off in the EMZ, one would think that including Links would hinder the deck's effectiveness. Not quite; if you play your Links and Synchros in a specific way to take up both EMZs, they can work together quite well. Avramax's job is to fill the first EMZ, and redirect all attacks made towards your monsters-namely Final Sigma, to itself, while being immune to being targeted by card effects. This allows Final Sigma to still be targeted by Mathmech cards while allowing Avramax to take the punishment for Final Sigma. With most to all of these enabled, Final Sigma can safely attack over your opponent's monsters without being targeted by battle (though non-target removal cards such as board/zone wipes will still be an issue).

Another thing to note: Link Disciple and Dugares make a very good combo to accelerate the deck. Since Mathmechs are primarily Lv.4s that have great effects in searching each other out, getting Dugares linked with Link Disciple can be extremely beneficial for not only draw support (Dugares draw 2; discard 1, then tribute it to activate Disciple's effect and draw 1, send one to bottom of deck). Also, Link Disciple and Decode Talker are the best for summoning Avramax-no joke.

In summary, Mathmech by itself is very strong, but with added help from Cyberse Links can be turned into a near-unstoppable OTK deck with fantastic draw support.

Addendum: C.O.D.E. stands for:
Cybernetic
Over
Drive
Executable
...god that's so cheesy, lol."

After that you wanna stall out picking your negations while building up a hand with your spells. When you get Haine out is when you want to start going on the offensive as she's the main beefstick in the deck. If you have Verre in hand from the start, then you can bring out Edel instead and use her to build a bigger opening board. The earlier you can get Golem Aruru in hand when you have Verre out is also the better as she's another layer of protection, but she's only useful if you already have at least 1 Witchcrafter out on board.

Contradicting what i've just put in the last paragraph, with your initial special summon if you don't start with Schmietta you can use Genie/Pittore to summon Schmietta and then use her to summon Verre. That nets you either a draw or recycle and a spell search in your grave. This only works if you have the spell fodder in your hand, but seeing as there's plenty spells in the deck then that ""shouldn't"" be an issue.

Foolish Burial lets you dump Schmietta so you can use her spell dump/search effect without having to draw her/use her summon effect (which is useful if you've already summoned your bigger lasses, niche but it happens), you can also use it to dump Genie if you really need to get that extra search off Creation or Revival off Holiday. Can also be used to dump and revive with Holiday. <em>(Took Foolish out of the deck, but will leave this paragraph here just for reference)</em>

Use Foolish Burial Goods to dump any spell you find yourself lacking, but also don't hesitate to use it as discard fodder itself. In fact the only spells you don't really want to discard are the Magician's Hands as they're your main protection. Goods is also useful for searching for your Magician's Hands early on. If you have the resources to spare then it is a good idea to use it to dump Magician's Restage and nab yourself either Left or Right hand, Right hand tends to be the more useful one as Spells tend to be more important than traps to stop early on I find (this of course does differ from deck to deck). And if you're really in a pinch and desperate for draw, say if you've got no monsters in hand and nothing on board, you can use it to dump Metalfoes Fusion and use that to draw.

You don't really wanna go for Extra Deck summons unless you've got Holiday on hand, as losing your Witchcrafters loses you the spell recyclability. So really, put what you find useful in the ED. I personally really like Day-Breaker as using Holiday you can net it another spell counter which gives you more damage and a destro effect, and it being a spellcaster itself means you can use Aruru and Verre to protect/buff it.

Magicians' Soul is a nice bit of draw power (if you can afford it, I can't), you can use it to dump Verre or Haine and then bring em back with Holiday if you have it, and the spells you discard to draw with you'll probably end up getting back anyway. I personally don't like it that much after testing it out but it was only a couple games so who knows.

With the addition of Unveiling bricky hands aren't as scary as before as you can use it to summon anything from your hand, while also protecting your effects with it's own bonus effect."

Cycling through your deck using cards like Rare Value, Crystal Master, Beacon, Bonds and Dante. As the actual CB monsters are not exactly powerful and damage pushing, Heartlandraco helps push through 2-4k of damage while protecting itself. Using these cards you cycle through until you reach Rainbow Dragon with hopefully Advanced Dark and the Pendulum monsters active for a near invincible dragon.

Tempest and Dogman let you go easily into Dracossack, the BLS Link or Big eye for crushing cards or steal a Monster and control the field.

The Dangers themselfe are extenders for Rank 4 and 7 plays, let you dig deeper into your Deck. Also Dogman can compensate the lack of ATK (one main Problem of the Maindeck-Monsters).

If the Board is cleared, you can overlay for Lightning, causing 5000 Damage (often OTK if you have 2 more Harpies or another extra-deck monster on the field).

If your opponent has a full board and a weak Monster in ATK: clear the backrow with Hunting Ground or Dracossack, drop a Feather Storm and overlay for Utopia Double, attacking for Game (Double--&gt;adds Double or Nothing from Deck--&gt;Overlay normal Utopia--&gt;Attack/Negate with the effect of Utopia, then drop Double or Nothing --&gt; GG)"

Lots of LV8 Beatsticks that will be hard to handle for your Opponent. 

Have fun :) ","This Deck is optimized on spamming the Board with LV8- monsters to get into number 97, special number C107 with number 107 as Material through Draglubion's effect and then go for OTK. Otherwise, if you go first, you can do the standart Guarddragon-Combo with Oviraptor to get a board ending up with Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon (grave negation + Board Protect), Number 90 or 38 (monster effect or Spell Negation) and eventually a Solemn or a Handtrap.

At first, i thought building a smaller Deck would be better. The Problem: Bricks (and i'm not talking about the blue-eyes)

You don't wanna draw Carboneddon, Flamvell-Guard, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Dragons Ravine or World Chalice Guarddragon.

So we play 60 cards in this deck. 3 Trade-in, 2 Allure of Darkness, 3 Melody of Awakening Dragon and multiple Dangers gives the Deck enough draw-power. 3 Oviraptor plus 3 Fossil Dig will ensure that you can start your guardragon-combo. Another method is discarding jackalope (melody, his own effect or one for one) to special the 1 copy of mothman. Normal a level 1 tuner and you've got your Ib.

The Dangers themselve are limited to 2 Jacks (specials lv8 from the deck), 1 Nessie (3rd Jack) and 2 Bigfoot, 1 Thunderbird + 1 Mothman as the Targets for Jack. They just enable more LV8-Spam.

The blue-eyes-engine is cutted to save space for generic extenders. The 3 new dragons from Chaos Impact are doing quite a good Job in this Deck. Nebula specials himself and a bricky blue-eyes (or a second copy of himself, Spiral Dragon Bulge) after you summoned your blue-eyes alternative.

Spiral Dragon Bulge is a super target for Trade-in or the melody, though it can activate his effect to special itself if you control 2 or more light/dark dragons in the grave too.  You can also dropp it with the effect of Seyfert to search another LV8 Dragon that's more useful at this moment.

Seyfert is only at 1 because of the fact that we already have 2 good normal summons. Although, Seyfert needs a dragon for cost. You don't alway have that additional dragon, but sometimes it's a good extender. Our main goal is to normal Oviraptor for Guardragon-combo and than go off with our Rank 8 Plays.

Each one of the big chaos-Monsters is only included once. Reason: Each of them has pros and cons.

Levianier: pro: most variable, searchable via melody, needs 3 light/darks in the grave. Sometimes not possible first turn.

Chaos Emperor: Last hope(after errata almost never used), searchable via melody, only needs 2 Monsters in grave, easy LV8 Spam

Black Luster: A random banish that is so easy to get. Sad that you can't search it through melody.

Gizmek Orochi is another good extender. Similar to Spiral Dragon Bulge, you can drop him of with any Kind of effect and special him back through his effect. And he is LV8.

For the LV8-Monster that can't special themselve from grave, you use Return of the Dragon Lords (which is an additional protection as it lays in the grave), World legacy Succesion and the classical Monster Reborn.

Due to the fact that we don't have a searchable counter in here like Zefra or Orcust, we include a playset Solemn Judgement. This makes our Life Points unimportant. Therefore we use one Destrudo as extender.

The limitating factor of this Deck ist the Size of the Extra-Deck. Otherwise you could play an additional Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss as second Agarpain-Target, Black Rose Moonlight and Michael the Arch-Lightsworn as Blue-Eyes Spirit-Dragon Targets (bounce, crush) which you could transform into a Crystal Wing Synchro.

Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star, Divine Dragon Lord Felgrant, Aegaion the sea castrum, Number 23 Lanzelot, Number 68 Sanaphond the Sky Prison and the Galaxy-Eyes Monsters would be also good Additions ( Number 62, Cipher, Cipher Blade, Full Armor Photon e.g. ) for some Situations.

Even the Link-Monster are just a small Lineup due to lack of space. No Borrel-Monsters (BLS as a Replacment), no Triple-Burst, no Linkuriboh or the Knightmares. The Extra-Deck is too tight.

It's important to know that this isn't a meta-wrecker, it's just a really fun deck that works more often than not. If you don't know the archetype, just put as many skull servants (and ""wight"") monsters in the graveyard as you can, and curb stomp whatever your opponent puts in front of the King. You load the graveyard with cards like Gozuki and Foolish Burial, putting in Wightprince first (you can also send him by just summoning Wightprincess), then bring out the King. I don't use an extra deck here, because if I'm running skull servants, I'm running skull servants, but if you prefer an extra deck, cards like Vampire Sucker and Link Spider help, and you can also use Synchro monsters if you use Uni-Zombie. I use Dark Bribe over Solemn because it's cheaper, so if you have Solemns, go ahead and use those."

Pure Thunder is really strong and since I've been playing different variations of Thunder for the longest time, I came up with this awesome Pure Thunder build. This build is actually really consistent. I really like this build because it focuses on going first and you can make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> with a small combo I've put in which is <a data-name=""Glow-up Bulb"">Glow-up Bulb</a> and the spicy <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> target I came up with, <a data-name=""Karbonala Warrior"">Karbonala Warrior</a>. Karbonala is a level 4 Earth monster meaning you can use him and Glow-up Bulb to make Nat Beast. This is obviously an instant win against Sky Striker which is why I put it in. And milling cards from your deck can also be a good thing in this deck allowing more graveyard utility. I've also found that <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> is insane because it kills basically every meta deck out right now. They just pass turn after Dimension Shifter resolves or they continue to play and lose all their resources which is not smart. Another spicy tech I personally like is <a data-name=""Thunderclap Skywolf"">Thunderclap Skywolf</a>. Skywolf is a decent <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> target and is an instant <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> during your opponent's turn while you have <a data-name=""Some Summer Summoner"">Some Summer Summoner</a> on board. Just wait for your opponent to establish combo pieces on board and then right before they're about to make their combo use Summoner to summon Skywolf and there goes your opponent's board. Also the new BLS link monster is crazy and just wrecks most decks because they don't have an out to it. Anyways I hope you guys enjoy and stick around for more!

Six Samurai, Legendary Six Samurai and now the Secret Six Samurai. A new set of Six Samurai monsters has joined the battlefield.
With their ability to protect Six Samurai's from effect destruction, is this the new power of Six Samurais?

I've only dueled with this deck a few times, so I don't have a true feeling for this deck's potential. 'Asceticism of the Six Samurai' is a card I'm considering lowering in the deck. With it, Kageki can give me Doji. Hatsume and Mizuho can Special Summon each other. Outside of that, there's no similar ATK Six Samurais to Summon. It may also be coincidence in these first few duels, but it was a little too hard for me I feel to bring out Shi En or Naturia Beast. I should add I did only see Shien's Dojo once, and the one time I was able to use it it got negated. Shien's Dojo is very helpful in setting up Shi En, I believe that."

While it's not the most consistent in terms of offensive pressure or reliable opening hands, it's still really fun to play and satisfying when you play your combos just right. Not to mention its drawing power is insane, allowing you to get a whole mess of cards played and in your hand in just a single turn. Below are some examples of potential these cards bear for absolute devastation if you know what you're doing.
<h3><strong>Monsters</strong></h3>
<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Light"">Fortune Lady Light</a> may seem insignificant at first, but there's much more to her than meets the eye. Simply by removing her from the field with say, the effect of Future Visions, Past, or Spellbook of Knowledge, she lets you instantly Special Summon a Fortune Lady of your choice from the deck. This can also go off if your opponent, say, activates a card like Dark Hole or Evenly Matched against you. A great way to go about this is to bring out Light while Past is out, activating Past's effect to banish Light and increase the level of a different Fortune Lady, and possibly bringing out Water or Fire in her place. Overall, a truly solid pick for the deck you'd have to be crazy not to run the max of.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Water"">Fortune Lady Water</a> is another core element of the deck that's best run at max. Simply by Special Summoning her to the field while a Fortune Lady with a different name than her is on the field, by the effect of Monster Reborn or Rewind for example, she lets you draw two cards right off the bat. And fortunately, it's not a once-per-turn effect. So try and use Fortune Lady Calling to bring it out whenever you can.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Wind"">Fortune Lady Wind</a> isn't exactly something you want to come across too often, but it's still rather useful as a Normal Summon. She's essentially the Elemental HERO Stratos of Fortune Ladies, letting you pop your opponent's backrow equal to the Fortune Ladies you control, including Wind itself. Essentially if you have a full field of Fortune Ladies, including Every in the Extra Monster Zone, you can wipe your opponent's whole backrow and then the Field Spell. It's best run at one, since you can bring it back with Rewind and shuffle it into the deck for a future backrow destruction.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Fire"">Fortune Lady Fire</a> is another main monster in the deck that's pretty situational, but is still worth merit. Special Summoning in Attack Position her with the effect of Light, Calling, Dark, or Rewind lets you destroy one of your opponent's face-up monsters and deal damage to them equal to its ATK. Try and banish them if they end up in your hand using Past, then bring them back with Rewind for optimal effect. Or use Calling or Light to surprise your opponent when they show up out of nowhere and pop a powerful tool of theirs.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Dark"">Fortune Lady Dark</a> is also run at one, but provides an interesting niche. While she's on the field, when a Fortune Lady including herself destroys an opponent's monster by battle and sends it to the GY, she can Special Summon any Fortune Lady from your own GY, making it easy to bring back Water for more free draws or Fire to instantly take out something your other monsters can't deal with.

Though <a data-name=""Fortune Fairy Hikari"">Fortune Fairy Hikari</a> might seem more like a wannabe Light that'd have no place in a deck like this, her utility can still shine through. Since the deck revolves around drawing here and there, when she's drawn, you get to automatically Special Summon her and activate her effect, tributing a Spellcaster to pump out a Level 1 Spellcaster from your deck. This way, you can easily bring out either Light for a quick field departure into a Special Summon or Past to get your Synchro Summons and banishes off.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Every"">Fortune Lady Every</a> is by far the boss monster of the deck. What's more, when you Synchro Summon her while a Lv. 1 Past is out on the field, you can use both for PSY-Framelord Omega or other higher-leveled Synchro monsters. This may seem like a mindless play, but I include it for one good reason: your opponent is just never finished with Every. While she's in the GY during your opponent's End Phase, you can banish any Spellcaster from your GY to Special Summon her back to the field. And even if Every herself is banished, you can always bring her back with either Rewind or Fortune's Future. But the peril with Every doesn't stop there. During each Standby Phase of yours, when her level goes up by one, she lets you banish any face-up monster your opponent controls, right off the bat.

<a data-name=""Quintet Magician"">Quintet Magician</a> with <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> is pretty much your ""if all else fails"" monster for sticky situations. If he's summoned using five Spellcasters with different names, you get to nuke your opponent's whole field. Not only that, but it also can't be tributed or destroyed by card effects, meaning your opponent's Kaiju monsters or Ghost Ogres, for example, are powerless against it. What's more, you can easily bring back all the Fortune Ladies used to Summon it with Rewind, for more insult to injury.
<h3><strong>Spells/Traps</strong></h3>
<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Calling"">Fortune Lady Calling</a> is a godsend for Fortune Ladies, letting you bring out a Fortune Lady from your deck so long as it has a different name than the Fortune Ladies you currently control. The main cards you'd wanna go for with these are Past, Light, and Water, each for their own complimenting effects.

<a data-name=""Fortune Vision"">Fortune Vision</a> has a good reason for being run at max. The main reason why, and probably most's only reason, is that upon activation, you can search any card with ""Fortune Lady"" in its name. This includes each of your Fortune Lady Monsters, Calling, or Rewind into your hand right from the start. Its other effects are also pretty situational, letting you protect your monsters if your cards are banished or your LP if your opponent's are banished instead. And even if your opponent destroys it, it's no big deal. You can always bring it back with Barricadeborg Blocker for more possible searches.

<a data-name=""Future Visions"">Future Visions</a> looks like a weird play at first glance, but it can actually come in clutch for a variety of reasons. Not only does it let you get the effects of Light and Fortune's Future off nicely, along with Rewind's, but it can also disrupt your opponent's Normal Summons that are vital for certain plays of theirs. Sure, they get the monster back on their next Standby Phase, but you'll likely have already built up a wall against it.

<a data-name=""Fortune's Future"">Fortune's Future</a> lets you return any of your banished Fortune Ladies to the GY to draw two additional cards. Good targets for these include Light, Every, and just about anything your Past banishes to boost or decrease levels. And of course, this combined with Water makes for crazy drawing potential.

<a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a> is another great pick, letting you remove one of your Fortune Ladies to draw two more cards. Light is without a doubt the best target, for the aforementioned Special Summoning, often for Water for yet even more cards. And of course, one of those draws might get you Hikari, which only strengthens your next Summons even more.

<a data-name=""Fortune Lady Rewind"">Fortune Lady Rewind</a> is an excellent tool for these monsters. It lets you Special Summon any of your banished Fortune Ladies, shuffling them back into the deck come the End Phase. This is a great way to surprise your opponent with effects like Fire or Water, Every just when they thought they were finished with her, or just to recycle and refresh cards you've lost. Plus, it's searchable with Fortune Vision."

The prime goal is to summon either dark magician using eternal soul or navigation and/or magician of chaos using ritual spells and the impcantation monsters and combine their power with the dark magic circle and soul eternal to banish and destroy your opponent's game.

With 3 magician's rod, 3 apprentice illusion and 3 circles these cards get decently searchable. I also use upstart goblin and pot of extravagance as I dont rely on the extra deck that much and pot of desires would not be adequate to this deck. There's also monster reborn in case eternal soul's terrible downside makes you lose a powerful monster.

I use timaues even that I am aware of its limitations because the dragon knight protects eternal soul. Youll also find some other handy cards in the extra deck such as big eye and ebon illusion magician.

In the side deck I just added some other archetype cards that I experimented with and that you can use with decent results but I kept out of the main deck in order to maximize consistency."

Using 6 different archtypes, your aim is to fuel the graveyard using Thunder Dragon and Shaddoll (while still gaining momentum with cards like <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""ElShaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>) to summon your big Chaos Boss Monsters (<a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"">Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</a>, and <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonduo"">Thunder Dragonduo</a>). This deck also puts 4 of it's 6 trinities in extra copies of <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> and <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> to more easily turbo out <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> which is a 1 card <a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>, which serves to counter decks that don't have troubles with high ATK monsters but do however have troubles with non-destruction removal and also giving you access to <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> which is generally safer as a turn 1 option going in blind. Supplementary archtypes of Rokket and Danger! are also effective in either giving you another means to reach Beelze or at the very least work through bricky hands. Additional engines starters of <a data-name=""Keeper of Draconic Magic"">Keeper of Draconic Magic</a>, <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a> have also proven successful. (NOTE: It's really fun to Future Fusion revealing <a data-name=""Borreload Furious Dragon"">Borreload Furious Dragon</a> and sending<a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon""> Absorouter Dragon</a> and Brotaur, giving you <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> which is a 1 card Beelze and Brotaur for comeback, adding Levianeer on summon.)

Positives:
-Really hard to stop when the advantage game starts going. It's heartbreaking when your opponent goes -2 to out Beelze and you drop BLS and Levianeer in the next turn.

-You generally can't OTK but you can prey on weaker boards with ease. Summon Baobaboon pass was never so sweet to see.

-It's fun. Quite a subjective point but each time you draw a new hand it seems you are playing a different deck.

&nbsp;

Negatives:

-Boy is it bricky. You are gonna open Assault Beast, Assault Mode Activate and Stardust Dragon Dragon/Assault Mode a lot more than you'd expect in a 60 card deck. Plus there are quite a few hands that don't have synergy, Shaddolls without Fusion, Rokkets without Absrouter. Thankfully Danger! and <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonhawk"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> help you hand sculpt a bit.

-It cannot beat disruption most often than not. It's really hard to deal with trap disruption if you go second. As much as this deck pressures things like Traptrix Altergeist it can't deal with Traptrix Sera and 4 sets most often than not. It's a roll of the die scenario.

-Really weak to non-destruction removal. Sitting on Beelze is fine but a simple Kozmojo or Thousand-Eyes Restrict can make your game plan go down the drain.

With your Dark Magic Circle, Eternal Soul and Magicians Navigation allowing you negations and banishment to your opponent the deck is a underrated rouge strategy. Nibiru and Skill Drain  are  in the deck to help control you opponent. Dark Sacrifice is a perfect card for protecting your Eternal Soul aswell as effectively searching Magicians Rod with its recycle effect while in the GY. Solemn Judgement is a no brainer, its always live whenever you see it and its a summon or Spell/Trap Negate.

Bond Between Teacher And Student is effectively a reverse sages stone, allowing you to summon Dark Magician Girl from anywhere, then allowing you a deck search to set your powerful advantage cards. Dark Burning Magic is without a doubt the best card to search for. Pot Of Extravegance is a must for this deck especially as it doesnt need the Extra Deck. However, due to the price I would also recommend the Spellbook Engine instead.

The Extra Deck is a the basic Dark Magician cards, containing Rank 7 XYZ's, Straving Venom being a Super Polymerization target, although depending on the match up, All your fusion monsters are SP targets. I could not leave my favorite Link Monster out of this deck, Black Luster Soldier- Soldier Of Chaos!. However, the MVP is 100% Beat Cop, Adding its token to Eternal Soul has saved me more times then I can count.

In my side deck are multiple cards i feel have their uses, Palladuim Oracle Mahad is perfect if you are going against a DARK attribute deck. Aswell as Palladium Oracle Mana adds more protection for your spellcasters. Other cards like secret village and epidemic virus can shut down your opponent before they get a chance to combat against your board."

Card choise and ratio Explanations:

<strong>SHIPS </strong>(Only running those who float, Dark Eclipser and Kozmo Dark Planet don't float to the field so they didn't end up on final list)
<ul>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Destroyer"">Dark Destroyer</a> - The best ship which usually self pops, floating down, also a good disruption if a pilot can tag in him during opp turn</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmo Forerunner"">Kozmo Forerunner</a> - One advantage of kozmos is floating. Kozmo ships can steal games by grinding</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmo landwalker"">Kozmo landwalker</a> (level 6) - So he can redirect destruction to kozmotown which in turn makes kozmotown plus but he is just another ship you want to pop while he is inside your hand</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmo Dog Fighter"">Kozmo Dog Fighter</a> (level 6) - Generating tokens isn't bad. We are in link era. Yes I am running 2 level 6 kozmo ships. I just wanted more ship names. Your ships can float from destroyer to forerunner to landwalker to sliprider to wicked witch. Thats a lot of floaty blocks, the second level 6 makes it so that your second cycle of ship destruction is still quite long, but at the end of the day he is just another ship which floats from hand</li>
 	<li>3x <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Sliprider"">Kozmo Sliprider</a></strong> - This ship is important and no not just because he enables infinity plays. Its because he pops fire king island. Fire king island engine helps you pop 3 ships optimally (1 in hand 2 on field). True king engine would help you pop 2 ships (which is why I suggest not playing it)</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Kozmo Delta Shuttle"">Kozmo Delta Shuttle</a> - This ship has the most combo potential alongside the Dark destroyer and Sliprider, He is also level 5 for Cyber dragon nova. His downside is that he can not float into Dark Lady. But again he is 3rd best Kozmo ship floater... I am playing 12 ship floaters in total</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pilots</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmoll  Dark Lady"">Kozmoll Dark Lady</a> - She negetes monster effects (HOPT). Hi Nibiru &lt;3. She is super disruptive specially if she tags out in Slip / Destroyer</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a> - So the Strawman and Soartroopers are the stars of this Kozmo deck, but quite often you won't open the Fire King Island, or Preprep / Disciple. At that point Tincan is needed. Because sometimes all you can do is play standard Kozmo and Tincan is necessary often for that.</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Kozmo Strawman"">Kozmo Strawman</a> - This is the minimal required number of Strawmans for combos to function optimally. So why would you run the third.</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Kozmo Soartroopers"">Kozmo Soartroopers</a> - SoarTrooper is required at 3 for combos you need the third for the last Dark Destroyer float pre Appolousa. Without the third Soartrooper ending board would be weaker (had you chosen third strawman instead). Strawman can also tag out into Soartrooper so he is a bit better draw</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""1x Kozmo Farmgirl"">Kozmo Farmgirl</a>- Its Farmgirl, If you notice that you can generate the advantage via battlephase and Farmgirl do it its worth it.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""1x Kozmo Wickedwitch"">Kozmo Wickedwitch </a>- This card is the final stone of floating. Does this deck need it? Well you don't always float from high level ships. Not a mandatory run tho</li>
 	<li>SIDING - 2x Kozmo GoodWitch - Great at baiting out problematic monsters</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Support cards</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> - a conditional brick you have to run to maximize the power of nephthys and to enter the broken Mannequin cat</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys </a>- He can pop the ships in your hand without conditions so he is not a brick but also not to amazing starter. You always want 1 in your deck</li>
 	<li>1x<a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys""> Rebirth of Nephthys</a> Ehm a ritual spell for nephthys engine. You don't wanna draw this nor the ritual below but PREPREP is broken</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> - Ritual monster for nephthys engine. He special summons Disciple from the deck</li>
 	<li>1x Danger thunderbird! - Searchable with Nephthys link so why wouldn't you run it...</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Fire King High Avatar Garunix"">Fire King High Avatar Garunix</a> - Searchable both with Nephthys link and Fire King engines. Works well with ships so eventho delayed worthy.</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fire King island"">Fire King island</a> - Breakes kozmo ships. Sliprider / kozmotown activating trigger the 2nd effect</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Pre-preparation of rites"">Pre-preparation of rites</a> - This is why you run the 3 bricks. You get 3 god cards in return</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""terraforming"">terraforming</a> - Kozmo town or Island</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Emergency teleport"">Emergency teleport</a> - Ugh summons your pilots (E tele is limited)</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> - Kozmo town or Island. Kozmo town can float from their field to</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> - The deck has some lights so scared to play 3. Synergy with Kozmotown</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Kozmo Town"">Kozmo Town</a> - Triggers the Fire King island. Ups the consistency. searches entire archetype if popped. overall great card</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> - This is how you trigger mannequin cat and why I am glad we didn't lose mermaid</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> - Searchable of Psy-Frame link... This deck has Psychics which banish themselves</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> - A brick you gotta run for Gamma</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Kozmojo"">Kozmojo</a> - Searchable of kozmotown. Outs mystic mine. Triggers ships. Plays around <strong>dark ruler no more</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Extra deck
<ul>
 	<li>Knightmare phoenix, cerberus, mermaid and unicorn - you can naturally enter mermaid with knightmare unicorn ;)</li>
 	<li>Nephthys the Sacred Preserver - Adds both ritual spell from the graveyard (so that nephthyss mosnters can revive themselves) and adds level 8 winged beast from the deck</li>
 	<li>2x Psy-FrameLord Lambda You actually need 2 for the combo. No worry he isn't even bad in this deck you can trigger him</li>
 	<li>1x Appolousa - if she gets banned run the Gryphon, Appolousa is broken tho</li>
 	<li>1x Topologic Bomber Dragon - Triggers ships so I though it would be cute, I don't use it often tho</li>
 	<li>1x <a data-name=""Mannequin cat"">Mannequin cat</a> - 2x Soartroopers (which get sent to graveyard with shuttle then revived with soartroopers) or preprep enter this card. Iblee triggers it you summon the dark destroyer which can float into any kozmo card in your deck</li>
 	<li>1x Leviar - I was also thinking about running Grampulse, Breaksword. Because poping your kozmotown can be beneficial this ended up being the most summoned card</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - Psyframe engine, keep in mind your field is empty while pilots are tagging out, important for GAMMA</li>
 	<li>Number 38 - Siphens the spell, redirects attacks from Appolousa</li>
 	<li>Nova, Infinity - I am not explaining this</li>
</ul>
