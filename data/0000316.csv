Since&nbsp;<strong>Recital Starling</strong> is currently Semi-Limited (and will probably be Unlimited soon), Tri Lyrilusc looks decent, especially with&nbsp;<strong>Tri-Brigade Roar</strong> coming in CYAC.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>. 3<strong> D.D. Crow</strong>. Crow is nice because it is a handtrap and it is a Level 1 Winged Beast which is really nice for Lyrilusc plays if necessary. 3<strong> Tri-Brigade Fraktall</strong>, 2<strong> Tri-Brigade Kerass</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Tri-Brigade&nbsp;</strong><strong>Nervall</strong>. These are basically just here to help you Link climb into Apollousa, but Nerval being a Level 1 Winged Beast synergizes nicely with the&nbsp;Lyrilusc cards. 3<strong> Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler</strong>. It's a good free Summon on an empty board and it can get out another Lyrilusc for free if it is Specialed.&nbsp;3 <strong>Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow</strong>. You can cut it to 2 if you want, but since it basically gives you two Level 1's on the field if you control a Winged Beast, it's pretty nice to open.&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>Lyrilusc - Beryl Canary</strong>. This gives you access to Ensemblue Robin after you are done with your Link plays and it is nice for making Zeus as a follow-up. 3<strong> Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow</strong>. This card searches any Level 1 Winged Beast on Special including itself. 2 <strong>Lyrilusc</strong> <strong>- Celestine Wagtail</strong>. It can search Bird Call on Special for extension or for follow-up and it can give Ensemblue Robin an extra material for another bounce.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>1&nbsp;<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>,&nbsp;3&nbsp;<strong>Lyrilusc - Bird Call</strong> which is so broken, 1&nbsp;<strong>Called by the Grave</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Fire Formation - Tenki</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Tri-Brigade Roar</strong>. If you control any Link monster, you can use Roar to send Shuraig from your Extra Deck to the GY to just search any missing combo piece you need either for extension or follow-up.</span></p><p><span>Extra Deck: 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Number</strong><strong> F0: Utopic Future</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</strong>. You only need to play 2 since that's enough material for F0 and you are never making more than 2 in your starting combo either way. 1<strong> Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</strong> which is as many bounces as it has Material. 1<strong> Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</strong> which is a direct attacker to make Zeus. 1<strong> Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong>, 2<strong> Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</strong> since you can make it turn 3 for removal or you can send it off of Roar, 1<strong> Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller</strong> which can also be replaced with&nbsp;<strong>Hraesvelgr the Desperate Doom Eagle</strong> but Rugal is easier to Summon generically, 1&nbsp;<strong>Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3 Kaijus, 1&nbsp;<strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong> as a Crossout target, 3&nbsp;<strong>Crossout Designator</strong> which you have your targets being Ash, Crow, Nibiru, Droll, and Imperm, 3&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence.</strong></span></p>"

The real glory is to spare it.""","<p>This deck is designed to drain your opponent's LifePoints while holding them back with silly little spells and traps.<br /><br />Basically, the card ""Bad Reaction to Shimochi"" makes it so that each time your opponent were to gain LifePoints, it would be negated, and they would instead LOSE that same amount of LifePoints. Combo this with the card ""Gift Card"" which gives your opponents 3,000 LP. So just by activating 2 ""Gift Card""s while ""Bad Reaction to Shimochi"" is on the field can kill and opponent. This also combos with ""Dark Cure"", as each time your opponent would summon a monster, they gain LP equal to half of its ATK. So just by playing the game, they're losing.<br /><br />Next, you'll want to activate your ""Dark Room of Nightmare"" card. This will make it so that each time your opponent would take damage from a card effect, they take 300 more points of damage. This stacks with every single damage-dealing effect in this deck. This includes ""Mask of Despell"", which equips to an opponents' spell card, and each time their turn starts while that card is in play, they take 500 damage.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a card called ""Coffin Seller"", which deals 300 points of damage each time a monster is sent to their graveyard.

Think this deck is shit? Hit me up @&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/DiceQueenDi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/DiceQueenDi</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a>https://www.twitch.tv/dicequeendi</a></p><h2>Intro</h2><p>Hello! This was my first deck and something I worked out / built all on my own. I actually picked up Yugioh MD only a month ago and only picked Weather Hackers cause it was the first card I pulled and goddamn Rainbow is one hellava waifu. Using this I got into Plat within a couple weeks.</p><p>Anyways. This is called the 'Adventure Kit' as this is the version of the deck splashing the Adventure Token engine. While the Painters don't have a lot of synergy with Adventurers, they both want to do the same thing: set up negates and bounces and completely dick over the enemy. I truly believe that Weather Painters are one of the few archetypes that DON'T need handtraps.</p><h3>I REPEAT: WEATHER PAINTER DECKS DON'T NEED HANDTRAPS.</h3><p>Most of the time you can just completely play through an Ash or a Maxx C (especially since your main deal is double normal summoning with Forecast) since you have SO MANY SEARCHERS in this version of the deck. With the Adventure engine, you have not only an ally looking to do everything you already want to do, but an alternate win condition if your Painters are having difficulty setting up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Strategies and Notes</h2><p><span>Weather Painters:</span>&nbsp;Standard painter plays. Throw out Rainbow on turn 1, Moonbow if you're turn 2 to disrupt boards. You're literally rushing to have your negates and floodgates out and just completely dick over the enemy. If you can set up Skill Drain OR Rainbow you can basically win the game. Note I say or cause while painters can completely swerve around Skill Drain (a required part of the deck), it'll negate Rainbows/Moonbow giving the negate/bounce banish to their painters. Anyways as a standard painter, you just floodgate the enemy, bounce back their bois (since Thundery Canvas is a NON-TARGETING bounce), then beat them down. You can even use your Painters to trigger Torrential Tribute, then trigger their abilities to get them off the board for a free board wipe + canvas effects.</p><p><span>Best turn:</span>&nbsp;Cloudy Canvas -&gt; Snow Painter into Rainbowed Canvas -&gt; trigger Canvas to get Forecast -&gt; Forecast into any weather spell/trap -&gt; Forecast double summon into Cloudy -&gt; Forecast spell/traps into Rainbow/Moonbow -&gt; bring back Cloudy/Rainbow canvas with Cloudy. Next turn you'll have 2 negates on boards, or three if you can summon with Rainbow Canvas.</p><p>You&nbsp;<span>DESPERATELY</span>&nbsp;need Snow Painter in your starting hand. If you're lucky, Piri can help get you into her. Feeling super anxious? Slot in more Piris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Adventurers:</span>&nbsp;Standard adventurer plays. Get out your negate or your double bouncer out with token and literally make the enemy's life a living hell. IMPORTANT NOTE: Weather Painters DESPERATELY needs you to know how to form your board. You want to keep your painters/adventurers on two opposite sides of the field. <strong>As FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE</strong>. If you cross over the lines at all you're going to screw yourself over.</p><p>The best card here aside from Griffon's omni negate is Illegal Knight. Use Illegal Knight to bounce two cards for free (like labyrinth traps :3) then use Dracoback to bounce it back into your hand. BAM. Free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Magician Souls:&nbsp;</span>Consider these your Janitors, your Handymen, your Glue. Magician Souls is an extremely strong tech choice for both painters and adventurers, as you will eventually run into dead cards stuck on your field or in your hand. For example: if you can't draw the Painter monsters, or if your adventurer engine is dead.</p><p><span>Fun Interactions:</span>&nbsp;you can throw out Dracoback for a free re-equip onto the token, or your canvases (with cloudy on the board) to recycle ones you might have lost earlier. Plus! Both Thundery and Magician Souls can send Skill Negate as cost, so you can turn it off whenever you want! If dealing with big mons, or anyone else super unfortunate to put a fat boy on the wrong parts of the field, Magician Souls can turn into Linkuriboh for a stall or Relinquished Anima for a major punish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Lava Golem:</span>&nbsp;Lava Golem gets its own special category as it interacts with both Weather Painters and Adventurers in a savage way. It's not a CRITICAL strategy, but when it appears on the right board you've got a free win with the insanely powerful removal it has. You can also slot in Kaijus or Nibiru, but Lava has a lot more options.</p><p><span>LG Thundery Canvas:</span>&nbsp;wipes 2 mons, then bounce back to hand and wipe two more if you can.</p><p><span>LG Moonbow:</span>&nbsp;bounce Golem every standby, and you have a CONSTANT 1k/turn burn that your opponent can't deal with, since you can chain Moonbow's banish on the damage tick. They can't tribute, can't link it, can't remove or banish it... They have to deal with Moonbow itself.</p><p><span>LG Adventurers:</span>&nbsp;just like Thundery Canvas, but even stronger. Lava Golem 2 mons -&gt; Illegal Knight bouncing Lava Golem + 1 other card + Lava Golem 2 more (even Illegal Knight if you REALLY wanna) for what accounts for a tribute Raigeki. That or, LG, Dracoback, LG, IK for 5 mons if you wanna lose your IK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Links:</span>&nbsp;Topological Bomber Dragon, Borrelsword Dragon, Accesscode Talker, Underworld Goddess, and either Knightmare Phoenix or Cerberus. You have really strong board bounces/wipes so I lean on Phoenix, but go whatever. The rest are tech choices, but I'm personally fond of Kiryu Coco-- I mean Topological Bomber. Remember the Torrential Tribute trick with Painters? Think that but EVERY TURN. If you have Adventure Token on board and are willing to sac your Illegal Knight you can also just interrupt nuke both fields.</p><p>Lyna is here too I guess, but it's mostly here to pull out fodder for TBD, or pull out a dangerous card sitting in your opponent's GY. You COULD maybe swap out 1 Thundery Painter for a Rain Painter and Lyna for Eria then battle sacc it as an alternative way to pull out Water Enchantress... But that'd be stupid... Unless...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>XYZs:</span>&nbsp;You will almost NEVER use these and will most likely just use them as pot fodder. However, they can come in serious clutch if you're in a corner and need to stall by limiting attacks, or just being resistant to getting deleted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Side Deck:</span>&nbsp;this is just filled with cards you can probably just slot into the deck if you'd like. You can get rid of the Adventure package for a more classic deck, but I find removing em for handtraps unnecessary. Also, Cerberus is good for monster removal if you wanna get rid of Phoenix.</p><p><span>Side spells:</span>&nbsp;You also don't really need terraforming since it just pulls out Forecast, which won't necessarily nab you a painter to use it&nbsp;<span>:T</span>. Raigeki/Feather for wipes, Twin Twisters if you find your hand filled with dead cards often. Dark Ruler no more is absolutely boss at the right time, but not necessary since you typically have like 4 omni negates floating around.</p><p><span>Side traps:</span>&nbsp;You can swap out the Torrential Tributes with any combination of these. If you're getting rid of the Adventure package, definitely bring in Anti-Spell Fragrance, as it'll cripple most decks (especially runicks). I don't recommend Rivalry of Warlords unless you're going PURE Painters as it'll just screw you over in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Weather Painters is an extremely strong rogue deck if you're able to set up. Adventurers are really strong if you can't get out the Painters and are looking to stall/work an alternate beatdown win-condition. You will usually not have BOTH online at the same time. Consider it like switching between the two styles as both Weather Painters and Adventurers both contain one-card combo starters.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your most important cards:</span>&nbsp;Snow Painter, Water Enchantress, Rite of Aramesir, Fateful Adventure, Piri Map, and Foolish Burial. That's literally 9/42 cards, or a 21.4% of the deck can start a one-card combo. Again, if you're feeling anxious, slot in a couple more Piri's. You can also eke out Snow with literally any Painter + Cloudy/Rainbowed canvas, or slip into them with Magician Souls or Pot of Prosperity.</p><p>The deck has an extreme amount of consistency, provided you know what you're doing.</p>"

Lightsworn relies on high-rolling pretty heavily, but the simple addition of just one Phantom of Chaos and one Monster Reincarnation is absolutely insane for the deck. It allows you to use basically any effect you want, including Judgement Dragon, as long as you have that card in the GY. This is comes up rather often, especially in the mid / late-game, but if you happen to ditch a JD early on and Normal Summon the Phantom, it can be game-ending. It allows for a second use of basically anything in the deck, from Lumina to gain a board presence back, Ehren to out a sneaky facedown, Chaos Sorcerer to out an annoying card, a Tragoedia for funny plays, or a Card Trooper for quick mills. Otherwise pretty standard.</p>"

month ago,,,0,Branded Bystial Post PHN ( Banish man format ),"<p>Hello everyone this is Lohamora again, with my 2nd, Top 6 decks post photon hypernova, before going to the deck list, make sure to check my first Top 6 deck, which was Witchcrafters ( still feels great to see Witchcrafters consistent ), and now let's get started&nbsp;<br /><br />here are some explanations and notes</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;<strong>Main deck<br /><br /><em>Bystial Lubellion: </em></strong>well the<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>best targets to search with him would be <strong>Bystial Magnamhut </strong>but if you had any other Bystials in your hand, you better search <strong>Bystial Saronir </strong>which helps your combos such as sending <strong>Branded Retribution </strong>to add any branded spell/trap from your GY to your hand or&nbsp;<strong>Branded Regained&nbsp;</strong>which can be placed on spell/trap zone by the effect of <strong>Branded Beast&nbsp;</strong>during the end phase, one last thing I can note here is Placing spell/traps to your spell/trap zones does not means Activating them, so even <strong>Anti-spell Fragrance&nbsp;</strong>can't stop it.<br /><br /><em><strong>Fusion Deployment:&nbsp;</strong></em>I call this card life saver, cuz it's so crazy, especially in this deck, you can reveal <strong>Grand-Guignol</strong> from your extra deck to special summon <strong>Blazing Cartesia&nbsp;</strong>directly from your deck which helps to play around Imperm or effect veiler whenever you ns or ss <strong>Aluber</strong> to search for any branded spell/traps, you can also make <strong>Grand-guignol</strong> with <strong>Cartesia&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Aluber,&nbsp;</strong>I'll take this any of the days.<br /><br /><strong><em>The allure of Darkness + Despian Tragedy:&nbsp;</em></strong>this deck doesn't have that much draw power, so adding allure with tragedy, won't even make this neg 1, that's why I like this card, it also gives you 4 free spots to use your side deck cards, instead of them.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>Branded</strong> <strong>expulsion:</strong></em>&nbsp;I would say the most broken card post photon hypernova, you see summoning your banished <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> during your opponent's turn in their sensitive combo moments is pretty devilish, ah you also don't need to be worried about the discard effect, cuz you get to recycle <strong>Blazing </strong><strong>Cartesia&nbsp;</strong>during the End phase of your turn, as for more information check out the combo lines.<br /><em><strong><br />Tri-brigade Mercourier: </strong></em>I don't know how many of you know this, but <strong>Mercourier</strong> can use its effect even if it's on the field so another good target to special summon it back with<em><strong> branded expulsion&nbsp;<br /><br />Super polymerization:</strong></em>&nbsp; the best board breaker in the game, Graura, and Mudragon are indeed the best targets for this card, Mudragon is great against Kashtira.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>Extra deck&nbsp;<br /></strong><br /><em><strong>Rindburmm the Striking dragon:&nbsp;</strong></em>one of the craziest fusion monsters, which can negate any fusion/synchro/XYZ/link monsters effect then you can return one monster on the field to your hand, this can also negate your own Extra monsters effects, which helps a lot, let's say, you used your own <strong>mirrorjade&nbsp;</strong>then send a fusion monster that lists <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> as its materials as a cost, to banish one monster on the field, you can use <strong>Rindburmm</strong> to negate your own <strong>mirror jade</strong>, and there you go you still have an unused Mirrorjade effect, and a Search effect during the end phase, if you send <strong>Albion the branded dragon</strong>, but wait this card does more than that, Let's say, your opponent used <strong>Dark ruler no more </strong>after the effect resolves you can tribute your <strong>Rindburmm </strong>with <strong>Branded expulsion</strong> to ss your banished <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>, then use Albaz to fusion summon by using your opponent's monster, after that you can <strong>Rindburmm</strong> effect in the GY, to banish the <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> you just used for fusion summoning, to revive back the <strong>Rindburmm,&nbsp;</strong>and there you go, <strong>Dark ruler no more </strong>didn't do anything special, now how to make this card, well with branded fusion, just send <strong>Tri-brigade mercourier</strong> with <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>, then Banish your <strong>Tri-brigade mercourier</strong> with the Effect of any Bystial monsters, to search for any monster card that lists <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>, which in this case it's <strong>Blazing Cartesia</strong> but if you had any other ways to ss her like with the effect of <strong>Fusion deployment</strong>, you can add <strong>Albion the Shrouded dragon,&nbsp;</strong>use it to send <strong>Branded regained</strong> to place it on the field with the effect of <strong>Branded Beast&nbsp;</strong>or to send <strong>Branded retirbution</strong> or <strong>Branded in white</strong>, which combo you prefer to be honest.<br /><br /><em><strong>Grand-Guignol the Dusk Dragon:&nbsp;</strong></em>again another crazy fusion monster, which can be made with <strong>Blazing Cartesia</strong> and any light or dark monsters, this card is like a combo completer, well there are 2 main combos with this card, the first one is to send <strong>Albion the branded dragon</strong> to set <strong>branded</strong> <strong>expulsion</strong> from your deck, and your end board will be: <strong>Rindburmm + Grand-Guignol + Bystial lubellion + branded regained + branded beast + branded</strong> <strong>expulsion</strong>, which by far it's maximum 5 interruptions, and the second one is sending both <strong>Branded retribution</strong> and <strong>branded in white</strong> to the GY, by the help of <strong>Bystial Saronir</strong> and <strong>Albion the shrouded dragon</strong> and in this case <strong>grand-guignol</strong> can send any of your missing peace, let's say you send <strong>Branded retribution</strong> to the GY with <strong>Bystial Saronir</strong> effect, in this case you will Send <strong>Albion the shrouded dragon</strong> to the GY, with <strong>grand-guidnol</strong> effect, then use <strong>Albion the shrouded dragon</strong>, to send <strong>Branded in white</strong>, then use <strong>Retribution</strong> to add <strong>branded in white</strong> from your GY, then your end board is going to be: <strong>Rindburmm + Grand-guignol + branded beast + Bystial lubellion + Mirrorjade + Branded in Red</strong>, which is by far 7 interruptions, but the second combo can't happen all the time, just like first combo, but when it happens, your dear opponent goes R.I.P ( lmao ), but wait there is still more, if a monster is special summoned by the your opponent activated monster effect, you can banish this card from you GY or field to ss a dogmatika monster from your deck or a despian monster from your extra deck, which in post photon hypernova we have 2 targets <strong>Despian</strong> <strong>Quaerities</strong> or <strong>Despain Proskenion</strong>, you decide which one to use, i chose the <strong>Quaerities</strong>.</p><hr /><p><strong>Side deck&nbsp;<br /><br />Book of the eclipse: </strong>This card is broken in the decks and can get rid of face-down monsters, before the end phase like Branded Bystial - Exosister - Kashtira - etc..., It is also the best counter for annoying pure Kashtira deck.<br /><br /><strong>Triple tasking and Triple Talents:&nbsp;</strong>the best cards for going first after losing game 1, they are surely helpful<br /><br /><strong>Lava golem:&nbsp;</strong>I'm not saying we don't normal summon in this deck, but sometimes, we don't even normal summon, again you decide if you want to play lava golem or Kashtira Fenrir, ( Fenrir just has a conflict with Bystial cards sometimes )</p><hr /><p><br />HOW TO SIDE IN THIS DECK ??<br />&nbsp;this is how I do cut all 3 allure of darkness + 1 Despain tragedy + 1 Fusion deployment + 1 super poly + 1 Bystial Magnamhut or Ad libitum of Despia ( depending on the deck you are facing against ) and at some points, you can even cut branded in white and branded retributions if you are good with the first combo line which I explained in Grand-Guidnol section, here you got 9 side deck space.</p><hr /><p>Thank you, guys, for reading, also this was Branded Bystial deck POST PHOTON HYPERNOVE, this deck will get way better again, once we get&nbsp; new cards in CYBER STORM ACCEL, be honest I didn't expect a happy ending, I'm glad lore didn't end up sad ( <em><strong>Stigmatika forever</strong></em> )<br /><br />Well see you guys in my next top 6 decks post photon

Between Sapphire Pegasus, Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon, and the new support from the structure deck, this deck takes advantage of a frankly unbelievable advantage engine that ends on a board of Bagooska, Necrovalley (or Zombie World), and some backrow. The end goal is to floodgate your opponent out of the game with Bagooska and your field spell of choice while keeping your opponent off of monsters using Crystal Conclave.</p><p>The Extra Deck is a highly-customizable toolbox with few absolute essentials outside of Bagooska and Abyss Dweller, allowing this deck to use and abuse Pot of Extravagance very easily. Outside of the two aforementioned monsters, the deck easily takes advantage of the R4NK toolbox, as well as many generic Links such as the Knightmares. Explosive game-enders such as Borrelsword Dragon (i.e. Accesscode Talker at home) and the Numeron Dragon package are just the cherry on top.&nbsp;</p>"

The idea is similar to pizza's deck except your first goal is always to get out heatsoul, because his draw power helps you set up rituals and fusions. Beyond getting heatsoul out, you can go into either the crusadia or marincess path combos turn 1 or the following turn. Once you have everything set up and you are comfortable with your board presence, you can play some flood gates to keep the board state relatively unchanged. The deck also features lots of stun traps to delay your opponent as you increase your board presence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For some of the main combos, you can refer to Pizza's list, but besides that I'm hoping this version of the deck allows for stronger end boards that you can easily rebuild and recycle without feeling underwhelmed by the deck's power output.</p>"

Agido is just mill power, it can make the resources of the deck easier to run out. For Kelbek, it has a great 2nd effect.<br />If you want more hand traps, you can remove Kashtira Fenrir, called, Nat vein, or Orange light.&nbsp;<br />For side deck you can make your own, but that's side deck for my local.

Here's the quik card-by-card:</p><p>MAIN DECK MONSTERS:</p><p>Magicians' Souls is the best starter in the deck. Getting Master Plan in your GY is step 1 of your mission, and this is the best way to get her there. It's on field effect is also great for draw power. You're almost always getting at least 1 draw from sending Big Red, and in the best case scenario you're sending up to 2 of your SPYRAL Mission cards to the GY to set up their effects and draw 2.</p><p>Quik-Fix is your main searcher, and ideally what you want to use your normal summon on. It's search effect is a soft once-per-turn (I'll be saying that a lot in this guide) that allows to add any SPYRAL GEAR card and activates on both normal and special summon. Your ideal search target is Big Red, the archetypical Premature Burial, so we can use it to revive Master Plan and start using her search effects ASAP and link both of them off for Double Helix. You can also search out Drone and Last Resort. He also has a GY effect which allows us to discard a card (not really a downside in this deck) to revive it and trigger its effect again in the same turn if Super Agent (or Double Helix) is on the field, but banishes when it leaves the field (but there's a way around that we'll get to later). We would be playing 3 Quik-Fix if we could.</p><p>Master Plan is our other searcher. She has a non once-per-turn ignition effect that allows you to search for a SPYRAL MISSION card: Either the spell, SPYRAL MISSION Assault, or the trap, SPYRAL MISSION Rescue, which both have powerful effects that activate in the GY. She also has a hard once-per-turn effect that searches for any SPYRAL monster AND the field spell when she is sent from the field to the GY. 2 is standard because she's bricky, an ideally you want to send her from deck to GY.</p><p>Drone allows you to stack the top 3 cards of your opponents deck on normal or special summon, which is crucial for making sure the effects of Double Helix and Super Agent resolve. Ideally you want to search it with the field spell: Resort, or with Master Plan's hard once-per-turn search, then special summon it from the hand by discarding Assault and banishing Assault from the GY. Its 2 other effects are only occasionally useful. 1 Drone is necessary, but personally I think 2 feels right. Builds that play Machine Duplication will opt to play 3.</p><p>Super Agent is a free special summon of the hand if you can successfully name the card type of the top card of your opponents deck. Ideally you want to trigger this effect after Drone so you aren't blind guessing. Having Super Agent on board is important because of Quik-Fix's GY effect, but since Double Helix's name is treated as Super Agent while on the field, it's not the end of the world if you can't stick him on board. 1 is necessary, but some people play up to 3.</p><p>Sleeper is your main deck boss monster. He must be special summoned by banishing 3 SPYRAL cards from your GY. He's a 2800 body that can pop 1 of your SPYRAL cards (we can get around this) in order to pop 2 of your opponents cards during either players turn. Sleeper is not a necessary inclusion and can be a bit bricky, but I think he's worth the risk.</p><p>Last Resort is a monster that equips itself to a SPYRAL monster to give it destruction protection, and targeting protection from your opponent. This card is meant to be played with Sleeper. Sleeper can target the monster Last Resort is eqipped to (usually itself) to pop 2 of your opponents cards with no drawback. Last Resort is a 1-of, and is only good when paired with Sleeper.</p><p>We're playing a small Danger engine of 2 Jackalope and 3 Tsuchinoko. 4 reasons why: draw power, link climbing, putting our SPYRAL Mission cards/a bricky Master Plan in the GY, and they are excellent Small World bridges.</p><p>MAIN DECK SPELLS/TRAPS:</p><p>Small World is the search spell of choice. Where Arf Thou used to be the standard way of searching Magicians' Souls/Quik-Fix, but I find Small World to be the far superior choice. This deck has fantastic bridges. If you plan on trying this deck out, I advise you to take the upload the .ydk to the Small World Deck Optimizer and familliarize yourself with the bridges. 3 copies are necessary.</p><p>SPYRAL Resort is an incredible field spell. It gives your SPYRAL monsters targeting protection, and searches a monster on a soft once-per-turn. 3 copies are necessary.</p><p>SPYRAL Mission: Assault special summons a monster from the hand. One is necessary to get your plays going.</p><p>SPYRAL Mission: Rescue is one of the most important cards in the deck. It revives a SPYRAL monster by banishing itself from the GY. This is the card that will allow you to keep extending your plays until you have a full board. You need 3.</p><p>The above 2 cards are ALWAYS meant to be going from your hand to the GY. They are useless on field.</p><p>Chicken Game plays SO nicely with this deck. Because Resort is so searchable and Magicians' Souls can send it to the GY to draw a card, there are a multitude of ways to get it off the board. Chicken Game not necessary, but I think the consistency boost is worth the risk.</p><p>One For One is great. It's one of the best ways to summon Quik-Fix or Drone from the deck and set up follow-ups and to send an unwanted Master Plan from hand to GY.</p><p>Monster Reborn is the universal extender.</p><p>I think the rest of the cards in the Main Deck are pretty self explanitory. 1 Terraforming, 2 Ash Blossom, 2 Maxx ""C"", 2 Called by the Grave. Don't even think about cutting Ash and Maxx ""C"", you need them as Small World bridges.</p><p>EXTRA DECK:</p><p>Double Helix is the only archetype specific Extra Deck monster. It must be made using 2 SPYRAL monsters. Ideally you want to use Drone to stack your opponents deck before using the effect, since you're required to correctly call the card type of the top card of your opponent's deck on order to summon a monster from your deck. Usually you'll be using this to summon a Master Plan or Quik-Fix so you can start cycling their effects. It's very important that you leave this card on board until you're done cycling through your Quik-Fix's because you need a card that treats its name as ""Super Agent"" on board to activate Quik-Fix's GY effect.</p><p>Sylvan Princessprite is the sole non-link monster in our Extra Deck. You'll want to make this card with a SPYRAL Quik-Fix that has already used its GY effect to revive itself once. At this point, Quik-Fix would banish itself if it left the field, but Sylvan Princessprite allows us to dodge this by detatching Quik-Fix for cost and place it back in the GY for an extra use. The effect itself isn't hugely important, but it does pay off occasionally.</p><p>The Knightmare monsters are very important in this deck, not just because of their generic usefulness, but because they discard your SPYRAL: Mission cards to the GY to allow for follow ups. Barricadeborg Blocker is good for the same reason.</p><p>The rest is pretty standard link-spam goodstuff.</p><p>Curious can be used to send any card to the GY, most likely Master Plan or a SPYRAL Mission card. If you're making Curious, you're likely using some combination of Linkuriboh, Magicians' Souls, Jackalope and Tsuchinoko. Selene can be made with Master Plan and/or magicians souls for an easy Link-4 with the proper setup. Tri-Gate Wizard is our omni-negate. We can make a 3-4 material Apollousa quite consistently. Accesscode and Underworld Goddess are what we use to clear boards going second. I:P Masquerena and Linkuriboh do what the usually do. Saryuja is pretty win-more but it's cool when it pops-off.</p><p>OTHER TECH OPTIONS:</p><p>Historically, Machine Duplication has been a pretty powerful tech option in this deck. While Machine Duplication is certainly not as good as it was when Quik-Fix was unlimited, it can still be a pretty explosive card, allowing you to summon 1 additional Quik-Fix from the deck, or putting 2 extra copies of Drone on the board for link plays. Obviously you want to play 3 coplies of Drone if you choose to play Machine Duplication. Personally I'm not a fan because it can lead to a lot of bricky hands due to the overall lack of Machines in the deck.</p><p>The Winged-Beast engine is a pretty popular choice. By playing&nbsp; Lyrilusc - Recital Starling as your Rank 1 and Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty in your Extra Deck, as well as D.D. Crow and Mist Valley Apex Avian in your Main Deck, You can summon Apex Avian during your End Phase for an omni-negate on your opponents turn, while grabbing yourself a D.D Crow in the process. This also gives you the option of playing the incredibly oppressive Harpie's Feather Storm, which can negate monster effects if you have a Winged-Beast monster on the field.</p><p>Knightmare Gryphon is another powerful Link-4 this deck can play. Like the other Knightmares, you can use Gryphon to send your SPYRAL Mission cards to the GY in order to trigger their effects. Its effect can be used to set any trap card sent to the GY with Curious: The most popular choices include Anti-Spell Fragrance, Appointer of the Red Lotus, and the aforementioned Harpie's Feather Storm. Gryphon pairs particularly well with the Winged-Beast package.</p><p>You can play a copy of Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon in your Extra Deck and Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion in your Main Deck for Synchro plays. Borreload Savage Dragon is the most popular option due to its incredible omni-negate.</p><p>If you choose to play any of the above Main Deck Packages, I advise you to cut Sleeper and Last Resort, since they are the brickiest cards in the main package, and arguably the least important.</p><p>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax is one of the most difficult to deal with boss monsters in the game with its great battle protection and targeting immunity. It becomes even nastier if you can bring it out on your opponents turn with I:P Masquerena for additional destruction protection.</p><p>I didn't have space for it above, but Firewall Dragon is always a good option with it's generic bounce effect. It will always be co-linked to Tri-Gate Wizard at the very least.</p><p>Proxy Dragon is the best Link-2 you can play if you want to U-Link with this deck. It's L/R arrows are great and it's incredibly generic, requiring only 2 monsters. The protection effect can be occasionally useful, I've used it to pop Tri-Gate Wizard in order to protect my Apollousa on multiple occasions.</p><p>Card Destruction isn't bad in this deck. Obvously it activates the discard effects of Jackalope and Tsuchinoko, as well as putting your SPYRAL Mission cards in the GY, but it can also be used to take the 'Maxx ""C"" Challenge'. For those unfamilliar, the Maxx ""C"" Challenge is when you special summon enough monsters in one turn to make your opponent draw more than half of their deck, then resolve Card Destruction to make them discard their entire hand and draw the same number of cards, instantly decking them out, resulting in an FTK. Going first against a 40 card deck, this is done by special summoning 18 times after Maxx ""C"" resolves, something that SPYRALS are certainly capable of doing under the right circumstances. It's gimmicky and I wouldn't recommend it, but it's an option.</p><p>And of course, you can always cut cards like Chicken Game for extra interruptions and hand traps.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>The last thing I want to say about this deck: BE MINDFUL OF THE TIMER. This deck is infamous for its incredibly long combos, and even though I can play the deck at a reasonable speed, I will often pass turn with less than 30 seconds remaining on the clock, and I've timed out/been forced to pass on a sub-optimal board many times. Keep in mind that your time doesn't increase until the end of your opponents turn, so you will need to manage that small amount of time well when the clock passes back over to you.</p><p>Have fun!</p>"

Effectively cut off from most of it's combo lines, PUNK has been reduced to a shell of it's former self. The current cards that counter Tearlaments and Spright also happen to counter PUNK as well, since PUNK use the graveyard as well leaving them vulnerable to Ishizu GY-shufflers and anti-GY floodgates like Necrovalley. </p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</p><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">Losing its two MVPs and countered by common meta techs, PUNK can only turn to incorporate other archetypes and enablers to pack a competitive punch and thus I present to you - PUNK Bystial!<br /><br />On top of PUNK's regular gameplan of drawing multiple cards and summoning Synchro boss monsters, Bystial adds free bodies (more level 6s and 8s to sync with!) on board, more resources in hand (Branded Regained/Magnumhut), additional interruptions (Branded Beast/anti-GY) and a way to counter those pesky Tearlaments that dominate the metagame! <br /><br />Surprisingly, with the anti-GY powerhouse that Bystial provides combined with the draw power and synchro shenanigans that PUNK enables create a surprisingly competent deck - a partnership able to combat the strongest this ""Tear 0"" meta has to offer! </div><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Lubellion + Psy-Frame Gear Gamma (summoned with Emergency Teleport) are also perfect for making Baronne!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Vs. decks like Floowandereeze that don't use Light/Dark monsters and don't need monsters in the GY, just side out your entire Bystial package for the anti-Floo cards in your side deck. </li><li class=""MsoNormal"">A prime discard target for PUNK Foxy Tune is Bystial Saronir. Sending Saronir to the GY turns on your entire Bystial engine since Saronir is a foolish burial for it's archetype. </li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Bystials break boards very easily. Discarding Lubellion -&gt; Druiswurm, then summing Lubellion from the GY removes 1 monster on the field and give you a 2500 beatstick on field, without your normal summon. Try all of these actions to bait out negates, interruption and floodgates before comboing off with your PUNKs! </li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><span class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1 ContentPasted9""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

They think they're +1 for free but they're really not)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Worst match ups...</p><p>T1-Decks you can beat them often but not as often as you'd like. They're too consistent and 1 card can turn the game in their favor. Trust me... they have A LOT&nbsp; of cards that fit that criteria but you shouldn't just auto surrender. I've beat Despia, Sword Soul, Plunder Patrol &amp; the like plenty of times but it's not easy. Not easy at all. it's like you're starting with 5 card's &amp; they're starting with 15. but you can beat them if you're creative/lucky enough.</p><p>*Banish decks (Flow, Metaphys and the like) Auto F6. don't waste your time unless you top deck MST or Harpie to kill the macro or dimension shifter. If they use the banish hand trap, F6.</p><p>*Pendulms- Pendulums don't use the grave yard, don't let them go 1st (F6) unless you have 2 or more of these: Ash,Veiler, Imperm or Maxx ""C"".</p><p>if you go 1st you should be fine majority of the time; Assuming you don't brick or misplay your assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Game Plan:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going 1st:</p><p>1. Bait the hand trap(s) - use Nunu or Nauya's search effect to Ash check. They better Ash this or its basically a free win for you if they dont have ash at all. If you get Called by or DD Crow'd you can't do a full set up turn 1 (very bad against tier 1 decks. Other non meta/rogue decks, you should live.)</p><p>2. If you got Ashed, then Special Summon Nunu from grave yard (GY). If not, send Zohah to GY. Use Zohah's effect to add it to your hand and send anything with more than 4 stars to the GY or Sinister Serpent (Will be called SS from now on). If you have Nauya, use its search for Zohah (Keurse if you have Zohah or Nunu already in hand = Free win) If you have a snake rain that resolves, you'd better orgasm because that a Free win x 5.</p><p>3. Normal Summon Zohah and XYZ summon into King of Feral Imps for next hand trap check. it doesn't matter if they negate the search effect (you don't want Nunu banished when it leaves the field so you detach it as xyz material). If they didn't Negate the search effect, this can mean 3 things:</p><p>*They know the decks actual choke points (extremely bad!!!)</p><p>*They don't have anymore handtrap(s) = free win&nbsp;</p><p>* They are unfamilliar with the deck = free win</p><p>4. If, Feral Imp King gets negated, fret not, you saved your resources from getting banished and can recycle the same play next turn.</p><p>Your well-placed hand traps should hold you down with your feral imp in defense mode. BUT... before you do this, you need to check your grave yard for the following:</p><p>1...Keurse</p><p>&amp;</p><p>2... Nauya</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>if these two are in the GY, you don't have to end turn; keep going.</p><p>5. Tribute Feral Imp King &amp; summon Keurse from GY (WARNING SERIOUS CHOKE POINT). DO NOT special summon keurse unless you're CERTAIN you can bring out Nauya. If not it's a brick it could spell the end for you. if they special summon what every they wan't from the GY, it doesnt matter since its effects are negated, you need to bring out Nauya from your GY. Once Nauya is summoned to your field, you search for either Water Lilly or Serpent Strike.</p><p>6. If you already have the queen in the GY, dont get Water Lilly. Get Serpent Strike, Send Keurse to the GY to summon Zohah but don't activate its effect. Now you should have nothing but 2 level 4's on the field. Zohah and Nauya. If you couldn't get feral Imp out earlier, you can get it out now. If you did &amp; sent it to GY for Keurse no worries, tribute summon queen from GY using Zohah &amp; Nauya as materials. Nauya should be banished by Keurse's effect but you can recycle cards from the banished area some what with Aelirtt's effect. you don't want to have to do this though it can back fire if you have to use him to get you key cards unbanished like Zohah constantly. Don't banish too much &amp; try not to get banished too much.</p><p>7. Ogdoadic Queen should be on the field &amp; you should be activating Zohah's effect.</p><p>8. Add Ogdoadice king to your hand then send it to grave yard. If your oppent is a dummy, he'll discard a monster card in which you can do 1 or both of these:</p><p>1... Special Summon King from GY for free.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>2... Send Ogdoadic Over lord to the GY for free if you chose Serpent Strike over Water Lilly. If you chose Water Lilly, no worries. Queen will summon Zohah from GY next turn when your opponent searches and discards a card. if he doesn't king will make him discard anyway so you opponent can lose card advantage really easily with these two on the field. If they out your queen, you cant summon Zohah from grave but you can -1 their hand off a search with king which can be clutch 7/10 times. If they out your king, then just summon him back when they discard to grave using queen. if they don't out one or the other its GG's. If they summon from rave while queen is up you can send anything from their field to GY. That's huge!!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8. If a monster is sent from the field to the grave, you search or recycle your King of Imps with King's effect. Use, king &amp; queen's effect to sabotage your oppenent while you set up your own GY for next turn. If done correctly, they'll surrender or have spotty board that really fickle. If you have hand traps like a Maxx ""C"", they'll definitely surrender.</p><p>9. Let's say sheet went south &amp; you need to draw the out. That's where the clean up crew comes in. You can use queen to over lord from GY if he's there or search Water lilly with Keurse combo next turn to send him from deck &amp; summon him that way. then he gets out, he wipes all monsters on the field that didn't come from the GY. its a hard once per summon so you'll have to send him back to the GY if you can end the game after his effect went off. if he cleared the field; you should have king (2500) queen (2700) &amp; overlord (3100) to One-Turn-Kill (8300 atk dmg).</p><p>10. If not, you're problably up against a T1 Deck. In that case, you're gonna need Aleirtt and the other monsters from your extra deck. Most Games you shouldn't have to do this, but Yu-Gi-Oh just wants to keep making super consistent decks that pull plays out of their butt from no where. So here we go,</p><p>you're problably going to lose to time trying to recover the materials needed to build your board back after a few rounds of trades so don't be too upset. Yu-GI-Oh hates reptiles so just be happy you can at least compete with a T1 deck. If you enough time to get a board up, i'll leave the extra deck options to your imagination. Use the extra deck monsters i've recommended in a creative manner &amp; you will come out of top 6-7/10 match ups in master duel provided you didn't lose to a time out!</p><p>ENJOY!!!</p>"

Use Tallyho in the GY detching a material from redoer to add back to the hand.</p><p>The end result is a sargas pop, a champion sargas pop and a redoer interruption with Golganda. If you live through your opponents turn 1, you have branded fusion and tallyho for your follow up plays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Thoughts</h2><h3>Pros</h3><p>The deck looks really fun. If you're a fan of the yoinky sploinky, detaching and reatching cards from the GY to your monsters to speical and search is incredibly silly and incredibly fun. It's a deck that could only exist in Yu-Gi-Oh, and I love it for it. There's also a ton of narrative meat on these cards, If you like the Albaz story, the deck will be fun to pilo.</p><p>Additionally, having in engine ways to search Albaz is incredibly funny, and very good going second. Super poly is a heck of a card, and although the extra deck is very tight, there's space to be found for cards like <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11765832"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11765832.jpg"" data-card=""11765832"" data-name=""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life"">Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</span></a> or <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11321089"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11321089.jpg"" data-card=""11321089"" data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</span></a> if you have them.</p><p>Finally, there's a lot of potential here. This by no means is the optimal list, there's ratios to look into and tweak. If you have acess to the bystial monsters, that could be an effective hand trap engine when cards like <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=32756828"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/32756828.jpg"" data-card=""32756828"" data-name=""Branded Beast"">Branded Beast</span></a> are searchable, and the extra deck is pretty customisable as well, with <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=65741786"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65741786.jpg"" data-card=""65741786"" data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</span></a> into <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=38342335"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/38342335.jpg"" data-card=""38342335"" data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</span></a> or even <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=4280258"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4280258.jpg"" data-card=""4280258"" data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</span></a> being possibilities.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p>The main problems I see with the deck is how soft it is to disruption. Dimension shifter will basically stop your turn, and lots of those types of effects are in vogue right now due to the ubiquity of tearlament. Ash blossom and imperm also pretty much end your turn litterally whenever they're activated since all our searches are choke points, unless we get lucky and have exactly what we were missing.</p><p>Additionally, it's not difficult to lock yourself out of half of your extra deck. Branded Fusion is fairly of awkward since you can only summon fusion monsters the turn you activate it. If Albaz himself isn't in rotation, you're going to have to commit to the fusion lines. Since the fusions are the strongest monsters in the deck, it's not necessarily bad, it's just something you have to bear in mind if you open or search branded fusion. Activating Golganda will become muscle memory and can lose you te game if you needed to go into mirrowjade or something to clear.</p><p>Finally, it's still Springans. you'll notice the lack of combo lines I've written up for if you don't open Golganda. Although it's litterally 1 in 4 cards in your deck, there will still be games where you don't see it, and there will be games where you open two golganda, two booty and a terraforming. You will just lose those ones. It's bricky, and unless you have $100 for a playset of prosperity, there's not much you can do about that.</p><p>I think this will be a fun and relatively skill testing casual deck. But I don't expect it to be the best way to play Branded. It might not even be the best way to play Springans given that the champion can search Therion's to set up a negate, but unless you have the money to poney up for two cpoies of that card, this wil have to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Basically, just enough to get the mills from them without any of the extra parts that makes them good. By getting any 2 of the 3 tears, you can summon kitkallos, sending Kashtira, getting the extra mill 2 if you didn't send it yet, then use kitkallos' second effect to pop it and bring back kashtira, getting an additional mill 8. The trap is mainly a way to search Scheiren, allow an additional way to mill the Exchange fairies or just to get an addition mill 3.<br /><br />Exchange of the Spirit: Pretty straightforward. This deck's main goal is to mass mill your entire deck to the grave, Ishizu's fairies let you do just that.<br /><br />Naturia: Send Tree, Search Camellia. Summon Cam, Send Tree, Search Hydrangea. SS Hydra, Synch for 9 (Power Tool Braver Dragon) This acts a a Level 9 Synchro Dragon that plays with the deck. Also, you can later add Blessing to your hand in an attempt to make Cloudcastle, bringing back Braver to Xyz into Aggregator, sending Garuru for an addition draw or Kit for the mill if you weren't able to get into the tearlaments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dark Magician: Basic Magicians' Soul Package, with how many Spells and Traps in our deck, with a vast majority of them wanting to be sent to the Grave, Souls lets us get draws while setting up draws or combos later on in the turn.<br /><br />Bamboo Sword: Brave can equip them from the Deck OR Grave, so if you end up sending a few to the grave pre-Braver, you can always shuffle back your goldens and maybe a cursed with the fairies. Can also be sent to gy by Souls after being equipped with Braver, and since braver gets two cursed equipped off his effect (1 directly and 1 with true)<br /><br />Runick: Ok so this engine can act as your main ""Plan B"", disruption (if going second), or even just play builds. With all the self-milling, it isn't hard to get 3 Runicks to send back with Fountain (which I only recently realized, like the idiot that I am, ISN""T hard once per turn, in case anyone else didn't fully read the card XD) You can run the standard package (3 Curses, 3 Fire, 1 Destruction, 3 Tips) but I was trying to test this so I ended up using a more Going first friendly version. (1 Disspelling, 3 Slumber, 3 Droplets, 3 Tips) as they don't require your opponent to have anything (Disspelling can be used off of Droplets)<br /><br />Other Options:&nbsp;<br /><br />Dark Factory of Mass Production: Adds milled copies of ""The Forbidden One""<br /><br />Tearlaments Merrli: Replacement for Kashtira, Can be added and SS by Kat, or be sent to Fusion into Rulkallos/Dragostapellia<br /><br />Diviner of the Heralds: Sends Agido/Kelbek<br /><br />Extra-Foolish Burial: Sends Kit directly<br /><br />Gale Dogra: Sends Kit and Garuru</p>"

I could practice and improve the build in EDOPro but I don't want to because it's ugly, (sorry), and this deck is all about the aesthetic and not really the function. So far it seems like it's not really a deck that can brick, especially on opening hand, but it also does not really have a win condition yet because it lacks more essential cards like Tearlaments Rulkallos, Perlereino, Icejades Kosmochlor, Rahn, Aegirine, and Cenote Enion Cradle.

You now have a monster with 4k attack that can't be targeted by card effects.</p><p>Normal summon Goldenhair, and link her away into Salamangreat Almiraj. Then activate Goldenhair's graveyard effect and discard a Plunder Patroll monster to special summon her to the field, then link her away to get Blackbeard on the field.</p><p>Summon Buzzsaw Shark and activate it's effect special summoning Right-Hand shark to your field. If you don't have Buzzsaw Shark you can normal summon and activate Beautunful Princess' effect to special summon Buzzsaw shark, to then activate it's effect. You can then XYZ summon Number 4: Stealth Kragen, or Bahamut Shark. Number 4 can once per turn pop a monster on your opponent's field as a quick effect, dealing half of the monster's attack in damage to your opponent. This is a quick effect. And with Bahamut Shark you just get out Toadally Awesome. Because you special summoned the monster with Right-Hand Shark, the monster can't be destroyed by battle.
