Then at this point you will need to make a decision based on if you went first or second. if you went first link into kiskil then summon from the grave the other live twin to then link into lilla to then activate her effect summoning back kiskil (the link monster) to then draw a card. if you went second do what i just said but with the other twins. But the end effect will be to destroy a card on the field. then i would either link those two into unchained abomination and see if you have a unchained trap in hand to set it then end then activate abomination to pop it or to pop an opponents card. All the trap cards have primary effects that do different things but they all have similar secondary effects. these effects allows you to summon an unchained monster from the hand, deck or grave if the trap gets destroyed by card effect. This also counts for your own cards destroying them. This is the main strategies for the unchained monsters. Ive added to the deck some XYZ coverage with Numbers 97, 107 and 38 all rank 8. these can be summoned by the two level 8 monsters in the deck which are: <h4 class=""engine-dark-box"">Abominable Unchained Soul</h4> and <h4 class=""engine-dark-box"">Unchained Soul of Disaster.</h4> If you are going to XYZ summon then i would go into number 97 as he can summon (by its effect) one of the other rank 8 monsters by attaching the other to it as an XYZ material. In this deck you need to play lots of interruptions such as ash to stop your effects being negated and to stop your opponent making unstoppable boards with lots of negates.  That's all you really need to know but that's not the only combos you can do with it but I feel like you need to find some out on your own. One more thing I've play tested this deck out many times on nexus and went 5:0 with this deck on there so I know its competitive and is a very strong rouge deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You use Supernaturalist effect in order to add Necrovalley Throne (or Imperial Tombs if you already have Throne in hand) in EP. Next turn you just use Throne to add Gravekeeper's Headman, and use Headman's effect in order to summon Spiritualist again. You can now summon another Supernaturalist or link summon Verte Anaconda, in order to get Dragoon or Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, using SuperPoly.  I added Malefic Stardust Dragon cause it protects Necrovalley, and you can use it to summon Anaconda. Double Summon is also for Anaconda. If you have Recruiter on the field you can summon Artemis, triggering its effect. So you can add Commandant (in case you don't have Necrovalley on the field) or Spiritualist. Summon Black Rose Dragon (with Ash) if you want to clean the field. There's no Royal Tribute cause it's good only if you draw it in turn one imho, but you can add it in Side. SuperPolys and Storming Mirror Force in Side are for Dragoon.  I think this is the best Gravekeeper's deck ever built. Even if it's still a really slow-paced deck, it's a good antimeta, and it's also pretty simple to play."

Use the extra normal summon of Dark Beckoning Beast immediately to summon the card you just searched, and activate the card effect to special summon either Hamon Lord of Striking Thunder or Raviel Lord of Phantasms from your hand or deck.  Repeat this strategy as much as possible, and: <ul>  	<li>Activate Awakening of the Sacred Beasts as soon as possible so you can begin to accumulate life points when your opponent special summons. Try to get all three face up on field because they all activate.</li>  	<li>Establish two Lord cards on the field with the above trap card to establish trap and spell negation.</li>  	<li>Use Cerulean Skyfire as soon as possible when you have Hamon on the field to establish spell or trap negation.</li>  	<li>Banish Chaos Summoning Beast from your grave as early as possible to get Fallen Paradise from deck to hand and activate that after you have a lord card on field for it to become your Pot of Greed every turn.</li>  	<li>Use Terraforming to preferably search Mound of the Bound Creator mid to late game since you can search Fallen Paradise</li>  	<li>Use Field Barrier to lock in your field spell after you have cleared any opponent field spell with Mystical Space Typhoon</li>  	<li>Use Uria Lord of Searing Flames for Fusion Summon of Armatyle only</li>  	<li>Don't forget to use the token effect of Raviel</li>  	<li>Use Shimmering Scraper (Raviel) to grant your real Raviel 8000 attack and multiple attacks to clear your opponents board</li>  	<li>Don't fusion summon Armatyle without Dimension Fusion Destruction, otherwise he won't gain the effect of not taking battle damage (protecting your life points), and make sure you have Mound of the Bound activated at this point in the game.

You can use golden lord to send circle or combination to the graveyard to summon it back to the field! The main goal of the Dark magician engine is to boost out Dragoon. Magician's souls also synergizes very well with eldlich. The Dark Magicians can also be used to set Eldlich traps to the field!! You can also use Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord, Accesscode, Black Luster or even Dragoon to OTK the opponent. A typical end board should be Dragoon, Golden lord and a bunch of backrow. Overall a very fun deck to play and can also win duels! Have fun!! Suggestions in the comments."

If you have any suggestions, criticism, or praise lemme know down below!  Starting to get back into Yugioh after a good hiatus, and wanted to start fresh with one of my favorite archetypes.  UPDATE 1/31/21: I nixed Borreload Savage Dragon and replaced it with the new link 5 monster Underworld Goddess of the Closed World since having monsters on the field is no issue, plus linking away your opponent's monster (especially a link-2 hit) is highly favorable, and easier overall to summon vs. savage dragon.  I also changed some sideboard cards after playtesting.  UPDATE 3/25/21: I changed around the side deck as well as adding Zeus to the mix in place of Sunsaga.  For some reason one of my side deck cards isn't showing up on the site here.  The last card in my side deck is Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon."

Oh, and some other cards too that you probably don't need, but makes a Red-Eyes player feel good.","This deck is mostly for personal reference. I'm addicted to making deck lists to pass the time. Help me.  I would've labeled this deck as a fun/ casual deck, but the inclusion of Dark Dragoon makes that description null. Even so, it is not the most optimal Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon deck, as you can obviously tell from the deck list. My goal was to make a for-fun Red-Eyes Black Dragon archetype deck, sticking as closely to the archetype as possible, and using only cards that I actually owned, instead of the hypothetical deck lists posted to the site. This is why Cards of the Red Stone and Allure of Darkness are at 2x instead of 3x (I only own 2 of each), and why I don't have Upstart Goblin, Raigeki (I instead use Dark Hole as a pretend-Raigeki since it doesn't affect Dark Dragoon, and it keeps the deck in-line with the ""Dark"" theme), Harpie's Feather Duster, Pot of Desires, or Cosmic Cyclone. It's also why Dragoon is at 1 instead of 3, because I'm not spending 80-100$ on two more copies.  I understand a lot of these cards are unnecessary. Dark Dragoon is the win condition, but I wanted to have a fun deck that allowed for strategies outside the honestly brain-dead strategy of ""draw or search for Red-Eyes Fusion, profit"". That's why I have kinky-byo to let me summon Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, to further make use of my level 1 monsters, Claw of Hermos to let me summon Red-Eyes Black Sword, and why I have 3 copies of the Darkness Metal link monster that I'll never ever summon (I consider those cards my deck cheerleaders). Staying inside the boundaries of an archetype gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling."

The Fossil Fusions are used to create beaters in the grind game or to make a material on the field for linking. A 2 card combo would be Miracle Rupture and Adamancipator Signs.

The trade-off is you lose 2 Apollousa negates, but with the amount of monster negates running around, losing this doesn't really matter (besides, a two mat Apollousa isn't that great anyway)  The new line is to use Elpy and Pisty to make Dillingerous dragon, then use Dill and the monster summoned off Pisty (or whatever other monster you have, but try to keep Rokket Tracer alive otherwise you can't make Savage) to make Rusty. This gets Dill into the graveyard which can then be resurrected to make Verte Anaconda off Rokket Tracer's effect."

Would appreciate any helpful comments.,"Trif's original deck profile ran 3 of ""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"", but recently I found that it would often brick in my hands, and even if I started with it, it usually wasn't even protected when it had those 4 spell counters on it, so I replaced 2 of them with Jester Confits. Additionally: Magister and Mythical Institution often became bricks in my hand, and running Desires at 3 was a disaster when I'd have multiple copies in my starting hand, so I took out one of each and added in 1 Black Fang Magician and 2 Purple Poisons. Since this added a lot more DARK monsters to my deck, I replaced ""Into the Void"" with 1 ""Allure of Darkness"", because I didn't like the discard effect of the former.  For the extra deck, I changed it so often that I don't remember exactly what was in Trif's original? I think it had 3 Selene? I replaced 1 of them with a Thousand-Eyes Restrict which I would sometimes use in place of Millennium-Eyes whenever I played Instant Fusion, depending on my situation (though it would usually still be Millennium-Eyes more often than not). In place of Appollousa I added 1 Abyss Dweller because of all the L4 Monsters I added in and because even when I would set up a fairly decent board with a good handful of negates, the sheer the amount of floating effects from some of these meta-decks I've been facing are still able to play through the negates and then still overwhelm me.  Anyways I'm still a novice when it comes to pendulums and deck building in general, if you guys know any cards I should switch out for better combos/consistency, please do tell me. Thanks."

The engine is 2 Seiyaryu (easily searchable, play 2 as backup), 3 Rayel (add Bellfire/Nativity), 3 Bellfire (add Seiyaryu/Rayel), 3 Nativity (add/ss Seiyaryu from hand). So, basically this Seiyaryu turbo needs <strong>Nativity+1 LIGHT fairy</strong>. Some Holy Night card we could play for recovery is Flamel (recur Seiyaryu from GY, niche battle disruption) and Advent (recur from GY/ss Seiyaryu from hand).  Since Nativity needs LIGHT fairy fodder, it makes sense to play the LIGHT fairy good stuff. Diviner is 1 card VFD by sending Trias Hierarchia, use Trias tribute Diviner, use Diviner ss Valkyrie Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, make VFD. Artifact is good too since they're impactful fairies and also Nativity shuffles back the fairies, it means we don't have to run multiple copies of garnet. Eva is there as we can summon it through Diviner and it gives us Herald of The Orange Light with its effect online. We are able to run Extravagance as we dont need many extra deck monster to play.  The recursion line depends on several cards only, like Trias (it wont banish itself if used in VFD), Holy Night Flamel/Advent, and Eva. We don't run another lv7 LIGHT dragon as they're all bad cards and we need fairy fodder for Nativity, not dragon.  Pros: Unique playstyle with strong lock like VFD/Scythe.

Let me explain it in steps.  1: Summon bahamut  2: Summon nightmare shark with bahamut's effect  3: Overlay into full armor black ray lancer  4: Use xyz remora  5: then spam the heck out of more bahamuts and overlay into FO using the bahamuts after you summon toadally awesomes  You should have about 3 negates at normal but if you have chain summoning make that 4."

Next if you get a starter card xyz into melffy of the forest played at 2 in extra and use the cards effect to add a melffy monster spell or trap from deck to your hand. I recommend melffy tag if you don't already have it in your hand or a monster like puppie if you dont have it all ready or the trap which gives u some interruption on your opponent. Then youse your melffy which you should have in hand either by adding it with melffy of the forest effect or by having it already in hand to special summon any melffy from grave which you should have because of the detaching of the unit from melffy of the forest. Then you can only do this next step if you used obedience schooled as your starter or you haven't normal summoned for turn. normal a second starter/extender or any melffy monster from hand to xyz again into a card appropriate for the situation either going first or second. If your going first I would go into joyous melffys and just stool out. By the way you really want to go second with this deck. If you are going second I say you should wipe the opponents board by using Alpha,  the master of beasts but remember to leave some monsters on your side and also its not a once per turn effect. Also i recomend attacking in some way with an xyz monster at some point in your first turn to make Divine arsenal. then just youse you melffys effects from hand and field at end phases and on the field any time you think you need to disrupt your opponent. The small combo i would youse is if your opponent summons a monster that can be destroyed by card effect and its causing you a real problem then use puppies effect from field to bounce itself back to hand to summon Kalantosa  which will destroy it when special summoned. That's really about it I feel like if you want to use this deck you need to come up with some off your own combos with it its more fun that way. Have fun with the deck and tell me how it goes on Instagram which is lukepastone :)"
