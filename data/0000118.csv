<span><span><span>Welcome </span></span><span><span>all </span></span><span><span>lost souls to the </span></span><span><span>D</span></span><span><span>eck </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>ox of the </span></span><span><span>D</span></span><span><span>ammed, with a </span></span><span><span>ghoulish list courtesy of the twisted mind of </span></span><span><span>Jazzy_Sue. </span></span><span><span>This list of spectres and </span></span><span><span>skeletons</span></span><span><span> is so terrifying that your opponent won’t stand a ghost of a chance. I myself have suffered horrifying defeats at the hands of this list, and as such decided that I’d put out a guide for the Halloween season. This list brings you all the terror </span></span><span><span>of the monstrous Mayakashi archetype, a collection of spirits based on Japanese yōkai. These spirits are in perpetual conflict with the demon-hunting Shiranui archetype, however they have agreed to put aside their conflict for th</span></span><span><span>e sake of this list. Aside from them we also have a variety of zombie favourites and tech choices to bring you all the terror of Halloween right from the comfort of your own haunt. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>2. Deck-list and Tech Choices</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><u><b>Main-deck Mayakashi and Miscellaneous Zombies</b></u></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We begin with the deck’s hyper-extender and the primary set-up tool of the Mayakashi archetype. Dakki is a real force to be reckoned with; </span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>s long as your starting hand has Dakki or one of the many ways to find her you are pretty much guaranteed to climb through all of the Mayakashi synchros and some of the links as well. This is due to Dakki’s effect laughing in the face of popular interruptions such as Nibiru or Infinite Impermanence, thanks to it being a Trigger Effect that activate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> in the graveyard. The one downside to Dakki is her permanent xeno-lock effect: as long as her effect activates you will be locked into Mayakshi extra deck monsters for the rest of the turn, </span></span><span><span><i>even if she leaves the field.</i></span></span><span><span> We run this at </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span> to boost the consistency of the deck’s most resilient hand (</span></span><span><span>m</span></span><span><span>entioned at length in the Combo Guide) but </span></span><span><span>running two</span></span><span><span> is acceptable if you’re tight on main-deck space.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Hajun functions as the deck’s primary starter next to Glow-Up Bloom, searching either Dakki or Yuki-Musume on summon. It should be noted that the effect triggers on any sort of summon, so One for One is a direct 4th copy of Hajun. Along with Mayakashi Return this boosts the consistency of opening Hajun or a way to search it to </span></span><span><span><b>58%</b></span></span><span><span>, a respectable average for any starter. It should again be mentioned that Hajun xeno-locks you into Mayakashi extra deck monsters, although unlike Dakki as long as you can link-off Hajun the effect is not continuous. We play </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span> copies of Hajun here for consistency of our main combo, but you can experiment with less if you’d like to try other starters. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>As the last of the main deck Mayakashi </span></span><span><span>m</span></span><span><span>onsters, Yuki-Musume fills the final role as an advantage generator. It functions as a once-per-turn </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>urial for any zombie monster as long as it’s in your hand or graveyard and you control a Mayakashi monster. Since this lets you foolish any zombie we can preform lines with Glow-Up Bloom if we drew Zombie World or lines with Necroworld Banshee if we did not. Both of those option leave us with full Mayakashi combo plus at least Zombie World and potentially Balerdroch for the negate and banish. For these reasons we play </span></span><span><span>three; </span></span><span><span>you can experiment with less but it will directly effect you</span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span> resource loop’s consistency. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Doomking Balerdroch x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>At last out of the main-deck Mayakashis we come to the Zombie World portion of the deck, starting with it</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> boss Doomking Balerdroch. You have several ways of getting to Balerdroch </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> chiefly Glow-Up Bloom — but honestly anything that gets it in the grave works fine as long as you or your opponent controls a field spell. Once on field Balerdroch represents a banish or negate that is triggered by any zombie effect anywhere, including the hand. This allows clever plays with our hand-traps of choice or </span></span><span><span>our</span></span><span><span> opponents’ depending on the meta. Balerdroch represents an additional recursive body for link climbs on your turn, and often this looping of monsters is enough to overwhelm your opponent in </span></span><span><span>conjunction</span></span><span><span> with the aforementioned banish-and-negate plus your innate Mayakashi effects from the grave. We play </span></span><span><span>two</span></span><span><span> because its very searchable and easy to </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish, plus it tends to brick at </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span>. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Jack O’Bolan x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Another stop on the standard Zombie-deck express, Jack O’Bolan is a fantastic way to unclog bricky hands. You can discard a variety of things to summon him </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> ideally Balerdroch or Glow-Up Bloom — but there are as many options as there are </span></span><span><span>z</span></span><span><span>ombies that plus in the grave. It can be funny and devastating to use his effect in conjunction with Zombie World to steal your opponents’ destroyed monsters, only to link them off and have it banished when it leaves the field. Due to his convenient level he can also help jump-start your Mayakashi lines with Dakki into Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi (more on this in the Combo Guide). Overall he’s worth running at </span></span><span><span>two</span></span><span><span> but considering he can searched off Glow-Up Bloom, any more would bloat the deck. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>So here’s a fun one, Hela is not the best in her own archetype but here she synergizes amazingly. We summon her off of the same fundamental Glow-Up Bloom line we summon Balerdroch with, so she’s not exactly a rare sight. Her effect lets us not only get rid off Yuki-Mususme or Balerdroch for advantage, but also summon any </span></span><span><span>z</span></span><span><span>ombie we want in our grave. This can be used on your opponent’s turn in order to generate interruptions in the form of the Mayakashi synchro monsters’ on-summon effects, such as Yoko’s pop or Tengu’s </span></span><span><span>backrow disruption</span></span><span><span>. Of course, doing this is also an excellent way to trigger Balerdroch’s banish proactively to shut down your opponent’s plays. We only play one copy of Hela due to Glow-Up Bloom ratios but more could be an option. </span></span><span><span>P</span></span><span><span>erhaps </span></span><span><span>you could experiment</span></span><span><span> with a greater Generaider package as non</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> of our xeno-locks stop us summoning from deck. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Glow-Up Bloom x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We’ve already talked at length about the uses of Glow-Up Bloom so I won’t belabour the point too much. Glow-Up Bloom is an auto-include in anything playing Balerdroch in my opinion. It can be bricky, but we have an out to that (see Combo Guide). It’s obviously most powerful when Zombie World is on the field, but even adding a zombie to hand can secure a follow-up play </span></span><span><span>for </span></span><span><span>next turn. We would honestly run </span></span><span><span>four </span></span><span><span>if we could! </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>eel free to experiment with you own ratios, but be prepared for the cohesiveness of your build </span></span><span><span>to</span></span><span><span> suffer.      </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Necroworld Banshee x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>So in a deck that depends on its field spell for interruption and recursion, are you really going to turn down extra copies of Terraforming? We don’t play three due to it being highly searchable with most of your standard lines, and it clogging up the deck’s valuable normal summon in the hand. Feel free to experiment with this slot; the ratios are up to preference and how much you value Zombie World in the current meta.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Mezuki x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We end the monsters on a truly classic zombie: Mezuki has been a staple in Zombie World lists since its release. In this deck it’s there to help extend and insulate your lines against hand-traps due to the myriad of ways to </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish zombies in the deck. You don’t really want to see Mezuki in the opene</span></span><span><span>r </span></span><span><span>without Jack O’Bolan or another way to discard for cost, so we choose to run one. You could experiment with more and maybe even a copy or two of Gozuki and Shiranui Solitaire if you value extension. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><u><b>Spells and Traps</b></u></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Return x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>W</span></span><span><span>e start the spell and trap section with a huge consistency booster in Mayakashi Return. It searches or </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolishes all of the Mayakashis, most importantly Hajun in the event you don’t have Yuki-Musume in your opener. It can also be used to extend with Yuki-Mususme if you drew Dakki and Hajun. </span></span><span><span>Additionally, Return can be</span></span><span><span> used to search all the Mayakashi Spells and Traps. Overall I think this card is an auto-include at </span></span><span><span>three </span></span><span><span>in any Mayakashi build for how much it boosts the consistency of your </span></span><span><span>lines</span></span><span><span>. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Winter x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>I’ll be honest, Winter is pretty bad. </span></span><span><span>It</span></span><span><span>s first and second effect are largely irrelevant in this build</span></span><span><span>, but w</span></span><span><span>e play it </span></span><span><span>for</span></span><span><span> its graveyard effect. </span></span><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>t allows us to convert an extra Mayakashi Return into a potential pop for monsters, spells, or traps depending on the contents of your graveyard. This can also be used to further your </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> lines on the crack-back. You could cut this in favour of another Monster Reborn-style effect if you think it would synergize better with your build. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Mayakashi Metamorphosis x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Metamorphosis is our best </span></span><span><span>R</span></span><span><span>eborn option. </span></span><span><span>I</span></span><span><span>t not only summons but also provides protection from targeting and a discard, which can unbrick cards like Yuki-Musume or Mezuki from your hand. Obviously you can search it with Return as with all Mayakashi cards, boosting the consistency of seeing it. The key use of this card is summoning your synchros on your opponent’s turn to interrupt their combos with a well-placed pop or mill. You can absolutely fiddle with the ratios of this one, although we like it at two as it complements the above-mentioned Winter and </span></span><span><span>R</span></span><span><span>eturn nicely. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Zombie World x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Zombie World has a storied history of meta and off-meta play over the years; it remains a rogue-</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>ier strategy in many tournaments to this day. This list’</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> use of the card focuses on its type-changing effect to lock your opponent out of summoning with Rivalry of Warlords. There are several ways to search this card including Terraforming and the a</span></span><span><span>fore</span></span><span><span>mentioned Necroworld Banshee, which can be </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolished as a part of your opening combo using Yuki-Musume if you don’t have need of her other targets. We have experimented with running Set Rotation and Magical Mid-Breaker Field to boost the consistency of Zombie World and shut down </span></span><span><span>your</span></span><span><span> opponent’s use of field spells and ability to target. It might be worth experimenting with if you’re so inclined, otherwise just play three. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Terraforming x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>There’s not much need to explain this one. Terraforming is a </span></span><span><span>four</span></span><span><span>th copy of Zombie World and potentially more if you run the Set Rotation combo mentioned above. We’ve discussed using Metaverse as well, but ultimately we felt it wasn’t worth the extra card. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Rivalry of Warlords x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Here we come to the most crucial half of the eponymous Rivalry lock. In conjunction with Zombie World, you can lock your opponent out of summoning anything other than zombie monsters. This disrupts the majority of current strategies aside from Eldlich (as of Oct. 2020) and makes up a large part of how this list deals with higher-tier opponents on the play. Balerdroch can be helpful for keeping the lock on field for longer with his recursive negate, along with any of your Mayakashi</span></span><span><span>s</span></span> <span><span>graveyard</span></span><span><span> effects. I would say that any </span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span>ogue-tier or below zombie deck should be playing Rivalry, but if you dislike locks feel free to switch these for more handtraps. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>One for One x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Another format staple, One for One is an additional copy of Hajun that can plus you depending on what you discard. Obviously we want to play as many consistency boosters for our starter as possible, so I wouldn’t consider this slot mutable if you want to run the lines we do (</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ee Combo Guide). It being a special summon from deck also opens up explosive lines with certain main-deck Mayakashi monsters. If for some reason this ever gets off the limited list, run as many as you can.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Foolish Burial x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>I’ve referenced this card several times as a catch-all for any effect that sends cards from the deck to the graveyard. Obviously in a zombie deck this card is near-mandatory in my opinion as it sets up Yuki-Mususme or Mezuki for set-up or extension respectively. Most of the time you’ll be sending Yuki-Musume to either set up Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch. Overall an amazing card; as with One for One, if it ever gets unlimited we’ll be playing more.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Pot of Avarice x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Pot of Avarice is pretty broken in Midrange. It’s especially relevant here since we are trying to dump a minimum of six optimal targets on the first turn </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>based on any hand with Hajun or access to him). From there Avarice is basically a Pot of Greed that refreshes your deck and allows you to synchro climb again. We only play two due to space constraints in this build, but three is a valid option </span></span><span>—</span><span><span> feel free to experiment. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Forbidden Droplet x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We finish</span></span></span><span><span><span> off the Spells and Traps </span></span></span><span><span><span>section </span></span></span><span><span><span>with the forma</span></span></span><span><span><span>t-</span></span></span><span><span><span>staple board-breaker Forbidden Droplet. We play it here as an out to the various </span></span></span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span><span><span><span>owers most decks are playing, and as </span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span> tool for simplifying boards going second. The discard for cost is obviously helpful here as we have monsters and spells that plus in the graveyard: Winter or Yuki-Musume for example. The slot could also be used for Super Poly — you’ll see below that we side it, but if you prefer it </span></span></span><span><span><span>then</span></span></span><span><span><span> feel free to take this out. I would caution that extra deck space is tight, so this will be a little more consisten</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><u><b>Handtraps and The Side Deck</b></u></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Notes on The Side and format techs</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Before I start on the hand-traps we play in this list </span></span></span><span><span><span>I’</span></span></span><span><span><span>d like to go over Jazzy_Sue’s position on the </span></span></span><span><span><span>side deck’s use</span></span></span><span><span><span>. The</span></span></span><span><span><span>y believe the side deck</span></span></span> <span><span><span>should </span></span></span><span><span><span>be used to patch up holes in the deck’s capabilities: as an example we play Lightning Storm in the side to help with the Mayakashis’ lack of bulk removal for spells or traps. You are welcome to play whatever you personally think is relevant, or just stick with our list. It wasn’t made with any particular tournament in mind so some fine-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>uning would be wise if you intend to play this list in one.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Ash is not a particularly strong hand-trap in a vacuum in my opinion due to its lack of destruction, but as a compliment to other disruption it can shut down a wide array of plays. In this list, that other disruption is normally some combination of: Rivalry, Zombie World or Balerdroch. The last is especially relevant as </span></span></span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span><span><span><span>sh is a zombie and can therefore trigger </span></span></span><span><span><span>B</span></span></span><span><span><span>alerdroch’s effect to banish natively whenever your opponent searches. If you’re particularly attached to another option for this slot, feel free to switch it out at the cost of some synergy. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion x 3</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>This pick is slightly more useful in this particular build, as it allows us to protect the one resource that really matters: the graveyard. Due to the toolbox style of the Mayakashis’ on-</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>ummon effects, banishing from the grave is devastating for our lines and interruption. Since the effect can be used </span></span></span><span><span><span>on</span></span></span><span><span><span> both graveyards there are a fa</span></span></span><span><span><span>ir</span></span></span><span><span><span> number of decks that don’t like to see this card. Ghost Belle’s effect will also trigger Balerdroch due to Ghost Belle being a </span></span></span><span><span><span>zombie</span></span></span><span><span><span> like Ash. Feel free to try other options in this slot, we mostly run it due to it being Jazzy_Sue’s favourite hand-trap.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><u><b>The Extra Deck</b></u></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We begin our look at the extra deck with the worst Mayakashi synchro. Oboro-Guruma is almost entirely here to help with dumping our synchros in the grave on turn one. Once he’s in the grave, Oboro-Guruma is most useful as a banish target to trigger your other Mayakashi synchro’s summon-from-the-grave effects. The battle protection can be useful as a last-ditch stall in a pinch, I guess. You really can’t play less of this if you want the first-turn combo to work properly but play more if you value battle protection. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Tsuchigumo is another not-great extra deck pick we play to assist with our initial climb. The mill effect on summon can potentially be useful for setup if you hit the right cards or in very grindy match-ups. This one is also a good banish for other stronger Mayakashi summons on your opponent’s turn. I would recommend running one of these for the sake of your first-turn play. but running any more is probably unnecessary as there are better uses for extra deck space. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Finally we come to a good Mayakshi synchro, Tengu being the first that we want to special summon on our opponent’s turn. When summoned this way Tengu pops an opponent’s spell or trap, allowing you to take out problem cards like like Dragunity Divine Lance or Dragon Buster Destruction Sword and allowing you to shut off your opponent’s combos or locks. Since the effect activates on the field it’s still vulnerable to Mystic Mine, but there are side deck options to compensate for this. We run two Tengu in this build in response to the current popularity of decks like Sky Striker, Salamangreat, and Monarchs. As mentioned above this is to out various back-row locks and combo pieces; if back-row becomes less prevalent then I’d recommend playing one of these. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Yoko is by far the best Mayakashi extra deck monster, just like its main-deck counterpart Dakki. Its on-summon effect is a non-targeted pop of any monster, which is certainly worth the two extra slots it takes up. This will form the backbone of your active disruptions, as aside from the pop Yoko is also blessed with a reasonable attack stat of 2900. This often allows it to clean up your opponent’s simplified boards the turn after it was special summoned. As an aside you don’t even have to climb into Yoko through the normal line as it can be summoned with just a Jack O’Bolan and Dakki; this is often how you start lines in situation where you don’t draw Hajun (see Combo Guide 3). Overall Yoko is a very worthwhile card to run in any Mayakashi build, although due to how tight the extra is we wouldn’t recommend running it at three.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>We end our look at the Mayakashi synchros with Gashadokuro, who notably has the second highest attack of any </span></span></span><span><span><span>z</span></span></span><span><span><span>ombie-type synchro monster. Aside from being a formidable beatstick he is also unaffected by card effects the turn he is summoned from the grave by any effect. This can assist with clearing lower-attack threats and finishing your opponent on the follow-up. This all said Gashadokuro’s primary use in this build is in the grave as protection of sorts for your link monsters, as your opponent may not want to waste valuable removal on a problem card like Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi or I:P Masquerena when a </span></span></span><span><span><span>T</span></span></span><span><span><span>owers with high at</span></span></span><span><span><span>tac</span></span></span><span><span><span>k is lurking in your grave. All this said I think you could probably get away with playing one of these in favour of the above-mentioned third Yoko, if you want more focus on disruption.    </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>As with the above synchros our first link is more of a name than anything else. We play two Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi to aid in clearing our main-deck Mayakashi xeno-lock on the follow up play, mainly Yuki-Musume and Hajun. Her effect can be handy in a pinch but mostly we use her to climb into Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy and the other Yuki-Onna for more effective disruption. You could play less of this but it would hamper your follow-up plays and restrict your ability to play non-zombie links. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi x 2</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>The second Yuki-Onna is much more impactful than its link two counterpart. Its a twice-per-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>urn permanent effect negate any time a monster activates its effect in the grave, like all of our aforementioned Mayakashi synchro monsters. If you’re starting to notice powerful synergy then welcome to the disruptive centre of the deck. Our first turn aims to end on this plus the Zombie World/Rivalry </span></span></span><span><span><span>l</span></span></span><span><span><span>ock and Balerdroch at minimum, which leaves us with two permanent effect negates, a monster effect negate, and the Rivalry lock. This is more than enough to stop most tier two and below decks in their tracks, although it can struggle with more meta relevant decks’ almost-</span></span></span><span><span><span>i</span></span></span><span><span><span>nfinite extension. </span></span></span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span><span><span><span> last funny note on Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi is that its first effect hard-counters banish-heavy decks like Thunder Dragon so long as it’s on field. We play two as to allow us to repeat our climb if we need to as link fours tend to attract negates, but you could cut this to one in favour of more non-zombie links or Cherries targets. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>At last we com</span></span></span><span><span><span>e</span></span></span><span><span><span> to the last Zombie link and the first non-Mayakashi extra deck monster. Anyone who’s played Zombie World decks before is likely familiar with the Shiranui archetype, or at the very least Shiranui Solitaire. Luckily for any of you new to this deck, Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy doesn’t have much to do with his archetype’s gimmick beyond summoning any of your banished zombie monsters. The primary use of this is to recycle high-impact synchros like Tengu and Yoko to allow you to out tempo your opponent over longer match-ups. As a fun secondary bonus if you summon Yoko, Skillsaga’s first effect wi</span></span></span><span><span><span>ll</span></span></span><span><span><span> protect it from destruction </span></span></span><span><span><span>and</span></span></span><span><span><span> allow for a follow-up into Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi on your turn. We only play one of these as the long games where this card shines are increasingly rare in the Oct 2020 format. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Th</span></span></span><span><span><span>at said, if the meta slows down in future more of these could be worth experimenting with.      </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>I:P Masquerena x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Now on to the non-zombie link monsters, and I know that might sound odd in a lock-based zombie deck but </span></span></span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>’ll explain. There are a couple scenarios we run into commonly that necessitate that we link off our monsters to further our plays, without being under </span></span></span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span><span><span><span>ivalry or the i</span></span></span><span><span><span>nn</span></span></span><span><span><span>ate xeno-lock of the main-deck Mayakashis. Masquerena is mostly for getting synchros in the graveyard and has the added benefit of allowing us to go into a link three or four with extra protection using our spent Mayakashis on our opponent’s turn. You could easily cut this in favour of another link two like Vampire Sucker or such but we think Masq has the most impact. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>Linkuriboh x 1</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>As mentioned above our non-zombie links are for resolving niche board states, this time with our main-deck Mayakashi. Linkuriboh is for linking off a negated Hajun in the event we don’t have Yuki-Musume. As a bonus this one can also be used to get your follow-up Yuki-Musume </span></span></span><span><span><span>(</span></span></span><span><span><span>or Glow-Up Bloom in a pinch</span></span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span> into the grave for recursion and link materi</span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span>l. This was an addition based on how many decks are playing Infinite Impermanence and Effect Veiler; it comes up relatively often and at least gets us something interactive on board. If you’d like to cut this you can, I don’t think there are many other link ones that would work but go ahead if you disagree. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>3. Combo Guide and Follow-Up Plays</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Before I go over the combos for the deck </span></span></span><span><span><span>I’</span></span></span><span><span><span>d just like to go over how best to use these lines, and why we mention the specific lines we do. To start it is best to think of this deck’s line</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span> in two distinct categories: Mayakashi, and Zombie World. These two categories are often resolved concurrently with the same resources and produce different kinds of interaction. I’ve already gone over the synergy between the different kinds of interaction in the deck-list so I won’t belabour that here, but needless to say any combination of these is normally enough to end the game within 4 turns. One thing to note is that the deck’s follow-ups are highly variable depending on both match-up and preference, so we recommend testing the deck extensively to see what you want it to do prior to taking it into the meta. We will recommend the follow-ups we favour, but take that with a grain of salt </span></span></span><span><span><span>as none of this is tournament-</span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>ested</span></span></span><span><span><span>. Finally the math below may not be accurate to the exact percentile but should be good enough for you to get an idea of the likelihood of seeing these opens and where similar lines may go. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>1. Dakki + Yuki-Musume</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>So we’re going to start with one of the </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> optimal openings for the deck, coming in at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>40%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span> to open these </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> cards or access to them. We resolve this by normal summoning Dakki then special summoning Yuki-Musume, using its effect to foolish either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom depending on if you have access to Zombie World or not. If you don’t you’ll want to use Necroworld Banshee’s effect to get Zombie World on the field before starting your synchro climb. Starting from Oboro-Guruma you’ll want to climb through all the Mayakashi synchro monsters up to Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi, summoning Dakki back every time you send it to the grave. If you have access to a </span></span></span><span><span><span>R</span></span></span><span><span><span>eborn effect such as Mayakashi Metamorphosis you’ll want to summon Dakki one last time and link both of them off for Yuki-Onna, the Ice </span></span></span><span><span><span>M</span></span></span><span><span><span>ayakashi. This is to give the synchro you summon on your opponent’s turn protection as it tears up their plays. From this point your best follow-up is to summon Yuki-Musume again to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch, all so that you can link the Yukis (Onna and Musume) plus the synchro you summoned earlier into Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi. This leaves you with a board of the link four plus Balerdroch going into your opponent’s turn, plus whatever other disruption you drew aside f</span></span></span><span><span><span>ro</span></span></span><span><span><span>m the two cards listed.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>2. Hajun + Yuki-Musume</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>The next hand we’ll be going over is Hajun plus </span></span></span><span><span><span>Yuki-Musume</span></span></span><span><span><span>, at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>30% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>to open going first. This hand resolves not unli</span></span></span><span><span><span>ke</span></span></span><span><span><span> our first open w</span></span></span><span><span><span>ith us normal summoning Hajun to special summon Dakki from deck, before special summoning Yuki-Musume. We again use Yuki-Musume’s effect to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom depending on our access to Zombie World as mentioned above. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From this point we will activate Zombie World using Necroworld Banshee’s effect before starting our synchro climb using Dakki and Hajun. We’ll climb all the way to </span></span></span><span><span><span>Gashadokuro</span></span></span> <span><span><span>before </span></span></span><span><span><span>summoning Dakki, and linking Dakki and Hajun for Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi </span></span></span><span><span><span>before summoning Dakki one last time. From here we link everything off for the link four Yuki-Onna, leaving us with a fully set-up graveyard and a twice-per-turn permanent effect negate anytime we summon from grave, plus whatever we summon from the grave. Your opponent’s turn should play out with you restricting their plays and summoning any Mayakashis you can either with cards like Metamorphosis that you opened or the innate Mayakashi graveyard effects. You should be left with a Mayakashi synchro or link on the field and at least Yuki-Musume still in grave. This allows you to </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolish again on your </span></span></span><span><span><span>next</span></span></span><span><span><span> tun by summoning Yuki-Musume, ideally for Glow-Up Bloom to get you Balerdroch for finishing out the game or insulating your other disruption. Your lines will diverge here depending on your opponent’s deck and hand, but in our testing the game rarely goes much more than a couple turns after you execute this line. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>3. Dakki and Jack O’Bolan plus discard</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>To begin this one I’ll state that this is not the most likely of openings at about</span></span></span><span><span><span><b> 15%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span> but we wanted to mention it to illustrate how one should best use Jack O’Bolan </span></span></span><span><span><span>in-conjunction with other openings. One should begin by special summoning Jack O’Bolan with whatever discard you have access to, ideally Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom for more disruption but Mezuki will do </span></span></span><span><span><span>for set</span></span></span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span><span><span><span>p later. From here we’ll normal summon Dakki and start our synchro climb from Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi through to Gashadokuro and finally Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi. You might be noticing this is similar to </span></span></span><span><span><span>both of the openings we mentioned above and you’d be right </span></span></span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span><span><span><span> our opening is pretty standard, it’s the follow-ups that vary. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From here we have a couple options based on what you discarded and what else you drew in your open</span></span></span><span><span><span>ing hand</span></span></span><span><span><span>. If you discarded Necroworld Banshee and drew Metamorphosis for example, your board will look much like </span></span></span><span><span><span>the </span></span></span><span><span><span>first two </span></span></span><span><span><span>mentioned boards, only with restricted access to your Mayakashi graveyard effects. As a different example if we discarded Mezuki and didn’t draw Metamorphosis </span></span></span><span><span><span>once we’ve done our climb, we’ll want to activate Mezuki for Jack O’Bolan so that we have an option to bring back our Yoko or Gashadokuro depending on our opponent’s board. This play overall is not as strong as those mentioned above but it’s also less common. </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>rom this you should know how to resolve it </span></span></span><span><span><span>or other hands like it</span></span></span><span><span><span> optimally when it comes up. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>4. Glow-Up Bloom and </b></span></span></span><span><span><span><b>N</b></span></span></span><span><span><span><b>o Normal Summon</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>I’ll be honest this hand is unlikely at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>10% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>and it’s honestly pretty bad in comparison to the other hands we’ve gone over. The reason </span></span></span><span><span><span>we decided to mention this is </span></span></span><span><span><span>it’s similar to how openings with just Hajun play out when the opponent negates H</span></span></span><span><span><span>aj</span></span></span><span><span><span>un’s effect. Regardless of which level one you’ve ended up with on field, from here you’ll want to activate Zombie World if you have any access to it, then link </span></span></span><span><span><span>off Glow-Up Bloom (or Hajun if applicable) for Linkuriboh. This will let you activate Glow-Up Bloom’s effect, either searching </span></span></span><span><span><span>Jack O’Bolan if we don’t have Zombie World up or </span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>ummoning Balerdroch if we do. </span></span></span><span><span><span>If you used Hajun for all of this you might be wondering what the point of dumping Hajun is: </span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span>imply put we play 8 different reborn effects in the main deck so the chances of us opening one of them is </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>65%</b></span></span></span><span><span><span>. While not guaranteed this happens often enough that we consider it a valid follow-up option, as Hajun’s effect triggers </span></span></span><span><span><span>on special summon </span></span></span><span><span><span>which</span></span></span><span><span><span> allow</span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span><span><span> us to basically redo our opening play. All told, versions of this opener will leave you with Zombie World as well as Balerdroch and Linkuriboh so that you have some interaction on your opponents turn or a repeatable Hajun line on your next turn. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>5. One for One and Dakki or Yuki-Musume plus discard</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>At last we come to the final opening we’ll be discussing today, at </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>7% </b></span></span></span><span><span><span>this is respectable for one of the best hands in the deck.</span></span></span><span><span><span> We value this hand because it puts up the same disruptions as </span></span></span><span><span><span>hands one or two potentially without our normal summon. </span></span></span><span><span><span>We start with One for One to summon Hajun in order to special either Dakki or Yuki-Musume, depending on what you have in hand. From here we ideally want to normal summon Dakki if we drew it, before </span></span></span><span><span><span>synchro summoning with Dakki and Hajun into Oboro-Guruma. From here it’s business as usual to climb through our synchros using Dakki’s effect every time until we get to a board of Dakki, Yuki-Musume, and Gashadokuro. </span></span></span><span><span><span>From here we’ll link Dakki and Yuki-Musume off for the link two Yuki-Onna to get Yuki-Musume </span></span></span><span><span><span>in grave. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Next we use</span></span></span><span><span><span> Yuki-Musume’s effect to special </span></span></span><span><span><span>summon </span></span></span><span><span><span>it from the graveyard, </span></span></span><span><span><span>F</span></span></span><span><span><span>oolishing either Necroworld Banshee or Glow-Up Bloom if you drew Zombie World. This will leave us ideally with materi</span></span></span><span><span><span>a</span></span></span><span><span><span>l to make the link four Yuki-Onna with Zombie </span></span></span><span><span><span>W</span></span></span><span><span><span>orld up and our full grave set-up for </span></span></span><span><span><span>Re</span></span></span><span><span><span>born effects on the opponent’s turn. If you drew Zombie World you will also have Balerdroch for the extra negate and banish. Overall this hand offers the most </span></span></span><span><span><span>potential follow-ups as you can </span></span></span><span><span><span>perform any combination</span></span></span><span><span><span> of the follow-ups mentioned above, normally in multiples due to </span></span></span><span><span><span>t</span></span></span><span><span><span>his hand’s excellent recursion. </span></span></span>

<span><span><span><b>4. Final Thoughts</b></span></span></span>

<span><span><span>Before I wrap this up I’d like to thank everyone for reading this decklist and guide. </span></span></span><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>f you have any questions or suggestions about the list feel free to comment or message me. As far as my final thoughts on the list I’d say this deck has lot of potential in slower or restricted metas, but in the current climate mid-range is less viable due to threats like Dragon Link and Infernoble Knight. This list is pretty resilient to most handtraps except Called By The Grave, but due to the density played by even tier </span></span></span><span><span><span>two</span></span></span><span><span><span> and below decks our plays are stopped more often than not in event play. Casually this list is amazing </span></span></span><span><span><span>due to the frequent and recursive threats our boards generate being beyond the </span></span></span><span><span><span>capabilities</span></span></span><span><span><span> of many rogue and off-meta decks. What’s more, Jazzy_Sues irl build came in at under </span></span></span><span><span><span>$</span></span></span><span><span><span>150 US</span></span></span><span><span><span>D</span></span></span><span><span><span> (</span></span></span><span><span><span>w</span></span></span><span><span><span>ith some substitutions) so you can get into this build for relativ</span></span></span><span><span><span>el</span></span></span><span><span><span>y little compared to other decks of this calibre. As far as the deck’s future </span></span></span><span><span><span>goes,</span></span></span><span><span><span> I think there is some promise </span></span></span><span><span><span>competitively</span></span></span><span><span><span> in the Eldlich Mayakashi variant with the announcement of the new Eldlich </span></span></span><span><span><span>fusion monster and continuous spell. I’m given to understand that Jazzy_Sue is already working on it. </span></span></span><span><span><span>In the meantime we hope you enjoyed our first Halloween effort, </span></span></span><span><span><span>and </span></span></span><span><span><span>we hope to bring you more in the future. </span></span></span><span><span><span>U</span></span></span><span><span><span>ntil next </span></span></span><span><span><span>time,</span></span></span><span><span><span> stay safe and spooky fellow YuGiOh fans!</span></span></span>"

With the power of Helios and Homunculus, ","The main goals of this deck is to field the cards Gravekeeper's Servant and Macro Cosmos/Banisher of the Radiance/ Banisher of the Light/ Dimensional Fissure to prevent the opponent from attacking. In this way the opponent, no matter how powerful monsters he has, It will not be able to attack you as long as the two-card combo is active.

&nbsp;

You will then need to use the rest of the cards and especially the combo Gold Sarcophagus + Necroface to remove as many cards from the game as possible, in this way, once a Helios/Golden Homunculus card is evoked, their attack will be so high that they can wipe out any monster of the opponent.

Useful combos:
<ul>
 	<li>D.D Survivor can be used to evoke Helios/Homunculus, once removed from the field it can return at the end of the turn and can be useful in case you have no more monsters in the field.</li>
 	<li>Chaos Zone + Necroface + (Soul Release) is very convenient in case many monsters have been removed from the game, in this case it is ensured that once per turn any monster can be resummoned.</li>
 	<li>The Cheerful Coffin, Monster Gate and Dimensional Alchemist are very useful in combination with Soul Release to increase the attack of Helios or to have monsters removed from the deck, so they can be re-enacted via Chaos Zone or d.d.r Different Dimension Reincarnation</li>
 	<li>Soul Absorption and Graverobber's Retribution are used to heal the LP and respectively to inflict constant damage to the opponent's LP.</li>

Kryptonite against decks that relies heavily on extra deck.,"<strong><span>OVERVIEW</span></strong>

I've been brainstorming on how to improve Nekroz's consistency and efficiency since unicore has been of the banlist. Sadly since we're in an era where handtrap is most likely in a deck, adjusting the deck became much more challenging to the point where it's consistency decreases and it's endboard is not that worth due to it's consistency. But the Dogmatika Archetype made Nekroz's life much easier: increasing their consistency, disruption, board breaking, and it's sustainability against extra deck reliant decks. These two archetypes are like kryptonite against decks that relies on their extra deck a lot: with nekroz having unicore who is a skill drain against monsters that are summoned from the extra deck and of course there is brionac who is a multipurpose card, it can be used to search a Nekroz monster or  you can ritual summon it to bounce 2 extra deck monsters, and lastly the Dogmatika monsters, ecclesia provides a sustain since she can't be destroyed by battle against extra deck monsters, and the best monster in the Dogmatika when using it with nekroz is Maximus, he can dump Herald of the Arc Light and Titaniklad/Wind Pegasus/N'tss/Skull Knight which will result in a huge advantage for the user since you can search for a ritual monster/spell and still have a negation/destroy. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this build since it can compete with meta decks, though do note that in order to utilize this deck's full potential you need to analyze your opponent's deck and in and outs of this deck, since this deck is only as good as it's user.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>2 CARD COMBO (BRIONAC + ANY IMPCANTATION MONSTER BESIDES TALISMANDRA AND CHALISLIME)</span></strong>

Take note that you don't need to specifically draw these two cards in your opening hand in order to perform this combo. The main goal of this is to have access to Cyber Angel Benten be used in a Ritual Summon in order to search for Vanity's Ruler, while having two monsters on the field without having use your normal summon, so that you can tribute Summon Vanity's Ruler
<ul>
 	<li>Use the Impcantation monster's effect two special summon Impcantation Talismandra, use Talismandra's effect in order to search for Cyber Angel Benten.</li>
 	<li>Use Brionac's effect to search for Clausolas, then use it's effect to search for Nekroz Cycle.</li>
 	<li>Use Nekroz Cycle to special summon Brionac from the GY, tributing Cyber Angel Benten. Use Benten's effect to search for Vanity's Ruler.</li>
 	<li>Tribute summon Vanity's Ruler using the two Impcantation monsters.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong><span>EXTRA DECKS MONSTERS EXPLANATION</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Elder Entity N'tss - It's a standard card to run for Nekroz and Dogmatika since these two archetypes sends a lot of extra deck monsters to GY to function.</li>
 	<li>PSY-Framelord Omega - Good for recycling your extra deck monster in the GY. This can also be used to remove a card from your opponent's GY.</li>
 	<li>Wind Pegasus @Ignister - A good card to be in the GY since it will make your opponent think twice to destroy your monsters because this can send their monster back to the deck/extra deck if they do so.</li>
 	<li>Daigusto Emeral - Good in the grind game, though you will not use this most of your games.</li>
 	<li>Nephthys, The Sacred Flame - If your opponent's deck have trouble against a monster that has a high attack, cannot be destroyed by battle and card effect, and cannot be targeted by card effects, the this dude is your saviour.</li>
 	<li>Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle - Same reason as Daigusto Emeral.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong><span>SIDE DECK CARDS EXPLANATION</span></strong>

So most cards in this are for going 2nd since the main deck is not that great for breaking boards.
<ul>
 	<li>Artifact Lancea - Good to side against decks that needs to banish cards. You can also use this to avoid macro cosmos, D.D. Crow, Dimension Shifter, etc.</li>
 	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - Since this deck cannot run handtraps like Ash Blossom and Infinite Impermanence, using a handtrap that has a lingering effect will be wiser since it will greatly limit your opponent's options. Droll is really good at today's meta in TCG since Called By The Grave is limited and there is not Crossout Designator. Also most combo decks now doesn't care if they got handtraps like 1-2 times since they can still put a decent board.</li>
 	<li>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Super Poly target 1.</li>
 	<li>Mudragon of the Swamp - Super Poly target 2.</li>
 	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Good to side against a going 1st combo deck, this card paired with evenly matched is a nightmare for them.</li>
 	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - Good against backrow decks. I use 2 of this instead 2 of twin twisters since this deck needs many resources as much as possible.</li>
 	<li>Twin Twisters - I only use this if my opponent's backrow is so annoying.</li>
 	<li>Super Polymerization - Self explanatory card.</li>
 	<li>Evenly Matched - Board breaker. Pair this with Dark Ruler No More and your opponent will be cryin'.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Don't forget about the Nekroz's ritual spells effect in the GY.</li>
 	<li>Trishula's effect needs to banish exactly 3 cards from hand, field, and GY.</li>
 	<li>Be wise what to dump from the extra deck.</li>
 	<li>This deck is only as good as it's user.</li>
</ul>

Hope you enjoy!,"Invoked and Magistus are two decks I think that they synergize quite well together making for some interesting plays. The deck focuses more on hitting your opponent when time arises, or by making some power plays. Magistus is a interesting archetype that equips Magistus monsters from the extra deck to themselves for effects, which I found to be a pretty neat idea!

Here is a quick explanation of each of the Magistus bosses: Vafram can destroy your all of your opponent's face up cards when he is destroyed, if he is equipped to a monster the equipped monster cannot be destroyed by spells and traps. <a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Ninaruru can destroy a s/t your opponent controls as long as you destroy a Magistus card in your own s/t zone, and when she is equipped to a monster, it can attack twice. </a>

<a data-name=""Ninaruru"">Finally, we have Saint Aiwass who can (target) a monster on the field during either players main phase and equip himself to the selected monster. If you equipped him to an opponents monster, you take control of it. Although it will not be able to activate it's effects, the equipped monster gains a nice 1000 atk/def boost. </a>

Have fun playing Invoked Magistus!  ^-^"

Too many combo variations and end boards to list, but that is the basic concept.

You can try running Dragoon as well but I felt like it wasn't worth having an extra 3 bricks in a deck already with quite a few.

This deck always wants to go first so you can full combo and prevent them from playing. I didn't feel like doing a combo tutorial on this deck because I didn't think it was necessary. You should by now know the synchro, orcust, and phantom knights combo as its nothing new. The deck is just full of extenders and really pushes the Orcust, Phantom Knights and Dark Warrior engines to their fullest potential. In my experience, the deck doesn't brick very much and is pretty consistent. I will explain the small combos here you may not already know exist within the deck. The basic Orcust and Synchro combo are in here for more draw power and getting out Apollousa. There are extenders like Chaos Space for the baby dragons and discarding the Orcust pieces. The Meklord combo is easy. Use <a data-name=""Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core"">Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core</a>'s effect to search out <a data-name=""Meklord Assembly"">Meklord Assembly</a> and then use Meklord Assembly to search out <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel - Synchro Absorption"">Meklord Emperor Wisel - Synchro Absorption</a> and use Meklord Assembly's second effect to discard an Orcust monster or whatever you to want to discard that will benefit you and destroy Nucleus to bring out <a data-name=""Meklord Emperor Wisel"">Meklord Emperor Wisel</a> then you can go full synchro combo if you had an extender like Adhara or the baby dragons. Then after all that, going into Apollousa, you should do full Orcust combo and then Phantom Knight combo to get one Fog Blade and the Phantom Knight rank up magic spell. You must have Dingrisu in grave to do the rank up magic combo. During their main phase use Cymbal Skeleton in grave to summon Ding but dont use dings effect unless its to send a card from field to grave. Then use rank up magic to go into <a data-name=""True King of all Calamities"">True King of all Calamities</a>. I suppose if someone comments down below for a combo tutorial I will do it and upload the replay to mediafire for you guys. But most combos here aren't anything new except the Meklord one I came up with that is an extended play. Using <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a> to discard an Orcust monster for full Orcust combo is also another great play we all love lol. Another small tip you may not realize is using Adhara plus another monster you can go into Haqlifibrax and summon Brass Bombard which is full Orcust combo, especially if you have another Orcust monster to special summon off Bombard's graveyard effect. As always, I hope you guys enjoy the deck profile and stay tuned for more awesome custom deck profiles made by me!"

Plus sides to getting  high as all hell? Fuel to making bad yu-gi-oh decks. My personal drug addiction aside, we have a new deck here; Dragonmaids with a Invoked engine. I adore Dragonmaids, but personally, I found that they're not super powerful on their own. To supplement this, I included a Invoked engine, which is great for spamming out multiple fusions to help the Dragonmaids. It also mashes quite well with the Dragonmaids, as the Dragonmaids have an array of attributes. Now, onto the guide.
You'll want to get a low level Dragonmaid out to activate their effect, whether it be searching or sending a card to the GY. Your goal should be to turbo out House as fast as possible, then use the engine pieces for Invoked to get out whatever you can, based off of what's on hand. Then go into the battle phase, and bounce the low level Dragonmaids back to the hand for stronger ones from the hand or GY.
Deck list explanation.
We have the core dragonmaid cards, with the usual shit. For the humanoid forms, 3 kitchen, 3 chamber, 3 parlor, and 1 nurse. Kitchen is great for searching cards, Chamber is great for searching the fusion spell, Chamber is great for GY set up, and Nurse is good for late game revival to go into combos. We also have all of their dragon forms, which can be used to go into during the battle phase.  We have their fusion spell, to get out House as fast as possible, Send-off to special out monsters, Tidying for removal, and the other trap I forget the name of for searching. We also have House in the extra deck, and then Sheou, House's dragon form. You'll want to get out House, use her for a little bit to get off her effects for removal, and then fuse into Sheou.
Invoked Engine
The invoked engine carries 3 Aleister as a main core of it, for fusion material, Invokation is their fusion spell, and Magical Meltdown for searching Aleister. In the extra deck, we have lots of their fusion monsters, all of which are choices you can make based off of the attributes you have on hand and the attributes you have.
As always, any suggestion or advice is appreciated. Have a good day. (Also, i know y'all prob don't care, but I got a GF! It's housewife time)"

Endboard is VFD with Chaos Ruler (can Borreload Savage too, but it lacks follow-up) and since our goal is to send <strong>Baking</strong> and <strong>Plaguespreader</strong> to GY, <strong>Uni-Zombie/Shiranui Solitaire</strong> are the best starter. To complement that we use Foolish Burial, One for One, and Tuner's High. We don't use Allure of Darkness as we need our Skull Servants in GY, Tuner's High kinda replace its role tho. King of the Skull Servants act as follow-up, 3 copies for easier search via Chaos Ruler or 2 draws from our combo, Monster Reborn works good too since we will have 1 King in GY (and 4 Skull Servants, means 4k via Monster Reborn, 5k if it's not) while being great extender. Chaos Ruler also can re-summon itself while dumping more Skull Servant and/or Plaguspreader, making our follow-up play legit. The rest are just staples, better with dark/light attribute (Nibiru and Veiler) as Chaos Ruler target for extra interruption.

Welcome to my take on Unchained. Below I've laid out my deck list choices, I hope they inspire you in your take on the deck.

 	<li>Card choices</li>
 	<li>Main combo/opening hands</li>
 	<li>Final comment on outing Dragoon</li>
</ul>
<strong>Why blind 2nd</strong>?

I dont think there is much debate here. I have played going 1st and 2nd versions a lot. What ends up happening is that your line of play is pretty much the same either way, but in a going 2nd strategy you can use your opponents monsters as link material instead of ending on a mediocre board with 1 - 3 interruptions.

<strong>Card choices</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>3x all of the Unchained monsters. Pretty standard. Optionally you can play 2x Sarama, this decreases consistency and grind game but increases the ceiling of the deck.</li>
 	<li>2x Abominable and 1x Soul of disaster. Pretty standard too. I would love to play 2x Soul of disaster but its too much of a brick imo.</li>
 	<li>3x Ash blossom. Most generic hand trap in game.</li>
 	<li>3x gamma + driver. This hand trap is NUTS. Not just in general, but specifically in this deck. You play 3x Extrav, 3x Aruha and 3x Rota which all activate in your hand with no monsters on the field (get the hint already???). Also, you often end up with no monsters on the field due to ramming your monsters into your opponents with the goal of triggering their effects in battle phase (giving you an empty board).</li>
 	<li>2x DD Crow. This is really up to you and nr 1 card choice you can/should change. Its just that DD Crow is a personal favourite of mine, with banishing not just monsters and being a quick effect it really provides a unique game mechanic (e.g. hit Miscellaneousaurus from Dinos).</li>
 	<li>1x Pankratops. Hands down this card gets banned next banlist (works really well with evenly matched I must point out).</li>
 	<li>3x rota.</li>
 	<li>3x Extravagance.</li>
 	<li>1x Harpie feather duster.</li>
 	<li>2x Dark ruler no more. Amazing in this deck under the right circumstances. You could play 3 but I think its too much with 3x Extravagance.</li>
 	<li>3x of both Unchained traps.</li>
 	<li>3x Evenly matched. I can not express how much I love this card. Especially in Unchained too, since skipping battle phase does pretty much nothing (you will OTK in only 1/10 games, mostly you will do 3x 1500 + 300 damage anyway).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Card choices (extra deck)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>3x Unchained link 2, 3</li>
 	<li>2x Unchained Abomination</li>
 	<li>2x Knightmare unicorn (going into unicorn on opponents turn is gold!)</li>
 	<li>Topologic zeroboros and Bomber dragon are both nice options to keep the interruptions interactive on opps turn (bomber dragon for Salamangreat/Crusadia e.g.,  Zeroboros for any deck that can Soul charge/spam tokens)</li>
 	<li>Framelord omega</li>
 	<li>Pegasus @Ignister is INSANE against Dogmatika. The synergy with this deck is unreal</li>
 	<li>Dingirsu for non targeting and non destructive removal. Be careful with the fiend lock in this deck ofc.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Card choices (side)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>DD Crow, as I said personal favourite.</li>
 	<li>Artifact package. You can pop your own Scythe if you have too</li>
 	<li>Cosmic cyclone and Heavy storm duster for instant win against backrow.</li>
 	<li>Imperial order and Skill drain are free Ws. Especially skill drain is must for this deck, having all your Unchained monsters activate in GY.</li>
 	<li>3x Lancea because Dino matchup is really bad. Like really hah.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Main combo/opening hands</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>As I said earlier, Gamma + 1 of (rota, Extrav, Aruha) is on itself full combo. Make sure to use the Gamma to go into Omega for the +1 ;).</li>
 	<li>Dark ruler + any Unchained monster is full break a board. Activate Dark ruler, ram monster and bring either Abominable or Soul of disaster to the field and go on from there.</li>
 	<li>Evenly matched. Activate evenly matched, if it resolves you win, if it doesnt, do the standard Aruha/Rakea + trap combo.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Final comment on outing dragoon</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Under the right circumstances, facing a Dragoon can be an instant scoop. Know how to deal with this card. Best is to go straight to battle phase, ram Unchained monster, and bring out Abominable to ram into the dragoon. If your monster eff in GY gets negated by dragoon that is actually pretty good, because it does not gain the +1k Atk stat. Also, activating Rakea on field instead of Aruha in hand is also encouraged if you must because Aruha does not trigger when destroyed from hand.</li>

The Mayakashi engine is pretty straightforward, you want to use Hajun to summon Dakki and begin Synchro climbing to Gashadokuro, with Yuki Musume as an extender that can either start another ladder, or preferably help make the powerful Link 4 Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi. She can make the ATK of a monster 0 and negate it's effects when a monster is summoned from, or an effect is activated in the GY up to twice per turn.

As for Eldlich, he provides a notorious advantage engine over the course of interrupting your opponent with soldiers of the Golden Land and summoning himself or other Zombies with the Eldlixirs, all of which float in the GY.

Cards such as Yuki-Musume can help get Golden Lord to the GY so you can SS him by his own effect. And the Scarlet and White Eldlixirs can revive any Zombie from the GY while Golden Lord is on the field, allowing you to summon your Mayakashi Synchros from the GY proactively to pop stuff, instead of waiting for your opponent to destroy the current one on the board.

The two archetypes are pretty easy to grasp on their own, and do not get in each others way. So I thought I would make a quick profile on it. I'm not a master of either of these two themes, so feel free to correct any misunderstanding I might have in the comments, or ask any other questions."

Main Attribute, Type: Light/Dark, Thunder

The main strategy of the deck is to go second and utilize your myriad of board wiping effects, such as Lightning Storm and Thunder Dragon Titan, to clear the way for your high attack monsters to OTK. The deck features a number of relatively easy to summon monsters in order to swarm the field for massive damage potential. When forced to go first, the deck provides protection in the forms of Denko Sekka, Thunder Dragon Thunderstormech, and Thunder Dragonlord.  3 Lightning Storm and 3 Pot of Desires can be swapped out for other cards if needed (other handtraps or Kaijus are good alternatives)."

So I've decided to cut some cards on this HERO build and add infinite impermanence to adjust in the meta game. The reason for that is because of thunder dragon, just by putting thunder dragon colossus in the field will be a nightmare for HERO users. I removed Destiny HERO - Celestial and Triple Tactics Talent, the reason for that it's because most of the time i can't use their effect. I've also cut Fusion Destiny to 2 since I removed Celestial, I can now only use 1 Fusion Destiny once per game due to the lack of material. With those adjustments, my HERO deck will now be more consistent and will have an additional negation. I've also made some changes in the side deck since some of the previous cards in it are not as effective as I have imagined.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Nibiru, The Primal Being - I only run 1 copy of it since it's just a target for Crossout Designator.</li>
 	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - A handy card to pop one of my opponent's card .</li>
 	<li>Artifact Lancea - Good against deck that needs to banish cards. Decks like Thunder Dragon, Phantom Knights, etc.</li>
 	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - If you think ash blossom is not enough to stop your opponent's combo, use this card instead.</li>
 	<li>Mask Change - The last mask change is in the side deck because this build is for blind going 2nd. I know mask change is a good card but it can be a brick if I run 3 copies of it in the main deck while my goal is to break my opponent's board.</li>
 	<li>Crossout Designator - I was wrong about this card, this card is my savior against Nibiru, Maxx C, etc.</li>
 	<li>Vanity's Emptiness - A self explanatory card.</li>
 	<li>Anti-Spell Fragrance - It's like a nerfed Imperial Order.</li>
 	<li>Imperial Order - Another self explanatory card.</li>
 	<li>Red Reboot - Once again a self explanatory card.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Even if your opponent's end board going 1st will have multiple negates/disruption, don't be afraid to still go 2nd because this deck has more cards of break boarding compared and handtraps compared to it's control cards.</li>
 	<li>Always use a card effect first before chaining Forbidden Droplet, it will help you save resources since you can send the activated card on the field to the GY and it will still resolve normally.</li>
 	<li>Always think of the possible situation if your opponent negates a certain card that you'll use, think of a fallback option so that you will still put on a board.</li>

Since the debut of Dogmatika archetype in TCG, it's been one of the most used engine. The most famous deck of this archetype is the Invoked Dogmatika, just by reading you know what the deck would look like so I've made a little bit of tweaking. I did not put a shaddoll engine here since it's gonna be inconsistent, so I've added cards that will cover up the deck's weak point. By adding more draw power, disruption , and board break cards I've been able to add more consistency to it and increase it's board breaking ability. The major problem of this deck is that if you do not have access to aleister or nadir/ecclesia, it'll be a hard game for you, luckily with the help of the handtraps, trap cards, and draw cards the probability of it happening will be lower, even if it happens you will have time to gather resources since your traps will buy you time.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>UNIQUE CARDS EXPLANATION</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - Since you will not always be the one winning the decision on who will go 1st, I've put this in the main deck just in case. A material for the earth Invoked.</li>
 	<li>Mind Control - Same reason with Pankratops.</li>
 	<li>Spellbook of Knowledge - A fallback option in case your monster's effect is negated, since most of your monsters are spellcasters.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Nibiru, The Primal Being - Good for board breaking especially against opponent that does not have a bait or negation.</li>
 	<li>Artifact Lancea - To avoid being countered by retaliating c.</li>
 	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Just in case your handtraps did not do the work, use this card.</li>
 	<li>Mystic Mine - A good card to slow the pace of the game, which is favorable to this deck.</li>
 	<li>Evenly Matched - Self explanatory card. A good card to use with dark ruler no more.</li>
 	<li>Summon Limit - In the case that your opponent isn't that much affected by crackdown, use this instead</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>REMINDERS</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Always keep an eye on your resources, do not rush to end the game.</li>
 	<li>Side out cards that will be not use that much: For example side out dogmatika punishment, crackdown, feather duster, and cosmic cyclone against infernoble knight, side in nibiru, dark ruler no more, and evenly matched.</li>
 	<li>Don't forget the effect of the extra deck monster that you will send to the GY.</li>
 	<li>Do not forget the side effect of using Dogmatika Punishmenth, which is you cannot special summon a monster from the extra deck until the end of your next turn.</li>

As we all know HERO is not always present when it comes to competitive scene, so I've tried various builds of it to fit in today's meta game. Fortunately I've found a build where it completely suits my playstyle which is an OTK with board wiping ability that has handtraps. It's consistency is a 10/10 to me when it comes to board wiping your opponent's field and it can dodge most of your opponent's targeting negeation since you have Vision HERO Increase, Mask Change, and Forbidden Droplet. Though in this build it's not a good idea to go 1st except when it's absolutely needed, the one condition of this HERO build when it goes 1st is that you need to have access to Mask Change or any handtraps in order to disrupt your opponent. The reason why i did not put Destiny HERO - Celestial and only put 2 Fusion Destiny is to decrease the chances of having a brick hand. Overall this deck is awesome to play especially when you know it's in and outs and how you expect what cards your opponent will negate.

&nbsp;

<strong><span>HANDTRAPS EXPLANATION</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - A standard handtrap since it's usable against any deck.</li>
 	<li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird - Since Maxx C is banned here in  TCG, I've noticed that most combo decks are not afraid to continue their combo and most of them will not be stopped by 1 or 2 handtraps. So I've decided to use a handtrap that impacts them in a whole turn.</li>
 	<li>Infinite Impermanence - A pretty handy handtrap since it you can use this on either player's turn considering you control no cards on the field.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Dinowrestler Pankratops - A free body card and can pop  your opponent's card. Good card to use if you want to bait your opponent's negate.</li>
 	<li>Artifact Lancea - A handy card to use against banish type deck.</li>
 	<li>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit - Since Numeron is still a thing in TCG, this card is a must.</li>
 	<li>Mask Change - The single mask change that's in the side deck because this build is blind going 2nd. Side this in if you are planning to go 1st.</li>
 	<li>Twin Twisters - A must have card against backrow decks. I was not planning to put this card if Pankratops is not limited.</li>
 	<li>Prohibition - Since Crossout Designator is not available in TCG, this card is a must have if you don't want to get Nibiru'd</li>
 	<li>Summon Limit - A substitute for Vanity's Emptiness since it's banned in TCG.</li>
 	<li>Anti-Spell Fragrance - Kinda like Imperial Order so i put 2 of  it.</li>
 	<li>Imperial Order - Self explanatory card.</li>
 	<li>Red Reboot - Another self explanatory card</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong><span>REMINDERS</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Always keep in mind to bait your opponent's negation/disruption.</li>
 	<li>As much as possible you want to activate another card before chaining Forbidden Droplet, so you can send that card on the field to the GY. That way you can save some resources.</li>
 	<li>As much as possible avoid using a monster handtrap if you're oppoent doesn't have a monster on the field, you might get baited so that they can use PSY-Framegear Gamma.</li>

<span><strong>THUNDER DRAGONS</strong></span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragonduo:</strong> A chaos monster searchable by Dark.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragonroar:</strong> You can discard it to recover resources but more importantly it can summon a Thunder Dragon from the Deck as Dark for search or Matrix for disruption.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragonhawk:</strong> Revive if you discard it very necessary to continue some plays.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragon:</strong> Provides bodies in GY for fusion in addition to that if you control Titan you can destroy several cards.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragondark:</strong> If you send it it is a generic search for the archetype but if you do not plan to activate the effect you can add another for disruption or materials.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragonmatrix:</strong> It gives attack but actually gives disruption, it also recycles if it is sent to the graveyard in case you lack one in hand.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragon Fusion:</strong> Invoke using removed monsters or in very good GY since you will always have your monsters there but it can also be removed to search for a thunder monster which is very open and can help in recovery.</span>

<span><strong>Thunder Dragon Titan:</strong> Brutal asks for three materials but with kaminari only one destroys several times per turn and also protects himself several times.</span>

<span><strong>CHAOS</strong></span>

<span><strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer:</strong> It asks to remove 3 materials but in exchange it lets you gain 3 different effects depending on what you remove, the most common being to destroy 2 cards without targeting</span>

<span><strong>The Chaos Creator</strong>: Revive and recycle plus it's Thunder</span>

<span><strong>Collaserpent and Wyvernburster:</strong> They remove one to be summoned also they look for themselves they are very good since it is an advantage in any aspect.</span>

<span><strong>Chaos Space:</strong> Chaos search only for discards also recycles obviously is a good card</span>

<span><strong>Artifact</strong></span>

<span>It is a small engine that carries the deck but it serves to go first when invoking dagda and activating its set scyhte, on the opponent's turn you can destroy scythe with titan using matrix or dark thus leaving your rival without Extra Deck</span>

<span><strong>OTHER CARDS</strong></span>

<span><strong>Aloof and Solar:</strong> These guys are good normal summons. Aloof allows you to remove two cards and send solar to the graveyard and earn a token.</span>

<span><strong>Allure of Darkness:</strong> You draw two and remove a dark will almost always be an advantage you can remove dark or roar and gain its effects.</span>

<span><strong>Instant Fusion and Kaminari:</strong> Summons Kaminari and with that an easier Titan.</span>

<span><strong>Gold Sarcophagus:</strong> You remove a Thunder Dragon from the deck to gain its effect.</span>

<span><strong>Predaplant Verte Anaconda:</strong> Allows you to activate fusion from the deck.</span>

<span><strong>OTHER OPTIONS</strong></span>

<span><strong>Synchro Engine:</strong> Quickdraw is easily invoked discarding also if you use it together with a high-level thunder dragon you will win an ultimaya and with that if you set a card you can summon a Crystal Wing without restrictions.</span>

<span><strong>Dimension Shifter:</strong> It can make you gain resources since you don't lose anything if your cards are removed but your opponent is very likely to leave him in a bad situation.</span>

<span><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Moral lets destroy and Sactum invokes them for you practically for free.</span>"

Sadly my wish did not come true. The deck is too slow and obviously, a deck centralized around flip monsters is usually going to be way too slow. But, if you use one of the only playable flip centralized deck in the entire game, Shaddoll, you can make a pretty formidable strategy. Basically what you want to do is open something that is to the degree of ""Shaddoll Fusion"" + ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"". First, you will want to activate (this an assuming that you are going second and your opponent controls an extra deck monster) ""Shaddoll Fusion"" sending ""Shaddoll Beast"" and ""Performage Trick Clown"" summoning ""<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>"". Then as Chain Link 1 send ""Reeshaddoll Wendi"" with ""<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a>"". Then as Cain Link 2 draw a card with the effect of ""Shaddoll Beast"", lastly use the effect of ""Performage Trick Clown"" to Special Summon itself (if you didn't know, doing it in this exact order chain blocks your ""El Shaddoll <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">Construct's""</a> effect). Finally, your ""Reeshaaoll Wendi"" effect will activate Special Summoning a ""Shaddoll Beast"" from your deck in Facedown Defence Position. Next, you will activate ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"" adding a ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" and a ""Prediction Ritual"" from your Deck to your hand. Then activating ""Prediction Ritual"" you can tribute your Facedown ""Shaddoll Beast and your ""Performage Trick Clown"" to summon your ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"". During your end phase ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" Special Summoning your ""Shaddoll Beast"" back to your side of the field facedown, then during your opponent""s turn ""Prediction Princess Tarotrei"" can flip it back face up to draw two cards!"

<b>[Updated list/Strategy Guide V.1.4]</b>

<b>The guide will have discrepancies between it and the deck but that's just because I'm lazy and can't be bothered updating the deck's guide past the 1.2 revision - but I continuously update the deck so I thought it was worth updating the list at least.</b>

No seriously, Ancient Gears have some rather good synergy with Trains since both decks are entirely EARTH Machines and both archetypes have a lot of generic support for EARTH Machines, not just Railway or Ancient Gears specifically. Ancient Gear Ballista is the core combo card of this Deck, pretty much the entire Main Deck is built to swarm Ballista out as much as possible since he can be summoned with any 2 EARTH Machines, not just Ancient Gears. Trains also open the deck to the Rank 10 XYZs. Gustav Max + Howitzer burn on top of all that battle damage? Yes please!

<strong>MAIN DECK</strong>

<strong><a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a></strong>
Three copies. You always want to be seeing this guy. If you control all EARTH Machines it can Special Summon itself for free, and during the end-phase it returns a Machine in your GY to your hand if it was sent there that turn, which is more useful than it seems, and it triggers during your opponent’s end phase if sent to the GY during their turn as well. Use <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>’s effect to Special Summon it during their turn, detach it from your R10 XYZs or tribute it for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a>'s nuke effect and return whatever you think you'll need for your turn. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a>'s search effect will activate if added back from the GY by <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> too, giving you access to double the resources for next turn. Trigger this effect as often as you can, obviously.

<strong><a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Heavy Freight Train Derricrane</a></strong>
Two copies. Free Special Summon if you summon another EARTH Machine. If detached from a R10 XYZ it can pop a card. Mostly used as the free summon to get <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> out. However, it makes <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a>’s phat burn or <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>'s quick effect to protect itself a little bit more powerful.

<strong><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a></strong>
Now at two copies since the original post. I've added a lot more ways to get rid of it from the hand and Deck. Since it’s not as likely to sit in your hand forever I think two copies can work now as the Deck is a lot better once <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in the mix, and I do want to see it more often than I did. You don't really want to draw it, but if you do, <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>, <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a>, <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a> help to get it out of there and on to the field or GY where it's useful. Prioritise getting him to the GY as fast as possible. Get him out of the Deck with <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> or <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a>. It's also worth noting <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is level 10 which makes him a prime candidate to go into the R10 XYZs but make sure to detach him first so you're still covered by his Special Summon effect in the GY. You can also use that effect to chain block <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s effect when that's triggered at the same time. ALSO, you can combo his monster nuke effect with <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> since that can Special Summon <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> during the opponent's turn and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> can tribute it off making use of its’ high ATK, and you can return an EARTH Machine during the end-phase off <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>'s effect as well. Keep the pressure up!!

You can use this to dodge effects and other disruption too.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</a></strong>
One copy, down from 2. The loss of VFD means there's no real use in running two anymore, too many big machines means too many bricky machines. You won’t be able to use the first Reactor to pop another <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> and go for a second Reactor, but that trade in power is worth the increase in consistency. Not having one at all limits <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>’s effectiveness and your power ceiling too heavily. He'll still does most of the heavy hitting and can be brought out ""easily"" with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s effect to pop <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or after <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> is destroyed. If you still control <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> (or any other Machine), I usually go into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> during MP2. 3000 ATK beatsticks with no protection don't do much for you nowadays during the opponent's turn, at least <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> can recycle <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> for advantage off his effect during their turn and set you up again for your next turn.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a></strong>
Two copies. I tried three, but that was too many. If added to your hand outside of being drawn, you can search for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> or my personal favourite new target: Infinitrack Anchor Drill (500 DEF Wooo!). This Deck can trigger <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>'s effects. Use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> to gather more resources to fuse with, set up for the next turn with <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> or search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> out to discard a <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> stuck in your hand being useless and trade it for an <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a>. *whispers* It's free card advantage.

<strong>*Deep Breath** <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede</a></strong>
Three copies. If summoned, this card summons another EARTH Machine from your GY, which is pretty much any monster in the Deck. Ideally, target <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> if you have it to trigger its’ recycle effect during the end-phase, otherwise any monster will do. <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> can then recycle <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> and you can do it all over again. This is essentially a card to make <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> with, or if you use its’ second effect you can go into the R10 XYZs by copying the level of another monster you control, either <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>, <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>. This guy infinitely comboing with <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> is the reason I play 2 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> over 2 <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>.

<strong><a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a></strong>
Brand new addition to the deck! Three copies! This card is so good, I totally missed it when building the original Deck (thanks PurpleJesus7). If summoned, this card Special Summons another EARTH Machine from your hand, and DOES NOT negate its' effects. It's a one card <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>, it yeets <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> right out of your hand and gives you access to spicy <a data-name=""Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu</a> plays thanks to its’ second effect of level manipulation shenanigans, similar to <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern</a>
</strong>Three copies. The ye olde searcher for any Ancient Gear card you want, except itself. It does have an annoying drawback which prevents you from Setting any cards for the rest of the turn after you use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>'s effect, apparently searching <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> and setting it that turn was too OP. Remember to Set all the backrow you want to use during your opponent's turn <strong>before</strong> searching with this card. I tend to Set all my cards before I start my combos, just in case. It’s a bad habit in any other situation other than this one. Search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> for another search (<a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern </a>searches <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>!?), <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> for protection, or search whatever you want- I'm not your dad.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Ancient Gear Frame</a></strong>
One copy, down from two. It was already mostly there for the name, I cut it back due to the lack of room in the Deck but kept one for the discard (for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>) that comes in handy once in a blue moon, and it is a target for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> when you need the materials for <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a>. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a> can discard a card and search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a> (since it lists Ancient Gear Golem in its' card text). It does have other effects but we don't run either Golem or Ultimate Pound because bricks (:pepehands:), so those effects, whilst good- are irrelevant. It's an okay card, but if you want room for more trains or something else you want to splash, this card is probably the one to cut.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Ancient Gear Hunting Hound</a></strong>
Two copies. Three is too many. Burns for 600 on Normal Summon and has a “Poly” effect that can Fusion Summon either <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a>. I don't need to explain why he's in here or what I do with him.

<strong><a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a>
</strong>Another new addition. Two copies. This card is just another <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> for <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>, and it's an EARTH Machine so you can still Special Summon your Trains off Scrap’s summon, and go into <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> after you've dumped <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> to the GY. It can also dump <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> to the GY if you already have <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a>. I've not once used its' recycle effect but it's there if you want to recycle a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> and <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> for a DRAWW MONSTA CARDO!!

<strong><a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a></strong>
Three copies (now affordable for all you budget players!!). This is your power card, this is, and I repeat, this is NOT <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a> bait. <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> Special Summons 2 monsters of choice from the Deck, one high-level and one low-level monster, if your opponent controls more monsters than you do. Always pick <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> as the high-level monster if he isn't already in the GY, otherwise pick <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> or <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>, situation depending. Usually, I pick <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> as the low-level monster if I intend to recycle it off <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> that turn or if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> is not already in circulation. Otherwise, <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> are both good targets to get in circulation. If you already have everything you want in circulation summon either <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is already in the GY (or is also being summoned off <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>) since he’s pretty useless otherwise, or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Hunting Hound</a> as a last choice.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a></strong>
Down to two copies from three. The Deck's core strategy is moving away from Fusion Summoning due to better access to <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> plays, so this card isn't as important to see in your first hand. If you need it, just search it off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Frame</a>. It's a poly, that's it really. It's got redundant/irrelevant Golem effects which we don't use. It can't be responded to if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is face-up, which is pretty cool. This card makes <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> 99% of the time. 1 in 100 games you might go into <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> if you've got the materials to spare or your opponent has no outs to it. However, the threat of being able to go into <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant at any time will keep your opponent on edge. </a>

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Ancient Gear Fortress</a></strong>
Two copies. Your opponent cannot respond to your Ancient Gear effects and Ancient Gear monsters you control cannot be targeted or destroyed the turn they’re summoned. Amazing. ""Response? Yes? TOO BAD BITCH FORTRESS SAY NO"" - actually me one time. The single best support card for Ancient Gears since <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>. Although in this Deck it manly protects your <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> plays rather than blanket protect your entire fucking Deck since we play a mix of other archetypes' cards. Purer builds should always run three. It's still incredibly good at protecting your main combo piece, and it's also got the signature Ancient Gear pop-float (only in the S/T zone, so no Magical Hats shenanigans this time), but it locks you to Ancient Gears for the turn (No <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Anger Knuckle or </a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max in the MP2, remember that)</a>. I don’t recommend destroying it with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>, but if you have nothing else it’ll do. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is also an amazing card to bait the opponent’s negates with, they'll know that if they don't negate or destroy this card, they won't be able to stop anything else you do for the rest of the turn (not necessarily true, but I imagine that's what they're thinking since it gets negated A LOT). It doesn't stop your opponent to responding to the resolution of an Ancient Gear effects though, keep that in mind. It also doesn't stop the opponent from negating <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or its' effect since it isn't an ""Ancient Gear"" card, for some reason. Always Set your <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>s folks.

<strong><a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>
</strong>Otherwise known as ""Kaboom Town*"" since it literally never survives on the field for more than a turn. Two copies, down from three. Searched off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> and then almost always immediately blown up by it too. I wouldn't want to live there. You don't<em> always </em>have to summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a> off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, sometimes Special Summoning <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> for the search can help more in the long run (or to push for a <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant)</a>, or summoning <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> from the GY (or Megaton Golem if you play him), even better if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in your GY for suicide shenanigans.

<strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong>
Three copies. Yes, I know it's a $100+ card but I already own three copies so I put <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>s in here because this is my Deck after all and they’re really good disruption, keeping your monsters alive and good at getting <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> out of your hand if he's chilling in there etc. etc. It's a great card, you don't need me to tell you that or how to use it. For budget players: try out <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash,</a> or more <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called Bys</a> if it wasn't always taking a tour bus through the forbidden and limited realms. If you're feeling more ""A good defence is a good offence"", try out some generic 'going second' cards like <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler </a>(which is better? No damage or no board?), <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, </a>or an assortment of Kaijus and the like.

<strong><a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></strong>
Because fuck you <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>.

<strong><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong>
Limited to one. Used to dump <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> to the GY where he belongs. If starting out with only <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>, you can dump a target to the GY to use it as a target for <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>' effect. It can bait a negate if you're trying to get <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> off and it also dumps targets (<a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a>) for <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> to recycle, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to Special Summon (if you're desperate), or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> for next turn plays (if you're even more desperate).

<strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong>
Limited to one. It does what it does. This Deck needs all the combo extenders it can get. Besides, your GY is usually full of massive beatsticks or annoying <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>s, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Reborn</a> comes in handy.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a></strong>
One copy, although I played around with two. Our one and only Trap Card. It's okay, but it's a little slow. I run just the one because <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> can search it when summoned during the opponent's turn and you'll be able to Set it during your turn. It is kinda nifty though; you can chain the effect to <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> (if it tributes itself and you control no monsters thereafter) and/or <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> to get double the monsters. Just listen to the satisfying sound of your opponent's life points dropping constantly as you reborn <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> over and over again.

<strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Ancient Gear Howitzer</a></strong>
Two copies, down from three. The bread-and-butter Ancient Gear fusion monster. Probably one of the most annoying cards for your opponent to deal with. It burns, floats, AND is immune to all other card effects. Its' Floaty Mc. Float Face effect isn't once per turn (Its' burn effect is though). You can suicide this into bigger monsters and Special Summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon</a> (or any Ancient Gear) from the Deck to do the hittin' <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> couldn't. If <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in your GY you'll also get to summon him off <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s suicide, which also chain blocks <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a>'s float (or vise-versa).

<strong><a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant</a></strong>
One copy. This is your Hulk Smash, a fucking MASSIVE beatstick that will almost always end the game if your opponent can't deal with it. He’ll do what Hulk did to Loki to your unfortunate opponent at the other end of the stick. <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> is totally immune to Spells and Traps, but vulnerable to monster effects (God, I wish it were the other way around). Although he’s much better protected with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> up, if you need a big beatstick, you don't get bigger than this. Well, no, that's not quite true, you do, but it can't attack multiple times like <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> can... oh wait, it does that too!?? It's okay though, this deck runs both.

<strong><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear Ballista</a></strong>
The Deck Master. Three copies. This card searches <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> or any Ancient Gear monster, then, in the case of <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, immediately blows it up and makes one of your opponent's monsters ATK/DEF 0, making hitting them over the head with a 3000 ATK beatstick that much more satisfying. He's also an Ancient Gear (I forget that sometimes) so once you've done your things you can use him as material for a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or LINK <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> off into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> for railway shenanigans, it's a waste to just leave him out there, he doesn't really do anything for you during your opponent's turn.

Consider running <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa</a> to make use of <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>’s LINK 2 rating and whatever’s left on your field. Apollo with two or three negates is still fairly good.

<strong><a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a></strong>
One copy, two if you're feeling it. He can summon your level 10s from the GY, or himself, which comes in handy a lot, and comes in CLUTCH when you're top decking because literally any card you draw can do the '<a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> into <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> into a <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> field nuke' wombo-combo. You can use this effect to dodge other targeting or disruptive effects too. High priority to get into circulation if <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> is in the GY, if not, constantly making use of <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a>’s recycle is still really, really good.

<strong><a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a>
</strong>I added one copy to the Deck just for some turn 1 plays since the Deck doesn't really have any. You can't use <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista, </a>and ending on just <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> or <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> isn't exactly a fantastic unbreakable board. Its effect isn’t as useful with LINKS since they can't be turned to Defence and negated, but it still stops a lot of plays dead in their tracks, which is good enough really.

<strong><a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>
</strong>Added one copy to the Deck for generic backrow removal since the Deck doesn't have much besides whatever is in the Side Deck at the time and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>. Consider running a <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">AA-ZEUS instead as it'll probably be more useful (I'd run it if I owned it).</a>

<strong><a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a></strong>
One copy. Generic Rank 4 with some good protection and supports trains (despite it being a ship). If it ends up destroying something, you can overlay into <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> for a phat 2k burn, or into <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> for a big beatstick/wall that can be rather annoying for the opponent to remove, and if you're really feeling it: overlay, overlay, overlay into a 4 or 5 material <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">AA-ZEUS</a>.

<strong><a data-name=""Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star</a></strong>
One copy, two if you're feeling it/find the room. <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> gave us access to Rank 7s and 8s and this is probably the best Rank 8 around. If you don't like it (and why wouldn't you) feel free to use something else like Number 11: Big Eye (target a Level 3 with <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a>’s effect) or whatever.

<strong>**Deep Breath** <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</a></strong>
What's with this ridiculously long name?? One copy. Personally, I prefer 2 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> but you can swap the ratios if you want to, both works. This is for those times when <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> is too vulnerable or you want to keep some of your monsters alive and effects their working. While good at both being a giant beatstick and gargantuan wall, he can also protect the vulnerable <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> if you plan on summoning it this turn. Detaching for the effect also triggers <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> (the latter in the end-phase) making <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> a lot more appealing over <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav </a> sometimes.

<strong>**Deeeeeep Breath** <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a></strong>
One copy, and another stupidly long name, but he makes up for that ridiculous name with its sheer FUCKING POWER, <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>’s cannon isn't just for show. If you thought <a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Giant</a> was a beast, imagine <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> as his more successful, cooler, sexier, and stronger cousin. Overlay this over <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> or <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> after you've used either of their effects (or you if you haven't and want to attack more times). You can detach a material to have <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> gain a permanent 2k ATK, bringing it up to 6000, then 8k the next turn (if it's still alive or you haven't already won). It can always attack a number of times on monster equal to its’ materials +1. That's 3 attacks, four if you didn't use Gustav's/<a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a>'s effect. Use him to clear the board and if you haven't used <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>'s effect, let the rest of your monsters attack directly for fucking insane damage. This card is a powerhouse even by Machine standards, and does most of the work for the deck. Must include. Get one. They're cheap now too.

<strong><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a></strong>
Two copies. Some good, sweet burn damage that puts Dragoon to shame (Okay, that's a lie but Gustav at least looks 50x cooler- only if it's the LART we're talking about). I find myself going into this card a lot, burning my opponent, then either overlaying to <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> or LINKing it off for <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> or <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>. Gustav’s 2k burn on top of a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> burn, and the awesome battle damage these machines can dish makes for """"EZ"""" OTKs. Your opponent won't survive more than a few turns if they aren't careful. A <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav burn and a direct attack from </a><a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe is exactly 8k damage.</a>

<strong>The 1 2 3s and ABCs (A.ncient B.eatsticks C.an S.mash)
</strong>[Below was written with the original Deck in mind, it's still relevant and informative but it could be a bit better, but I'm not gonna rewrite all this. Use that big brain of yours to figure out where the new cards fit in]

The main focus of the deck is to bring out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> as fast as possible. The R10 XYZs are a nice addition and work well together with AG but they shouldn't be your main focus or win-con.

Say your starting hand is AG Fusion, <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent </a><a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a>, AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>. You go second (this is a board-breaker deck after all) and draw <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>. A typical combo (for now I'm not going to factor in negates/disruption etc.) might look like this...

Activate <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a>, Special Summon <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina </a><a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. You already have <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>; you don't need more AGs. Get whatever you want/lack into circulation. You Special Summoned an EARTH Machine. Special Summon from your hand <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>. Set <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a>, THEN Normal Summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>. Search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> and then activate it right away. XYZ <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> using <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> and <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>, detach <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> and burn your opponent for 2k. <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a>'s effect activates and pops a card. If you're going first, summon <a data-name=""Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> instead, assuming you can Normal Summon and you have either <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> or <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> in your hand. Or <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> etc.

Link Summon AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> using <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. If you don't have another monster to normal summon, use Gustav. Search <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, then activate <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> and use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s effect to pop it and make a monster your opponent controls ATK/DEF 0. If you didn't have <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> at this point, summon it off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, otherwise summon <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>. If you were going first ignore most of the above and just summon <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a>. First turn you should prioritize getting as many fusion materials as you can and thinning out the deck as fast as possible, going second you can afford to be more aggressive and go for the beatsticks more.

Use AG Fusion and summon AG <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> using <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> and either the monster he searched for or one you had in your hand already/the <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> (don't use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor</a>) you summoned off <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>. Burn your opponent for 1k. You can then choose to Overlay Gustav into <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>. If all you need is one solid hit, detach <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> from <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> and smack the 0/0'd monster that <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> targeted for game, since <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a> is on 6k and you've burned for 3k so far. Otherwise if you don't detach it's just a solid 1k ATK upgrade over Gustav that can attack monsters three times! Plus all your other monsters can attack too if you didn't use <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Liebe</a>'s effect.

So it's time for the fun part. The Battle Phase. Always attack with the Ancient Gears first since your opponent can't activate Spell and Traps (monster effects only if attacking with <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a>, both if attacking with Reactor) until the end of the damage step. Use Reactor to pop either one of their backrow or another <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> if you have one, don't always pop <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a>, it has good protection effects that are best left active, unless you need just one more hit. If you're lucky enough for there to be a monster greater than 1000ATK feel free to suicide <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> straight into that. That will summon another AG from the Deck, and the effect can't be negated if <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fortress"">Fortress</a> is up. If you have <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in the GY, he will special summon itself too since <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> is an EARTH Machine and it was just destroyed.

If somehow your opponent survived your onslaught either through major disruption or magic bullshittery, go into MP2, you're not done. If you went into Leibe for the battle phase, detach <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> now for Leibe's effect. Other monsters can't attack for the rest of the turn, but they weren't going to anyway. This puts <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> in the GY giving you some protection. LINK Summon <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> using whatever's at hand, if you haven't used <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> this turn, summon it now off <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a>.

For the most part, that's it you're done. If you went first you have a 4k defence wall that can make itself immune to card effects and if it has <a data-name=""Heavy Freight Train Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> as a material, it can also pop a card. Maybe a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> or <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a> too. If you went second you smashed your opponent so hard he didn't know what hit him. If you didn't already win you should soon. Assuming you weren't negated and disrupted at every corner, then your board will be much less impressive and your opponent won't be bleeding from every morsel. This summary assumes a lot, a real game is very different. If someone slaps down <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a> or <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a>, you're fucked. Make sure to prepare an appropriate Side-Deck suited to your locals. I recommended at least 2 <a data-name=""Twin-Twisters"">Twin-Twisters</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>Tips and Little Tricks</strong>
If you activated <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Schedule</a> and have <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> in hand. Link away into <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> before you summon <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a>. That way <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Pegasus</a> can target <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>'s materials in grave and Link into <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> or use it's other effect to XYZ into one of the Railway Cannons or the <a data-name=""Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid"">Dreadnought Dreadnoid</a>.

If you summoned <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> off a <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> pop or a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> float during your opponent's turn, search <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reborn"">Ancient Gear Reborn</a> (if you want to) since you can set it during your turn unlike normally when <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Wyvern</a> locks you out from Setting cards for the rest of the turn, which doesn't matter during your opponent's turn.

After <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> has attacked you can nuke your opponent's monsters by tributing itself and attack directly with the rest of your monsters. <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Citadel</a> can revive itself again next turn if your opponent destroys one of your monsters.

If <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a> is destroyed on summon but his effect will still resolve, search out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> instead of <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a>, since <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown</a> is useless without <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ballista</a>. <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Box</a> should search <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> and set you up for the next turn.

Just because you know you're out of <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Reactor Dragon</a>s in the Deck, or any decent targets for a <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> float, doesn't mean your opponent knows that. Sitting on a bluffing <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Howitzer"">Howitzer</a> has worked for me sometimes.

<a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">If Bullet Train</a> summoned off <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> during your opponent's turn wasn't destroyed that turn, it still has its' effects negated during your turn. It can attack and you won't have to send 2 cards you control to the GY to do so.

Anyway that's about it I guess. If I think of more things I'll add them later (and I never did lol).

Grind out advantage and wipe your opponents board on their main phase as needed.

Pot of Duality as our card draw of choice. It doesn't provide actual card advantage like Extravagance or Desires, but our deck needs specific cards more than it needs a lot of cards. Extravagance is a nonbo with a lot of our other card draw effects, and Desires wiping random cards from our deck is much too steep a cost to pay here. Thankfully we don't special summon much, so Pot of Duality slots in quite well.

This deck plays a lot like an old school control deck and is very budget friendly to boot. We don't really use our extra deck much beyond the occasional Linkuriboh or Link-2 off of Crackdown. Fossil Warrior Skull Knight and Elder Entity N'tss are really just tech cards for Dogmatika.

Main Attribute, Type: Earth, Machine

The primary strategy of the deck is to go second and OTK with your high attack machines. Juggernaut Liebe and Gustav Max are your main ways of dealing high amounts of damage along with attack boosting cards like Limiter Removal. The infinitrack Xyzs are to be used as toolbox options and also to rank-up into your OTK enablers through Outrigger Extension. When forced to go first, the deck can still hold it's ground by setting up some combination of Super Dora, Megaclops, Outrigger Extension, and Infinitrack Goliath being used as Xyz material. 3 copies of limiter removal can be swapped out for other cards if desired (handtraps are recommended). The Xyz ratios of the Extra Deck can also be tailored to personal preference."

1 Card combo or 2 Card Combo:

Just summon <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> or if you don't have it, <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a> and <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a> are enough to make a full combo, that you will find in the video below, because it is easier to show you.

<strong><em>Tips and Tricks</em></strong>:

Try to summon an extra monster initially or later to summon <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> so you don't have to waste the effect of <a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a>.

If you have <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a> in the graveyard and you control a plant monster, activate the effect to return it to your hand, so that you have a discard card for <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""World Carrotweight Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a>.

In the deck there are some handtrap lightning rods like <a data-name=""Rose Princess"">Rose Princess</a>, <a data-name=""White Rose Cloister"">White Rose Cloister</a>, <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> and then <a data-name=""Dotscaper"">Dotscaper</a> but also <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>. Which are useful but not necessary extenders and therefore can be sacrificed and then left free to the starters.

It's a deck that i love, i think it's one of my most successful lists, is a deck that with some other support could be really interesting even to be part of the sea of ​​rogue decks.

Very balanced and consistent it is difficult to brick. If it doesn't suffer too much negations, it's if it has ""handtrap lightning rods"", even with bad hands, he can get by fairly well.

<strong>The Cards</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> is a really good card, it does not say once per turn and allows us to summon any plant monster from the deck, we will mainly use it to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a> and <a data-name=""Spore"">Spore</a>.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a> is our main extender which is also a tuner which can be very useful in some situations. Also it can come back in hand which is great for summoning <a data-name=""World Carrotweight Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a>.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a> is a Field Spell that we can use in 2 ways, the first is to exploit the tokens to cover ourselves in defense by halving the attack of the opposing monsters and the second is to give plant tokens to summon a monster from the gy, which is a effect that most of the time i didn't need to activate.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> is a really good card that we can use both in our turn, often to summon <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> which allows us to add the <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> trap, and in our opponent's turn by giving a token created by <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a> to summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"">Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</a>.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a>, we go to use it mainly when we start with <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a> and <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a>, and we need it to summon <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> and then start the combo.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>The Combos and Final Board:</strong></span></p>
It's a deck that prefers to go first, because it bothers the opponent a lot as well as the board for <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>, starting first without too many negations and with a normal hand it manages to make the combo and often to win, then thanks to the side deck he adapts very well to our opponent giving up slightly to the power of the final board.
<p>The board of a full combo is made up of:</p>
<p><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>, <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a> + <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> and <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td><span>Side Deck</span></td>

</table>
<p><strong>Must Have</strong>:</p>
<a data-name=""Dark Ruler no More"">Dark Ruler no More</a> is a staple going second too strong not to be played, perfect board breaker.

<a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> very useful in this deck since we have several effects, which are activated by cost leaving the field free and therefore allow us to activate gamma in response to hand trap.

<a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> it is the perfect hand trap being earth and therefore can be used in the cemetery to summon <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a> or <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the disaster</a>.

<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> against the control decks it's perfect, Konami put it at 1 and therefore we use it.

<a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> this card is also against controls or decks that use different traps including <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>.
<p><a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> obviously is to be played and is the replacement for <a data-name=""Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"">Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</a>.</p>


<hr />
<p><b>Other cards that may be useful:</b></p>
<p>The following cards replace <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Muddy Mudragon"">Muddy Mudragon</a>.
We are going to remove these cards, because we summon them at the end of the board and against some opponents they are difficult to summon. And let's insert cards that make us play and can allow us to get out of some uncomfortable situations. We are going to play them, in those duels in which we know we cannot do full combo.</p>
<a data-name=""Traptrix Allomerus"">Traptrix Allomerus</a> is not super easy to summon, but it has both great effects. We can use it in our turn to get out of some bad situations using the first effect or we can use it in the opponent's turn in combo with <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> and <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram</a>.

<a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a> Same speech as the Traptrix, we use it to get out of some complicated situations.

<strong>The Deck:</strong>

The Blue-Eyes Invoked Deck is not bad, maybe it can still be fixed a little bit but it already has good stability. Thanks to the Invoked engine and the access to ranks 8 by Blue-eyes cards we find ourselves a nice control deck but also aggro.

<strong>The Cards:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> is the key to the deck with which we add <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> in the hand and we go to summon <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>.<img class=""alignright"" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//c/cc/GalaxyEyesCipherExDragon-SLT1-JP-OP.png"" alt=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon"" width=""180"" height=""263"" />

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> gives us access to <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>, playing almost all monsters of light attribute, including hand traps, it is very easy to summon it by activating its effect.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Nebula Dragon"">Nebula Dragon</a> is useful to more easily summon 2 levels 8, as well as being an additional <a data-name=""Trade-in"">Trade-in</a> target.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon</a> is a very useful pre-release currently ocg support, covering the monsters of attribute light. And in the next standby phase it allows us to return the <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</a> in the extra deck and then immediately afterwards, summon it on top of Cipher Ex.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Board</strong>:</p>
Usually <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> we always manage to summon him, besides him it would be great to be able to summon <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon</a>, if we have <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> in hand we can opt to summon <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Dragon Infinity"">Cyber ​​Dragon Infinity</a>.
<table>

<tr>
<td><strong><span>Side Deck</span></strong></td>
</tr>

</table>
The side deck is mainly focused on 3 things.

In the first case we have simple cards that are the substitute for others, such like <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>.

In the second we have cards useful against other decks or generic staples, like <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>.

And in the third and last we have, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with and attached cards.
<p><b>-</b></p>
<p><img class=""alignright"" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/1/11/TrueKingofAllCalamities-MYFI-EN-SR-1E.png/300px-TrueKingofAllCalamities-MYFI-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt=""True King of All Calamities"" width=""180"" height=""265"" /></p>
<a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> is great side card 'cause it's a dragon monster target of <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a> and allows you to draw 1 or more cards and is can be used at the end of the board as an extra negation.

<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> excellent card that cleans us the magic and traps section.

<a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a> can be the replacement for <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> or <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> and it's very useful to draw 2 which in this deck is worth a lot, since we need cards in hand, or discard a card in the opponent's hand.

<a data-name=""True King of all Calamities"">True King of all Calamities</a> is too strong a card not to be played, it's not very easy to summon and that's why I keep it sideways.

In 1 turn, you can put up 2-3 negates, and powerful monsters as well. However, if you brick, it won't end well, and this deck can easily brick. So, in my deck, i put in a lot of draw cards, in order to draw the pieces you need in the combo.

If you don't know how to play, i recommend watching youtube video about how to combo properly, like <a>this</a> and <a>this</a>!. Good luck dueling, and have fun!"
