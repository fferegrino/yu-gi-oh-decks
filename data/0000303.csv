It is relatively cheap to make if you exclude the Side Deck.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BLS can be very situationally useful as it cannot be targeted by card effects (Red Supernova and Red Nova can't be destroyed by card effects but CAN be targeted and thus negated, banished, or returned to hand/deck).</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;<span>Main</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Extra Deck</span>&nbsp;is what I am&nbsp;<span>currently running/what got me to Plat 1</span>. The Side Deck is full of staples I think would be beneficial to add&nbsp;<span>if you already have them,&nbsp;</span>they are not necessary for the deck to work properly!&nbsp;<a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>&nbsp;plus&nbsp;<a href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Nibiru%2C+the+Primal+Being"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>&nbsp;are probably the most helpful as the go-to combo often has 5 or more summons.&nbsp;<a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave&nbsp;&quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;"">&nbsp;can also be useful in some situations but keep in mind it can't be used to make&nbsp;</a><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave&nbsp;&quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;"">.</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>Strategy</span></span></p><p><br /><span><span>ALWAYS USE CRIMSON RESONATOR'S EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING ELSE!!</span></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always go first if able. Ideal end board is solo&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a>&nbsp;(made with Chaos Ruler) with 1 or more&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reigns </a>set and a Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. This way you have 1 (faceup card) omni negate and 2 potential board nukes or 1 nuke and an invincible 6000 ATK Monster . THE KEY IS TO WAIT until your opponent is almost finished with their combo OR attempts to banish, negate, or return to hand Supernova Dragon before using Red Reign in order to maximize its effect.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>&nbsp;is the backbone of this deck and allows it to fairly easily beat Tri Brigade, Sky Striker, Virtual World, etc so long as you go first due to its non-targeting banish and its ability to make Red Supernova Dragon unaffected by card effects (very few decks can hit above 6,000+ ATK and even if they can you can nuke their field with Red Supernova's on attack declaration quick effect). Use it every turn because odds are you will be able to return it to hand. For this reason I want to add Trap Trick to this deck for the frustrating occasions when it isn't in the top 10 cards of the deck.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you successfully did full first-turn combo (Red Supernova Dragon on the field with Chaos Ruler, 1 Light, and 1 Dark in GY) don't be afraid to use Supernova's effect that banishes it for cost, because you have a guaranteed Chaos Ruler plus whatever combos you still have in hand for the next turn while your opponent has likely used most of their cards.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nibiru and Ash Blossom are problems, but usually your Nibiru will be more powerful than your opponent's and if you managed to get Chaos Ruler and 1 Light in the GY you can bring him back and continue comboing or go into BLS. Also, usually you can combo through and bait out Ash because of how many search and special summon from hand effects are in this deck. This deck can also gamble on the Maxx ""C"" challege and&nbsp; pull through okay as long as your opponent isnt running Kaijus&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>Boss Monsters</span></span></p><p><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Legit one of the best trap cards in the whole game when used in this deck. It non-targeting banishes all monsters except those with the highest level, so if you have Lv. 12 Red Supernova Dragon out on the field it's a full nuke. This is the main reason why you want to go first. BUT ITS BEST EFFECT IS THAT IT CAN RECYCLE INFINITELY by adding it to hand from GY when you synchro summon. All your Extra Deck monsters but 1 are DARK Dragon Synchro monsters, so this just happens automatically in your combos. <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>&nbsp;synergizes with this card perfectly, as it gives you 5 extra chances at ""drawing""&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>. Also, Chaos Ruler's GY effect means you can pretty much always synchro summon again on your Second Turn.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, it makes your&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a> into a nearly impenetrable wall of ATK by making it unaffected by your opponent's card effects for 1 turn. If you use this card at the right time, it can easily guarantee a win. Lets also not miss the fact that this card's board nuke effect IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE USE PER TURN. So if you have 1 Red Reign in hand and 1 gets sent to the GY by Chaos Ruler during the combo, you have 2 board nukes and the ability to chain the invincibility effect if your opponent can react to the first. For this reason you can add Trap Trick to increase the likelyhood of drawing it if you don't have all the handtraps/UR staples listed.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go-to boss monster. On average 6,000 ATK when summoned on first turn. Can't be destroyed by card effects, but CAN BE TARGETED &gt; use Red Reign to make up for this weakness. On monster effect or attack declaration it can BANISH ALL CARDS YOUR OPPONENT CONTROLS, yes that means spells and traps too! (it also comes back to your field at the end of your nest End Phase). Wish it had an animation though.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worse version of Red Supernova Dragon, but still an absolute beatstick. No board nuke quick effect, but still unable to be destroyed by card effect (can still be targeted though). MAIN THING TO REMEMBER is that to make Red Nova you HAVE TO USE Red Dragon Archfiend or Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Low-Key has the most OP effect in the entire game &gt; STOPS YOUR OPPONENT FROM ACTIVATING ALL CARD EFEFCTS FOR ONE TURN! This absolutely destroys Dragonmaids and other decks with lots of Battle Phase or On Attack effects, as well as trap heavy decks that get too greedy and wait for your boss monster to come out (your opponent cannot react to this effect with card effects).</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Newest addition to the deck, still in testing phase. Adds another nuke and negate to the deck. Nuff said</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Usually only used on your second turn or later. Can sacrifice another monster on the field to bring back another ""Red Dragon Archfiend."" Often you will use one of the free, special summon from hand or GY monsters to do this (Synkron, Creation, Wandering King, Chaos Ruler). This also works well with its ability to summon 2 tuners (1 from deck and 1 from GY) after doing damage.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go-to negate for the deck, works on all card effects used ON THE FIELD (can't negate GY or hand effects). Works pretty well as a replacement for Red Supernova Dragon if you brick and can't summon it SO LONG AS YOU HAVE RED REIGN. Summons a tuner from your GY after if does damage &gt; this often means you can get some extra combos in Main Phase 2. Synchro summoning this monster is an easy way to get&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>&nbsp;back on your Second Turn as there are 7 Lv. 1 tuners in the deck and if you got the proper First Turn combo you should be able to get&nbsp;<a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler</a>&nbsp;back from the GY.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Main Lv. 8 Synchro Dark Dragon you will be using for combo purposes. Its ability to come back from the GY by banishing 1 Dark and 1 Light monster from the GY makes it great synchro fodder and bait for negates. Its on-summon excavate ability is doubly useful as it can provide extra combos and get a Red Reign in the GY (which will be returned to hand when you use Chaos Ruler to synchro another Dark Dragon). The real MVP of the deck.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just a better version of Red Dragon Archfiend. Go-to when making Red Nova Dragon. Its effect to destroy all special summoned monsters with less or equal ATK can be very useful, and you can always use it as synchro fodder after activating this effect.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Good defensive wall if you happen to brick and can only get out a Lv. 8. It can also become a pretty strong beatstick in certain situations and punishes opponents for using burn strategies that don't OTK.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Classic, but kinda trash. Its ability to destroy all Defense Position monsters can be situationally useful, but its secondary effect can backfire significantly and precludes any Main Phase 2 combos. Still useful for making Red Nova Dragon though.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Basically an anti-brick measure by making Wandering King more useful in-hand. Can make Red Supernova Dragon if you also have Crimson Resonator (just pick 2 Lv.2's instead of 2 Lv.1's). Can also use it to get a massive Life Point boost by bringing back Red Resonator and targeting your 6,000+ ATK Red Supernova Dragon.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Situationally very useful due to the fact it cant be targeted by card effects (this covers the weakness of Red Supernova and Red Nova). You won't always be able to summon it though because some of the combo cards limit you to Synchro or Dark Dragon monsters only for 1 turn.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br />Psy-Framegear Gamma</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This card is a free Chaos Ruler if used on your turn (usually by baiting Ash Blossom with Resonator Call, Emergency Teleport, or Wandering King Wildwind's effect in GY). It can also be searched by Chaos Ruler's effect and used as a LIGHT target for Chaos Ruler's GY effect. This card in hand also works well with Red Reign and Red Supernova Dragon's effects by letting you use them more agressively (once you clear most of your own board with Red Reign and use Red Supernova's effect to banish itself and your opponent's field, Gamma becomes live and can be used to negate any follow up).<br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>Combo Cards</span></span></p><p><br /><span><a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great for making&nbsp;<a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>&nbsp;or as fodder for&nbsp;<a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a>'s effect. Second effect is great for letting you set up Second Turn combos based on what you have in-hand.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Chain Resonator"">Chain Resonator</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CARD! The 2 copies of this card are the ONLY 2 Light monsters in this deck, which you need for&nbsp;<a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>'s effect. THEREFORE, YOU NEED AS MANY COPIES OF THIS CARD AS YOU HAVE OF CHAOS RULER! Its normal summon effect can be very helpful for many Second Turn combos, and being Lv. 1 it can make&nbsp;<a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1-Card combo. Usually select&nbsp;<a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a>&nbsp;the first time you use its summon effect (just read combos) but once the combo is set up, select&nbsp;<a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>&nbsp;because it basically guarantees you can special summon&nbsp;<a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>&nbsp;next turn.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great backup combo starter. Even better backup secondary effect (on special summon it lets you gain Life Points based on the ATK of a monster on the field, yes even your 6,000+ ATK&nbsp;<a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a>) for emergency situations. Often a good idea to use its normal summon effect with&nbsp;<a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, because you can make a Lv. 10 that way.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ALWAYS USE THIS CARD'S IN HAND EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING! It is often a good idea to try to bait out&nbsp;<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>&nbsp;by using&nbsp;<a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a>&nbsp;even if you already have Crimson in hand, because if they ash Crimson's second effect rather than Chaos Ruler's effect then you can't make Red Supernova Dragon. It can be a good idea to return it to hand with&nbsp;<a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a>'s effect just in case your board gets cleared because you can then use its full effect on your Second Turn.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Wandering King Wildwind"">Wandering King Wildwind</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its GY effect makes great bait for&nbsp;<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>s or other negates if you already have a combo in hand. Otherwise, it can help you get the card you need. For this reason I often don't select it with Chaos Ruler's effect unless I specifically need it for a combo because then it ends up in the GY. Like all special summon from-hand cards in this deck, makes great fodder for&nbsp;<a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a>'s effect.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Ascator, Dawnwalker</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The backup Lv. 8 synchro option because of its discard cost. It really hurts when this card gets Ash Blossomed so I usually try to use another card first. IF EVER POSSIBLE, DISCARD&nbsp;<a data-name=""RED REIGN"">RED REIGN</a>! You will bring it back to your hand immediately after you use Ascator to synchro summon. A second-best option is&nbsp;<a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a>&nbsp;because it is useless in hand.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great bait for negates, people seem to have a deep fear of searchers. Usually used to get&nbsp;<a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a>&nbsp;in hand.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another great bait option if you have more combos in hand. Great because it saves you normal summoning&nbsp;<a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>.</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>Combos</span></span></p><p><br /><span><span>Main 1st turn combo (if you start with Crimson Resonator or Resonator Call):</span></span><br /><br /><span>(You can always risk it if you have Ascator, Dawnwalker and hope that Chaos Ruler excavates Crimson Resonator --&gt;

A common theme among many of their monsters is they work best when with another monster of the same name. The most simple and powerful example is ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Gazelle"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a><span>"" who sends any ""Salamangreat"" card from the Deck to the GY, and can also Special Summon itself from the hand if a ""Salamangreat"" monster is sent to the GY. Many of the archetype's effects also involve shuffling cards from the GY into the Deck, revival and discarding cards, so manipulation of the GY successfully gives the Deck a lot of potential.</span><br /><br /><span>A key part of the Deck's combos is ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a><span>"", which allows the player to use a ""Salamangreat"" with the same name as a monster being Link Summoned as the entire material. As with the lesser monsters, the boss monsters get stronger when Summoned using a monster with the same name, making ""Sanctuary"" the quickest and easiest way to open up the full potential of the Deck's Link monsters. It can be searched by ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Balelynx"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Balelynx"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Balelynx</a><span>"" to increase consistency, which makes generic Cyberse monsters like ""</span><a title=""Lady Debug"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Debug"" rel=""nofollow"">Lady Debug</a><span>"" and ""</span><a title=""Flame Bufferlo"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Bufferlo"" rel=""nofollow"">Flame Bufferlo</a><span>"" useful to start combos off.</span><br /><br /><span>The main win condition in some builds is to set up a ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Violet_Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a><span>"" Summoned using another copy of itself, which basically guarantees an&nbsp;</span><a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""OTK"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/OTK"" rel=""nofollow"">OTK</a><span>&nbsp;if all its effects resolve. The other Extra Deck monsters can be used to support this strategy, or for supporting the Deck's recursion/battle effects. In more conventional builds, ""Violet Chimera"" can simply used with ""</span><a title=""Fusion of Fire"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"" rel=""nofollow"">Fusion of Fire</a><span>"" and ""</span><a title=""Super Polymerization"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization"" rel=""nofollow"">Super Polymerization</a><span>"" to break up Link-focused boards, particularly deadly in&nbsp;</span><a title=""Mirror Match"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mirror_Match"" rel=""nofollow"">mirror matches</a><span>. The Deck's rarely used Ritual Monster ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Emerald Eagle"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Emerald_Eagle"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Emerald Eagle</a><span>"" provides a finisher/alternate attacker that can clear all the opponent's Special Summoned monsters if Ritual Summoned using an ""Emerald Eagle"" the player controls, and can sacrifice unneeded Link Monsters to get over tough monsters while inflicting heavy&nbsp;</span><a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Burn"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burn"" rel=""nofollow"">Burn</a><span>&nbsp;damage.</span><br /><br /><span>As any modern Deck must, the Spell/Trap lineup of the Deck also has a heavy control element. ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Roar"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Roar</a><span>"" is a powerful&nbsp;</span><a title=""Counter Trap Card"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Counter_Trap_Card"" rel=""nofollow"">Counter Trap Card</a><span>&nbsp;that can negate any monster effect or Spell/Trap card while you control a ""Salamangreat"" Link Monster, that can Set itself from the GY when a ""Salamangreat"" is self-Link Summoned at the cost of banishing itself when it leaves the field. It can also be recovered by ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a><span>"", who can also play a key role in grabbing ""</span><a title=""Fusion of Fire"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"" rel=""nofollow"">Fusion of Fire</a><span>"" or other key Spell/Trap cards from the GY, especially ones sent by ""Gazelle"". Many of these like ""</span><a title=""Will of the Salamangreat"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_the_Salamangreat"" rel=""nofollow"">Will of the Salamangreat</a><span>"", ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Circle"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Circle"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Circle</a><span>"" and ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Rage"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Rage"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Rage</a><span>"" get stronger when a self-Summoned Salamangreat Link Monster is present, so maintaining and protecting a powerful monster like ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Heatleo"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Heatleo"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a><span>"" can reap many rewards, even over a relatively short Duel. ""Sunlight Wolf"" can also recover FIRE monsters from the GY, particularly useful with the staple handtrap ""</span><a title=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_Blossom_%26_Joyous_Spring"" rel=""nofollow"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a><span>"". These attributes of repeated recursion allow the Deck to get a lot of value from playing many on-theme 1-ofs, as they will nearly always be accessible when needed.</span><br /><br /><span>Finally, a key step in setting up these plays is ""</span><a title=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Miragestallio"" rel=""nofollow"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a><span>"", a generic Rank 3 that can Summon any ""Salamangreat"" from the Deck and&nbsp;</span><a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Bounce"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Bounce"" rel=""nofollow"">bounce</a><span>&nbsp;opposing cards on being used as Link Material (Traditional only).

This list takes inspiration from Federico H.C.'s Subterror List (March 2022 CSM Top 16). In this list, I included a few more floodgates and interruption tools to see if I could help the deck's consistency. If you find this deck interesting, or my description helpful, please leave a comment and check out the other Krawler decks in this series.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In each of these Krawler deck breakdowns, I like to talk about what Krawlers do well, what their weaknesses are, and how the other archetype(s) I splash synergize with the deck. Krawlers don't have a great normal summon. Krawler Soma, their most recent addition, is a fantastic special summon, but if you are playing pure Krawlers they often normal a level two in order to activate Soma's effect. Krawlers have a great variety of effects, making them very good at toolboxing scenarios. Krawlers can negate on-field monster effects with Deus X-Krawler, but have difficulty negating or surviving Spell/Trap effects. Subterrors have their own strengths and weaknesses. They usually have very weak extra-deck gameplay, not being able to flood the board very easily. They rely on having a board of face-down monsters to special summon the Subterror Behemoths using their inherent effect. Subterrors do have a great ability to search out Guru and Fiendess from the main deck, which flip other monsters face down and negate card or effect activation respectively. Combining these two archetypes produces a stronger and more cohesive deck than either part on its own. Krawlers, now with Soma, can readily access several extra-deck plays, while Subterrors can negate Spell/Trap effects that Krawlers usually struggle against. Subterrors have an amazing normal summon in Guru, especially if the field spell is in play, and they contain several search cards which are much faster than Krawler's search card (Receptor). Subterror's also benefit from having cards in the GY (Fiendess can summon from GY), which World Legacy Survivor can help with. The other, non-archetypal cards I'm including are here because they benefit both archetypes and promote our game plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is our prefered opening and game plan: we find/draw Soma and The Hidden City. We use The Hidden City to search Subterror Guru, set Guru, and flip-up Guru using City. Use Guru's effect to search out Subterror Final Battle (we will search Subterror Fiendess on the opponent's turn), and summon Krawler Soma by flipping Guru face-down. From here we can make a few strong link monsters and set up a board before passing, or go into Utopic Draco Future with a set Ghostrick Scare, along with the other cards on board. This is what we want going first, but this list is much weaker going second. In the Side Deck I included a few cards that I would like to make work, but couldn't find a use for, but also a few board breakers that we will undoubtedly need going second. Dark Ruler No More is helpful, but we struggle to make Accesscode in one turn, and so perhaps Raigeki or Lightning Storm would be more useful. Also, seval Spright builds have been experimenting with Enemy Controller, and we can take advantage of this card as well! Its especially powerful to activate after we have used a flip-monster's effect, essentially tributing one of our dead cards to take control of one of the opponent's live ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We include Nibiru and Summon Limit as our main deck board breaker and floodgate, respectively. We can search Nibiru off of Small World, and we can use Nibiru to search Soma or Guru using Small World. We play World Legacy Survivor at 2 to lower our chances of drawing more than 1. Subterror Fiendess, usually played at 3, is at 2 in this list. I found myself ending games without using the third Fiendess most of the time, and it is incredibly easy to search. We are playing one-a-piece of Umastryx and Ultramafus. They both have very solid effects, and can be summoned fairly easily in this list, whether we send them to the GY to revive or summon off of Subterror Behemoth Fiendess. Morphing Jar #2 is primarily a Small World bridge, but it can be very effective at wiping a board and summoning face-down monsters for both players, which helps us and slows down our opponent. Subterror Succession is another search tool, and can turn Umastryx or Ultramafus into a Soma or Guru. Calamity Upon the Hidden City is just an excellent card for protecting our set monsters, floating on destruction, and boosting our flipped-face-up cards for game. We play 1 Mind Meld, which could be cut, but I like for openings in which we end on 2 set monsters and Qualiark. Subterror Nemesis Archer can remove hard to destroy monsters, and floats on destruction. Since it is so searchable, it feels fine to include, if a little clunky. A Side Deck card that I wanted to find a place for in the main, but struggle to justify, is Subterror Cave Clash. The recursion is great, but just a little too slow. We usually only have 2 attributes to banish for Accesscode Talker, but you could include another attribute like Pitknight Earlie if you so choose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like a combo guide, I can update this description, but for now I'm just going to give general descriptions of combo lines. Starting with Guru in hand is good, but starting with The Hidden City is much better. The Hidden City or Guru with a flip-enabler like Junk Sleep is a fine opening, though much weaker than one with Soma in hand. Soma enables us to use our extra deck, making an I:P Masquerena that can link with our other monsters once they flip face-up, or a Subterror Behemoth Fiendess that can fill the GY as well as summon a monster from hand, and sometimes gets to add a flip monster from deck or GY to hand! Gallant Granite can be made turn 2 with either two Gurus or Guru and Soma after Soma summons one monster. If we use World Legacy Survivor to search out Soma, we can only make link monsters for the rest of the turn, but if we use Small World or naturally draw Soma we can go into our Utopic Draco Future line. Soma summons two Krawlers from deck, one face-up and one face-down. Soma and the face-up mon XYZs summon for Ghostrick Socuteboss, and overlay for Angel of Mischief. Angel detatches Socuteboss for Ghostrick Shot, or Ghostrick Scare if you drew shot, and you use Shot to summon back Socuteboss who overlays for another Angel of Mischief. The new Angel detatches to search your remaining main-deck Ghostrick card, then you use the two Angels as material for Utopic Future, who then turns into Utopic Draco Future. Ending with UDF, 2 set monsters, and 2 set Spell/Traps (if your first monster was Guru) really turns on your deck's ability to interract on the opponent's turn. As long as we have Guru, and often another monster, face-down with one or more flip enabling Traps, we can extend our plays on the opponent's turn.</p><p>We have Fiendess/a Subterror Behemoth in hand: In their Draw/Standby phase we flip up Guru with Final Battle, searching Fiendess or a Behemoth. We use Fiendess to negate an effect and flip down Guru, which will summon the Behemoth from hand if we contain no face-up cards (if you have Qualiark, you can get it off field with Mind Meld). We can then activate our Junk Sleep/Ghostrick Scare to flip Guru and our other face-down card face-up, activating the other card's effect and setting up Guru to use it's ability to flip itself and another card (usually the opponent's) face-down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World Lines:</p><p>starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; goal&nbsp; (note, you can reverse all of these {goal&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; starter)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any Krawler / Subterror Guru / Nibiru/ Lord of the Heavenly Prison&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Morphing Jar #2&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Subterror Guru / Nibiru / LotHP</p><p>Subterror Behemoth Ultramafus / Umastryx&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Morphing Jar #2&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Subterror Guru / Nibiru / LotHP</p><p>Ultramafus / Morhping Jar #2&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; LotHP</p><p>Any Krawler / Subterror Fiendess / Subterror Behemoths&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Subterror Nemesis Archer&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Fiendess / Behemoths</p><p>Morphing Jar #2&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Guru / Nemesis Archer / Fiendess&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Almost any Krawler (mainly Soma) / Behemoths</p><p>Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Ultramafus&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler (except Axon) / Fiendess / Nemesis Archer / Morphing Jar #2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this list is interesting, and that you found my writeup informative and enjoyable!

This list is inspired by a few users on the Krawler Discord as well as <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/author/yuuka-51582"">Yuuka!'s</a> list. Hopefully you enjoy this list and find the description helpful! If you have any questions, please leave a comment, and if you like the list, please check out my other decks in this series. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In each of this series deck-description, I like to examine what Krawler does well, what it lacks, and what the other archetype(s) bring to the table. Krawlers have a difficult time searching their power cards. Sure, you can use Receptor, but that either takes too long or is a two-for-one trade. They lack protection and negation, apart from Deus X-Krawler, and rely on another card, like World Legacy Pawns, to flip them face-up. Krawlers are a great tool-box archetype. They have in-archetype Spell/Trap and monster removal, have floating effects for when their cards leave the field, and have a card that can send any monster from deck to GY (Dendrite). Krawlers need their partner archetype(s) to shore-up their weaknesses and synergize with their strengths. What do Tindangles do? Tindangles have a lot of flip support. Jhrelth can add from deck or send from deck to GY a Flip mon, Angel can summon a Flip mon from hand or GY, and Hound can flip a card face-down. Tindangles are also all Dark mons, meaning we can play cards like Allure of Darkness or the Shaddoll extra-deck engine. Tindangle on their own lack early access to the extra deck, needing to set up for a turn before flipping their monsters up for link summoning. They also lack serious interraction on the opponent's turn, mostly relying on cards like Nagel's Protection to let them live long enough to amass the resources they need. So, given these two archetypes' strengths and weaknesses, do they syngergize well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally I'd only write one paragraph for this introductory section, but because this list is taking me so long to figure out, I thought it deserved more of an explaination. I believe, and this is just my opinion, that Krawlers and Tindangles do not mix. I know, I know; two of the modern flip archetypes, one (Tindangle) known to be a flip-deck extender, don't mix well? Here's my reasoning: Tindangles have terrible normal summons. Before the addition of Krawler Soma, Krawlers had fairly weak summons/sets, but now that Soma is out, most Krawler plays begin by normal summoning a monster (not setting), and using Soma's effect to set that monster and summon itself. Because of this, Krawlers really want to play with monsters that have really good effects on their normal summon, like Girsu, or flip monsters that have exceptional flip-effects, like Guard Dog. What Tindangle summon helps out the Krawler game plan? Jhrelth special summons itself in face-down defense position, and normal summoning it means giving up the ability to bin a Tindangle from deck, which is a really powerful effect. Angel summons a monster, but Krawlers already have Glial, which does the same thing. Tindangles benefit from the strengths of Krawlers, but I don't think that Krawlers get much out of this partnership. With Soma's ability to board flood and Deus X-Krawlers Skill Drain effect, this deck has more of a board presence to survive the opponent's turn as well as make extra deck plays. Even so, I believe Tindangles are better served by partnering up with Shaddoll or the new Dark World cards. Because of these reasons, I've decided to build this deck not as a blend between Krawler and Tindangle, but a Tindangle list with Krawler support. Okay, enough rambling; thank you for humoring me. Let me know if you have a different opinion; I really want to believe that these archetypes blend well together, I just can't find the reasons why.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This list is really large, and I will absolutely be paring it down, but for now I'll walk through the reasoning on these cards. Nibiru and Lord of the Heavenly Prison are at 2, so that we don't draw multiples. We are playing 7 Tindangle names, which is a lot. I'm trying to highlight Tindangles here, so the goal is to make Acute Cerberus and to flood the field with flip monsters, and we want at least 3 unique names in GY to activate Delaunay. We're on 3 Girsu, as Girsu alone makes Lib the World Key Blademaster with a set Deus X and Pawns, and Girsu with Soma in hand makes the same with El Shaddoll Winda. Amano-Iwato is a great card to flip-up on the opponent's turn, and it is one of our main bridges in the deck, for Small World. Guard Dog is the other main bridge, and an equally powerful card to flip-up on the opponent's turn. Terrifying Toddler of Torment is a fantastic card to dump off of Jhrelth, and its summon from GY can trigger Intruder's ability to summon itself. Toddler can also send Tindangles to GY, which helps us get closer to activating Delaunay. We're on a lot of draw power, because this list really needs it. Allure of Darkness is great, because all Tindangles are Dark, but playing this also means playing multiples of some Tindangles that could probably be at one; I'm not completely sold on this. Pot of Desires is a great budget draw card, but it runs the risk of hitting vital cards in the deck, and should be used as late as possible to avoid doing so. World Legacy Survivors is at 2, as it is a once-per-turn, but it is still one of the best ways to find Soma. The other best way to find them is with Small World, whose bridges I will list at the end of this deck description. The Extra deck is not final, but the main players are fairly fixed. We need Lib and Subterror Behemoth Fiendess. The Shaddoll package is here to stay, as is Acute Cerberus. I'll edit this later with a more finite list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I won't spend too much time on the combos, as other Krawler deck profiles have done the Girsu-Soma line far more competently than I could, but I will provide an idea of what cards we want to open and how to order our plays. As with most modern Krawler lists, we really want to draw/find Soma. If we do, we can usually make Winda, have a set Deus X, or make I:P Masquerena who can link with mons you flip up on the opponent's turn. Most of the Tindangle lines in this deck don't need their normal summon. Jhrelth can special itself, as can Intruder, and Dholes can special another Tindangle. The Tindangles we do normal summon have fairly slow effects, only really benefitting us if we survive the opponent's turn, so using our normal summon on one of these monsters is fine (we can make Winda if we have Soma in hand), but not as optimal as normal summoning Girsu (who can make Winda and Deus X). We want to find Soma and another starter (a normal-summonable monster) as soon as possible on our turn, so Small World is key. To bait out an Ash Blossom we can start with an Allure or a World Legacy Survivor, as these plays don't often lock us out of using Small World. Pot of Desires can sometimes lock us out of Small World (if we banish our bridges), so try to use your other resources before fishing with Desires. What do we send off of Jhrelth? If we are planning to flood the board with face-downs, we want Intruder in the GY. Delaunay in the GY is great for turn two, but it doesn't help us survive our opponent's next turn. Dholes is a really good send off of Jhrelth so long as we have another Tindangle in the GY, usually from Survivor. We can use this same line of thought when sending a card off of Dendrite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'll try to come back and add more thoughts on combo lines and board setup once this list is more finalized.For now, here are the bridges:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World Bridges:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Nibiru / Lord of the Heavenly Prison -&gt;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Nibiru / Lord of the Heavenly Prison</p><p>Girsu / Any Krawler / Guard Dog&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu / Any Krawler / Guard Dog&nbsp;</p><p>Any Krawler / Jhrelth / Toddler&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Guard Dog&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Jhrelth / Toddler</p><p>Level 4 Tindangle&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato&nbsp; -&gt; Nibiru / LotHP / Girsu / Any Krawler / Guard Dog</p><p>Any non-level 4 Tindangle&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; LotHP</p><p>Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Dendrite&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato / Guard Dog</p><p>Dendrite&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Amano-Iwato / LotHP</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this list! If you found it interesting, or you have some suggestions, please leave a comment and let me know what you think! I believe that taking a less-than-meta deck and trying to optimize it is a great exercize in creative thinking and deckbuilding, and I would highly suggest it to anyone who is interested! The Side Deck is mostly a collection of unfinished ideas and tech-pieces that I couldn't find a home for in this list, but maybe you can? Thank you for reading and have a good day!</p>"

Tearalement engine crazy as is already, de fleur a necessity (access it through ash and a level 7 i.e. Nessie or Dogman), the Tearalements boss monster is level 9 and easy to bring out so calamities is also an option via 2 of the boss monster. You can toss in absolute and vortex for that play as well.</p><p>Idk if there's a community tab to converse about the deck but I'd appreciate feed back otherwise go nuts.</p>"

The main goal of this deck is summon out the big bad 'Red Supernova Dragon' to the field, who is one of the closest monsters you can get to a ""play it and win"" card. One this thing is on the field, it becomes a super opressive beatstick that is absurdly hard to out due to it recycling itself with its own effect while simultaneously nuking the board. However, effects that will send this card to the graveyard or banish it will remove it from the game, as such the secondary objective is to keep 'Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss' on the field to negate such effects. Remeber, HRDAA's effect is a once per turn quick effect, so do not be afraid to negate crucial cards in opponents combos on their turn to further keeping Red Supernova safe which can be easily summoned out with Assistance of 'Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon' and 'Synchron Resonator'. Overall, a good turn with this deck should look like 'Red Supernova Dragon' and 'HRDAA' being out on the field, with materials in the graveyard to special summon Chaos Ruler in the event Red Supernova and HRDAA are outed.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, this deck is extremely combo heavy, and as such hand traps and cards like Baronne are an issue, the negation of Red Rising Dragon's effect can stop your entire plan, as such cards like Droplet and Dark Ruler will help minimize such negates from happening as often. It should go without saying, but try to special summon as often as you can with this deck. If you waste your Normal Summon too early, negates on valuable cards can very well shut you out for the rest of your turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to effects from cards such as 'Red Dragon Archfiend Bane', 'Synchron Resonator' and 'Wandering King Wildwind' this deck also has good recycle capabilities, with most resonators in your graveyard ending up back in your hand, or deck at some point later in the match. This makes resonator command super valueabe to hold for situations where you find yourself without level 4 monsters to synchro with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth mentioning however, that this deck is somewhat prone to bricking. While I stress, it is EXTREMELY uncommon, and this varient of the deck I beleive to be the most consistent possible, there will be ocassions where you will not be able to act at all due to the hand being cluttered by resonators and no level 4 monsters, or vice versa. So if you plan to use this deck more competitivley, please keep this in mind. If you do have a resource issue, summonign Beelze can be a very solid stall tactic as he is a cheap, generic beatstick that is difficult to out. So do keep this in mind as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also worthing noting, that you should not be afraid to activate 'Skull Miesters' effect if a card of value is activating their effect from the graveyard, even if he is your only level 4 monster in your hand. Trust me, sometimes it is far more valueable to give him up, then let your opponent combo, as there is a solid chance you draw another card to replace him your following turn. This has won me games.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this deck is super soild and I adore it. The playstyle feels very rewarding and empowering when your board is set up properly and Red Dragon Archfiend has always been a favourite of mine, so I may be a little bias. Hope everyone who tries this one out enjoys, and feel free to give me feedback!</p>"

That way, you can use your Reich Heart search on one of the powerful traps (particularly Twin Saw) instead of the Nova. This gives you an additional pop 2 on your opponents turn and a way to lock out link based decks.</li><li><strong>Abuse Reicht Hearts Draw Effect:</strong> Always try to summon Reicht Heart with 2 other defence position monsters on the field to get its extra draw effect. It's a lot easier than you think and lets you snowball very early in the game.</li><li><strong>Rescue Cat High Risk High Reward:</strong> Rescue cat lets you just generate more advantage and use your field spell search on visas starfrost so you can go into the Baronne combo. A rescue cat line uses your normal summon without getting a Scareclaw name onto the field and is vulnerable to handtraps, so if you want to play the version that can play through multiple interruptions and isn't as high-rolley, swap the rescue cats for Dark Rulers or other hand traps.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use Trich Heart at the end of the combo:&nbsp;</strong>He locks you out of summoning non-scareclaw monsters so use him last. Best practice is to summon Acroa is possible for the attack gain (but any is fine), then search Reicht Heart for the follow up. Instant +2 in addition to the lock and sets up tribute fodder for Twin Saw.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><strong>Barrone</strong><span>: If you have Visas starfrost, you can pop your Licht Heart to summon it, then summon back the Licht Heart bu its own effect. This is an easy way to get 3 monsters on the field for Trich Heart, but is also your best way to get Baronne on board turn 1. The Baronne combo is similar to the above combo, but you just need to save enough extenders to make both the Licht Heart and save the Reich Heart and Visas Starfrost to make the Baronne. This is the most feasible when you open rescue cat, but can be done without it if you draw any 3 scareclaw monsters including at least one of Visas Starfrost or Reicht Heart (plus you get the Reicht Heart draw effect).</span></strong></li><li><strong>Bagooska:</strong> Parallel Exceed is a free way to get Bagooska out which can either layer with the Trich Heart to double the lock or climb into Zeus.&nbsp;</li></ul>"

Use Tear to create a strong board that supports Tindangle plays!,"<p>This deck is a funny idea that hasn't quite landed on a viable build yet. Tindangles love to be in the GY, but are slow to send themselves to the GY. Tearlaments can fill up the GY very quickly, so they seem like a nice match (please ignore the Tears missing timing off of Jhrelth)! This isn't a list where I'm trying to make a strong Tearlament buiild, but rather an attempt at making Tindanlges pop off in a deck that supports them!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The basic gameplan is turn one: do all of your Tear combos and setup while filling the GY with Tindangles, getting a few summons off of Dholes. Turn Two: flip up your set tindangles and prep the board for you to link into Cerb or make more fusion mons. I don't really know what I want the deck to do beyond this, but I'm posting this thought experiment here in case somebody with more Tindangle or Tearlament know-how can help me to improve upon these foundations. Thanks, and have a good day!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Thanks to the effect of Dark Spirit's Mastery, you can search any level 8 fiend-type monster including your unchained cards, the necrofears, and, hilariously, lava golem. The ideal setup requires you to use tour guide and ochthros in order to setup your hand and graveyard. Ideally, you want to search whatever is missing in your hand. You want any of the dark spirit cards in your hand to help get necrofear or the level 8 unchained cards out of the grave while being able to dump or add any of them at your leisure with any mix of scarm, octhros, fiendish rhino warrior, or cherubini. All in all, this deck is incredibly fun and surprisingly viable against many competetive decks.&nbsp;</p>"

It is also used for the crack-back. Toadally with elf gives you a frog and 2 omni negates. This deck is for primarily going first but, when you go second, or on the crack-back, Zeus, Dark Ruler, Triple Tactics, Lava Golem, Duster they are all good board breakers. The combos are able to play around a hand trap or even two. Overall this deck is really strong and meta defining.</p>"

From events that happened in the past 2 years I started playing again, to up until now where I am trying to fix myself for the betterment of others around me. Needless to say, it has gotten to the point where I have been exhausted mentally as of late. However what I have forgotten was a not a deck, but an archetype that doesn't require much afterthought nor compensation to run. Plus with the meta shifting for the 5th (6th) time this summer, I think it is clear that ""War Rocks"" are the archetype that is a little lax with your brain more than anything (or at least for me).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; While ""War Rocks"" have been the butt-end joke of the Yu-Gi-Oh community for being the ""knife you take to a gunfight""; the whole intention of their existence is to be a relic of a long gone era where it's about beating the ever loving shite out of your opponent until they bleed themselves out of consciousness. From War Rock Fortia being able to search an archetype card (such as their field spell, War Rock Mountain); to War Rock Wento having the ability to drain 800ATK on quick effect from your opponents battling monster (if they're going at it against a ""War Rock"" monster of course), they can at least do something other than ""beat the shit out of you until you bleed out of consciousness"". Now while the Extra Deck is an optional tool (hence why Pot of Extravagance is in the deck), cards like Ultimate Slayer are at their peak with ""War Rocks"" due to my deck having cards like Elder Entity N'tss and PSY-Framelord Omega as hit pieces. However the most common package I have been playing with ""War Rocks"" is the Utopia Package; and simply because with War Rock Fortia and War Rock Gactos, you can easily go into Number 39: Utopia in one turn with no remorse. If you did this however, you can also go into Number S39: Utopia the Lightning (a very ""beat the shit out of you until you bleed out of consciousness"" XYZ monster); Number 39: Utopia beyond, but with the spell card Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (basically yeets everyone of your opponents monster's attack to 0); or Number 99: Utopic Dragon (AKA: Number F0: Utopic Draco Future before he was cool af) by discarding the already mentioned Rank-Up spell card from your hand.</p>"

Unlike my first list, this build uses a strong suite of hand traps to stop the opponent's plays if they go first or to solidify our interruption tools if we go first. Nibiru can be swapped out for the Spright matchup, but it definitely has utility vs some of the other prominent meta threats. We're only on one copy of Calamity Upon the Hidden City, as it is a bit too bricky. I still think this card has utility, letting us boost Guru to a 3100 attacker, but Lord of the Heavenly Prison is much better protection for our face-down cards. This list trims down the Krawler package to just the bare minimum; we use this package primarily for making UDF. The one Morphing Jar #2 is our primary Small World bridge. I'm not finished testing with this list, and will most likely be making changes, but please let me know what you think! Any input you have is helpful!</p>"

I'm creating/uploading it as part of a series where I examine as many Krawler builds as I can and try to create some interesting/unusual decks with them. This particular build uses the new Vernusylph cards, an archetype which sends to the GY and then special-summons Earth monsters sent by the previous effect, in addition to another effect (card search, send from deck to GY, draw 1 card). Their boss monster, Vera, the Vernusylph Goddess, can steal an opponent's mon on your turn and revive an Earth monster on the opponent's turn, as well as provide a monster-negate if you control 5 or more Earth monsters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vernusylph doesn't mesh particularly well with Krawlers. Krawlers like to be flipped from a face-down position, and Vernusylph summons them face-up on the field. Subterror, on the other hand, have no problem being summoned face-up, and sometimes even prefer it (in the case of Subterror Fiendess or Guru). Also, since Vernusylph lock you into Earth effects for the rest of the turn, it is difficult to go into the UDF line with Krawler Soma (usually requiring Ghostrick Angel of Mischief's activated effect). So, what does this deck do? Mostly, I think it proves that Krawler does not benefit from Vernusylph support, and is even hurt by it, while also showing how Subterror benefits from the same partnership. I will be creating a Subterror-Vernusylph list later to highlight this deck theory, but for now I'll explain the choices in the main and extra decks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Main deck, we want to include as many big bunguses as possible. Vernusylph can cheat out all of the Subterror Behemoths, as well as Deus X-Krawler, though the later is much less effective as it needs to be flipped up to activate its effect. I cut Guru and Fiendess to 2-a-piece, as we have other ways of searching/summoning our Subterror mons. We're running a minimal Krawler package, because we are often summoning cards face-up, but we still benefit from Soma. If we send and revive Soma using a Vern card, we can activate its effect to summon 2 other face-up cards. Then, if we normal-summon a monster face-up, we can link off our board into Saryuja Skull Dread, Apollousa, or Avramax (after making 2 link-2s). We're on 3 Sol and Luna and 3 World Legacy Pawns, mostly there for the benefit of the Krawlers in the list. The Hidden City is at 3 here, as we can search the Behemoths to dump and revive with Vern cards. We're running most of the Vernusylphs in this list. Flourishing Hills and Flowering Fields are exeptional at protecting our face-up monsters, and Vera is a fantastic boss monster. In the extra deck, we have Gallant Granite and Bagooska, which can both be made with Vernusylph/Guru/Soma. Most of the other cards are Earth, so we can still make plays under the Vernusylph lock. Curious is a good turn 2 play if we have a board already set up. The extra deck is not where I want it to be, though, and I'm still experimenting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thats most of the thought process behind this list; as I said previously, I'm not very happy with the list, but perhaps someone will find something of value here or take away inspiration for their own build. Thank you for your time, and I hope you have a great day!</p>"

I like the idea of decking your opponent out like its a health bar and since the entire archetype is just a bunch of spells, why not throw sky srtiker into the mix? since your only going to ever control 1 monster at most, you can get their effects fairly easily, on top of the bonus effects since you'll be throwing out spells like crazy. this deck is fairly good at controlling the tempo of the game and you can do it better if you throw a few floodgates in. Going second will also be a good pick if you throw in a couple of board breakers. Overall i feel this deck shows some promises as a possible striker engine</p>"

Vernusylphs give us the ability to send from the hand, or deck, Subterror Behemoths to the GY, and then reborn an Earth monster! Vernusylphs lock us into only using Earth monster effects for the rest of the turn, which isn't a problem since all of the Subterror monsters are Earth-type. Since we're playing a flip-deck, we need Spell/Traps that flip our mons and other cards to protect those Spell/Traps. The Extra Deck is not finalized, but it is a rough assembly of cards that benefit our strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is based off of suggestions and information from the Subterror Discord, most notably from user ThePurplePancake. Many thanks to you, this list would not be nearly as competent without your help!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are playing 3 Lord of the Heavenly Prison, our main way to protect our backrow and set cards. What we grab off of the summon of LotHP depends, but will usually be The Hidden City (if we haven't found it already), Sol and Luna (for removal), or Pot of Desires for draw power. We are playing 1 Nibiru, searchable off of Gallant Granite. 1 apiece of Subterror Behemoths Voltelluric, Umastryx, and Stygokraken. If we end on a board without Guru or fiendess, we want Umastryx. Otherwise, it depends on our opponent's deck which Behemoth we want to search. We are on 1 Guru and 3 Fiendess. Normally Fiendess is best at 2 or 1, but in this list we can normal summon Fiendess and use their effect to reborn a Behemoth. FOr hand traps, we are playing 2 Ash Blossom, 2 Ghost Ogre, 2 D.D. Crow, and 2 Infinite Impermanence. We are on 3 Sol and Luna and 3 Final Battle for our flip Spell/Traps. The Vernusylphs are 3 Awakening Forests (our main way of searching Behemoths), 3 Fourishing Hills (can search any other Vernusylph card), 2 Thawing Mountains (draws us a card), 1 Vera, the Vernusylph Goddess, 1 Corolla (makes our Subterror mons Vernusylphs, benefitting from Flourishing Hill's protection), and 1 Flower Buds (decent removal spell, resets the board). I'm currently on 1 Planet Pathfinder, as finding The Hidden City is vital to most of our plays, but I may cut this, and other cards, as I play-test more with this list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The primary combo with this deck is started by opening The Hidden City and any Vernusylph. One of the optimal lines is Hidden CIty + Awakening Forests. Play the Hidden City, search and set Guru, use Hidden City to flip Guru and search Fiendess. Activate Awakening Forests to discard itself and Fiendess and send a Behemoth of your choice from the extra-deck to the GY. If you have a Sol+Luna or a Final Battle in hand, use Fiendess to flip-down Guru and revive the Behemoth, and set your Spell/Traps. If you have another Vernusylph and a mosnter in hand, use the Vern to reborn the Behemoth, instead, leaving Guru, Fiendess, and the Behemoth face-up. Opening Fiendess and Awakening Forests/Flourishing Hills is also a strong start. Discard Fiendess for the Vernusylph activation, and send a Behemoth to the GY while reviving Fiendess. If you used Flourishing Hills, search Awakening forests, and use their effect to send the Behemoth. Any Play where you can start with Awakening Forests, you can instead start with Flourishing Hills, as long as you have enough monsters in hand to activate their effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this has been an interesting take on Subterrors with the new Vernusylph as support! If you have any questions or ideas for the deck, please leave a comment down below!</p>"

Same with the third sigma. Mathmech Equation SHOULD be an induction since its a searchable Mine out, but guess what I dont have an induction, and an extender that also turns whatever it reborns into a better beater isnt necessarily BAD, but if you have an induction definitely run that instead.&nbsp;</p><p>The ""spice"" in this take on mathmech is in the side, being able to side in 5 more hand traps and siding in pitknight + heatsoul is a viable option you can side into. Now if you draw into imperm while you have heatsoul, uuuuuh it sucks, which is why more realistically you will side out probably the DRNM for nib, and 2 of the imperms for veiler, bringin your hand trap count up to 12 which is a little low for heatsoul but workable.</p><p>This obviously isn't the approach you want to take vs spright, since gigantic makes nib a brick, but with more people opting to run board breakers instead of hand traps some, rogue decks that make insane endboards (think maybe raidraptor kali yuga turbo), but die to nib or a well placed veiler might start stealing more games at the local or regional level, so at the very least I think nib is worth siding this format. Maybe not heatsoul, we'll see.</p><p>A more standard sideboard would probably run Dimensional Barrier at 3 in addition to rivalry, you call XYZ vs spright and you call fusion vs tear. Still hits a good amount of the format. Ironically I think nib is pretty good for the mathmech mirror, assuming that you can bait out the diameter negate with something like an ash or imperm before going for the nib. No idea what is good vs Rikka. Obviously rivalry does nothing, and since they run the sunavalon link package D barrier is sub optimal as well. Unsure if they play into nib. Anti-spell is probably the move vs rikka, keep them off the field spell at all costs, but that only works going first. If going second, it may be prudent to treat the rikka field spell like mine, and side in the cosmics.</p><p>TL;DR: The current side deck is experimental, siding into heatsoul + more hand traps to draw with heatsoul, designed to try and crush random rogue decks that normally aren't prepared for. A more standard side deck would remove the veilers, the heatsoul, the pitknight, and final sigma (5 cards), for 2 anti-spell fragrance, and 3 Dimensional Barrier. Nib is worth siding either way. Also the main deck ratios are kind of fucked, but that's just because those are the cards I have.</p>"

Now, although conventional wisdom says that you should play the minimum number of cards possible to increase consistency, this Deck isn't hampered by reaching the 60 card limit. With essentially all the Zombies having either a discard, GY, and/or banishing effect that lets you summon another Zombie from hand, Deck, or GY, there's essentially no way you'll have a dead hand. That said, if your opponent locks down the GY (say, with Abyss Dweller or Necrovalley), you're going to be in for a rough time.</p>"

Block Dragon and Meow-Meow Mu), Adamancipators are still able to create some powerful end boards that can make things difficult for your opponent to deal with. Uninterupted, you can easily land on a board with multiple negates (a Spell/Trap negate from Adamancipator Risen-Dragite, monster negates with either Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon or Apollousa, and an omni-negate with Borreload Savage Dragon). Or, if you're feeling really cheeky, you can set up both Shenshen and Chengying and reap the banishing benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you might be noticing a few peculiar inclusions in this build, but there is a method to the madness. One-Time Passcode can give you a Level 4 for either synchro or link plays on the rare occassions that your Adamancipator tuners fail to give you a Level 4 or lower non-tuner with their excavation effects...not that the extra monster isn't also useful when you do hit a good excavation of course. Guardian Sphinx and Power Giant are both in here as Shooting Riser Dragon targets, depending on what monster you aim to make with it...that said, both monsters have their uses outside of this as Power Giant can special summon itself by pitching a monster from hand, which is particularly nice if you have Jet Synchron in hand too, and Guardian Sphinx, if it's summoned by the effect of Rapite, can flip itself face-down and pose a serious problem for your opponent if they don't manage to deal with it by your next turn. Both Plaguespreader and Jet Synchron are here as Halqifibrax targets, as both of them can activate their recursion effects in the GY after they've been used for synchro/link plays, and Parallel eXceed is here as the prime target for making Gallant Granite.</p>"

We want to slow down the game to a pace we can control and use our board-breakers and stun tools to keep the opponent from being able to meaningfully interract with our board. This is a part of a series I'm working on where I try to build as many variants of Krawler as I can. I'm doing so to stretch myself creatively, and to get to know the archetype better. I'll be going over what Krawlers do well/poorly, what the blending of these archetypes brings to the deck, as well as a card-by-card of the most notable additions to this list. This list was made possible by contributions from the Krawler discord, and user Marowak2000 in particular, so many thank!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, Krawlers: what do they do well, what do they struggle with, and what does their partner in this build (Kaiju) bring to the table? Krawlers have a very strong grind game. Each Krawler you get to stick on field is a renewable effect to either pop a card, summon a Krawler from GY or hand, or to return 2 cards from GY to hand (just the Krawlers in this list). They can flood the board, thanks to Soma, and have a strong Skill Drain monster in Deus X-Krawler, not to mention all of the Krawlers (except Soma) float into more Krawlers! The downside is that these are still flip-monsters, and as such they needs lots of support to get the best out of them. A going-first build has to contend with the opponent's hand traps and interruption as well as board clears like Lightning Storm, Raigeki, and Harpie's Feather Duster. Kaijus help the Krawlers generally slow, setup-oriented gameplan by allowing us to go second. We let the opponent make their best board, and then we Dark Ruler, Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, and just plain old Kaiju the opponent's best sources of interruption before making our board. By going second, we avoid the most damaging removal for Krawlers (when they're face-down and can't float), and get many of the opponent's most powerful mosnters out of the way. One of the main risks of this approach is if the opponent is playing a Trap/Quickplay deck like Labrynth or Runic, in which case we will need to side into other board-breaking options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our Kaiju package is 2 Gadarla, 2 Gameciel, 3 Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, 1 Kyoutou Waterfront (for the grind game), and 1 Thunder King (searchable off of Deus X-Krawler's floating effect).We're on Beetrooper Scale Bomber and Magical Hound as our Small World bridges, but they both do work for the deck; Scale Bomber is an extender and Magical Hound can bounce a floodgate. We are on 1 World Armor for a Girsu line ending on Equimax, using our 1 World Legacy Succession. We are on 1 Knightmare Corruptor Iblee to further control our opponent's board, but she may not be necessary. We are on 2 World Legacy Mind Meld, usually to send off of Girsu to guarantee Deus X-Krawler, and we play 2 copies to lower the chance of drawing both. The three flip Spell/Traps in this list are played at 2 each: Sol and Luna(EDIT: now at 3), Junk Sleep, and World Legacy Pawns. I'm considering lpaying Sol and Luna at 3; it is a hard once-per-turn, but it is invaluable in breaking boards and activating Krawler flip-effects (I've since updated the list with Sol and Luna at 3). Junk Sleep has niche uses when we want to activate more than one Krawler at once, and it flips all of our monsters face-down at the end of each turn, which is a great way to re-use Soma's effect. World Legacy Pawns only targets one monster, but it is searchable off of Lib and Survivor, and it can be activated more freely than Junk Sleep's reactive activation. In the extra deck we have the usual suspects like I:P Masquerena, Avramax and the Knightmares. Since we are going second, Dharc can often steal a card out of the opponent's GY. We can make Wina off of two flip-monsters and Girsu, using Shaddoll Construct to perform the fusion. Gigantic Spright lets us set up the Iblee line and link off into Dharc, I:P Masquerena, or another Link 2. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our main line of play is, as said above, going second. If we open Dark Ruler, IKS, or Kaiju(s) we can pressure the opponent's field and remove their most critical monsters. Once we have done so, we need to mop up the rest of their board. We have a few options for this, most of which start with Girsu. Normal Girsu, pitch Mind Meld, make the Girsu token, use Soma to flip Girsu face-down and summon Soma. Activate Soma to summon 2 more face-up Krawlers from deck, link Soma and the token for Lib, activate Lib to set Pawns, link the small Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct and make Winda with the Construct and the face-down Girsu. This line is only beneficial if you cleared most of the opponent's board before going for it. If the opponent still has a lot of threats still in play, start instead by normal summoning Girsu and sending World Armor to the GY. Make Lib (Soma/Girsu token) and search Succession. Activate Succession summoning back World Armor, and searching Survivor/Pawns/Mind Meld (depending on what you need). Link off for either Avramax or Equimax and attack the rest of the opponent's board. If we start with Soma and another normal-summonable monster instead, we summon the monster, activate and summon Soma, and use Soma to summon 2 more Krawlers from deck. Link off for I:P Masquerena, then Equimax, attacking into the Kaiju you positioned so that Equimax would be pointing to it. Other plays we can make to clear boards include setting Spine and using Sol and Luna to flip Spine up and an opponent's monster face-down, then using Spine to pop an opponent's monster. To use Iblee, we need Soma and any normal-summonable monster in hand. Normal summon, then special Soma by flipping that monster face-down, use Soma to summon 2 Krawlers, either 1 face-up or both face-up. Overlay for Gigantic, use Gigantic to summon Iblee, then link Iblee and another monster off for any Link 2 monster, summoning Iblee to the opponent's field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Small World bridgs are as follows:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Gameciel / Any Krawler / Scale Bomber&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Gadarla&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Gameciel / Any Krawler / Scale Bomber</p><p>Gadarla / Any Krawler&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Scale Bomber&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Gadarla</p><p>World Armor / Any Krawler / Girsu&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Magical Hound&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; World Armor / Any Krawler / Girsu</p><p>Soma / Magical Hound&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; World Armor&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma / Magical Hound</p><p>Thunder King / Iblee / Magical Hound / Scale Bomber&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Krawler Spine&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Thunder King / Iblee / Magical Hound / Scale Bomber</p><p>Deus X-Krawler / Spine &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Thunder King&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Deus X-Krawler / Spine</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Side Deck is just a collection of possible includes and ideas for alternative takes on this build.</p><p>Thanks so much for reading my decklist and explaination!

The deck can make some crazy combos and is quite consistent for a rogue deck. The deck can also set uo nice plays for your 2nd turn by having Cynet Ritual in grave as well as Accesscode Talker, Cyberse Clock Dragon and even Avida, Rebuilder of Worlds ready to go. Avida is funny and in theory seemed good but usually either Darkfluid just wins the game on its own or opponent gets rid of it and OTKs. So, if you want less gimmicks you might want to replace it with just some special summonable cyberse or something. This is a rogue combo deck so going second in these times in yugioh is very challenging as there are so many things that can just stop the combo, which is one of the major reasons why you don't really see me going second replays in the video. The other reason being that I got tired of hunting for better replays because Edo players kept quitting mid combo in 3 out of 4 games. The one-off cyberse monsters in the side are just combo extenders meant to replace Dark Ruler No Mores when you know you are going second. </span></p>"

With four engines, Endymion, Mythical beast, Spellbook and Invoked, the deck has potential for an incredibly powerful turn one setup, but it's main weakness lies with needing all of the cards in it's hand to play (the only one card starter is MM or aleister). This means it's incredibly vulnerable to handtraps/interruption, and that drawing too many handtraps ruins hands. The staples that work best with the deck are the spells, like DRNM and Forbidden Droplets, as they add to your spellcount amount. The deck has many linear combos, and while the sequencing may change, or you draw the spellbook engine instead of the invoked engine, you'll find yourself performing the same combos nontheless.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>"

Uses the Krawler engine to make Gigantic Spright or UDF.,"<p>This is another deck in a series of lists I've been creating where I see how many Krawler build I can put together. I'm going for creativity, originality, and hopefully viability. This list blends Krawlers with Ghostricks, an archetype either known for its wild Extra Deck combo enablers or its slow Main Deck control options. I'm blending a little of both in a build that balances control and combo, board-breaking and board-protecting.&nbsp; If you enjoy this list, please check out some of the other Krawler builds that I've created! I'll be breaking down the deck concept, the card choices, and a few combo lines down below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Krawlers, as an archetype, lend themselves to control strategies, as do most flip-effect decks. The easiest way of flipping up a card is simply waiting for your opponent to attack into it, or to wait until your next turn to flip it up. With the introduction of Krawler Soma, Krawlers also have combo plays. They can get 3 monsters face-up on the board very easily, but don't have the strongest Extra Deck tools to take advantage of this. Ghostricks are similar to Krawlers, though they are not technically flip monsters. Their Main Deck cards are mostly focused around controlling the opponent's plays while accruing card advantage, but their Extra Deck is all about the combo! Any level 1, 2, or 3 Ghostrick Xyz mon can make Angel of Mischief, who can detatch to search a Ghostrick Spell/Trap, and the level 1 and 3 Xyz mons return cards from GY to hand when they are sent there. This makes UDF very accessible, and if you have a Ghostrick field spell, Zeus is also on the table (as you can attack directly). So, Krawlers flood the board with monsters that we can Xyz climb with, and the Ghostrick ED lets us take advantage of the monsters on field. There is a small problem; Soma needs a face-up monster to summon itself, and all of the main deck Ghostricks cannot be summoned face-up unless their is already another face-up Ghostrick monster. We solve this problem with Parallel Exceed and Tour Guide, but there are more capable builds. I will also be building a Spright build that really ramps up this deck's speed and ability to play through interruption, but for now I'm focusing on pure Ghostrick Krawler.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our main combo starter is Parallel Exceed, run at 3. If we open this card and any Ghostrick, we can make Angel of Mischief and search a card. If we also open Soma (run at 3), its full combo to UDF and Necrovalley. If, instead, we open Parallel Exceed and Tour Guide (run at 2), that also gets us UDF, and often Necrovalley (depending on the other cards in hand). We run just one copy of Krawler Glial, one of Axon,and one Spine, the summons off of Soma. This is a very tight list, and though I would love to run more Krawlers, I simply don't have the room (which is why Tour Guide is at 2). For the Ghostricks, we run 1 Jiangshi (searches Mary/Lantern), 1 Fairy (returns Ghostrick cards from GY to field), 1 Nekomusume (one of our main floodgates), 1 Doll (flips the whole board face-down in the end phase), and 1 Lantern with 1 Mary (our combat tricks). This list could be trimmed by removing Jiangshi, Lantern, and Mary, but I prefer to leave them in for now. To protect our board, we're on 3 Lord of the Heavenly Prison and 3 Calamity Upon the Hidden City, which also buffs our mons. We run 2 Shot and 2 Scare, they are easily searchable, but we want multiples for future turns. Ghostrick Renovation gets us to Necrovalley, and Ghostrick Night keeps the opponent's mons face-down. Kurikara Divincarnate is our primary board breaker, used either going second or on our second turn, it lets us respond to the opponent's monster effects by tributing them for cost and summoning a big beater. Finally, our Small World bridges (there are a lot). Lady of the Labrynth can get us into Parallel Exceed, and she is also a great draw, letting us search one-ofs like Lost Wind or Compulsory Evacuation Device. Mothman is a bridge to and from the Krawlers, and can work as a risky card draw option. Since Parallel Exceed is so important in this list, we have another way of bridging into them with Micro Coder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the extra deck, we're on all of the Ghostricks, the UDF line, Gigantic Spright (who can summon Nekomusume), Dharc to steal an opponent's mon, Almiraj (if we have Parallel and a Small Krawler in hand), and Knightmare Unicorn. We are running Sky Calvalry Centaurea to make Zeus off of the Soma summons, usually when we have to go second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck has quite a few interesting lines!</p><p>Our basic combos are as follows:</p><p>Parallel and a Ghostrick: Set the Ghostrick, and link into Festival. Activate Parallel, summoning Parallel from hand, then Parallel from deck. Make Angel with the two, then detatch to search. If we have the field spell or Renovations in hand, search the one you don't have and activate the field spell with a set Renovations, we can then go into Necrovalley on the opponent's turn. If you don't have either of those, grap Shot to summon back the Ghostrick in GY and flip them down, or Scare if you have a Shot already in hand.</p><p>Parallel and a Krawler/MicroCoder: Summon the Krawler, then link them off for Almiraj. Follow the steps in the combo above, starting when you first summon Parallel Exceed.</p><p>Tour Guide: Summon Tour Guide, special summoning Tour Guide from deck. Overlay for Alucard, overlay him for Angel. Detatch one of the Guides to search Shot, then link Angel off for Festival. Trigger Alucard in Gy (not a once-per-turn) to add Angel back to the ED, then Shot back the Alucard. Overlay again for Angel, then detatch the Alucard to search Scare/Mansion/Renovations (use the combo above to determine what to search). When Alucard hits the GY, add back Shot for next turn (sadly, this is a once-per-turn).</p><p>Soma and Scale Bomber / Mothman / Krawler / Micro Coder: Normal the starter (level &lt;=4 mon) and flip them down to summon Soma. Use Soma, summoning two Krawlers from deck, one face-up the other face-down. Overlay your two face-up monsters into Socuteboss, overlaying her for Angel. Detatch Socuteboss to search Shot, Shot back Socuteboss and make another Angel. Detatch Socuteboss again to search Scare, then overlay the two Angels for Utopic Future. Overlay for Utopic Draco Future, set your Scare and you're all set!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More involved combos:</p><p>Parallel, a Ghostrick, and Soma: Follow the same steps for the combo above with Parallel and a Ghostrick, searching Renovations or Mansion. Your board should now be Ghostrick Festival and Ghostrick Angel of Mischief. Summon Soma by flipping down the Angel, activate Soma to summon 2 Krawlers, one face-up the other face-down. Make UDF using the steps above, but search Renovations or Mansion instead of Scare (unless you have both in hand). Activate the field spell and set Renovations, and you have a board with Necrovalley on the opponent's turn, UDF, and Festival.</p><p>Parallel, a Ghostrick, and Soma: For this combo, our goal is not UDF, but rather Nekomusume. Follow the Parallel and Ghostrick combo, ending on Festival and Angel, but search Ghostrick Scare instead of Renovations or Mansion. Summon the Soma by flipping down Angel, then summon one Krawler face-up, the other face-down. Overlay the two face-up monsters into Gigantic Spright, then detatch to summon Nekomusume from deck. You then have Festival, Gigantic, Nekomusume, a face-down Krawler and a face-down Angel, and Scare set.</p><p>Parallel and Tour Guide: Perform the Tour Guide combo from the Tour Guide section above, but only to the point where you have searched Shot and linked off Angel for Festival. Activate the Parallel in hand and the Alucard in GY, summoning the Parallel and adding back the Angel with Alucard. Summon the second Parallel using the firsts effect. Overlay for Angel, searching Mansion afterwards. Shot back Alucard and overlay for Angel. Detatch Alucard from Angel to search Renovations, adding back the Shot from GY when Alucard is sent there. Overlay the 2 Angels for Utopic Future, then into Utopic Draco Future. You will end with Festival, UDF, and Necrovalley live.</p><p>Tour Guide and Soma: Perfom the Tour Guide combo from the Tour Guide Section above, ending on just the first Angel on field after having searched Shot. Flip down Angel to summon Soma, use Soma to Summon 2 Krawlers, one face-down, the other face-up. From here you can either fallow the first Parallel/Ghostrick/Soma combo to end on UDF or the second to end on Nekomusume.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alright, I'm basically done, now just to describe the many Small World bridges!</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Any Dark Monster (except Lantern) / Divincarnate / Spine / Parallel Exceed&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Micro Codeer&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Dark but Lantern / Divincarnate / Spine / Parallel</p><p>Any Krawler / Any Dark&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mothman&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Any Dark</p><p>Any Dark (not LotHP / Mary / Lantern) / Parallel&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Lady of the Labrynth&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Dark (not LotHP / Mary / Lantern) / Parallel</p><p>&nbsp;Soma / Micro Coder / Lady&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Parallel Exceed -&gt;&nbsp; Soma / Micro Coder / Lady</p><p>Parallel / Mothman&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Parallel / Mothman</p><p>Any Dark (not Lady)&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; LotHP&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Dark (not Lady)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whew!

It good because the suship part of the deck is a really good draw engine and combining it with different cards like number f0, zeus and leo can make the deck very powerfull because leo leaves you with two monster negates and f0 and zeus are just generaly good cards. Some other cards in there like lightning, abyss dweller, daigusto and others are just there as they are doing decent in this current format and I was supprised with how well this deck plays in the current meta. Hope you enjoy the deck I made and that it does as well for you as it does for me.</p>"

Cup of Ace is there too if you're lucky enough.</p><p>In this game Brionac is Pre-errata, and for some reason Dark End Dragon doesn't target.</p><p>If you prefer it to be 40 card and oriented towards a first turn win, move Malicious to the side, this way it's more consistent on setting up the draw engines but considerably weaker when you either brick or can't recover all pieces of Exodia.</p><p>When it comes to dueling, you can summon 2 Shooting Star Dragon with a 5 card combo (if you draw Monster reborn with the draws you get along the way + after), or De-Synchro Mistwurm to clear a field, equip Armory Arm to a Synchro, use De-Synchro on your opponent, etc.</p><p>Malicious doubles as discard fooder/Foolish target and a LV7/8 Synchro material (with it you can summon two Shooting Star Dragon with a 5 card combo). It's also good as not to run out of Foolish Burial targets.</p><p>Remember not to de-synchro your monsters if the materials are no longer in the GY (careful with Plaguespreader Zombie)</p><p>If you brick and discard the head of Exodia, make sure to save Monster reborn to summon it and bring it back to hand with Zephyros (who can also be used for synchro summoning, to get more discard fooder and for an extra spell activation. Remember that in Tag Duels both you and your partner can use it's effect. If you prefer Monster Reincarnation replace it).</p><p>If you can't recover all pieces of Exodia, focus on dueling.</p><p>If you have to end your turn and had activated Into the Void, set your spells beforehand. If you have Plaguespreader in GY, you might also be able to save a card from being discarded.</p><p>I know Pot of Avarice is a weird pick for a Exodia deck, but it can give a second chance to use Machine Duplication and/or Royal Library, and that is a chance to end the duel in the same turn.</p><p>If you don't like Cup of Ace, i left an alternative on the side deck. And if you want more discard fooder, Thunder Dragon is there too.</p>"

Penguins and Krawlers! What more do you need!,"<p>Hello again! This is part of a series of decks where I try to make as many Krawler-creations as I can, blending archetypes to find interesting and unusual builds! This build seeks to combine the Krawler's ability to flood the board and flip down monsters with Penguin's ability to summon Squire when we flip-down our monsters, opening up the possibility for Synchro plays. If you enjoy this list or my description, please check out some of the other decks I've build within this series! I'll be going through the archetypes, a deck breakdown, and combo lines down below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this deck, Krawlers are good for a few reasons: we can make Utopic Draco Future relatively easily, we can use Girso to set Deus X-Krawler and Pawns to our field, and we can make Winda off of a hand with Soma and Girsu. We are running a very trim Krawler package to accomplish this, and maxxing out on Small World to find our missing combo pieces. The Penguins allow us to go into Synchro plays off of Penguin Squire. Squire can special summon itself whenever we flip a card face-down, or summon it in face-down defense position, which we can do quite easily. This is really powerful, however Squire locks us into Water Synchro summons. At first this may seem like a hard wall, but remember, Halq is still legal! Squire and any other card becomes Halq and a search for another tuner (in this casel, Ghost Belle)! What this list is meant to do is show you the possibilities of this combination, and to do so we are running essentially no interruption or board breaking tools. This is probably not advisable for a more competitive build, but if we go first we can usually pop-off, given that the whole deck is just gas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, what are we playing? The Krawler portion of this list is just Deus X, 3 Soma, Spine and 2 Glial. Girsu is sort of an honorary Krawler, so we'll count them as well! We're on Mind Meld and Pawns for our Girsu / Lib combo. The Penguins make up the meat of this list. The Great Emperor Penguin is quite powerful, but also powerfully bricky so he stays at 1. Squire, on the other hand, is a card we always want to see, so they're at 3. One each of Nopenguin, Penguin Ninja, Puny Penguin, and Penguin Cleric round out our Penguin support core, and the 2 Penguin Soldier stand in as the Penguin we're going to be searching and setting a lot of. We run 3 Small World to search Soma, Girsu, or Squire, and Iblee, Mitsu, and Cartorhyn are our bridges. The Ghostrick / UDF package requires that we run Shot, and Scare is a nice card to grab off of the combo as well. Finally, we are running 3 Sol and Luna (a great flip card) and 3 Solemn Judgement (to stop our board from being broken). In the Extra Deck, we're on a small Shaddoll package to make Winda, the UDF package, I:P and Avramax, Lib, and Halq. The Synchros I wanted to run are Naturia Beast, Penguin Squire, Shooting Riser, and Chengying (mostly to synergize with the Nopenguin banishes).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What can this deck do? I'll go over some basic combos, and then work in our stronger combos that require more specific combinations of cards in hand.</p><p>Starting hand:</p><p>Soma and any normal-summonable monster: Normal the monster and activate Soma in hand, flipping down the monster and special-summoning Soma. Activate Soma to summon 1 Krawler face-up and 1 face-down. Overlay the face-up Krawler and Soma into Socuteboss, and overlay her into Angel of Mischief. Detatch Socuteboss to search Ghostrick Shot, then Shot back Socuteboss. Overlay her again for another Angel of Mischief, detatching again for Scare this time. Overlay the two Angels for Utopic Future, then again for Utopic Draco Future. End board is UDF, a set Krawler, and a set Scare.</p><p>Girsu: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld to GY. Activate Girsu to make a token on each field, then link off Girsu and the token for Lib. Activate Lib to set Pawns to the field, then activate the Mind Meld in GY to summon Deus X to the field.</p><p>Royal Penguins Garden: Activate the Garden, searching Emperor Penguin. Activate Garden again to reduce the level of Emperor and discard a card. Summon Emperor, then tribute them to summon Squire and Puny Penguin. Synch off these monsters for Penguin Brave, then use its effect to set Penguin Soldier to the field. If you drew the Puny Penguin, we can adjust so long as we draw / search Squire. Instead of summoning Puny and Squire off of Emperor, summon Ninja and Soldier. Use Ninja to flip-down Soldier which will allow you to special summon Squire, then you can lower Squire's level by 1. Activate Squire to flip-up Soldier (not activating its effect, unless the opponent has mons on board) and make Penguin Brave, setting another Soldier from deck to field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some more involved combo lines:</p><p>Soma and Girsu: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld, and make a token. Activate Soma to summon itself and flip-down Girsu. Use Soma to summon 2 face-up Krawlers, then link Soma and the token for Lib, setting Pawns with her effect. Link the two flip-Krawlers off for Construct, then use Construct's effect to fuse with Girsu to make Winda. Finally, activate Mind Meld in the GY to summon Deus X to a zone Lib points to.</p><p>Girsu and Penguin Squire: Perform the Girsu combo, but summon a level 2 Krawler off of Mind Meld, not Deus X. Your board should be Lib, Pawns set, and a set Krawler. When that Krawler is summoned, trigger Squire to summon itself, and reduce its level by 1. Activate Squire to flip-up the Krawler, then you can make Penguin Brave, setting Soldier from deck. You could also link the Squire and the Krawler away for I:P Masquerena and make Avramax. Alternatively, a potentially more powerful play would be to link Girsu and the token off for Atrifact Dagda, summoning the Krawler off of Mind Meld, activating Squire to summon itself. When Squire uses its on-field effect to reduce its level, use Dagda to set a Scythe from deck. This list doesn't contain these cards, to show more variety in potential combos, but you could make your own list using these lines.</p><p>Soma and Squire and a normal-summonable mon: Summon the monster and flip it down with Soma to summon Soma. On that flip-down, trigger Squire to summon Squire. Activate Soma to summon 1 face-up Krawler and 1 face-down Krawler, then link Soma and Squire off for Halq, summoning Ghost Belle from deck. Synch off the Ghost Belle and the face-up Krawler for Naturia Beast. This play gets much more powerful if you have Mitsu or Cartorhyn in hand. If you do, make sure to summon both Krawlers off of Soma face-up, then either summon Mitsu at the end of the combo, or Cartorhyn when you have face-up Water and Earth mons (remember, Halq is Water). Then, overlay these 2 face up mons (a Krawler and Mitsu/Cartorhyn) for Socuteboss, then follow the above combo to make UDF. End board, optimally, is Naturia Beast, Halq, and UDF. On the opponent's turn, Halq can tag out for Shooting Riser, who will send a level 2 mon to make their level 5. When the opponent has run out of Spells, or they are trying to move into the Battle Phase, synch Riser and Beast for Chengying.</p><p>Soma and Penguins Garden: You can either perform the Squire / Soma combo above, or a combo with Soma and Emperor. Activate the Garden, grabbing Nopenguin. Activate Garden's level lowering effect to reduce Emperor's level by discarding Nopenguin. Summon and tribute Emperor, which will trigger Nopenguin to summon itself. off of Emperor, summon Squire and Soldier. Flip Soldier down to summon Soma, then link off Squire and Nopenguin for Halq, summoning Ghost Belle. Activate Soma to summon 2 Krawlers. Your board should be similar to the one built in the combo above (Soma and Squire). This is your branch point, where depening on your cards in hand, you can either make Nat Beast, Halq, and two set mons, or Nat Beast, Halq, a set Soldier, and UDF.</p><p>One of the craziest hands this deck can produce is Soma, Girsu, Squire, and Garden: Activate Garden to grab Nopenguin, use Garden to decrease Squire's level by pitching Nopenguin. Summon Girsu, pitching Mind Meld and create a token, then flip Girsu down to summon Soma. Use Soma to summon 2 face-up Krawlers, then Make Lib with Soma and the token. Make Shaddoll Construct with the two face-up Krawlers, leaving an open space near where the link-arrow is pointed. Here you do one of two things, so remember this break-point. Lets play a bit safe, and summon Deus X off of Mind Meld to the open space near Construct. This lets us summon Squire from hand, which will trigger Nopenguin to summon itself from Gy. Reduce Squire's level by 1 so it will now be at 3 (the previous Garden activation lowered it by 1 as well), and you can synch off the penguins for Penguin Brave, summoning Soldier, then fusion summon Winda using Construct and the face-down Girsu. This creates a board with a face-down Soldier and Deus X, Penguin Brave, Winda, and Lib. Alternatively, at the break point, use Mind Meld to summon a level 2 Krawler from deck, then summon Squire and Nopenguin off of their triggers. Activate Squire to flip-up the face-down Krawler. Then, if you have an extender like Mitsu or Cartorhyn, get ready to summon them. Link Squire and Lib for Halq, summoning Ghost Belle who will Synch with the Krawler for Nat Beast. Summon your extender, then link them off with Nopenguiin for I:P Masquerena. Use I:P and Halq to make Avramax, then make Winda with Construct and the face-down Girsu. This end board is Avramax with I:P's protection, Naturia Beast, and Winda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whew! Enough of all that, here's the Small World Bridges:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Any Krawler / Any non-level 2 Water mon / Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Insect Ninja Mitsu&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Any non-level 2 Water / Iblee</p><p>Level 2 Krawler / Non-level 2 Water mon / Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Cartorhyn the Hidden Gem&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Level 2 Krawler / Non-level 2 Water Mon / Iblee</p><p>Any Level 2 Mon / Girsu / Ghost Belle -&gt;&nbsp; Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Level 2 Mon / Girsu / Ghost Belle</p><p>Any Krawler / Iblee -&gt;&nbsp; Ghost Belle&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler / Iblee</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This one was a long one! I hope its been a fun and interesting read, and if not that at least a goofy list that you can enjoy! I'd love to see your version of a Krawler Penguin list, or even combos that are more optimal that the ones I've given! Maybe you can come up with a list that makes stronger end-boards, or one that has more interruption and going-second tools? Whatever the case, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments! Thanks, and take care!</p>"

Not only do these cards make the Deck more consistent, but it also allows you to have easier access to the strongest part of your Deck that used to be inaccessible for years,&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Rainbow</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our Weather Painter monsters consist of 1&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Aurora</strong>, 3<strong> The Weather Painter Thunder</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Cloud</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Snow</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Rain</strong>. The Weather Painters have a playstyle where they are given additional effects from their Continuous Spell/Trap lineup based on what column they are in. They banish themselves for cost in order to activate these effects and return during the next Standby Phase.&nbsp;<strong>Aurora</strong> protects all of your Weather Painter Spells/Traps from being targeted or destroyed. You will almost never use her Normal Summon effect because you want to keep all of your Weather Painter monsters in rotation and using 1 for a Tribute Summon is not worth it.&nbsp;<strong>Thunder</strong> has the effect to send a Continuous Spell/Trap you control to the GY to place 1 The Weather Spell/Trap from your Deck in your Spell/Trap Zone. Notably, you cannot get&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Forcast</strong> with this effect since it has to place them in the Spell/Trap Zone which means that Field Spells are unapplicable. Also keep in mind that it also sends the card for cost, so you can use this to send a Floodgate you control to the GY to access your plays once you've hindered your opponent's plays enough.&nbsp;<strong>Cloud</strong> can target up to 2 The Weather Spells/Traps from your GY and place them face-up in your Spell/Trap Zone when another The Weather card you control is sent to the GY. It synergizes with&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Forcast</strong>'s effect to use your The Weather Spells/Traps as Link Material as <strong>Cloud </strong>just gets them right back.&nbsp;<strong>Snow</strong> places a The Weather Spell/Trap from your Deck face-up in your Spell/Trap Zone on Normal Summon which is really good for the Deck.&nbsp;<strong>Rain</strong> places a The Weather Spell/Trap from your hand face-up if it is Special Summoned. It is not very good, but it is another Weather Painter name at the very least and it is seemingly more playable than <strong>The Weather Painter Sun</strong>. We also play 3&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong> since there are many situations where your Weather Painters will not be on the field, so you don't suffer from&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru</strong> Tributing your own monsters.</span></p><p><span>For our Weather Spells/Traps, we play 3&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Snowy Canvas</strong>, 1<strong> The Weather Rainy Canvas</strong>, 3<strong> The Weather Forcast</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Rainbowy Canvas</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Thundery Canvas</strong>. The Weather Painter Continuous Spell/Traps give all Weather Painter monsters in your Main Monster Zones in the same column and the adjacent columns a unique effect.&nbsp;<strong>Snowy Canvas</strong> allows your Weather Painter to banish itself to search any The Weather Card from Deck.&nbsp;<strong>Rainy Canvas</strong> allows your Weather Painter to banish itself to return a Spell/Trap your opponent controls and you can keep on doing this if you have other Weather Painters who've gained the effect.&nbsp;<strong>Rainbowy Canvas</strong> banishes the Weather Painter to Special a Weather Painter from Deck if your opponent controls a monster.&nbsp;<strong>Thundery Canvas</strong> banishes the Weather Painter to return the monster its battling to the hand at the start of the Damage Step.&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Forcast</strong> is a Field Spell that places a Weather Spell/Trap from Deck face-up upon activation, it gives you an Extra Normal Summon of a Weather Painter, and it allows you to use your The Weather Spell/Traps as Link Material. This gives much more consistency as well as an easier way to access <strong>The Weather Painter Rainbow</strong>.&nbsp; We also play 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> to dig for cards, 1 <strong>Terraforming</strong> to search&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Forcast</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, 3 <strong>Skill Drain</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Strike</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Skill Drain&nbsp;</strong>is good as your Weather Painters banish themselves as cost, so they will not be hindered by <strong>Skill Drain</strong>. Your effects ""place"" The Weather Spell/Traps face-up instead of activating them, so&nbsp;<strong>Anti-</strong><strong>Spell</strong> doesn't hinder you either.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We will rarely go into the Extra Deck outside of our Weather Painter Link Monsters.&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong> are&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong> Targets as&nbsp;<strong>N'tss</strong> can destroy a card and&nbsp;<strong>Garura</strong> can Draw a card. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 49: Fortune Tune</strong> as an Xyz package. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Ocean Dragon - Zealantis</strong> and 1<strong> Accesscode Talker</strong>. Accesscode will not have that many pops since you are Link Summoning very little in this Deck, but it can be used as Material for&nbsp;<strong>Zealantis&nbsp;</strong>for for board-clearing.&nbsp;1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant</strong>, and 1<strong> Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous</strong>. You can play any combination of Charmer Links including&nbsp;<strong>Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Rainbow</strong> and 2&nbsp;<strong>The Weather Painter Moonbow</strong>. <strong>Rainbow</strong> can send itself to the GY to negate a Special Summon and it makes all of the Weather Painter monsters it points to into omni-negates.&nbsp;<strong>Moonbow</strong> floats into&nbsp;<strong>Rainbow</strong> on destruction and it allows the Weather Painters it points to the effect to banish a monster your opponent controls until the next Standby Phase. You mainly want to Summon&nbsp;<strong>Rainbow</strong> as it has more application, but&nbsp;<strong>Moonbow</strong> can come up and it even floats into&nbsp;<strong>Rainbow</strong> eitherway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Side Deck, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Kaijus</strong>, any of your choice, 1&nbsp;<strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong> for removal, 3<strong> Raigeki</strong>, 3 <strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Fissure</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Macro Cosmos</strong>.

Nemeses Keystone is necessary to recycle Misc and works perfectly with Gallant Granite (let's hope Misc will at least get back to 2 copies). Scrap Wyvern is important because it can help you to pop cards in the field (o.e your babycerasaurus or even opponent cards) and can help you extend and bring out more scrap monsters and build Apollousa with a respectable ammount of negates.Using Dark Ruler No More in the side deck, you can turn it into a Go-2nd Dino Deck and confuse the opponent. You can ditch the Super Poly / Predaplant / Starving Venom and Mystic Mine package in the side deck and use other cards of your personal choice. Gravedigger's Trap Hole is a good cheap alternative to deal with hand traps. If you are not on a budget of course you can use Nibiru and Ash as substitutes for the Effect Veilers (I recommend to not change the Psy-Frame Hand-trap line-up). Chain blocking with Lost World and Oviraptor is a nice start to combos and to prevent your dinos from getting their effects negated (either from Imperm or Handtraps). With Keystone and the Scrap Engine you can end up in a good board with many negates. Apollousa, Dolkka/Laggia, Naturia Beast and UCT is one nice example end board. Gallant Granite is helpful and can search you Keystone during your combos and manage to recycle Misc in a good flow. Dugares is helpful for OTKs (same goes for Pentestag). Furthermore, backrow removal is a must for the current meta (Twins, Tornado Dragon, Harpie's, Pankratops for either monsters or trap/spell cards etc.) so don't be hesitant to use the given options. Hope you liked my upload and of course any suggestions in order to make the deck better are welcome! Don't let the Dinos die in the current formats. :D&nbsp;</p>"

The xyz super quant's are quick effect when having the corresponding super quant under it, which in a casual format is pretty good. Deck's main weakness is hand traps sadly, so more than a two interactions and your most likely gonna struggle. The boss monster is pretty good if you can get to it as it can be unnafected by all card effects, meaning you can only kill it by a 3000+ monster.</p><p>Based off the youtube video, tried to make it more budget friendly for me including some cards I already have.&nbsp;</p>"

Sidedeck features a numeron engine to summon Megaclops if opponent doesn't have an out, and wall is a bad battle fader as well. Although the deck features a ton of ways to get into Mystic mine, due to the recent success of the Burn varient people will be siding more outs to the card, so I built a deck less reliant on mine in case they have too many outs to play the deck normally. Left the solemns and dark bribes in the side just in case they are needed games 2/3 but realistically they are not the focus of the deck.</p>"

This list sorta fits into that category, but I'm not going to be doing as in-depth a review as I normally would, as its mostly a proof-of-concept build to test out the inclusion of Magicians' Souls in the build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fairly standard Krawler build; we have the 3 Soma, 3 Girsu, Lib in the extra, and a variety of link plays. Where this list diverges is the inclusion of Magicians' Souls, a tech card used in many other builds like the BASED pile and Prank-Kids decks. This card can special summon itself by sending Illusion of Chaos from deck to GY, and Illusion of Chaos can be placed from hand to the top of the deck to search Magicians' Souls. Once Souls is on the field, we can use its effect to send up to 2 Spell/Trap cards from hand or field to GY. In this build, we use this effect to get rid of dead-draws or once-per-turn spells that we have already used, as well as to get Mind Meld from hand to GY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does this card help the consistency of a Krawlers build? Well, our main play on turn 1 is to normal summon Girsu, sending Mind Meld, then use Girsu to make a token. We flip Girsu down with Soma's effect, summoning Soma, then use Soma to summon 2 more Krawlers from deck, face-up. We link off Soma and the token for Lib, setting Pawns to the field with Lib's effect. Then we link off the 2 Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct and fuse Construct with the face-down Girsu for Winda. Finally, we activate Mind Meld in GY, banishing it to summon Deus X to a zone a link monster points to. This is a very solid open, but we can't always guarantee that we will draw both Soma and Girsu, even if we include Small World. With Magicians' Souls included, we have a greater chance of drawing into a dark that we can use with Soma to make Winda, and we can sometimes fix a bad hand by sending Spell/Traps to draw. If we open Soma and Souls, with any normal-summonable monster, we can special summon Souls and discard any excess or unusable cards to draw. Then, we flip down Souls to summon Soma, and use Soma to get 2 face-up Krawlers to the field. We summon our other monster in hand, then link them off with Soma for Lib, using her effect to search Pawns/Mind Meld. Link the 2 Krawlers for Construct, and fusion summon Winda with Construct and Souls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To take best advantage of Souls, we are running Cosmic Cyclone, which can be used from the GY to pop a face-up Spell/Trap (likely a floodgate/field spell). There are definitely arguments to be made about what fits and what does not in this list; Prosperity, a Spright/Frog package, and then there's the budget consideration. Speaking of budget, I'll start with that: I know this build is obscenely expensive for a Krawler list. If you wanted to run this list, but found the price prohibitive, you could always trim the Magicians' Souls and Illusion of Chaos to 1 a-piece. Also, there are many budget alternatives to extra deck staples, potentially using Pitknight Earlie as a substitute for Apollousa and Borrelsword instead of Zeus/Avramax. Pot of Prosperity is not just the most expensive card in the list, but it also lacks synergy with Magicians' Souls. If we use Prosperity, we can't draw off of Souls, and vice versa. We could try Extravagence, but I think Pot of Desires is the budget/alternative pick for this list. It does run the chance of hitting vital cards to our combo, but it is a +1 in card advantage, and it can always be used partially through our combo, once we have searched the necessary cards, to provide resources for next turn or extend our play. Another option, which will only add to the large price on this deck, is running a small Spright/Frog package. The advantage of this package is that if you don't find Souls or Girsu, you can still make Toadally Awesome and Spright Elf. This could be done with 1 Blue, 1 Jet, 1 Carrot/Red, 2 Starter, 2 Swap Frog, and 1 Ronintoadin. I don't think this is a good fit for the list, since we would be forced to choose between making Winda and making Toad, but it is an option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just to clarify a choice; Iblee is in the deck as a possible Small World bridge, but also to summon off of Gigantic Spright and then link into Spright Elf/I:P Masquerena if we draw Soma and don't find Girsu or Souls. Maybe this should be taken out of the list, but I like their inclusion for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World bridges:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Any Krawler (but Axon) / Souls / World Armor / Girsu&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Magical Hound&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Krawler (but Axon) / Souls / World Armor / Girsu</p><p>Any Level 2 Krawler / Illusion of Chaos / World Armor&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Iblee&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Level 2 Krawler / Illusion of Chaos / World Armor</p><p>Girsu / Iblee / Soma&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Illusion of Chaos&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu / Iblee / Soma</p><p>Magical Hound / Souls / Girsu / Soma&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; World Armor&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Magical Hound / Souls / Girsu / Soma</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I got a bit carried away on this one; I just meant to write a short summary! But I am glad I was able to spend some time on alternatives for the list, something that I wish more decklists included! Right now its very tricky to play yugioh on a moderate budget with several staples exceeding the $50 mark, and some propelling past $100 (US dollar). As always, please let me know what you thought! Do you agree with the list, disagree with the choices I made, or do you have an idea for a totally wild build that could use this core? Thanks for reading, and have a great day!</p>"

Absurd value.</span></p><p><span>Their gimmick being that to activate their effects they have to pop a card in your hand and start amassing advantage form that since all have effects when destroyed by card effects. Thus it meant that you'll go way down in card advantage to even begin to play like any other deck, and being a ritual deck just made it worse. This all changed with a relatively new piece of support and a series of design choices Konami has made that lead to this slow gimmick to turn into a hodgepoge of value.</span></p><p><span>It all starts with Conductor of Nephthys, one of the most insane pieces of support ever printed. It special summons a Nephthys ritual monster from the deck and treats it like a ritual summon, thus allowing it to trigger it's effects. The one you'll always going to summon is Devotee, which when ritual summoned summons another non-ritual Nepthys from the deck. This being Disciple, which by destroying a card in your hand searchs Matriarch which can revive a Nephthys monster from the GY. This guarantees four monsters on the field with a single ritual summon, but also makes Conductor the biggest hand trap target in the planet. But what if you'r opponent used all of them before you get Conductor on the field?</span></p><p><span>All Nephthys monsters worth a dime are level two, giving you access to Gigantic Spright and Spright Elf. You know which other monsters are level two as well? Diviner of the Heralds and Cyber Egg Angel. These two fixes one of the biggest weaknesses of the deck: getting to their ritual spell. And thanks to the Elf and Gigantic you don't have to commit to a normal summon for it. Diviner bieng the absolute best, by giving you the flexibility of a search or a pop by sending Arc Lights or N'tss. Meanwhile, Egg searches Ritual Sanctuary which not only hard ritual summons, but trades extra copies of Spright Starter or Rebirth of Nephthys (which through the course of your combo are most likely to have) for an extender and recycles them. The last Nephthys monster I also want to point out is Chaos Nephthys. By using Elf to revive Diviner during your opponent's turn and sending N'tss to pop a card they control, you can revive Chaos by banishing a light and a dark to also banish a card on the field and two from their GY, while also giving you an extra body for Masquerena into Apollousa.</span></p><p><span>The combo lines vary depening of the amount of Sprights you have, but as long as you can resolve Gigantic or Conductor you can go full combo.</span></p><p><strong><span>By having Conductor or a way to get to it (like Preparation) and Spright Starter your combo may look something like this (also keep in mind your zone placement):</span></strong></p><p><em><span>Spright Starter &gt; Summon Blue &gt; Search Jet and summon it &gt; Search another Starter &gt; XYZ summon Gigantic Spright &gt; Summon Diviner (and prevent Nibiru) &gt; Send Herald of Arc Lights and search Rebirth of Nephthys &gt; Ritual summon Conductor by tributing Diviner &gt; CH1 Conductor, CH2 Diviner &gt; Summon Egg and Devotee &gt; CH1 Devotee, CH2 Egg &gt; Search Ritual Sanctuary and summon Disciple &gt; Disciple effect to search Matriarch &gt; Use Disciple and Devotee to link summon the nephthys link &gt; Search Chaos nephthys with it and recycle your ritual spell &gt; Use the effect of Devotee to revie itself by destroying Chaos Nephthys in your hand &gt; Link Devotee and the Nephthys link into Elf &gt; Elf revives Diviner and link it and Eff into Halqifibrax to summon The Agent of Mystery - Earth &gt; Link Earth and Gigantic into Pitknight Earlie &gt; Finally, normal summon Matriarch and use her effect to revive any Nepthys level two in your GY and link summon Masquerena.</span></em></p><p><span>Now during your opponent's turn you can use Elf to revive Diviner to send N'tss and pop a card, thus triggering Chaos Nephthys in your GY to revive itself and banishing three cards (keep in mind that for it to trigger there also needs to be a card on the other field for it to banish). You can use Halqifibrax effect to go into Formula Synchron, draw one card and synchro it and the remaining level two on your field for a Herald of Arc Lights (you could also make Baronee, but the extra deck is extremely small and decided to keep the utility of Arc Light over Baronee). At this point, depending on where you placed Pitknight you could've also negated a monster's effect as well. Finally you use Masquarena to go into Apollouse with the remaining materials on the field and swing for game with Accesscode on the crackback.</span></p><p><span>The biggest downsides of this version of the deck is that you trade space for handtraps in favor of combo pieces. The deck lives and dies by their ritual spell. If you get prevented of getting to it, you're absolutely dead. The extra deck is extremely tight and since you play with a bunch of one-offs Prosperity is the better option over Desires, but there are games where I used it and found myself in really need of the cards I banished on the following turn (this version straight up vomits your whole extra deck). Possibly the most annoying yet funny downside is that all the monsters are really, really small. If your opponent manages to survive until the batttle phase and has a monster with more than 1600 atk you're kinda screwed. If konami prints a XYZ monster with a lingering effect that pumps your other monsters even by just 500 atk it would seriously consider playing it over Accesscode.</span></p>"

This is another deck in a series where I try to build as many different P.U.N.K. builds as I can, pushing my creativity and deck-building skills in the process! This build blends Krawlers new ability to summon out lots of bodies with Soma, with P.U.N.K. synchro-summon toolbox! This list is far from final, and can most definitely be improved, but I hope it serves as inspiration for someone to come along and one-up this build! To start, I'll go over what the disparate parts of this deck do and how they work together, my reasoning for the ratios, combo lines, and thoughts on what can be added/improved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Krawlers, and honorary Krawlers (looking at you, Girsu), have a lot of potential in deckbuilding, but rely on solid support. The Krawler Extra Deck mons, which I love dearly, do not make for a very strong endboard. Really, the area where Krawlers seem to struggle the most is in taking advantage of their resources on-board. You can easily get three mons onto the board with Soma's effect, and can guarantee a Deus X summon and a link-2 off of Girsu, but they usually rely on Shaddoll Construct, the Ghostrick UDF package, or generic link climbing to make and break boards. P.U.N.K.s have one of the most open extra decks in the game, as long as we're talking about Synchros! Powerful bosses like Psychic End Punisher, and resource fountains like Chaos Ruler, are as easy for P.U.N.K. to make as summoning tuners is for Halq, who they can also access very readily. When we combine these strengths, we can pretty reliably end on strong end boards; one example being Baronne/Chengying, Naturia Beast, Winda, Halq, a set Deus X, a set Pawns, and a set Dangerous Gabu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To fit everything in, and still give this deck a good grind-game, I had to play with the ratios for this deck. We want to see Soma and Girsu as often as possible, so we run them at 3. The P.U.N.K. engine is one place where we save space, playing one-a-piece, except for Deer Note and Foxy Tune who we have at 2. We are on Garbage Lord as a level 5 extender, 2 Garbage Lords and 2 Garbage Ogres. The hand traps, whose place in the deck is debatable, are Ghost Ogre and Ghost Belle at 2 a piece. These can be Small World bridges, but we also don't want to see multiples in our opening hands, so we just run them at 2. Dark Ruler, however, is much more powerful in the current meta, and I feel it warrants its ratio of 3. 2 Pot of Avarice may seem suspect, but we use it to recover our resources to make follow-up plays on our future turns. The Extra Deck will be shown more fully in the combo section, but one piece of tech that I'm not sold on yet is Desert Locusts. We summon them with Halq on the opponent's turn, discarding a card from their hand and letting us Synchro summon a mon. I feel like it under-performs, but I want to do more testing before replacing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Combos! In a P.U.N.K. build you know there are going to be lots of combos, and lots of steps in each combo, so lets get to it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Starter(s): combo-&gt;</p><p>Soma and a non-starter mon (non-Ze Amin low level P.U.N.K., Krawler, Garbage Lord, etc): Summon the non-starter monster, and flip them down to special summon Soma. Use Soma to summon 2 Krawlers from deck, both face-down. End the turn, and hope for the best! This one is kind of a joke; we should rarely find ourselves in a scenario where we have no extenders or starters in our hand. In a more pure Krawler build, this hand is much more powerful, as we can make an Extra Deck Krawler that floats on removal, or Subterror Behemoth Fiendess, who summons another flip-mon from hand. This build sacrifices those possibilities for a greater potential payoff at the end of the combo.</p><p>Soma and Girsu (and nothing else): Summon Girsu, sending Mind Meld from deck to GY on summon. Use Girsu to make a token, then flip down Girsu to summon Soma and use Soma to summon 2 Krawlers face-up. Link Soma and the token off for Lib, and use Lib to set Pawns to the field. Link the 2 Krawlers off for Shaddoll Construct and use her effect to fusion summon Winda, using herself and the face-down Girsu as material. Activate Mind Meld in the GY, banishing itself to set Deus X-Krawler to the field. We end on Lib, Winda, set Deus X, and a set Pawns.</p><p>Just a P.U.N.K. starter: So, to explain, a P.U.N.K. starter is Ze Amin, Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance, or Emergency Teleport, but there are other starters that require more cards in hand. For this combo, we assume that only one of these three have been drawn. If you have Ogre Dance, use it to search Ze Amin, and if you have E-Tele summon Ze Amin. I'll explain the Foxy Tune line after this, as it is a bit different. Activate Ze Amin to search Foxy Tune, then use Foxy Tune to summon a P.U.N.K. The simplest P.U.N.K. to summon is Deer Note, as then you can make Chaos Ruler, bring back Ze Amin, and make Psychic End Punisher, but I prefer to use the Sharakusai line. In that case, summon Sharakusai with Foxy Tune. If you started with only Foxy Tune in hand, use them to special summon Ze Amin, then use Ze Amin to add Ogre Dance, who then can add Sharakusai, who you can then normal summon. There! Both of the combo lines have converged. You should have a Ze Amin and a Sharakusai on field. Use Sharakusai to summon Rising Carp with Ze Amin, and use Carp's effect to summon 2 mons from deck. Summon Wa Gon/Madame Spider and Deer Note, then Synch these two off for Jam Dragon or Chaos Ruler. Chaos Ruler can draw you some cards, and you can get another piece of interruption on field or in hand, so in this case I prefer it, but Jam Dragon can do much the same. Either way, summon the mon, activate the effects on summon, and the Deer Note in GY, summoning back Sharakusai. If you summoned Jam Dragon, I would advise the mon you get off of Carp to be Wa Gon, so that you can find the field spell before activating Jam Dragon and draw 2 more cards (1 from Jam, 1 from Madame Spider, searched off of Jam), in addition to the Trap searched off of Madame Spider. Here you can make Psychic End Punisher, or if you make Chaos Ruler, Halq, who then summons Ghost Ogre (she can use her effect on field during the opponent's turn). Reborn Chaos Ruler using its effect, then you can either make Psychic End on your turn, or Amazing Dragon on the Opponent's. Whew! That was a lot of text, sorry for that. EDIT: Also, any lv8 and Halq on board can mean Baronne/Chengying if you tag out the Halq for Formula Synchron.</p><p>The other P.U.N.K. starters: So, if you have Sharakusai and another P.U.N.K. in hand, or a P.U.N.K. with our extender in hand (Garbage Lord), we can still pop off! If you have Sharakusai, summon them, then use their effect to make Carp. Use Carp to get Ze Amin and Deer Note, and search Foxy Tune with Ze Amin. Here you can make either Jam Dragon, Chaos Ruler, or both! If you want to make one or the other, follow the steps in the guide above (though you may not have the field spell for Jam Dragon), but if you want to make both use the Foxy Tune in hand to summon another Deer Note from deck. Now, use the Ze Amin and a Deer Note to make Chaos Ruler, summoning Sharakusai off of the Deer Note's effect. Make Halq with Sharakusai and Chaos Ruler, summoning a level 3 Tuner (any of our Tuners), and summon back Chaos Ruler if it behooves you. Use that tuner and the second Deer Note to make Jam Dragon, searching a lv 3 P.U.N.K., or use that tuner and Chaos Ruler to make an Amazing Dragon / Psychic End. If you have the Jam Dragon or Chaos Ruler and Halq, you can tag out the Halq to get a Formula Synchron and make Chengying or Baronne. If you have Garbage Lord and a P.U.N.K. in hand, summon both, make Chaos Ruler, and hopefully</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now we get into the meaty combos!</p><p>Girsu and E-Tele: Girsu eats our normal summon, so we need a special summon to extend our combo with him. Perform the Girsu combo, summoning, sending Mind Meld to GY, make and link with your token for Lib, use lib to set Pawns, and use Mind Meld to set Deus X. Okay, now you can use Emergency Teleport to summon Ze Amin. Ze Amin searches Foxy Tune, which can either summon Deer Note, or summon Sharakusai who later searches Deer Note through Carp. Once you have a lv 3 P.U.N.K. and Deer Note, you can do one of the final P.U.N.K. plays from the previous section; Ending with Chaos Ruler, Halq, a set Deus, and a set Dangerous Gabu.</p><p>Soma and a P.U.N.K. starter: The goal here is to get to Chaos Ruler and Halq, so perform the P.U.N.K. combo with that in mind, making Chaos Ruler, summoning back Sharakusai off of Deer Note's effect, then link them off for Halq, summoning a lv3 Tuner. Summon back Chaos Ruler with their effect, then flip them down with Soma to summon Soma. Use Soma to summon 2 Krawlers face-up, then synch Soma and the lv3 Tuner for Naturia Beast. Link the 2 Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct, then use Construct and the face-down Chaos Ruler to make Winda.</p><p>Soma, Girsu, and E-Tele: Summon Girsu, sending Mind Meld, then create the token, use Soma to summon itself by flipping down Girsu. Use E-Tele to summon Ze Amin, searching Foxy Tune with Ze, summon Sharakusai off of Foxy, fuse Sharakusai and Ze Amin for Carp, then use Carp to fetch Wa Gon and Deer Note. Get the field spell with Wa Gon, then Synch for Chaos Ruler, summoning back Sharakusai with Deer Note. Link Sharakusai and Deer note for Halq, summoning a lv 3 Tuner, then summon 2 Krawlers with Soma. Use Soma and the Tuner to make Naturia Beast, then link the 2 Krawlers for Construct. Bring back Chaos Ruler using their effect, and then make Winda with Construct and Girsu. An end board with Nat Beast, Winda, Halq, and Chaos Ruler. You can summon Formula Synchron on the opponent's turn, but you cannot make Baronne/Chengying unless the opponent destroys Winda first.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World Bridges:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; End</p><p>Any Earth / Any Machine&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Magical Hound&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Earth / Any Machine</p><p>Ghost Ogre/Belle / Girsu / Orochi / Ogre Dance / Necro&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Garbage Lord&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Ghost Ogre/Belle / Girsu / Orochi / Ogre Dance / Necro</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay! Finishing thoughts; I think the combination of these engines really opens up a lot of Synchro potential for the Krawlers, and gives P.U.N.K.s a very interesting extender in Soma. This combination makes very menacing end-boards and can tool-box you out of many scenarios. However, there is an extreme weakness to Dark Ruler / Forbidden Droplet in this list, so maybe we should be siding Blizzard or Judgement. Anyways, what did you think? Hopefully this deck description has been informative and helpful, or at least entertaining! If you have any thoughts on what could be done differntly for this deck, or other ways to use this combination, please let me know! I really appreciate you, and hope you have a good day!</p>"

Also happens to be Anti-Spright because of Drytron Fafnir.,"<p>This is a fun idea I had and decided to share. It's not the best deck considering Ritual is one of the worst monster types, but when it pops off, which is decently often, it gets the job done. And it's quite simple making it easy for beginners to understand as the combo can be as small as merely activating 3 cards. This deck is an Amorphactor pain the Imagination dracoverlord/Rescue-ACE Turbulance lockdown deck. Basically, Skip your opponent's main phase 1and by extention battle phase, you have a Trap set that negates a monsters effects and renders it unuseable as material, a trap set that destroys a monster and negates it's effects in the gy, essentially a set quick play monster reborn, and if any of your cards are removed from the field because of your opponents card effect Turbulance will destroy a card. Sometimes Dogmatika Maximus also ends up on the board giving you the ability to add ritual pieces, draw cards, destroy spells/traps/monsters, and even shuffle a card back to your opponents deck. You must be wondering about the deck's anti-Spright mechanic though. It takes the form of Drytron Fafnir, a field spell that makes all face up monsters loose 1 level for every 1000ATK they have. This means Spright, the level 2 spam deck, cant level 2 spam as they are all level 1 while on the field. This also disables their tech such as Spright Smashers, and prevents them from making Toadally Awesome. This also hurts Synchro decks like Swordsoul some. The drawback to it is you need a Drytron monster on the feild. So There are 2 Side decked Drytron Ritusl monsters in case you go up against Spright and co. Anywho though, onto Combos, How to side deck for this deck, and Cards to swap in if the deck isn't quite working for you!:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Basic Combo</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>So you want a way to summon Pain and Turbulance, Hydrant too if possible. Thats the decks sole goal. To do this, you need Drytron Meteonis, Amorphactor Pain, and either 2 Turbulance or 1 Turbulance and a Way to revive it. so the entire deck is built around searching these cards. So here's how you get each card you need.</p><p>Hydrant; Hydrant activates the second half of your set spell/trap effects, and lets you add Turbulance. So these are your ways of searching it, and by extension searching Turbulance.</p><ul><li>You can alwayse just end up drawing Hydrant</li><li>Gizmek naganaki can tribute itself to special summon Hydrant from the deck</li><li>Piri reis map can add Hydrant from your deck to your hand, but it's effects are negated until you normal summon it</li><li>One for One sends a monster from your hand to the GY to special summon it from the deck</li><li>Pot of Prosperity lets you search the top 6 cards of your deck, and add 1 of the 6 cards to your hand</li><li>Games 2 and 3 you can search for it by using Small world</li></ul><p>Amorphactor pain; The Ritual monster that does half the lockdown, Drytron Meteonis can summon it from the hand OR gy, luckily pain is a dragon, so there are plenty of ways to send it from the deck to the gy.</p><ul><li>Again, you can alwayse draw it</li><li>Dragon shrine can send it from the deck to the gy</li><li>Foolish burial can send it from the deck to the gy</li><li>Dragon ravine lets you discard a card to send it from the deck to the gy, in the instance you need another Rescue-Ace card in the gy to pay the cost to summon Turbulance, this discard effect Saves your combo</li><li>Terraforming searches Dragon Ravine, Dragon ravine searches it</li><li>Nadir servant &amp; Dogmatika Maximus can send Herald of the Arc Light from your extra deck to the GY, Herald can add Pain from your deck to your hand</li><li>Prosperity</li><li>Games 2 and 3 you can use small world, but you generally use Small World to add the Drytron monsters</li></ul><p>Lastly, Meteonis Drytron;</p><ul><li>Draw it</li><li>Fafnir adds it from your deck to your hand</li><li>Nadir/Maximus &amp; Herald add it from your deck to your hand</li><li>Terraforming adds Fafnir, Fafnir adds it</li><li>prosperity</li><li>Games 2 and 3 it and the Drytron Ritual monster can both be searched at the same time with Pre-Preparation of rites</li></ul><p>So onto the actual combo. In the most basic form possible, Activate Meteonis Drytron to Tribute turbulance from your hand to Ritual summon Pain from your hand. Next activate Rescue/Monster reborn to special summon Turbulance from your gy. Activate Turbulance effect to set 4 Rescue-ACE quick play spells/Traps from your deck and pass your turn. Though it can get as complicated as Normal summon Hydrant and add Turbulance, Then link Hydrant off for Salamangreat Almiraj, then link that off for secure Guardna. Banish Almiraj to summon Maximus. Have maximus send Herald and Garura to add Meteonis Drytron and draw a card, Use dragon ravine to discard a Rescue-ACE card to send Pain from the deck to the gy, then ritual summon it. Finally either banish both Rescue ACE cards from your Gy to summon a second Turbulance, or Revive turbulance via Rescue/Monster reborn/World legacy Succession and set 4 cards. Not exactly a complex deck. But heres two reminders before I go on to the next segement as I end up forgetting these sometimes. As Pain can be summoned from the gy, It is a safe discard target for any of your discard effects so Don't forget that and worry about not having discard targets. Don't forget that if you need Hydrant in the gy as a banish target, link it off for Almiraj/Relinquished anima BEFORE activating Nadir servant or Maximus's effect.&nbsp;</p><p>That's it on combos for now, though some more will come up later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to side deck:</strong></p><p>This deck is Tight on space, so to save you some trouble, I decided to add a segement on how to side deck with disrupting consistency as little as possible. You don't have to take out the exact cards for exact cards, moreso the cards you take out are the 15 least essential when swaping play style.</p><p>-1 Terraforming +1Red Reboot</p><p>-3 Dragon Ravine +3 Pre-preparation of rites</p><p>-3 Dragon shrine +3 Small world</p><p>-2 World Legacy Succession +2 Drytron Ritual monsters</p><p>-1 Alert -1 Foolish Burial _1Monster reborn +3 Effect Veiler</p><p>-1 One For One -1Pain -1 Rescue +3 Dark Ruler No More</p><p>NOTE that you Don't want to side deck all 15 if ypu don't have to or it cuts consistency to two thirds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cards to swap in &amp; experiment with:</strong></p><p>This version of the deck is just the one I have found most consistent at this singular goal, But with how many cards can fit with the deck, and how many other goals the deck could cram in, this version is likely far from the best the deck could be. So I may end up posting a second decklist in the Future, but for now, Here's a list of cards to start off your experiments if you end up enjoying the deck.</p><p>Tanuki Package-</p><p>Emporer Tanuki's Critter count is a level 1 monster searchable by Piri reis map. This little guy lets you use Cyber End Dragon as Ritual material if you can't afford to send your Turbulance as material. If you play this, you can't summon Hydrant, and are likeley playing a version that can afford wasting turn 1 to set up for turn 2, so you can use Where arf thou to add Hydrant if you control Tanuki, but you take 2000 damage since you can't summon it.</p><p>Fusion cards-</p><p>This deck allready plays from Garura, and benifits from discarding. So you can play Super Poly and a Mud dragon to make more use of the card, as a Duelist Stuck playing Branded at the moment, I can say it's definately a great card to consider. Especially since Garura can help make the final blow with it's double battle damage, and Mudragon's effect has saved me on more than one occasion.</p><p>Set up cards-</p><p>Having a little trouble getting everything you need turn 1? these will help for your build that can handle taking a hit to set up. Normal summon Cyber Dragon Core to add Cyber repair plant from your deck to your hand. Then link it off for Salamangreat Almiraj so you can activate Repair aplant, and use that to add gizmek Naganaki from your deck to your hand. As previously stated, Where arf thou can add any level 1 monster from your deck to your hand. Ritual Sanctuary can add Drytron Ritual monsters or Meteonis Drytron from your deck to your hand. Gadget Gamer can add Hydrant from your deck to your hand when normal summoned.</p><p>Spam package-</p><p>You can use Machine dupe to summon 2 Hydrant from your deck if you allready control one. use one as link material, then use the link monster and another for Cross-Sheep. Since the first one added Turbulance, and 2 are in your gy, you can summon Turbulance with it's effect. Then, if you Ritual summon, Cross-Sheep lets you optimize your hand, If you play Super Poly, you can afford to use your last hydrant as link material for whichever link-1 you didn't summon, and Super poly will trigger cross-sheep to summon Hydrant from the gy. Gizmek Arakami Can special summon it while you controll Hydrant/Naganaki/Turbulance/ Drytron ritual monster, and be used as cross sheep material. Furthermore, it can be banished from the gy to give your monster 300ATK/DEf to send Gizmek Tainguku from the deck to the gy. Tainguku can revive your machines by banishing itself.</p><p>Others-</p><p>Rescue-ACE air hoister can search Rescue for a revive based combo. It can be searched with reinforcement of the army and infernoble arms durendal.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a machine based deck, It can use Therion king regulus and Therion Discolosseum for a negate and battle protection.</p><p>The entirety of the Rescue-ACE and Gizmek Archtypes are perfect for experimenting with since this is a Rescue ACE deck afterall.(PS: Kaiju's Trigger Rescue-ACE fire engine, and give you control of what you can summon with Gizmek Uka. if you experiment with kaiju i reccomend Dogoran since It's FIRE attribute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thats all on this deck for now, as always, Enjoy!</p>"

It's still the same concept as the last one, do generic Branded things alongside Dark Simorgh to stop D-Barrier and dinomorphia/eldlich with a Dogmatika Maximus backup play. I just fixed the consistency by fixing the Simorgh engine and adding more Discarders. Also Alba-Lenatus DPE because once I broke boards, I couldn't deal enough damage for game, so this helps keep boards suppressed for long enough.

This is one more list in a series of decks I'm making to push the Krawler archetype to its limit and push myself creatively! In this series, I try to mix one or more archetypes or engines with the Krawler archetype, sometimes leaning more on the Krawlers and sometimes only including a minimal package. If you find this list enjoyable or informative, please check out the other Krawler lists that I have uploaded! I like to start by talking a bit about the general strategy behind the archetypes, spend a little time on the individual cards in the deck and the ratios of those cards, and finally talk about the possible combos and Small World bridges, which we usually play because I want to highlight Soma!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, Krawlers and Melffys; what do they do separately and how do they work together? Well, Krawlers have a great ability to extend plays and get Lv2 mons on the field, as of the new Soma support. This can be used to make Xyz mons like Utopic Draco Future using the Ghostrick line, and searching Ghostrick Scare along the way, or to facilitate any number of link play. Melffys used to play a slow game, similar to Krawlers before Soma, mostly focused around Puppy summoning Kalantosa to pop a card. With the release of Melffy Wally and Melffy Pinny, however, Melffys now have a lot of combo potential! Wally can summon 2 Mellfys from the deck with different names, letting us set up multiple effects on the opponent's turn, and get Catty, who can search Pinny. Pinny is the real powerhouse; as long as you have returned a Beast monster to the hand (which you will be doing frequently), you can special summon them from your hand, then perform a Synchro summon using Pinny and any number of Melffys in your hand! Also, this is a quick effect, and as such can be activated on the opponent's turn! As you can imagine, this lets us access quite a few sources of interruption on the opponent's turn. Krawlers can certainly help with interruption, but where the real synergy in this list lies is a card named Guard Dog. Guard Dog is a flip monster who, when flipped up, prevents the opponent from special summoning for the rest of the turn. Normally, using Guard Dog in a Krawler list is very hit-or-miss, as we have no way of searching it, and the card is much more at home in Prediction Princesses, as they can both summon it from deck to the field, and flip it up. What we have in this list that we would not have in just pure Melffy or pure Krawler is the ability to use Rescue Cat to search Guard Dog, flip it down with Soma, then make UDF and set the Ghostrick Scare we searched as part of that combo to flip up Guard Dog on our opponent's turn! This, combined with the Melffy interruption and the UDF negation/stealing, lets us stop our opponent in their tracks and usually OTK on our next turn!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because we want to see Soma and Rescue cat as often as possible, we are running both at 3, as well as running a small core of Krawlers to support Soma (Receptor, Glial, and Spine). We're on 2 Guard Dog, as they are searchable off of Rescue Cat, and a brick unless we also draw Soma or Scare. The Ghostrick Scare and Shot are here to facilitate the climb from Socuteboss to Angel, to Utopic Draco Future, and the Scare lets us flip up our monsters on the opponent's turn. Most pure Melffy lists run Obedience Schooled, as it is a great way to start your plays and it lets you make Halq, going into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on your opponent's turn, but our floodgate is Guard Dog, and we don't want the redundancy. 2 Kalantosas are just enough (we want to make sure we don't draw them, but if we do draw one we want another in deck), and we are also on 1 Hop Ear Squadron and 1 Valerifawn to help with our Synchro lines by summoning and Synching on the opponent's turn and reborning a monster, respectively. The Melffys are 1 Pony (recursion), 3 Puppy (summons Kalantosa from deck), 2 Pinny (searchable off Catty), 2 Catty (searchable off Wally), and 3 Wally (the main starter). To recycle cards, we are on 1 Hide-and-Seek, and to search our Wally we are on 2 Staring Contest. The 3 Alpha, Master of Beasts are here as a good going-second tool, as well as a backup plan if our opponent breaks our board. They can bounce the opponent's monsters and are big enough to contest quite a few threats. We play 2 Magical Hounds for our Small World (at 3) bridge, they can help us to find Soma/Rescue Cat, but sometimes we also get to use their effect to bounce an opponent's Spell/Trap! This could be used to remove a floodgate like Mystic Mine, or remove a Field Spell like Pelereino that could destroy our cards. In the Extra Deck we are on 1 each Joyous Melffys (summon back 2 Melffys to start our plays) and Melffy of the Forest (search Wally). We are on the UDF package, and the rest are all Synchros. Chengying and Satellite Warrior are our 10s (swap in Baronne for Chengying if you can afford to), Draco Berserker and the Stardusts are our 8s, Desert Locusts lets us climb into the rest of our list, and Merry Melffys is a great backup plan. Allvain is a good backup plan if our Rescue Cat gets negated, and it can start our Synchro lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our most optimal open is Rescue Cat, Soma, and Wally in hand. We normal Rescue Cat, then send them to the GY to special summon Guard Dog and Wally from deck. Soma flips-down Guard Dog to special itself from hand, then summon Receptor and Spine/Glial from the deck face-down. Use Soma and Wally to make Socuteboss, go into Angel, detatch Socuteboss to search Shot. Use Shot to reborn Socuteboss, then make your second Angel and detatch to search Scare. Overlay both Angels for Utopic Future, then Utopic Draco future, in the Extra Monster Zone. During your End Step, use the Wally in hand to summon itself to the field. During the opponent's turn, either in their Draw/Standby phase if you fear removal, or their Main Phase if you don't, flip up Guard Dog and Receptor with Scare (you could wait until the opponent summons a monster first, if you want to pop it with Spine [Spine can also pop itself to make room for your Synchro summons]). When the opponent does summon a monster, return Wally to hand to summon Catty and Puppy from deck. If the opponent negated or is able to play through the Guard Dog (Floowandereeze), use Catty to search Pinny and Puppy to summon Kalantosa to pop a card the opponent controls. Use Pinny to summon itself, then either make Merry Melffys, or start our Synchro plays with Desert Locusts, which will rip a card out of the opponent's hand, then let you Synchro summon again. Use the Desert Locusts and the Kalantosa on field to make Draco Berserker or Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon. If you make Accel, then tag out for Stardust Dragon, summoning back Pinny from GY. Use Pinny and Stardust to make Satellite/Chengying/Baronne, depending on what the situation calls for. Alright, I know this is just one combo, but you can perform many of the summons described in it using only Soma, or Rescue cat (search 2 Melffys, make Joyous, summon back Melffys on the opponents turn), and even just a Wally in hand can lead to quite a lot of interraction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Small World Bridges:</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal</p><p>Any Earth (almost the whole deck)&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Magical Hound&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Any Earth</p><p>Lv2 Krawler / Guard Dog / Alpha&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Hop Eared Squadron&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Lv2 Krawler / Guard Dog / Alpha</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

What more do you want from me,"<p>Suships are an incredibly fun and strong XYZ-spam strategy. They excel at special summoning themselves and accruing more advantage while doing so. They have a lot going for them in that every extra deck cards has multiple strong effects, they have insane crackback power/potential, and they have an amazing boss in uni super dreadnought who can target cards up to the number of suship extra deck monsters you have and negate their effects forever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main issues arise when you realize that every single one of the extra deck suships effects are conditional upon what they have attached to them. This makes them very difficult to play optimally. On top of this, the super strong effect of uni super dreadnought can only be used during your main phase or your opponent&rsquo;s battle phase, hindering this super strong effect a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To compensate for this people have tried many things from mixing them with time thiefs to using it as a zeus engine (as uni super dreadnought can attach directly). I have found, however, that a control variant is the most optimal way to play suships. This is because every extra deck monster draws you a card as long as you use a shari to make it, giving you insane value and advantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things that are not optimal about my build:</p><p>Kaijus - While I like them, Kaijus are not the best. I find that they are only good when your opponent only gets out one towers and you can flip gozen on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Chaos Hunter - So we like to disrupt with banishing... but we also don't want to get runic murdered... This single card is necessary given the current landscape, but be careful when siding as it can mess up your shifter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things that are optimal/cool:</p><p>Ice dragon&rsquo;s prison is actually amazing in the current format, being able to shut down most boards and absolutely ruin a tear players day&nbsp;</p><p>Megaclops is an amazing towers that works super well with this deck</p><p>Shifter is wonderful in this deck for the same reasons its great in exosisters</p><p>Carrier&rsquo;s attack gain ability stacks :) (this is why it is the only one at 3. Because it is objectively the best)</p><p>Fissure is a wonderful addition to the side. While not the&nbsp;<em>best</em>, It is still very good and can impact the game very favorably/slow it down to the point where you can go unga-boonga and bonk with big ships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things I would change to make more optimal:</p><p>Prosperity is an amazing card that I do not own. If you own it I would recommend swapping anti-spell for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, I would suggest this deck as it is relatively cheap and insanely fun.

Let's be honest the magnet cards by themselves are not really good besides berserkion just being a rock type dark armed dragon, however being rock type in master duel is probably one of the best typings due to them having ""full"" power adamancipators (2 analyzer means nothing lol) and block dragon along with some synergies that allow for combos konami didn't think about. This is Adamancipator Magnet Warrior.</p><p>Main Deck</p><p>This deck is very simple, max copies of each adamancipator because one of them activating will lead to a synchro or full halq don combo. 1 gamma, beta and alpha because these cards suck but they will get us into berserkion. 3 epsilon because this is the best magnet warrior, if you already have a magnet in the grave then it allows you to summon one, this does not count the one it sends so keep that in mind. 3 delta because this can dump a gamma, beta or alpha for berserkion. 1 Berserkion as out boss monster that will combo with swordsoul chengying. 1 Block dragon because it is a very powerful card but the deck is tight on space and I cannot pull it with adamancipators. 3 doki doki, this card is crazy and allows a lot of plays just hope not to draw gamma, alpha or beta with it because they can't go into a tuner. 1 Jet synchron for halq. 1 o-lion for auroradon plays. 1 nemeses corridor because you banish a decent ammount and it can be searched from cupid pitch for a 1 card thunder dragon colossus. 3 maxx C, 3 Ash, 1 Token Collector, ! called by, ! crossout and 1 imperm for out hand traps. 1 foolish to set up grave, mostly to send block dragon but it can set up magnets for berserkion if needed or be used with signs. 3 adamancipator signs allows us to recycle our rock monsters to extend into infinity. 1 pot of averice to extend further, I would run 2 but deck space is already really tight.</p><p>Extra Deck</p><p>1 Thunder Dragon Colossus nemeses corridor get it out and it locks your opponent from adding cards to hand, it also gains 1 time protection which is pretty decent. 1 cupid pitch for halq don plays. 1 naturia beast, really crazy card that can sometimes just prevent the opponenet from playing yu-gi-oh. Adamancipator Risen Raptite, used as an extender and will activate it's quick effect if auroradon or o-lion are in grave. 1 dawn dragster for a negate. 1 TG hyper librairan used for the halq don combo. 1 Borreload savage dragon for a negate and makes use of halq or auroradon after they combo. 1 adamancipator dragite, very good board clear and will gain it's quick effect with halq in grave. 1 baronne for a negate and can be made with a level 2 tuner and block dragon to then use block dragon's effect to extend. 1 Chengying because this card will combo with berserkion allowing you to banish your megnets when he's summoned getting a free banish 2 then if you get to activate his effect to banish a magnet and pop a card you get to activate again to banish 2, this turns berserkion's effect into a non once per turn +2 board and grave nuke, it's not easy to get the 2 out at the same time but it can pretty much shut down any deck due to this being a non-targeting banish. 1 Geomathmech final sigma, a big ass boss monster that is easy to get out with analyzer and block dragon to make a very hard to remove boss monster at the end of a combo line. 1 Gallent Granite to search block dragon and can be tributed by Auroradon to make space for more plays. 1 Halq,1 Auroradon for combo. 1 Borrelsword dragon as a finisher going 2nd. You can play a brakion if you are running into too many trap decks on ladder, I would just swap beast out for it.</p><p>Main Halq Don line</p><p>Your main halq don line will be an adamancipator gets out any non-tuner, go into halq summoning jet synchron, link into auroradon, sac auroradon and a token for o-lion, synch o-lion and a token for hyper librarian, summon jet synchron back, synch jet synchron and a token for cupid pitch leveling up to 5, go into either a dragite or borreload savage dragon picking up auroradon, then search corridor and special summon it targeting the banished jet synchron, then you tribute corridor for thunder dragon colossus. This is just a basic combo and can easily be extended with raptite's effect or having a reasurcher, seeker, signs, foolish, avarice if you go into dragite, or an unused normal summon if you special summoned analyzer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conclision</p><p>While this deck is mostly just adamancipator synchro plays it does use the magnet warriors to its advantage for some really strong board states if you high roll and if you don't you are still playing adamancipators so you should be okay.</p>"

So I adopted this blind second OTK deck - RANK 8 OTK!<br /><br />This deck is extremely simple and one dimensional. The goal of this deck is to smash your opponent's board with your many board breakers, then proceed to OTK with Numeron Dragon.</p><p>There is really no explanation needed for this deck. Everything in this deck are boardbreakers and level 8 special summons to facilitate the Numeron Dragon OTK.<br /><br />The simple combo is 2 rank 8s -&gt; Draglubion -&gt; 9000ATK Numeron Dragon.</p><p>Rank 8 OTK is such a simple and easy way to blow off steam after how stressful and tilting losing the coin toss is. Something as straightforward, simple and easy is a good way to un-tilt myself from the ridiculous unbreakable boards that many players set up in Masterduel, especially in the higher leagues.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the deck guys!</p>"

The goal is to make Chaos Ruler really good.</p><p>So, for P.U.N,K, cards I'm running a pretty dense engine. 3 Ze Amin with 3 Teleport, 2 Deer Note, and one each of Foxy Tune and Ogre Dance. I think having the third Ze Amin makes the card a lot less bricky on the whole, and 2 Deer Note opens up double rank 8 plays that I wanted the deck to include.</p><p>For Tear cards I'm on 4 of the Field Spell, and 3 of each of them except for Reinoheart, + 1 Sulliek. Reinoheart is competing with Ze Amin as a Normal Summon, and it isn't always that great to send, plus we have a bunch of searchers, so I think 2 Reino is perfect. Notably you also can't pick it up with Chaos Ruler.</p><p>After that we're on a lot of hand traps. 3 Gamma with a Driver works wonders with E-Tele. We have Lamda in the mix as well, making this interruption much better. It also protects E-Tele from Ash and the like. It is also good for being a target for Spright Elf, this will turn on Barrone plays, or even Barrone looping Scythe. 1 Ghost Ogre to make E-Tele slightly better. 3 D.D. Crow, run because it is quite good right now in the meta and because you can pick it up with Chaos Ruler. 2 Effect Veiler, I wish there was room for 3 but Scythe is too good not to main. The 1 Scythe isn't really a hand trap, but it is good to search and to mill and helps shut people's turns off. And 3 Cosmic Cyclone - I'm not out to lose to mine, and the card has numerous technical applications in generic matchups that make it the most splashable MST available, even in a world with Harpie's Feather Duster.</p><p>The Extra Deck is very tight, lots of competition for each slot. I'm not sure this is actually the best layout, but it fits all of the most important cards, and has 2 of the real core cards, Chaos Ruler and Kitkalos.</p><p>Side deck is going first cards and going second cards, pretty basic, not much to see here.</p>"

Let me explain a bit more in Detail how these legendary creatures from Japan work:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Help me I'm a Spirit!</strong></p><p>Spirits like Union or Tuner is a undergroup of effect Monsters which is very small to this very day and lacked suppport until recently. Spirit Monsters general rules with a few exceptions are that they cannot be Special Summoned and they return to the Owner's Hand during the End Phase of the turn they are summoned or flipped face up.</p><p>Sounds terrible but imagine a Card which says Discard the opponents whole Hand or Draw until you have 5 Cards in Hand. Spirit effects are strong and can be reused every turn while hiding behind defensive tools they have. That's what makes them strong. So let's look at our different Options we play now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The many different Options</strong></p><p>To gain access to your many options at any time Aratama is the key card to use. Pot of Duality is a must play too, since you almost use no special Summons in this Deck. The big 4: Sword Emperor - Tsumuhakutsunagi, Amaterasu, Hino-Kago-Tsuchi and Yamata Dragon are to be played carefully when the situation allows. Thanks to the new Sakitama they can be more easily summoned turn 1 and combined with Nikitama you get all invested Ressources back too.</p><p>Amano Iwato and Yata Garasu have lockdown capabilitys which makes them nice options too. It's very good to use Izanagi or Konohanasakuya to keep Amano Iwato or the Big 4 on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Spring of Rebirth at 3 looks strange at first sight but let me explain. You can indeed Chainblock the effect of Spirit's Invitation with the Spring of Rebirth since both are Mandatory triggers. Spirit's Invitation's current errata is a bit of a Mystery. The OCG and Master Duel too already got the updated text which forces the opponent to select one of his Monsters to return to his Hand instead of you. This effect ignores almost any kind of protection making it a strong Tower Removal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inbetween the Spirit World</strong></p><p>The many other small Spirit Monsters all have useful applications in various Situations making them interesting to use. The 2 one tribute Removal Spirits Dark Dust Spirit and Fenghuang are perfect to be looped over and over again to gain massive Advantage over the opponent. Same goes for Rasetsu and Yaksha but in a much smaller scale.&nbsp;</p><p>Yamato no Kami is an additional summon every Turn with build in S &amp; T removal. Asura Priest can remove whole Boards of Weak Monsters. Tsukuyomi is Semi Removal and can flip your own Spirits Face Down again, especially nice with Amaterasu combined. Maharaghi can manipulate your Draw every turn to Draw the right cards, Izanami can recycle Spirits every turn and set up the GY and Inaba White Rabbit can slowly poke away the opponents LP while hiding behind cards like Invitation or Spring of Rebirth.&nbsp;</p><p>And let's not forget <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=30426226"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/30426226.jpg"" data-card=""30426226"" data-name=""Switcheroroo"">Switcheroroo</span></a> which can exchange all Monsters on the field when you control the same amount of Monsters. This is Quick effect non targeting Removal and all the Spirits will return to your Hand during the End Phase, while you keep the opponents Monsters permanently. Very Strong and game changing indeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final Words</strong></p><p>Overall this deck can surprise the unprepared opponent and win out of nowhere. Against strong offensive Decks it's difficult to keep up with this slower Control Strategy but it certainly works most of the time if played right.</p><p>The new Level 11 Sword Emperor Spirit Boss Monster alone brings this Deck back into the well deserved Spotlight and it's very capable dealing with difficult Boardstates thanks to many options available at any time. Lastly Sakitama was the last missing piece to bring this Strategy back into serious Deckbuilding Area.</p><p>Give it a try and summon some Spirits from ancient Japan upon your opponent!&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆☆</p>"
