Your opening plays will ideally start with you using Swirl Slime in the hand with Necro Slime to summon D'Arc, getting at least one other monster on the field (usually by normal summoning a Kepler for a search or a Lamia so you potentially get two uses out of her ideally), using Necro Slime in the gy to bring out Genghis, then linking away D'Arc and your other monster that isn't Genghis to bring out Gilgamesh, set your scales and use Genghis' effect to bring back your D'Arc. After this opening the deck can go in a few directions depending on what you have left in your hand or gy. Brining out Siegfried should be a priority since it's an easy spell/trap negate without an extra cost. Ghost is best used to send back your banished Necro Slimes to the gy by using it for Necro Slime's fusion, he's also a tuner."

The problem, however, is the downside inherent in the Adventure engine:  during the turn you resolve Rite of Aramiser, you can't activate the effects of normal summoned monsters.  This is a big problem, considering so many of the classic Inzektor routes revolve around that first normal summon, not to mention the extra normal summon you get from Beetrooper Armor Horn.  Because of this I thought it was a bit disappointing that such anti-synergy exists, considering how much the deck would love to run the engine.  But then I thought maybe they still can.  Yes, there are some hands where you cannot use the brave engine and thus it's more or less dead.  But thanks to Zektrike, there are a lot of 3 or 4 card hands that could allow you to resolve the engine and play through your turn without relying on your Dragonfly or Centepede to be normal summoned, at least not to get effects from doing so.  Additionally, there are many hands where you draw the soft garnets to act as situational extenders.  Heck, there's no penalty for activating Enchantress, so even if your hand can't resolve the brave engine, perhaps just activating Enchantress is enough to make an antsy player burn their Ash.   The brave engine also makes it so even if your hand is utter crap, with no real way to get the Inzektor flow going, just opening Rite or Enchantress is enough to let you end on <em>something</em>.  I'm no expert in Inzektors or how well this would work out in practice, but I think it's at least worth testing out.  It's certainly a lot more interesting of a concept than simply replacing the 7 Adventure engine cards with 2 Crossout Designator + 1 of stuff I want to hate on, at least, and I think it should be less bricky too.  What are your thoughts on the concept and the deck ratios?"

I'd like the other deck to be more control heavy than this one (which has some pretty punchy combos).

It wasn't made with competitive play fully in mind so it will most likely struggle against the top meta decks. It was also done in Master Duel specifically so keep it in mind regarding some cards like Maxx C, you might want to change them depending on how and where you're using this.  That being said, some cards were added in the extra deck to make it more survivable like Isolde, Sunrise and Absolute Zero. One of the best combos is to summon Absolute Zero (preferably with Liquid Soldier as one of its materials to activate its effect too) and then Mask Change it to Masked HERO Acid. This will trigger Absolute Zero's Raigeki effect and Acid's Harpie's Feather Duster effect, wiping the opponent's field (provided you're able to do it without negation, of course).  • Don't be afraid to send Shadow Mist to the graveyard, but do be careful when you activate her effect in there. Do not special summon her from the GY on the same turn because you can only activate one effect per turn.  • If you ever use Liquid Soldier's effect to draw 2 cards and have to discard one, and you end up with both a ""Change"" card and ""Mask Charge"", discard the ""Change"" card, you'll be able to recover it immediately with Mask Charge (provided you also have a HERO in the GY).  • Contrast HERO Chaos is the ace of the Masked Heroes and you'll want it as soon as possible.  Any comments for improvements to it are welcome, but keep in mind the theme of the deck is to have every Masked HERO in it in tribute to Kamen Rider."

Ideally on turn 1 you want to bring out Bahamut Shark to detach a material and then summon Toadally Awesome. Having Defender of the Ice Barrier with another Ice Barrier monster on field is also great since it stops your opponent from declaring an attack (as long as their monsters have attack greater than 1600). On turn 2 you will want to summon out either Trishula Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier or regular Trishula to remove cards with its' non-targeting banishing effect. Usually, if my opponent has 3 or more cards I will try to summon Zero Dragon, and if they have only one card on the field I will summon out regular Trishula so I can also banish cards from their hand and graveyard too.  If you manage to draw Gozen Match on turn one then this is a great time to summon Number 4: Stealth Kragen from the Extra deck as it changes all monsters to the water Attribute. If your opponent does not play any water monsters this is especially effective, as they will simply be locked into the one monster that you have changed into water with Steatlh Kragen plus the effect of Gozen Match.  *I used a modified version of this deck to climb to Platinum in Master Duel. Since Toadally Awesome is limited to one on Master Duel I substitute the second Toad with Number 47: Nightmare Shark. I also cut 1 Prior of the Ice Barrier, Salvage and Upstart Goblin for 3 Maxx ""C"" since the extra draw power is absolutely incredible in this deck. If you can find other cards that consistently give you draw power I heavily recommend that you use them in this deck as they help it greatly, both in real life and in Master Duel."

Raigeki, lightning storm: Most monsters have floating effect or proections nowdays, these cards might sometimes brick you.  Pot of Avarice: This card sometimes brick, you cannot use it turn one.  Ghost belle, Droll &amp; lock bird, Ghost ogre, Gamma: Not generic enough, sometimes brick.  Call by the grave &amp; Shark Cannon &amp; Crossout Designator: Not all decks use monsters in graveyard, sometimes brick.  Upstar goblin: Chicken's game is better, sky strikers have a hard time OTKing opponent with more than 8K LP,  Accesscode &amp; 2 sky striker monsters can only output 8K damage.  Kaiser Colussum &amp; There can only be one: Mostly useless if not going first.  Foolish Brial Goods &amp; Metalfoe Fusion &amp; Toon table of content: Bricks more than it helps.

Harpie feather duster, other S&amp;T removal: If Eldlich didn't open skill drain and imperial order, these are not really needed.  &nbsp;  Reasons for playing some of the cards:  2 Nibiru: Not 3 by reducing chances of bricking, but high enough for opening &amp; maxx c into it.  2 Veiler: Not 3 because it might brick, need at least 2 for accesscode play.  Borrelsword: To beat off some ""unaffected by card effects"" boss monsters.  2 Pot of desires: Not 3 because, A, you don't want desires into desires, B, you can't really use 2 since you only have 40 cards in your deck.  Eagle Booster: Good for preventing OTKed by opponent, use it on accesscode and win next turn.  Imperial iron wall: Hurt most decks and help yourself.  Drytron: cannot use eva to +2. Tri-brigade: no banishing to summon &amp; link-4 removal. Gren-maju: dead. VW: shenshen effect useless. Eldlich: cannot go +1 off of traps in grave. Cyber dragon: cannot fusion summon. Invoked Shadoll: invoked summon play got hindered.  Generic: Stops accesscode, callby the grave and crossout designator, DD crow, Most Pots.

Many of the games have a grind game of more than 5 turns so much more important than trying to OTK at all costs with this deck is to exchange resources efficiently which is very easy to do thanks to the absurd cards called <a data-name=""Mathmech Superfactorial"">Mathmech Superfactorial</a> and <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> that are a potential -3 to even -4 for the opponent counting the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> omni negate. Not to mention that archetype XYZ monsters are excellent and even a little stolen when reading for the first time, <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> being a Searcher and Extender and <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> a <a data-name=""Trishula"">Trishula</a> that can be given on the opponent's turn. An interesting point about Mathmech's Extra Deck monsters is that they are generic and can be used in almost any deck. I myself am sure that someday there will be a deck to abuse Alembertian absurd effects when made with 3 materials or 4 materials.  /////////////////////////////////////////                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <strong>Decklist picks:</strong> The Mathmech archetype cards such as Synchro level 8, Equip's spell and Reborn's spell and Trap which is a pop don't do much for the deck and therefore are not part of the decklist. Generic Cyberse support like <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a> and <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> are cards that take up consistency card slots and hand traps so in the end they don't do much for deck strategy. Cynet Mining <strong>doesn't have good discards</strong> in the deck and you don't need these cards to play Mathmech after all. ///////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Recommended cards:</strong> Mathmech's deck in the TCG enters this February format with a lot more consistency issues because of the <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> limitation and one card that can help the deck is <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a> which is a very versatile card. Another card that I highly recommend using in the deck is <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a> because it's very easy to trigger its effect and clear the opponent's field by going second.  /////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combos: </strong>  This topic is not really a tutorial on how to play each specific hand, but plays I made with a random hand that I opened playing with the deck. It's a nice way to show the deck's proposal from where it wants to go, considering how you would start your moves and the play lines chosen. The important thing is to understand that this is a deck that does not tolerate errors during gameplay, so you should always be aware of the most efficient way to play. These examples that I show you along with the technoplay tips that I talk about after these combos are enough to get you started playing Mathmech.  As you can see these combos are narrations of how I played with a certain hand and how I behaved <strong>after taking interactions</strong> like hand traps and from the opponent's established fields as well. From the End Board you can see that the objective is to pass with the <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> trap along with <strong>3 Mathmech Monsters in the GY</strong> with different names including the <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> which turns the Xyz Mathmech into an <strong>omni negate</strong> as well. For this we use the <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> combo to access Link-2 <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> that adds the Diameter/Nabla needed to make the <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> that adds the Trap Superfactorial at the same time that it finishes the necessary names in the gy.

You always use the Balancer Lord effect from Extra Normal Summon and save to use only the normal summons of good cards that are the basics of the deck save the Normal Summons for the right cards.  <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> allows your Mathmech boss monsters to be omni negate to interact with the opponent or negate cards like Nibiru on your turn. Whenever you open it with Diameter you want to throw a monster in the gy to take advantage of its Normal Summon. So much so that even if you draw from Balancer Lord + Diameter, you doing this play do very well. However you have to analyze if your hand is too weak for interactions because in that case a negate in the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> makes your turn end. You have to remember that <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> is guaranteed to search for negate so it is always safe to go straight to it with Diameter.  <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> is a fundamental piece to access the missing monster to make the Superfactorial alive in the opponent's turn, especially the Diameter but it can be <a data-name=""Sigma"">Sigma</a> if you already have access to the Diameter. If you open from Nabla and Diameter but you can't have a monster in the GY, the best thing is to use Nabla from NS and use eff SS Diameter from Deck and keep the Diameter in hand as Follow Up.  If you can use <a data-name=""Multiplication"">Multiplication</a>/Nabla as Xyz material on your next turn if you Tribute Xyz with the effect of Nabla or Alembertian it trigger eff to double ATK/Monster can make two attacks which is cool if the monster you make is <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> for example.  Important to know the right choices of how to start hand summons, see the details to have plays after interactions mainly going second.  When you open with RANK-4 Alembertian play and Extender you can start adding a <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and then go to play Link Disciple and Devotee and Wicckid combo. But this is not an orthodox play and it might be good to first go to Wicckid turbo play to gain access to Diameter to ensure Alembertian will resolve and add Superfactorial. Primary Follow Up is adding Diameter and secondary is adding Nabla/Sigma.  Cool is that if you already open with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>, use Alembertian to add Extenders or Nabla to access Diameter and try to generate an advantage with Link Disciple and Link Devotee moves etc. If you can stop the opponent without having to use the Superfactorial, it's very good to leave it to use it <strong>only on your turn</strong> because in addition to the mini Trishula you get right at the beginning of the Diameter's negate turn to play safe your turn. You only activate on his turn with him doing nothing that threatens you if he sets a trap on the same column as the Superfactorial because it will most likely be an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>. Many times you want to play Accesscode Turbo and even then you don't have a chance to OTK it and so using two Superfactorial and two <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> is essential. It's important to understand that this is not an OTK deck so using the second trap in matches plus grind game is fundamental, looking at the gamestate and predicting the best move is essential in decks that are based on trading resources and for everything I've played with this deck you <strong>always take the game to a simplified gamestate</strong>.  Always try to play around <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> when you have <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> on the field because first you must use I:P Masquerena eff and if he negates with Droplets you will still have the Superfactorial summon Laplacian. If you take <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> in the Superfactorial eff on one of the 3 targets in the gy you will still be able to summon the other two targets and do the <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> at least to add a Follow Up and if you have the Diameter as material have an omni negate also. Only if the opponent banishes at least 2 targets from the Superfactorial that it doesn't resolve.  <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> does not trigger eff if <strong>MASTER DUEL</strong> game <strong>button is Off</strong>. If you are facing a deck that uses <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, summon Parallel eXceed in Attack Position because if your opponent uses Skill Drain the eXceed returns to 2k atk and at least you will have a monster with great attack to try to survive until you take the Skill Drain that can be done with even <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> using effect and banishing itself from the field as cost.  Of the Deck Extenders: <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a>, <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> and <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> you should pay attention to the card details that first all of them <strong>lock you from Special Summoning Cyberse</strong> monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. Second that Sigma is the best extender of the 3 because it is searchable by Wicckid since it is Tuner and being able to come back from GY has the detail of being <strong>banned when leaving the field</strong> so the only way to not have it banned is to use it as xyz material but it doesn't make much difference to have him banned for his turn 1 combo to pass. Addition and Subtraction <strong>cannot declare an attack</strong> in the turn that are Special Summoned by their own effect and they can <strong>target opponent's monsters</strong> whatever better the deck to go second and break the field.  <strong>Against Decks Blind Second</strong> = This deck doesn't care about many of the cards used to break the field. For example <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> on monster doesn't affect the deck at all because of Wicckid and Laplacian and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> at best takes the interaction from I:P Masquerena only. <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> is another card that the deck handles easily. The best blind second card against Mathmech is the <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Technoplay cards of Extra Deck:</strong> <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> <strong>doesn't destroy the cards but sends them to the GY</strong> so you can take spells/traps out of the field on the protection of <a data-name=""Heavenly Sky"">Heavenly Sky</a> or the <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> that came back from the GY by its own effect.  <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> on the Following turn is usually to add extenders to kill the opponent whether Sigma or Nabla bring Multiplication from the deck and do FINAL SIGMA or Accesscode Talker Turbo or continue controlling the game with Superfactorial.  *(Don't FORGET that <a data-name=""LINK DEVOTEE"">LINK DEVOTEE</a> has a MANDATORY Eff to ACTIVATE when he ENTERS the FIELD to LOCK you into CANNOT SUMMON LINK-3 or Higher) ***Place the <strong>tokens</strong> in the zones away from the Links arrows.  <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> protects Wicckid from being negated by Trap cards like Infinite Impermanence. Against backrow matchups they are insane too.  LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> is an absurd card that is a fundamental piece for the deck to spin and you access the cards you need to make your turn 1 setup and even generate follow up on your opponent's turn by activating <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and bringing 1 of the Mathmech from gy in the zone it points to (it doesn't have to be the XYZ in Wicckid's zone to trigger its effect).  COOL INTERACTION: WICCKID + SUPERFACTORIAL = You don't need to bring XYZ to the field in the Wicckid zone, but the Reborn of the GY is one in the Wicckid zone and even then you in the new chain link can use Wicckid cl1 Laplacian cl2. As long as Wicckid is on the field you can generate plus and add Mathmech Tuners to the hand every turn. Wicckid <strong>protecting the Cyberse he points out from Destruction</strong> is also absurd. See what is really <strong>going to banish from gy as cost of Wicckid</strong> because you don't want to banish Mathmech level 4 monsters and if possible you want to also keep the Links in gy so that your Accesscode has multiple pops so if you have XYZ Alembertian and Laplacian at GY banning them is always free. A very interesting play is to use Wicckid's absurd effect in your favor when you open it going second to force interactions because if you do <strong>Wicckid with eXceed</strong> in your hand, you practically get to Accesscode without losing to cards that destroy, that is, guaranteed to force interactions .  It happens a lot to use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> to <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> on the opponent's turn in trap matches already to start your turn by destroying the opponent's backrow with an Accesscode of 4300atk that cannot be destroyed by effects. When opponent uses Dogmatika Maximus effect you always send I:P Masquerena + Unicorn to GY. (remember to keep a card in hand for Knightmare Unicorn - a very simple detail to remember for I:P Masquerena to work)  One cool thing about this deck is the ability to <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> with a lot of extra effects like Attack twice or Doubled ATK which is really good."

It excels at playing through your opponent's disruption through the use of chain blocking. Your main starters are Black Metal Dragon, Starliege Seyfert, and Chaos Space. These cards can give you access to additional monsters while chain blocking your most important effects. For instance, if you have Black Metal Dragon and a Rokket monster in hand, you can use Black Metal Dragon to link summon Striker Dragon. Then, since both monsters' effects activate at the same time, you can decide what order they will occur in the chain. Your opponent will only be able to respond to the last card activated in the chain. By making Striker Dragon chain link 1 and Black Metal Dragon chain link 2, your opponent cannot use a card like Ash Blossom to negate your Striker Dragon's effect. Therefore, you can successfully add Boot Sector Launch and use it to summon the Rokket monster from hand. To play through interruption optimally, you will have to decide which effects to chain block based on what cards you have in hand and what situation you are in.

From Here You Can Use Tracer's Effect To Destroy Saryuja And Special Summon A Recharger Or Silverrokket From Deck &gt; Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon And Equip Saryuja  These combos outlined should give you a basic idea of how the deck is played. Throughout your turn, you will ideally gain access to even more plays through the cards you draw and excavate. As you get more familiar with the deck, you will see many other combo lines that you can go through. The usual end board is spheres + hot red dragon archfiend abyss, spheres + borreload savage dragon, or sometimes all 3. Spheres functions as both disruption and a way to search levianeer by summoning brotaur off its second effect. By this point you will have already filled your graveyard with the necessary requirements to summon it when your opponent passes turn. It can then be used to help break the board they set up if they managed to play through your disruption.  Some things to keep in mind:  <em>*Rokket Tracer's effect will lock you into summoning dark monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.</em>  <em>*Rokket Synchron's effect will lock you into summoning dark monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.</em>  <em>*Black Metal Dragon is not once per turn.</em>  <em>*Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres can only activate its effect to return a card to hand while in an extra monster zone.</em>  <em>*When tributing itself for cost, Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres can resolve its effect to return a card to hand while under skill drain, because it won't be on the field during resolution.</em>  <em>*Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres does not target. You will choose which face-up card to return to hand when resolving its effect.</em>  <em>*Nibiru will trigger Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres effect to special summon a dragon from deck.</em>  <em>*Rokket Tracer's effect is a quick effect, so you can chain it to the activation of one of your spell cards, and destroy that spell card, to get both effects without having to sacrifice an additional resource.</em>  <em>*White Dragon Wyverburster and Black Dragon Collapserpent's effect to special summon themselves from hand is once per turn, but their effect to add each other is not.</em>"

Well look no further because Generaider is here (and has been for a while but let's not talk about that). This deck is one of those classic field spell centric decks that has zero way to play when the field spell is somewhere other than on board. But unlike those decks, you're running a huge amount of level 9s that really want to stay in deck for the deck to function. However, Generaiders have some extremely good support to make up for this inherent weak spot that makes them semi-consistent and an absolute king of the mid-game.  There are 9 main deck monsters in the archetype and really only 6 are worth talking about. Harr, Hela, Utgarda, and Nidhogg all have the usual Generaider effects where they tribute monsters for a beneficial effect. Harr is an omni-negate, Hela is a reborn, Utgarda is a targeting banish, and Nidhogg is a summon negate. Mardel and Loptr are a bit unique in the deck as Mardel is your search card when summoned and Loptr tributes any Generaider on board (including itself) for a level 9 Generaider from deck. Loptr is also the only normal summon in the deck, so all you Aleister fanboys can go wild. Naglfar, Frodi, and Dovelgus are all really really bleh compared to the rest, so don't run them unless you feel super confident in your ability to draw like Lithium when he plays Monarchs.  As for ratios of the main deck Generaiders, 3 Mardel and 3 Loptr is standard with one or two of the others depending on what you think you'll need in the deck. Trias Hierarchia is also a really good inclusion in the deck as it can tribute your Generaider tokens to summon itself on your opponent's turn. If you include that, run 2 or 3 copies as it is always online if you have access to the field spell.  Onto the spell cards, Boss Stage is the heart and soul of the deck. It kinda defines the whole playstyle of Generaiders, that being playing during your opponent's turn but in a cooler way than PSY-Frames could ever hope to achieve. It summons tokens during their turn that enable every Generaider to pop off, and it summons one from deck before doing so. Just the coolest field spell in the game in my opinion. Run three because you have to.  To find the field spell we have 7 additional backrow (plus Mardel) to find it. Terraforming is Terraforming and it just does Terraforming things. I'd run three if I could, but you kinda can't and probably never will be able to again. RIP in kill sweet prince. Boss Quest searches two Generaider spells and traps with different names for the low, low cost of putting a brick back in the deck. You run three and only ever three. Boss Fight activates Boss Stage from the deck or GY. It's like Metaverse but better. Run three. Boss Room is a really cool card that changes any activated effect into both players drawing one card. I usually run three, but with Boss Quest it's almost always accessible so you can run one or two instead.  The non-Generaider backrow is pretty self-explanatory. Pot of Avarice keeps you in the game longer than 11 turns which might not ever come up if the people you play against are always on combo decks, but I always end up playing against Dark Magician or Geist 90% of the time so it's nice to have this card in the deck. Kuji-Kiri Curse is an additional unbricking tool that also sets up Hela while drawing two cards. You can run Prosperity instead, but you do want your extra deck to help close out games. World Legacy's Monstrosity is an amazing card in the deck as it can either summon one level 9 from your hand or summon two from deck if you have one on board already. Other than just simply waiting for Boss Stage to activate a few times, this is how you get into the extra deck. Rank-Up Magic Argent Chaos Force is a bit of a sussy include, but I lost a game to geist while being 100 LP from winning, so this enables you to summon this deck's version of ""Cowboy for game"" being Number C9.  The extra deck is just every single good rank 9 you can run with some links to help with using Loptr as material when your deck is running low on cards. Heart-eartH is my favorite xyz monster in the game, and could absolutely be replaced by something better, but it's included here because I really like the card. Tachyon Dragon helps close out games with its skill drain effect. Enterblathnir is just really good answer to a lot of problem cards with its non-targeting banish. Dyson Sphere is good at cleaning up games by attacking directly (and then you can rank it up to really close out a game). Hyperyton brings even more negates to the party in the weirdest way possible. The Cat is another Hela but without the tribute cost. Jormungandr is technically the boss monster of the deck and can steal your opponent's resources to achieve big number.  The Knightmares are standard and don't need explaining. World Gears, however, is probably the worst deckbuilding choice I have ever made. If you summon this card, it clears the board, which sounds super cool. But Generaiders kinda want the board so they can build up advantage turn by turn and exhaust their opponent. Not to mention if you manage to get 3 level 9's on board, you can access the entire extra deck (except the chaos xyz cards) instead of a field nuke towers. It might be better than I make it out to be, but I've never had it work for me.  In the side deck, Lava Golem is a solid choice with how few normal summons the deck has. Kaijus might be better in most cases, but Enterblathnir can usually handle a single boss monster on its own. Raigeki is Raigeki and it's just better lightning storm now that it's unbanned. Cosmic Cyclone is a good answer to other spell reliant decks and Heavy Storm Duster does the same but while dodging Anti-Spell and Imperial Order (Not anymore though, get fucked IO). Imperm is just my favorite handtrap with how effective it is going first or second, but you can use any other hand traps you'd like.  This definitely isn't the best build of the deck out there, but I'm not a huge fan of mixing archetypes together so this is the best I can make while keeping it pure. You can add Girsu, Therizia, or Aleister and their engine cards to give the deck more normal summons and either extension or boss monsters, or use a Guru deck as the base and splash in Generaider if you're a streamer who's beyond high on copium. If you have any questions or suggestions, leave them below so I can try and improve the deck as best as I can."

The P.U.N.K.'s are capable of going into things like Aurorodon lines and Baronne de Fleur, but I can't really afford that to a deck i'm taking to locals maybe once a month. That being said, they've got some fun synergies and I personally feel like VW can do more interesting things with the 2 slots missing from Desires and fill them with Small World lines. Amazing Dragon just cares about Psychics in Grave for it's bounce effect, not specifically P.U.N.K.'s.  First thing i would cut is the Sharakusai/Rising Carp for Halq setup."
