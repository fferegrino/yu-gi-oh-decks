Dark Warrior Guardragon Turbo (Going First),"Alright so I've had this deck for a little while now, and was debating on whether I should post it or not because I made this build extremely private because it's just so broken. I figured I'd post it for you guys to enjoy and play. This deck is insane going first. It has so many starters and can play through multiple handtraps depending on your hand. This deck almost never bricks, I'd say 90% of the time it doesn't brick. The end goal of your first turn is to end on 2-3 negates plus 2 interruptions and rip a card out of your opponent's hand. There are multiple routes you can go starting off as there are multiple combos that lead you to the same result, which is one of the reasons this deck can play through multiple handtraps, if one route gets cut off because of a handtrap you can go another route that will lead to the same end board. The 3 routes are the warrior route, which involves bringing out Isolde using 2 warrior monsters, there is the Ib Synchro route, which involves summoning <a data-name=""draconnet"">Draconnet</a> and using its effect to summon Galaxy Serpent to make the Ib Synchro, and lastly, there is the Dragon combo which just involves you using monsters to bring out PSY-Framlord Lamba and summon dragons to go into the guardragon plays. If you go down the warrior path you need to use Isolde's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> and use his effect to dump Destrudo into the grave to summon Destrudo and go into Elpy and then Triple Burst and going into full combo. If you were to go down the Ib Synchro route, you would use Serpent and Draconnet or any other level 3 monster to go into Ib and use her effect to get <a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a> from your deck to hand, then you can use the spell to summon back Serpent and go into Lambda which you can then use Ib's other effect to summon World Chalice Guardragon and go into Elpy and then Pisty and do full Guardragon combo. A lot of the time during the guardragon combo I find myself having an extra monster to go into Saryuja Skull Dread to be able to rebuild your hand and determine how you want your end board to be, but if you don't have that extra monster just summon the Chaos Dragon Levianeer and use Agarpain, Elpy, Pisty, and Levianeer to make Saryuja. You should end on Number 38 and/or F.A. Dawn Dragster and/or Masked Hero Dark Law, Hot Red Archfiend Abyss, and Heavenly Seal. Aether is really nice too because once you tribute Heavenly Seal and use its effect to special summon a dragon from your deck, you can summon Aether and banish a monster your opponent controls. I hope you guys enjoy this deck and stick around for more!"

Some strategies that I discovered may be new to you while others you may already know. It is my first crack at a pendulum deck and I like to do things my way. This deck also uses cards that are uncommon to the pendulum decks. <ol>  	<li>Aim to pendulum summon Breaker, the Dark Magical Warrior. It will have three counters, which will give it a 1200 atk boost. Also, you will be able to destroy the back row three times.</li>  	<li>Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon s a great attack negate along with the added effect of special summoning an Odd-Eyes monster from the hand or graveyard. Its graveyard effect allows you to special summon an Odd-Eyes monster from the extra deck, which is a big deal.</li>  	<li>Star Pendulumgraph and Time Pendulumgraph works in tandem. Time pendulumgraph destroys a pendulum magician monster to destroy a card on the field. Star Pendulumgraph activates when a pendulum magician card is destroyed to add another pendulum magician to your hand. So, you can Time a PM, destroy one of your opponent's card, then Star activates, adding a PM to your hand.</li>  	<li>Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon is extremely important for this deck. In the Pendulum Zone, its effect makes you gain an Odd-Eyes monster from the hand, deck or graveyard when one has been destroyed. The deck as a lot of monsters with scale 4 and lower. When placing any of these cards in the pendulum zone, activate Duelist Alliance, add Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon to the hand, then place it in the other pendulum zone.</li>  	<li>Acrobatic Magician is only here for its ability to special summon for the hand or the pendulum zone. From the pendulum zone, it can be special summon when my opponent destroys a monster by effect. From the hand, if a spell card has been negated, it can be special summoned.</li>  	<li>Odd-Eyes Dragon inflict damage to half the monster attack that it destroyed. Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon does double battle damage. Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon destroys one of your opponents monster upon summoning and inflicts damage equal to that monster's attack. Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon inflicts 1200 or 2400 damage when it does battle damage and there are 1 or 2 Odd-eyes cards in the pendulum zone. Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend destroys all special summoned effect monsters and inflicts 500 damage for each. Enlightenment Paladin inflicts damage when it destroys a monster, equal tot he attack of that monster. Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing destroys the opponents monster and inflict damage equal to its attack. Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon inflicts 1000 damage for each of the opponent's monsters it destroys by its effect. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon inflicts 500 damage every time the opponent activates a card.</li>  	<li>Wee Witch's Apprentice assists this deck for most of the monsters are the dark attribute. It is not necessary to use 2 of them, but its usefulness in returning dark cards form the graveyard to the hand makes it useful.</li>  	<li>Xiangke and Xiangsheng Magician helps in the extension of Xyz summoning when they are in the pendulum zone.</li>  	<li>Until they bring more link monster support for pendulum decks, the use of Heavymetlfoes Electrumite and Zefra Metaltron is justified.</li>  	<li>Aim to get All-Eyes Phantom Dragon and Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon in the pendulum zones. All-Eyes effect to make dragon pendulum monsters have a second attack when they destroy a monster is a great effect and Arc Pendulum replaces Odd-Eyes monsters when they are destroyed.</li> </ol> There are many more strategies to run in this deck. Persons may mot agree with my build or strategies. To each his own."

I was amazed how it walked over more powerful decks. ,"<ol>  	<li>Base Gardna is needed in the graveyard for the attack increase of Acute Cerberus.</li>  	<li>Trinity effects allows you to get Base Gardna to the field. Also protects other tindangle monsters from being destroyed by battle. using Trinity for the link summon also allows u to search out Gergonne's End, which inflicts damage to your opponent equal to the attack of Acute Cerberus. Gergonne's End also protects Acute Cerberus from being destroyed by battle or card effects.</li>  	<li>The addition of Krawler Spine and Prediction Princess Coinorma are an asset to the deck. Spine destroys one of your opponents monsters and Coinorma special summons a flip monster from the deck face down.</li>  	<li>Using Coinorma while Nagel's Protecton is on the field, u can special summon Hound face down. When Hound is flipped, it gains attack equal to the original attack of a chosen monster and flips that monster face-down. Using it on your own monster recycles its effect. Using it on your opponent can slow your opponent strategy when used correctly.</li>  	<li>Monster wipes are now possible with cards that destroy monsters from both sides. Nagel's Protection will protect all your monsters from being destroyed.</li> </ol> This deck is compact and awesome. It's fun and can give stronger meta decks a run. I am still tweaking this deck to add in cards that can help with its consistency."

Here the monster engine is quite reduced, we play 3 Dark Magician to maximise the chances of drawing it and have more possibilities to face the opponent's turn and 3 Magician's Rod to have an excellent tuto option tha can recycle by itself. Magician Of Dark Illusion isn't played everywhere but I put it in 1 to have a fourth monster that can trigger Dark Magical Circle's second effect and have a synergy to recycle Magician's Rod freely. Apprentice Illusion Magician is a good tuto and a Honest-like effect to bypass beatsticks or survive some battlephases, but 2 are sufficient because more could be bricky. Keeper Of Dragon Magic is a meta oriented card in this deck and will be played here to summon Dark Magician The Dragon Knight if needed in a metagame where backrow removals are common. Lastly we play 3 Effect Veiler and Ash Blossom to countain more easily the opponent's board and soften the going second's match ups.  We have a common package of Dark Magician spells and traps to set our strategy. Dark Magician Circle is a pseudo searcher and can make you gain 1 turn replacing a needed card on the top of the deck, it's the main way to suppress opponent's key cards by regularly banishing 1 card of the field. Eternal Soul protects Dark Magician and can consists on a consistant way of triggering Circle's effect each turn, Magician Navigation can summon Dark Magician too and bring out Magician Of Dark Illusion to place the combo with Magician's Rod and can negate spell/trap effets like Called By The Grave to ensure OTKs or set up's viability. Illusion Magic is a searcher of Dark Magician and is usefull when chaining Magician's Rod effect to create a misstiming and avoid Ash Blossom's disruptive plays.  To gain stability and options we play 3 Pot Of Extravagance since the extra deck is almost optionnal and 2 Pot Of Duality to filter the deck and potentially touch 1 more backrow card/debrick a hand. The gameplay of the deck makes it able to easily get rid of Pot Of Duality's restriction.  Finally we play some backrow cards to support the Dark Magician spell/traps package and lock the opponent's turn. Crackdown steal a monster to disrupt boards and can be usefull for a defensive optic if stealing a beatstick. Solemn Judgment can negate almost anything and is even usefull to protect some plays during our second turn. Skill Drain is an amazing card here when our board is ready, since the negation of monster's effects is sufficient to shut down a lot of gameplans and can completely stop decks with the help of Dark Magician circle, it can be protected by Magician Navigation's second effect and Solemn Judgment. Lastly Super Polymerization can consume the monster ressources of a lot of deck and summon a monster to help the protection of your field or pressure the opponent's board with a Raigeki-like death effect  The extra deck contains a lot of x2 monsters to avoid having needed extra deck monsters banished by Pot Of Extravagance's effect. Dark Magician The Dragon Knight is an important card against decks that hits the backrow hard to protect Eternal Soul. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and Mudragon Of The Swamp are Super Polymerization's targets designed to slow down or stop boards of specific aggro match ups. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon can be summoned in main phase 2 to pressure the opponent by rapidly burning it's life points, and Ebon Illusion Magician is a specific way to trigger the Circle while permitting to banish more cards of the field during battle phases. Link spider can be summoned on a Dark Magician to help the summon of the others link monsters and is usefull when our hand is bad because by sending a Dark Magician to the graveyard we can trigger Eternal Soul during the opponent's turn. The knightmares can destroy 1 monster or backrow card to break through the board more easily and the topologic is an alternative way to finish the opponent and can suppress all his backrow in desperate cases.  &nbsp;  The side is quite generic for a control oriented deck, we have more options for playing second and other disruptive cards for specific match ups.  The artifact package lock extra deck hardly dependant decks with Artifact Scythe and is a good way to handle the new Orcust decks and some Guardragon decks loops.  Struggling Battle and The Winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere mode are great board removals for specific match ups when going second, the last one being a Deadly weapon against Guardragon decks and builds that sets a consistant board.  Dinowrestler Pankratops pressure opponent's plays by adding disruption and accelerate the summons of xyz 7 monsters for more solid OTKs/finishers."

The deck puts a twist on the tribute summoning mechanic by allowing the use of continuous spells and traps as fodder. This enables the deck to utilize floodgates and then tribute them off when no longer needed. The Draco monsters themselves add to the advantage cycle by generating +1s whenever the opponent breathes in their general direction. This particular build is extradeck-less to utilize The Monarchs Erupt. As this deck is stun by nature, it can also make use of stun-based monsters like Inspector Boarder and Amano Iwato.  <em>Notes: </em> <em>This is without a side deck for the time being, as I am still figuring out what to side for my local metagame/regional area. Any side deck suggestions greatly appreciated!</em>"

Omg mind blown!!!!,"I´d like to start this deck profile with a small story of mine. So I´m a huuuuuge ritual monster fanatic, so of course, when the new ritual archetype, called ,,Vendread"", got announced, I was veeery excited. About a week later, I bought myself a Vendread deck based on another deck profile on this website. It was a very standard zombie deck, that means Shiranui solitaire,  Mezuki, Uni-Zombie, you know, the basic zombie cards. So I got it and I played it a few days until I noticed that it wasn't really.....consistent. So I just kind of buried it in my shelf ..... Until..... About two days ago when I decided to make Vendread playable again, because come one, its freaking resident evil in Yugioh, That's so awesome! And, as probably many of you know, one of THE BEST ritual support cards to this day got a sweet sweet reprint in one of the newer sets. You all know that I´m talking about herald of arc light, don't you? Well, this card kicks soo much consistency in any ritual based archetype, so it would be dumb not to play it. If you didn't got bored of this text until this point ( which I highly appreciate, you reading FOOL HAHA..JK) then let me tell you about some of the cards in this deck and why I play them. So to address some of the most controversial aspects of this deck and how you likely react when you see them lets start with: 1. Why the heck do you play Nekroz monster???? Well, let me explain my geeks and peeps ( Haha youtube reference ). Back in the day, the most popular and most played ritual support engines was the Nekroz engine. Basically, you ritual summoned Nekroz of unicorn using Nekroz Kaleidoscope and send herald of arc light from your extra deck to the graveyard. Doing so you get a 2300 Atk beatstick that negates the effects of extra deck monster and you get a free search via the effect of herald of arc light. And all of this without using your normal summon.  2. OMG Y U DONT USE IMCANTATION??? TRASH DECK Well this is more a personal problem with this archetype than an actual matter of consistency. It seems like I'm the only one with this opinion (Since every freaking ritual deck mainly consists of the trash cards), but I think with the release these cards, ritual deck became veeeeeery boring. No ritual deck is really unique anymore. Which is why you will never see a ritual deck that I build, that plays Impcantation card. Even if it adds consistency, I do not like 'em !!!! ( Feel free to add them though if you want, you do you and I do me)  3. WAAAAT? A zombie deck without zombie world?? yea I know that zombie world is one of the best zombie support card ( well the cards that work with it are very good), but I didn't really see how it would benefit the deck, sure Balerdroch is a very good card but....naah  4. Why don't you play (insert card name here) in this deck. Well, it already is a 45 card deck and I wouldn't want to kick out any of the cards that I play rn, so no! No ( Insert card name here )!     Again, thanks for supporting my deck builder spirits by clicking on this profile, feel free to leave a like if you like the deck and I hope you will read my next profile,  PEACE!!&#x270c;&#x270c;"

Rather than Atum from way back when, the main combos of the deck focus on Dragunity Knight - Barcha and Romulus to generate link fodder from the two level 2 tuners Couse and Phalanx. Utilizing these cards, the deck explodes using the Guardragon link monsters Pisty, Elpy and Agarpain. Just like Dragon link variants and the ""old"" tempest dragunity deck, strings of combos lead to boards with numerous negates with high stats.  <em>Note: I used to play tempest dragunity when atum and vajrayana were the main ways of playing the deck and comboing, but now that the new support is out I'd like to try my hand at making the deck work again. In testing the deck is insanely fun to play but feels very fragile, even with triple called by the grave. </em> <em>Side deck subject to change based on local metagame IRL and any suggestions you guys might have. </em> <em>I would also greatly appreciate any suggestions to the main deck too.

Long time Toon duelist here. I built this deck with a few things in mind.  First of all, Red-Eyes and Toon Dark Magician make for some pretty tight Rank 7 plays (Dracossack being my go-to, though you can make Red-Eyes Flare to be an ass around the endgame.) That said, it only made sense to put a Pankratops in there to help things along (because hey, nothing says fun cartoon world like throwing a huge arse dinosaur at folks.)  You will also see a mini Cyber Dragon Infinity engine in there as well. It's the bread and butter of the deck's defense.  Other than that, it's a pretty straightforward Toon deck that focuses on direct attacks. I mean, Elf and Sorceror do pretty okay on the whole draw/discard thing, but I made sure the deck had backups such as Evenly Matched to have a surprise ace up your sleeve.  Also, if you're wondering why this deck doesn't have Pot of Extravagances in it....well, you COULD add it, but this deck is a tad bit reliant on it to make some defensive plays."

From the get-go, you should be getting Supernaturalist out as fast as possible. I'm not saying that he'll last long, mind you, but you should get able to get a couple of resources out of him.  Strikes, Tombs, Blossoms and Imps are there to keep your opponent from doing...well anything, really. I didn't put Judgment in there seeing as how Imperial Tombs already pretends to be one (or two.) You can run Pot of Extravagance in place of Demise if you want, because save for Supernaturalist (and perhaps Wee Witchy,) you aren't going to dive in there very often.  Hidden Temples of Necrovalley does that Vanity's Emptiness used to do, and that's to stop Special Summoning. Monster effects are the shit right now.  (But do watch out for Typhoons.)"

Most of the time I'm able to either otk or ttk, tho this is a bit of a lower tier deck in the current meta. If your going to locals you should get far but if your going to go higher you'll have a bit of a harder time. Mainly because the deck is a bit of a one trick pony, it can do a few other things, but usually by time you get that going you've already lost.  However I'd still call this a really good deck! it's power and consistency is superb and can have good recovery. I'd prob give it a A tier, maybe low S."

There are several ways to make the actual orcust board like Isolde engine, so I decided to build a machine focused deck.  The main goal is different if playing first or second. If starting first the main idea is to start the same way of the previous version of the deck, but instead of going for Rusty Bardiche we summon Longirsu, The Orcust Orchestrator and go to Topologic Bomber Dragon with the maximum number of orcust effect monsters in the graveyard to trigger several times the Topologic effect and have a multi Raigeki-like effect. If starting second we can use the spam potential of the deck to go for a classic OTK strategy with Borrelsword Dragon and some smaller monsters.  Since the deck likes going first and has to go for the Orcust extra deck, we play some good starters and extenders to limitate the chances of brick and ensure some key plays under hand traps and disruption. So we have Jet Synchron, Card Trooper, Mecha Phantom Beast O Lion, Mecha Phantom Beast Tetherwolf and Scrap Recycler that are one card combos. Jet Synchron and O Lion can be normal summoned to go for Salamangreat Almiraj, so you can discard 1 card to resurrect Jet/summon 1 token to directly have a Knightmare Mermaid. Mecha Phantom Beast Tetherwolf creates a token when normal summoned and give an instant Mermaid. Scrap Recycler have a Foolish Burial-like effect to send one of the monsters that can trigger an effect in the graveyard and go for Mermaid. Lastly Card Trooper is a little hazardous due to the fact we can't predict the cards that goes to the graveyard, but with Machine Duplication you have litteraly a ""send 9 cards from the top of your deck to the graveyard"" and 3 monsters on top of that.  The others machines are of course the classical Orcust package with the knightmare that is searchable with Mermaid, and the cycle of effects to special summon from the deck, from the graveyard and from the banishment.  To support this strategy and potentially discard key machine monsters, we use a current Danger! package, that add spam potential too and can make you draw some important spell or traps to solidify the board. 1 Blackwing - Zephyros The Elite is added due to the ability of easily having cards in the graveyard, to bounce a Danger! monster and continue to spam when having a little extender.  Ash Blossom complete the monsters ratio to limitate the opponent's board if starting second.  Only a few number of spell and traps are needed. We play Called By The Grave to protect key monsters like Knightmare Mermaid from monsters hand traps and Orcustrated Return to draw 2 cards and discard important machines. Machine Duplication is a formidable extender, especially if targetting a Card Trooper, and can even target more monsters if Knightmare Mermaid is applying the attack drop. Foolish Burial gives instant access to combos and can just force out a hand trap to perform your loop more easily. Lastly we have the field spell, a powerfull card that makes almost all your deck trigger quick effects and is usefull to break opponent's boards with Topologic Bomber Dragon during his own turn, and Orcustrated Climax that is searchable during either turn and consists on a powerfull negate with a tuto added effect.  The extra deck can use some techs due to the build's orientation. We can play Hi-Speedroid Kitedrake to litterally pop all the field except itself or suppress all effects of the opponent's field to make easy OTKs thanks to the Mecha Phantom Beasts that are wind attribute. Borreload Savage Dragon is a good way to handle the opponent's ressouces if playing first and have enough ressources to summon it. Link Spider is another smaller tech to use your tokens and have an easier access to the Orcust links. Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess isn't used everywhere, but in this build, specially with Machine Duplication, can finish a board and heavily pressure the opponent with multiple negations. Topologic Bomber Dragon is the main removal if playing first, the deck is designed to trigger it's effect several times to break all the main monster zones each time, it can be a good finisher too thanks to it's burning effect. Borrelsword Dragon is easy to make and generates a lot of OTKs with any starting position. Lastly Salamangreat Almiraj is used to go for the Knightmare link-2 monsters by using the non-orcust machines and have solid 1 card starter combos (note that the knightmare monster's effects can make you discard key machine monsters to pop 1 card if playing second). Lastly the extra deck orcust package countains Galatea to search the field spell or the drawer/the countertrap if already having it in your starting hand, Longirsu to send 1 linked monster to the graveyard to bypass resilient monsters and Dingirsu to either get access to an important banished machine or suppress an annoying card. Note that Longirsu protects itself of the destruction effect of Topologic Bomber Dragon and Knightmare Cerberus can do the same thing in specific set ups, and if playing Topologic Bomber in the right extra zone you can arrange to summon Longirsu to point the other extra zone and pressure the only monster zone that Topologic can't reach.  &nbsp;  Now the extra deck  Like many same kind of decks, we are weak to a multi negates and can be hurt by consistant backrows so we play cards to soften these match ups :  Dinowrestler Pankratops is a free link material and can pop a dangerous card of the opponent, while Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay is a fair way to draw and get access to a better hand and protect some important monsters from destruction during the beginning of the main loop.  Artifact Lancea is a good in mirror match when going second to prevent from being stopped by a multi triggering Topologic Bomber, Orcusts heavily depending of the main monster zones to process.  Dimensional Barrier is an excellent weapon against pendulums and can simply stop their entire turn to have an almost instant win.  Finally Twin Twisters and Anti-Spell Fragrance are two different ways to handle consistant backrow focused decks, the first enabling a discard cost and the second being more durable and expeditive against Sky Strikers.  &nbsp;"
