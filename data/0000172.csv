The deck is centered around an FTK strategy that isn't my idea, you can find the one card combo <a href=""https://youtu.be/X1fhUDXwnFE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. You can get it<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en""> from any hand, you just need to summon Isolde. The deck is also capable of an FTK on second turn thanks to cards like lightning storm and dark hole.<span lang=""en""> If you draw a piece you can perform the combo summoning the 3rd Selene (ad use her to summon the piece from your hand) after you have given True Exodia to your opponent (you need to summon one extra monster with teasure panda after that, otherwise you can't summon unicorn at the end).</span> The main problem is that if you go second without your destructions your strategy is completely destroyed although you can still play. You must keep going with the combo (use True Exodia instead of Ventdra to make the second Selene) and use one of the pieces and ""Flamvell Guard"" or ""Water Spirit"" to summon ""Crystron Halqifibrax"" and with it's effect summon ""Red Rose Dragon"" and you get it. You can end with a nice board with ""Apollousa, Bow of the</span><span lang=""en""> Goddes"" (with four materials), </span><span lang=""en"">""Borreload Savage Dragon"" (with 3 counters on it) and ""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"". If you want to change something please notify me, I want to improve this deck.

<em><strong>Key pieces of the Deck:</strong></em>

1°- <strong>Doomking Balerdroch + Zombie World</strong>: Your main way to control the opponent, with <strong>Zombie World</strong> up,<strong> Doomking Balerdroch</strong> turns into a negate for any monster on the field or GY that activates an effect, or can take out a monster with the banish effect. Also, <strong>Zombie World</strong> locks any Type-based deck and can break some extenders or key plays on Non-Type-based decks (Ex.: Breaks the <strong>Invoked Engine</strong> of any Deck that is using this archetype, preventing them to get a LIGHT target for <strong>Invoked Mechaba</strong>)
2°- <strong>Rivalry of Warlords</strong>: This, combined with <strong>Zombie World</strong>, can lock your opponent for summoning any other monsters.
3°- <strong>Super Polymerization/Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>: Both are super good removal tools, both being able to take any 2 monsters your opponent haves, and together with<strong> Zombie World</strong>, can do a very good job breaking boards or interrupting your opponent."

Activate Magician's effect then chain it with Factory. <strong>Factory should resolve first.</strong>

Search Shark with Factory, then summon another copy of Magician using your first one's effect

Summon Shark when Magician comes out

Repeat until you have a full board then Xyz into whatever monster fits the situation.

&nbsp;

Keep in mind the above is your most preferable opener. It may take an extra turn to get rolling, but that's how Wind-Ups work. If you have a couple Dogs out with Rescue Cat with Factory on the field, activate a Dog's effect and Factory will still search, but Dog's effect is negated."

You really wanna special summon<a data-name=""Metaphys Daedallus""> Metaphys Daedalus with the eff of another Metaphys monster (Decoy, Tyrant or Ragnarok) to trigger his effect, not with S/T eff (in this case, don´t will trigger).</a>

The extra deck is optional, I only use this.

Zeroboros is one of the win conditions, but as I say, after 2 turns.

The final spell has arrived! OwO
La magia de fuego rápido acabará con todo lo que haya enfr","Deck creado por: Darklab

<strong>Objetivo:</strong> Crear un bucle de magias para quemar la vida del oponente con Rapid-Fire Magician. OwO

<strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/GxAmKfGIo6E &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

<strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>

Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!

<strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>
 	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>
 	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>
 	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>
 	<li>Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>
 	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>
 	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>
 	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>
 	<li>El deck aplica un burn virtualmente infinito, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Contras:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets y ladrillos.</li>
 	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>
 	<li>El deck es muy denso y no tiene acceso a protección.</li>
 	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li>

I was initially interested in the Painters because I remembered seeing them somewhere on a certain Yugituber's channel, but I didn't remember really in what context, and I was looking for a deck to play anyways, so I looked up some stuff and it took me a surprising amount of time to make a deck that I could feel comfortable was close to being an optimal construction of the pure version of this deck.

<span><strong><em><span>WHY WEATHER PAINTERS?</span></em></strong></span>

This is an archetype that revolves around the idea, of slowly building up a ton of advantage, being incredibly resilient while it's at it and also very brain intensive (seriously this might be one of the most mentally taxing decks I've ever played, but don't let that deter you!), it's not incredibly uncommon to see boards with every single monster and spell/trap space filled, with your opponent on their last legs with less than 20 cards left in their deck, a barebones board and a stacked grave/banish zone.

So if you like working your brain, looking for the most optimal play at every step of every phase, building massive boards with a ton of moving parts, and shrugging off handtraps and removal (given that you don't die on the second turn) this deck might just be for you.
<span><em><strong>So what does this deck do, anyways?</strong></em></span>

Glad you asked. <span><strong>First</strong></span>, the archetype's main gameplay mechanics are:
-Special summoning themselves from the banish zone when they banish themselves for cost during the standby phase of the next turn (not a once per turn so you can special summon multiple copies of the same Painter)
-Spells and Traps which grant effects to the Painters in their column or in their adjacent columns, that let them banish for cost (all of these are quick effects at the time of writing and only two are... pseudo hard once per turns, you'll see what I mean later)
And <span><strong><span>second</span></strong></span>: controls the first two or three turns of the game to get itself set up. You accomplish this with generic floodgate cards and interruptions, because this deck has the space and the ability to play them without hampering itself in the process, these interactions will be explained in further detail later on.

<span><em><strong><span>A rundown of archetype monsters to run in this deck</span></strong></em></span>

As for the specific effects of the in-archetype cards, the list is as follows:

<a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow</a>: Main searcher, upon normal summoning her, she <strong>place</strong>s an archetype spell/trap on the field so she dodges most handtraps by herself, as you are not adding the card to your hand before activating it. However, if you activate a <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a> before normal summoning her, you will be able to immediately banish her for cost after you trigger her <strong>place</strong> on field effect, making her untargetable with cards like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler and </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> , effectively rendering her immune to every handtrap except maybe Gamma, and even then you will still get to search your entire archetype with <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas.<em> Here I will mention that Every Painter comes back when they banish themselves for cost during the standby phase of the next turn, even if they get negated, and paying their cost is immediate, your opponent may not activate anything AFTER you declare the effect but BEFORE you banish, so even if they have a Lancea for example, activating it in response to your Painters' effects makes no difference, this is what makes them so strong at protecting themselves.
</em></a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Thunder"">The Weather Painter Thunder: Recycler, turns any continuous card you can/would like to get rid off into any archetype spell/trap card which is overall very helpful because you can turn off plenty of floodgates at will, and quickly adapt to whatever situation you're facing.
</a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>: One of the most flexible cards in the archetype, and the third most important card imo, it's effect allows you to recycle up to two of your archetype spells/traps by placing them back on the field, if another face-up The Weather <strong>CARD </strong>is sent to the grave, so this is one of the ways with which to protect your backrow. However, remember how I said this is one of the most flexible cards in the archetype? Well, not only does it only require any archetype monster or spell/trap for it's effect, it can also be used in tandem with Thunder's effect for a combo that can net you a plus 2 in card advantage, and three archetype spells/traps, this combo can also be used to reposition the archetype spells/traps to facilitate your plays or just fix an error in your placement. Beautiful card, 8/10 because I don't like cloud days.

<a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora: This card is a key player in keeping your backrow intact, as well as being a decently sized body and has a nifty combo with Cloud which I'll talk about in a moment, even if it rarely ever comes up. It's effect stops your opponent from targeting or destroying any face-up archetype spell/trap you control, and seeing how this card is easily summoned with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Rainbowed Canvas"">The Weather Rainbowed Canvas</a>, a card we'll get to later, it's a blanket protection effect from most removal effects in the game, unless they're using a card like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig The Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig The Ominous Omen, that allows them to banish without targeting, any card on the field or a card like </a><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. Aside from the blanket protection effect, this monster also has a nifty effect on normal summon, where it can <strong>place</strong> any archetype spell/trap on the field, from deck hand or grave; and as you may have noticed, she is indeed a level 6, requiring one tribute to normal summon, which in turn activates <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>'s effect, to search a card, and potentially plus 2 on her summon.

<a data-name=""The Weather Painter Sun"">The Weather Painter Sun: This is the last archetype main deck monster we'll be playing, mainly because their last monster The Weather Painter Rain, is way less useful on her own and her effect doesn't make her worth running another brick for, so unfortunately this is what we have to work with in the main deck. Fortunately this is a good note to end on, because this ol fella comes in very clutch and serves as a crucial pieces to complete your board of Painters, his effect allows him to revive himself from the grave at the cost of sending one of your continuous spell/trap cards to the grave, <em>AND IF YOU DO</em>, placing one archetype spell/trap card on your field, this limits his use to only being a late game support, when you have an archetype spell/trap in your hand at all times, and since he can come back from the grave, you can feel free putting him in spots where other Painters would be very vulnerable, because him getting destroyed doesn't translate into any meaningful loss for you, so you can save your battle protection for other painters, and again, his effect works in tandem with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud to plus off of his summon. Can be a bit bricky, but he offers too much in the way of supporting the archetype later on in the duel, that he makes up for it that way.</a>

<span><em><strong><span>Archetype spell/trap cards</span></strong></em></span>

Hello again! Now that we're done talking about the main deck monsters and how cool they are (I always imagined them banishing themselves and coming back, as going to the sky to paint then coming back down to chill out with the rest of their crew) we may now talk about the bread and butter, the meat and potatoes, the pellucid core of this archetype, which refracts disperses the sky light to create 7 different differently colored canvases for our Painters to use.

Or if you want to be less obtuse, we'll be talking about The Weather spell/trap cards, which all share the effect of granting an effect to every Painter in their same column, or any adjacent column, these effects all banish for cost, and they are all quick effects; and this is where things get interesting, because now it's not just about choosing the effects you want, but also which monsters will get which effects. I should note that we are excluding <a data-name=""The Weather Sunny Canvas"">The Weather Sunny Canvas</a> and <a data-name=""The Weather Cloudy Canvas"">The Weather Cloudy Canvas as they are only to play in casual builds, given that by themselves, they are pretty annoying bricks to draw into, with Sunny being a support card that's only useful later on, and Cloudy has an effect which can be used to protect your painters by being able to trigger at virtually any time, so you get a free banish for potentially 3 of your painters, it can also save you from some OTK situations, but it's not really any better than other cards you'd rather play, that don't hurt your consistency.</a>

<a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>: coincidentally, the best monster in the archetype has the best spell card in the archetype, as this card allows you to turn any Painter on the field into a searcher, and this can be used in a myriad of ways, however the ones you'll be using the most are, searching for turn one plays, or searching to dodge targeting effects. However, remember what I said about some of these cards being pseudo hard once per turns? Well, this card lets you activate it as many times as you want, with the restriction that you can't add cards to your hand from your deck for the rest of this turn except by drawing them ONLY IF you actually added a card to your hand, so what you can do is, banish multiple monsters to activate this effect, and not only will this be basically unstoppable, as the effect is technically a monster effect so you won't be disrupted by any targeting spell/trap removal, nor can they use targeting monster negation, nor can they stop this effect by only negating it once, they have to do it a maximum of three times to negate your one search, and you get to protect all of your monsters for your trouble from any field wipes or targeting effects, so you can chain cards which this card gave effects to (or any other card for that matter) immediately before you activate some sort of field wipe like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> or floodgate like <a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn, because you can basically fulfill their requirement whenever you want. (No Torrential does not miss timing on this, it's pretty awesome I know)
</a>

<a data-name=""The Weather Rainbowed Canvas"">The Weather Rainbowed Canvas: (REMEMBER THAT THIS CARD REQURIES THE OPPONENT TO HAVE A MONSTER SO YOUR MONSTERS CAN ACTIVATE IT!!!!) This card is kind of a spoiler for what is to come, as you can see an extra Painter there I didn't talk about yet in this card's artwork, but we'll get there when we'll get there, anyways, this is one of the best cards in this archetype, giving the ability to your Painters to tag out into any other Painter from your deck on a quick effect, that shares the same weird restriction as </a><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas, where you get to activate the effect granted by this card as many times as you want, however, you can only special summon from deck, using it, once per turn, this can be used with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora</a> or <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud for a quick effect protection for your other spell/trap cards, or at the end of a turn to sneak in an extra monster to summon during the next standby phase, another nifty combo you can do with this card and </a><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>, is tag in a monster, then immediately search another monster during your opponent's end phase, which will get you a plus two during your turn.
<a data-name=""The Weather Thundery Canvas"">The Weather Thundery Canvas</a>: This card grants your monsters the ability to return any monster they battle with to the hand at the start of the damage step, which is really good because it's non destroying, non targeting battle protection and monster removal, it also happens at the start of the damage step, so unless they want to negate the effect, they can't try to do anything weird when you activate this effect in order to try and dodge it. So effectively this is one way the deck leverages it's advantage to dismantle boards and get in for damage with the mediocre stats it has to offer (aside from Snow's defensive stat)

<a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas: For spell/trap removal, we have this card, it's effect allows your Painters to banish themselves with the goal of returning a spell/trap card your opponent controls to their hand, and this is quite useful for dealing with traps during your opponent's end phase, because any card you're banishing for cost at that point in time will come back during your next turn, also continuous spells and field spells fold to this card, because those cards' effects do not go off if they leave the field (with a couple of exceptions) so that's one way to lock them out of field/continuous spells that can only be activated once per turn, or whose effects can only be used once per turn. One way you can turn this card into an absolutely obnoxious spell/trap disabler, is using </a><a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance and returning all of their spells and traps to the hand during the end phase, your spells and traps can just be placed instead of set and activated from the hand in a lot of cases, and admittedly it does shutdown a great amount of decks. However, I don't recommend using this trick as it leaves you with nothing if they have a chainable spell/trap removal spell, which they can use during the draw phase to stop your activation, and you want to activate </a><a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> as soon as possible to get the most out of it, so you lose the element of surprise offered by other floodgates, and you have to pass on using one of your other archetype spells/traps in order to pull this lock off, and even then it's very fragile against a deck that can function properly without it's spells or traps, so if you do end up running <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance, keep it</a> as a side option, as it does shut down a lot of meta decks very effectively.

<a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a>: And here we are at our last archetype trap, this card lets your monsters banish themselves if a card is added from the deck to the hand (be careful of activating this on yourself if you're playing online) and in turn lets you banish the added card from the player's hand, and make them draw a card, this is a negative 1 in card advantage, however it's very effective against any specific combo decks which heavily rely on getting to certain combo pieces for their plays, it also banishes, so unless you're playing against Thunder Dragons, that card is effectively gone, never to see their hand again. Note that this effect isn't once per turn and can be activated multiple times, even on the card you made them draw, which is pretty fun but ultimately kind of useless.

Note that all of these effects stack, which means that based on your positioning, any given Weather Painter could have up to 3(4 but we'll get to that) effects on the board, when have you seen a monster with 3 awesome quick effects!

<em><span><span><b></b><span><b>Explaining</b></span><span><b> the rest of the deck</b></span></span></span></em>

In this section I will talk about my non archetype inclusions in this deck specifically, and mention some options you could opt to run instead
It's pretty simple what you want to accomplish with the rest of this deck really, you just want to survive your opponent's turn, and maybe keep a floodgate or two to smooth out the process of filling up your field and emptying your opponent's. I must also mention that we don't care if these become dead cards later on, as we can just search out whatever cards we need from the archetype.

two exceptions are the <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality and </a><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, which are just consistency boosters on your first turn, because you don't special summon anything on it meaning you can make use of them both and lose virtually nothing in the process.
(Of note is the fact that I swapped Prosperity+Duality combo for Extravagance, and adjusted the Extra deck to reflect that. Not everyone agrees on whether Prosperity or Extravagance is better in this deck, and I happen to be one of the people who prefer the latter, as I think more resources are more important to this strategy than just getting to your engine, ALSO I DID THE MATH ON THIS, AND WITH THE RATIOS IN THIS LIST, PROSPERITY MAKES A SMALL DIFFERENCE IN GETTING TO SNOW BUT NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY RUNNING IT OVER THE EXTRA CARD FOR ME)
As for the floodgates we are running in the main and side deck, we have: <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain, which only affects your monsters' on field effects so you can still use the effects granted by your archetype spells/traps. </a><a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure, because you pretty much never care to see your monsters go to grave (early on) and it shuts down a lot of decks if they don't have a way to deal with it, buying you time to get set up. </a><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos, for the same reason as our previous inclusion. (OLD TECH CHOICE BUT YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE IT) </a><a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a><a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">, this is what we use to dodge their S/T removal when we know we're going first</a>. <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter, is a card you always want to draw in your opening hand, disables most decks for one turn, and can save you when you're going second. Necrovalley is a very good card against a ton of relevant decks and does basically nothing to you (early on, as we can make use of the graveyard later on in the game), so of course we'll jump on the opportunity to completely kill all of the meta, at least for one turn. And finally </a><a data-name=""Droll And Lock Bird"">Droll And Lock Bird, this card is for really obnoxious draw a million cards decks, such as a decks running the Danger! engine, Drytron, Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika, to an extent, @Ignister, a whole bunch of rogue decks etc... because the name of the game here, is to not die, but also out advantage our opponent, meaning we're not in love with the idea of getting super out advantaged on the first/second turn.
Other generic cards include: </a><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute we can dodge this card pretty easily, and it nullifies a lot of the damage we'd otherwise be taking. </a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, pay your lifepoints, this card is always online, it protects your backrow when you're still vulnerable, and counters a lot of cards that screw this deck over like <a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall, or </a><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched, also disrupts combos, just be careful about using it when it only facilitates you getting OTKd. </a><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, (you can take this card out if you want, as it is incredibly pricy) this card is a godsend, it's such a useful card in today's metagame where there are so many decks which use only one type of monster, and it's non targeting non destroying removal!!!! WHAT?! (OLD) <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown, useful for interrupting stuff and serves as decent battle protection, just take their biggest monster and use it to block. </a><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, this card is good in pretty much every deck, moving on. <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters, the reason I went with this instead of cosmic cyclone, is because it's the best way to out backrow, that doesn't make you banish something, which is valuable if you get </a><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>d or <a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall</a>ed. <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, self explanatory. (OLD) <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched, clean up their board, and chill. </a><a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> Kaijus have good synergy with the Painters, as they can just bounce them back for future use, even during the same turn, which is pretty nice.

We also now run <a data-name=""LOSE 1 TURN"">LOSE 1 TURN</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>, we have the extra deck space to spare, so Punishment is really nice as an interruption, because popping cards on your opponent's is really overpowered in Yu Gi Oh. And L1T is incredibly good as a way to protect yourself from any OTKs and on summon effects.

Other options you can opt into: I don't recommend most of these for every purpose but they can serve to add something the deck needs, or just make it more fun and casual. I would like to start off by mentioning one of my favorite ideas while building this deck, running a million Kaijus and bouncing them back for invalidating boss monsters, and when you don't get too great a hand, you can always just have a Kaiju battle, this also gives you an excuse to run <a data-name=""Interrupted kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted kaiju Slumber</a>, which is always fun. <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>, if you really don't like monster effects. <a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>, if you're confident it won't be negated or destroyed, since you can always make it online and protect your monsters, while completely wrecking your opponent's board. <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>, you can get this card off the field with Thunder so there isn't too much to worry about, but good spell/trap removal deals with it just fine, and it doesn't stop your opponent from doing things completely it just kind of slows them down, many decks don't even care about getting hit by this card, so I don't run it. <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance, is an okay card and can absolutely win you games, however it brings with it many problems, as it doesn't disrupt anything, and doesn't stop monster effects, and is easily disposed of by </a><a data-name=""cosmic cyclone"">cosmic cyclone</a>/<a data-name=""twin twisters"">twin twisters, if they have those in their hand the turn you activate this card, still it can be quite obnoxious with </a><a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas. </a><a data-name=""Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen"">Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen, this card enables some combos with this deck, because </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Thunder"">The Weather Painter Thunder</a> can indeed get rid of it and replace it with <a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a>, to search <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow, whom you can normal summon to get two monsters and two archetype spells/traps, however this card isn't all that consistent, and it can sometimes brick your hands, when you could've gotten something to further your goal of staying alive for the first few turns, also it completely disables the use of </a><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality, because you're only looking to use that on turn one, and you're also looking to use this on turn 1, but do consider running it in more casual builds!
</a><a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat, I have not tested this card however it has the potential to be a great stalling card as well as giving you link fodder.</a>

<em><strong><span>The Extra deck!
</span></strong></em>This is where it gets good! We'll start off by talking about our last archetype card (and my personal favorite):

<a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow: This is the boss monster of the Archetype, requiring 3 archetype monsters for it's link summon, can NOT use all the same effects other Painters can use, with an average 2400atk points for a link 3. This card comes with two effects it can send itself to the graveyard when your opponent would special summon a monster to negate the summon and destroy the monster, however be mindful this can only be used if she was link summoned. Her second effect and the one most impressive, is that every archetype monster she points to can banish themselves to negate any card's/effect's activation. This is it, this is the late game threat your opponent's have to deal with, if they're somehow still clawing back to give you things to remove every turn, this is what will extinguish their resources, by this point you will have a lot of material to work with to feed her omni negate effect, and not many decks can get over three omni negates when they're gasping for resources.</a>

<a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder </a><a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician and </a><a data-name=""Number 47: Nightmare Shark"">Number 47: Nightmare Shark: 47 attacks directly, Downerd overlays on top of it, Zeus cleans it all up, and gives you an impressive 3000 atk beatstick with a quick effect field nuke, you want this to be your last play, when you've run your opponent out of stuff they can use, such as when they have an empty hand, and kill them on the next turn, you can make your Painters dodge the effect, but not the same could be said for your backrow, even tho it is recoverable, you probably won't need to do that. The Weather Painters are mostly level 3s, so this works out.
</a>

<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword: Good removal when you need it for an imperial Iron wall, or some other pesky thing you can't get rid of otherwise.
</a>

<a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: can buy you some time if you're trying to recover, easy to make.</a>

<a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax </a><a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon: big beatsticks.
</a>

<a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon </a><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: come in handy every once in a while.

<a data-name=""Lyna The Light Charmer, Shining"">Lyna The Light Charmer, Shining</a>: not yet out in the TCG, however there isn't much time left for it to do so, and when it does, be sure to run it as it is quite easy to make and can steal a good amount of monsters.

<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn: removal in case you need it, it's not too taxing to link into things because you have </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Sun"">The Weather Painter Sun, whom you can recur back to your field quite easily.</a>

<a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: use her before linking into your big beatsticks to make them immune to destruction.

<span><em><strong>Cards this deck loses to</strong></em></span>

Watch out for the following cards, and make sure you know how to deal with them, or at least know when to surrender.

<a data-name=""Imperial Iron Wall"">Imperial Iron Wall: blocks you from using your main gameplay mechanic, same as </a><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea.</a>

Evenly Matched: your well set up field is a prime target for this card. However, it's somewhat less obnoxious to deal with due to the fact that you can just make your Painters dodge it, it's not great going second against you because your field is very unimpressive at that point, but it still has the potential to do tremendous damage, this is why we have <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, nevertheless it banishes facedown, which stops the recursion effects you get from <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a> and <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Aurora"">The Weather Painter Aurora.</a>

<a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm/</a><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Getting hit by these... isn't the worst thing in the world, given that you can recover from them with <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>, and search <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">The Weather Painter Snow on their activation, provided you have the proper canvas, so you can set up for your plays next turn. However, now the chance of you dying goes way up, your only saving grace if they draw into these cards, is if you activated a </a><a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow"">, or had a </a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow""> ready.</a>

<a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One: this card doesn't really end the game for you, as you can just cycle through your painters on each standby phase, by activating their effect, summoning the next painter, activating that one's effect, and so on. It's still quite a hinderance, this is why we run </a><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters.</a>

<em><strong><span>THE SIDE DECK</span></strong></em>

This is a newly added section, specifically written for the latest update to my decklist as of writing. I will be underlining the thought process behind building this side deck, and what it means for anyone trying to play it.

What are we trying to side? And how are we trying to side? The current format (as of writing this) is very heavy on handtraps, you gotta have em, the more you can run the better your deck will fare, if you can't run that many, you'd better have a huge pay off (Infernoble, Drytron) or you'll be mercilessly interrupted and then destroyed by better decks running more handtraps, now as you can see we're not running too many Handtraps in the main deck, and before I keep going I have to say that a more handtrap heavy build of this deck (in the maindeck specifically) is absolutely worth experimenting with, that may prove to be the better way to play it, however I think the floodgates and trap line up + the handtraps we already run in the main are basically the best you can get for a first game against an unknown deck. Moreover, I think the list has a bunch of options to facilitate going second if you get unlucky on the die roll, <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring are obvious ones, but less obvious are </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring""> and </a><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">, which can ward off a couple potential otks, and you really just want to not die + preserve your resources, as long as you can do that, you have a chance.
Now that I've spoken in length about the main deck (Again) I have to tell you that the reason we are running mostly handtraps in the side deck, is so we can go into them during the later games, you can decide what is good after game 1, then fill up your maindeck with some of those options, you can also try to side into more handtraps to avoid spell and trap destruction ruining your entire gameplan during game 2/3, because why hope to draw into Judgment, if you don't even need it! Not much to say here other than </a><a data-name=""Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">, which is a very a popular handtrap in this format, and works against a lot of the best decks this format (Drytron, Prank kids are two examples) and is just a very nice handtrap to have, it also negates activations so it can be used during the damage!</a>

&nbsp;

And that about wraps it up for your introduction to this deck, I hope you learned something, and if you got to this part, you have my deepest gratitude for not making the 4 hours making this go to waste haha!

<span><strong>Sidenote</strong></span>: I will be making adjustments to this list as I see fit, in order to make it even more optimal, recent changes include adding <a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a>, in place of <a data-name=""Droll And Lock Bird"">Droll And Lock Bird, and putting in an extra </a><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Cloud"">The Weather Painter Cloud</a>, removing one <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a><a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">.
Some of these changes come courtesy of the Weather Painter discord
I have cut the </a><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turns because it disables our removal option with Thundery, and that's quite irritating, and after a bit of testing, this ended up being more than a minor hinderance, it's also quite high commitment to activate.</a>

Added three <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity and cut </a><a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">, and another copy of </a><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality.</a>

Instead of Lose 1 Turn we will be experimenting with <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole as we have enough main deck options to counter on field effects.</a>

Added in two <a data-name=""Solemn strikes"">Solemn strikes</a> as they do what <a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"">Gravedigger's Trap Hole and more, the cost of lifepoints is fine because we'll get to survive to play our game and potentially win
Removed Strike added back </a><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a><a data-name=""Gravedigger's Trap Hole""> and </a><a data-name=""NecroValley"">NecroValley, alongside a new card, </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>

With Shirokunishi's effect, you're able to banish a card from your opponent's field even during their turn. This quick effect once per turn combo can help with disrupting enemy combos.

I had created this deck in hopes that it could serve as a guide to future Karakuri Archetype players who would want to try out the Karakuri Archetype.

There are many cards that can be replaced in this deck build if you'd like to do so, these following cards are easily replaceable if you wish to run different cards in the deck:
<ul>
 	<li>Karakuri Strategist mdl 248 ""Nishipachi""
<ul>
 	<li>From my experience the bare minimum is just 2 copies of this card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Karakuri Watchdog mdl 313 ""Saizan""
<ul>
 	<li>From my experience the bare minimum is 1 copy of this card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Karakuri Bushi mdl 6318 ""Muzanichiha""
<ul>
 	<li>I mostly use this card as a Level 4 Non-Tuner Fodder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Karakuri Soldier mdl 236 ""Nisamu""
<ul>
 	<li>Another card that I use as a Level 4 Non-Tuner Fodder, but this card does help extend combat if you're up against a deck that relies on attacking monsters, allowing you to stall 3 attacks by summoning itself from the graveyard when it gets destroyed by battle and sent to the graveyard until you run out its copies.</li>
 	<li>Keep in mind that you can still summon other Karakuri monsters using Nisamu, I sometimes summon Nishipachi from my Deck using Nisamu's effect and change the battle position of the final monster if the opponent has 3 - 4 Monsters on their field, allowing you to start your turn with a Tuner provided Nishipachi doesn't get destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Karakuri Anatomy
<ul>
 	<li>A nice card that can help increase draw power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>De-Synchro
<ul>
 	<li>This is mostly a card that enables you to extend your combo. Keep in mind that if you revive a monster from the graveyard that was used as a synchro material for a synchro monster on your field, you will be unable to bring back the synchro materials of the synchro summoned monster even if they're back in the graveyard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Iron Call
<ul>
 	<li>This is mostly a card that enables you to extend your combo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Night Beam
<ul>
 	<li>This card is mostly for Backrow if you ever run into a deck with backrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

This deck also has a one card setup that would allow you to summon Bureibu on the field and put 2 Shirokunishis in your graveyard:
<ol>
 	<li>Summon Karakuri Merchant mdl 177 ""Inashichi"" to the field.</li>
 	<li>Using Inashichi's effect, add Karakuri Bonze mdl 9763 ""Kunamzan"" to the hand.</li>
 	<li>Special summon Kunamzan to the field using his own effect.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 ""Burei"" to the field using Kunamzan and Inashichi.</li>
 	<li>Special Summon Karakuri Gama mdl 4624 ""Shirokunishi"" to the field using Burei's effect.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X ""Bureido"" to the field using Shirokunishi and Burei.</li>
 	<li>Special Summon another Shirokunishi to the field using Bureido's effect.</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Karakuri Super Shogun mdl 00N ""Bureibu"" to the field using Shirokunishi and Bureido.</li>
</ol>
There are a lot of possible combos that this deck can start with that allows you to get Bureibu to the field immediately and the summoning/swarming engine can be faster with the right card replacements. You could even add more defensive cards like Hand Traps if you wanted to due to this Deck's many replaceable cards."

Apollussa
Number 38
Felgrand
Lancelot
Number 97
Knightmare gryphon
and anti-spell fragance set.

Normally its possible to do all except Knightmare gryphon 9 out of 10 hands.

First, have lv4 monsters on the field to summon dugares, this will give you resources.
Keep using ur dangers to bring out cards, if you for some reason, need to discard magic cards to increase the chance of summoning the danger do it.
Keep drawing cards, use the allure on snowws or dogmans, if u cannot use it on repeated danger in the hand, in that priority order.
Once you have 4 monsters, summon apollusa, then keep trying to have as many lv8 monsters as possible.

Once you have 2 lv 8, summon lancelot, activate any danger in the hand, that will cancel it and it will provide new resource in the graveyard.
then, summon draglubion.
Then felgrand if possible, at this point you probably have spell fragance set.

Life aint that easy always, so if u thing u are running our of resources when u are about to summon apollusa, then summon skull dread instead to keep the combo running.
Same with daigusto emeral.
If you need resources in the graveyard use the links that u have in the disposal, with/without activating its effects when needed (remember, Dark world does not activate on cost).
Also use the Danger! reponse team on ur own monsters to keep the combo flowing.

Requires practice, but is extremely consitent.

If you want to OTK, just summon Number 100 with dragublion, activate the effect and win."

As quantidades e tipos de cartas escolhidas foram inspiradas em outros Decks Iniciais, como os de Yugi e Kaiba. Como se trata de um Deck Inicial, ele costuma ser bem fraco em relação a monstros e estratégia, mas possui magias e armadilhas poderosas para dar suporte. Usei como referência cartas lançadas até dezembro de 2005, seja no TCG ou no OCG. Algumas cartas do deck nunca foram lançadas oficialmente para TCG. É um deck casual, com o objetivo de se divertir, duelando contra outros Decks Iniciais e até contra Decks Estruturais."

The larger aim of the deck is to make konami print more ojama playable's. What the deck does (on a good day) is follows.

A) Our plan B mostly ends up becoming plan A... summon dragoon.    ~I'm sorry.

B) Using the ojama engine to link climb into interactive boards, giving you some things to think about when your turn is over. If you consider the movement of cards from deck to hand; hand to field; field to GY; GY to banished; banished to deck. This looping of material is what *imo* should be the high focus of ojamas, as they feel most comfortable flowing in that circular motion creating the fuel for your plays.

C) Use blowout cards like ABC, Master of Beats, Underworld Goddess, Borrelsword and uhhhh. *cough*dragoon.... to simply win games you had no right winning!

&nbsp;

Enjoy the deck, make sure to take deliberate care when making your chain orders. Maintaining advantage with this deck just wont be possible if you dont resolve your desired effects in the most optimum order &lt;3

Good luck, Have fun!

(P.S please use I:P Masquerena and ojama duo together, it just works.)"

(ive made some updates to the deck and some cards will not show up, just read em and you should figure out what they do)

Ive also decided to attempt a detailed explanation, so here it is

Monsters:

Nibiru- 3 copies, a really great hand traps in this format.

ash-3 copies, also very good in this format

lancea-3 copies, just like the other 2, great in this format

prankratops- great to put pressure on your opponent

wyvern-great card, searches your cards.

frame-does what wyvern does but with a cost

Reactor dragon:pretty good card

Fortress:can help apply more pressure

Hunting hound:also a good card

metalcruncher-youll see why when i explain redeployment

irradiator-same with metalcruncher

citadel-same with metalcruncher

Spells:

fortress-great card, stops targeting

catapult-very op if you have wyvern or frame in hand (it can give a free gear giant)

ancient gear fusion-searchable and can be super useful sometimes

overload-great extender for possibly 2 gear giants

power bond:gives otk potential

redeployment-Great card, 3 options for this card, 1.search citadel and fortress, 2.search ira and medal. 3. search megaform and fortress

urgent schedule: VERY op, ill give a combo for this card down below

Side decks your choice

Urgent schedule combo: activate urgent, summon frame/wyvern (wyvern is better) then use there effect on summon (in case of frame, just use eff) add ancient gear fusion, activate it, fuse frame/wyvern with golem and 2 ancient gears from deck, and thats how you get gear giant with a 1 card combo."

You can find a long detailed Archfiend guide over on Reddit that <a>I wrote recently</a> and got accepted into the guide archives!

The main purpose behind this deck is pure beatdown. High level, high attack Archfiends like Emperor and Empress allow you to fight your way through your opponent's resources in battle, and our favourite skeleton makes his appearance here too! Summoned Skull can bring itself to the field through the fusion monster, Archfiend's Manifestation, while Archfiend Empress helps to keep your field established with high-level fiends.

I also like Statham very much, thanks to him this series has gotten fresh, plus his lyrics for Hobbs and vice versa are great. <a>https://nofilmschool.com/u/benedetta</a>

The promising action role-playing game ""Scarlet Nexus"" delivers stylish anime-inspired graphics, <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/arcaneseriestv/comments/n4ofza/arcane_tv_series_season_1/</a>cool battles and a somewhat complicated world construction.

MovieZine got the chance to audition for the first three hours of the upcoming Bandai Namco Studios game ""Scarlet Nexus"", which comes to Playstation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and PC on June 25.<a>https://www.reddit.com/r/Skazhenevesillya3/comments/n4qep8/скажене_весілля_3/</a>

The game is an action role-playing game set in a future Japan, where the group Other Suppression Force (OSF) protects the city of New Himuka from nasty creatures, all presented with delicious anime-inspired graphics. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/wrathofmankr/comments/n4rggo/영화_캐시트럭_다시보기/</a>

The distant future in which ""Scarlet Nexus"" takes place is a high-tech world, purely aesthetically inspired by 90's Japan. After finding a substance in the brains of some people that gives them psychic powers,  <a>https://architizer.com/firms/maxites-ton-dromon-9-2021-tainia-online-ellinikoys-ypotitloys-greek-subs/</a>      society is more connected than ever with visible interfaces everywhere in the cities.

However, not everything is peace and joy, as mysterious creatures called ""The Others"" which are strange combinations of animals, people, plants and everyday things rain down from the sky to hunt brains. Here we meet the military group OSF (The Other Suppression Force),<a>https://www.reddit.com/r/blackwidowja/comments/nbfpo4/映画ブラックウィドウのフル動画を無料で観られる/</a> where the two playable main characters Yuito Sumeragi and Kasane Randall are recruited. At the beginning of the game, you get to choose who you want to play as, so that you get to see the action from different perspectives, which are, however, intertwined in different ways.

In this deck, 2500 is a low number.","Step 1: Get Boss Stage.

Step 2: Harr &amp; Utgarda.

Step 3: ...

Step 4: Profit.

&nbsp;

Key Combos:

Condemned Witch gets you Forbidden Droplet

Condemned Witch &gt; Loptr on opponents turn.

If you have boss stage, never tribute your Loptr, tribute the fairy tokens generaided by Boss Stage instead.

First get Harr. Then get Utgarda on a later turn.

If you have boss stage, try not to tribute your Harr or Utgarda, tribute the fairy tokens generaided by Boss Stage instead.

World Legacy will allow you to cheat out a 9 star in hand, or 2 of them temporarily. If you cheat out 2, they will die at the end of the turn, so XYZ them ideally for Jorm.

Jorm + Harr = Enemies Conceding. DO NOT USE JORM ON DRAW STEP! Jorm makes them draw, and then feed him. Their draw triggers Stage and Harr. You get another Generaider and they discard a card.

Keep THEIR stuff in Jorm's belly, detach YOUR stuff back to your grave.

Utgarda is so much fun... for you.

When all of the above isn't enough: Kaiju Raigeki Feather Super-Poly Slumber Droplet Phantom Infinitrack Zeus them until they have nothing left. Leave NOTHING standing.

The desperation move: When you can't find Boss Stage, tribute Loptr for Mardel and pull it out of your deck. Loptr and Boss Stage are the key to your deck, but Stage is more important because it will get Loptr again.

Remember Boss Fight works, but it does give your opponent +1 card, and should be used ideally with a Harr on the board to cancel that out. (Which you can achieve pre-Boss Stage with World Legacy.)

Hela is for the long games where you need to get back your Bosses that have died. Hela cannot get back a Hela, so try to keep her alive to keep your recursion going.

I don't run hand traps because I play with friends. They are in the sideboard should you be looking to tweak the deck to your liking.

The extra deck consists of 5 Super Poly targets, 5 XYZ's, and 5 empty slots for your own favorite techs.

&nbsp;

TLDR:
Stage get Loptr and Fairy Tokens.

Loptr kill Fairy Token for a boss.

Boss kill Fairy Tokens for value.

Win Game.

&nbsp;

Manual: (Ideally you tribute Fairy Generaider Tokens)

<strong>Stage</strong>: Get a Generaider when <strong>opponent draws</strong>. Make fairies on <strong>opponents turn</strong>.

<strong>Loptr</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to get a Generaider from <strong>Deck</strong>.

<strong>Hela</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to get a Generaider from <strong>GY</strong>.

<strong>Dovelgus</strong>: <strong>Tribute X</strong> to get X Generaiders from <strong>Hand</strong>.

<strong>Harr</strong>: <strong>Tribute 2</strong> to <strong>Negate and Destroy</strong> anything. (Also enemy discards 1 if they draw 1.)

<strong>Utgarda</strong>: <strong>Tribute 2</strong> to <strong>Banish</strong> something.

<strong>Nidhogg</strong>: <strong>Tribute 1</strong> to negate and destroy a ""Special Summon""...? I dunno...

<strong>Mardel</strong>: <strong>Draw Boss Stage</strong>.

<strong>Trias</strong>: <strong>Tribute 3 Fairies (Specifically)</strong> to <strong>Destroy 1 and Draw 2</strong>. (<strong>Can be activated from GY</strong>.)

It's not competitive but can be good fun. It's a grindy deck that does not win on turn 1.,"The goal is to go second with this deck.

All the ursarctic cards can be used on the opponent's turn but keep in mind that the level 8 effects only trigger when there is already an Ursactic on the field. Try to get any level 7 out first, but preferably Mikpolar as he searches any other Ursactic monster.

Level 7: Mikbilis SS another Ursactic from hand; Mikpolar searches the deck for an Ursactic monster; Miktanus recycles an Ursactic monster from the GY, this includes the synchro monsters!

Level 8: Megabilis banishes from GY; Megapolar destroys spell/trap; Megatanus flips a monster to face down defense position.

Use the Kaiju's as tribute fodder for the Ursactic. Ofcourse you can use them to get tribute an opponent's monster if needed.

The Melffy Catty can SS itself during your endfase. During the opponent's turn you can use it's effect to bounce to the hand to search a level 7 Ursactic monster to keep the combo's going.

Since there are no normal summons in the Ursactic line up, you can use Windwitch: Snow Bell to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon with any level 7 Ursactic Synchro monster after you used their effects. Snow Bell gives Crystal Wing an added layer of protection. I prefer going into Grand Chariot to pop two cards, then synchro into Crystal Wing or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi.

Yokotuner is your other possible normal summon. This card lets you SS any other tuner from the hand or GY, this means your Windwitch or any level 8 Ursactic monster.

Interrupted Kaiju Slumber is a ""get out of jail card"" when the enemy board is overwhelming you. Same for Raigeki.

Ursactic Departure is great to get the cards you need into your hand. Ursactic Slider lets you SS an Ursactic monster so you can SS a synchro, synchro it off or use it as tribute fodder.

Ursactic Big Dipper lets you tribute an Ursactic monster from the GY once per turn instead of from the hand. The 7 counter effect can come up but this doesn't happen very often.

The trap let's you pay 700 life points to bring an Ursactic from the GY to the hand during your turn and during your opponent's turn. Use this to recycle your synchro Ursactic monsters and to keep the combo's and interruption going. It also let's you SS an Ursactic monster during the opponent's turn if you have a lvl 7 and lvl 8 Ursactic monster on the field. If your Ursactic synchro is destroyed by battle while the trap is face up, you can let the opponent shuffle cards into the deck so they have 7 cards combined in their hand, GY and on their field.

&nbsp;

<span>Extra deck</span>

If you summon with Yokotuner you can go into a link play (I:P Masquerena/Knightmare Pheonix) before you start combo'ing with the Ursactic cards. This can give you an Accesscode Talker/Knightmare Unicorn on the opponents turn with a possible Borreload Savage with 2+ negates during your turn after that.

Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Draco Berserker of the Tenyi for the negates.

Number 38 Hope Harbinger if you have two level 8 Ursactics and haven't used their effects."

Thanks everyone for giving me so much support and help, I know we all had a bumpy ride together so far, like beating the world record on deck comments, having to wait out for WAY too long for that speedroid support (at least it didn’t disappoint), watching the whole meta change with just 3 hits in one banlist, and seeing reptiles finally becoming good! </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I’ve improved so much sense I joined this site and it’s great to be able to talk yugioh with others! Where I live no one around here likes yugioh except me, screw that we don’t even have a locals! So I though loving the game I never really got to talk about it with others. Being here means a lot to me and honestly I’m really happy to have made this account.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Alrighty, enough with the emotional stuff, let’s get down to the important thing here: the deck and the combo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Miscellaneous</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I play this card purely to have quick access to booster raptor as a free bonus body, I’m just a big sucker for anything that can SS in a deck so this got three slots.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Atlantean dragoons</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Atlantean dragoons got three slots for being a vital part of the one card combo this deck comes with, its for searching screw serpent, to make sure I’m safe if I open one (because if I had 2 it wouldn’t work at all) I play 3.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Screw Serpent</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">T.G. Screw Serpent got three slots for being one of the best cards T.G. has to offer, your going to search this card with Atlantean Dragoons in your main combo. Coming with a monster reborn effect and it’s releveling this monster is absolutely crucial to play at 3 in a T.G. deck.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Deep Sea Minstrel</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Deep Sea Ministrel is only here for the nibru safety and for the fact that I can spare it during my one card combo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Warwolf </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Warwolf is one of the original monsters T.G. has, it provides free access to an extra body and it can chain block negates to help keep your plays going so it’s 3 slots.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Metal Skeleton</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Metal Skeleton got a slot for its graveyard effect to layer protection and nothing else, other than the graveyard effect it’s really just a brick so I don’t like playing any more than one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Dragon Cannon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Come on, we always have to have dragons, I mean this is yugioh, right? Seriously though, this monster is an extender that I can’t do without, it’s also a soft OPT so you can do it’s effect twice or even more! Otherwise though I really don’t like playing more than two.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Striker</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the original T.G. Monsters! Striker has always been a 3 of in T.G. decks, even these days people run 3 striker and no less!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Deep Sea Diva</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now this is the starter of the one card combo in the deck, opening diva means a two layers of protection Halberd Cannon. Because it’s just that good!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is at two of in case you open it and Striker, or it and Diva, so that way you can still proceed with the combo as normal.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Gear Zombie</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I play 2 of this card because it’s a free tuner, I might’ve played more but space issues came up and you that already have plenty of tuners to work with.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Booster Raptor</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another one of the older T.G. monsters! Miscellaneous gets played at 3 for this card so I also gave it 3 slots.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 T.G. Drill Fish</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Drill Fish is simply a free body, it’s piercing damage effect is just an added bonus.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Cyber Magician</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Cyber Magician is an important card to play in case you can’t swarm enough but it also clogs a little so I only recommend playing one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Tank Grub</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card is like Tech Genius’s idea of O’Lion (RIP) and is an important piece to the main combo of the deck.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Deep Sea Aria</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Purely to search Deep Sea Diva, no other reason I would even play this card</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 One for One</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One for One gives you access to summon half of your deck, so why not play it?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Reinforcement of the Army</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is purely to search striker, nothing else.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Halberd Cannon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The main combo in the deck can one card this monster out, which is one of the trickiest things in the game. Halberd Cannon is able to monster negate and has a floating effect as well on a 4K beater that’s already getting 2 layers of protection on average.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Shooting Star Dragon T.G. EX</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Shooting Star Dragon is the floated monster for Halberd cannon, you’ll find it really useful for its protection and self revival in the grind game.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Baroness De Fleur</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Baroness is a negate who can recycle and summon monsters from the graveyard. It’s a great synchro monster in general and it definitely is worth playing in decks like this one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Borreload Savage Dragon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Savage Dragon is a twin negate with halq going to your graveyard extremely often, you can also use it on Trident Launcher too but that doesn’t come up as often.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Deep Sea Prima Donna</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Prima Donna is a monster that can summon a water monster from your deck, it’s useful then your playing the deep sea engine in a synchro heavy deck.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Hyper Librarian</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Hyper Librarian’s constant draws is what made synchron so good in terms of card advantage I’d play more of him but you’re only allowed one per deck because it’s that good, so I’ll take what I can get (I mean, if you had three out then every time you summoned a synchro you would draw three, which can get you access to another synchro).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Power Gladiator</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Power Gladiator is only here because I needed a level five non tuner T.G. Synchro for the main combo, and I felt that I couldn’t afford to use Hyper Librarian when I could use it in other combos and not needlessly send it to the graveyard.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 T.G. Star Guardian</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Star Guardian is a really good T.G. card in general acting as an extender in form of what is essentially a monster reborn, I couldn’t go without it and it’s used in the main combo as well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Martial Metal Marcher</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Metal Marcher is only here to extend, it stepping stones you with Hyper Librarian and gives you more tuners to work with.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Recipro Dragonfly</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dragonfly helps you get the Shooting Star float set up and it’s level is vital to summoning Halberd Cannon.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Formula Synchron</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Formula Synchron is a free draw on summon and a synchro tuner which I need for certain things so I couldn’t turn it down.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The sheer amount of level ones and their self summons led me to play this card to be able to solidify my position on the field for a ton of bounces.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 T.G. Trident Launcher</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The T.G. link monster, Trident Launcher is an essential card to play in any proper T.G. deck these days for being able to do a mecha phantom beast auradon. Summoning a T.G. each from the graveyard, hand, and deck! And to top it off, T.G. synchros it points to become untargetable by opponents card! In my opinion this is the best T.G. card in the game and I will stand by it. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Crystron Halqifibrax </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Halq is played in so many different decks it’s amazing! It’s a great extender and really helps me out in my combo.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So I keep mentioning a combo, time to explain. This deck has a one card combo to summon T.G. Halberd Cannon pointed by Trident Launcher with Shooting Star Dragon and Metal Skeleton in the graveyard! Want to know how? I’ll be explaining the T.G. one card combo I discovered on my own down below.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So T.G. isn’t exactly linear by any means. Its really just work with what you opened in your hand. Trident Launcher requiring a T.G. to be present in your hand makes T.G. comboing that much harder as well, but pulling off a good Trident Launcher can take you a long way, even going as far as summoning Halberd Cannon! I just found that Deep Sea Diva can help you set up EVERYTHING for a perfect Trident Launcher. And the only reason why this works is because Screw Serpent was made as a Sea Serpent. Ready for the combo? Okay, let’s go.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Normal summon Deep Sea Diva</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Diva’s effect to summon Neptabyss</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Neptabyss to mill Atlantean Dragoons and add another one to your hand</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first Dragoon searches Deep Sea Ministrel</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Send Ministrel and Dragoon to your graveyard to rip a card out of your opponent’s hand</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your second Dragoon can search T.G. Screw Serpent</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Link Diva and Neptabyss to Halqifibrax</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Halqifibrax summons T.G. Tank Grub</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Link Halqifibrax and Tank Grub to summon Trident Launcher (here’s where things start getting sweaty)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Trident Launcher’s effect to summon the Screw Serpent in your hand, the Tank Grub in your graveyard, and hopefully the Metal Skeleton that may or may not be in your deck. (If your Metal Skeleton is in your in your hand summon a Screw Serpent from your deck and the Metal Skeleton in your hand)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(Little note in case you get confused by the next part: Tank Grub can be treated as a non tuner for the synchro summon of a T.G. monster) </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune Tank Grub with Screw Serpent to summon Star Guardian.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Star Guardian and Tank Grub’s effects to summon a token and recycle Screw Serpent to your hand.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Star Guardian’s effect to summon Screw Serpent from your hand</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Screw Serpent’s effect revives Tank Grub</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune the T.G. token provided by Tank Grub with Screw Serpent to summon Power Gladiator</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Using Screw Serpent’s second effect relevel Metal Skeleton to one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune the newly level one Metal Skeleton with Tank Grub for Recipro Dragonfly</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Tune Power Gladiator with Star Guardian for Shooting Star Dragon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Use Recipro Dragonfly’s special ability to send Shooting Star Dragon to the graveyard and summon all synchro monsters that were used for its synchro summon, like Star Guardian and Power Gladiator for example</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now Star Guardian tunes Power Gladiator and Recipro Dragonfly to summon Halberd Cannon to a zone Trident Launcher points to!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Trident Launcher protects Halberd Cannon from being targeted by your opponents effects and the Metal Skeleton in your graveyard can save it once from being destroyed as well! Then if they still manage to top it you can float Shooting Star Dragon from your graveyard! It’s a pretty powerful setup but it only has one negate sadly. That being said Halberd Cannon is extremely tricky to summon manually so one carding it is quite impressive!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Thanks again for looking at this build and I’ll see you next time!</span></p>"

Insane Speedroid support from Duelists of Whirlwind, arguably makes the deck similar to Salamangreat while having more toolboxes. We're aiming to summon the new lv3 Speedroid synchro-tuner either for synchro climbing or searching trap. The combo and duel is in the video below. If we start from link2 Rubber Band Shooter, we banish lv6 or 7 synchro depends on which line can guarantee a synchro (pay attention if we already use Taketomborg too). Also why we dont run more Car-Turbo because it conflicts with the new lv3 synchro (both tuner) and it can only be a starter for the link2 (a choke point and vulnerable to Nibiru). We dont dun the double Crystal Wing strategy because it dies to a Zeus, we'd rather have Clear Wing Fast or the trap.

<span>Hello and welcome to my updated Invoked Ogdoadic deck profile!! I decided to write out a detailed deck description for this one because most of you here are new to the deck and this is not the typical Ogdoadic deck profile. This is inspired off of 2 second place lists (from remote duels) and they both used the Chaos Engine as well!! The chaos engine is a great addition to this deck because they add versatility, consistency and card advantage to the overall deck. For example, you would normally need to open snake rain or nunu to combo but opening Aliester + Space OR white dragon OR black dragon can get you to freal imps which can search out your nunu!! The synergy is just amazing if you ask me. The main goal of a typical Invoked Ogdoadic list is to turbo out Mechaba and as many negates as possible (Including Ogdoabhyss, the boss monster) but this is not your typical Ogdoadic list!! This list focuses on getting out Caliga to the field (VFD basically) and protecting it with things like Dingirsu (protects it from being destroyed by literally anything) and Dragoon (do I even have to say anything here??). All the topping lists have been running Caliga. The basic combo (so many ways to do this, check my youtube video for more details) ends on Dingirsu + Dragoon + Caliga and also has Aliester in hand and the entire GY set up for next turn!! It’s also only a 2 card combo, making it more consistent and easy to achieve. I really hope you enjoy and let's dive right in!!</span>

<a> </a>

<span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, deck explanation and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!! I highly recommend you check out my video for a complete understanding of this deck.</span>

<b>Extra deck stuff - </b>

<a> </a>
<ol>
 	<li>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Mechaba</b><span> - have this just as as alternate to Caliga, solid card that can make your combos nibiru proof and also serves as an Omni negate</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Caliga</b><span> - the main negate/win condition of the deck</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Augoeides</b><span> - this also serves as interruption and is cool going 2nd because it can pop a card on the field as soon as it’s summoned. It can also gain attack by banishing fusions from the GY, so it’s pretty good going 2nd. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>King of the Feral Imps</b><span> - can search out any reptile and is very easy to make, you need this for combos and for the deck to function. </span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Abyss Dweller </b><span>- great card, easy to make, great against any deck that utilizes the graveyard</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Rikka XYZ </b><span>- you can make this easily as well and when you tribute it (w/any abhyss monster) you can summon the tree beast xyz from your extra deck (it’s an Omni negate) </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Divine Tree Beast</b><span> - can be summoned w/the rikka xyz and it serves as an Omni negate</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Dingirsu</b><span> - you need this to protect Caliga from being destroyed by battle and card effects (like lightning storm) </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Draglublion - </b><span>can summon any number xyz from the extra, main purpose is to make numeron dragon and go for game</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Numeron Dragon - </b><span>you make this w/draglublion and when you summon it you can go for a 9000 attack OTK!!</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Hope Harbinger </b><span>- you need another “number” xyz to stack on numeron to summon it w/draglublion so you have this. Sometimes you can make draglublion going 1st and you can stack hope w/numeron as material for an additional spell negate</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Moon Maiden</b><span> - just in case, you have this for invoked combos (if abhyss stuff does not work out)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Verte </b><span> - to make dragoon</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Dragoon</b><span> - Omni negate and indestructible body, serves as another way to protect Caliga </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Reptilian </b><span>- great going 2nd and can search any reptile</span></li>
