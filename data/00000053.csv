Yubel remains the best way to play Branded, and its powerups is an indirect buff to Albaz and friends. In addition to the regular playstyle of Branded, Yubel can now be used as a monster negate engine - effectively granting the deck an extra 3 copies of Called by the Grave. The Yubel cards are fairly minimal and it is composed of 5 cards. It is comprised of 3 Nightmare Throne, 1 Spirit of Yubel and 1 OG Yubel. Upon activation, Nightmare Throne destroys in deck Spirit of Yubel, which floats into the OG Yubel from deck. From there, a Phantom of Yubel can be summoned, granting Branded another way to deal with handtraps like Ash Blossom! Phantom of Yubel grants a higher success rate for Branded Fusion to successfully resolve - thus winning you more games!&nbsp;<br /><br />Yubel can also break boards and bait handtraps, since most gamestates are monster interaction based nowadays, the opposing player will be forced to prematurely use their interruption in an effort to stop Phantom of Yubel from coming out! After Yubel has sufficiently used up your opponent's interruption, you can go for your regular Branded plays unimpeded, without fear of Ash Blossom or Nibiru!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The Yubel cards also aren't really ""bricks"" since they can be discarded to the GY as part of your Branded combos. If you happen to have both Yubels in the GY (through Branded Fusion, Grass Grows Greener, etc.) you can also make Phantom of Yubel relatively free!&nbsp;<br /><br />While not entirely game changing and it doesn't largely change the strategy, the ""Yubel engine"" grants another layer of protection of Branded.

This isn&rsquo;t just a card; it&rsquo;s the embodiment of divine power, summoned by the legendary trio: Slifer the Sky Dragon, Obelisk the Tormentor, and The Winged Dragon of Ra.</p><p>😱 Now, imagine the tension rising as you finally gather the three Egyptian Gods on your field. The moment you tribute them to summon Holactie, your heart races! This card&rsquo;s summon cannot be negated. No tricks, no traps&mdash;just pure, unadulterated power. And let&rsquo;s be real: the look on your opponent&rsquo;s face when they realize they&rsquo;ve just lost is priceless!</p><p>🌌 Let&rsquo;s talk about our trio of divine monsters. Obelisk the Tormentor is a force to be reckoned with. His ability to wipe out your opponent&rsquo;s monsters is like a thunderstorm clearing the skies. But beware!

(I just went with stardust warrior because barrone is banned but it used to be barrone) Ultra Polymerization is fantastic for both summoning first of the dragons and bringing our lord and savior back to the field to use for a&nbsp; gachi gachi to crash and protecc itself so you can summon zeus. Fun fact: first of the dragons is unaffected by zeus so it can survive the nuke. the instant fusion is used for the level 2 allvain which is just amazing for either synchro, xyz or link plays. One of your dragons get banished? bring that dude back with the guarddragon pisty! dont know what to do with 2 petit dragons? make a spheres and get the third one out of the deck! Afraid of ash?

To do this, I expect you would need a lot of card advantage so therefor I use pot of desires and pikaia. I have not tried the deck yet, but I will shortly. Any advise on what to change, without changing the whole premise of the deck is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>"

Let's burn it up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/euFHIl-96QU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Discard Enchanter + Parasite to GY with Ravenous. Next, when you have four monsters and nothing more, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Black Luster Soldier with its ability but don't banish Ancient and Level 1 DARK monsters by accident. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>2) Use ""Monster Reborn"" to revive Ancient alongside two more monsters but reserve 2 x Level 1 monsters for future use. Next, play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" and target on Ancient, setting the level of your monsters to 7. Then, XYZ Summon Arise-Heart with these three, right behind any Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) to your preference.</p><p>3) Revive a monster and Link Summon Reprodocus with it and Saryuja, above where Arise-Heart is. Next, revive Enchanter. Then, bring forth 2 x Level 1 monsters excluding Parasite and XYZ Summon Promenade...</p><ul><li>If you have noticed, playing ""Primal Seed"" feeds Arise-Heart and we can progress even further with Enchanter. So long as you don't discard Sanctuary + Reborn by accident besides ""Primal Seed"" with Enchanter, which are your combo pieces, all is well.</li></ul><p>4) When Arise-Heart has 20 or more materials, activate Reprodocus to change the&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>of Arise-Heart to&nbsp;<strong>Winged Beast.</strong> Next, play Sanctuary and attach Arise-Heart into Promenade.</p><p>5) Finally, revive Parasite and Fusion Summon Nightingale by using Parasite + Promenade as materials. Raise the level of Nightingale and launch some fireworks for your glorious victory!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"" + ""Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Kashtira Arise-Heart"" can be found within ""A Warrior of Seething Anger"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Not to mention its capacity to interact with every single turn that is played, slowly shifting the power back to yourself when your turn comes around. At the same time as this however, this deck list has the incrediable capacity to just end simple, play slow and wait on traps, you can summon a melffy catty, set 3 and hold some cards like maxx c or swift scarecrow, allowing you to take your time developing into something more powerful as everyone tears eachother to shredds. In doing this however you do run the risk of getting OTK'd, as without the right opening hand, you will not be able to just hold onto your cards. This is why I have chosen rescue cat as my DM, Rescue cat has the amazing ability to get you litterally anything you need. Most games I found myself fully commiting to the first turn play, having to wall up with a melffy wally and a few defensive cards. Summoning kerass and ojama pink from deck off Cat to make Melffy of the Forest, searching out wally who will summon pony and puppy. Pony would bring back Kerass for turn 2 and puppy would summon any melffy needed for the situation. It is a versitile consistently annoying midrange deck with some funny little options like: the one polly for a 2 card off rescue cat Koalo-Koala, pinpoint landing providing draw power, grave of the super ancient organism stumping most decks and Nat beast turn one with a full hand of melffy's and a red reboot.<br /><br />As for end goals of the deck, there is very few possibilities. You either punch in with big extra-deck bodies, or sit on looping melffies and Ronin Racoon until everyone kills eachother.</p>"

For example, the Bystial package allows Thunder Dragon to enter recycle cards, maintain card advantage, provide massive level 6/8 bodies on board, and apply pressure with various removal effects as well as with high 2500 ATK. Bystials also banish both light/dark monsters from the GY, allowing Thunder Dragon monsters to trigger their effects even during your opponent's turn. The Zombie Vampire, easily accessible due to the rank 8s in this deck can mill and summon monsters from either GY for more plays! S:P Little Knight banishes your GY your Thunder Dragon monsters, triggering their effects!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Colossus and friends have certainly come back with a vengeance with the September 2024 banlist, this time with new powerful friends!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The original Thunder Dragon and Thunder Dragonmatrix are cut to fit the other supporting archetypes in the deck. Only 3 Dragondark, 2 Dragonhawk and 2 Dragonroar are used. 3 Batteryman Solar is the best normal summon the deck has, since it simultaneously sends to GY a Thunder Dragon on summon (setting up to be banished to trigger their effects) and generates a token so that it can be linked away for Cross-Sheep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>BYSTIAL </strong>cards compose a large chunk of cards in this deck, functioning simultaneously as combo pieces (to banish Thunder Dragon cards), interruption (banish handtraps + removal), and grindgame (Branded Regained). 2 Lubellion and 2 Saronir allow for Branded Regained to set up. 1 Magnumhut, 1 Baldrake and 2 Druiswyrm round out the Bystial monsters. Finally, 1 Branded Regained is used since it is highly searchable. With Bystial cards enabling banishment from the GY and the Thunder Dragon's effects triggering when getting banished, it seems like these two archetypes were made for each other! They support each other's weakpoints and enable each of their effects. 2 Assault Synchron are used since it allows easy access to Genex Return Zero, Bystial Dis Pater and Chaos Angel. Assault Synchron can also summon Dis Pater from the GY/banished if it is tributed or banished, especially by Lubellion's effect.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A sizeable <strong>CHAOS </strong>engine is also used in this deck. It is composed of x1 Chaos Space, x2 Levianeer, x1 Diabolos, x1 Chaos Emperor, x1 Dragon of Armageddon, x1 Seyfert, x1 Wyverburster and x1 Collapserpent. These cards provide extra bodies on board by banishing light/dark cards in the GY. By banishing Thunder Dragons, they trigger their effects.

Consistency boosters in this deck are x3 Allure of Darkness (its banish effect triggers Thunder Dragon monsters), x1 Chaos Space and x1 Gold Sarcophagus. 3 Imperm is used as a generic interruption. Forbidden Droplet are used at x3 since this deck cannot use a critical mass of handtraps and instead uses boardbreakers and a lot of plays to get its gameplan going.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong>&nbsp;with this deck is simple &ndash; lockdown the board going first with double Colossus, and OTK going second.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;If the duel is forced into a grind-game, the Thunder Dragon/Bystial/Chaos resource loop and the previous turn's graveyard set-up can whittle an opponent down.&nbsp;Thunder Dragon Fusion can also be banished the turn after you use it to allow you to search for Thunder Dragonroar, which can be discarded to recover Thunder Dragon Fusion from the banished pile.

The board might be even so far advanced that the opponent may straight up surrender, since the boards that deck deploys turn one are almost an FTK with the floodgate and interruption present.&nbsp;The win condition of Thunder Dragon is summoning its signature&nbsp;boss monster Thunder Dragon Colossus. Everything else is designed to allow the player to ""get there,"" and ""protect the castle"" (in this case the castle is Colossus).</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, boards are easily picked apart by your giant beatsticks, Bystials, Levianeer's pops, and Accesscode's multiple pops. After breaking an opponent&rsquo;s board, this deck can combo easily to generate enough gigantic monsters onboard to obliterate your opponent&rsquo;s lifepoints in one turn. The many staples this deck can utilize (additional handtraps/boardbreakers can be sided in) should also simplify your opponent's gamestate to the point where your in-engine cards can use their natural boardbreaking potential.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here is the main <strong>COMBO </strong>for Thunder Dragon Bystial:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Any Bystial + Batteryman Solar </em>= Colossus (No Searching) + Chaos Angel (Battle immunity) + S:P Little Knight (Banish).&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><ol style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1019""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal summon Batteryman Solar.

Outgrind everything,"<p>This is my take on a Runick Magical Musket decklist (as an attempt to look for more ""fun"" alternatives to pure Runick Stun) with the ability to pivot into (or from, up to you) a light floodgate strategy (side out Droplet, Dispelling, Smiting Storm, 2 Link into the VRAINS and one other card for your continuous traps in your side deck)</p><p>Otherwise I decided to main deck Super Poly since it is basically the strongest disruption in the game that you can run.</p><p>As for the Link into the VRAINS rules: If you can resolve this card it seriously ROCKS. There is about a 10% probability of opening it with another Musker Monster but when you do, your Max effect to respond to an established board will literally not be negateable unless your opponent flips skill drain in response to your spell actvation (might be smart to side this for game 2 with DRNM and Evenly instead tbh since DRNM ensures it will go off)</p><p>Otherwise the deck will attempt to simplify the gamestate until you can confortably outgrind your opponent and believe me, from turn 3 onwards your hand rarely stays empty (you might even have to constantly discard Runick Spells because your hand is too stacked which in turn enables larger draws from Fountain during the opponent's turn)</p><p>Hope y'all like the list</p>"

Danger + Meiru,"<p>Hello! This is a hostage deck, where your opponent is welcome to commit the suicide. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuGGwspa5t4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, either Link Summon Saryuja or use Offerings to clear 3 x Main Monster Zone (MMZ) for Trishula.</p><p>2) In order to Synchro Summon Trishula, revive Ancient + Level 1 Non-Tuner + Level 1 Tuner with ""Monster Reborn"". Repeat Trishula with ""De-Synchro"" to get rid of whatever your opponent has in hand + field + GY and send them all to BZ.</p><p>3) Give your opponent 2 x Danger cards with ""Gold Moon Coin"" and bring forth Meiru. Next, revive two monsters and set their levels to 7 with ""Star Changer"". For example, Ancient + Trishula (7) = Flare Metal is the equation.</p><p>4) Have Kozaky in your hand. The easiest way is to banish from GY before Special Summoning Chaos Emperor Dragon and adding to your hand with ""Primal Seed"" but you can find it however you want. Afterwards, have Baronne and Fissure for safety. Then, set Drop Off + Primal Seed and end your turn.</p><p>5) Before letting your opponent begin, reveal Kozaky in-hand at first to not let Meiru detonate by accident. This was needed because you don't want to lose Kozaky in your hand due to ""Into the Void"".</p><p>6) When it's your opponent's turn, at Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"" to get rid of whatever your opponent has to BZ. Counter with Baronne if needed.</p><p>7) So, here is what's going on: Meiru can't let Danger cards come out while Flare Metal burns your opponent, if your opponent triggers either Dogman or Thunderbird. Since they are Level 5 or higher monsters and your opponent has nothing on their side, they can't Tribute Summon Danger cards. As a safety measure, in Master Duel, each individual card not having hard once per turn ability are hard-coded to proc up to 10 times in a single turn. Therefore, your opponent can willingly deal 20 x 500 = 10000 damage in total to themselves and end their misery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Koa'ki Meiru Doom"" can be found within ""Iron Core Synthetics"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"" can be found within ""The Cerise in the Ebony"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" can be found within ""Glacial Seal"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! You can also find it within ""Wings of the Guardian"" Timed Pack, while you still can!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Synchro Creed"" can be found within ""The Masters Saga"" Tımed Pack to save 30 SR! Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

(really don't know which archetype to lead with tbh)&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br />Okay so, I've had this deck in the back of my head ever since I saw Voiceless Voice in action.&nbsp;<br /><br />For starters, and the most obvious, Voiceless Voice Ritual Monsters all require a Level 7 Tribute. <br />Gate Guardian <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>pieces</em></span> are all Level 7s. We're giving the Gate Garnets a purpose, aren't we nice?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>***This deck is going through playtesting so this build might be subject to change***</strong><br /><br />-<br /><br />As far as the strategy goes, here's what I've cooked up so far:&nbsp;<br /><br />Your ideal board is going to be <strong>Lo</strong>, <strong>Skull Guardian</strong> and <strong>Gate Guardian Combined</strong> with a <strong>Sauravis</strong> in-hand. Bonus points if you have handtraps, but really... you should be fine either way.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's not to say you can't keep going from there, but this deck can be very... very fragile if you overextend.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are starting out with&nbsp;<strong>Lo&nbsp;</strong>in-hand alongside some <strong>GG</strong> starters, lead with the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>line as it really does not matter in the slightest if they get negated in any capacity.&nbsp;<br /><br />From there, Normal Summon <strong>Lo&nbsp;</strong>and go through that line.&nbsp;<br /><br />Keep in mind, the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>Spell Cards (excluding the Field Spell) all search&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>pieces once sent to the GY (<em>and on the same turn if you'd like</em>) to the point where you could <strong>Grass</strong> half the deck and probably come out with <strong>Combined&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Wind and Water</strong> on Turn 1.&nbsp;<br /><br />There will never not be a piece in your hand or on the field so long as you have any of the cards at your disposal.<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, there are a ton of cards in here that do not make sense, so I'll go over them and their specific uses before I get crucified by the community:&nbsp;<br /><br />Starting with <strong>[Legacy of the Duelist]:</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you like cheating in games? Do you never want to deck out no matter how long the duel has gone? Do you want to annoy Trap Deck players?&nbsp;<br /><br />Then THIS CARD&nbsp;<em>*might* </em>be for you! <br /><br />Not only does it act as a pseudo&nbsp;<strong>[Swords of Revealing Light]</strong> for Extra Deck monsters on the turn they're summoned, BUT both players can only <em>Set </em>1 Spell or Trap card a turn, period. In addition to that, you can negate your own attack with any monster to destroy one of their Spells or Traps (Set or Face-Up) during Battle ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND you can forego your draw for turn to add a card from the GY to hand! <br /><br />All for the cost of LITERALLY NOTHING (other than running the risk of getting it destroyed the next turn, but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE.)&nbsp;<br /><br />All this to say that it covers a lot of what the deck suffers from, surprisingly enough. You can shoot yourself in the foot if you're not being mindful of <em>when&nbsp;</em>you play it.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[Summon Limit]&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Jokes on you, this deck is actually a floodgate deck! /j<br /><br />But really,&nbsp;<strong>Limit&nbsp;</strong>works beautifully here considering the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>line isn't crying about limited Special Summons.

I was not expecting these cards to come out anytime soon. I thought maybe like a few more years later, but now it&rsquo;s honestly amazing. Thank You Konami for making them real, not just for me, but for others as well. I also wanna mention that my new video for this DeckList is taking a lot longer due to DuelingNexus still fixing a bug with one of the new cards, which has unfortunately delayed my upload for it so I do apologize for the wait &amp; I also saw someone use my old DeckList even though the new support is out lol. I really wanted to wait until I uploaded the video on my channel first before publishing this, but I&rsquo;ve now made the decision to just put it up here for everyone (The video will come out as soon as the card gets fixed, so I hope you guys enjoy it). If there&rsquo;s any changes I make to the Deck I&rsquo;ll be updating it here, so be sure to check up on it once in a while to be up to date.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-c0c5dd09-7fff-6478-6e93-34addfe878e7"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Anyways onto the Deck description! The Clear archetype (from the Anime, used by Yusuke Fujiwara) Deck concept is about crippling the opponent with &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo; depending on which Attributed monster they control on the field, also having cards to change the monster's attributes. Clear monsters on the other hand let you bypass all the detrimental effects leaving the opponent to suffer all the negative effects. As I stated previously there were only 2 &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; Cards at the time, but now they&rsquo;re an official Archetype (many more support cards to come in near future). With so many new cards coming out, there&rsquo;ll be many different variations to play with this deck so play with what fits best with your play style.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">With this DeckList we&rsquo;ll be using good ol Shaddolls, although this time there'll be a very drastic change, they&rsquo;ll be a smaller package in our deck than before. Your main Focus now is crippling your opponent by Setting up your Field Spell &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo;, Continuous Spell &ldquo;Clear Wall&rdquo;, &amp; Beat down by Tribute Summoning &ldquo;Clear Vicious Knight&rdquo; your New Boss monster of the deck. These cards with its devastating combo will make your opponent deal with our Field Spell by Force even if they don&rsquo;t have the right Attributes or a monster Present on their field, it is just applied to them without starting any chains because of our Continuous Spell last effect which adds quite a bit of pressure to them. &ldquo;Clear Wall&rdquo; also gives us &amp; our Clear monster battling protection, we also don&rsquo;t take the damage that involves them in their upcoming fights.</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&ldquo;Clear Vicious Knight&rdquo; provides excellent field presence with all of its effects being Continuous like giving us immunity to &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s summoning condition, its ATK boost &amp; its Floodgate effect on field against Special Summoned Monster which will restrict them (This even turns off Unaffected Monsters like &ldquo;Raidraptor - Rising Rebellion Falcon&rdquo; which is dope), but not without its own flaws keeping it in check; This monster has no protection effects of any sorts against Spell &amp; Trap cards, Monster in the Hand, Graveyard, or that were Normal Summon can bypass its Floodgate &amp; the ATK boost is only the Original ATK of the monster, so any monster that have a stat of ?

Cube also has a floating effect that it can Special Summon any Clear Monster which is nice for defense (it has to be Face-Up which is kinda a bummer), but also it can be used for offense to ATK for game by SS into; Golem, Knight (although it won&rsquo;t get its floodgate effect), or Dragon. If they were to stop your play by &ldquo;Infinite Impermanence&rdquo; the little guy you can just battle into their monster taking some Dmg SS another Cube then proceed where you left off by Tribute Summoning CVK, but this can also get blocked if Wall is up too.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">If you liked the Deck Profile, Please leave a Like &amp; Comment.

Next, activate all three Nightmares and use ""Mystic Box"" to replace the flower with Flare.</p><p>3) Activate anything to reflect the incoming damage from Flare right back at your opponent with Lantron. Since every damage your opponent took triggers Nightmare, that means Flare has to trigger as well.

It had cute girls and mecha, which is like a match made in heaven for me, and it was the most immediately powerful of the archetypes in that pack (compared to the mediocre starting states of Memento and Vaalmonica, even if both decks now have much better support). In Master Duel, it's...</p><p>Very playable! Like, it's in the Tier 2-3 bubble where it's clearly not as powerful as Snake-Eye/Yubel, but it's very capable of contending with the best and winning games with reasonable consistency. A lot of consistency, no less, since we run 12 one-card starters (Primera, Trudea, Emblema, Stand Up). It's very easy to make the deck get going, and once you get going you have a lot of grind that's hard to bust through.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1i8qq1hmm3"">Centur-Ion Engine</h2><ul><li>Primera is our archetypal Stratos, searching out anything that isn't another copy of herself (or Emblema Oath since it's our out-of-archetype-by-name search spell) and also our Tuner by which to Synchro with. Also protects our Level 5+ Centur-Ion monsters from destruction by effect, which can be really funny when your opponent decides to discard their entire hand trying to blow up Auxila with Jowgen (literally happened to me in the Duelist Cup, they spent 4 cards on trying to out Auxila that way), but otherwise mostly just translates to making boards harder to bust before you do an Accel Synchro. Run 3.</li><li>Trudea is Primera's partner in the lore, and allows easy access to Primera in scenarios where you don't draw her (and lets you get into Gargoyle II if you aren't under Maxx 'C' or aren't concerned about Nibiru). Very painful when she gets Imperm'd, but otherwise she's another playmaker. Once again, run 3 copies.</li><li>Stand-Up Centur-Ion! is our archetypal field spell that does basically everything. It gets you into full combo if you didn't open Primera/Trudea (for the cost of a discard, which cannot be performed under Shifter as an aside), and gives you the ability to Synchro on your opponent's turn. For the third time, you run 3 copies. Also Primera's doing the ever-goated Gunbuster pose in the art, because this archetype is peak.</li><li>Emblema Oath is that aforementioned not in the archetype by name searcher (like Stake Your Soul or Nadir Servant), which either puts a Centur-Ion monster in your zone as a Trap (which can be summoned immediately) or sets a Centur-Ion Spell/Trap (normal S/T rules apply there). Yet again, you're running 3 copies, this also represents full combo.</li><li>Gargoyle II is the Level 8 I usually try to snag if I can, as it adds itself back to hand after being used for Synchro material. Every card that isn't a 1 card starter, this one included, is probably best run at 1 copy. You want to minimize the amount of bricks since this deck 'only' has 12 direct starters, and most of the cards here don't need multiples to be useful.</li><li>Emeth VI is a second level 8, mostly just a safe discard fodder that can help you dodge some stuff and get another 8 on the field. Perfectly cuttable, I'm debating axing it myself.</li><li>Bonds is an extender/recovery tool, allowing you to fix awkward scenarios where something leaves the field or the wrong thing gets Imperm'd.</li><li>Wake Up Centur-Ion! is another extender, a way to Synchro with Primera if you can't get an 8 on the field in some other way, and even Foolish Burials a Centur-Ion card afterward by banishing itself from the GY.</li><li>Phalanx is our primary end-board trap, banishing a card until the next Standby Phase. Notably, the nature of it does trigger SS effects (like our Synchros and Primera) and prevents cards like Phantom of Yubel from coming back. It also revives a Centur-Ion monster (including our Synchros) by banishing itself from the GY. I run 1 copy, but there is an argument for 2 I feel.</li><li>True Awakening is an omni-negate Counter Trap with the requirement of sending a face-up monster in your S/T zone to the GY. It's not quite as powerful as it sounds, as it requires relatively specific hands to get an extra monster in the S/T zone (and oftentimes conflicts with whichever supplementary engines you're running since they often use other Continuous Spell/Traps), but when it works it works very well. I run 1 copy, but it is entirely cuttable.</li><li>Auxila is our most important Synchro, and your thing to make turn 1 no matter what. It searches a Centur-Ion card on Special Summon and protects your face-up Spell/Traps (including any non-Centur-Ion ones you might be running, whether they're stun floodgates or King's Sarc or Branded Regained) from all card effects your opponent throws at it. and in the End Phase, it puts a Centur-Ion from GY/banishment in your S/T zone as a Continuous Trap. I run 2, but there's argument for pretty much any quantity of it.</li><li>Legatia is the original boss monster, and still an important card for busting through your opponent's monsters. It draws 1 on summon and then lets you destroy the monster your opponent controls with the highest ATK. It also has a similar effect to Auxila, though only from hand or GY. I run 1 copy, but you can run more if you've got the space.</li></ul><p>With all the Centur-Ion engine complete, that only accounts for 18 cards in the main deck. That's not enough on its own to make a deck. There's a decent number of options for filling out the deck, the most common as far supplementary engines go being either Horus or Bystial. Horus gives you access to the Rank 8 XYZ pool and makes it easier to get into the Centur-Ion part of your deck, Bystial has the potent grind from Regained+Beast and the Level 10 Synchro pool. Feel free to experiment. I run a large Horus engine for the purpose, since it allows access to Giantrainer to dig through the deck.</p><p>The rest of the deck is comprised of hand-traps and 3x Evenly Matched, pretty simple stuff. Pick and choose what you like, there's not really a defined ""best"" choice for non-engine because it's defined by the meta and not the deck itself.</p><p>As for the Extra Deck, while we lack Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, Crimson Dragon is still an extremely potent card and my usual pick for what I make on my opponent's turn. Quasar is an omni-negate that is a pain to out, and Supernova is a board-wipe that can basically ruin your opponent's day if you time it right.&nbsp;</p><p>Rank 8 XYZ priority is usually Photon Lord &gt; Hope Harbinger going first, as monster effects usually tend to be more problematic than Spells, but use your discretion and think about the format you're in and which one would be more useful going up against the best decks. Giantrainer should only be used if you need to dig, and remember that it doesn't work if you go to the Battle Phase for any reason (usually Evenly Matched). And Dingirsu is just another board-breaker, because every drop of board-busting is valuable in a format like Master Duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

What I mean by that is that this deck uses speedroids to synchro summon so the synchro monsters can technically be changed out. However, it runs best when it has at most 5 speedroid monsters in the extra deck. It can compete in the meta but isn't meta itself. It's a fun non meta deck and encourages fast plays and quick synchro summons. The keys to this deck are its ability to utilize the graveyard. Each of its synchro monsters are meant for various situations and aren't meant to be summoned willy nilly. It may still need a few more tweaks later down the line but I'll be doing that in master duel.&nbsp;</p>"

Inside the paleozoics engine there is a smaller engine from ""mystic tomato"" to ""sangan"" to either ""scapegoat"" (if you already have in your hand an Egyptian god) or ""deep diver"" (to have access to an Egyptian god).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The gameplay should be kind of slow (20 turns), to prepare your board for the summoning of an Egyptian god and OTK in that turn. You don't only need to have 3 monsters for tribute, but you should create an advantage by destroying all enemy disruptions or floodgates and then with the help of ""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"" to attack to a monsters with 0 ATK points with your God and win.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe Slifer is the best of these 3 in the deck, cause of it's floodgate effect and cause the paleozoic engine has ""Paleozoic Pikaia"" (draw 2) that is searchable via ""Paleozoic Opabinia"".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cards like ""Lost wind"" or ""Breakthrough Skill"" are highly recommended while ""Spiritual swords of revealing light"" is a playable option too. You should really learn every single trick this deck has and always find the better answers of -HOW TO OUT- an annoying card. This deck has a lot of potential and there is no need to Mill your deck. An other way of summoning or searching for a God could be by using ""Mound of the bound creator"" and destroy it. But I feel it's less consistent than monster cards, cause monster cards are important too in such a heavy oriented trap deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's not a secret that having all 3 Gods in one deck, is not a good idea. But Paleozoics and maybe DarkMagicians archetypes are the only 2 decks that can somehow use them. Every Egyptian God has some advantages and disadvantages... That's why it's better to use 1 of them in a deck, that's built around it. I don't recommend you to play this one, but it's not impossible to beat even strong enemies like Odion and Vetrix for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paleozoics reminds me of the cards ""Metal Reflect Slime"" (cause it's a trap) and ""Egyptian God slime"", that has same attribute and type. In the anime ""Attack on Titan"" a Paleozoic creature called ""Source of all living matter"" is responsible for giving God-like powers to others life sources and is the oldest living source in this world. You can think of it as true God, so that's how it matches with the Egyptian God archetype.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I run 24 Paleozoics cards is simple.

Es un mazazo y todavia gana m&aacute;s que nada por que el 90% de la gente no sabe como reventar el Empen o bien les cuesta y gastan recursos. No es para nada todo lo roto que estaba antes, por que antes era un mazo degenerado <em>(Hablamos de tiempo donde estaba legal Wind Statue)</em> donde LITERALMENTE no te dejaba jugar. Una handtrap bien puesta y te mata, pero es si no de, mi mazo favorito para jugar. Juego tres Stri por que despues de mucha iteracion mental, el banishear una carta de un Cementerio es un efecto que no solo SIEMPRE vas a poder activar, si no que es uno util para sacarle value al oponente como para en primer turno banishearte tu propio Cementerio y reutilizar la Shifter. Y juego tres Empen por que me gusta. Yo dentro de lo malo que esta, sigo sintiendolo competitivo, que se yo.</p><p>Para m&aacute;s sentimiento, con este mazo fui a mi primer torneo regional <em>(Buenos Aires 2024)</em> y le tengo cari&ntilde;o tambien por eso.&nbsp;</p>"
