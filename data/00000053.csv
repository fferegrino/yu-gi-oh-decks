Yubel remains the best way to play Branded, and its powerups is an indirect buff to Albaz and friends. In addition to the regular playstyle of Branded, Yubel can now be used as a monster negate engine - effectively granting the deck an extra 3 copies of Called by the Grave. The Yubel cards are fairly minimal and it is composed of 5 cards. It is comprised of 3 Nightmare Throne, 1 Spirit of Yubel and 1 OG Yubel. Upon activation, Nightmare Throne destroys in deck Spirit of Yubel, which floats into the OG Yubel from deck. From there, a Phantom of Yubel can be summoned, granting Branded another way to deal with handtraps like Ash Blossom! Phantom of Yubel grants a higher success rate for Branded Fusion to successfully resolve - thus winning you more games!&nbsp;<br /><br />Yubel can also break boards and bait handtraps, since most gamestates are monster interaction based nowadays, the opposing player will be forced to prematurely use their interruption in an effort to stop Phantom of Yubel from coming out! After Yubel has sufficiently used up your opponent's interruption, you can go for your regular Branded plays unimpeded, without fear of Ash Blossom or Nibiru!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The Yubel cards also aren't really ""bricks"" since they can be discarded to the GY as part of your Branded combos. If you happen to have both Yubels in the GY (through Branded Fusion, Grass Grows Greener, etc.) you can also make Phantom of Yubel relatively free!&nbsp;<br /><br />While not entirely game changing and it doesn't largely change the strategy, the ""Yubel engine"" grants another layer of protection of Branded.

This isn&rsquo;t just a card; it&rsquo;s the embodiment of divine power, summoned by the legendary trio: Slifer the Sky Dragon, Obelisk the Tormentor, and The Winged Dragon of Ra.</p><p>😱 Now, imagine the tension rising as you finally gather the three Egyptian Gods on your field. The moment you tribute them to summon Holactie, your heart races! This card&rsquo;s summon cannot be negated. No tricks, no traps&mdash;just pure, unadulterated power. And let&rsquo;s be real: the look on your opponent&rsquo;s face when they realize they&rsquo;ve just lost is priceless!</p><p>🌌 Let&rsquo;s talk about our trio of divine monsters. Obelisk the Tormentor is a force to be reckoned with. His ability to wipe out your opponent&rsquo;s monsters is like a thunderstorm clearing the skies. But beware!

(I just went with stardust warrior because barrone is banned but it used to be barrone) Ultra Polymerization is fantastic for both summoning first of the dragons and bringing our lord and savior back to the field to use for a&nbsp; gachi gachi to crash and protecc itself so you can summon zeus. Fun fact: first of the dragons is unaffected by zeus so it can survive the nuke. the instant fusion is used for the level 2 allvain which is just amazing for either synchro, xyz or link plays. One of your dragons get banished? bring that dude back with the guarddragon pisty! dont know what to do with 2 petit dragons? make a spheres and get the third one out of the deck! Afraid of ash?

To do this, I expect you would need a lot of card advantage so therefor I use pot of desires and pikaia. I have not tried the deck yet, but I will shortly. Any advise on what to change, without changing the whole premise of the deck is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>"

Let's burn it up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/euFHIl-96QU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Discard Enchanter + Parasite to GY with Ravenous. Next, when you have four monsters and nothing more, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Black Luster Soldier with its ability but don't banish Ancient and Level 1 DARK monsters by accident. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>2) Use ""Monster Reborn"" to revive Ancient alongside two more monsters but reserve 2 x Level 1 monsters for future use. Next, play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" and target on Ancient, setting the level of your monsters to 7. Then, XYZ Summon Arise-Heart with these three, right behind any Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) to your preference.</p><p>3) Revive a monster and Link Summon Reprodocus with it and Saryuja, above where Arise-Heart is. Next, revive Enchanter. Then, bring forth 2 x Level 1 monsters excluding Parasite and XYZ Summon Promenade...</p><ul><li>If you have noticed, playing ""Primal Seed"" feeds Arise-Heart and we can progress even further with Enchanter. So long as you don't discard Sanctuary + Reborn by accident besides ""Primal Seed"" with Enchanter, which are your combo pieces, all is well.</li></ul><p>4) When Arise-Heart has 20 or more materials, activate Reprodocus to change the&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>of Arise-Heart to&nbsp;<strong>Winged Beast.</strong> Next, play Sanctuary and attach Arise-Heart into Promenade.</p><p>5) Finally, revive Parasite and Fusion Summon Nightingale by using Parasite + Promenade as materials. Raise the level of Nightingale and launch some fireworks for your glorious victory!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"" + ""Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Kashtira Arise-Heart"" can be found within ""A Warrior of Seething Anger"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Not to mention its capacity to interact with every single turn that is played, slowly shifting the power back to yourself when your turn comes around. At the same time as this however, this deck list has the incrediable capacity to just end simple, play slow and wait on traps, you can summon a melffy catty, set 3 and hold some cards like maxx c or swift scarecrow, allowing you to take your time developing into something more powerful as everyone tears eachother to shredds. In doing this however you do run the risk of getting OTK'd, as without the right opening hand, you will not be able to just hold onto your cards. This is why I have chosen rescue cat as my DM, Rescue cat has the amazing ability to get you litterally anything you need. Most games I found myself fully commiting to the first turn play, having to wall up with a melffy wally and a few defensive cards. Summoning kerass and ojama pink from deck off Cat to make Melffy of the Forest, searching out wally who will summon pony and puppy. Pony would bring back Kerass for turn 2 and puppy would summon any melffy needed for the situation. It is a versitile consistently annoying midrange deck with some funny little options like: the one polly for a 2 card off rescue cat Koalo-Koala, pinpoint landing providing draw power, grave of the super ancient organism stumping most decks and Nat beast turn one with a full hand of melffy's and a red reboot.<br /><br />As for end goals of the deck, there is very few possibilities. You either punch in with big extra-deck bodies, or sit on looping melffies and Ronin Racoon until everyone kills eachother.</p>"

For example, the Bystial package allows Thunder Dragon to enter recycle cards, maintain card advantage, provide massive level 6/8 bodies on board, and apply pressure with various removal effects as well as with high 2500 ATK. Bystials also banish both light/dark monsters from the GY, allowing Thunder Dragon monsters to trigger their effects even during your opponent's turn. The Zombie Vampire, easily accessible due to the rank 8s in this deck can mill and summon monsters from either GY for more plays! S:P Little Knight banishes your GY your Thunder Dragon monsters, triggering their effects!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Colossus and friends have certainly come back with a vengeance with the September 2024 banlist, this time with new powerful friends!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The original Thunder Dragon and Thunder Dragonmatrix are cut to fit the other supporting archetypes in the deck. Only 3 Dragondark, 2 Dragonhawk and 2 Dragonroar are used. 3 Batteryman Solar is the best normal summon the deck has, since it simultaneously sends to GY a Thunder Dragon on summon (setting up to be banished to trigger their effects) and generates a token so that it can be linked away for Cross-Sheep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>BYSTIAL </strong>cards compose a large chunk of cards in this deck, functioning simultaneously as combo pieces (to banish Thunder Dragon cards), interruption (banish handtraps + removal), and grindgame (Branded Regained). 2 Lubellion and 2 Saronir allow for Branded Regained to set up. 1 Magnumhut, 1 Baldrake and 2 Druiswyrm round out the Bystial monsters. Finally, 1 Branded Regained is used since it is highly searchable. With Bystial cards enabling banishment from the GY and the Thunder Dragon's effects triggering when getting banished, it seems like these two archetypes were made for each other! They support each other's weakpoints and enable each of their effects. 2 Assault Synchron are used since it allows easy access to Genex Return Zero, Bystial Dis Pater and Chaos Angel. Assault Synchron can also summon Dis Pater from the GY/banished if it is tributed or banished, especially by Lubellion's effect.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A sizeable <strong>CHAOS </strong>engine is also used in this deck. It is composed of x1 Chaos Space, x2 Levianeer, x1 Diabolos, x1 Chaos Emperor, x1 Dragon of Armageddon, x1 Seyfert, x1 Wyverburster and x1 Collapserpent. These cards provide extra bodies on board by banishing light/dark cards in the GY. By banishing Thunder Dragons, they trigger their effects.

Consistency boosters in this deck are x3 Allure of Darkness (its banish effect triggers Thunder Dragon monsters), x1 Chaos Space and x1 Gold Sarcophagus. 3 Imperm is used as a generic interruption. Forbidden Droplet are used at x3 since this deck cannot use a critical mass of handtraps and instead uses boardbreakers and a lot of plays to get its gameplan going.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>GAMEPLAN</strong>&nbsp;with this deck is simple &ndash; lockdown the board going first with double Colossus, and OTK going second.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;If the duel is forced into a grind-game, the Thunder Dragon/Bystial/Chaos resource loop and the previous turn's graveyard set-up can whittle an opponent down.&nbsp;Thunder Dragon Fusion can also be banished the turn after you use it to allow you to search for Thunder Dragonroar, which can be discarded to recover Thunder Dragon Fusion from the banished pile.

The board might be even so far advanced that the opponent may straight up surrender, since the boards that deck deploys turn one are almost an FTK with the floodgate and interruption present.&nbsp;The win condition of Thunder Dragon is summoning its signature&nbsp;boss monster Thunder Dragon Colossus. Everything else is designed to allow the player to ""get there,"" and ""protect the castle"" (in this case the castle is Colossus).</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, boards are easily picked apart by your giant beatsticks, Bystials, Levianeer's pops, and Accesscode's multiple pops. After breaking an opponent&rsquo;s board, this deck can combo easily to generate enough gigantic monsters onboard to obliterate your opponent&rsquo;s lifepoints in one turn. The many staples this deck can utilize (additional handtraps/boardbreakers can be sided in) should also simplify your opponent's gamestate to the point where your in-engine cards can use their natural boardbreaking potential.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here is the main <strong>COMBO </strong>for Thunder Dragon Bystial:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Any Bystial + Batteryman Solar </em>= Colossus (No Searching) + Chaos Angel (Battle immunity) + S:P Little Knight (Banish).&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><ol style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1019""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal summon Batteryman Solar.

Outgrind everything,"<p>This is my take on a Runick Magical Musket decklist (as an attempt to look for more ""fun"" alternatives to pure Runick Stun) with the ability to pivot into (or from, up to you) a light floodgate strategy (side out Droplet, Dispelling, Smiting Storm, 2 Link into the VRAINS and one other card for your continuous traps in your side deck)</p><p>Otherwise I decided to main deck Super Poly since it is basically the strongest disruption in the game that you can run.</p><p>As for the Link into the VRAINS rules: If you can resolve this card it seriously ROCKS. There is about a 10% probability of opening it with another Musker Monster but when you do, your Max effect to respond to an established board will literally not be negateable unless your opponent flips skill drain in response to your spell actvation (might be smart to side this for game 2 with DRNM and Evenly instead tbh since DRNM ensures it will go off)</p><p>Otherwise the deck will attempt to simplify the gamestate until you can confortably outgrind your opponent and believe me, from turn 3 onwards your hand rarely stays empty (you might even have to constantly discard Runick Spells because your hand is too stacked which in turn enables larger draws from Fountain during the opponent's turn)</p><p>Hope y'all like the list</p>"

Danger + Meiru,"<p>Hello! This is a hostage deck, where your opponent is welcome to commit the suicide. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuGGwspa5t4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, either Link Summon Saryuja or use Offerings to clear 3 x Main Monster Zone (MMZ) for Trishula.</p><p>2) In order to Synchro Summon Trishula, revive Ancient + Level 1 Non-Tuner + Level 1 Tuner with ""Monster Reborn"". Repeat Trishula with ""De-Synchro"" to get rid of whatever your opponent has in hand + field + GY and send them all to BZ.</p><p>3) Give your opponent 2 x Danger cards with ""Gold Moon Coin"" and bring forth Meiru. Next, revive two monsters and set their levels to 7 with ""Star Changer"". For example, Ancient + Trishula (7) = Flare Metal is the equation.</p><p>4) Have Kozaky in your hand. The easiest way is to banish from GY before Special Summoning Chaos Emperor Dragon and adding to your hand with ""Primal Seed"" but you can find it however you want. Afterwards, have Baronne and Fissure for safety. Then, set Drop Off + Primal Seed and end your turn.</p><p>5) Before letting your opponent begin, reveal Kozaky in-hand at first to not let Meiru detonate by accident. This was needed because you don't want to lose Kozaky in your hand due to ""Into the Void"".</p><p>6) When it's your opponent's turn, at Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"" to get rid of whatever your opponent has to BZ. Counter with Baronne if needed.</p><p>7) So, here is what's going on: Meiru can't let Danger cards come out while Flare Metal burns your opponent, if your opponent triggers either Dogman or Thunderbird. Since they are Level 5 or higher monsters and your opponent has nothing on their side, they can't Tribute Summon Danger cards. As a safety measure, in Master Duel, each individual card not having hard once per turn ability are hard-coded to proc up to 10 times in a single turn. Therefore, your opponent can willingly deal 20 x 500 = 10000 damage in total to themselves and end their misery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Koa'ki Meiru Doom"" can be found within ""Iron Core Synthetics"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"" can be found within ""The Cerise in the Ebony"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" can be found within ""Glacial Seal"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! You can also find it within ""Wings of the Guardian"" Timed Pack, while you still can!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Synchro Creed"" can be found within ""The Masters Saga"" Tımed Pack to save 30 SR! Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

(really don't know which archetype to lead with tbh)&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br />Okay so, I've had this deck in the back of my head ever since I saw Voiceless Voice in action.&nbsp;<br /><br />For starters, and the most obvious, Voiceless Voice Ritual Monsters all require a Level 7 Tribute. <br />Gate Guardian <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>pieces</em></span> are all Level 7s. We're giving the Gate Garnets a purpose, aren't we nice?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>***This deck is going through playtesting so this build might be subject to change***</strong><br /><br />-<br /><br />As far as the strategy goes, here's what I've cooked up so far:&nbsp;<br /><br />Your ideal board is going to be <strong>Lo</strong>, <strong>Skull Guardian</strong> and <strong>Gate Guardian Combined</strong> with a <strong>Sauravis</strong> in-hand. Bonus points if you have handtraps, but really... you should be fine either way.&nbsp;<br /><br />That's not to say you can't keep going from there, but this deck can be very... very fragile if you overextend.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are starting out with&nbsp;<strong>Lo&nbsp;</strong>in-hand alongside some <strong>GG</strong> starters, lead with the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>line as it really does not matter in the slightest if they get negated in any capacity.&nbsp;<br /><br />From there, Normal Summon <strong>Lo&nbsp;</strong>and go through that line.&nbsp;<br /><br />Keep in mind, the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>Spell Cards (excluding the Field Spell) all search&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>pieces once sent to the GY (<em>and on the same turn if you'd like</em>) to the point where you could <strong>Grass</strong> half the deck and probably come out with <strong>Combined&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Wind and Water</strong> on Turn 1.&nbsp;<br /><br />There will never not be a piece in your hand or on the field so long as you have any of the cards at your disposal.<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, there are a ton of cards in here that do not make sense, so I'll go over them and their specific uses before I get crucified by the community:&nbsp;<br /><br />Starting with <strong>[Legacy of the Duelist]:</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you like cheating in games? Do you never want to deck out no matter how long the duel has gone? Do you want to annoy Trap Deck players?&nbsp;<br /><br />Then THIS CARD&nbsp;<em>*might* </em>be for you! <br /><br />Not only does it act as a pseudo&nbsp;<strong>[Swords of Revealing Light]</strong> for Extra Deck monsters on the turn they're summoned, BUT both players can only <em>Set </em>1 Spell or Trap card a turn, period. In addition to that, you can negate your own attack with any monster to destroy one of their Spells or Traps (Set or Face-Up) during Battle ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND you can forego your draw for turn to add a card from the GY to hand! <br /><br />All for the cost of LITERALLY NOTHING (other than running the risk of getting it destroyed the next turn, but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE.)&nbsp;<br /><br />All this to say that it covers a lot of what the deck suffers from, surprisingly enough. You can shoot yourself in the foot if you're not being mindful of <em>when&nbsp;</em>you play it.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[Summon Limit]&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Jokes on you, this deck is actually a floodgate deck! /j<br /><br />But really,&nbsp;<strong>Limit&nbsp;</strong>works beautifully here considering the&nbsp;<strong>GG&nbsp;</strong>line isn't crying about limited Special Summons.

I was not expecting these cards to come out anytime soon. I thought maybe like a few more years later, but now it&rsquo;s honestly amazing. Thank You Konami for making them real, not just for me, but for others as well. I also wanna mention that my new video for this DeckList is taking a lot longer due to DuelingNexus still fixing a bug with one of the new cards, which has unfortunately delayed my upload for it so I do apologize for the wait &amp; I also saw someone use my old DeckList even though the new support is out lol. I really wanted to wait until I uploaded the video on my channel first before publishing this, but I&rsquo;ve now made the decision to just put it up here for everyone (The video will come out as soon as the card gets fixed, so I hope you guys enjoy it). If there&rsquo;s any changes I make to the Deck I&rsquo;ll be updating it here, so be sure to check up on it once in a while to be up to date.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-c0c5dd09-7fff-6478-6e93-34addfe878e7"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Anyways onto the Deck description! The Clear archetype (from the Anime, used by Yusuke Fujiwara) Deck concept is about crippling the opponent with &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo; depending on which Attributed monster they control on the field, also having cards to change the monster's attributes. Clear monsters on the other hand let you bypass all the detrimental effects leaving the opponent to suffer all the negative effects. As I stated previously there were only 2 &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; Cards at the time, but now they&rsquo;re an official Archetype (many more support cards to come in near future). With so many new cards coming out, there&rsquo;ll be many different variations to play with this deck so play with what fits best with your play style.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">With this DeckList we&rsquo;ll be using good ol Shaddolls, although this time there'll be a very drastic change, they&rsquo;ll be a smaller package in our deck than before. Your main Focus now is crippling your opponent by Setting up your Field Spell &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo;, Continuous Spell &ldquo;Clear Wall&rdquo;, &amp; Beat down by Tribute Summoning &ldquo;Clear Vicious Knight&rdquo; your New Boss monster of the deck. These cards with its devastating combo will make your opponent deal with our Field Spell by Force even if they don&rsquo;t have the right Attributes or a monster Present on their field, it is just applied to them without starting any chains because of our Continuous Spell last effect which adds quite a bit of pressure to them. &ldquo;Clear Wall&rdquo; also gives us &amp; our Clear monster battling protection, we also don&rsquo;t take the damage that involves them in their upcoming fights.</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&ldquo;Clear Vicious Knight&rdquo; provides excellent field presence with all of its effects being Continuous like giving us immunity to &ldquo;Clear World&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s summoning condition, its ATK boost &amp; its Floodgate effect on field against Special Summoned Monster which will restrict them (This even turns off Unaffected Monsters like &ldquo;Raidraptor - Rising Rebellion Falcon&rdquo; which is dope), but not without its own flaws keeping it in check; This monster has no protection effects of any sorts against Spell &amp; Trap cards, Monster in the Hand, Graveyard, or that were Normal Summon can bypass its Floodgate &amp; the ATK boost is only the Original ATK of the monster, so any monster that have a stat of ?

Cube also has a floating effect that it can Special Summon any Clear Monster which is nice for defense (it has to be Face-Up which is kinda a bummer), but also it can be used for offense to ATK for game by SS into; Golem, Knight (although it won&rsquo;t get its floodgate effect), or Dragon. If they were to stop your play by &ldquo;Infinite Impermanence&rdquo; the little guy you can just battle into their monster taking some Dmg SS another Cube then proceed where you left off by Tribute Summoning CVK, but this can also get blocked if Wall is up too.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">If you liked the Deck Profile, Please leave a Like &amp; Comment.

Next, activate all three Nightmares and use ""Mystic Box"" to replace the flower with Flare.</p><p>3) Activate anything to reflect the incoming damage from Flare right back at your opponent with Lantron. Since every damage your opponent took triggers Nightmare, that means Flare has to trigger as well.

It had cute girls and mecha, which is like a match made in heaven for me, and it was the most immediately powerful of the archetypes in that pack (compared to the mediocre starting states of Memento and Vaalmonica, even if both decks now have much better support). In Master Duel, it's...</p><p>Very playable! Like, it's in the Tier 2-3 bubble where it's clearly not as powerful as Snake-Eye/Yubel, but it's very capable of contending with the best and winning games with reasonable consistency. A lot of consistency, no less, since we run 12 one-card starters (Primera, Trudea, Emblema, Stand Up). It's very easy to make the deck get going, and once you get going you have a lot of grind that's hard to bust through.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1i8qq1hmm3"">Centur-Ion Engine</h2><ul><li>Primera is our archetypal Stratos, searching out anything that isn't another copy of herself (or Emblema Oath since it's our out-of-archetype-by-name search spell) and also our Tuner by which to Synchro with. Also protects our Level 5+ Centur-Ion monsters from destruction by effect, which can be really funny when your opponent decides to discard their entire hand trying to blow up Auxila with Jowgen (literally happened to me in the Duelist Cup, they spent 4 cards on trying to out Auxila that way), but otherwise mostly just translates to making boards harder to bust before you do an Accel Synchro. Run 3.</li><li>Trudea is Primera's partner in the lore, and allows easy access to Primera in scenarios where you don't draw her (and lets you get into Gargoyle II if you aren't under Maxx 'C' or aren't concerned about Nibiru). Very painful when she gets Imperm'd, but otherwise she's another playmaker. Once again, run 3 copies.</li><li>Stand-Up Centur-Ion! is our archetypal field spell that does basically everything. It gets you into full combo if you didn't open Primera/Trudea (for the cost of a discard, which cannot be performed under Shifter as an aside), and gives you the ability to Synchro on your opponent's turn. For the third time, you run 3 copies. Also Primera's doing the ever-goated Gunbuster pose in the art, because this archetype is peak.</li><li>Emblema Oath is that aforementioned not in the archetype by name searcher (like Stake Your Soul or Nadir Servant), which either puts a Centur-Ion monster in your zone as a Trap (which can be summoned immediately) or sets a Centur-Ion Spell/Trap (normal S/T rules apply there). Yet again, you're running 3 copies, this also represents full combo.</li><li>Gargoyle II is the Level 8 I usually try to snag if I can, as it adds itself back to hand after being used for Synchro material. Every card that isn't a 1 card starter, this one included, is probably best run at 1 copy. You want to minimize the amount of bricks since this deck 'only' has 12 direct starters, and most of the cards here don't need multiples to be useful.</li><li>Emeth VI is a second level 8, mostly just a safe discard fodder that can help you dodge some stuff and get another 8 on the field. Perfectly cuttable, I'm debating axing it myself.</li><li>Bonds is an extender/recovery tool, allowing you to fix awkward scenarios where something leaves the field or the wrong thing gets Imperm'd.</li><li>Wake Up Centur-Ion! is another extender, a way to Synchro with Primera if you can't get an 8 on the field in some other way, and even Foolish Burials a Centur-Ion card afterward by banishing itself from the GY.</li><li>Phalanx is our primary end-board trap, banishing a card until the next Standby Phase. Notably, the nature of it does trigger SS effects (like our Synchros and Primera) and prevents cards like Phantom of Yubel from coming back. It also revives a Centur-Ion monster (including our Synchros) by banishing itself from the GY. I run 1 copy, but there is an argument for 2 I feel.</li><li>True Awakening is an omni-negate Counter Trap with the requirement of sending a face-up monster in your S/T zone to the GY. It's not quite as powerful as it sounds, as it requires relatively specific hands to get an extra monster in the S/T zone (and oftentimes conflicts with whichever supplementary engines you're running since they often use other Continuous Spell/Traps), but when it works it works very well. I run 1 copy, but it is entirely cuttable.</li><li>Auxila is our most important Synchro, and your thing to make turn 1 no matter what. It searches a Centur-Ion card on Special Summon and protects your face-up Spell/Traps (including any non-Centur-Ion ones you might be running, whether they're stun floodgates or King's Sarc or Branded Regained) from all card effects your opponent throws at it. and in the End Phase, it puts a Centur-Ion from GY/banishment in your S/T zone as a Continuous Trap. I run 2, but there's argument for pretty much any quantity of it.</li><li>Legatia is the original boss monster, and still an important card for busting through your opponent's monsters. It draws 1 on summon and then lets you destroy the monster your opponent controls with the highest ATK. It also has a similar effect to Auxila, though only from hand or GY. I run 1 copy, but you can run more if you've got the space.</li></ul><p>With all the Centur-Ion engine complete, that only accounts for 18 cards in the main deck. That's not enough on its own to make a deck. There's a decent number of options for filling out the deck, the most common as far supplementary engines go being either Horus or Bystial. Horus gives you access to the Rank 8 XYZ pool and makes it easier to get into the Centur-Ion part of your deck, Bystial has the potent grind from Regained+Beast and the Level 10 Synchro pool. Feel free to experiment. I run a large Horus engine for the purpose, since it allows access to Giantrainer to dig through the deck.</p><p>The rest of the deck is comprised of hand-traps and 3x Evenly Matched, pretty simple stuff. Pick and choose what you like, there's not really a defined ""best"" choice for non-engine because it's defined by the meta and not the deck itself.</p><p>As for the Extra Deck, while we lack Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, Crimson Dragon is still an extremely potent card and my usual pick for what I make on my opponent's turn. Quasar is an omni-negate that is a pain to out, and Supernova is a board-wipe that can basically ruin your opponent's day if you time it right.&nbsp;</p><p>Rank 8 XYZ priority is usually Photon Lord &gt; Hope Harbinger going first, as monster effects usually tend to be more problematic than Spells, but use your discretion and think about the format you're in and which one would be more useful going up against the best decks. Giantrainer should only be used if you need to dig, and remember that it doesn't work if you go to the Battle Phase for any reason (usually Evenly Matched). And Dingirsu is just another board-breaker, because every drop of board-busting is valuable in a format like Master Duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

What I mean by that is that this deck uses speedroids to synchro summon so the synchro monsters can technically be changed out. However, it runs best when it has at most 5 speedroid monsters in the extra deck. It can compete in the meta but isn't meta itself. It's a fun non meta deck and encourages fast plays and quick synchro summons. The keys to this deck are its ability to utilize the graveyard. Each of its synchro monsters are meant for various situations and aren't meant to be summoned willy nilly. It may still need a few more tweaks later down the line but I'll be doing that in master duel.&nbsp;</p>"

Inside the paleozoics engine there is a smaller engine from ""mystic tomato"" to ""sangan"" to either ""scapegoat"" (if you already have in your hand an Egyptian god) or ""deep diver"" (to have access to an Egyptian god).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The gameplay should be kind of slow (20 turns), to prepare your board for the summoning of an Egyptian god and OTK in that turn. You don't only need to have 3 monsters for tribute, but you should create an advantage by destroying all enemy disruptions or floodgates and then with the help of ""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"" to attack to a monsters with 0 ATK points with your God and win.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe Slifer is the best of these 3 in the deck, cause of it's floodgate effect and cause the paleozoic engine has ""Paleozoic Pikaia"" (draw 2) that is searchable via ""Paleozoic Opabinia"".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cards like ""Lost wind"" or ""Breakthrough Skill"" are highly recommended while ""Spiritual swords of revealing light"" is a playable option too. You should really learn every single trick this deck has and always find the better answers of -HOW TO OUT- an annoying card. This deck has a lot of potential and there is no need to Mill your deck. An other way of summoning or searching for a God could be by using ""Mound of the bound creator"" and destroy it. But I feel it's less consistent than monster cards, cause monster cards are important too in such a heavy oriented trap deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's not a secret that having all 3 Gods in one deck, is not a good idea. But Paleozoics and maybe DarkMagicians archetypes are the only 2 decks that can somehow use them. Every Egyptian God has some advantages and disadvantages... That's why it's better to use 1 of them in a deck, that's built around it. I don't recommend you to play this one, but it's not impossible to beat even strong enemies like Odion and Vetrix for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paleozoics reminds me of the cards ""Metal Reflect Slime"" (cause it's a trap) and ""Egyptian God slime"", that has same attribute and type. In the anime ""Attack on Titan"" a Paleozoic creature called ""Source of all living matter"" is responsible for giving God-like powers to others life sources and is the oldest living source in this world. You can think of it as true God, so that's how it matches with the Egyptian God archetype.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason I run 24 Paleozoics cards is simple.

Es un mazazo y todavia gana m&aacute;s que nada por que el 90% de la gente no sabe como reventar el Empen o bien les cuesta y gastan recursos. No es para nada todo lo roto que estaba antes, por que antes era un mazo degenerado <em>(Hablamos de tiempo donde estaba legal Wind Statue)</em> donde LITERALMENTE no te dejaba jugar. Una handtrap bien puesta y te mata, pero es si no de, mi mazo favorito para jugar. Juego tres Stri por que despues de mucha iteracion mental, el banishear una carta de un Cementerio es un efecto que no solo SIEMPRE vas a poder activar, si no que es uno util para sacarle value al oponente como para en primer turno banishearte tu propio Cementerio y reutilizar la Shifter. Y juego tres Empen por que me gusta. Yo dentro de lo malo que esta, sigo sintiendolo competitivo, que se yo.</p><p>Para m&aacute;s sentimiento, con este mazo fui a mi primer torneo regional <em>(Buenos Aires 2024)</em> y le tengo cari&ntilde;o tambien por eso.&nbsp;</p>"

The support for Infernoids from Terminal Revenge is what kids today might call ""cracked!"" Infernoid Evil's foolish burial of up to ELEVEN Infernoid bodies to the GY is unmatched by any other card in Yugioh. Not only that, it searches for any Infernoid spell/trap from deck when it reaches the GY or banished, further enabling your consistency! The new archtypal boss monster, Infernoid Flood is also nothing to scoff at, since it negates a summon, banishes from field, and floats into any Infernoid from deck when destroyed. Oh, and the rest of the Infernoid spell/trap support is also incredible - they're all very decent!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">When paired with Snake-Eye, Infernoid has definitely modernized enough to be a new powerhouse in the 2024 TCG meta, despite the hits to Snake-Eye in the September 2024 banlist. Grass Looks Greener also has been unbanned, and this card (if it resolves) turns Infernoid into an unstoppable juggernaut - you basically win when it resolves! Like in the Duel Terminal Lore, Infernoids will be a flood of purifying inferno to every unfortunate deck it comes across!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><br /><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The deck is played with 60 cards since it is fairly consistent, contains a lot of garnets and can potentially draw/search a lot of cards.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>INFERNOID </strong>cards form the main body of the deck comprising more than half of the cards. I went for a thicker than usual line-up of Infernoids for this 60 card build due to the availability&nbsp;of Grass Looks Greener. For the Infernoid monsters are x2 Devyaty, x2 Onuncu, x1 Attondel, x1 Seitsemas, x2 Sjette, x2 Piaty, x1 Patrulea, x2 Harmadik, x1 Antra, x1 Pirmais, and x3 Decatron. The ""VOID"" cards are a sub-archetype of Infernoids, and they are the spell/traps that support the strategy. In the deck are included x2 Vanishment, x2 Breach, x2 Imagination, x2 Reignition, x1 Feast.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>SNAKE-EYE</strong>&nbsp;cards are a supplementary engine for this deck that support the Infernoid strategy. Since Infernoid Decatron is a level 1 fire with a foolish burial effect that isn't once per turn, it can be used several times a turn with it's initial summon, Snake-Eyes Oak, Flamberge Dragon and Promethean Princess. The engine is as minimal as possible since it designed primarily&nbsp;for the repeated usage of Decatron and to provide a lot of link material. It is composed of x1 Ash, x3 Diabellstar, x3 WANTED, x2 Original Sinful Spoils, x1 Poplar, x1 Oak and x1 Flamberge Dragon.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">There is a small <strong>NEMESES </strong>package used in this deck as extenders, recyclers and to summon Colossus. Nemeses flag is searchable via Bonfire, so if you already have Snake-Eyes Ash in hand, this is your secondary search target. Flag searches for Corridor, and Corridor turbos out Thunder Dragon Colossus, an extremely oppressive floodgate for most decks. The Nemeses cards are also always summonable since Infernoids always banish their monsters. It is composed of only 3 cards - 2 Flag and 1 Corridor. 1 Colossus is in the Extra Deck as the summon target for Corridor.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>STAPLES </strong>featured in this deck are blind second cards like x3 Droplet, x3 Triple Tactics Thrust and x3 Triple Tactics Talents. Since Infernoid naturally play well going second, these cards compliment the strategy fairly well. The other staples in this deck are consistency cards, since this giant 60 card pile needs every starter it can get.

Even if your opponent tries to negate Onuncu/Devyaty's boardwipe, they have their respective negates which allows their effects to more successfully resolve even though your opponent has an established board!

With ""That Grass Looks Greener"" finally unbanned at 1, Infernoid has an insane ""instant-win-button"" with such a powerful card that is searchable with x3 Thrust and x3 Left Arm Offering! Even without the grass, Infernoid is still a GY combo juggernaut that can reliably go first or second as a 60 card pile, very much like Branded!

I've seen other decks and they always play the meta 3 of these 3 of the other.&nbsp;<br /><br />You don't need 3 ash or 3 Maxx-C or whatever you meta sheeps play. As long as you can disrupt their plays and make their monsters face down with Jioh most of the time its enough to stop their tracks. Unless they use Rituals or fusions in which it tributes them. But the meta changes and most of the time it won't always be the same.<br /><br />Either you can go a 7 row win streak or lose 1-3 games until you can come back. It's all about finding the enemies chokepoint if you ever go first or even 2nd.<br />&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<br /><br />Meizen &amp; Dancing leaves into Jioh is always good. Mostly never target their face down Jioh'd monster because its a dead spot if they can't out their own monsters.</p><p>Kagero in GY is a target 1 negate protection.<br /><br />Tobari can tank attacks for 1 turn when turned face up or SpeSummon that turn.<br /><br />Daruma is that 1 Nibiru but without the token. Good for Dancing leaves targets.</p><p>Yaguramaru is that one remover for mostly things that are annoying mostly Spell/Trap or cannot be destroyed by card effects.</p><p>Hanzo Search&gt; Duplication&gt; Set&gt; Next turn tribute hanzo SS 2 Tobari 1 Face up and Face down &amp; 1 Mitsu face-up for 1 Negate then Fusion into most likely Jioh for target 2 Face down.</p><p>Getsuga is a good card when you know the opponent doens't have any negates or you need an extender for plays on your new turn. Also 3k Defense is good.</p><p>Always Notebook for 2. Unless for some reason you're desperate af and need that 1 facedown card to survive. Otherwise get 2.</p><p>Remember Saizo has protection.</p><p>Don't look down on the field spells. Tenchi is a massive win if the opponent destroys it and your GY/Banish is filled and they cannot read for their lifes. Also it helps you destroy annoying things and with Meizen attacking directly with the other ninjas its mostly 1-5 pops. If the enemy doens't do anything after you attack don't pop if necessary in case they have something reactive to cards being destroyed in their hands. Village protects and recycles for the grind.</p><p>Baku recycles from GY or helps you reset Dancing or Duplication when the monsters summon by them are gone.</p><p>Green ninja is a Wild Card either it works or helps you get Elf from extra deck for Gigantic in case of not having much to do.</p><p>Iron digger for game or pop 1 or equip to enemy &gt; pop enemy banishing 1 ninja from your GY that you want back &gt; pop enemy &gt; Iron activates and you get to SS from Banish.</p><p>Did you know that Hanzo isn't OPT also did you know that Hanzo isn't hard OPT.</p><p>Have Jioh face up and then flip up 1 of your cards to pop 1 with Jioh. WOW he has another effect!!?!?!</p>

If you need any further adjustments or clarifications, let me know!</p><p>In a **Raidraptor** deck, you can consider swapping out certain cards in your Main Deck for cards from your Side Deck based on the matchups and strategies you anticipate facing. Here&rsquo;s a guide on which cards can be interchanged effectively:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>### Cards to Consider Moving from Side Deck to Main Deck</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. **Phantom Knights' Fog Blade**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Provides excellent disruption against opposing monster effects, making it versatile against various decks. You can run 2-3 copies in the Main Deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. **D.D. Crow**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Effective against decks that rely on the graveyard, such as **Zombies** or **Dark** strategies. A solid choice if you're facing those matchups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. **Lancia**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Great against decks that rely on banishing effects, such as **Spiritual Beast** or **Phantom Knights**. Consider including it if you face many banish-heavy strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. **Cosmic Cyclone / Twin Twisters**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: If you find yourself facing many backrow-heavy decks, having additional Spell/Trap removal can be beneficial. Twin Twisters can also help you discard cards for effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. **Anti-Spell Fragrance**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Good against decks that rely heavily on Spell cards, especially **Pendulum** decks. Consider this if you're up against a lot of spell-centric strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. **Nibiru, the Primal Being**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Effective against combo-heavy decks that summon multiple monsters in one turn. If you anticipate facing such decks, consider adding it to the Main Deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7. **Imperial Order**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Can shut down decks reliant on Spell cards, but ensure you're managing your own Spell card use when including this in the Main Deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8. **Red Reboot**</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- **Reason**: Strong against trap-heavy decks. If you're facing such opponents, having this in the Main Deck can be beneficial for quick counterplay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>### Suggested Swaps</p><p>Depending on the matchups, you might consider replacing some cards in the Main Deck with these options:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- **Raidraptor - Readiness** (1-2 copies can be reduced)</p><p>- **Raidraptor - Nest** (consider reducing if you have enough other ways to get your core monsters out)</p><p>- **Raidraptor - Call** (you might cut one copy if you're adding strong tech cards)</p><p>- **Other lower-impact cards** in the Main Deck that don't align with your strategy against your current opponents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>### Conclusion</p><p>Adjusting your Main Deck with these cards from the Side Deck allows for increased versatility and adaptability against your local metagame. It's essential to analyze your typical opponents and adjust your Main Deck accordingly. If you have specific matchups in mind, I can help tailor the swaps even further!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

(Additionally, Albion the Shrouded Dragon can be used as Albaz via its effect).<br />2 Spriggans Kitt are effective for recovering Branded Retribution, allowing you to revive fusion monsters from the graveyard and retrieve Branded Fusion to your hand.<br />Monster Reborn can be used to bring back Saronir, which enables a Synchro Summon of Bystial Dis Pater. If you can summon Dis Pater, the chances of winning are high since it&rsquo;s nearly endgame at that point. With many banished monsters, Dis Pater can revive them (if you can bring back Mirrorjade, that&rsquo;s ideal).<br />The deck is very vulnerable to hand traps like Veiler or Imperm, so defense with Book of Eclipse or Forbidden Lance is necessary.<br />If you can establish a good field when going first, you can aim to summon El Shaddoll Winda on the next turn to control your opponent (greatly increasing your chances of winning).</p>"

Junk Collector + Pyro Clock of Destiny + D.D.R.,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, Final Countdown FTK will be possible. Yes, you heard it. In Ranked, within 300 sec, you can pull it off. Let's rev it up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UY4BcYJWW8"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you have drawn everything, Synchro Summon Ravenous with Librarian + Stardust Synchron, seen in 6:45 in the video. However, if you have enough counters on ""Synchro World"", you can adjust levels to your preference.</p><p>2) To Special Summon Winged Kuriboh, you need to make a path to Chain Link 3. Start with playing ""Final Countdown"", then activate Ravenous to discard 2 cards and target itself. They have to be ""Junk Collector"" and ""Pyro Clock of Destiny"", no matter what. Finally, you can Special Summon Winged Kuriboh because you are on Chain Link 3.</p><p>3) Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. You can banish anything as DARK but you have to banish ""Junk Collector"" as LIGHT.</p><p>4) Play D.D.R and discard anything but ""Primal Seed"" to Special Summon Collector. There, you can activate Collector to banish Clock to advance ""Final Countdown"". Then, fetch D.D.R + Clock with ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>5) Play D.D.R but you have to discard Clock to Special Summon Collector. Repeat this step, with the loop explained in #4 in mind, until you win with ""Final Countdown"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Reinforcement of the Army"" can be found by completing the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- You don't have to craft ""Foolish Burial"" to save 30 UR! However, know that you can't be able to send ""Junk Converter"" to GY for ""Junk Synchron"".</p><p>- ""Junk Synchron"" + ""Final Countdown"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Junk Converter"" + ""Junk Speeder"" + ""Junk Collector"" can be found within ""Scrap Iron Soldiers"" Secret Pack to save 120 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Synchro Creed"" can be found within ""The Masters Saga"" Timed Pack to save 30 SR! Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Jet Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found either within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" or ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Packs to save 60 SR!</p><p>- These following cards can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR and 60 UR:</p><ul><li>1 x Stardust Wurm &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Stardust Synchron &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Wheel Synchron &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Stardust Illumination &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Duelist Genesis &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x On Your Mark, Get Set, DUEL! &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 UR</li><li>1 x Crimson Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 UR</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 690 SR and 270 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

This time I bring you Dogmatika Infernoid.</p><p>As a prelude, Dogmatika cards really don't like the Extra Deck and I'm not just talking about your opponent's Extra Deck here, but also your own so they are really good at running multiple cards in their Extra Deck that really just want to die for maximum plusses. For this Reason we run Granguignol, Chimera, N'tss, Garura, Infernoid Evil, Wind Pegasus, Malong and Herald of the Arc Light as well to a lesser extent Despian Luluwalilith to gain access to some disruptive effects by simply milling our own Extra Deck. On the flip-side, the Dogmatikas also really don't like that your opponent has an Extra Deck and like any religious organisation that doesn't like you to have nice things they have their ways to make your opponent mill their own Extra Deck because their god says so (and I wouldn't really recommend to disagree when Alba Zoa came up to your house and demanded you mill half of your Extra Deck or that many hand cards because that guy does not look like a very pleasant fellow)</p><p>Now as for the Infernoids, they're a different religion inspired theme with their OCG names based on different Biblical/Kabbalistic demons who really care about the overall level of all the monsters you control (if we ignore Decathron) and they really don't like your opponent to have resources in their graveyard or at least use it as an excuse to cull their own ranks to keep the current overall level of monsters you control in a realm that would enable more Infernoid plays and they really enjoy a filled graveyard (That's why Reasoning and Monster Gate are here since those just skip past all the Infernoids (except for Decathron) to keep their summoning cost well supplied. Lair of Darkness is a fun little tech card that can really mess with your opponent when you control Infernoids since Onuncu, Devyati and Flood have effects that tribute monsters for cost to negate somethign and your Decathrons (basically your end board) will constantly copy one of the first two so you're pretty much guaranteed to disrupt your opponent A LOT.</p><p>Now what do those two strategies bring to each other? Infernoids don't really care about most of their Extra Deck and Tierra is another awesome tool to mill cards from it while Evil just gets you another Infernoid backrow when it gets milled by a Dogmatika (we could make an argument to run a second Evil over Garura to keep one to summon with Instant Fusion later). Meanwhile your Infernoids themselves benefit from the field filled with monsters that Dogmatika provides while also semi-floodgating the opponent out of their Extra Deck.</p><p>A nice little tech Engine is the Predaplant package in the deck: Lonefire/-&gt;Ophrys Scorpio + a Discard turns into a search of Instant Fusion via Cobra (which can summon Evil) and Cherubini which in turn can mill Rhino Warrior which then gets to mill ANY Infernoid to fulfill the banish condition for Evil's first effect (which is an insane mill) and then we're off to the races with the Noids and this is before we even lock ourselves out of the Extra Deck.</p><p>Evil + any one-banish Infernoid + Cherubini then makes Flood, Evil searches any Void card since it got sent to the grave and from there you can either make Tierra to mill 3 cards from the Extra Decks (making lots of future options available by milling Granguignol, Chimera (to revive a Decathron immediately after it tributed itself after it used its effect) and Wind Pegasus or going for immediate plusses in the form of Garura, N'tss, Malong and/or Herald)</p><p>Keep in mind that this deck won't win any events but it sure as hell will infuriate your friends in a more casual setting. There can be an argument to add Grass since it's now at 1 but considering the card is pretty expensive I stopped myself from doing so</p>"

Unchained ignores shifter cuz they only need to be destroyed to proc, letting you end on a few interrupts under the banish clause without banishing a bunch of important resources. While there are solid points to nib the usual combo, you can now just hold engraver's revival effect and then make sequence-&gt; desirae on the crackback.&nbsp;</p><p>Agnusdei and Lacrima kind of seal the deal by allowing you to play graveyard volley ball with any of your musketeers or desirae by using Lacrima to revive agnus, then using Lacrima's effect to revive non link light fiend of choice at any point of the opp's turn. Of course it needs setup, but once it is, nib and board breakers don't matter. Bystials and d.d crow banishing targets do though, making something like ghost belle a viable consideration.</p><p>one new 2 card combo line lets you end on caesar, chamber, caspar with last stand + a search, and desirae with lacrima/ Agnusdei set up. Basically it adds an omni negate on top of caesar, rage-&gt; s:p and a double caspar search (ie cross domination + last stand). You go from 6 interrupts to 9. (second caspar search,&nbsp; desirae, and desirae's grave effect). All thanks to the new cards.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, there are 12 free slots. Ash, imperm and droplets hits the most things, but you can swap them out for triple tactic cards, or other handtraps. Into the vrains is a volatile card that can let you pierce the board with impunity, so at worst side it if you plan to go first. Side deck can be tailored to your area, but i just chose high impact cards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

If she gets negated... well... uh... good luck.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, your game plan with this deck is to reach 2 plants on the field and summon Aromaseraphy Jasmine. Then you use one of many LP gain effects to trigger her effect. Rosalina is the best at this, but other cards, especially your Rikkas should be able to compensate if you don't brick.&nbsp;</p><p>Your methods to get to Rosalina are as follows (but not limited to)</p><p>1) Mudan. There are a few Plants in this deck that Special Summon themselves. Rosalina is your preferred Normal Summon, so be careful using Mudan. Anyhow, Mudan can search Glamour which then allows you to search Rikka Petal by tributing Mudan and then Rosalina since they share a Level.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Rikka Glamour (See above)</p><p>3) Aroma Blend. Aroma Blend lets you search one of the Wind Traps and instantly activate them. Humid Winds is literally just search an Aromage. If you can, your activation of Aroma Blend in a turn is more ideal to be aimed at Blessed Winds, but Humid Winds is still good.&nbsp;</p><p>4) Lonefire Blossom. Since this takes your normal summon, you try this method, you may want to try doing Rikka stuff first to bait out handtraps.&nbsp;</p><p>5) Piri Reis Map. Searches for any 0 Atk monster. Be warned that the 2000 LP you pay actually matters in this deck, especially since it usually turns off the extra normal summon from Aromage Jasmine unless you pitch one of the Lv 1 fairies targetting one of the Extra Deck Aromages.&nbsp;</p><p>6) One for One. Nuff said.&nbsp;</p><p>7) Literally any two Plant Monsters + Aromaseraphy Angelica. Its a moot point at this point, since you can likey get the full Aromage Combo off at this point, so use Angelica as an extender in this case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ideal Endboard</strong></p><p>From the few tries I've had with this deck uninteruptted, you will usually get 3/4 of these on the field, though you may have to think first.&nbsp;</p><p>1) Aromalilith Rosemary</p><p>2) Aromalilith Magnolia</p><p>3) Aromaseraphy Sweet Manjoram</p><p>4) Teardrop the Rikka Queen.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, you should have access to 2 or even 3 of the Aromage Wind Traps and one of the Aromage Tuners in hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes if you can trigger Blessed Winds on the opposing turn early enough, you can also regain Aromage Manjoram.&nbsp;</p><p>The comboes can be finicky depending on the starting hand and there can be a lot of luck if you try to take advantage of the Sylvan Xyz or Aromage Jasmine draws.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, your interuppts on your opponents turns will be dependant on your spell/traps since they can grant you LP, which trigger: Manjoram's GY Banish effect, Seraphy Rosemary's Negate (Rare), Sweet Manjorams 1 Targetted Destruction and Dried Winds Targetted Destruction. Note that most of these will go off automatically, so be warned.&nbsp;</p><p>Blessed Winds and Humid Winds will be your main way of triggering these, but the Level 1 tuners can also do so in a pinch.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, if you choose to summon the Rikka Queen, you get a seperate free tribute of an opponents monster. Note that often you have to give up Magnolia to do so. This can be a problem because Magnolia alongside Sweet Manjoram keep your monsters together by turning your Plants into conditional Towers.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Because of the above. Keep your LP in check at all times. The only time you want it lower than your opponents is if you want an extra trigger from Humid Winds. Dried Winds second effect can help you modulate this purposely if you have an LP advantage.</p><p>....uh I think I've run out of things to say so I'll just describe the purposes of certain cards in the deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Rose Girl: Lots of cards need discards or benefit from a plant being in the hand.

But if you are like me-- you have the itch to play sharks NOW.</p><p>Surfacing Big Jaws is the new best card in the deck, getting you instant access to other impressive Shark cards like Abyss shark. The trick here is getting his special summon effect online-- which can save your normal summon for something like Lifeless Leaffish!</p><p>Without the 'Seventh' cards to immediately start your plays, you will need access to some other good spells to help out Big Jaws. Upstart is a good start, giving you a free cycle. white reincarnation is also a helpful way to begin your turn, searching out a White Stingray to extend your board later. While on the topic of extension, White Mirror will surprise you with how much value it can get. If you have a good opportunity to use it early, don't hesistate: but it can surely get plenty of value later if targeting a monster like XYZ Remora, whose effect is NOT once per turn. Finally, the best option is always One for One. It can be used to get out a free Beautunaful Princess, getting you straight into Big Jaws.&nbsp;</p><p>As for end boards, this take on the deck aims for a similar board to any other you will find online. The Sharks have a ton of good XYZ monsters in their toolbox, so you can jusdge what to end on depending on your opponent's deck!</p><p>Of course, when the 'Seventh' cards do eventually drop in the TCG, I recommend you switch out the White Aura Engine and the Upstarts, they will fit all seven 'Seventh' cards you need perfectly. But-- If you are looking to get in some Shark action early, give this list a try!</p>"

Your opponent gets handlooped, starting off their duel with a single card, while you combat them with your set-up GY and army of Chimera monsters!&nbsp;<br /><br />This particularly nasty ""FTK"" (technically not an FTK, more like a handloop 🤓☝️) is made possible with the combined might of Chimera, Yubel and Fiendsmith to bring this particular set-up to a consistent, safe and predictable outcome when you go first. Even if the FTK combo is interrupted, this deck can easily and effortlessly pivot to more standard gameplay, functioning like a regular Chimera deck with a ton of power and gas!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The credit for this combo and deckbuild largely go to TCGplayer's Hanko Chow - the galaxy brain mad scientist behind this handloop FTK!

This version of Chimera plays normally, until Berfomet is summoned - when Berfomet is summoned, you send to the GY either Phantom of Chaos or Norelas. Also, with the combo lines with this version of Chimera, you don't summon Big-Winged Berfomet in the initial FTK combo since it locks you only into fusion monsters - you summon Gazelle the King of the Mythical Beasts instead. It is composed of x3 Coatl, x3 Mirror Swordknight, x2 Berfomet, x2 Gazelle and x3 Chimera Fusion.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>YUBEL </strong>is a small package composed of x1 Terraforming, x3 Nightmare Throne, x1 Spirit of Yubel and x1 Yubel. You either search for Phantom of Chaos (to send to the GY or use as fusion material) or if you already have access to Phantom of Chaos, you can search Yubel instead. Searching for Yubel would eventually make Phantom of Yubel so you can isolate your FTK combo from handtraps like Nibiru or Droll.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>FRIGHTFUR </strong>cards are a mini package in this deck to further enable fusion plays and to assist with card advantage. The strategy needs ample amounts of resources in hand for discard fodder and fusion material, and the package provides ample&nbsp;resources specifically for those uses.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>FIENDSMITH </strong>package is unfortunately a must-have for this deck to function, as it's main purpose is to summon Aerial Eater so it can send to GY either Phantom of Chaos or Norelas. It is composed of x3 Engraver, x3 Tract, and x1 Lurrie.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>STAPLES </strong>in this deck are minimal, since this deck is full of engine to fulfill its FTK. Only 4 staple cards are maindecked, and they are x1 Called By the Grave and x3 Triple Tactics Talent. Don't let the lack of staples fool you into thinking this deck sucks, all the engine cards in this deck has so much gas it can usually break through established boards by itself!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In the <strong>SIDE DECK</strong>, all the cards are dedicated to boardbreaking - after you FTK your opponent going first, the boardbreaks should help you pierce through your opponent's defenses going second. Coupled with the immense ""gas"" this strategy has, Chimera can power through almost through any board. The <strong>SIDING PATTERN</strong>&nbsp;for this deck is removing the entire Yubel package (3 Nightmare Throne, 1 Yubel, 1 Spirit of Yubel), Phantom of Chaos and Norleras for an additional 7 cards from your Side Deck. If you need additional space, you can remove 1 Edge Imp Chain and 1 Frightfur Patchwork.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Chimera Norleras FTK's win condition is resolving Phantom of Chaos copying Norelas in the GY, then using the handloop effect while the Chimera player has a set-up graveyard. This is done by sending Phantom of Chaos and Norleras through various means to the GY, then reviving Phantom of Chaos from the GY with Muckraker of the Underworld! Both fiends are sent to the GY with Berfomet The Mythical King of Phantom Beasts (Chimera combo line), Aerial Eater (Fiendsmith combo line), and Nightmare Throne (Searches Phantom of Chaos).&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here is an example combo for the FTK with a set-up graveyard:</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Cornfield Coatl + Any Fiend + Fiendsmith Engraver + 2 discards = Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts + 1 hand-rip + monster negate (Swordknight in GY) + targeting protection (Cornfield Coatl in GY).&nbsp;</em></div><ol style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: decimal; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div>Discard Cornfield Coatl to search for Mirror Swordknight from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div>Normal summon Mirror Swordknight.

Protection from monster handtraps with Phantom of Yubel, protection from Nibiru with High Wave King Caesar, and an immense amount of gas gives this handloop an extremely high chance of resolving! If you're going first with Chimera FTK, you're likely to win. The incredible thing with this deck is that it can pivot to regular gameplay as if nothing happened!

You can keep it going until you can't draw anymore.</li><li>If you hit non-Fairy, you stop movement. So, continue with Ixchel and alike to trigger Tethys again. Note that ""Extra-Foolish Burial"" can also let you draw by sending Garura to GY, as long as you don't Set any Spell/Trap by accident.</li><li>Know that card draw has to be caused by an effect, not as cost, in order to draw a card with Tethys. For example, using ""Upstart Goblin"", seen in Side Deck, won't do any help for Tethys but ""Into the Void"" will. Remember this rule well.</li></ul><p>2) Special Summon Nasten with its ability and Link Summon Reprodocus with Nasten + Tethys, which is needed to have a Level 5 monster in your GY for Princess to gift a Level 5 to your opponent for Slash Draw later on.</p><p>3) Place Rain and Lebellman onto Pendulum Zones and Pendulum Summon 2 x Aces + 1 x Yado + 2 x Level 5 monsters. Next, XYZ Summon Princess with 2 x Level 5 monsters as materials. Then, activate Lebellman to change levels of Aces to 3 and XYZ Summon Angineer with 2 x Aces as materials.</p><p>4) Use Princess to gift a Level 5 monster to your opponent and use Angineer to change Yado from Attack to Defense Position. With Yado being triggered, count how many card(s) your opponent has on the field. Unless your opponent has something beforehand, it should be only one thanks to Princess. So, place that many card(s) from your hand to your Main Deck and finalize it with Slash Draw.</p><p>5) For the final blow, activate Slash Draw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Darklord Ixchel"" + ""Darklord Nasten"" can be found either within ""The Opening Act of an Apocalypse"" or ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Packs to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Trickstar Corobane"" can be found within ""Essence of Flora and Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"" can be found within ""Celestial Dragon and Bear"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Slash Draw"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 390 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

It's ability to search any water monster means you can search ran aegerine without worrying about stealing spots for needed non engine, or a searchable gamciel going second. Raiho + georgius shuts down pretty much every deck by itself, so warlock is in the side as you really don't want to have it going second. Coral dragon is nessecary both for interuption but more importantly clearing up zone space, so it's good to run 2. Additionally, getting it banished off of fenrir can be devastating. Lancea is at 2 to avoid fenrir as well. S:P is there as a last ditch effort and because of the locks you will rarely be making her. If you can't afford it you can play chenying instead but most of the time you'll be making gimr aegerine as your second 10.

Its still a nice casual deck, this time i aimed to have more powercards. The Monarch cards are there for fixing your hand or adding you Domain for a Extra Deck lock or adding Stormforth for non target, destructive removal. The Dogmatika cards are in here for the missing power, strength and sort-of endboard pieces. Also, if you want you could add a Schism package, but for me there are enough cards to stop and control the opponent. Overall this Deck works fine together, makes fun and for the budget its a nice starter Deck since its very easy. Also remember, by playing this, you maybe get some hate from your friends.</p>"

You can keep it going until you can't draw anymore.</li><li>If you hit non-Fairy, you stop movement. So, continue with Ixchel and alike to trigger Tethys again. Note that ""Extra-Foolish Burial"" can also let you draw by sending Garura to GY, as long as you don't Set any Spell/Trap by accident.</li><li>Know that card draw has to be caused by an effect, not as cost, in order to draw a card with Tethys. For example, using ""Upstart Goblin"", seen in Side Deck, won't do any help for Tethys but ""Into the Void"" will. Remember this rule well.</li></ul><p>2) While drawing, you can find 2 x Watapon. If you have the button on the bottom right corner of the screen changed to either ""Auto"" or ""ON"", you can Special Summon them. Then, XYZ Summon Promenade with 2 x Watapon as materials.</p><p>3) After activating Fusion Gate, Fusion Summon Nightingale + Crystal + Supreme. Then, Link Summon Insulator with Nightingale + Tethys, which is needed to send Nightingale to GY.</p><p>4) Use Crystal and Supreme to copycat Nightingale in GY and deal exactly 8000 damage in total for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Darklord Ixchel"" can be found either within ""The Opening Act of an Apocalypse"" or ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"" + ""Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Trickstar Corobane"" can be found within ""Essence of Flora and Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 360 SR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

CrystalZero is here so we can pass on it in case the opponent tries to Raigeki or Lightning Storm our monsters before we can steal one of theirs with Dark Knight Lancer.<br /><br />With traps/spells that flip face-down becoming more common to deal with Tenpai, monster-combo decks are getting caught in the crossfire.<br /><br />Once we get Nightmare Apprentice, I can imagine removing some non-engine to make a Biker Goblin/Bystial brew that can search for Emissary, that can more consistently get to Goblin's Crazy Beast.</p>"

Everything is blinding second, and duelists insta-leave when they get their board broken! One turn kill your opponent with the force of a million nuclear bombs with the absurdly high attack power of Tenpai - up to 35400 total lifepoint damage! Not only are these dragons unaffected by activated effects during Main Phase 1 through their archetypal field spell, these cards are so consistent that you can jam 24+ staples in the deck! and You can inundate your opponent with a flurry of handtraps and boardbreakers then proceed to your opponent's final reckoning as you enter the Battle Phase.</p><p>I admit, I'm not the most ""skillful"" duelist. I generally don't think 3 turns ahead, play 4 dimensional chess, predict what's in my opponent's hand, etc. That's why I LOVE decks like Tenpai - it makes dueling so easy and simple that even a ""Yugi-Boomer"" like me can win against meta! I've always been a player who loves ""aggro"" playstyles and I find it sooo unbelievably satisfying dismantling boards and control decks. Naturally, a blind second meta deck is the perfect deck for me (and perhaps for you as well) on Masterduel ladder! <br /><br />Get that Masters 1 in record time with extremely quick and cheesy games with the explosive, devastating and ridiculously powerful Tenpai Dragon!<br /><br /><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/yugi-boomer-s-guide-to-tenpai-may-2024-494490"">If you want a detailed guide and combo on how to use the deck, check out my earlier article by clicking here.&nbsp;</a></p><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br />GLHF Duelists!</div><p><br /><br /></p>"

F0 is just easy to make here (rarely use it myself), Armored XYZ is nice (I like ending on CrystalZero in case my opponent tries to destroy it early on their turn, then trap for Lancer, at least when going first).<br /><br />Emissary From the House of Wax is mostly here as a level 3 Battle Fader against Tenpai. Ken and Gen to loop out opponent.<br /><br />Kagemucha Knight triggers to Special Summon itself on Normal Summon, and we could use both in one turn thanks to Grand Bash, so playing 3 might not be out of the question. Ken and Gen to loop our opponent.<br /><br />Ashura King I've been a bit undecided on, but it's so nice for OTK'ing when you go second.<br /><br />I've got Maxx ""C"" in the Side because I never run it, but you might want to.</p>"

Junk Speeder,"<p>Good day to you! <a href=""/deck/hiro-s-shadow-mill-410039"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>A long time ago,</strong></a> I have depleted my opponent's deck thanks to Panda alongside Hiro. So, I decided to do it again with Junk Speeder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaFDVcd3NeU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Draw your whole deck. If you go second and your opponent has their side filled up, clean 3 x Main Monster Zone (MMZ) with Ravenous/Coral/Baronne/Legatia. If you go first and your opponent has 3 x MMZ empty, have Dragster and Baronne at your side for protection.</p><p>2) If you have played ""Into the Void"" beforehand, set all four Traps and end your turn, resulting into Wattfox and Wanghu being sent to GY. However, you can also send Wattfox to GY with Junk Converter seen right at the beginning of the video, which is okay.</p><p>3) When it's your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these Traps as illustrated below:</p><ol><li>Powerful Rebirth &gt;&gt;&gt; Wattfox</li><li>Give and Take &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu</li><li>Reverse Reuse &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ #2 as face-down and Hiro as face-up</li><li>All-Out Attacks</li></ol><p>3) What is going to happen is that Wanghu destroys Wattfox, which shuts down anything your opponent can try to break you, including hand-traps. Then, via All-Out Attacks, MJ #2 will flip face-up and you can start milling your opponent. While your Traps are resolving, you can protect yourself with Dragster and Baronne, in case your opponent activates something to disrupt your combo...</p><ul><li>I would like to also mention that, around 7:50 timestamp of the video, you should change <strong>Card Position</strong> to <strong>Auto&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Activation Order Settings&nbsp;</strong>to <strong>Off.</strong> Thus, you will save a lot of time and make things automated.</li></ul><p>4) After your job is done with Traps, MJ #2 is going to excavate three monsters, which are MJ #2 + Hiro + Wanghu. Then, your opponent draws 3 cards each time Hiro has been activated. So, sit back and place MJ #2 + Hiro + Wanghu while watching your opponent milling themselves uncontrollably to win the game eventually.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Reinforcement of the Army"" can be found by completing the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""F.A. Dawn Dragster"" can be found within ""Tournament Athletes"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Junk Converter"" + ""Junk Speeder"" can be found within ""Scrap Iron Soldiers"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Jet Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found either within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" or ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Packs to save 30 SR!</p><p>- These following cards can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 180 SR:</p><ul><li>3 x Junk Synchron &gt;&gt;&gt; 90 SR</li><li>1 x King Tiger Wanghu &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x All-Out Attacks &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Ravenous &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li></ul><p>- These following cards can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR and 60 UR:</p><ul><li>1 x Stardust Wurm &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Stardust Synchron &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Wheel Synchron &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Stardust Illumination &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Duelist Genesis &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x On Your Mark, Get Set, DUEL! &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 UR</li><li>1 x Crimson Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 UR</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

You can also, if stopped trying to do tenpai, very easily just go directly into goblin biker combo, either with what is already in play, or with one of the many extenders. I decided to play 50 cards so that I could play more non-engine, as I have a high density of starters but also a few cards that I don't want to draw because I can search them (though the only card you can actually open that shuts off plays is the full-armored xyz trap, because it becomes hard to get all the material off of fortress)<br /><br />I explicitly request this to not be put on ygodeckprofile, the website is full of scammy ads and steals decks without crediting the person who made them, while slapping on their shitty watermark that blocks the cards.&nbsp;</p>"

Quillbolt Hedgehog,"<p>Do you love 5DS anime? Want to see what happened in Episode 140 called ""Soul Binding Gate! The Sealed Future!"" with your eyes? Well, what are you waiting for? It's time to rev it up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4slRwEp6syE"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you have Ravenous on the field, set ""Z-ONE"" and discard Hedgehog + Gate with Ravenous to pop ""Z-ONE"". Next, ""Z-ONE"" triggers for you to fetch Gate from your GY to your hand.</p><p>2) Use Wok on Ravenous to gain LP to make sure you stay alive. Then, activate ""Dark Hole"" to clear all monsters, especially yours. It matters a lot if you want to play ""Soul Binding Gate"", which is now possible with all conditions being met.</p><p>3) Play Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Iron Wall combination, which lets you revive Hedgehog forever but we need a Tuner on the battlefield. This is where Fleuret comes in and you can pick up any Level 2 or lower Tuner you like. I used Formula because we are reliving the moments of 5DS anime right now.</p><p>4) Due to the wording of ""Soul Binding Gate"", Formula will be destroyed but we can protect it with Dress. After that, with your LP higher than your opponent, you can bring forth Hedgehog forever to deal 800 damage constantly until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon"" + ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Fleuret de Fleur"" + ""Soul Binding Gate"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be either found within ""The One Who Serve Ra"" or ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Packs to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Then, get rid of Librarian with ""Stardust Synchron"" and Synchro Summon ""Black Rose Dragon"" with whatever you have. After the activation of Rose, chain into Wok and target Legatia. Choose its ATK to have more LP than your opponent.</p><p>4) With conditions being met, you can activate ""Soul Binding Gate"" and ""Boogie Trap"". If you haven't discarded Hedgehog with ""On Your Mark, Get Set, DUEL!"", you can gladly do so alongside discarding ""Junk Converter"" with ""Boogie Trap"". Then, set and activate Iron Wall, which is essential to revive Hedgehog forever.</p><p>5) We need to have a Tuner for Hedgehog. So, play ""Synchro Rumble"" and pick up ""Junk Synchron"".

The September 2024 banlist has all but obliterated the consistency of Snake-Eyes, leaving it with 1 Ash and 1 Poplar, but with ROTA, that problem has been largely fixed!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">""Deception of the Sinful Spoils"" is functionally 3 more copies of any Sinful Spoils card you want, since one of the monster it summons (Mu Rcielago) searches for any Sinful Spoils with it's on-summon effect. Not only that, Deception also summons an omni-negate, Ilia Silvia - effectively rendering Snake-Eyes from interruptions like Nibiru and Bystials!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Not only has Snake-Eyes been ""fixed"" by it's Rage of the Abyss power-ups, it has been incredibly stronger! This is bad news for anyone who thought that Snake-Eyes has been phased out of the game by the recent banlist - this deck is currently here to stay in top competitive gameplay!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><br />Want to see the deck in action?

A sizeable <strong>KASHTIRA </strong>package is also used so the duelist can play through Mulcharmy Fuwalos and for extra extension. Finally minimalistic <strong>FIENDSMITH </strong>package composed of only 1 Engraver is used. Despite the 5 archetypes present in the deck, <strong>STAPLES </strong>still&nbsp;form a large part of the deck due to its many 1-card starters and hyper consistent nature.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>SNAKE-EYE/SINFUL-SPOILS</strong>&nbsp;cards form the core of the deck. Although these cards have been thoroughly gouged by the September banlist, it is certainly still competitively viable with the new ROTA support. Due to the banlist, the Snake-Eye cards are greatly reduced in this deck - it is composed of x1 Ash, x1 Poplar, x2 Oak, x1 Flamberge Dragon, x1 Snake-Eye Diabellstar, x1 Temple and x1 Original Sin.&nbsp; This deck core is maximized around searching or summoning from deck Snake-Eyes Ash, the heart and soul of the strategy. Snake-Eyes Ash starts up the entire gameplan, so 10 cards search it (x3 Diabellstarr, x3 WANTED, x3 Deception, x1 Original Sinful-Spoils, x3 Bonfire) in addition x1 Ash granting a total of 14 starters in a 43 card deck! With that many starters, this deck is still very consistent.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>AZAMINA </strong>is the new archetype debuting in Rage of the Abyss, and although it is an independent archetype, it greatly supports the consistency and power of Snake-Eyes. It is a small supplementary engine in the strategy. It is composed of x3 Deception and x1 Hallowed Azamina. It has two monsters in the Extra Deck - Ilia Silvia is the omni-negate and Mu Rcielago is the searcher.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The most minimal <strong>FIENDSMITH </strong>package is used in the deck - x1 Engraver. 1 Engraver is responsible&nbsp;for turboing out D/D/D Wave High King Caesar, an extremely oppressive boss monster that negates summons up to twice and is a natural counter to Nibiru.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The last archetype featured in this deck is a sizeable <strong>KASHTIRA </strong>package. It is composed of x2 Wraithsoth, x2 Unicorn, x1 Fenrir, and x1 Birth. Kashtira is played because it gives more cards on-field for Snake-Eyes/Sinful Spoils to use as cost for their effects. It also allows the duelist to somewhat establish a board when under the new Mulcharmy Fuwalos, since the engine doesn't summon from the Extra Deck or Deck.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>STAPLES</strong>&nbsp;featured in this deck are 12 of the best handtraps this format - x3 Fuwalos, x3 Ash Blossom, x3 Effect Veiler and x3 Impermanence. If Fuwalos is in your hand and you're going first, simply use it as cost for Diabellstar or Deception since you cannot use it anyways when you have stuff on your field. Since handtraps are so dominant, x1 Called By is also included.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>SIDING PATTERN</strong>&nbsp;for this deck is talking out x1 Snake-Eyes Oak, x3 Fuwalos (when you know you're going 1st), and parts or all of the Kashtira Engine. This allows the pilot to put in 10 boardbreakers to play through your opponent's gamestate to allow the engine with it's immense amount of gas to combo through and out-resource the opponent.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Snake-Eye Azamina is a powerful combo deck that can link spam like no tomorrow.

Then, give it to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>4) Activate ""Vision with Eyes of Blue"" away from Yajiro and reveal Blue-Eyes to Special Summon Blue-Eyes at where Yajiro would pop it.

While you are waiting for <em>Destiny Board</em> to win the game over five turns, you&rsquo;ll rely on defensive monsters, backrow protection, and field control to survive. You'll gradually reduce the opponent's resources, while maintaining your own board, so you can establish <em>Destiny Board</em> without interruption.</p><h3>Key Phases of the Game</h3><h4>Early Game (Turns 1-3)</h4><ul><li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Establish your defense and start thinning your deck to draw into <em>Destiny Board</em> and protective cards.</li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>Activate Stall Engines:</strong></p><ul><li>Set <em>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Spy</em> or <em>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Guard</em> to establish your defense early.</li><li>Use <em>Battle Fader</em> to stop any direct attacks and stall for a turn.</li><li>Activate <em>Messenger of Peace</em> to prevent attacks from larger monsters.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Search for Key Cards:</strong></p><ul><li>Use <em>Gold Sarcophagus</em> to fetch <em>Destiny Board</em> or any important card needed for defense (<em>Mirror Force</em>, <em>Solemn Judgment</em>, etc.).</li><li><em>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Commandant</em> can search for <em>Necrovalley</em> to block effects that rely on the graveyard.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Defensive Backrow:</strong></p><ul><li>Set cards like <em>Waboku</em>, <em>Threatening Roar</em>, or <em>Dark Bribe</em> early to protect against attacks or backrow removal from the opponent.</li><li>If you have <em>Starlight Road</em> in hand, set it to counter cards like <em>Heavy Storm</em> or <em>Torrential Tribute</em> while summoning <em>Stardust Dragon</em>.</li></ul></li></ol><h4>Mid Game (Turns 4-6)</h4><ul><li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Stabilize your defense and get <em>Destiny Board</em> on the field.</li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>Start the Destiny Board Win Condition:</strong></p><ul><li>Once you have enough protection set up, activate <em>Destiny Board</em> and start placing the <em>Spirit Messages</em>.</li><li>Ensure you have at least 2-3 defensive options (such as <em>Dark Bribe</em>, <em>Threatening Roar</em>, <em>Necrovalley</em>) before flipping <em>Destiny Board</em> to protect it from cards like <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em>.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen Your Stall:</strong></p><ul><li>Keep using <em>Gravekeeper's Spy</em> to bring out another copy and wall off the opponent.</li><li>Use <em>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Guard</em> to return high-threat monsters to your opponent&rsquo;s hand, forcing them to spend resources re-summoning.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Control the Board:</strong></p><ul><li>Use <em>Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer</em> or <em>Necrovalley</em> to control graveyard-heavy decks like <em>Lightsworn</em> and stop cards like <em>Judgment Dragon</em> from being summoned.</li><li>Utilize <em>Book of Moon</em> or <em>Nobleman of Crossout</em> to handle problematic monsters.</li></ul></li></ol><h4>Late Game (Turns 7+)</h4><ul><li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Secure the win by protecting <em>Destiny Board</em> and managing the opponent&rsquo;s resources.</li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>Focus on Protection:</strong></p><ul><li>Once <em>Destiny Board</em> has 3-4 <em>Spirit Messages</em> on the field, your priority shifts to maintaining the board state. Ensure that your opponent can&rsquo;t remove <em>Destiny Board</em> or any of the <em>Spirit Messages</em>.</li><li>Use <em>Dark Bribe</em>, <em>Solemn Judgment</em>, or <em>Starlight Road</em> to counter any backrow destruction attempts (e.g., <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em> or <em>Heavy Storm</em>).</li><li>Keep <em>Battle Fader</em>, <em>Threatening Roar</em>, and <em>Waboku</em> handy to prevent direct attacks from breaking through your defenses.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Counter Aggression:</strong></p><ul><li>If your opponent tries to push aggressively, use cards like <em>Mirror Force</em>, <em>Torrential Tribute</em>, and <em>Book of Moon</em> to disrupt their offense.</li><li><em>Stardust Dragon</em> from <em>Starlight Road</em> can act as a big body to block attacks and negate mass destruction effects.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Finish the Game:</strong></p><ul><li>Once you have all 5 <em>Spirit Messages</em> spelled out, you automatically win the game. Ensure that <em>Destiny Board</em> and your defensive cards are well-protected until this happens.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Matchup-Specific Strategies</h3><h4>Against Aggro Decks (e.g., Blackwings, Gladiator Beasts)</h4><ul><li><strong>Side in:</strong> <em>Lightning Vortex</em> and <em>Torrential Tribute</em> to clear the board of swarming monsters.</li><li>Use <em>Waboku</em> and <em>Threatening Roar</em> early to prevent attacks.</li><li><em>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Spy</em> and <em>Guard</em> will wall off most of their attackers, while <em>Messenger of Peace</em> stops larger monsters.</li></ul><h4>Against Graveyard Decks (e.g., Lightsworn, Zombies)</h4><ul><li><strong>Side in:</strong> <em>Light-Imprisoning Mirror</em> and <em>D.D. Crow</em> to shut down graveyard reliance.</li><li><em>Necrovalley</em> and <em>Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer</em> will stop cards like <em>Judgment Dragon</em> or <em>Mezuki</em> from being used effectively.</li></ul><h4>Against Control Decks (e.g., Frog Monarchs, Gadgets)</h4><ul><li><strong>Side in:</strong> <em>Royal Decree</em> to shut down heavy backrow.</li><li>Use <em>Dark Bribe</em> and <em>Solemn Judgment</em> to negate cards like <em>Caius the Shadow Monarch</em> or <em>Raiza the Storm Monarch</em>.</li><li>Keep <em>Battle Fader</em> ready to stop attacks from big tribute monsters.</li></ul><h3>Key Tech Plays</h3><ul><li><strong>Starlight Road:</strong> Timing this card correctly to block mass removal like <em>Heavy Storm</em> not only saves your backrow but also provides you with <em>Stardust Dragon</em>.</li><li><strong>Gold Sarcophagus:</strong> Use it to search <em>Destiny Board</em> or any critical card that you need to solidify your setup.</li><li><strong>Gravekeeper&rsquo;s Spy:</strong> Use its effect to bring out more <em>Gravekeeper's</em> cards, building up a defensive wall.</li></ul><h3>General Tips</h3><ul><li><strong>Patience is key:</strong> You are playing a slow-paced, stall-based deck, so don&rsquo;t rush into activating <em>Destiny Board</em> until you have enough protection in place.</li><li><strong>Anticipate removal:</strong> Opponents will often hold their removal cards (<em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em>, <em>Heavy Storm</em>) for <em>Destiny Board</em>, so bait them out by setting other cards and forcing early use of those spells.</li><li><strong>Graveyard Control:</strong> In Edison format, many decks rely heavily on their graveyard.

Dice lets both players roll a die, where higher roller is the winner dealing some damage to the opponent. You can adjust die outcomes with That Six, which you should aim for 6 to deal 6000 damage.

Yubel remains the best way to play Branded, and its powerups is an indirect buff to Albaz and friends. In addition to the regular playstyle of Branded, Yubel can now be used as a monster negate engine - effectively granting the deck an extra 3 copies of Called by the Grave. The Yubel cards are fairly minimal and it is composed of 5 cards. It is comprised of 3 Nightmare Throne, 1 Spirit of Yubel and 1 OG Yubel. Upon activation, Nightmare Throne destroys in deck Spirit of Yubel, which floats into the OG Yubel from deck. From there, a Phantom of Yubel can be summoned, granting Branded another way to deal with handtraps like Ash Blossom! Phantom of Yubel grants a higher success rate for Branded Fusion to successfully resolve - thus winning you more games!&nbsp;<br /><br />Yubel can also break boards and bait handtraps, since most gamestates are monster interaction based nowadays, the opposing player will be forced to prematurely use their interruption in an effort to stop Phantom of Yubel from coming out! After Yubel has sufficiently used up your opponent's interruption, you can go for your regular Branded plays unimpeded, without fear of Ash Blossom or Nibiru!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The Yubel cards also aren't really ""bricks"" since they can be discarded to the GY as part of your Branded combos. If you happen to have both Yubels in the GY (through Branded Fusion, Grass Grows Greener, etc.) you can also make Phantom of Yubel relatively free!&nbsp;<br /><br />While not entirely game changing and it doesn't largely change the strategy, the ""Yubel engine"" grants another layer of protection of Branded.

Realmente me gusta mucho esta estrategia por la capacidad de alcanzar condiciones de victoria muy r&aacute;pido. Pienso que el motor duro Tistina es bastante bueno, aunque tal vez no se ha explorado lo suficiente como para llegar a una buena combinaci&oacute;n/deck. Siento que en alg&uacute;n futuro podr&iacute;a ser meta... pero solo son divagaciones m&iacute;as.</p><p><strong>Capacidad de llegar a condiciones de victoria:</strong> 8/10 (Hace OTK de manera consistente, y lo mejor es que incluso en esas circunstancias puedes jugar sin depender de cosas como el Extra Deck).</p><p><strong>Resistencia a handtraps:</strong> 6/10 (Le afecta mucho, MUCHO el <em>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</em>).</p><p><strong>Resistencia a Stun:</strong> 7/10 (El deck tiene doble invocaci&oacute;n normal si es un monstruo Tistina, invocaci&oacute;n desde la mano y cementerio. Por lo tanto, es f&aacute;cil invocar por sacrificio al Dios de Cristal Tistina. Adem&aacute;s, es sencillo limpiar monstruos, magias y trampas gracias al efecto de destrucci&oacute;n de este ultimo).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resistencia a Floogate: </strong>7/10 (El deck puede jugar sobre There Can Be Only One y Skill drain. Puede jugar con Rivalry of Warlords. pero sufre demasiado con Anti-spell fragance y Gozen Match lo mata. afortunadamente esa ultima no se juega mucho.)</p><p><strong>Resistencia a Destierro:</strong> 6/10 (El deck depende del cementerio. No lo suficiente como para jugar <em>Razonamiento</em> o <em>Pasto</em>, pero le afecta que le tiren <em>Shifter</em> y cartas similares).</p><p><strong>Resistencia a efectos r&aacute;pidos:</strong> 5/10 (Al deck le cuesta superar campos con muchas interacciones. Por eso, siempre intenta reducir o mitigar el campo rival, recordando el requisito de la carta de campo para invocar desde el deck al Dios de Cristal Tistina).</p><p><strong>Resistencia al ir primero:</strong> 6/10 (La construcci&oacute;n est&aacute; pensada para hacer OTK violentos y ganar en turno 2, pero tambi&eacute;n tiene capacidades para ir primero. El Semidi&oacute;s tiene el efecto del Dios de Cristal como efecto r&aacute;pido si este &uacute;ltimo est&aacute; en el campo. Es una interacci&oacute;n poderosa, pero algo dif&iacute;cil de usar. Bien ejecutado, puede cortar turnos por completo. Adem&aacute;s, puedes hacer un combo para dejar a los dos en el campo en el turno 1. La trampa que no llevo en la decklist es como un <em>Change of Heart</em> para cartas boca abajo; podr&iacute;as considerar incluirla en tu construcci&oacute;n si quieres jugar el deck como turno 1.)</p><p><strong>Puntuaci&oacute;n final:</strong> 7/10. Ju&eacute;guenlo! Es muy divertido y, a pesar de las apariencias, es bastante amigable y competente para jugadores nuevos. Ser&iacute;a incluso mejor si no fuera tan caro, jaja. Fuera de eso, mi mejor rango jugando este deck fue Diamante 3. Si alg&uacute;n d&iacute;a Tistina se vuelve meta en <em>Master Duel</em>, ser&eacute; yo... y sabr&aacute;n que habr&eacute; ganado la gloria.</p>"

Vampire Ghost as an example is a very strong card however you need more Vampire monsters for it to even work + any disruption will often stop you right in your tracks.<br /><br />The going 2nd cards E-Con, Mind Control, Snatch Steal and Change of Heart work in a very unique way in Vampires because their rank 6 and rank 8 can just use your opponents monsters as if they were the correct level to summon them and those 2 + your Link monsters are going to be your win condition because they enable OTKs<br /><br />The Synchros are just another toolbox that can come up from time to time but they obv aren't the main focus of the deck, the focus is stealing your opponents monsters and use it to make XYZ and Links.</p>"

But we are still lacking sufficient access to Bibliomuse and whatnot, so I am opting to play 44 cards in the Main Deck to play more ways to get to a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell while also ensuring that certain bricks don&rsquo;t show up in our opener like QQ Enneagon. We are playing a lot of non-engine, but even if we cut the non-engine, we would still see the same issue and not open a Prediction Princess card. And we can play a large amount of non-engine because we just need to see Diabellstar or a Sinful Spoils card for our whole Azamina into Evol line. This Deck is absolutely fine. Comparing this to my previous Evol Prediction Princess list, this is so much better and so much more consistent. THIS is the Evol Prediction Princess list that sits next to the great Prediction Princess Decks. And because you really just play around with the Azamina cards and Sinful Spoils cards to get to where you need to go, it feels good to play rather than what I had in mind for the previous iteration of the Deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Let&rsquo;s say for our sample combo, we have a </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deception of the Sinful Spoils</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and a </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">and 1 other card to just discard.

WANTED adds a Diabellstar monster from your Deck or GY to your hand and you can banish it from your GY and target a Sinful Spoils Spell/Trap that is banished or in your GY other than WANTED and place it on the bottom of the Deck to draw a card. The draw is very good because it gets you a card to send to Summon Diabellstar. Original Sinful Spoils sends 1 other face-up card you control to the GY to Special Summon a Level 1 FIRE monster from your hand or Deck and you can banish it from Gy to target a Snake-Eye or Diabellstar monster in your GY and add a Level 1 FIRE monster from your Deck to your hand and place the targeted monster on the bottom of your Deck. You will sometimes use the GY effect of Original Sinful Spoils over the activated effect if you draw Diabellstar as your starter because in that case, she will be in GY whereas she usually wouldn&rsquo;t be if you started with like Deception. Deception Tributes a monster from hand or field to add an Azamina card from Deck to hand. Rest of the card does not matter, especially not its GY effect because we are usually placing it from GY to the bottom of our Deck to draw with WANTED. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Sacred Azamina</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which reveals an Azamina Fusion Monster in your Extra Deck and send a Sinful Spoils card from your hand and/or field to the GY for every 4 Levels that monster has to Special Summon that monster which is treated as a Fusion Summon.

This deck effectively combines the Yubel and Unchained archetypes to create a versatile strategy that excels in board control and powerful plays. The key mechanic involves using Chimera, the Illusion Beast, to fuse monsters that come from the trap called Soul of the Supreme King into strong fusion monsters like Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon. You can utilize the Soul of the Supreme King to special summon Z-ARC by banishing it and other necessary monsters from the field, allowing you to leverage the power of those monsters. The synergy between Yubel and Unchained ensures that while you control the board with Yubel&rsquo;s destructive capabilities, the Unchained cards trigger additional effects when destroyed, allowing you to maintain pressure and extend your plays. ​Overall, the deck provides a strong mix of offense and defense, making it highly adaptable in duels.​</p>"

First was Phantasm Spiral (a really scuffed list lmao) then P.U.N.K. Fur Hire in 2022 (my third best work), Mannadium Tearlaments in 2023 (my SECOND best work) and now this. Ashened. Volcanic. Snake-Eye. All in one deck.</p><p>This, right here, is my BEST work yet. This can take on even the top decks if you master it, and is STILL a fun deck to play, with A LOT of different combo lines. I'm going to give you an overview of each card in the deck, some combos I've come up with, tips to play it, and what the deck really struggles against. Strap in, because this is a VERY LENGTHY guide. At over 4500 words, this is by far the most detailed guide I've ever made for a deck. Lets get into it, and start making 'Pompeii 2 - Electric Boogaloo' a reality, shall we?</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">==Overview of the Cards==</span></p><p><strong>==Ashened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cards==</strong></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Obsidim, The Ashened City</span></p><p>Ashened rely quite heavily on their field spell. Every Ashened monster in your deck can summon themself from your hand if you control Obsidim. You can also use Veidos's effect in hand to give Veidos to your opponent, destroy Obsidim, then summon Priestess with Obsidim's effect if you don't already have Priestess in hand or on field (if you do, any level 4 Ashened monster works). Since it makes all your opponent's monsters Pyro on your turn only, you can fuse their whole field away with Ashened to Endlessness on your turn. In the End Phase, you can also use it's effect to put another copy of itself in your GY on the bottom of the deck, then draw a card.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extinguishing the Ashened</span></p><p>This card is what usually gets you Veidos, as it sends a level 5 or higher DARK Pyro from your Deck to your GY, however it CAN be hit with Ash Blossom. You can also Fusion Summon by banishing it from your GY, and use monsters from your hand or field as material. However, take note that this card DOES lock you into only Pyro monsters from the Extra Deck after you use the first effect, so try to save it until the end of your combo, after you've hopefully gone full Snake-Eye combo and popped off with Volcanic.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Awakening of Veidos</span></p><p>Now yes, this isn't an Ashened card, but it does support the deck, so I'm including it here. This can also get you Obsidim, and can even get you Veidos or one of the high level Ashened monsters if you're going second and your opponent has a field spell active. This card has the same drawback as Extinguishing, but you are also locked into only summoning Pyros from the Deck, too (not like it really matters, you won't be summoning Diabellstar from the deck anyway).&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Veidos, The Eruption Dragon of Extinction</span></p><p>This card is very important to the deck, as it allows you to destroy your own (or your opponent's) field spell while also setting an Ashened Continuous Trap from your deck. If Veidos goes to the GY from your opponent's field, you can essentially turn it into a board nuke, and destroy all monsters on the field. However this can ONLY happen if it goes to YOUR GY from your OPPONENT'S field. The Quick Effect is really nice, honestly, only downside is that it's during the Main Phase only.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Priestess of the Ashened City</span></p><p>Priestess is the searcher for Ashened. She can Special Summon herself if you have Obsidim on the field (I won't mention this for the rest of the Ashened monsters, because they can all do this), she can add ANY Ashened card&nbsp; from your Deck except herself, which means she can search Obsidim. She's also a level 4, meaning you can XYZ Summon Banshee using her and another level 4 monster, which there's enough of in this deck.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Shaman of the Ashened City</span></p><p>OMG TITTIES YESSSSS - oh sorry I was busy admiring those large boobas of Priestess and Shaman.</p><p>Anyways, Shaman can shuffle 3 Pyros that are banished or in your GY into your Deck, then you can add an Obsidim if you shuffled an Ashened monster with that effect. Pretty simple, and doesn't come up much, but can be helpful occasionally.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spearhead of the Ashened City</span></p><p>This guy's just here so he can be a level 4 to make Banshee or to Link Summon one of the many link monsters you have. The bounce effect basically never comes up but it CAN be relevant sometimes. But you should really be using this to make Banshee or to Link Summon instead.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hero of the Ashened City</span></p><p>Hero can destroy a Pyro monster on the field with it's quick effect in the Main Phase, and if it destroys Veidos with this, you can place an Obsidim from your Deck in your field spell zone. Not bad, but you should try to save this for your opponent's turn so you can nuke the field with Veidos's effect if you need to use it at all.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">King of the Ashened City</span></p><p>King allows you to Special Summon any Ashened monster from your hand (this is generally useless because most of the time you'll already have Obsidim on the field). However if you give your opponent Veidos on turn 1, and manage to get out King, you can instead Special Summon any Ashened monster from your deck since your opponent controls a monster with 2800 ATK or more. Do what you will with this information &gt;:)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ashened to Endlessness</span></p><p>This trap (which you will usually set from Veidos) lets you Fusion Summon on your opponent's turn by using Veidos as a material from your opponent's field (this allows you to use Veidos's effect to nuke, which you should, because the monster you'll usually summon is immune to being destroyed by card effects). On your turn, this is insane, because you can just fuse away most if not ALL of your opponent's field and just go for game with the Veidos fusion monster. The 500 ATK boost for every material you use is a really nice bonus too, because you'll always get at least 1500 extra ATK on the Veidos fusion if you summon it this way. This card can also make all your monsters your opponent currently controls Pyro, until the end of the turn. The only downside to this is that the Fusion Summon effect is Main Phase only, and you can't use materials in hand. Still a GREAT card to fuck your opponent's board up, though.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ashened for Eternity</span></p><p>This trap lets you get Veidos or an Ashened monster from your GY back to your hand. Most of the time you'll set Endlessness instead of this, but if you can get both set then you'll have solid backrow (this won't always happen though). It also lets you steal your Veidos from your opponent then reduce their monster's ATK by 2800 until the end of the turn. Not a bad card but Endlessness is better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>==Volcanic Cards==</strong></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Emperor</span></p><p>The Volcanic boss monster. Easy summoning condition, just banish 3 Pyros from your field or GY or a Blaze Accelerator card, and BAM. 3100 ATK monster, that will usually burn your opponent for at least 1500, and set a Volcanic Trap from your deck. On top of that, burning your opponent for 500 every time they Special Summon? HOLY SHIT this thing is amazing. This burn stacks too, so... you know where I'm going with this &gt;:)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Trooper</span></p><p>The main searcher of the deck, you'll usually add Volcanic Blaze Accelerator or Rocket with the summon effect. The bomb token effect is good, especially if you can discard Rimfire or Shell to use their GY effects. You can even use it to Link Summon Almiraj if you Normal Summoned it. Sadly it isn't level 4 but this next monster is. :)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Rocket</span></p><p>A non once per turn search for a Blaze Accelerator card? Yep. Level 4? Yep. Even a decent beater in dire situations? Yep. This card is insane. You can use it to make Banshee, since it's a level 4. You can use it to search Volcanic Blaze Accelerator. There's so many things this card is good for in this deck.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Rimfire and Volcanic Shell</span></p><p>There two are under the same heading because they're similar (they both have GY effects). When Rimfire is sent to the GY by any means, you can banish it to send any Volcanic monster from your Deck to the GY (usually Emperor). You can also use Rimfire to banish a Blaze Accelerator card from your GY or face-up field to place a Blaze Accelerator continuous spell/trap on your field. Neither of these effects banish for cost, so they can be hit with Ghost Belle or Called By.</p><p>Volcanic Shell, at the cost of 500 LP, can search you another copy of itself while in your GY. That's all it does. But this is VERY useful, as it can let you extend further into your combos. Oh, and did I mention this effect is SOFT once per turn? Yeah... you can extend pretty far with three of these in your deck if you play right.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Blaze Accelerator</span></p><p>This card will NEVER come up, it's only real use is to be sent to the GY to activate its Volcanic counterpart. If you're REALLY desperate you can use it, but I would just use it for its better Volcanic counterpart.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Blaze Accelerator</span></p><p>This card is just stupidly good. You have to send your one-of Blaze Accelerator to the GY, but an extra Special Summon of a Volcanic from your hand, AND a way to destroy the bomb tokens you'll probably be giving your opponent? Jesus this this is insane. You can Special Summon a Volcanic from hand so you can save your Normal Summon for your Snake-Eye combo or Ashened combo, too. :)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Blaze Accelerator</span></p><p>You could play this with three Scattershots, but I don't have room (literally) for the Scattershots. The GY effect can be helpful to send a Rimfire, Shell, or Emperor from your Deck to the GY, but aside from that, the mulligan on field effect isn't bad either, but I've never had to use it for that.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Volcanic Emission and Volcanic Inferno</span></p><p>Most of the time you'll probably be setting one of these two cards off of Emperor's effect. Emission lets you either Special Summon a Volcanic monster from your Deck and return it to your hand in the End Phase, or burn your opponent for the ATK of one Pyro monster on the field (if you do this it will usually be Veidos). If you burn using a Pyro monster you control, the damage inflicted is halved, so try to use it if your opponent has Veidos. Both effects of this card are good, and it's what you'll usually set first off of Emperor.</p><p>Inferno is a negate and burn for 500 if your opponent activates a monster effect on the field, at the cost of banishing a Pyro from your GY. If the banished monster was a Volcanic monster, then you can also negate the effect (it burns for 500 by default). The recycle effect in your opponent's end phase is also nice too, as you can keep going in those longer, grindier games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>==Snake-Eye Cards==</strong></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Snake-Eye Ash (or SnAsh)</span></p><p>The main starter for your Snake-Eye combo. Be careful since this card is limited to 1, if your opponent hits it with a handtrap and can't stop it, then you might be locked out of your Snake-Eye engine. But this card is insane, that's why they limited it to 1, alongside Poplar. The summon effect lets you add a Snake-Eye monster from your deck to your hand, which will usually be Poplar. You can also use it's other effect to send itself and another face-up card you control (usually Poplar or another Pyro monster) to the GY from the field in order to Special Summon Flamberge from your deck.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Snake-Eye Poplar</span></p><p>If Poplar is added to your hand by any means EXCEPT drawing it, you can Special Summon it. On summon, you can add a Snake-Eye Spell/Trap from your deck to your hand. This will usually be the Snake-Eye field spell, but in some cases you might want to get Original Sinful Spoils instead. Even better, if Poplar goes to the GY from any means, you can place a FIRE monster from your GY in your Spell/Trap (I'll refer to them as S/T from now on) zone as a Continuous Spell. This card is just as good, if not BETTER than SnAsh is, hence why it's also limited.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Snake-Eye Oak</span></p><p>Oak can summon a Level 1 FIRE monster from your GY or banished zone to your field or add it to your hand when it's Normal or Special Summoned. It also shares the same effect as SnAsh, allowing you to summon a Snake-Eye monster from your Deck by sending 2 face-up cards you control to the GY including itself. Overall a great card.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Snake-Eye Diabellstar</span></p><p>Mommy? sorry, Mommy? sorry, Mommy? sorry - oh I got distracted again, sorry.</p><p>If she's treated as a Continuous Spell, you can place a FIRE monster from your GY as another Continuos Spell, then Special Summon her from your backrow (yes, for those of you who don't know, this is Snake-Eye's archetypal gimmick - being Continuous Spells. Hmm, reminds me of another deck with Crystals...). The effect on field doesn't come up much, but it can sometimes, when it does it's useful. :)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon</span></p><p>This card is so stupid, I genuinely think it's banworthy. Until, or IF that happens, we cooking with it. Flamberge is what you'll usually summon off of SnAsh or Oak's second effects. It allows you to place ANY monster in the GY face up in the owner's S/T zone as a Continuous Spell, but also lets you Special Summon a monster treated as a Continuous Spell, but ONLY on your opponent's turn. Now here's the effect why I think Flamberge is ban-worthy (but screw my opinions, they aren't important lol). When Flamberge is sent from the hand or field to the GY, you can Special Summon ANY 2 Level 1 FIRE monsters from your GY. They don't even have to be Snake-Eye monsters, which means you can summon the VOLCANIC Level 1's with this.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye</span></p><p>This card will let you, on activation, place a Snake-Eye monster from your deck in your S/T zone as a Continuous Spell. It also boosts your Level 1 FIRE monster's ATK by 1100. AND it lets you Special Summon ANY monster treated as a Continuous Spell when your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster. This card is goated, no wonder it's banned in the OCG.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye (OSS)</span></p><p>This card, right here, is what lets SO many decks with Level 1 FIRE monsters be playable right now. This deck is no exception, with TWO targets (Rimfire and Shell) in addition to your Snake-Eye Level 1's. By sending another face-up card you control to the GY, you get partial access to your Volcanic engine. What the hell. Oh, and it can also add a Level 1 FIRE monster by banishing itself from your GY, then targeting a Snake-Eye or Diabellstar monster in your GY to place on the bottom of the deck. However, you can ONLY use ONE effect of this card per turn, and if you're like me, you'll never use the GY effect, and in some games that might come back to bite you.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Diabellstar the Black Witch</span></p><p>PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP IM BOUTTA BLOW DEEP INSIDE YOU MOMMY OH MY GO-</p><p>OH SHIT, sorry guys, you saw nothing, move along please ;)</p><p>Yes I'm down so fucking bad for her, how could I not be? With that huge rack of hers, those wide, child-bearing hips and - SHIT I'M GETTING DISTRACTED AGAIN - uhm...</p><p>Diabellstar is a staple in 99% of Decks that can run OSS and have an OSS target. Most of the time you'll be searching her with 'Wanted: Seeker of Sinful Spoils' in the Draw Phase to avoid Droll. Rimfire, Emperor, and Shell are utterly AMAZING cards to send to the GY to summon her, and with her effect on summon you'll usually set OSS from the Deck. But yeah, she's an amazing card to have in basically every deck these days.&nbsp;</p><p>I bet she'd be amazing in bed too... DAMN IT STOP BEING SO HORNY</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wanted: Seeker of Sinful Spoils</span></p><p>You'll be adding Diabellstar with this, but if you open her instead of this then its fine. However if you are out of plays you can banish this from your GY after you've also used OSS on field, sent OSS to the GY (without using it's effect on field), or after you've used the GY effect of OSS. This will place the OSS on the bottom of the deck and draw 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>=Other Staples==</strong></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Bonfire</span></p><p>This searches any starter for any of the three archetypes you're playing in this deck. This card is insane. Enough said. :)</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">One for One</span></p><p>This can start your Snake-Eye combo off, and if you can send Rimfire, Emperor, or Shell to the GY for cost, it's even better. You can even summon Rimfire or Shell if you're desperate or want to screw with your opponent a little. :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God this is already 2800 words long and I haven't even gotten to the Extra Deck yet. What the fuck dude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">==The Extra Deck==</span></p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Embers of the Ashened</span></p><p>You'll usually summon this with the GY effect of Extinguishing, using any 2 Pyro monsters. It allows you to recycle Obsidim or Divine Temple, which is a plus. It's also good if you can make it going second since it can destroy one of your opponent's Pyro monsters if it battles, and on your turn it can attack again if you do this. Not terrible, and can help you win some games, but the recycle effect is great.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Veidos, the Dragon of Endless Darkness</span></p><p>Now THIS is a fucking awesome boss monster. You'll usually make this with the effect of Endlessness, using Veidos from your opponent's field and 2 or more Pyros monsters on the field (possibly using a bomb token you gave your opponent with a Volcanic monster as one material, too). In combination with regular Veidos, this can potentially wipe your opponent's whole board (regular Veidos is all monsters on the field, and this Veidos is your opponent's S/T cards). However, this card CANNOT be destroyed by card effects, meaning Veidos's nuke effect does nothing to it. If you use Endlessness to summon this, it'll have at minimum 4500 ATK. I've actually been able to get this to 7000 ATK and just straight up won the game because of it the ATK boost. Oh, on top of that, it also has an effect where when your opponent activates a card or effect on the field, you can destroy that card. I LOVE this thing as a boss monster.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Infernal Flame Banshee</span></p><p>If you are able to make Banshee, she'll allow you to access to the last (or one of) the engines in your deck you haven't started using yet. She can add ANY Pyro monster or send ANY Pyro monster from your Deck to the GY. You need Emperor in your GY? Banshee can make that happen. You need Poplar to start Snake-Eye'ing all over your opponent? She's got that covered, too. You need an Ashened monster to extend your plays? Yep. God she's such a good card.</p><p>She's made out of fire, so I wonder what it'd be like if I couldn't get burned so I we could fu - NO, NO MORE HORNY. STOP.</p><p>Back to the important stuff - you can actually banish her to summon Emperor, and then summon her back to use as material for more combos. Insane synergy.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale (Whale), Salamangreat Raging Phoenix (Raging), and Worldsea Dragon Zealantis (Zealantis)</span></p><p>These are the extra deck monsters you want to try end your turn with on the board. If you can end your turn with Whale and Zealantis on the board, with a Raging in the GY, you're set and you'll be pretty resilient to having your board broken, too.</p><p>Whale is mainly a big beater to have, but the effect on destruction can get back any Link-3 or lower monster from the GY (usually Promethean). Plus the OTHER GY effect is nice too, to destroy a card on the field if a Link-3 or lower monster is destroyed by battle or card effect while Whale's in your GY.</p><p>You'll usually use Raging to make Zealantis, but you also use Whale to do so as well if you need to. Raging's GY effect is insane, letting you summon it from the GY if a FIRE monster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect, then you can give Raging extra ATK equal to what was destroyed (which is permanent).</p><p>Zealantis can let you break your opponent's board and/or trigger some of your monster effects on your opponent's turn, by re-Special Summoning them from the banished zone after you use Zealantis to nuke the board.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy and Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</span></p><p>You can use ANY Ashened monster or Diabellstar to make Dharc and ANY Snake-Eye or Volcanic monster to make Hiita, and steal a monster with the corresponding attribute from your opponent's GY to keep cooking (e.g. Hiita can steal Ash Blossom from your opponent's GY and you can use that to keep comboing). Plus their effects on destruction are nice too. Dharc can actually search Veidos with his GY effect, so that's a REALLY nice touch, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh I also want Hiita to squish me between her thighs~</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I:P Masquerena and S:P Little Knight</span></p><p>I want these two in a three-way so fucking badly- *Sigh*. You know what, I'm not even going to try and stop myself anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>I:P can go into Promethean or any Link-2 or higher Link monster, and give it protection from being destroyed by card effects. Plus she has really big and soft titties~. She can even make S:P if you really need to.</p><p>S:P is stupidly OP. You can make her with Anima, Almiraj or any other Extra Deck monster and you got yourself a free banish. You can even use that effect to banish your OWN Pyro monsters, to let Emperor's burn effect hit just that little bit harder. Plus the banish 2 monsters effect is also insane.</p><p>Her boobs look just as soft as I:P's do~</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Promethean Princess</span></p><p>Ah, one of my beloved FIRE waifus~</p><p>She can summon ANY FIRE monster back from your GY (usually you'll get Flamberge back if you play the deck right and you don't get handtrapped / you play through handtraps) Oh, she also needs ANY two or more effect monsters to summon, so that's a bonus. She does lock you into FIRE monsters while she's on the field, but you can just make Raging or Blowhale with her and then you're not locked any more. Her GY effect to reborn herself and destroy a FIRE monster you control and a moster your opponent controls when your opponent Special Summons is great, too.</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Relinquished Anima and Salamangreat Almiraj</span></p><p>These two serve the a very similar purpose - to extend your plays or enable more. Almiraj can be used to get Rimfire in the GY if you have to resort to Normal Summoning Rimfire, or it can also be summoned with any of the Level 1 Snake-Eye monsters, Volcanic Trooper or Volcanic Shell (but they have to have been Normal Summoned in order to do this, since Almiraj requires 1 Normal Summoned Monster with 1000 or less ATK).</p><p>Anima can be made by using any of the Level 1 Snake-Eye monsters, Rimfire, or Shell. You can use it if you're going second to punish your opponent for summoning a boss monster in a zone Anima will point to, by stealing their monster and equipping it to Anima. Plus you can then use Anima and another monster to make S:P, and get S:P's on summon effect to banish a card on the field or the GY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">==Weaknesses==</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">First thing's first, this deck CAN brick at times, which sucks. When it doesn't, you'll probably be fine depending on whether your opponent has interruptions or not.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">You'll notice in the side deck I'm playing cards which stop banishing (e.g. Lancea, Crossout, and Called By for Shifter). This deck loses HARD to Shifter, Dimensional Fissure, or Macro Cosmos (anything that stops your cards [particularly your monsters] from going to the GY). If your opponent hits you with one or more of these and you don't have an out, you're basically fucked. Lancea DOES stop some of your combos, but for the price of stopping Shifter and COMPLETELY shutting down Ritual Beast, it's 100% worth it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">That said, this deck also stuggles against certain floodgates. Rivalry of Warlords isn't a huge problem for you, but There Can Be Only One (TCBOO) fucks you over so unbelievably hard its unreal. You are able to play under Gozen Match and Anti-Spell Fragrance, but you won't be able to do anywhere near as much as you normally can if either (or both) are on the field.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To counter this, you could replace the one-of handtraps (except Shifter) in the side deck with backrow removal to deal with these floodgates (if your opponent plays these cards, that is).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Droll can also hinder you quite a bit, but you can still end on a moderate endboard even if you do get hit by it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The Mulcharmy monsters ... yeah I'll be real with you, you basically insta-lose to Purulia and will struggle to play through Fuwalos, but it IS possible to do without giving your opponent much card advantage. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">One thing to note is that Veidos actually turns off your opponent's Imperms and the Mulcharmy monsters if you go first and give it to them early (but you might lock youself into Pyros with Extinguishing or Awakening unless you open Veidos and the field spell)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">==Combos==</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Now since this guide is already over 4200 words long, I'll try to keep this section brief.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">I'm not going to give you any specific combos, but I will say, try to save the Ashened engine for last, since Extinguishing and Awakening both lock you into Pyro monsters from the Extra Deck and both Decks, respectively. If I give you even 1 full combo line, this would be at at least 5000 words long, and I doubt most of you will have time to read it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">If you're forced to use your Ashened engine first, you can still possibly make Banshee and access the Volcanic or Snake-Eye engine (if you haven't used Awakening of Veidos, go for Snake-Eye if you're confident you can play it without using the Extra Deck. Otherwise, just go for the Volcanic engine).</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In a perfect world, the engine order should be like this:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Snake-Eye -&gt; Volcanic -&gt; Ashened</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">However this isn't a perfect world so you may only get access to two engines or even one if you're REALLY unlucky. In that case, I'd go:</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Snake-Eye -&gt; Volcanic</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Volcanic -&gt; Ashened (can be other way around as well, since you may not use the Extra Deck much, if at all)</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Snake-Eye -&gt; Ashened</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">==Conclusion==</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Jesus fucking christ, this is over 4500 words at this point.

This deck is mostly (around 95%) ""Elemental Hero"" cards.</p><p>The main focus of this build is to have easy access to polymerization. Not only that, but most of the cards are kind of searchable with the help of ""Giant Rat"", ""E - Emergency call"" and ""Elemental Hero Stratos"".&nbsp;</p><p>The big problem of the deck is that you have to lose your normal summon most of the times, that's why it's important to be aware of the resources you are spending. ""Elemental hero Woodsman"" can be special summoned in your opponent's turn through ""Giant Rat"", so in your turn you can recycle ""Polymerization"" from grave.</p><p>The biggest advantage of this deck is that most cards can be used as fusion materials cause there are no ""BIG"" restrictions. The playmaker of this deck is ""Elemental hero Sunrise"" whose can help you fusion summon again in the same turn another monster too.</p><p>One cool mechanic to abuse vs players that are mostly using mirror forces cards is to, summon ""Elemental Hero solid soldier"" then special summon from hand ""Elemental Hero Stratos"" and destroy some spell/trap cards on the field.</p><p>Some of my cards are quite slow for the modern standards&nbsp; to give consistency to the deck, some of them are ""Giant Rat"" and ""Elemental Hero Woodsman"". To help with this slow paced gameplay, I use ""one day of peace"", ""swords of revealing light"" and ""storming mirror force"".</p><p>The main difference of this deck, compared to others, is that I use easier to execute combos by not combining all the available other hero sub-archetypes. Instead I am trying to take advantage of cards like ""Skyscraper"" and ""Elemental Hero Honest Neos"" to boost up the attack of my weak monsters. While most of my monsters are level 4, I could add more XYZ cards (Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid or even Utopia engine), but I don't like this approach.</p><p>Some cards might not have the best ratios or can be replaced by similar cards. Some of them could be: the second ""Skyscraper"", the x2 ""Storming Mirror Force"" and x2 ""Lightning Storm"" but this is debatable.</p>"

Fortune Lady Water,"<p>Greetings! This is an introduction to ""Fortune Lady Water"" decks as a whole. It's like ""Junk Speeder"" decks, where you will be locked into Synchro Summons. Can be easier to guide if compared to Junk decks because Fortune decks will heavily revolve around resummoning Cardian and Water with ""De-Synchro"" to draw lots of cards. However, don't expect to draw like how you would in Junk decks. It's tricky in that regard. Without further ado, let's bounce!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Md_iwwo0zE"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) You have two ways to start with:</p><ul><li>If you don't have Past in your hand but you have Vision, use Vision to find Past and Normal Summon Past. Then, draw until you find Calling while Light + Water is in your Main Deck. Use Calling to bring forth Light and use Past to banish Light, which lets you raise the level of Past to 2. Getting rid of Light results into Water being summoned from your Main Deck and you can start drawing.</li><li>If you have Past and Vision in your hand, Normal Summon Past. Then, use Vision to find Calling and rest is same as above.</li></ul><p>2) Synchro Summon Tri-Edge with Past and Water. Then, play ""De-Synchro"" to bring Past and Water back. Since you have Past beforehand, Water lets you draw 2 cards.</p><p>3) Use Souls to send ""Illusion of Chaos"" and Special Summon Souls. After using the ability of Souls to draw cards, Synchro Summon Cardian with Past + Souls + Water. You can draw a card with Cardian and repeat with ""De-Synchro"" until you have nothing left to draw...</p><ul><li>Excavation is here to fetch De-Synchro. However, if your UR budget is tight, you can consider using ""Spell Reproduction"" instead. Feel free to check it in Side Deck.</li><li>""Dark Dimension Soldier"" is here, in case you either couldn't find Souls or had to banish Souls with Allure while you have De-Synchro in your hand. Soldier = Past + Water is your equation and if you have banished Souls, you can revive it with Soldier.</li><li>Though you can do it only once per turn, you can draw 2 cards with Ravenous, if you use Hat Tricker along the way. Ravenous = Hat + Water + Past is the equation and feel free to add Ravenous and Hat, if you wish. You can check them in Side Deck.</li></ul><p>4) Make sure you have either played ""Fortune's Future"" on Light or send Formula to GY. ""Past + Souls = Formula"" and ""Formula + Water = Stardust or Tri-Edge"" are your equations. This step is needed because you should have a LIGHT monster in your GY to Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon.</p><p>5) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, activate Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Crusher.</p><p>6) If you have any Spells but ""Primal Seed"" in your hand, send them to BZ with Crusher and deal 500 damage to your opponent for each. Then, find them with ""Primal Seed"" and repeat with Crusher until either your opponent is dead or resigns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- You don't have to craft ""Magical Stone of Excavation"" to save 60 UR! If you are low on UR, I must insist you crafting ""Spell Reproduction"" instead. Feel free to check in Side Deck.</p><p>- ""Magicians' Souls"" + ""Illusion of Chaos"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 120 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"" can be found within ""Celestial Dragon and Bear"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Duelist Genesis"" + ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" + ""Into The Void"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Dark Dimension Soldier"" + ""Type Zero Magic Crusher"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found either within ""The Ones Who Serve Ra"" or ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Packs to save 30 SR!</p><p>- These cards can be found within ""Destiny's Sorceress"" Secret Pack to save 150 SR and 90 UR:</p><ul><li>1 x Fortune Lady Light &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>1 x Fortune Lady Water &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>3 x Fortune Vision &gt;&gt;&gt; 90 SR</li><li>3 x Fortune Lady Calling &gt;&gt;&gt; 90 UR</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 330 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

The support for Infernoids from the selection pack ""Outlaws from the Inferno"" is what kids today might call ""cracked!"" Infernoid Evil's foolish burial of up to ELEVEN Infernoid bodies to the GY is unmatched by any other card in Yugioh. Not only that, it searches for any Infernoid spell/trap from deck when it reaches the GY or banished, further enabling your consistency! The new archtypal boss monster, Infernoid Flood is also nothing to scoff at, since it negates a summon, banishes from field, and floats into any Infernoid from deck when destroyed. Oh, and the rest of the Infernoid spell/trap support is also incredible - they're all very decent!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">When paired with Snake-Eye, Infernoid has definitely modernized enough to be a new powerhouse in the Masterduel meta, despite the hits to Snake-Eye in the recent banlists. Grass Looks Greener is also legal in Masterduel, and this card (if it resolves) turns Infernoid into an unstoppable juggernaut - you basically win when it resolves! Like in the Duel Terminal Lore, Infernoids will be a flood of purifying inferno to every unfortunate deck it comes across!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br />With ""That Grass Looks Greener"" legal in Masterduel, Infernoid has an insane ""instant-win-button"" with such a powerful card that is searchable with x3 Thrust and x3 Left Arm Offering! Even without the grass, Infernoid is still a GY combo juggernaut that can reliably go first or second as a 60 card pile, very much like Branded! With all the new support and banlist unhits, Infernoid is now a force to be reckoned with that can easily combat even powerful tier 1 meta!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Purify your opponents monsters, board and lifepoints with the blazing flames of Armageddon with Infernoid Snake-Eye!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The deck is mosty staying within its archetype bar the Crimson Dragon package in the Extra Deck and the Kaijus in the main (to abuse Battleball) and since Superheavy Samurai need a Graveyard devoid of any Spells or Traps we of course don't run any of those. (Sekka's Light might seem interesting for us but it blocks us from activating Pendulums so I rather don't run it)</p><p>Of course many of the cards from this list can be switched for higher power cards and for example a good chunk of the Soul lineup can be changed to non-engine hand traps instead for more competitive viability and&nbsp;</p><p>What you summon with Crimson Dragon is entirely up to your preference but I've added some options to the Side Deck for now (Dis Pater and Sifr Divine Dragon eat up a bit more money than some trying to get into the game might be willing to spend from the start or for a casual setting)</p><p>If y'all have some questions about some card choices and their interactions feel free to leave a comment</p>

At this point you detach Dragoons to summon the toad, Dragoons triggers and search for some starter and continue the combo.</p><p>The end board you get is with toad, neptabyss (maybe with abyssalacia), arionpos, snopios and heavy infantry in hand. In standby you can special summon shif from banished and go for full ghoti combo.</p><p>The ghoti combo is difficult to use, because Deep Beyond banishes everything, but it can be so useful at the end of the main phase, or in a difficult situation. So be sure to have some starter in the hand, abyssalacia and abysshrine are perfect to search that.</p><p>That combo can be strong, but fragile. If you want to have more consinstency you can go for the normal mermail combo. I don't know how to make the side deck yet, but you can make one to replace ghoti engine if necessary with some handtraps and staples like Zealantis, Trishula or Stealth Kragen, maybe you can use crossout and TTT or D barrier.</p><p>If you wanna give me some advice or have some question you can dm me on ig @Goffry__.

I would like to cut-down 1 Neos but ""Miracle Fusion"" (banish materials) is on the way and without Neos you can't play the game at all.""Keeper of the dragon magic"" basically enables the whole deck. By discarding 1 card you can search for ""Neos Fusion"". ""Neos Fusion"" can summon ""Rainbow Neos"" which is among the strongest cards of the game cause, it can destroy pretty much everything on the field.</p><p>While most old Neos fusion monsters return to the deck at the END PHASE, these new Neos Fusion monsters do not. In your next turn you can always use ""Miracle contact"" to summon again 1 ""Rainbow Neos"" and recycle the materials into the deck.</p><p>One nice mechanic is that you can use ""Neos Fusion"" by sending as materials ""Elemental hero Neos"" and ""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"". This way you can draw 2 cards, while you create a nice setup for the next turn to ""Miracle fusion""/""Miracle contact"" from grave to draw gain 2 cards.</p><p>I feel like there are times that you don't get to hand the best cards possible, that's why this deck has ""Card Destruction"" and ""Morphing jar"". You might have to run ""Neo space connector"" up to x3 copies and Neos to x2.</p><p>Via ""Neo space connector"" and ""Keeper of the dragon magic"" you cansummon Neos quite easily without problem and with ""Wrath of Neos"" you can destroy all the cards on the field.</p><p>The only Neo-Spacian monsters I am using are, ""Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird"" and ""Neo-Spacian Glow Moss"" cause their Fusion counterparts are decent enough.</p><p>Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution is not a fast-paced game as Master Duel is. And it might be possible to use all Neo-Spacians in the deck for nostalgia reasons. But as you can see from this deck, you don't really need them, while all of these Fusion monsters takes so much space from the extra deck.</p><p>""Elemental Hero Brave Neos"" fusion monster is one of the best to search for a Neos spell/trap card.While ""Elemental Hero Neos Knight"" is quite good to kill 2 monsters in a turn (vs ""Gravekeeper's Spy"" and ""Gravekeeper's Nobleman"" for example).</p>"
