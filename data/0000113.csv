The Opening of the Spirit Gates engine gets a Dragoon of Red Eyes, while looping Continuous spells to the hand and being fodder for Golden Lord, and gives the deck another discard engine, which creates a Special Summon that brings the deck through I:P to Rusty, who can, in turn, extend with Shade Brigandine into Verte Anaconda after getting a negate on the board. I'm running Dogmatika Punishment still, with the idea being you can try and combo off on your first turn, but if you're interrupted I want to play the grind game as efficiently as possible. I'm running 1 Omega over a 3rd Nt'ss, for those situation where you only need to pop 1 monster, to get a little extra grindy value. The deck does have a bunch of ways to close games without ever going into the extra deck, so the idea is to get things into a simplified game state, and go for the kill when it is assured."

This deck takes advantage of the new God Slime card being an extra deck monster so the dogmatika cards can play off of him. There are a bunch of traps (the slow part) but I will say they are effective at getting you through a turn or two and setting up the slime. I doubt it would work too well vs the top tier decks but it could be effective against lower tiers. I did not post my side deck, I am still trying to figure that out so any advice would be helpful. Anyway this is a fun deck that just uses some of the new cards from the recent sets!

You could also replace some of the traps for TTT."

Runs 2 copies of Ancient Gear Golem, Ultimate Pound, and Reactor Dragon, as they have some brick potential, but need at least a few of each. 3 copies of Wyvern, and Gear Frame to get what you want into the hand. 2 copies of Ancient Gear Gadget for some added protection. Polymerization is run at 2 because of Ultimate Pound's effect but it can still be pretty useful. Ancient Gear reborn is very useful for keeping yourself alive when no monsters are on the field and can recycle Wyvern's and Hunting Hound's effects. Cross-Dimensional Duel can be useful for protecting your monsters from certain effects or destruction. Ancient Gear Catapult can take advantage of Geartown's and Ancient Gear Fortress's floating effects while also being an easy way to get a Golem onto the field. When fusion summoning, use Howitzer to deal 1000 damage and get an easy Golem if destroyed by battle, whether by you or your opponent. Ancient Gear Megaton Golem can get a Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem when destroyed by card effects and with 3300 ATK, many things wouldn't want to destroy it by battle.

&nbsp;

Now that one of my favorite control decks is no longer nerfed, allow me to introduce my newest Paleozoic Frog deck titled ""Devil Frogs."" I picked this name for my deck, in reference to <em>Beelzebufo</em>, an extinct frog whose name roughly translates to ""Devil Frog"". You might recognize <em>Beelzebufo </em>from the 2017 game Ark: Survival Evolved. And to be honest with you, that name is fitting for this animal, because it was 16 inches long--about as large as a beach ball--and ate baby dinosaurs for breakfast! Oh, and it had horns.

&nbsp;

As for this deck itself, it's not that much different from other Paleo Frog decks. It's either go first or burst, set a bunch of cards, and try to summon Toadally Awesome as quickly as possible. Actually, there is one small difference. This deck uses a small Fiend engine. 3 copies of Lilith, Lady of Lament to search out your Normal Traps, and 3 copies of Dark Sacrifice. Dark Sacrifice helps protect your field from any effects that would nuke your backrow. It also sets up your Graveyard by sending a Level 3 or lower DARK monster like, let's say...Absolute King Back Jack?

&nbsp;

Absolute King Back Jack and Dark Sacrifice are both good tech choices for Paleo Frogs, since this archetype loses to Harpie's Feather Duster and Lightning Storm. When Back Jack is sent to the Graveyard, you can look at and rearrange the top 3 cards of your deck. And during your opponent's turn, you can banish it from the Graveyard to set a Normal Trap from the top of your deck--and you can activate it on that same turn!!"

This can be searched by Weathering Soldier when he is sent to the GY.

Weathering Soldier can be sent from the deck to the graveyard using Catapult Zone, Miracle Rupture, or Foolish Burial. It can be sent from the hand with Doki Doki or Specimen Inspection. Doki Doki can also Special Summon it to the field where it can be sent with a Link or Synchro summon or Nibiru, the Primal Being.

Make sure you know what kind of deck your opponent is using before using Specimen Inspection. This will help you determine a type and level to request.

Adamancipators can easily special summon themselves and search for more monsters off the top of you deck. After summoning, you can send them to the GY with a Synchro summon, Link summon, or Nibiru.

Nemeses Keystone is a great tool for recycling your banished monsters and itself for more material.

Gallant Granite can search for Nibiru, the Primal Being to use it as a hand trap and get more monsters in the GY.

The lv 4 fusions are a great place to start most combos, also the easiest the summon. They can be banished from the GY to search for Time Stream or Fossil Fusion.

The entire archetype is made up of Dark Warrior monsters with low stats, who trigger their effects whenever they deal battle damage to the opponent. The cards are fairly old, which also shows in their overall power: ""Dark Scorpions"" have almost no synergy, are fairly cloggy and pretty slow since most of the time they cannot summon more than one monster. Nonetheless, here is my take at making them passable.</p>
<p>I decided to run the ""Dark Scorpions"" monsters at the following ratios: Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Don Zaloog"">Don Zaloog</a>"", since he is the biggest beater the archetype has to offer that you can Normal summon without a tribute while also having the best effect by forcing the opponent to discard cards if he runs through; three ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Meanae the Thorn"">Dark Scorpion - Meanae the Thorn</a>"" allow you to search other ""Dark Scorpions"" with relative ease while she is equipped with ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>""; two ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Cliff the Trap Remover"">Dark Scorpion - Cliff the Trap Remover</a>"" since he is backrow removal on legs, even though his effect is incredibly slow in comparision to other Spell/Trap removal cards; one ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Chick the Yellow"">Dark Scorpion - Chick the Yellow</a>"", since he is probably the worst of the bunch, but the deck manipulation effect might come handy one in a while; and lastly one ""<a data-name=""Dark Scorpion - Gorg the Strong"">Dark Scorpion - Gorg the Strong</a>"", who's bounce effect is actually pretty nice but is held back by the fact that you need to tribute a monster to summon him.</p>
<p>While the archetype itself might not have tons of consistency, they can get help due to the fact that they have the Dark and Warrior combination. ""<a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Malicious"">Destiny Hero - Malicious</a>"" is an easy Special summon and can be used as Link material, ""<a data-name=""Dark Grepher"">Dark Grepher</a>"" can be Special summoned while setting up ""<a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Malicious"">Destiny Hero - Malicious</a>"" in the graveyard and ""<a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>"" is further graveyard setup in the Attribute/Type combination. The most important generic monster of the deck is definitely ""<a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>"", who can be summoned with relative ease since you can control the number of Dark monsters in the graveyard via the previously mentioned monster plus ""<a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a>"", and he can be a supreme clean-up crew who gives the ""Dark Scorpions"" the chance to run through unimpeded.</p>
<p>In terms of Spells and Traps, the ""Dark Scorpions"" can also make use of their typing and Attribute. ""<a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>"" is a powerful draw option, while the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" allows you to search the right Warrior monster for the case. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" are obviously there to clear out front- and backrow respectively, while ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" serves as a swarming tool or even allows you to take opposing monsters from their graveyard to work with. The rest of the Spells consists of Equip Spells, which can boost the stats of your ""Dark Scorpion"" monsters into preferable regions while also ensuring that you will cause battle damage to the opponent. They can also be used for ""<a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a>"", which is yet another way to gain more monsters than you would normally be able to. Trap-wise, the focus lies on stat manipulation, with both ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Mirror Wall"">Mirror Wall</a>"" weakening opposing monsters so far that they die in battle against ""Dark Scorpions"" and therefore trigger their effects, and the searching of Equip Spells via ""<a data-name=""Armory Call"">Armory Call</a>"", which can also cause any opposing monster to lose the fight by choosing ""<a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>"" or simply cause quite a lot of damage via cards like ""<a data-name=""United We Stand"">United We Stand</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Mage Force"">Mage Force</a>"".</p>
<p>The Extra Deck tries to give the deck coverage in various situations. Backrow removal exists in form of ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", cards that can deal with opposing monsters include ""<a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"". The last effect block is themed around stat boosts, which are provided by ""<a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>"".</p>
<p>The deck is still pretty underwhelming in comparision to what other decks are able to do, but I think this is playable while also staying true to the ""Dark Scorpion"" playstyle.

You even have the option to #mill9 for Gearfried straight from the deck, thanks to all the equip spells Isolde can use! This deck also allows you to take the alternative Three Warriors path by using King Artorigus to grab any Infernoble Arms spells that you need from the deck. The Halq plays utilize the Rose Dragons to easily go into your Captain Roland and Charles with a reduced chance of bricking, and you can use the leftover Halq and another material to go into Dragoon, or if you draw the fusion spell, use Halq to bring out Quandax and make a Savage Dragon on you opponent's turn.</span>"

This deck is one of the most potent abusers of Machine Duplication in the game. Getting out multiple Celfons and Smartfons is crazy broken, and the deck runs a lot of other targets to keep the card live as well. Morphtronics also have access to other crazy special summon spells like Junk Box and Repait Unit. No once per turn restrictions AND the monsters keep their abilities?

I will go through the decklist card by card to tell you how and why they are used along with what they can be replaced by from the side. at the end of the list i will add a list of good water cards that you can use aswell. This deck is susceptible to hand traps and called by the grave.

<strong>Atlanteans:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Neptabyss, The Atlantean Prince.</strong> - This card is your main <em>pitcher</em> to activate your Dragoons. It also adds another Atlantean card to your hand giving you a <em>+1</em> when his effect is allowed to go off and you pitch dragoons. Besides that he has a a <em>High likely hood of being in your starting hand</em> (either as this card or as 4 different options). Just like other Atlanteans he has a ditch effect, which special summons an Atlantean from the grave which makes him a good <em>floater / extender.  </em>Even if this effect is negated it will still send a Dragoon to be <em>sent for cost</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Atlantean Dragoons.</strong> - These are run at three because you cant run more than three. Honestly this card is amazing! He can be <em>ditched for cost by any water </em>monster and he will <em>add any sea serpent type </em>monster from the deck to hand making him a <em>hand floater </em>and makes Neptabyss a +1. He is also a combo starter for multiple combos including an anti nibiru combo.  His second effect is useless 99.9% of the time. He is a level 4 water monster meaning he can xyz into Bahamut Shark.</li>
 	<li><strong>Atlantean Heavy Infantry.</strong> - This is one of 2 Atlantean cards that has a destruction effect upon <em>ditching for cost. </em>This one pops a face-up card your opponent controls. Due to this effect being mandatory it can be used to chain block so that Atlantean Dragoons cant be ashblossomed this usually only works when paired with megalo. and this isnt the only card that can chain block for dragoons. Anything with the mandatory effect can chain block so you are guaranteed your search. Heavy Infantry's secondary effect is rather good too and can actually enable a play if Crystron Quandax was being used - to go into an easy toad (as 6th summon). I run this at 2 to prevent bricks as running at three bricked me a little too much for my liking (if i wasnt running the Ronintoadin and Swap Frogs I would run this at 3).</li>
 	<li><strong>Atlantean Marksman.</strong> - This is the second of the destruction Atlanteans that I run. It can pop 1 face-down card on the field and is primarily used to pop pesky traps and trigger them at disopportunate times for your opponent. Just like with Atlantean Marksman this card effect doesn't need a target to trigger and as such can be used to chain block for protection of Atlantean Dragoons. Also similarly to Dragoons its secondary effect is not used very often at all and I often forget about it but it is able to search for any of the Atlantean monsers I run, so it is technically an eigth way into Atlantean Neptabyss. Due to the brick potential of this card and the fact that there are better spell/trap destruction that I could run, I only run the singular copy of this card.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Deep Sea:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Deep Sea Diva. </strong>- This sea serpent is essentially 3 more copies of Atlantean Neptabyss as when it is normal summoned it can special summon <em>any level 3 or lower sea serpent </em>monster from your deck (usually Neptabyss). Not only this but it is a level 2 <em>tuner,</em> which is a great way of getting Crystron Halqifibrax out on the field. This card is <em>VERY </em>susceptible to hand traps like Ghost Ogre, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler and Infinite Imperminence. When Diva's effect gets negate it stops your neptabyss being so easy to bring out as you have used your normal summon. Luckily there are multiple other ways to bring him out besides a normal summon or Diva effect. I run 3 of her because she makes getting Atlantean Neptabyss in the starting hand more consistant.</li>
 	<li><strong>Deep Sea Minstrel.</strong> - The second of 2 Deep Sea cards in this deck is another <span><em>combo enabler</em></span> but it can also deal with pesky <em>hand traps</em> like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, etc that we don't want interupting our set up. When paired with Atlantean Dragoons in the starting hand you can start the game with a nibiru in their banished pile or a combo that cant be stopped because the hand trap you hate the most is out of their hand. The fact you get to see their hand is incredibly powerful aswell. Due to the fact you know whats in their hand you can predict what they are going to do with those cards and play around that to back them into a corner. And thats just the first effect! Its second effect enables all of our Atlantean monsters and recycles 1 level 4 or lower water monster from grave to the deck when its special summoned.  Since Called By The Grave has been limited I have been running 3 of these because you want to see them often.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mermails:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssmegalo. </strong>- Now we are getting into some big bois. Megalo can special summon himself from the hand by sending to water monsters from hand as cost (Atlantean enabling) with 2400 attack he is one of the only monsters from the main deck that will be doing any attack. Especially seeing as when he is summoned this way he can search for 1 abyss- spell or trap (Abyss-scale Of The Mizuchi) to boost his attack to 3200. But wait he still has 1 more trick up his scale. As an activation he can send 1 face-up <em>attack</em> position monster you control to the GY as cost to allow him to attack twice in a turn. You cannot use this effect however if you go first. As a level 7 he can also enable the deck to go into level 8/9 synchros as wellDue to Megalo being a sea serpent meaning he is easily searchable I only run 1 of him, this also stops him cloggin the hand too often.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssteus. </strong>- The other level 7 card used in the Mermail archetype is Teus. He only requires 1 discard for his special summon which can start combos really nicely with Dragoons as you wont lose any card advantage due to Teus' second effect (when special summoned this way he can add 1 level 4 or lower Mermail monster from the deck to hand). You want to see this card in every starting hand with a Dragoons. Unfortunately there is no way to make seeing him in your hand more consistant at the moment and as such I have to run 3 of him in hopes of seeing him often.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mermail Abysspike.</strong> - Our level 4 Mermail card is called Abysspike he is searchable via Teus and can support the combo into a Toadally Awesome. When he is normal or special summoned he can ditch a water monster for cost and then add any level 3 water monster from deck to hand - with no Marincess Sea Horse in the main deck you only have 2 options (Deep Sea Minstrel or Mermail Abyssgunde). I only run 1 of this guy as he can be a clog and he is searchable through our combo.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssgunde.</strong> - To round off our Mermail monsters, Abyssgunde is used to special summon your other Mermails that are in the grave. This can extend your plays with an extra synchro monster or you can use that monster as link / Trish bait. This effect does not require Gunde to be discard for cost and can be discarded in anyway. Because of how chaining works, we can chain block our opponents optional effects with Gunde in order to keep our own optional monster effect from being negated. I only run her at 1 because I haven't used her much ever and when i do its just to extend my bored, otherwise she gets stuck in my hand.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Frogs:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Swap Frog.</strong> - This level 2 aqua monster is actually a good extender, it requires a discard of 1 water monster to be discarded so that he can special summon himself (this <em>does not trigger Atlanteans</em> but it will trigger Gunde and Bluebeard). Whenever swap frog is special summoned he can send one level 2 aqua monster from the deck to the grave (usually Ronintoadin as it means you cant draw him later on as a brick). He can also target one monster you control (even himself) to the hand to normal summon an extra frog this turn (<em>except himself</em>). He usually sends himself unless you have a monster you want as a normal summon next turn (Diva) as all of his effects are a soft once per turn, so he can special summon himself again and send the other swap frog from deck to grave. Now this is useful as it enables Ronintoadins effect. I have played around with different ratios of Swap Frogs but I found that having 2 was better than having 3 (regardless of the fact that having only 2 limits Toadally Awesomes effect) as it bricks your hands a lot less.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ronintoadin.</strong> - As I was saying above Ronin is usually sent to the grave by Swap Frogs effect as it enables him. Ronins effect is: he can banish 1 Frog monster from your grave and then special summon him to the field. He can be used for and xyz summon of Toadally Awesome along with Swap Frog. I have also used this recursion effect once toadally awesome has died to special summon Ronin as an <em>extender</em> for link play because sadly he cannot be used as a synchro material</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other Water Monsters:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Moulinglacia The Elemental Lord. </strong>- Moulin is a tricky card, he has a great card effect and a fairly easy summoning condition however... he does have one hell of a down side. His summon conditions are that he can be special summoned from the hand when the number of water monsters in your grave is <em>exactly </em>5, this is very easy for this deck to do with the amount of cards that like being sent to the grave and link summoning a link-2 can sometimes be helpful to fulfill these requirements. When he is special summoned this way he can discard 2 cards from your opponents hand at random, this essentially means your opponent starts their turn with 4 cards instead of 6. Be careful with this effect however as alot of cards in the game like to be in the grave (Burning Abyss and Shadoll trigger when sent). Lastly his effect reads that when he leaves the field (by any means) you have to skip your next turns battlephase (essentially meaning you cant attack for 2 turns if you went first). With a 2800 attack value he is the monster with the strongest original attack in my deck and is often used as a beater alongside Megalo. Moulin is a sea serpent which means he can be searched by Dragoons and as such I only run 1 of him (just like Megalo) however if u see him in your hand its a good sign.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lappis Dragon. </strong>- Despite his name Lappis is a sea serpent which means he is searchable like Moulinglacia is. These two cards have been honourary Mermail / Atlantean cards for a long time as they just fit in so well. Especially Lappis as his effect reads that when he is add from deck to the hand (via Dragoons) he can Special summon himself. this is a super useful effect as it means you can get Halqifibrax out when you dont summon a Diva due to Lappis being a tuner. Not only is he a tuner but he i s a level 5 tuner, this means 1 Neptabyss and Lappis can also summon Brionac, Dragon of the Ice barrier. The fact he can special summon himself means he can be used for link bait and for a lvl9 synchro aswell if paired with a lvl4. His secondary effect is a little less useful as he can special summon himself from the when he is added from the grave especially seeing as you can only use 1 of the 2 effects per turn. i run him at 1 because he is searchable and i can bring him back with Coral Anemone if desperately required.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju. </strong>- Gameciel is a kaiju... enough said. all jokes a side he is amazing at outing cards like Avramax, borrelsword, Accesscode Talker and Borrelload Savage Dragon. even if i get 2 in my hand he is a water kaiju so i can Moray Of Greed him back to the deck or use the second gameciel as link bait or synchro material. We dont use any of his other effects (what a surprise) as they are specifically for the kaiju archetype. I run 3 of them in my starting main-deck as you never know what to expect from your opponent and they are usually the things to be sided (especially against Mystic Mine) for Cosmic Cyclone or other side deck cards.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fishborg Launcher.</strong> - Fishborg Launcher is a great target for Halqifibrax to summon due to its recursion effect. This monster does nothing on the field except be a lvl1 tuner however whilst it is in the graveyard and all other monsters in your grave are water monsters it can special summon itself onto the field once per turn however when it leaves it has to be banished. This recursion effect allows the deck to synchro summon multiple times a turn or it can be used link bait. He is a great extender for the deck. He is definetely the best synchro for this deck as all of my synchros are water type so the limitation fishborg has on itself to only summon water synchros is pretty irrelevant. I run this little dude at 2 as it grants me more plays later in the game and gives my Foolish Burial an extra target.</li>
 	<li><strong>Barrier Statue Of The Torrent. </strong>- This is our lock out monster. He has a continous effect that prevents both players from special summoning anything but water monsters, by the time this is out I dont need the very few monsters in my extra deck that aren't water so this doesnt hinder me in the slightest. However my opponent will be forced alot of the time to summon a monster and skip their MP1 to get rid of the Torrent. Torrent is also super easy to summon once he is sent to the grave by any means as Marincess Coral Anemone can special summon it due its attack being sub 1500. This is usually how i get the Barrier Statue out on the field.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bluebeard, The Plunder Patrol Shipwright. </strong>- This Card could be deemed my signature for this deck as I have never seen any lists, or any other player use it. I will admit its a little cruedly placed in the deck but I promise you there is a reason. His effect activates when he is <em>sent</em> to the grave from the field or monster zone. When he is sent he can discard <em>for cost</em> another card from the hand to draw 1 card. If the sent card is Dragoons you cycle through your deck that much faster at a +0 card advantage. having this effect means that I can essentially trigger Atlantean effects with a Swap Frog by sending the Bluebeard as the discard. The rest of his effects are Plunder Patrol based and arent useful to this deck in the slightest, I may play around with having a second Bluebeard at some point but for now I am running him at 2 to avoid bricks and I just dont have enough space to put another in. Love this card.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Spells:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>One For One.</strong> - OFO is in essence another Neptabyss summoner however it can be used on Fishborg Launcher too and in the OCG this card is also useful to summon Crystal Girl which will be going in the deck when that gets released. Ditching Bluebeard will trigger it. Run 1 cause its limited...</li>
 	<li><strong>Moray Of Greed. </strong>- Moray Of Greed is my draw power of the deck and it allows me to send unwanted water monsters from hand back to the deck. It is a +0 draw power. that just means it cycles through the deck well but not great. Running these at 3 because they <em>are </em>good cards no doubt no doubt.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pot Of Avarice. </strong>- Avarice is a brilliant card to draw after first turn. and its also a great card to have first turn with Moulinglacia having the same requirements that Avarice does. I dont have enough space to put a second Pot in as it would throw off the consistancy.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foolish Burial.</strong> - Used to chuck 3 targets into the grave and if none of those 3 aren't in the deck when you activate this card so you can thin out the deck for your next draw.</li>
 	<li><strong>Abyss-scalle Of The Mizuchi. </strong>- Gives Mermails it is attached to a boost of 800. I usually use this card on Mermail Abyssalacia unless im going for an OTK with Megalo. This card also has a mandatory effect to negate your opponents first spell that is play but will be destroyed doing so. This effect doesn't destroy so field and continous spell effects are still going to be on the field. Field spells are worse to deal with as most of there effects are activated once the card is on the field.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Extra Deck:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Trishula, Dragon of Icy Imprisonment. </strong>- I use this card to go into True King of All Calamaties due to it being a level 9. Thats all this card is value wise to me. Its a level 9 monster that I can summon by banishing any 3 monsters on the field that I wont use. Linkross and a linkross token gets me 2 different monsters, so that leaves 1 monster left to banish. As long as you synchro one of the two lvl9's (preferably Ravenous Crocodragon if you know your opponents hand is free of hand traps) before you play Linkross you will also have a Fishborg Launcher to summon back then banish that fishborg because it would be banished anyway. That way you don't banish a 4th monster that is unnecessarily banished. Running only 1 because of how steep the summoning cost is.</li>
 	<li><strong>Trishula, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier.</strong> - Another lvl9 synchro monster used for multiple thhings. When it is summoned you can Banish 1 card from your opponents hand, GY and field. This does not target cards meaning it is a great out to Avramax and other troublesome monsters that can't be targeted or destroyed. Seeing as it rips 1 card from the hand paired with Moulinglacia, your opponent will start with 3 cards in hand to play with.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ravenous Crocodragon.</strong> - Again its another lvl9 except it has many more uses than the other 2. Because its a lvl9 it can be xyz material for Calamaties or use its effects to gain an advantage over the opponent. When he is synchro summoned he can draw cards equal to the amount of non-tuner synchro materials used for the summon. This trigger effect can give you more resources to play on, or keep them to deal with your opponents counter plays. The second effect of Crocodragon is a destruction quick effect that requires the discard of 2 cards (as cost) from the hand to destroy 1 card on the field. Running 1 because lvl9's are hard to summon.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adamancipator Risen - Dragite.</strong> -  This lvl8 synchro is another card that we only use half of its full effect because it isn't as generic as other cards. The effect we do use is a negation effect for spell or traps once per turn. Besides the negation its a 3000 atk beater. I only need to run 1 of these as it is a hard once per turn negate (no need for multiple on the field) and they are hard to get the resources to summon. Use this card if you are going 1st.</li>
 	<li><strong>White Aura Whale.</strong> - Another lvl8 synchro with an effect we can fully utilise in this deck and none other! its requirements are stiff for most decks but not a water deck. When this card is synchro summoned it can destroy all face-up attack position monsters your opponent controls. Great destruction effect for clearing large boards your opponent has. His other effect is a revival effect which can be used to prevent damage to your face by summoning in defense. This card is great for clearing boards even when the opponent builds a new board due to its 2800 atk and piercing battle damage. Use this card if your opponent goes first and sets up a board.</li>
 	<li><strong>Brionac, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier. </strong>- Another useful card going 2nd to clear boards and trigger Atlantean effects. This cards attack isn't anything to ride home about so isnt often used for attacking other monsters.</li>
 	<li><strong>True King Of All Calamaties.</strong> - The best combo in this deck ends on this card and 3 cards ripped from the opponents hand. VFD negates monster effects your opponent controls stopping their combos before they can react. With 3000 atk and 3000 def VFD is an amzzing card to special summon in defense as most monster will struggle to get over it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bahamut Shark. </strong>- A rank 4 xyz that summons Toadally Awesome and can then be linked off as a water material. I only use 1 of these because the deck doesnt churn out lvl4's all too often.</li>
 	<li><strong>Toadally Awesome. </strong>- Best hand trap counter. Due to the lack of frogs Toadally Awesome can't use his effect to special summon more targets for his negate effect but he can send; Gameciel, Gunde and Barrier Statue Torrent. When Toadally Awesome is sent to the grave he can add 1 water monster from the grave to the hand, this can be used to recycle extra deck monsters and Teus as it cannot be searched by any of our cards but Mermail Abyssalacia. I run 2 copies as 1 can be summoned by Bahamut Shark and 1 can be summoned by Swap Frog and Ronintoadin.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Marbled Rock.</strong> - This card can be used with the 4 side deck Marincess cards to make a 4500 atk unaffected card. Which is fun! Based on the main deck however Marbled Rock is used for recursion of Coral Anemone and is part of the ""Marincess Loop"".</li>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Coral Anemone.</strong> - 1 of the better link monsters in the extra deck with a recursion that special summons any 21/33 of the monsters in the deck including Barrier Statue Torrent for the Lock of your opponents special summon. This card is also able to recycle Marincess Marbled Rock for the ""Marincess Loop"".</li>
 	<li><strong>Mermail Abyssalacia.</strong> - Link-2 that searches any Mermail monster from deck by sending (for cost) a water monsterfrom hand to grave. This cards second effect sends (for cost) a water monster from deck to special summon a water monster from grave. Usually used to special summon Teus, White Aura Whale or any other heavy hitters.</li>
 	<li><strong>Crystron Halqifibrax.</strong> - Starts the synchro plays and can be summoned multiple ways usually via (Diva + Neptabyss) or (Neptabyss + Lappis). Halq can be used to counter Mystic Mine with a side in of T.G. Wonder Magician by chaining Halq's banish effect.</li>
 	<li><strong>Linkross. </strong>- This card has 1 singular use and that is to be used as banish materials for Trishula, Dragon Of Icy Imprisonment.</li>
</ul>
Side Deck:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Sea Horse.</strong> - Used as an extender and as a secondary target for Marincess Marbled Rocks recycle effect. This cards is part of the ""Unaffected Rock"" combo.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Battle Ocean.</strong> - This card gives Marbled Rock its bonus to its attack and make it unaffected in the combo.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Sea Angel. </strong>- part of the ""unaffected Rock"" combo</li>
 	<li><strong>Marincess Crystal Heart.</strong> -  part of the ""unaffected Rock"" combo</li>
 	<li><strong>Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood. </strong>- This card is only used against decks that special summon and only in the 3rd round and only in timed matches. so that you can win by life points at time. Its a very cheeky way of winning but its funny.</li>
 	<li><strong>T.G. Wonder Magician. </strong>- Sided in against mystic mine as a counter to the field spell.</li>
 	<li><strong>Dark Ruler No More.</strong> - sided against strong board makers so you can make a field of your own to destroy theirs paired with gameciels its 6 ways to get rid of their field.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cosmic Cyclone.</strong> - side in against spell and trap decks / fluffals</li>
</ul>

Fe,"It's difficult to tie charmers down to a specific strategy because it seems they are all over the place and don't have one defining style. This deck is a real life deck I plan to use and play in a casual setting when I finally get these cards. Thought I'd share some of my theorycrafting with everyone else who plans to play Charmers!

In this deck I tried to bring several spellcasters together with 1500DEF make use of the charmer spell/traps cards such as <strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</strong> (OPT monster negate), <strong>Unpossessed</strong> (Summon from deck) and <strong>Teamwork of the Unpossessed</strong> (Reborn + Non-Target Destruction).

<strong>Angraecum Umbrella</strong> is for level 7 synchro plays mostly for <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>, a self-resurrecting 3200ATK spellcaster. <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> are for monsters hard to remove.

A <strong>Dogmatika</strong> <strong>(Ecclesia, Theo, Punishment and N'Tss)</strong> engine is added (I didn't include Nadir Servant, it's too expensive. I'll add it one day when it's cheaper T_T.) 1500DEF Dogmatika spellcasters are added to synergize with Charmer S/T. Fortune Lady Every can be sent to the graveyard with Dogmatika cards and cheated out to the field without synchro summoning because it can resurrect itself easily.

<strong>Terraforming, Metaverse</strong> and <strong>Set Rotation</strong> search for our strongest Charmer card, <strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</strong>, which sets up a OPT monster negate with most of our spellcaster monsters. <strong>Secret Village of Spellcasters</strong> is also searchable as a control option for shutting down your opponent's spells.

<strong>Mind Control</strong> and <strong>Brain Control</strong> is added to provide link material from your opponent's field to the matching attribute Charmer, providing a form of removal and a way to resurrect your opponent's monster to your side of the field to link climb into Selene. (This can be cut if you feel first if you want to run handtraps or if you feel the deck is too big).

A link combo I've been experimenting on ends on an untargetable and un-destroyable <strong>Avramax    </strong> <em>or   </em> an unaffected 5000ATK <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon</strong>, and only requires a Link Charmer to summon a monster from an opponent's graveyard to link climb into<strong> Selene, Queen of Master Magicians.</strong>

Example:

1. For this example, we will use <strong>Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</strong> -&gt; Summons from opponent's graveyard their fire monster (ex. Ash Blossom or Almiraj). Link climb to<strong> Selene, Queen of Master Magicians.</strong>
2. <strong>Selene, Queen of Master Magicians </strong>-&gt; Resurrects any spellcaster in face up defense position. Make sure you meet the requirements to fulfill Selene's effect!
3. Link away <strong>Selene, Queen of Master Magicians </strong>-&gt; <strong>Linkross</strong>. Summon 3 Linkross Tokens with Linkross' effect.
4.  If you plan to make un-destroyable link 4 boss monster, link away two Linkross Tokens into <strong>I:P Masqurena,</strong> then link up to a link 4 like<strong> Avramax.</strong> Otherwise, link away five monsters on the field (Linkross, 3 Linkross Tokens, and the resurrected spellcaster) into <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon.</strong>

Other generic boss link monsters such as Apollousa, The Bow of the Godess, Borrelsword Dragon or even Unchained Abomination can be summoned with this combo. I just happen to use Five-Headed Link Dragon and Avramax because they're my favourites.

The win conditions in this deck are our generic boss Link monsters, <strong>Five-Headed Link Dragon</strong> or <strong>Avramax</strong>. Also, this deck can play a mean grind game with <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. As this deck works towards these monsters, you have some control, destruction, and removal options. Overall, this deck is meant for casual duels, and it isn't too strong. One day, maybe there will be a way to break this deck and make it absolutely broken. For now, we'll enjoy casual duels with Charmers! :)"

-Put the card you drew on top of the deck to summon <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> from the GY.

-Banish 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK monster from your GY to summon <a data-name=""Chaos Betrayer"">Chaos Betrayer</a> from the GY.

-Use Plaguespreader Zombie and Chaos Betrayer to summon Borreload Savage Dragon. Equip Saryuja Skull Dread to it.

Deck Breakdown:

Main Deck:

-<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>--<a data-name=""&quot;Infernoble Arms - Durendal&quot;"">""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""</a>: These cards focus on getting Isolde up as consistently as possible. I included 3 <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphins</a> because you will want to use its effect as much as possible, to remove any hand traps your opponent may have, and it can make Isolde with any warrior that can be Special Summoned.

-<a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a>--<a data-name=""Chaos Betrayer"">Chaos Betrayer</a>: These cards are part of the main combo, as detailed above.

-<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>--<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: These cards are used to counter anything that might threaten the combo.  They can be changed out based on the current meta &amp; personal budget.

Extra Deck:

-<a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>: This is the best Warrior I could find that can be summoned with Instant Fusion., with the ability to flip an opponent's monster face-down.

-Everything else: These cards are part of the combo. I have a second Isolde in case the first one gets negated by <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Gamma</a> or <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis"">Fleurdelis</a><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">.</a>

Side deck: These cards are useful against a variety of decks, and can be switched based on the meta &amp; your budget. More info on them below.

Support Cards:

-<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Useful against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">A</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">sh Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.

-<a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a>: This card can stop any specific card that poses a threat to the combo, unless it is already on the field.

-<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: Good for stopping other combo decks, or <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Gamma</a>. Will also be good to have when/if we get <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>.

-<a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a>: Good for stopping on-theme traps from Eldlich and Dogmatika, as well as <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Impermanence</a>.

-<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>: Can clear all but 1 card going second, or at least force a negate. Most effective against Eldlich decks, and may be sided against other matchups.

Side Deck:

-<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>: Good removal against many Spell/Trap-based decks.

-<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>: Shuts down combo decks, but relatively ineffective in other matchups.

-<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>: Destroys opponent's entire backrow, staple against Spell/Trap based decks. You do not need to worry about the Eldlixer/Golden Land GY effects because your opponent will not have another turn to play them on.

-PSY-Framegear Gamma: Good for stopping an opponent's combo, or to stop <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich from being summoned</a>.  May also work well in main deck.

-<a data-name=""Gameciel the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>: Good one-card removal, can be replaced based on the decks you expect to face.

-<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence: "">: Good negation, but not budget-friendly. Can easily be replaced with </a><a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence: "">.</a>

<p><span><b>Before Crystron Halqifibrax</b></span>&lt;!--more--&gt;There are probably 2 simpler and more common ways to do this, summoning 2 tuners, and this can be done using the second normal of <a data-name=""Mausoleum of White"">Mausoleum of White</a> Or using <a data-name=""Protector with Eyes of Blue"">Protector with Eyes of Blue</a>. The 2nd way is by <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon</a> + any tuner.</p>
<p><i>Also there are always common alternative ways, that allow us to have an extra monster, in addition to the materials for Halqifibrax.</i></p>
<b><i>Fibrax + 1 Monster can be lev.8 or 1</i></b>: Normal Summon <a data-name=""Sage with Eyes of Blue"">Sage with Eyes of Blue</a> search <a data-name=""Maiden with Eyes of Blue"">Maiden with Eyes of Blue</a> which is normal summoned thanks to <a data-name=""Mausoleum of White"">Mausoleum of White</a>, then we activate the field effect that targets maiden and send <a data-name=""Dragon Core Hexer"">Dragon Core Hexer</a> from the deck to the graveyard, in this way the maiden effect is activated, which allows us to summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> from hand, deck or graveyard.

<hr />

<i><b>Fibrax + 1 monster lev. 8</b></i>: Normal summon <a data-name=""Protector with Eyes of Blue"">Protector with Eyes of Blue</a> and special summon <a data-name=""Maiden with Eyes of Blue"">Maiden with Eyes of Blue</a> from the hand, then, we activate the protector effect to summon <a data-name=""blue-eyes white dragon"">blue-eyes white dragon</a> from the hand, by destroying the Maiden which, having been targeted, makes us summon a <a data-name=""blue-eyes white dragon"">blue-eyes white dragon</a> from the hand, deck or graveyard.
<p>There are other ways that even make us summon 2 level 8 in addition to fibrex, but require more cards and therefore are not always possible. so I will not explain them to you so as not to lengthen the text too much, in addition to the fact that you yourself can understand very well how to do it</p>

We summon <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> by banishing 3 light monsters so as to summon a level 8 dragon from the graveyard. We summon <a data-name=""guardragon pisty"">guardragon pisty</a> with which we recover a banished monster, then we summon <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> with which we summon from our hand, <a data-name=""Dragon Core Hexer"">Dragon Core Hexer</a> with which we summon <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a>, which allows us to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>. Then thanks to the eyes of blue spellcasters we summon the 8 levels necessary to summon the 2 xyz rank 8, <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> and <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</a>.

The deck struggles to keep up with the times as far as stability is concerned, in fact with adversary negatives, the deck is unable to move forward, and this is strange because it has several starter cards, but they depend a little too much on normal and / or therefore also on <a data-name=""Mausoleum of White"">Mausoleum of White</a>. There is a lack of useful Main supports but they are not coming. It’s a deck that currently if used, it is played with other decks such as Danger! or Rokket but which I don't like because they don't reflect true Blue-Eyes. It is a deck that, although it follows the usual combo we are used to by now and that personally has also tired me, remains a fun deck to play. Hindered a LOT by the extra 15-card deck of which most of the slots are occupied by cards that are used exclusively for the combo. Even with these problems and doubts, the deck pleasantly surprised me, even managing a combo denied to hold on and do something.

<a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> is great side card 'cause it's a dragon monster target of <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a> and allows you to draw 1 or more cards and is can be used at the end of the board as an extra negation.

<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> is the perfect going second card against combo decks, because it allows us to do whatever we want without interruption.

<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> which, if desired, can very well be replaced by <a data-name=""Twin Twister"">Twin Twister</a> which against some decks is even better, are fundamental cards to destroy and in some cases negate, spell cards or annoying traps of our opponent.

<a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> as drnm is used to not have interruptions, but it is a card that can also be used going first, which we mainly use against deck controls, which have more than one trap.

<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> is a card that should be played on the Main Deck, but which I could not find a place for, as well as protecting us from an opponent's attack, it can be useful at the beginning of the combo.

<a data-name=""Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon"">Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon</a> is above all an archetype card that I regret not being able to find a place, because it’s really useful for defending our dragons, as well as giving more sense to <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon</a> which allows us to summon even in the opponent's turn. azure-eyes or other Light Synchro Dragon . Which, with the current extra deck it cannot do because it has no one to summon.

<a data-name=""CloudeCastle"">CloudeCastle</a> + <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>, Calamities is one of the most broken cards in the game at the moment and being able to play it in this deck is great, even if it's not an easy thing, since we should have a synchro lev. 9 to the gy and summon cloudcastle.

<hr />
<p><b>Other cards that may be useful:</b></p>
<a data-name=""Nebula Dragon"">Nebula Dragon</a>, the second copy of this card, honestly I don't think it can be who knows how useful, since if we want to use it, we cannot summon our spellcasters in any way. So it's only useful maybe in our second round or if we're in bad shape and that's the only thing we can do.

<a data-name=""Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"">Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</a> is a card that we can summon thanks to the <a data-name=""blue-eyes spirit Dragon"">blue-eyes spirit Dragon</a>, which returns an opponent's monster to the hand. And it can be used in conjunction with a tuner to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a><a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">.</a>

Theologia also allows Magistus as an engine. Easy Apol","LET'S GO!

Main concept here is to play regular pendulum spellcaster good stuff (Pend Magician, Majespecter, and Endymion) while having access to Magistus via 3 Theologia, 3 Verre, and Magistus Endymion. There's no streamlined combo, you gotta work with what you draw. <strong>Need a lot of practice to gain full advantage on each hand you draw</strong>. The Theologia route is the most common way to access Magistus, any random low lv spellcaster can be an Artemis which you can slap Theologia on for another Artemis but as equip to search Verre. Verre can be pend summoned to search fusion spell for Aiwass. To extend the play, pend lineup comes in handy. Usually we use Cross-Sheep (Aiwass can trigger it) and Selene (best link climber).

Magistus: 3 Theologia and Verre (best cards), 1 each Magistus Endymion (Spell Power Mastery another target and Artemis equip access), Magistus Invocation (combo piece), Vritra (Verre another target, dead if drawn double of it with no Magistus in GY).

Pend Magician: Harmonizing, 3 Duelist Alliance, and Pendulum Call (best cards). Dragonpulse (Dai, Harmonizing, and Call target while being low lv for Artemis), White Wing (same reason and is a wind spellcaster for Majespecter), and Chronograph-Timegazer. Double Iris is there as another Duelist Alliance and Call target.

Majespecter: 3 Bunbuku (best card), 1 each of Kyubi, Ogama, and Tornado. We dont play the Majespecter spell lineup because of scaling problem. Yata, the spell searcher has same 5 scale with Ogama while Kyubi is scale 2 giving Bunbuku versatility. The spells also cant be used going first which means cant help Servant Endymion anyway.

Endymion: 3 Spell Power, 1 Servant (low lv for Artemis and wind spellcaster for Majespecter), 1 Mighty Master (free spell negation), 1 Magister Endymion (another servant target, low lv for Artemis, and has good scale). We dont run Jackal King as it has bad scale and monster negation is covered by Apollousa already (doesnt prevent Nibiru tho).

The rest of it is just good spells for Servant spell counter and Selene requirement like Spellbook engine (insta 2 spells), Unexpected Dai (free Artemis), Instant Fusion (free Artemis while triggering Cross-Sheep), Upstart, and Called by the Grave.

Extra deck is combo pieces with generic stuff. 3 Artemis (as spare, we use 2 in first turn), 2 Selene (combo piece and Accesscode follow-up), Masq (low effort interruption), Crowley (for plus).

Side deck depends on matchup.

&nbsp;

Pros: Best deck. Majespecter is immune to Impermanence and Veiler.

Cons: Pend mechanic bad, need cards to put in scale and pend summon from extra deck is limited by extra/link zone. UNBAN KIRIN."

Series, yet it doesn't seem to be able to compete with today's meta decks.  In this HERO build, we will explore on how can this deck will be able to compete or (hopefully) beat with today's meta.

The main starter for this build is <em>Vision HERO Faris</em>, with this card in your hand including 1 any other HERO monster will surely bring you victory considering your opponent doesn't have any negation. Even if you didn't draw this card, have no worries because there are many searchers in this deck that can lead you to this card. <em>Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</em>, <em>Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</em>, and<em> Elemental HERO Stratos</em> can search for your main starter. Wait, there's more, this additional cards can also help you search for you missing HERO cards <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em>, <em>Fusion Destiny</em>, <em>E-Emergency Call</em>, and <em>A Hero Lives</em>. With that many cards as your searcher, have no doubt that <em>Vision HERO Faris</em> will be in your hands most of the time

One of the most important thing to keep in mind is that you should always bait your opponent's negation so you can execute your combo without distraction. These cards are going to be your bait cards: <em>A Hero Lives</em>, <em>E-Emergency Call</em>, <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em>, <em>Lightning Storm</em>, <em>Elemental HERO Stratos</em>, <em>Foolish Burial</em>, and F<em>orbidden Droplet</em>. When you successfully baited your opponent, their board will be gone in no time and game will be finished in your favor

So this is going to be your main combo:
<ul>
 	<li>1. Use <em>Faris</em>' effect to discard <em>Malicious</em> or <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY</li>
 	<li>1.1 If you discarded <em>Shadow Mist</em>, always chain link 1 shadow mist then chain link 2 <em>Faris</em> to prevent <em>Shadow Mist</em> from being negated by <em>Ash Blossom</em></li>
 	<li>1.1.1 Using <em>Shadow Mist</em>'s effect search for<em> Evil HERO Adusted Gold</em></li>
 	<li>2. Use <em>Faris</em>' effect to place <em>Vision HERO Increase</em> to the spell/trap zone</li>
 	<li>3. Use <em>Incease'</em>s effect to send <em>Faris</em> to the GY, then special summon <em>Vision HERO Vyon</em> to the field, activate <em>Vyon</em>'s effect to send a copy of<em> Malicious</em> or <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY (whoever is the one you didn't discard from Faris' effect)</li>
 	<li>3.1 If you sent <em>Shadow Mist</em> to the GY, activate it's effect to search for <em>Evil HERO Adusted Gold</em></li>
 	<li>4. Use <em>Vyon</em>'s second effect, banish <em>Shadow Mist</em> to search for a copy of <em>Polymerization</em></li>
 	<li>5. Link summon <em>Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</em> using <em>Increase</em> and <em>Vyon,</em> then use <em>Crusader</em>'s effect to special summon <em>Malicious</em> from the GY, activate <em>Crusader</em>'s second effect to tribute <em>Malicious</em> then search for<em> Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</em></li>
 	<li>6. Use <em>Adusted Gold</em>'s effect to search for <em>Dark Calling</em></li>
 	<li>7. Use <em>Malicious</em> effect in the GY to special summon another copy of itself from the deck</li>
 	<li>8. Fusion Summon <em>Elemental HERO Sunrise</em> using <em>Malicious</em> and<em> Liquid Soldier</em>, always chain link 1 <em>Liquid Soldier</em> then chain link 2<em> Sunrise</em></li>
 	<li>9. Through <em>Sunrise</em>'s effect you can search a copy of <em>Miracle Fusion</em>, use this to fusion Summon <em>Elemental HERO Escuridao</em>.</li>
 	<li>10. Activate <em>Dark Calling</em> to fusion summon <em>Evil HERO Malicious Bane</em> (as much as possible banish monster's that are not Destiny HERO, since you can still use them through the second copy of <em>Cross Crusader</em> in the Extra Deck)</li>
</ul>
Purpose of Side Deck Cards
<ul>
 	<li><em>Nibiru, The Primal Being</em> - Good against pure going 1st decks like zefra, infernoble knights, megalith, etc.</li>
 	<li><em>Dinowrestler Pankratops</em> - Good against anti-meta decks and backrow decks</li>
 	<li><em>Artifact Lancea</em> - Good against Invoked, Dogmatika, and Banish decks</li>
 	<li><em>Mask Change</em> - If you're forced to be going 1st against certain type of decks, siding this in will give you a higher chance to have <em>Dark Law</em> or perform the <em>Absolute Zero</em> to <em>Acid</em> combo</li>
 	<li><em>Forbidden Droplet</em> - Good against going 1st decks, side this in then take out 1 <em>Mask Change</em></li>
 	<li><em>Prohibition</em> - Pretty Spicy card that i put in here (At first I was planning to use <em>Crossout Designator</em> but due to being bricky, I decided to use <em>Prohibition</em>) always call <em>Nibiru</em> when using this card unless you're pretty sure that you're opponent doesn't have one. If you're opponent doesn't have one you can just call a keypiece to his combo.</li>
 	<li><em>Vanity's Emptiness</em> - Pretty self explanatory card, great card against combo decks.</li>
 	<li><em>Anti-Spell Fragrance</em> - This card is just a less broken version of Imperial Order</li>
 	<li><em>Imperial Order</em> - Broken card against especially against Sky Striker</li>
 	<li><em>Red Reboot</em> - Since we're using an OTK Deck this card is a must</li>
</ul>
Things to remember:
<ul>
 	<li>If your opponent uses a targeting negate to your monster, you can chain mask change, <em>Vision HERO Increase</em>, or <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> to dodge the negation.</li>
 	<li>Always chain <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> to any of your bait cards in order to force your opponent to activate the negation. Example: You activate <em>A Hero Lives</em> then your opponent chains <em>Borreload Savage Dragon</em>, you can chain f<em>orbidden droplet</em> to send <em>A HERO Lives</em> from your field to the graveyard in order to prevent it's effect being negated</li>
 	<li>When using <em>Vision HERO Faris</em>' effect, always discard <em>Destiny HERO - Malicious</em> or <em>Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</em> (Though it's more preferable to discard <em>Malicious</em>) so that you can trigger their effect in the graveyard. <em>Malicious</em> is more preferable to discard since if<em> Faris</em>' effect has been negated you can still use <em>Maliciou</em>s' effect to summon another copy of it from the deck then Link Summon Xtra HERO Cross Crusader.</li>
 	<li><em>Fusion Destiny</em> is the last bait card that you should use due to it's restriction that you will be limited that you can only special summon Dark Hero Monster on the whole turn (I prefer to use this card as a last resort if <em>Faris</em> has been negated, in that way you can still put up a decent board).</li>

Or maybe you're a new player and missed out on the reign of terror that was the Destiny Hero engine. Well strap in, because this is gonna be a blast from the past!

I won't lie to you, much of this deck's strength comes from leveraging the extremely easy access it has to Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. It's the central play of the deck. We have a ton of chains that can end with positive value leading into a Verte Anaconda to set up your powerhouse boss monster.

Starting the game with any line into a Malicious into the GY gives you easy access to a Link 2 monster. Doing so with Dark Grepher, Armageddon Knight, or a Stratos into D-Draw will leave you with 2 warriors on the field, letting you link into Isolde. This is the best way to start the game, so if you have a line to get to an early Isolde that is where we begin.

Isolde then can grab you any card, generally I go for Disk Commander since he's the monster I'm the least likely to need access to later in the turn. Isolde can then dump ideally 4 equipment to special summon Stratos to then grab another card from the deck. If you've drawn into one of your equipment already, just summon whoever you can instead. Now you're back to 2 monsters and can Link into Verte Anaconda and summon your Dragoon. Isolde also conveniently sets up Divine Sword Phoenix Blade for you to get back and have a free pitch to your Dragoon every turn!

Now, that's the most basic line. If you find a way to get to 4 monsters in play (not too tall an order with all the special summons available to the deck), you can also go into Skull Dread for some extra value and then Link into Anaconda. Skull Dread is also excellent to get into play due to all of the effects we have that want cards in the deck, which he can help fix if we draw too many.

Cross-Sheep can also be accessed before going into Anaconda if you've gone 2nd and have access to Instant Fusion. This also gives an easy way into a Skull Dread link summon.

Doom Lord gives you another D-Draw target as well as a level 3 to find with Isolde. He's also lowkey pretty good on his own, getting around a lot of problematic cards."

&nbsp;
<h6>Board #1 <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> + <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes D. Dragoon</a> + Backrow:</h6>
Typical Salamangreat setup using <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> that usually requires either <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> or <a data-name=""Will of the Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a> to SS <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>.
<h6>Board #2 Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf + <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Buster Lock</a> + Backrow:</h6>
Same Salamangreat setup with Salamangreat Gazelle. For this setup, instead of Link Summoning Predaplant Verte Anaconda you will go into <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>. You'll need one additional Cyberse on the field than you need for Board #1 to Link Summon <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to equip the <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a> to. A Buster Lock will be better against ED-heavy Decks than Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon but since it's not a consistent endboard you could instead end it on Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf + <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Bagooska</a> + Backrow.
<h6>Board #3: Red-Eyes D. Dragoon + Buster Lock:</h6>
This is were this deck becomes more consistent. Sometimes you either won't be able to summon Salamangreat Gazelle to access your backrow or a Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Roar"">Roar</a> or <a data-name=""Salamangreat Rage"">Rage</a> alone just won't be enough to stop your opponent. This setup works without Salamangreat Gazelle. Instead of going into Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf you go straight into Union Carrier and then use your extenders to SS Predaplant Verte Anaconda, equip Dragon Buster Destruction Sword to Predaplant Verte Anaconda and SS Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.

&nbsp;
<h6>Miscellaneous:</h6>
I play 3 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> since Dragoon is easily splashable and even if your opponent doesn't play him this card is still a great way to deal with an already established board (especially combo deck boards) using <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>.

You still have your typical OTK as a win condition using <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. Accesscode Talker can be swapped for <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>.

The afore mentioned boards aren't highly consistent and are rather a show of what an endboard with this Salamangreat deck could look like. There's a plethora of other board states you could pass your turn with including everyone's favorite: hard drawing Red-Eyes Fusion to SS Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and pass   like drawing handtraps and Parallel eXceeds only   for example having your Salamangreat Gazelle Ash'ed or your NS's effect Ghost Ogre'd with little to no follow-up  ."

Grind your opponent out or quickly dispatch their life points with a swift Double Summon turn.

Trade with everything your opponent tries to do and you will end up with more cards left with all of you +1's. Hand traps galore, as well as more traditional forms of board interaction. Pair this with a massive toolbox of some of the best XYZ monsters in the game and you've got a formula for a potent anti-meta deck.

42 cards is the classic formula for a 6 gadget deck. It gives you the most consistency while also helping to spread your gadgets out more."

The last way to get Venus is summoning Cherubini and using Succession or Monster Reborn. You have plenty of free level 3's (Dai, E-tele, Dangers), then draconnet and chosen to make her, and can potentially search the succession and summon a chosen if you can already do the World Chalice combo.

So, discarding LV5 gets you lV7, which discarding that gets LV3, or gets Flash (if you didnt use it to start) to start your link combos. If you discard LV7 first you can get LV5 and then get Tempest. Gusto Griffin is your other best discard to summon itself and make Romulus

Artillery Catapult Turtle lets you get a LV5 on field to start your combos, but can also get Gaia the Magical Knight to summon the LV5 back from grave if you get it there first. Gaia is level 7 for an easy synchro.

Lightning is your best starter. It will trigger your Armed Dragons (or Gusto, which is the easiest way to full combo) when summoning Tempest, and will also set up the grave to summon Tempest again with his own effect. Opening Darkness Metal will even let you banish Tempest to search any Armed Dragon. Tempest can also search Darkness Metal, by discarding a card you want too!

Effect Veiler can be a surprisingly good normal summon, to make your Level 8 synchros at the end of your combo, or once Tempest is summoning itself every turn.

&nbsp;

Basically the combo goes:

Romulus &gt; ss Phalanx&gt; Linkross &gt; Martial metal&gt; summon back Phalanx &gt; (herald here if u want) &gt; Halqifibrax &gt; ss Rokket Synchron or Effect Veiler&gt; (make formula synchron if you didn't make Herald)

then it kinda varies. If I drew Guardragon I usually activate it here to get something for elpy then move it to get Darkness Metal and 1 more dragon for Saryuja. (Tempest can also be the better card to get off Elpy, for easy Level 8 synchros, especially since it will come back every turn.)

If you don't have Guardragon, it's usually best to go for Formula Synchron, because you need one more extender to make Saryuja with four.

If Saryuja draws you Armed Dragon LV7, summoning it here is the very best way to get to LV10, (NOTE: If you have Herald you can NOT discard to summon LV10) especially since it usually draws you a good discard for it too, or another quick launch (btw Reasoning is a 7th quick launch 80% often)

From here Saryuja's arrows let you use Elpy to get a low level or Darkness Metal (if you didn't already) for Pisty, and Pisty usually gets either a Rokket Synchron or a Level 7, but can also revive Romulus to get you one more link material for an Apollousa. (Try to save Tempest's revive for around here to make your synchro)

Once you use your Guardragons, use Protector Whelp to link them off. You can then finally Link that and Saryuja for Union Carrier. This is the best time to make Borreload Savage, so it can equip Saryuja, and then Dragon Buster.

&nbsp;

Uninterupted you can end on Herald, Borreload Savage, Draco Berserker and Buster Lock. or like, LV10, Borrelsavage, 2/3 matt apollousa, and Buster Lock.

Have fun!!!"

This deck is absolutely wild and lots of fun for everyone","I'll start this out by saying that this deck should cost you anywhere from $80 - $130, depending on where you buy your cards from (and this is excluding the side deck recommendations or tech options).

Utopia package in side deck is for whether or not you wish to build the Kali Yuga lockdown variant, in which case you need Utopia Kaiser, Kali Yuga, Big Eye, and Utopia Double+Double or Nothing.

Other than that, go wild. It's better to experiment and find out what build suits your playstyle and/or meta.

PK Fire is a very unique deck that combines the use of the Phantom Knights as an easy level 3 engine that can provide relevant forms of offensive and defensive plays, namely being able to set multiples of one of the best trap cards in the game: Phantom Knights' Fog Blade. On top of this, the Burning Abyss monsters provide an easy link climbing route and can also be utilized for Phantom Knights plays, such as summoning Break Sword and (more relevantly) Rusty Bardiche.

Personally i would like to add dragoon in side and cards like Kaina and apollousa but gottastick with the most meta used.Borrelsword could be nice i guess.I would add triple tactics but desires makes sure you get your cards(unless opponent ash of course).Mind control could be good if you find yourself having trouble link climbing.

The plan is to stop opponent from playing(duh..)with nibiru -there can only be one ,for BA,dragon link,adamancipator,salads.Evenly matched for altergeist as well as lightting storm.Feel free to add MST/twin twisters/cosmic cyclone.Mask of restrict for monarchs.KILL elderich will accencode or if you side dragoon.Every handtrap for numeron really.Dark ruler no  more/droplet for dragoon,kozmo.

Charmers with a splash of orcus"" and you're wondering how could ""Zoodiac Majespector feat. Charmers with a splash of orcus"" work.

<em>it doesn't.</em>

here's my best guess

Step 0: give up save yourself

Step 1: Just say no

as you probably noticed most of the monsters in this deck die if you blink at them so you need to protect them. then you probably noticed that there isn't much to go around in this deck so what do you do? Just say no. Ash blossom and Droll &amp; lock will save you from the turn 1 ftk you deserve to deal with if you're playing with this deck and after that you need to set up the majespecter shuffle. What's that you ask? a loop that let's you lock down you're opponent from playing the game and search your entire deck till you barf xyz's trying to do you're best impressions of all those cool arc types that work.

Step 1 ex1: Set up scales

you need pendulum scales set up to do the shuffle and the ideal monsters for that is cat and frog cause cat is a slow searcher and frog is bad and only there for another 5 scale and as a tornado victim.

Step 1 xe2: have the god damn racoon

you need this stupid racoon to do anything in this dumb arc type including the shuffle cause apparently racoons are great dancers as well as the only thing making this deck function.

Step 1 ex3: WE NEED THE GOD DAMN RACOON'S TRAP CARD TOO DON'T WE

tornado says no to like half of major combo enders and it will be your primary stall tool as you do the shuffle, remember to always kill the racoon with it also remember you're daily dose of ash blossom... well... make you're opponent take their's

Step 1 ex4: get every card

do this over and over until you get fox, crow, supercell, storm and then you finished the majespector shuffle! now spam all the rank 4s you want with all that time you got to set up with zoo! go into beeg hole digger or Wynn, wait she has a link ver!

Step 2: win

great job, you did it. now, bravo. are you happy?"

But this list is both different from the average Trickstar strategy and helps it thrive.

It can be a struggle to resolve Reincarnation+Droll combos, especially with Light Stage to 1, but this list mitigates that issue with the use of Generaider Boss Fight. The ability to summon Harr or Nidhogg in combination with ripping your opponent's entire hand is a powerful tool that the deck can abuse very, very well. Simply opening Droll+Boss Fight+Reincarnation (or any extension that can retrieve these cards), similar to the Reincarnation+Droll combo, will rip your opponent's hand while also establishing an extra negate body on your field. Among other things, cards like Trap Trick only make this more consistent.

However, even without the use of the Droll combo, the Generaider engine provides Trickstar with more board presence and utility than they could ask for. The ability to establish a full board of tokens while also being able to hand rip/negate a card effect with Harr/Nidhogg gives Trickstar room to breathe and be less vulnerable to cards like Lightning Storm or handtraps. If they waste their interaction on Candina or Light Stage, they're still going to have to deal with the Generaider portion and vice versa."

Get access to Eldlich via Black Awakening/Scarlet Sanguine/Cursed Eldland - keep in mind you can only special summon Zombies after that

Get access to Ecclesia via Nadir Servant - keep in mind you can't special summon from the extra deck anymore after activating Nadir Servant or after special summoning ecclesia -&gt; add Fleurdelis to hand via Ecclesia -&gt; summon Fleurdelis during your opponents turn to negate monster effect

Typically you wanna start with Invoked since it has no summoning restrictions, then continue with Eldlich/Dogmatika depending on you starting hand/situation

&nbsp;

Additonal things:

send Titaniklad/Skull Knight/N'tss/Framelord Omega to grave via Dogmatika Maximus to use their grave effects

use 2 Eldlich monsters to overlay into Gustav max after Battle Phase do inflict 2k effect damage if opponent has 2k or less life points

i recommend to summon Secure Gardna only if you want to use it as fusion material since he cant be used as link material and will block your extra monster zone

Rusty provides effect and attack negation, and a weird sort of grind game with 3 Fog Blade, the ability to recover Rust with Fog Blade, while Tri-Gate gets us an omni-negate that banishes. You could make Savage, but since we can banish, I think we should.

Since the pile of bricks was so huge, I wanted to run as many extenders and starters as possible, and I wanted to run 60 cards, hence the Dragonmaid engine. Since I knew the hand trap count would be light, and since I really wanted extenders, I incorporated Phantazmay. Ghost Mourner makes sense in this deck - generic effect negation is just good in the meta right now, and not having Imperm's restrictions makes it better when we're digging for answers with Phantazmay.

Updated the combo, to incorporate Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and Borreload Savage Dragon. Full board is Apollousa with 3 negates, 1 Rusty Bardiche with 1 Fog Blade, Borreload Savage Dragon, and Dragoon. If you can see a single extender, and don't need to burn it, you can extend to 4 negates on Apollousa or a second Fog Blade. With Dragoon, if your combo gets interrupted you can make an emergency Dragoon, but the deck is fully capable of playing through negates."

Before starting to talk about what the deck actually does, I want to clarify two things: First off, this is a Gemini deck, which means that you need to normally summon monsters twice to give them their printed effects; they also count as Normal monsters in the graveyard, which the deck makes use off quite a lot. Secondly, I use a small ""Red-Eyes"" and a small ""Tenyi"" engine to make the deck run smoother; I will further explain what cards I use and for what reasons I use them, but I can tell you from the start that a pure ""Chemicritter"" deck faces a few hurdles that I would rather like to solve with outside support.</p>
<p>Which brings me straight to the deck: The ""Chemicritter"" core consists of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Carbo Crab"">Chemicritter Carbo Crab</a>"", which is both graveyard setup and a searcher as soon as you get its effects live. ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Oxy Ox"">Chemicritter Oxy Ox</a>"" also clocks in at three copies, since it is the most convinient way to get Rank 7 and Rank 8 monsters on the board. ""<a data-name=""Poly-Chemicritter Dioxogre"">Poly-Chemicritter Dioxogre</a>"" is the main beater, who is able to make the summons of Gemini monsters unnegatable while also sporting a removal effect, while the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Poly-Chemicritter Hydragon"">Poly-Chemicritter Hydragon</a>"" is less powerful, but can have uses by boosting and protecting your monsters. You need both to make the most out of the copies of ""<a data-name=""Burnout"">Burnout</a>"" in the deck, which can be very helpful in a pinch while also having a seriously useful effect when banished from the graveyard. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" since you need this Field Spell on the board to make any respectable plays, and while the previous build had both one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>"", I have take them both out in this version due to the new ""Chemicritter"" support card in form of ""<a data-name=""Dimer Synthesis"">Dimer Synthesis</a>"", which is better than the Field Spell searchers by a mile in this deck. The combination of being able to summon Level 5 or higher Gemini monsters without tribute, summon Gemini monsters twice and also have a removal effect at your disposal is very powerful and pretty much needed at any point during the game.</p>
<p>Engine-wise, the ""Red-Eyes"" engine is mostly there to fill the graveyard with revivable monsters. The pure version of ""Chemicritters"" always suffered from not having enough targets in the graveyard to work with, a problem that is easily solved by the ""Red-Eyes"" cards. The main idea is to either draw the single ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"" to search for ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"", or simply start the combo with the Fusion spell. Do not worry if you think that this is simply going to end up in ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>"" again like in pretty much any other deck in existence at the moment: In this deck, the combo is summoning ""<a data-name=""Meteor Black Comet Dragon"">Meteor Black Comet Dragon</a>"" via ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"" by using a ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</a>"" and a copy of ""<a data-name=""Mana Dragon Zirnitron"">Mana Dragon Zirnitron</a>"" from the deck and then using the effect of the Fusion monster to ditch the single ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning"">Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</a>"" for 1250 burn damage and further graveyard setup. If you started by playing ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"", you end up with the Fusion monster and every single ""Red-Eyes"" card in the deck in the graveyard, ready for numerous revival effects to target them. Drawing into the ""Red-Eyes"" monsters is no big deal, since you can use them with ""<a data-name=""Chemicritter Oxy Ox"">Chemicritter Oxy Ox</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" and both of the Main Deck options are rather helpful when their effects go live. Only drawing ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a>"" after using the Fusion Spell has no further use, but that is a small price to pay.</p>
<p>The ""Tenyi"" cards in the deck are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a>"", who combines an easy summoning effects for some swarming, another monster for Rank 7 plays and a handy bounce effect in one card. The deck also runs two copies of ""<a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>"" to stop your opponent from doing certain things to the board. The Extra Deck monster ""<a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>"" is only really in the deck if the opponent triggers the second effect of ""<a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>"", but it can technically be summoned using the normal way aswell. I included a few Gemini support cards, namely ""<a data-name=""Supervise"">Supervise</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Gemini Ablation"">Gemini Ablation</a>"", into the mix since they help the deck with consistency and tempo. The only generic monsters in the deck are ""<a data-name=""Darkstorm Dragon"">Darkstorm Dragon</a>"", who is a technically a ""<a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a>"" on legs and therefore very helpful in certain situations, and ""<a data-name=""Mana Dragon Zirnitron"">Mana Dragon Zirnitron</a>"", a monster that not only serves as Fusion material for ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>"", but also has an extremely helpful summoning condition while also recycling backrow. Since the opponent will try to destroy ""<a data-name=""Catalyst Field"">Catalyst Field</a>"" to slow down the deck, you will often have a chance to summon this monsters and plus off its effect.</p>
<p>The Extra Deck is mostly a colorful mix of options you can use in various situations. The two Fusion monsters I have not talked about so far are ""<a data-name=""Superalloy Beast Raptinus"">Superalloy Beast Raptinus</a>"", who gives all Gemini monsters their effects as long as it is on the field, and ""<a data-name=""First of the Dragons"">First of the Dragons</a>"" who is helpful against deck with a lot of Effect monsters; so all the time, really. They can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Dragon's Mirror"">Dragon's Mirror</a>"", which makes use of the monsters in the graveyard. The Xyz options are the archetypal boss monster ""<a data-name=""Vola-Chemicritter Methydraco"">Vola-Chemicritter Methydraco</a>"" (revive effect, removal and attack/target protection for Gemini monsters), ""<a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>"" (beater with added Spell negate), ""<a data-name=""Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"">Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</a>"" (beater with effect negation, ATK boost and bonus attacks), ""<a data-name=""Thunder End Dragon"">Thunder End Dragon</a>"" (""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" on legs), ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragon</a>"" (burn card with added revive for ""Red-Eyes"" Normal monsters) and ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" (steals the opposing monsters for the cost of one material and ""Big Eye"" attacking in the same turn). ""<a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a>"" is a surprisingly good card that provides attack boosts for your board, lowers the ATK of opposing monsters and revives a non-Effect monster (and therefore, you guessed it, a Gemini monster) from your graveyard when it leaves the field. ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" is handy backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" can help with issues with the Field Spell.</p>
<p>I personally think that ""Chemicritters"" are very fun to play in a more casually-minded environment. The deck has little to no reaction to the opposing plays on its own, but very much likes to just do its own stuff and see how it works out. The problem with Geminis in general is that every monster over Level 5 is a potential brick that you can only really get around by drawing into another copy of your Field Spell. In addition to that, they cannot keep up with decks that carefully manage their resources and will recover cards on a regular basis, since they will run out of cards rather quickly. But despite being Geminis and therefore being the slowest possible summons in the game, the archetype works rather well and is certainly quirky.</p>

I found myself not being able to get 2 monsters on the field without it. The only good normal summon for my pure version was Destiny HERO - Drilldark and I had to have another Destiny HERO in my hand, which isn't that hard but not good enough. Now I added my favorite engine of 3 Predaplant Orphys Scorpio and 1 Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra. 2 monsters on the board AND a free destiny fusion? Doesn't get better than that!

This deck is ever changing. Destiny HEROs are my favorite deck and I just really want to find a way to  break Fusion Destiny and D - Tactics. I have been testing many different versions that I will post inevitably. One of the biggest problems with this deck was that I needed my opponent to destroy my Destiny HERO - Dominance. Most of the time (if my opponent knew what it did) they would just ignore it and OTK me by killing my weaker monsters like Predaplant Verte Anaconda which I HATE leaving on the board. So I looked for a way to just get rid of Anaconda and destroy my own Dominance. That is when I stumbled upon Rapid Trigger. Never have I heard about this card and when I found it I thought it was the perfect card for my deck. I was looking for a quick play fusion card so I could summon Destiny HERO - Dystopia on my opponent's turn to trigger D - Tactics since D - Fusion sucks. So this card lets me fusion summon any monster on my opponents turn by destroying my monsters instead of sending them, triggering Doninance's effect? And it makes them unaffected by monsters summoned from the extra deck on top of that? Sign me up.

Okay so the deck's main strategy is to summon 2 monsters onto the field and make Anaconda. I have a 40 card deck and a lot of draw power in order to find Rapid Trigger and D - Tactics. Hard drawing Fusion Destiny is good because if the opponent negates your normal summon you can play through it. Normally you want to summon Dominance with Fusion Destiny by sending Malicious, Disk Commander, and Dreadmaster. Malicious because you want him in the grave, Disk for draw 2, and Dread for level 8 that when its special summoned Destiny HEROs cannot be destroyed and you take no damage from battles with them. Summon Dystopia with Anaconda by sending Drawhand and Dynatag. Monsters you send always change but those are best choices for both monsters.

For what to summon with Rapid Trigger:
<ul>
 	<li>If its your turn and all you have is Fusion Destiny and 1 Destiny HERO in hand, summon Dusktopia by destroying Dominance and the other monster on the field. You can trigger Dominance's effect and special summon 3 monsters. Link 2 of them into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader and bring back another monster to tribute to search for Destiny HERO - Plasma. Special summon a Malicious from the grave and tribute the Malicious, Cross Crusader, and the other monster for Plasma. You should have a Dusktopia still on the field who can protect Plasma and is partially protected itself from the effect of Rapid Trigger.</li>
 	<li>If its your opponents turn and all you were able to summon was Anaconda and Dominance, summon Predaplant Dragostapelia for 1 monster negate.</li>
 	<li>If its your opponents turn and you have 3 monsters on the field summon Predaplant Triphyoverutum for 1 extra deck special summon negation.</li>

</ul>
Cards to side/take out: Butterspy is an extender that can chainblock, Dreamer can protect from the grave, Dark angel is not that good but is spicy spell negation, Duster and twister for spell destruction (I keep facing Domain Monarchs and Mystic Mine).

Overall its not the most competitive deck but it is spicy and a lot of fun. I don't have any handtraps or other staples in the deck but feel free to add them. I would probably run 3 Called by if it were at 3....."

This deck has been very consistent with several ways to finish the opponent. A mid-tempo deck that should not,"My take on Invoked Shaddoll this format. Hand traps are pretty much staple and you need to be able to stop opponent plays so this deck runs 9 total.

&nbsp;

This deck is pretty straightforward. I know some do not like to run Pot of Avarice however it is very much needed vs any other control/mid-tempo decks to cycle back your Shaddoll fusions once they out all of it. The goal is to lock and/or disrupt opponent plays and when an opportunity arises, you can actually OTK via Purgatrio/Shaddoll Combo with Ariel and Resh/Augoeides. Learning when to use/summon your cards and disruptions pays off with this deck.

&nbsp;

This deck has been very consistent with several ways to finish the opponent. At most, a Mid-tempo deck and should not be in a grind game for too long as it will reduce your resources without any way to recycle them unless you use pot of avarice.
