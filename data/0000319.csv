You can push OTK's very easily, make multiple interruptions first turn, banish your opponennts field up to two times and even have inbuild handtrap mechanics. It also can play around handtraps.</p><p>If you are not familiar with this deck, you need to get into "" Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth"" thorugh making ""Abyss Keeper"" and using it's effect. Alternatively you can specialsummon "" Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth"" by the effect of ""Paces, Light of Ghoti"". If you believe your opponennt has a targeting monster effect negation waiting for you, you can specialsummon one fish-type monster additionally to counter things such like as ""Infinite Impermanence"", ""Effect Veiler"" or ""Forbidden Chalice"". After "" Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth"" resoves you need to specialsummon every other Ghoti-tuner monster and ""Fishborg Launcher"". Then you can make ""White Aura Monoceros"" and go off to the races.&nbsp;</p><p>If you go second and you have ""Zep, Rubin of Ghoti"" and ""Snopios, Shade of Ghoti"", you interrupt your opponennt by using the effect of ""Snopios, Shade of Ghoti"" to banish ""Zep, Rubin of Ghoti"" and one more fish-type monster to special summon both of them. Now you can decide if you want a Raigeki-effect (""White Aura Whale"") or a banish snipe (""Askaan, the Bicorned Ghoti"").&nbsp;</p><p>When ""Paces, Light of Ghoti"" and ""Shif, Fairy of Ghoti"" get banished in your turn, they come back to the field in next Standy Phase. If you have additionally ""Snopios, Shade of Ghoti"" and ""Zep, Rubin of Ghoti"" and one ""Arionpos, Serpent of Ghoti"" on the field, you can make up to two ""Ghoti, Deep Beyond"" in your opponennts turn which means two times field banish.&nbsp;</p><p>Comment if you want me to explain the full combo.

( if you had to pop a card on the field, I would recommend you not pop Presurred planet Wraitsoth but pop the Kashtira unicorn instead, when they tried to use Kashtira theosis cuz they could already have Unicorn on their hand )<br /><br />Will my zones get unlocked if I negate Shangri-lra's effects? well, the effect says, that this card should be face-up on the field to use its effects, doesn't matters if it's negated or not negated.<br /><br />can I tribute my planet pathfinder, after my opponent used Imperm to negate its effect before I use the effect? yes you can, cuz this card tributes for a cost ( this card is really nice, not only a combo starter but it's also a negate baiter )</p><hr /><p>now in this section, we are going to give you the best card names to use against Kashtira and defeat them.<br /><br />evenly matched - book of the eclipse - lava golem - Kurikara ( this card is broken against Kashtira ) - Contact ""C"" ( use this card after they used Kashtira theosis ) - Artifact Lancea - dimensional Barrier&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>how to side in this deck<br /><br />GOING FIRST<br />well we have Iblee + Lancea ( you can run dimensional fissure in your side deck instead if you want to )<br /><br />GOING SECOND<br />well this deck, happens to be one of the best second-going decks<br />you have lava golem + evenly matched + pankratops + lightning storm&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>now that we are over with the list and notes and rulings and siding let's go to the final talk<br /><br />this deck is a strong anti-meta-based deck, it is also one of the annoying decks in-game same as Floowandereeze, personally, i don't like where this game is going in TCG, we are getting more floodgates out, and it's not healthy, don't ever think Floowandereeze lost barrier doesn't means they won't win (apparently, they are using Fossil Dyna with the small world, and some Simorgh cards to extend their floodgate summoning mode), playing Kashtira in the first week when it got released in OCG was fun, but now it doesn't sound fun anymore.<br /><br />well good luck duelists, hope you can enjoy this banish-man format ( if you can find any joy in this Toxic format )<br /><br />See you guys on my deck lists for post-Cyber storm Accel&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>"

Probably because I gave away my cards when I was younger (only had a few somewhat expensive cards, nothing too crazy) and it's one of the few cards I still have from my childhood. So a deck using Flamvell Firedog was the first Edison deck I submitted on this site. It was heavily inspired by another deck (I think/hope I mentioned that. Edit: Yeah I did, at the end) and so is this one. I made a few changes but after a quite gimmicky deck last time I'm happy to say that I think this deck really does it. It's pretty much Diva HERO. It's consistent, has many strong plays and a Spell Card that is way too broken. If you want endorphins, this is how you get them.</p><p>The plan this time is to mill Flamvell monsters with Ryke, Charge and Card Trooper, still with the intent to Normal Summon Firedog to destroy a monster and trigger its effect. Book of Moon is a fantastic, universal tool to help you with that.</p><p>Now every deck I've ever seen plays 3 Flamvell Magician and I never unterstood why. I still don't so I cut it down to two copies. I brick on it much less and it just feels so much better. Occasionally you won't be able to trigger Firedog but who cares, that just means your GY is stacked.</p><p>The Gravekeeper cards help with your board presence, are a removal tool and all have the DARK attribute. This makes summoning Chaos Sorcerer and Dark Armed Dragon quite easy.</p><p>Deck I used for orientation:<a>https://www.edisonformat.com/decks/edison-legends-6th</a></p>"

Spright? they have to try pretty hard to get anything done.</p><p>And last but not least, since this endboard is almost entirely links, you're immune to all of the book of moon-type cards that people are bound to be main-decking for Kashtira!</p><p>But, with all good things, there are the bad. First off, this build has a horrendus matchup vs Kashtira and Labrynth going second. and lastly, Artifact Lancea, Chaos Hunter and Dimension Shitter still rain on your parade, but at least 2 of those 3 also cripple Kashtira!</p><p>So what do ya say? are you willing to take on the challenge? Command these ghostly warriors to your victory!&nbsp;</p>"

But this is the combo: king calamity turbo. Branded etude is such a blessing for resonators (literally what this deck was supposed to do and it can't because it s*cks, but i still love it). I like the idea of playing Branded Regained, but when i tested it seemed much more like a brick than a +1 extender card, but i'll try it again someday. The deck has a few cards that we don't wanna see (4 exactly, but sometimes the engine can deal with them). I would love to read any ideas and your testing results with this build. Thanks</p>"

Dark worlds provide near-infinite discard fodder for your purrely quick plays, as well as link material for an Apollousa or Muckracker, rank 8 material for 38 or 90, or to make a fusion that can negate 1 card, then get rid of 2 cards in the opponent's hand. The Dark worlds also provide a great drawing engine so you can get access to your Purrely quick-play spells without relying on the randomness of <a href=""/card/?search=25550531"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/25550531.jpg"" data-card=""25550531"" data-name=""Purrely"">Purrely (25550531).</span></a> The new Purrely card, <a href=""/card/?search=79933029"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79933029.jpg"" data-card=""79933029"" data-name=""Purrely Lily"">Purrely Lily (79933029)</span></a>, gives a great boost to the deck.

There are pros and cons between using Purrelys in Dark World, and using Dangers in Dark World. Here's some of them.</p><p>Pros:</p><p>Purrely gives control over your discards, where as dark worlds can either win you the game immediately or lose you the game immediately.</p><p>Purrely has amazing access to rank 1 xyz monsters like <a href=""/card/?search=72971064"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/72971064.jpg"" data-card=""72971064"" data-name=""Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin"">Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin (72971064)</span></a>.</p><p>If you don't want to use your purrelys for xyz material, they can still be used as Link Material for Apollousa, I:P, or Muckracker.</p><p>They can set up a 2 or 3-activation Zeus very easily, which can win the game on its own.</p><p>Expurrely Noir is an Arrival Cyberse @Ignister that also can be interuption, draw you cards, attack multiple monsters with over 7000 attack, or attach opponents monsters to it as material. (These effects mostly come from the quick play spells.)</p><p>They're Cute!</p><p>Cons:</p><p>Purrelys don't give you access to a mass amount of rank 8s, so you lose out on making 38, 90, Felgrand, or Coach King Giantrainer, which draws 3 cards.</p><p>Dangers can give you access to as many discards as you need for your darkworlds, but in purrely, you get a limited amount of summons with your quick plays.</p><p>Dangers provide many of your draws so that you can get your powerful dark worlds like Snoww or Genta.</p><p>You don't have access to Dugares the Timless in this version of the deck. You could make it theoretically by using a genta and a normal summoned level 4, but I've never had a situation where I could do that, or it would be better to do that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the number of cons that the Purrely version of the deck has, I think the Pros outweigh them by a landslide. Of course, feel free to edit the deck to your liking. The side deck is the preference for the upcoming format, though I do recommend Lancea since it can stop some of the Kashtira, floo, and sword soul tenyi cards, as well as shifter and bystials. Unfortunately it doesn't stop shifter on your turn, but it can prevent an otk against some decks.</p>"

Every win you get with this deck is earned, you've outplayed your opponent and should be proud of yourself.</p><p>You have several goals and options for winning, ABC, XYZ, A-to-Z, and the best but worst of all ADCC.</p><p>A quick overview of the deck reveals that 26 of the cards from the main deck are bricks alone. The only one card combos you have are Rescue Cat into Ronin Raccoon/Centurea &amp; Zeus OR Union Hangar into Platinum Gadget &amp; ABC.</p><p>This deck cannot function without spell cards, extra deck access, graveyard access, banish zone access, draw power, and ojamas. If you lack one of these things the deck crumbles to nothing but sad, face-down defense position monsters, and an end phase. The key to overcoming this is to believe you will draw something, anything at all.</p><p>A playable hand is considered as a single Ojama Blue, even better if you go second and only have Ojama Blue.<br />A decent hand is Ojama Blue and Ojama Pajama.<br />A good hand is Ojamagic and Ojamatch.<br />A great hand is Ojamagic, Ojamatch, Ojamassimilation.<br />A perfect hand is Ojamagic, Ojamatch, Ojamassimilation <strong>x2</strong>, and any ojama.</p><p>Now before I get into the combos I would like to generally explain what everything in the deck is used for and why it has its place.</p><p><br /><br /><strong><span>Monsters</span></strong></p><hr /><p><strong>Ojamas: </strong>Firstly, yes I run two sets of the main Ojamas and that's because if you have a single set and draw <strong>1</strong> Ojama, Ojamagic is dead until the Ojama is returned to the deck. Locking off one of your most important cards is not helpful. Blue is at 3 obviously because it's Ojama's best searcher, 2 Red for having two sets of the main Ojamas, Pink at 1 just because you gotta have 'em all. (Also good for digging if you need it. (You do.))<br /><strong>Union:</strong> ABCVWXYZ are quite self explanitory, all but ABC are bricks as they are the only ones with useful effects for summoning and searching.<br /><strong>Armed Dragons:</strong> These are really only fodder for Ojamatch and summoning LV10, 3 out of the 4 cards here are bricks but, with LV3 you're at least able to start the climb however, without 3 other monsters you can't get much.<br /><strong>Rescue Cat:</strong> Rescue Cat doesn't do much other than a surefire way to get Zeus if Ronin Raccoon or Centurea are able to exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Spell/Trap</strong></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Destruction/Backrow: </strong>Raigeki, Harpie, and Delta Hurricane are all amazing boardwipes; Delta Hurricane isn't the best card to activate as you need 3 or 5 cards to make this happen, Ojamagic, Ojamatch, and Delta Hurricane, or Red, the 3 main Ojamas, and Delta Hurricane- However, it <em>IS</em> searchable. <br />Originally the deck had three Twin Twisters but that seemed overkill for discarding and backrow removal, so I cut down to one as I find that to be managable. <br /><strong>Engine:</strong> Ojamagic, Ojamatch, Ojamassimilation, and Ojama Pajama are your bread and butter for the deck. Ojamatch to discard Ojamagic to get Red &amp; LV3 is free Saruya &amp; ABC/XYZ. Ojamassimilation can also be used for partial summons with one your two Ojamas for Utopia &amp; Bujin in the sidedeck or a link 2 for Gadget. Union Hangar is guaranteed ABC if drawn so it's very good for creating A-to-Z if you have the right cards. <br /><strong>Duo:</strong> Ojama Duo is a very versitile card, you can set it in the event of a sky striker player, activate from grave to summon and xyz/link, OR, the most common: save it in grave as a final protection after your board gets broken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Extra</span></strong><span> <strong>Deck<br /></strong></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Fusions: </strong>These cards are your lifeline, without these the deck is OVER. First of all, yes VW is trash, don't summon it alone, there is no reason to do so, just go into Utopia. ABC is your main man, with a Quick, OPT Banish effect it's the main, and usually only, choice for interuption. Along with ABC's tag out for material it's great at dodging targets and blocking lots of monsters. Just watch for Called By. XYZ is an occasional usecase, for when ABC banish isn't enough or when ABC is out of commission, XYZ usually has the job covered as long as you have cards in hand to do so, remember Ojamagic gives 3 so it's essentially 4 pops. VWXYZ shouldn't be summoned alone, it's worse ABC, banish a card on the way to ADCC and that's that. But A-to-Z, oh boy, now that's a good card. INFINITE* quick effect omni-negates (*as long as you have cards in hand) on top of the tag out for both ABC and XYZ, there's nothing else to say about this card, it can single handedly shut down your opponent entirely. Finally the biggest baddest fusion of all: ADCC, if you summon this guy, you win. The only if/and/or/but is if it's turn 1 and your opponent hasn't had the chance to put cards on the field, otherwise you're free to absolutely ruin the opponent's day.<br /><strong>XYZ:</strong> The classic opening is Rescue Cat turn 1 into Ronin Raccoon with token into your opponent wasting a destruction on Ronin Raccoon because they didn't read the damn card. Anyways these cards are to help you to get Zeus, they're usually just a last resort for stalling/bouncing otherwise.<br /><strong>Link:</strong> With two Saryujas you have emmense draw power with your main combo being able to summon BOTH for draw 8 and keep 2, you can basically rotate out your entire hand to get extenders for a possible ADCC. Gadget is only here because of Union Hangar, unfortunately you're out of luck if you want to get XYZ as X isn't a Union monster. Pheonix and Unicorn are the usual toolbox Link monsters for bounce and removal, nothin' special.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Side Deck</span></strong></p><hr /><p>I'm going to clump the entire sidedeck all together as this is a kit for switching to pure ABC. You have exactly enough cards to swap out VWXYZ in both the main and extra deck for an ABC turbo playstyle, you keep the Armed Dragons for Ojamatch though you can replace LV5, 7, &amp; 10 with Droplet if you need to. This kit is for if you're facing a deck with lots of negates and disruptions that stop you from getting A-to-Z or ADCC. Utopia is here for breaking larger monsters that can't be targeted, and xyz &amp; Link Bujins are here to synergize with Ronin Raccoon and Centurea and dump material and dig for Ojama cards. Added back up is Droplet &amp; D Barrier. While D Barrier can shut down decks like Tear and Despia it also shuts you down, make sure to have a plan when you use this as it could easily screw you over as hard as it does your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we're done with the deck overview, let's go over how you play the damn thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Combos/Theory</span></strong></p><hr /><p>There are two main combos in this deck, every other combo spawns from these in some form. <br /><strong>[A]</strong> ends on two Saryuja &amp; ABC/XYZ. <br /><strong>[B]</strong> ends on Saryuja, LV10, &amp; ADCC/A-to-Z.<br /><br /><br /><strong>[A] </strong>Saryuja^2 &amp; ABC/XYZ<br />This requires Ojamatch, Ojamagic, and Ojamassimilation* in hand (*<em>It's possible you can draw Ojamassimilation from Saryuja 1's effect so it's not exactly required to start the combo but you will need it for Saruya 2 and ABC</em>.)<br />Ojamatch discards Ojamagic, search Red &amp; LV3 <br />Ojamagic gives Green, Yellow, &amp; Black<br />Normal Summon LV3 with Ojamatch<br />Normal Summon Red<br />Red Special Summons Green, Yellow, and Black<br />Link Red, Green, Yellow, and Black into Saryuja<br />Saryuja draw 4, shuffle 3<br />Ojamassimilation banishes Green, Yellow, and Black to Special Summon A, B, &amp; C* (*<em>If you choose to summon XYZ, do NOT summon Saryuja 2 as XYZ cannot use materials from the grave to fuse</em>)<br />Activate Ojamasssimilation in grave to return the banished Ojamas and draw one card<br />Link LV3, A, B, &amp; C into Saryuja again<br />Saryuja draw 4, shuffle 3<br />Ignore A's effect*<br />B adds W/Y/Z to hand<br />C doesn't trigger unless you have a union monster in hand (*<em>In the event that this happens you should use A to add B and special summon the Union in hand then B with Saryuja's effect to link into Pheonix and draw another Union from B</em>)<br />Banish A, B, &amp; C from grave to Fusion Summon ABC</p><p><strong>[B]</strong> Saruya, LV10 &amp; ADCC/A-to-Z<br />This requires Ojamatch, Ojamagic, Ojamassimilation <strong>x2</strong>, and any Ojama monster<br />Ojamatch discards Ojamagic, search Red &amp; LV3 <br />Ojamagic gives Green, Yellow, &amp; Black<br />Normal Summon LV3 with Ojamatch<br />Normal Summon Red<br />Red Special Summons Green, Yellow, and Black<br />Link Red, Green, Yellow, and Black into Saryuja<br />Saryuja draw 4, shuffle 3* (*<em>Be absolutely sure to keep TWO Ojamas in your hand and any monster BUT an Armed Dragon for this to work </em>(<em>For A-to-Z you want 3 Ojamas</em>))<em><br /></em>Use the two Ojamas and any monster in hand to Summon LV10 from LV3's effect<br />Ojamassimilation banishes any three Ojamas to Special Summon X, Y, &amp; Z<br />Activate Ojamasssimilation in grave to return the banished Ojamas and draw one card<br />Banish X, Y, &amp; Z from FIELD to Fusion Summon XYZ<br />Ojamassimilation banishes the other two Ojamas to Special Summon V &amp; W* (*<em>Or three for ABC if you're going for A-to-Z)<br /></em>Banish V &amp; W to Fusion Summon VW<br />Banish VW &amp; XYZ to Fusion Summon VWXYZ (<em>Rememeber to banish for free!</em>)<br />Banish VWXYZ from Field and LV7 from GY to Fusion Summon ADCC<br /><br /></p><p>These two combos are your BnBs for the deck, Ojamatch and Ojamagic get you Saryuja for digging and three Ojamas plus Ojamassimilation can get you just about anything from the extra deck. Don't restrict yourself to these two combos, if you need to use Pheonix &amp; Unicorn instead of Saryuja 2, go for it. If you want to Utopia, send it. The deck is flexible to an extent where you can get anything as long as you have the right circumstances but it takes a little work to get there.</p><p>A piece of tech to end this off is the secret third combo: <br /><strong>[C] </strong>Ojama Blue Car Crash <br />If you only have Blue and you can attack do this:<br />Normal Summon Blue<br />Proceed to Attack Phase<br />Crash Blue into an ATTACK position monster* (*<em>This does not work against defense position monsters</em>)<br />Blue activates and you Search Ojamatch &amp; Ojamagic<br />Ojamatch discards Ojamagic to search Blue and an Armed Dragon<br />Ojamatch Normal Summons Blue<br />Crash Blue AGAIN<br />Blue activates and you search Ojamatch &amp; Ojama Duo<br />Ojamatch discards Ojama Duo to search Blue again and another Armed Dragon<br />Crash Blue AGAIN to finally search two Ojamassimilations<br />From here, do what you must.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p><hr /><p>Overall, this deck blows. It's not very consistent, however it is very fun. The most fun I've had since I've started playing was with this deck. And let me tell you, it feels so <em>good </em>to banish a player's entire field and grave with ADCC it's like a drug. Knowing that they probably didn't read your card, knowing that next turn they can't activate their cards or effects and slowly they'll realize and you see the horror crawl upon their face as they read ADCC and then surrender. What a glorious deck. Outplaying your opponent feels like an achievement each time, baiting negates and destructions only to reveal an Ojamatch or Ojamassimilation in the back. If you've come this far, give it a try. A few games won't hurt. Who knows, maybe you'll grow an appreciation for the deck or maybe you'll laugh at me for playing something so garbage in competitive formats. Whatever your choice is I hope you enjoyed your time here. Thank you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

A MTG player returning to Yugioh with the 25th anniversiy, very new to modern Yugioh, I wanted to make my own structure decks to essemble a self contained item for casual board game nights. This is the second deck I've made, and as a fan of little idiots I had to make an Ojama deck. I wanted this deck to not be Ojama Soup deck, with Machines and Armed Dragons, but to focus on Ojama fusions and spells.</p><p>My rules are to make sure to include as many archtype cards as possible. Avoid full playsets so decks are not super consistent. However, I ran closer with this list then my penguin deck due to really need OG Ojamas. Include a few staples (Ash, Maxx, etc) for interaction. Possibly include another archtype (or their staples) if they have synergy. &nbsp;</p><p>Any suggestions to make this deck more fun and at a similar power level with modern structures decks would be appreciated.</p>"

(Updated),"<p>After some play testing and research I ended on this list. Unfortunately for the all spell build it's really east for Kashtira to lock you down if you don't have monsters. Having Raye and Roze in the deck not only allows you to play through Kashtira locks but allows you to not only by deck out but also by battle depending on how you use your Runick Spells. Imperm is vital against Branded and Kashtira. Finally, the Side Deck is all things to break boards and ensure you're not losing to the best decks in the format. I took out Messenger of Peace and the Triple tactics cards to fit in Raye, Roze, and Imperm which end up doing a lot more for the deck.&nbsp;</p>"

Evil eye has always been a tower/control deck, and these 2 new cards don't change up that playstyle while also making the deck more consistent.</p><p>A typical endboard usually contains a monster equiped with the Evil Eye of Selene(either Serziel or Gorgon), some backrow/hand traps, and the new spell and monster in the GY. What do they do you ask?</p><p>Well Unleashed is a double foolish FOR COST that searches an Evil Eye equip. The usual sent cards are Gorgoneio and Basiltrice. Gorgoneio can banish itself and pitch an evil eye to search any spell/trap, and Basiltrice can special itself as a quick effect and during the opponents turn link summon an Evil Eye monster. And when you link summon an evil eye, you banish Unleashed to re-equip the equip in the gy to the new monster who now gains their eff.&nbsp;</p><p>While this strategy has a low ceiling, the monster can be very stickey and it is very consistent. You have Serziel who searches anything, the field spell which searches any monster, Gorgoneio which searches any spell/trap, and both Pots that round out that consistency.&nbsp;</p><p>While it might not look that cheap, most of the budget is going into the powerful staples. Seriously in this build, the 3 Pot of Prosperities cost more than the rest of the deck combined. And the deck has no real weaknesses to the common boardbreakers or hand traps running around right now. Lava golem is usually dead here, d-shifter is annoying but isnt necessarily a turn ender, and evenly actually can be played around by using Basiltrice on field summon effect in response to evenly to only have to banish the backrow, then in a new chain you re-equip the Eye.&nbsp;</p><p>All in All, I see this deck being rouge competitive at best, and definitly the option for the budget minded(Again, if you take out the Pot of Prosperities, the price drops by almost $200)</p>"

Easiest way usually is to summon Purrely, then go for Plump, attatch 2 cards from the GY, and activate another quick play for 5 material on Plump. Ideally, the Noir should have at least 2 Delicious Memory as material to be difficult to attack over for most decks. Since the Expurrelys cannot equip quick plays like the Epurrelys can, the field spell can provide a few extra material to make the Noir as big as possible.</p><p>Expurrely Happiness does not have as much of an impact in most games, but is good for summoning off Yeap in the Battle Phase to push for damage and make a Zeus. The DRNM effect is cool but rarely comes up, as you'd probably make a Noir in most situations.</p><p>The Purrely cards in the main take up about half the deck, so the other half has a lot of room to work with for options. I've been using a small Rescue-ACE package as a draw engine. Fire Attacker is great if your opponent summons a monster that searches and can activate every turn if it survives. Delicious and Happy Memories both need a card on the field to resolve (Delicious needs a monster) so having one on your side to choose for the effects can be good to get combos going too.</p><p>I played a lot of monster stealing stuff partly because it paired well with the effect of Pretty Memory's material effect. They are good tools for pressuing an opponent's board and if you can steal a monster you can attatch a different card they control by using the monster you stole.</p><p>The Extra is primarily focused on Purrely. 2 of each name is good in case you can't turbo into Noir and need to rebuild. The only HOPT effects in Purrely are the continuous spell and the trap so it's not impossible to recover from losing your Purrely. Downerd + Zeus make big Zeus. Assembled Nightingale and Linkuriboh are nice if your Purrely effect gets negated on summon and you don't have any quick plays in hand already.</p><p>The Side has mostly anti-Kash cards. Spooky Dogwood is for playing into time and Evenly is just good. I had Lighting Storm in previously and may return it for more backrow hate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is probably not a meta contender yet but has had good performances in the OCG with the new support. For now though, it still has good tools for controling the board and staying alive to build up your Purrely if you can't make Noir in 1 turn. This also deck has a distinct lack of HOPT effects. The biggest problem I think is it's difficult to maintain card advantage as you can discard a lot to use the quick plays. Also, this deck struggles if too many Purrelys get banished, such as from Bystials or Desires.</p>"

It's a pendulum deck folks, it's not gonna come easy.</p><p>You'll usually open with an even split of dinos and dracos. if you have ignis and either luster or pegasus, use either of their effects to pop ignis and summon whichever draconame(s) you didn't open with from deck. either normal a guy or scale powerload and summon the other scale. Using those two, make cross sheep. You want to make cross sheep before pend-ing. Always. always make sure you pend a copy of luster; prominance is probably the best archytypal ExD monster in the deck and luster is the only tuner except for niche ignis shenanigans. With Prominances effect you'll want to get a powerload as you'll be making Dinoster in the cross-sheep zone. When you make Dinoster using powerload, make sure you have pegasus in extra; Use her as the other fusion mat if you must. This is where you'll use the effect of powerload getting back pegasus to hand. Use the hand effect of pegasus to discard and protect dracos for the turn. The protection is nice, but you mainly want it to special it from grave with dinoster's effect. mediocre hands might end there, but if you have another extender you can make paladin. special ignis with paladin's effect to the unused cross-sheep zone in case you have to float on your opponents turn. During the end phase you can take pegasus with paladins effect so you can use the hand effect of pegasus on your opponents turn and protect your big guys.</p><p>Techs</p><p>ONE field spell.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my personal deck I play a copy of the field spell. Cross sheep can help recover the discard so its basically a free card if you play right. We love free cards. The field spell isn't great, but pegasus searches any field spell. If you're a floodgate enjoyer, play zombie world or necrovally, but I like the thematic FS.</p><p>Dinomist Howling.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know it's a gas build, but it is super satisfing to tribute powerload for howling with charge on the field.

You can setup through veiler usually, but ash? No.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway. You won't be winning any events, you probably mightn't even make day 2, Hell, you'll probably get your sh*t mixed by a 4 year old playing a floo deck they traded their happy meal for at your locals, but if you just play with friends and locals you'll have a blast losing to getting evenly matched for your whole board + your life savings + your house + your wife + your kids + and your job, which is what I plan to do once I find other girls who play yu-gi-oh. But man, this deck is fun, complex, cheap(most importantly. The whole deck is like 30 dollars including extra. And 15 of that is exclusivly Cy-Dra Infin and x3 ignis alone) the monsters and lore are pretty cool, and I want to be luster pendulum's and ignis pheonix's wife. Luster, baby, please text me back.

The deck is based on the fact that you <strong>can access Mathmech Circular</strong> through <strong>Primathmech Alembertian</strong> and in <strong>synergy with cyberse monsters</strong> that the deck already accesses in the combo like Linkuriboh <strong>you do the same combo from Linkross' time in the game on Mathmech</strong>.</p><p>That way you <strong>can play normally from Scrap Dino and shape your final field to access the 3 Mathmech monsters in the GY with Superfactorial</strong> to get an excellent end board that <strong>plays around all the blind second cards</strong> at the same time that you <strong>always end up with Omega which means returning Miscellaneosaurus to the GY</strong>. In this version of the deck you <strong>bring Pankratops with Double Evolution Pill</strong> because you can activate Superfactorial even after <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> by tributing Pankratops just to have 3 spaces available on the field and do Laplacian.</p><p>It is because of this detail that I <strong>use only 1 Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</strong> since he is a follow up card in turn 3 of the game. Among the deckbuild details, the main changes I made were <strong>using the G Golem engine, which in this deck makes a lot of sense</strong> because your extra deck is already made up of <strong>Cyberse monsters and they improve and make possible several combos in the deck</strong>. I think this engine manages to be better than the version of this deck with Spright Elf that I had made when the card was not banned. The second major change is adding Ash Blossom by lowering Lost World and Prosperity that synergizes with Small World, so <strong>Small World has multiple ways to add Miscellaneousaurus to the hand</strong>.</p><p>In the <strong>extra deck I consider almost all the necessary cards</strong>, the only flex spot I consider would be <strong>Lambda and Apollousa</strong> that you can use instead of <strong>I:P Masquerena or Splash Mage</strong>. In general, I use almost all the extra deck cards on the first turn, <strong>usually leaving 3 to 5 cards</strong>. That's why <strong>Prosperity can only be used for 3 cards</strong> in the deck.</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////// ///////<strong>GAMEPLAY TEST HAND</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I consider the plays involving this <strong>engine in a lot of detail for each combo you should pay attention to</strong>. Depending on <strong>each combination of cards, you'll make combos using cards and card activation sequences that completely change the end board</strong> or that, if done in the wrong order, don't allow you to build anything.</p><p>This deck has a <strong>very cool concept</strong> and unlike any other approach to the Dinosaur engine, it has consistency and you will definitely be able to have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main points to pay attention to:</strong></p><p>1 - Use the following website to find out the possible <strong>combinations with Small World</strong> in the deck: https://small-world.yugioh-api.com/resolve</p><p>2 - <strong>Restrictions on Mathmech monsters</strong>: you get lock on Extra Deck Cyberse if you use Mathmech Sigma eff.

The bystials are 6s that can go into Beatrice and Lady Lab can search any trap including The Revived Sky God. Lovely Lab will be able to reset it every turn so you can have Slifer every turn. This combo is very unlikely to pull off but that is where the inspiration came from.

This deck also utilises select Springans and Therion engines. The main line in combos is to link summon into Aromaseraphy Jasmin using a monster and Traptrix Sera (which may sound strange but you can special summon Traptrix Sera from the graveyard using Traptrix Holeutea's effect). You can then use Aromaseraphy Jasmine's effect to destroy a Rikka Queen Strenna to special summon Therion Lily Borea from the deck. Rikka Queen Strenna's effect will chain to special summon Sacred Tree Beast, Hypertron. Then you Activate Therion Lily Borea's effect to tribute itself to add Therion Discollesium, which searches Therion King Regulus. This gives you two negates and likely two set trap hole traps.&nbsp;</p><p>If Pot Of Prosperity is too expensive, you can replace it with a Traptrix Pudica and two Hole normal traps.An extra Gravedigger's Trap Hole and Floodgate Trap Hole are probabely the most optimal to add to the deck.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you enjoy this deck</p>"

For that reason, there's a lot of room for customizing this deck, including Raigeki Break. And of course we can't forget the shining star of this deck and the reason we play so many lights: Thunder Nyan Nyan.</p>"

(Looking at you Dragonmaids), well, join the maidenless combatants in this list.","<p>They're back from their 2010s glory with a fresh coat of ""wait, Andal's actually bad"" paint and a theme park sheen that'll probably convince opponents that this thing's actually pretty competitive. The spell and trap line-up should definitely change with each iteration of the format and any future releases; however, the core that's presented here is probably long-standing enough to supplement future variants. Let's get into the list.<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Safety Nets</strong>: The sheer amount of disruption and answer cards we're running in this list make it so that our plays are usually insulated in some way. We should never, ever really be in any remote danger during a game as long as we have a Gladiator Beast and a backline to back them up. Looping Gladiator Beast Charge can also be almost as devastating as looping War Chariot in a lot of cases as well.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Noteworthy Protection</strong>: Barring generics and our focus on clearing as many pesky pieces of backrow as possible with this build, thanks to Rejection, our Gladiator Beasts are protected from most things until it's time to commit to the Battle Phase. It also doubles their usual output from a battle and quickly turns 1 into 2 which is usually fusion play. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>No Andal!</strong>: Rescue Rabbit openers and lines are great for getting into Panther or Dragases or setting up a three material fusion but boy did it suck drawing into that card and not having it be able to tag out like the others. Well, there's none of that anymore. We've compromised the Andal combos and random chance of drawing into Rescue Rabbit before it in the interest of having more playable hands overall. Just protect your guy(s) and run over the opponents. There's no need for any fancy business.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Potent Wincons</strong>: Thanks to Tamer Editor and Secutor, accessing Domitianus and Heraklinos is pretty straightforward, even in Trinity. You just won't be doing it turn 1 like you would in the TCG.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>They're all Garnets; All of them. Opening a Gladiator Beast will probably have you saying ""man, I wish this one stayed in the deck or was another Gladiator Beast."" That's basically this deck's entire experience and why we're only playing the ones that matter. Sadly, that little dilemma will always remain in this deck and there isn't much to be done about it outside of Contact Fusing or bringing out Augustus. It feels even worse that a Trinity is being spent on Proving Ground just to increase the odds of finding a Glad, especially in a pinch. Pick a Glad and pray.<br /><br /></li><li>Extra Deck: The Extra Deck will usually be useless sometimes if you find yourself in a situation where you need to break down a board before you start committing to anything flashy. It's for this reason that we're not on any Extra Deck Trinities here and I'd personally advise against it. Fortunately, this does also mean that we're pretty insulated against cards like Titanocider which is pretty popular this format.<br /><br /></li><li>Forehead Girl is an FTK: Ash solos. Godspeed.</li></ul><p><br />Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />This list isn't about finding gas, it's about opening defenses and protecting your Gladiator. You'll ideally be wanting to always go first. If you're going with no backup, I'd strongly encourage just combat tricking out the opponent. There isn't any specific opener you'll want to look for since Gladiator Beasts take on a midrange playstyle here (without Andal anyway), so your opening hands determine your line of play. Here's a few pointers though if you're inexperienced with them:</p><ul><li><strong>Phalanx: </strong>Control a Gladiator Beast and protect them with backrow. If there's something you can use to either change a monster's battle position to make them vulnerable on your turn or modify combat stats so your monster will survive the attack, that's ideal.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Ob-Noxious:</strong> If you've opened Noxious and backrow, feel free to set those cards and outright pass. Usually people will just attack you outright, so you punish with Noxious. Bin either something you want to bring back with Darius (who Noxious will tag out into after) or bin something you don't want to draw, like Augustus. Tag as appropriate.</li></ul><p><br />The openers aren't always ideal and will vary from game-to-game, especially post-siding. The main thing to do is plan ahead. Measure your options and weigh your forms of interaction well. Everything in your deck is an extremely limited resource and this deck lacks card draw.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where Gladiator Beasts shine really. The main thing to note is that the monsters summoned via Gladiator Rejection aren't treated as being summoned by a Gladiator Beast Monster, so all of the GB effects shouldn't be active. You'll be doing your best Unchained-meets-Dragonmaid impression here... despite preceding both of those archetypes. Hmm.</p><ul><li><strong>Bestiari: </strong>Your Spell/Trap removal. This card's also really important for making Gyzarus who is your Icarus Attack on-summon. S/T hate's pretty restricted across the board in Trinity format and most decks only rely on generics to get it done. Since Glad Beasts tag out often, you have this form of removal going for you on top of the generic removal you're already running here. It's worth noting that this card's effect to destroy is mandatory, so don't summon it willy-nilly otherwise you might end up having to pop your own backline.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Murmillo: </strong>Your Monster removal. This card's your go-to for checking the board and clearing potential threats. Its combat stats leave much to be desired, but it doesn't have to partake in combat if it's already won now has it? Use it for fusion material when you can, or take an open attack. Don't get greedy with the fish.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>The Tag Team:&nbsp;</strong>Gladiator Beast War Chariot's an amazing Counter Trap and since most win conditions in Trinity format revolve around Monster effects, having access to this is nothing to scoff at. Samnite grabs this for you and Equeste loops this for you. Loop these two as necessary to keep up the War Chariot pressure and you'll have your opponent on the ropes.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Sagittari Cycling</strong>: Thanks to all of them being functional Garnets in the hand outside of for Augustus and Vespasius, it means that you can pitch them without second thought to Sagittari and dig for much better and reliable cards in the form of your Spells and Traps. Combined with Besitari, Gyzarus, and Equeste, Sagitarri also helps for being another Icarus target to blow away the opponent.</li></ul><p>Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame due to all of the removal, but Gladiator Beasts can definitely go into a late or grind game.<br /><br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS<br /></strong><br />The killing blow. Leave absolutely no room for a comeback. This is the Gladiator's Proving Ground.</p><ul><li><strong>Secutor: </strong>Resolving Secutor once basically wins the game on the spot. Resolving it during the opponent's turn? Well, that's probably traumatizing to say the least. Ideally you'll be wanting to bring out those that are all-stars in the midgame (as listed above); however, if you're ready to go in for the kill, summon out Laquari or Vespasius instead for fusion setups we'll cover just below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Tamer Editor</strong>: This thing just cheats. Summon it with Rejection lines or by using Attorix on your own turn.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Domitianus: </strong>Monster effect activation negation with no cost whatsoever and dictates who attacks who during your opponent's turn? Make this when you know it's a valid win condition. Just keep in mind that it only tags out into only 1 other Gladiator Beast. This card is really bad to use mid game as a result since, if it would fall, you would be put severely behind for the contact fusion play. Don't be greedy with Domitianus.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Heraklinos: </strong>Your Spell/Trap activation negation station. This card ain't even once per turn. As long as you have cards to discard, you can keep up the suffocation against your opponent. Unfortunately, this card doesn't have a tag out nor a float, so it should be used exclusively as a finisher where you're confident it will win. If it happens to get removed, you'll be set back pretty far.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />The most important thing to note about this list is that any and all Spell/Traps selected here can and should be experimented with and swapped out to fit your playstyle with the deck in a given format. This is not a one size fits all situation and due to the variance concerning the hands, the learning curve with deciphering the best way to spend one's opening turns is definitely pretty steep. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>Melffy engine with Andal, Traptrix/Gokipole engine, Amazement Engine, SPYRAL Engine, Rescue-ACE, Trinities on Gladiator Beast Noxious &amp; Bestiari, Geartown engine, Loop of Destruction, Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Amazement Ambassador Bufo, Archfiend's Staff of Despair, Gladiator Beast's Battle Manica, Burden of the Mighty<br /></em><br />Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! This deck's a classic in Yu-Gi-Oh! history and it's honestly incredible to see it in a playable state in modern Trinity's climate. But don't just take my word for it- step on up into the Colosseum to Disarm, Parry, and Lash out against any and all who oppose your bestial fury!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

With more handtraps, I removed a Double Iris and Harmonizing magician to thin the deck and make it so you're less likely to draw only 8s. Both double iris and Harmonizing can be searched so it's not as big of a hit. If you can get Harmonizing on, you can get Celestial on which makes Timestar, you can start dumping key cards like Performal Pendulum Sorcerer in GY with effects like butler or wisdom eye, and special summon it with cross-sheep/selene and search Dissolver/OddeyesSyncron/Butler, which then can be used to fuse Vortex Dragon, then Odd-eyes Syncron can be summoned with Blackfang/Selene/Crosssheep/Spright Elf and Sychro with Dissolver in backrow into Baronne. If you start with Performal Pendulum Sorcerer, it is possible to fusion summon Vortex Dragon on the 5th summon for Niburu protection. Do this while using Electrumite to break Double Iris and/or Black Fang Magician to get enough monsters on board to Syncro/Link, and you should end up with two Pendulumgraphs and Purple Poison on backrow, Appolousa on front row, along with Vortex/Baronne/Borreload.</p>"
