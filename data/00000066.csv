Dustons are on the loose! GET THE VACUUM.","<p>Now that the genesys format is here, a lot of old archetypes that haven't gotten to see the light may get to rear their dusty heads. Dustons has never really gotten a chance to shine, especially since the release of Link monsters. Why give the opponent 5+ free materials that they can easily get rid of?</p><p>Well, without Link monsters and a general lowering power levels through Genesys Points, Dustons may just be able to snatch a win or two. Not tournament wins, like... single duel wins. Will this deck be able to compete against the top meta? Probably not, 1 or 2 disruptions would probably be enough to bury this troll deck. And it has no disruption, unless you side in Hand Traps. So what are the upsides of Dustons?</p><ol><li>Locks down the enemy's monster zones with worthless Duston monsters (and Ojama Trio in this version). Dustons can't be tributed or used as Fusion, Synchro or XYZ materials.</li><li>Starduston is an INCREDIBLE floodgate. The opponent can't Special Summon monsters or activate Set Spells or Traps.</li><li>OTK potential with both Starduston, Goblin King &amp; Slacker Magician. Battle Mania is needed, sometimes Ojama Trio/Duo.</li><li>Level 1 monsters have a lot of support with consistent searching, allowing you to set up your combo.</li><li>Pot of Extravagance provides some draw power with basically 0 downside, you barely use the Extra Deck.</li><li>Great Kaiju synergy going 2nd. You need to crash your monsters to do any combos. Stygian Security also helps with getting House Duston out there.</li><li>Simple Combo: crash/set House Duston &gt; flood the field &gt; summon Starduston (4000 ATK) / Goblin King / Slacker Magician</li><li>Multiple OTK angles, Starduston is the most common but you can use Goblin King &amp; Slacker Magician as well. Slacker Magician is one of the most interesting OTK angles this deck has going for it, since she can OTK if the opponent's field is flooded with Dustons / Ojamas and you have Battle Mania. She also has a lot of built-in protection. Problem with this angle is that the opponent's field will most likely be too flooded to even use Ojama Trio. Ojama Duo COULD work instead. The combo would go like this: Normal summon &amp; crash House Duston / Stygian Sentry &gt; Summon 2 Dustons to both sides of the field &gt; Summon Slacker Magician using 2 White Dustons &gt; Set Ojama Duo &amp; Battle Mania (Trap Trick replaces either of these) &gt; End Turn &gt; Standby Phase: activate Battle Mania.</li><li>Pot of Extravagance + Trap Trick gives higher odds of nailing the opponent with Battle Mania.</li><li>Deck has GREAT synergy with Ojama Trio/Duo, only problem is that they can be used for Synchros. The idea is that they can disrupt the enemy through filling their monster zones, as well as give you more bodies to force your opponent to crash with Battle Mania. It can also be searched with Trap Trick. If you don't wanna play Ojama Trio/Duo, you could try Unexpected Dai, Final Attack Orders or Kinka-Byo. There is definitely a Rank 1 XYZ angle with Kinka-Byo &amp; Unexpected Dai.</li><li>Rank 13 + 31 XYZ angle. Baby Tiragon + Goblin King is also interesting, but will only hit for 6000-7000 damage at most.</li><li>The deck is cheap!</li></ol><p>Sadly this deck has basically 0 proactive plays on Turn 1 except for setting a House Duston / Stygian Sentry / Ojama Trio &amp; passing. Thankfully House Duston triggers from card destruction effects as well, so that's nice.</p><p>The deck is also untested so take everything in here with a pinch of salt LMAO THANKS FOR READING SUCKER. Jokes aside, I'm most unsure about the Ojama Trio/Duo synergy. Might just be better to go more into the XYZ angle and dish out Number 13 + 31.</p><p>Ignore the Side Deck.</p>"

Or dependant on hands 3 Powerload. With 3 Powerload you have 3x 4400 ATK Towers monsters. While it doesn't throw up many interactions in the way of negates, 3 towers monsters with 4K+ atk is often hard to overcome. Turn 3 you can use Powerload to pop the field and if you have more Gouki's in hand can go for a Master Ogre with finishing move for the spice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Need for Almiraj</strong></p><p>This deck lacks a true 1 card combo unfortunately (Good Link 1 Gouki anytime Konami...) and so must rely on opening 2 Gouki in hand. While you typically want to have one of the Suprex's in hand, sometimes luck isn't on your side, so we turn to the next best thing...Almiraj. This is why the deck runs a large quantity of Gouki's with 1000 or less attack, opening any 2 Gouki names including an under 1000 ATK Gouki is full combo linking into Almiraj and searching Machine Suprex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main Weaknesses (droll...)</strong></p><p>This deck's weakness to handtraps is still very much true, especially at the hands of Droll. If you opened one of the two Suprex combos you can end on at the absolute worst just Powerload, but in the past I have managed to end on Powerload + S:P/Bagooska but only courtesy of really lucky hands.</p>"

Zep + Snopios + any other fish gets you to White Aura Whale or Askaan, and those same hands + Hop Ear enable a turn 0 Deep Beyond!</p><p>Worried your opponent will make you go first in game 2? No problem! Just side into the White Aura package and put up 3-5 interruptions. Ideal endboard looks something like: random 6* body for synchro plays + Dragite/Aegirine + Kragen/Archethys + a banished tuner + Keaf(either banished or on board). But sometimes all you have is a Deep Beyond and a dream.</p>"

Consistency wise this deck is very high rolly, so many cards are dedicated to banishing and drawing as much as possible to get Ghoti banished while getting bodies on board. This deck is very low pointed for obvious reasons and struggles to pay off other than a ton of sticky bodies, so a slower much more board presence focused play style seems to be the speed of the deck. - I have no idea what to put in the side so it's mostly filled with more synergy ideas than tech cards, same with the extra.</p>"

You can definitely cut the Mourners and the Emeral and play a third copy of either Ponix or Kirin, I simply wanted to experiment with a higher handtrap count. Another option is to trade the Rescue-Ace package for two Nibiru or two Droll and then play a second Arvata. Finally, due to the lack of Extravagance the extra deck is now extremely flexible, I'm just still running the 3-of's for now because I'm just trying to get a list put together quickly lol, but tbf I don't think it's all that bad to have the repeatable board wipes since the deck doesn't really use its extra deck much anyways.</p>"

Even though it's of my opinion that the version I posted wasn't the most optimal, even for the time, I still wanted to post an updated list using the new tools Infinitrack Trains have gotten over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, I want to state that<strong> the goal of the deck is still the same as it always has been</strong> with EARTH Machine: to attempt to survive until their Battle Phase, where they'll hit the opponent HARD in the jaw as much as possible. This version of the deck has been streamlined to this function, and yet should still have the ability to go first. This is with a card I previously didn't utilize, due to its lacking potential: ""Urgent Schedule"".&nbsp;</p><p>""<strong>Urgent Schedule</strong>"" allows you to summon 2 EARTH Machine monsters, one Level 4 or lower and one Level 5 or higher, from your deck, with their effects negated while on the field. This card was previously only good in my eyes when you needed bodies on the field going second, but due to it negating their effects, it could never be considered a true starter for the deck. That was, until the wonderful card called ""Clockwork Knight"" came out. Using the low-level monster as material, and tributing the other monster summoned by ""Urgent Schedule"", you can now go full combo going second using only 1 card! And if you already have a way to combo, you can use the extra bodies as material to either extend your combo or further insulate the endboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Another card that might look slightly out of place in this list for anyone outside of the EARTH Machine sphere is ""<strong>On Your Mark, Get Set, Duel!</strong>"" and ""<strong>Jet Synchron</strong>"". Using ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Duel!"" as a starter, then Normal Summoning ""Jet Synchron"" and using that as material for ""Clockwork Knight"", you can search ""<strong>Clockwork <em>Night</em></strong>"" from your deck. ""Clockwork Night"" has a GY effect to search a EARTH Machine by sending a card from your hand, so 1 ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Duel!"" and 1 discard represents full combo, just as much as any other starter in the deck. This combo replaced the older card ""Machina Metalcruncher"", which whilst having by itself both pros and cons, felt a tad bit too clunky to synergize really well with the deck, which ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Duel!"" and ""Jet Synchron"" somewhat fixes.&nbsp;</p><p>Another fantastic card for the stratergy is ""<strong>Double Wild</strong>"", which allows you to theoretically summon out any Level 10 from the deck, or any Machine stuck in your hand. Since it's only included in the Side Deck here, I won't go into detail about it, and instead point you to a great video by PeepsYGO detailing the power of many oh these new cards, namely ""Clockwork Knight"", ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Duel!"" and ""Double Wild"". The video will be linked below. (do note how the deck showed off in the video <strong>is a different variant/take on the EARTH Machine stratergy</strong>, and is only somewhat similar to this version of the stratergy. The video shows a more combo-oriented version of EARTH Machine based on a resource-heavy control style, whilst this version is a more streamlined OTK variant.)</p><p><strong>Additional Note:</strong> When Arise-Heart finally gets banned in Master Duel, replace him in this list with the new Rank 7 'Constellar' XYZ (currently named ""Exstellarknight Constellar Ptolemy&nbsp;&Omega;7""). It functionally fills the same roles as Arise-Heart, as a good Rank 7 Machine to end on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, I hope this new variant of Infinitrack Trains I've cooked up is worth your time, as it has a quite straightforward playstyle yet is satisfying and fun to play. I'd greatly appreciate feedback if you have with this deck, so please don't hesitate to post a comment if you have any questions!</p>"

Use those Chronicles Structure decks and win with Albaz!,"<p>Post 10.27.2025 point list, many Branded duelists despaired seeing how ridiculously expensive some of the Branded cards have become! Branded Fusion's points went from 33 to 40, while most of the Albaz fusions have been slapped with a 10+ point penalty! This makes Branded much weaker, since many sacrifices have to be made just so most of the strategy's engine remains intact since the Branded cards are very point heavy. The decklist very ""barebones"" lacking key cards such as Titaniklad &amp; Guardian Chimera in the Extra Deck and additional copies of Branded Fusion &amp; Quem in the Main Deck. We couldn't even use the new cards from the Chronicles Structure deck since ""The Fallen and Virtuous"" and ""The Dragon That Devours the Dogma"" are all so expensive!<br /><br />This doesn't mean that Branded isn't viable! In fact, the strategy is still extremely strong in a simplified, lower power level format! Not only is it powerful, the deck is very consistent, hardly bricking with multiple ways to Branded Fusion and several extenders to keep plays going. This deck features an additional Dracotail engine with triple Rahu which is surprisingly free given how incredible that card is! <br /><br />Otherwise Branded, plays as usual - summoning gigantic fusion boss monsters, immense card advantage, and playing during the infamous ""Main Phase 3"" (End Phase)!&nbsp;<br /><br />After spending about 12 hours deckbuilding, tweaking points and testing in duels, I think I've hit the sweet spot for the ratios of Branded cards with supplimentary engines in the Main, Extra and Side Decks. If you need any explanations with the cards chosen or any other questions feel free to ask in the comments below. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the main combo for GENESYS Branded featuring 1 Aluber, 1 monster and 2 discards:&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>1. Normal summon Aluber and activate Aluber's effect to search Branded Fusion.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, using Albaz and Phryxul from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>3. CL1 Albion to fusion summon Lubellion using Albaz + Aluber, CL2 Phryxul to set from deck Rahu Dracotail.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Activate Lubellion discarding 1 card fusion summon Mirrorjade using Lubellion + Albaz.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Activate Rahu Dracotail to fusion summon Gulamel, using any monster in hand and Dracotail Pan from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Activate Pan's effect to set any Dracotail trap from deck (whatever is relevant to the matchup) and to destroy Albion on field.&nbsp;</p><p>7. During the End Phase, Albion adds to hand Branded Opening.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Activate Branded Opening to summon from deck Quem.&nbsp;</p><p>9. Activate Quem to send to GY Cartesia.&nbsp;</p><p>During your opponent's turn, Quem can summon Cartesia for further fusion plays, Mirrorjade can banish a monster and Dracotail trap with Gulamel's targeted destruction! This is the simplest combo, but stronger endboards can be made if you have the correct hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You start by summoning low-level Maliss monsters (like March Hare, White Rabbit, Dormouse, Chessy Cat) to set or banish cards, then leverage the @Ignister cards (such as Backup @Ignister, Wizard @Ignister) to fetch monsters and trigger Link Summons. Once you&rsquo;ve established one of your Maliss Link monsters (like Hearts Crypter, White Binder, Red Ransom) alongside generic Link bosses (like Accesscode Talker or Firewall Dragon), you control the field by both disruption (through trap/banish effects) and board presence. The &ldquo;Maliss in Underground&rdquo; field spell helps by making your Maliss Link monsters extremely strong when you&rsquo;ve banished several Maliss traps, while also forcing your opponent&rsquo;s monsters to target your Maliss Links letting you funnel attacks and protect your other cards. In short: banish Maliss cards summon Maliss links overlay with @Ignister support lock the opponent out of plays with disruption and banish-effects.</p>"

Other tech pieces in this list include a small Shaddoll package to enhance our boardbreaking and consistency with High Spirits (we can also run a fun card in side deck), a proper Dogmatika package is here to really make use of Fallen&amp;Virtuous multiple times in a grind game. A card normally not that good in branded is also making a name for itself as an alternate to non-fuisonable bosses on our opponent's field: The Bystial Aluber becomes really powerful if your opponent only has dragons due to buster dragon's effect as he's just a ""quick-play""change of heart we can access through engine. IDP with our end board is criminal btw, may consider a 3rd copy.</p><p>For the side deck I'm currently testing some options to see what I like most. Extra copies of Thunderbolt make it more likley to interrupt combos when going 2nd with our busted Fallen&amp;Virtuous. I've also added Shaddoll Fusion for when we're forced to go 2nd as Construct is uniquley powerful into extra deck end boards and forces the fusion to be negated or we shatter their board with a free +1.</p>"

You WILL summon Psy-Reflector!,"<p>A fairly straight foward Assault Mode deck without all the new OCG only cards for obvious reasons. I chose the Psychic cards to pair with the strategy because Psy-Reflector is also a Psychic monster, so you get some needed extra bridges into it, and being able to play P.U.N.K.s is also pretty nice.</p><p>The deck has all sorts of ways to get Teleport, you can use it as a starter, extender or even as an interruption putting it face-down and getting Ghost Ogre at the start of your opponent's turn.</p><p>Beware of some locks, though. Serene Psychic Girl locks you into summoning Psychics from your Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, so you want to summon Stardust before commiting into her.

Deck can, in theory, go first or second successfully. Going first you'll want to get your Silent Zeros out at minimum. Going second should focus on trying to OTK, or at least severely cripple, your opponent with Gandora. We run two Dark Magicians to help guarantee an OTK by using Gandora to wipe the field with at least three cards being destroyed/banished. Gandora gets us a 2500+ Silent Magician Zero, the Dark Magician comes back and gets us Secrets of Dark Magic, then we attack for 2500+2500, use Secrets to fuse Gandora and DM into Dark Magician the Dragon Knight, and hit for the last 3000.</p>"

Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</strong></span><br /><br />Post 10.27.2025 point list, many Branded duelists despaired seeing how ridiculously expensive some of the Branded cards have become! Branded Fusion's points went from 33 to 40, while most of the Albaz fusions have been slapped with a 10+ point penalty! This makes Branded much weaker, since many sacrifices have to be made just so most of the strategy's engine remains intact since the Branded cards are very point heavy. The decklist very ""barebones"" lacking key cards such as Titaniklad &amp; Guardian Chimera in the Extra Deck and additional copies of Branded Fusion &amp; Quem in the Main Deck. We couldn't even use the new cards from the Chronicles Structure deck since ""The Fallen and Virtuous"" and ""The Dragon That Devours the Dogma"" are all so expensive!<br /><br />This doesn't mean that Branded isn't viable! In fact, the strategy is still extremely strong in a simplified, lower power level format! Not only is it powerful, the deck is very consistent, hardly bricking with multiple ways to Branded Fusion and several extenders to keep plays going. This deck features an additional Dracotail engine with triple Rahu which is surprisingly free given how incredible that card is! <br /><br />Otherwise Branded, plays as usual - summoning gigantic fusion boss monsters, immense card advantage, and playing during the infamous ""Main Phase 3"" (End Phase)!&nbsp;<br /><br />After spending about 12 hours deckbuilding, tweaking points and testing in duels, I think I've hit the sweet spot for the ratios of Branded cards with supplimentary engines in the Main, Extra and Side Decks. If you need any explanations with the cards chosen or any other questions feel free to ask in the comments below. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is the main combo for GENESYS Branded featuring 1 Aluber, 1 monster and 2 discards:&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>1. Normal summon Aluber and activate Aluber's effect to search Branded Fusion.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, using Albaz and Phryxul from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>3. CL1 Albion to fusion summon Lubellion using Albaz + Aluber, CL2 Phryxul to set from deck Rahu Dracotail.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Activate Lubellion discarding 1 card fusion summon Mirrorjade using Lubellion + Albaz.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Activate Rahu Dracotail to fusion summon Gulamel, using any monster in hand and Dracotail Pan from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Activate Pan's effect to set any Dracotail trap from deck (whatever is relevant to the matchup) and to destroy Albion on field.&nbsp;</p><p>7. During the End Phase, Albion adds to hand Branded Opening.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Activate Branded Opening to summon from deck Quem.&nbsp;</p><p>9. Activate Quem to send to GY Cartesia.&nbsp;</p><p>During your opponent's turn, Quem can summon Cartesia for further fusion plays, Mirrorjade can banish a monster and Dracotail trap with Gulamel's targeted destruction! This is the simplest combo, but stronger endboards can be made if you have the correct hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

I'm also using hand traps that can be Normal Summoned to make ASHLAN U1000, which considerably increases the play options after interruptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my Extra Deck, I'm using cards useful for all scenarios; there aren't any other Link Monsters that I consider useful, and the XYZ toolbox is very versatile for playing first or second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've left cards in the Side Deck to improve my going-first strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>---------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I'll show you in 3 similar combos how you can easily access all 3 Ritual engines in the deck (Megalith, Light Fairy, and Impcantation) with the Megalith engine plus any normal summon:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COMBO 1</strong>: Unformed + Ophiel + any normal summon</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Place the continuation of the link on the website duelingbook.com /</p><p>replay?id=813757-76414993</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>End Board: ASHLAN U1000 + Drill Driver Vespenato + Anastasis + Portal + Emergence</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Hand: Aratron + Phul + Benten + Herald (2 draw, discard 1) In GY: Phuloch and Bethor</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cool thing about this combo is that you can do it even if you normal summoned Manju and your opponent negated it with Ash Blossom or Infinite Impermanence, for example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This combo is excellent because you separate the interactions in different places:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* You have ASHLAN U1000 on the table to bounce a card, and in the spell/trap zone you have Anastasis to tribute an opponent's monster without targeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* You have triggers for their effects at different times, one with Phuloch and the other with Aratron, which are ways to Ritual Summon on the opponent's turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* In addition to Aratron to summon Phul from your hand, you also have Orange Light negate along with Benten in your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* There are at least 4 interactions: Bounce ASHLAN U1000, Tribute a monster with Anastasis, Orange Light negate monster, and Benten effect destroy all opponent's cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'll show below that you can achieve this endboard with the other Megalith monsters as well:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMBO 2: Unformed + Phuloch + any normal summon</p><p>replay?id=813757-76415515</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMBO 3: Unformed + Hagith + any normal summon</p><p>replay?id=813757-76415810</p><p>You can do the same combo if, instead of a level 4 Megalith, you have a level 8 Megalith in your hand along with Unformed. In that case, you use the first Unformed to bring out Hagith, and Hagith adds another Unformed to access Phul from deck and perform the combo normally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this, the deck became better for playing the traditional TCG, and that's why I'm updating the decklist on the website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-------------------------<strong>My thoughts on Megalith in the Genesys format after a month of testing</strong>:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was very excited to use Megalith in the Genesys format because the deck doesn't actually need Link monsters to play, and Megalith can be quite competitive in this format, which is a bit more balanced for the deck's power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the updated points list no longer allows for optimal use of the deck:</p><p>They gave Anastasis 33 points and Manju 1 point, and since Gallant Granite already had 33 points plus Benten's 40 points, it's simply not possible to use all 3 cards at the same time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For me, using Megalith with these cards is indispensable, since the deck no longer has a single combo card, and losing one of its best cards made me abandon the Genesys format and focus solely on seeing how the deck works in the TCG.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It has significantly improved with the addition of the new support cards and Ashlan U1000, and I hope you enjoyed what I presented.</p>"

Good lord, the new Masked HEROs can't come soon enough...","<p>DISCLAIMER: I am an extremely casual player. This deck was built to go head-to-head with other petdecks at Genesys locals, not to top in competitive brackets. I welcome any and all feedback on this list.</p><p>Alright, with that out of the way: Here's what I'm cooking.</p><p>HERO gets hit pretty hard in Genesys format due to the loss of <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=58004362"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/58004362.jpg"" data-card=""58004362"" data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</span></a>. The lack of consistency for what was already a pretty inconsistent and/or bricky deck means that we need to take a few steps back and think about what we're trying to do here. So far, many of the lists I've seen for HERO in Genesys are just some flavor of turbo Dark Law and Plasma and pass. That&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>a game plan you can do. However: You use 90 of your allocated points for that (or more realistically 99, if you're playing 3x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=40044918"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/40044918.jpg"" data-card=""40044918"" data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos).</span></a> In addition, that means you can play very few if any pointed hand traps like Snow, Ghost Mourner, Effect Veiler, etc.</p><p>Instead, I've tried to build a list that is 1) fun for the person on the other end of the table, and 2) can play handtraps to prevent them from setting up in the first place. By my count, we're playing 23 starters/ways to get to a starter in this deck, which means you're almost never going to open a completely unplayable hand. The 7 handtraps to interrupt your opponent's combo are... okay, but I'll probably change this in the future. We'll revisit that at the end.</p><p>Now, onto a few deckbuilding decisions that might raise an eye here:</p><p><strong>2x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=22865492"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22865492.jpg"" data-card=""22865492"" data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</span></a>:</strong> Even in a 50 card deck, drawing the single garnet is very possible. The risk of that cutting you off the Faris line entirely is, IMO, not worth it. If you draw both... Well, that blows! Notably, a single Increase in the hand isn't the end of the world&mdash;It can still be Poly'd or Dark Fusion'd away, or even discard fodder for <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=3519195"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/3519195.jpg"" data-card=""3519195"" data-name=""Evil Assault"">Evil Assault</span></a> or <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=18094166"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/18094166.jpg"" data-card=""18094166"" data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</span></a>.... assuming you have another Increase!</p><p><strong><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=32807846"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/32807846.jpg"" data-card=""32807846"" data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</span></a>:</strong> 35 points is a lot to spend on a starter. There is a valid argument for cutting this to play more handtraps. My perspective is that it's not only one of the best starters for HERO in the game, it can also be a force multiplier. You have Stratos or Vyon already in hand, and you ROTA into the one-of Solid Soldier to further extend. Still, you could retool this deck to drop ROTA in favor of <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=52947044"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/52947044.jpg"" data-card=""52947044"" data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</span></a>.

For that reason, there's a world in which you cut the 2x Mali, Denier, and DPE in order to play more hand traps. Those 20 points could go to 2 more Droll and 2 more... something. The more I type this out, the more I like that idea, actually.

The combo gets even easier if you have magigirl already in rotation due to being able to set up displacment into Intervention to go into using their monster to ritual back out the doombroker plus going into another search with which ever one you sent back to your hand with displaced.</p><p>Going 2nd its just dont die to interuption which is semi easy with how easy it is to churn through multiple effects. Being able to go into Fireburster that is basically a towers that can attack twice and deal double damage can easily clear boards without commiting everything.

Depending on what you need.</p><p><strong>1x Bystial Magnumhut&nbsp;</strong>- Recurcses dragon monsters, including ED monsters, or adds bystial/Albaz in hand.</p><p><strong>1x Branded Regained</strong> - Adds extra rescursion when you banish which is with a lot of your boss monster effects, it also hurts Maliss. allows extra draws every turn and puts more board pressence by putting Druiswurm or Mangumhut back on field.</p><p><strong>1x Branded Beast -</strong> Adds an extra pop to your endboard, really good for outing floodgates, helps keep Regained on field.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>Invoked Engine:</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>1x Invocation</strong> - Searchable with Aleister, uses enemies GY as fusion material, can summon any monster using in-hand monsters. Adds itself back to deck by adding Aleister back to hand.</p><p><strong>1-2x Aleister The Invoker</strong> - NS, to add Invocation from deck to hand, can send itself from hand in Battle Phase to increase Fusion monsters ATK by 1000.</p><p><strong>3x Magical Meltdown</strong> - Searches Aleister. Prevents The activation or cards and effects that include an effect that fusion summoners a fusion monster from being negated [The Activation and NOT the effect] So this doesn't negate ash blossom. But the majority of other negates are useless when this card is on the field. Then your opponent also cannot activate cards or effects on fusion summon. Reducing the amount of times your opponent can interact is so powerful, and when it comes with a search for such a powerful card, its just perfect.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>Despia Engine:</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>2-3x Aluber The Jester of Despia</strong> - Main searcher for Branded Fusion, can also search Retribution/Branded in Red/ Regained/Beast. When a fusion leaves the field, you can summon it from GY and negate a monster of the field till the end of the turn, and because it summons itself, you can search again.</p><p><strong>3x Branded Opening</strong> - Great starter to summon Aluber from deck, also can banish itself from GY to protect fusion monsters from destruction effects, this can protect all Fusion monsters at once.</p><p><strong>1x Guiding Quem, The Virtuous</strong> - Quem is probably the weakiest card to start with but the best card turn 2/3, considered as both dogmatika and despia, it can be summoned to field by Branded Opening/Titaniklad/Granguignol/Despian Quaeritis when they are removed from the field. Quem allows you to send any card that mentions fallen of albaz from deck to GY, but even better when a monster leaves the ED, summons back a fallen of albaz or 1 monster that mentions at best mirrorjade or another fusion monster.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>Branded Engine:</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>2x Fallen of Albaz</strong> - Main name for the deck's fusions. Can be used sometimes to breakboards when summoned. Can catch the opponent off-guard if combined with Magical Meltdown, because they can't negate it.</p><p><strong>1x Blazing Cartesia</strong> - The best extender for the deck, helps dodge imperm and makes Granguignol. Adds back to hand each turn a fusion is sent to GY.</p><p><strong>3x Fusion Deployment</strong> - Summons any name to the field, targeting Cartesia/Fallen of Albaz also triggers their effects. However, summoning Aleister, doesn't get the search, but can be good for superpoly, just getting a name and body on field makes for great bait.</p><p><strong>2x Branded Fusion</strong> - The card to set up the board, summons using Deck, Hand or Field, best sends are Lubellion/Cartesia/Hex-Seal, for dark send Saronir.</p><p><strong>1x Branded Retribution</strong> - The best Turn 2 Set from Albion, Counter Trap is speed spell 3 meaning its very hard to react to, it negates a special summon and destroys the card, the cost is amazing, putting mirrorjade/albion/lubellion/any other albaz fusion monsters, 2 from the GY OR 1 from field. Then when in the GY it can add Branded Fusion straight back to your hand for amazing follow-up on turn 3.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>EXTRA DECK:</strong></em></span></p><p><strong>0-1x Guardian Chimera</strong> - Only good when made with Branded in Red, helps swing the game back in your favour with a pops and draw power.</p><p>(Cutable if you prefer not to play Branded in Red and add something else like me, i just think Talents is better).</p><p><strong>1x Invoked Mechaba</strong> - Uses a light monster either in your GY or opponents. Omni-negate and banish.</p><p><strong>1x Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> - Made with Hex-Light and any Dragon monster. Doesn't have onfield POP but has the omni-negate.</p><p><strong>1x Invoked Magistus Omega</strong> - Made with any ED monster, banishes monsters. When destroyed it summons Lv. 4 Spellcaster (Cartesia/Quem/Aleister) and equips to give 1k ATK.</p><p><strong>1x Mirrorjade The Iceblade Dragon</strong> - Non-targetting banish. Sends from ED to GY. When removed from field at the end phase destroy all monsters your opponent controls.</p><p><strong>1x Rindbrumm The Striking Dragon</strong> - Can be made using Mulcharmies/Gurara/Omega. Negates and Spins. Can summon itself or Albaz from GY on your oppoents turn.</p><p><strong>1x Invoked Audgoeides</strong> - Uses any fusion, pops any monster your opponent controls when summoned or when the opponent special summons. Can banish a fusion monster to gain ATK equal to the banish monster, making it great for beating over towers, getting easily over 4k ATK.</p><p><strong>1x Despian Quaeritis</strong> - Makes all monsters other than Lv. 8 or higher fusion monsters to 0, giving a safer out to monsters other than too many effects. When leaves the field, summons either Albaz or Despia = Quem/Aluber for extention.</p><p><strong>1-0x Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> - Any 2 Darks for Super Poly, gains ATK equal to one monster of the field, making it very good for beating over anyone, can copy the effect of any lv 5 or higher and when destroyed it wipes all opponents special summoned monsters.</p><p><strong>1x Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</strong> - Gains ATK equal to combined levels of monsters used for its summon. Often 12 = 2500+1200=3700. And is unaffected&nbsp; by ED monsters the turn its summoned, the best card into Dinomorphia. On endphase whilst its in GY you can summon Quem/Albaz.</p><p><strong>1x Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon</strong> - Best card Vs dragons, you can contact summon using fallen of albaz on field + all dragons on field and it gains attacks up to the number of fusion material used. on endphase add 1 polymerization or fusion normal spell. this includes, Branded Fusion/Fusion Deployment for extection.</p><p><strong>1x Granguignol the Dusk Dragon</strong> - Uses any light or dark. Sends any Bystial/Garura for combos. when your opponent special summons by monster effect summons either Quem/Quaritis.</p><p><strong>1-2x Albion the Branded Dragon</strong> - Banishes cards from hand, field, GY to fuse a lv. 8 or lower fusion. When in GY it sets a branded spell/trap. Can be tributed for Lubellion.</p><p><strong>1x Lubellion the Searing Dragon</strong> - Puts cards from field, GY or banished back into the deck to fusion.</p><p><strong>1x Garura Wings of Resonant Life</strong> - Super Poly target to out most decks, when sent to GY draws a card.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>Combos:</strong></em></span></p><p>Magical Meltdown &gt; Adds Aleister The Invoker &gt; NS &gt; Activate &gt; Adds Invocation</p><p>Branded Fusion &gt; Sending (Lubellion for Pure Bystial Branded, Hex-Light for Dragoon, Cartesia For Granguional)</p>"

(This time in GENESYS).,"<p>Kitkallos, you're as beautiful as the day that we've lost you... 🥹<br /><br />Although severly limited by the GENESYS points list with Scheiren and Kitkallos costing a whopping FIFTY POINTS apiece, (thus taking up this deck's entire points budget), Tearlaments is still an extremely powerful deck! Don't believe me? Check out my Youtube video below to see the deck in action!&nbsp;<br /><br />Experience the familiar dopamine high as you mill your entire deck to the graveyard, plussing a bazillion times like no tomorrow as you create an unbreakable board with the likes of Tearlaments Rulkallos (Summon negate), Tearlaments Cryme (Omni-negate shuffle), Tearlaments Sulliek (Monster negate), and Tearlaments Kaleidoheart (Target shuffle). <br /><br />This strategy also has access to a large synchro suite due to millable tuners as well as the Lightsworn engine! Genex Return Zero (Monster negate destroy for each attribute), Draco Berserker of the Tenyi (Monster banish), Juraishin (Monster of spell field wide destruction), Chengying (Monster banish) and Wolfrayet (Shuffle all monsters your opponent controls).&nbsp;<br /><br />For the counterattack, Tearlaments can field fearsome gigantic beatsticks like Liberator Eto (4000ATK) and Alba System (Can attack every monster once and its 4500ATK)!&nbsp;<br /><br />The main weakness of this deck is bricking and getting unlucky with mills. However, once the milling gets going, almost nothing stops Tearlaments from winning the game, especially in the lower power fomat of GENESYS! The combination of Scheiren, Kitkallos, TearKash and Scream mill 14 cards! The Lightsworn cards can also mill quite a bit as well, with both Minervas milling 7 cards and Weiss milling 2! It's often that after you end your turn, you may have only about 5-10 cards left in deck due to how much you mill, search and draw!&nbsp;<br /><br />Tearlaments in GENESYS functions as usual, milling as much as possible with the combined effort of the Tearlaments and Lightsworn cards. Make impenetrable boards going first and power through everything with immense amounts of milling going second with pure engine! Mill mill mill your way to victory!<br /><br />And remember... <strong><em>TIARAMENTS STRONGEST~</em></strong></p><p>(Shoutout to Lithium2300's Tearlament decklist and Youtube video for inspiring this deck!)<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!<br /><br /><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?
