Dustons are on the loose! GET THE VACUUM.","<p>Now that the genesys format is here, a lot of old archetypes that haven't gotten to see the light may get to rear their dusty heads. Dustons has never really gotten a chance to shine, especially since the release of Link monsters. Why give the opponent 5+ free materials that they can easily get rid of?</p><p>Well, without Link monsters and a general lowering power levels through Genesys Points, Dustons may just be able to snatch a win or two. Not tournament wins, like... single duel wins. Will this deck be able to compete against the top meta? Probably not, 1 or 2 disruptions would probably be enough to bury this troll deck. And it has no disruption, unless you side in Hand Traps. So what are the upsides of Dustons?</p><ol><li>Locks down the enemy's monster zones with worthless Duston monsters (and Ojama Trio in this version). Dustons can't be tributed or used as Fusion, Synchro or XYZ materials.</li><li>Starduston is an INCREDIBLE floodgate. The opponent can't Special Summon monsters or activate Set Spells or Traps.</li><li>OTK potential with both Starduston, Goblin King &amp; Slacker Magician. Battle Mania is needed, sometimes Ojama Trio/Duo.</li><li>Level 1 monsters have a lot of support with consistent searching, allowing you to set up your combo.</li><li>Pot of Extravagance provides some draw power with basically 0 downside, you barely use the Extra Deck.</li><li>Great Kaiju synergy going 2nd. You need to crash your monsters to do any combos. Stygian Security also helps with getting House Duston out there.</li><li>Simple Combo: crash/set House Duston &gt; flood the field &gt; summon Starduston (4000 ATK) / Goblin King / Slacker Magician</li><li>Multiple OTK angles, Starduston is the most common but you can use Goblin King &amp; Slacker Magician as well. Slacker Magician is one of the most interesting OTK angles this deck has going for it, since she can OTK if the opponent's field is flooded with Dustons / Ojamas and you have Battle Mania. She also has a lot of built-in protection. Problem with this angle is that the opponent's field will most likely be too flooded to even use Ojama Trio. Ojama Duo COULD work instead. The combo would go like this: Normal summon &amp; crash House Duston / Stygian Sentry &gt; Summon 2 Dustons to both sides of the field &gt; Summon Slacker Magician using 2 White Dustons &gt; Set Ojama Duo &amp; Battle Mania (Trap Trick replaces either of these) &gt; End Turn &gt; Standby Phase: activate Battle Mania.</li><li>Pot of Extravagance + Trap Trick gives higher odds of nailing the opponent with Battle Mania.</li><li>Deck has GREAT synergy with Ojama Trio/Duo, only problem is that they can be used for Synchros. The idea is that they can disrupt the enemy through filling their monster zones, as well as give you more bodies to force your opponent to crash with Battle Mania. It can also be searched with Trap Trick. If you don't wanna play Ojama Trio/Duo, you could try Unexpected Dai, Final Attack Orders or Kinka-Byo. There is definitely a Rank 1 XYZ angle with Kinka-Byo &amp; Unexpected Dai.</li><li>Rank 13 + 31 XYZ angle. Baby Tiragon + Goblin King is also interesting, but will only hit for 6000-7000 damage at most.</li><li>The deck is cheap!</li></ol><p>Sadly this deck has basically 0 proactive plays on Turn 1 except for setting a House Duston / Stygian Sentry / Ojama Trio &amp; passing. Thankfully House Duston triggers from card destruction effects as well, so that's nice.</p><p>The deck is also untested so take everything in here with a pinch of salt LMAO THANKS FOR READING SUCKER. Jokes aside, I'm most unsure about the Ojama Trio/Duo synergy. Might just be better to go more into the XYZ angle and dish out Number 13 + 31.</p><p>Ignore the Side Deck.</p>"
