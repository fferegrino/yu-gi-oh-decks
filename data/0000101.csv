When going first with this deck, you can side out <strong>Nibiru</strong> and <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> for <strong>Secret Village</strong> and <strong>Magician of Black Chaos Max</strong>. Despite this deck blinding second, <strong>Super Poly </strong>isn't main decked since your targets are only for specific match-ups.  <strong>Black Chaos Max</strong> makes it so that your opponent can't activate monster effects the turn it is summoned so you can shotgun into it on your opponent's turn with <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>. <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic </strong>however is your main fusion spell to go into your <strong>Dark Magician </strong>Fusions or <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> if you have turn something into a dragon monster with the effect of <strong>Dragoncaller Magician</strong>. But most of the time, you will be getting to <strong>Dragoon</strong> with <strong>The Eye of Timaeus </strong>it gets you one monster destruction per turn, but it's still a <strong>Dragoon</strong> on the field which takes a lot of effort to get off of the field. <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic </strong>can also get you a <strong>Starving Venom </strong><strong>Fusion Dragon</strong> during the battle phase to get the last bit of necessary damage that you need.  <strong>Dark Magic Circle</strong> is your main source of removal in your deck so its at three copies. <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> is a good card but the downside of blowing up your field when its destroyed makes it great at one copy per deck. <strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong> summons your one of <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong> (no need to play it at more than 1 copy) and searches a board wipe (<strong>Dark Burning Magic</strong>).  We are playing <strong>Dragoncaller Magician</strong> since it's pend effect make 1 monster you control a dragon monster and its monster effect makes itself a dragon monster so that you can hard make <strong>Dragoon</strong>. Also it has an effect do double the attack of a fusion, synchro, or xyz monster that used it as material when battling a dragon.  <strong>BLS Solder of Chaos</strong> is almost like a pseudo-<strong>Dragoon</strong> since it is pretty hard to get off the field. <strong>Borrelsword</strong> is for more damage. <strong>Daybreaker </strong>instead of <strong>Selene</strong> since we are not playing <strong>Endymion </strong>cards and also <strong>Daybreaker</strong> is a source of removal.<strong> Ebon High Magician</strong> floats into a spellcaster and it allows you to activate traps and quick play spells from your hand on your opponent's turn. <strong>Dracossack </strong>is a generic rank 7. <strong>Harmonizer Gradielle</strong> is a very unique card and aside from being a generic rank 7, it can be good against certain strategies.  We are not playing <strong>Apprentice Illusion Magician</strong> since this decks strategy is more reliant on the Extra Deck than overall field control with <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> and <strong>Dark Magic Circle</strong>. You could also play <strong>Chaos Space</strong> to search <strong>Magician of Black Chaos Max</strong> considering if you also play something like <strong>Psy-framegear Gamma </strong>or <strong>Palladium Oracle </strong><strong>Mahad.</strong>"

Hyper Librarian,"Off of 1 start you can discard 1, draw 6, and end on multiple negates + Dweller. Won't be legal in the TCG until Roland is printed, but you can run the same combo without Gearfried using Accel Synchron.  I came up with the Librarian combo first, initially out of Isolde. It uses all of your monster zones, including the extra monster zone, and ends on discard 1, draw 5, with Savage and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. However, it doesn't use your Boot Sector launch, meaning A) you end on quality negates and card draw before you need to Launch, and B) You can use Launch to start your combo off of any normal summon + a Rokket."

But, it fares well enough going second as well, but it does lose to like 1 negate against <strong>Hajun</strong> or <strong>Dakki</strong>.

You can play <strong>Dakki</strong> at 2, but it is such a big target for interruptions that having more than 1 is advised. Also, you can side out the <strong>Solitaires</strong> for things like <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> or <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> since the <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> path in this deck is lackluster. 3 <strong>Kinka-byo</strong> since you need to see those level 1 monsters those being <strong>Hajun</strong> and<strong> Yuki-Musume</strong>. 1 <strong>Shafu</strong> for recursion and 1 <strong>Pankratops</strong> since its a good card if you are forced to go second.  3 <strong>Mayakahsi Return</strong> since it is <strong>ROTA</strong> and <strong>Foolish</strong>. 3 <strong>Desires</strong> since draw power. 3 <strong>Where Arf Thou?</strong> since you need to have level 1 monsters in your opening. 3 <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong> to deal with backrow decks. <strong>One for One</strong> of course for the level 1 monsters. 3 <strong>Mayakashi Metamorphosis</strong> since it gets out a body and recycles your banished zombies. 1<strong> Mayakashi Mayhem</strong> just for some spice. You can probably play <strong>Mayakashi Winter</strong> instead if you want.

If that weren't the case, I'd play <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> or <strong>Avendread Savior</strong>. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong>. It's a good card, but its own archetype can't make it consistently. 1 <strong>Thousand-Eyes</strong> since its a level 1 that is removal and one that you can synchro with.

All its monsters pop out of your hand to play during the End Phase, and then jump back to the hand when frightened by attacks or summoned monsters, in order to call out more friends.  Unassuming at first, and seemingly an advantage engine without any way to capitalize off it... but under the surface, Melffy decks are a high-execution deck capable of controlling and wiping boards, playing a huge variety of different monsters, and taking advantage of Synchro, Xyz, and Link alike! Let's get into it and see just what they're capable of!  (Note: This is not a tier 1 deck, but I've endeavoured over the last few months to experiment with assorted Melffy builds, and I can guarantee you that this is probably one of the most powerful variants you'll find on here!)  <strong>Table Of Contents: </strong> <ol>  	<li><em>Melffy and You - A Guide To Your In-House Cards</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and Toolboxing - A Guide To Basic Control</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and the Extra Deck - A Guide to Closing Out Games</em></li>  	<li><em>Melffy and Variation - A Guide To Options And Side-Decking</em></li>  	<li><em>Final Notes</em></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and You -- A Guide To Your In-House Cards --</span></strong>  Melffy, as of now, is a deck composed of five Main Deck monsters (of which one is a vanilla), three Xyz Monsters, two spells, and a trap. This isn't the largest of archetypes, but with the consistency its two most important main deck monsters allow, it doesn't have to be. Let's take a look at them!  All main deck Melffy save Rabby (their vanilla) are <strong>LV2 EARTH Beasts</strong> (with nary any ATK or DEF) that share the same two effects, with hard Once Per Turn limits on each: During your End Phase, you can summon them from your hand, and when your opponent Summons a monster or declares an attack while you have Melffy on board, you can return them to your hand to do a certain effect. <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> is the strongest, <em>summoning from deck any Level 2 Beast</em>, including any of your other Melffy! Run three copies and never look back.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Cathy </strong>comes in second, <em>searching any Beast from deck.</em> Not just level 2 - ANY Beast. This allows for some very funny plays, as we'll look at later. You can argue anywhere from 1 to 3 copies of this, but I prefer to play 2-3.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Pony</strong> and <strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> are tied for the lesser of the four, respectively <em>getting a Level 2 beast from grave to hand</em> or <em>Special Summoning a beast from hand.</em> We run one of each, for toolbox utility - with Melffy Puppy, you only really need one.</li> </ul> Next up, a look at their Extra Deck friends... or at least, the ones that have ""Melffy"" in the name. Melffy have a <strong>lot</strong> of viable ED picks, as you'll see very soon... <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> is their flagship Xyz, allowing an <strong>inhouse omnisearcher once per turn</strong> (that can also grab backrow!), as well as a<strong> clunky but powerful Fiendish Chain when you bounce a Melffy back to hand.</strong> This can't stop on-summon effects like a Halqifibrax or Conquistador activation, but it can lock down almost any other monster! Run 1-3.</li>  	<li><strong>Excited Melffy </strong>(translation not official) is their newest piece of support, and at 2000 ATK their only real in-house attacker. Its first effect, <strong>being able to detach a material to grant Melffy direct attacks,</strong> is mostly useless given the archetype's low statline, but it's got a niche usage of setting up <strong>Negalogia AA-Zeus</strong> plays (more on this later). Its second effect, however, is far more important - being able to <strong>bounce a Melffy Xyz back to the Extra Deck to revive Melffy up to its materials! </strong>The full use of this ability will be discussed in full a bit later, but keep it in mind for now. Run 1, I'd say.</li>  	<li>And, uh... <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> is bad. Sorry, but she's just not good! At 2 materials she's a 1000 atk waste of space, and if you get her up to 5 materials you get... a worse Yubel. Which was a card released in 2007/2008. Run 0.</li> </ul> Finally, let's look at their in-house backrow! <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Tag</strong> is a <em>quick-play, archetype-locked Monster Reborn.</em> This allows for a searchable revive at any time, even of your Xyz Monsters - and sets up a one-card <strong>Utopic Future Dragon</strong> play, as will be discussed later. It also allows for Zeroboros interaction, extra material, and simply getting your Puppy or Cathy back on the board when you need them. Run however many you wish, but I lean towards 2.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Hide-And-Seek</strong> is a rather unique continuous spell. <em>It grants all of your beasts protection from effect destruction once per turn</em>, and also lets you <em>shuffle three beasts from grave to deck once per turn to draw a card.</em> Against decks that can't threaten your backrow efficiently, Hide-And-Seek (which I'll refer to as HAS) can <strong>constantly shuffle your Rescue Cats and garnets back into deck while gaining you advantage</strong> - and against decks that can, you can still just search it out to essentially turn Melffy of the Forest's effect into a recycle and a draw. Run any amount - some decks run 0, others run 3, I personally run 2.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Time</strong> is their only trap, and lets them remove materials from an Xyz to bounce to hand other cards on the field, as well as granting that Xyz 500 ATK for each during that turn only. It's... well, it's not good. At 1 material (such as with a Forest that's used its effect already), it's a 1-for-1 that only bounces to hand. Given this is a trap, it's inherently slow and prone to destruction, and the ATK boost will never matter since it's miniscule and you're probably using this on your foe's turn. Run 0 - you have far better disruption choices.</li> </ul> So that's all the Melffy. Now, the part you've been waiting for - <em>how do I use these?</em>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and Toolboxing -- A Guide to Basic Control --</span></strong>  The bread and butter of the Melffy archetype is making <strong>simple boards with a ton of recursion and disruption,</strong> locking the opponent out and then beating them down in the grind game. They function best going first, though they can also work going second if they need to. To understand the potential of Melffy, we first have to take a look at what their two ace main deck monsters - Puppy and Cathy - can grab. So let's do that!  <strong>-Puppy's Pals-</strong> are few, but crucial. <ul>  	<li><strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> is Puppy's best friend. <strong>When it's summoned by a beast, you can pop a card on the field.</strong> Yes, that's all it does - simple, reliable, on-summon removal. Time your Kalantosa summon just right, and you can nip your opponent's combo in the bud - have a Melffy of the Forest on the field, and you can negate a second monster along with it! Plus, you can use the Kalantosa for summons later. Run at least 1, but numbers vary - do you want to run multiple and potentially clog up your hand, or do you want to run 1 and risk it being banished or otherwise unavailable? Personally, I run 2.</li>  	<li><strong>All of the other Melffy</strong> can be searched, and then proceed to fire their own effects the next time an opponent summons. This is great if your Kalantosas are locked in your hand and you need Fenny, or if you need Pony to grab something important from the grave.</li>  	<li><strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong>is a tuner that can also discard dead cards in hand to revive beasts, letting you go into a Melffy Xyz or a level 4 synchro. It's not as useful on the opponent's turn, but if you manage to trigger Puppy during your turn, it can be smart.</li>  	<li>Finally, if you don't need any of them, <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> can summon a second copy of itself from hand or grave when it hits the field, granting you extra material. It's very useful as a combo extender for other reasons, as we'll talk about later. I like running two of these.</li> </ul> <strong>-Cathy's Comrades-,</strong> not limited by the Level 2 restriction Puppy has, are far more numerous, to the point where choosing which to search smartly can separate victory from defeat. <ul>  	<li><strong>Rescue Cat</strong> is an absurdly powerful searcher (albeit one that takes up your normal summon), and can act as a searchable one-card setup for multiple monsters. You can even recycle it with HAS later to do it all over again! Run threeeee.</li>  	<li>But if you're looking for something more immediately useful, <strong>Hop-Ear Squadron</strong> can use itself from hand and a Beast on field to Accel Synchro during your opponent's turn, letting you immediately transform that Kalantosa on board into a <strong>Herald of the Arc Light </strong>for massive disruption.</li>  	<li><strong>Danger! Bigfoot!</strong> is a thoroughly amusing option. Melffy can have trouble putting BIG NUMBER on the board and making spot removal besides Kalantosa, so having a way to cover both of those, get garnets out of hand, gain material, and cycle through your deck all in one is fantastic. Run 0-3, it's really up to you and can vary based on what Melffy variant you're running.</li>  	<li><strong>Valerifawn</strong> is an option, but is typically outclassed by Rescue Cat.</li>  	<li>Once again, <strong>any other</strong> <strong>Melffy </strong>can also be searched, so if you have Cathy and really, <em>really</em> need Puppy, you can do that. Or just get it through Forest instead.</li> </ul> With Puppy and Cathy on board, you can easily pivot into destruction, negates, prep for your next turn... they're the dynamic duo of the deck, but they're not enough by themselves. How do you get them on board reliably? How do you make a board besides them?  Let's take a look at our summoning suite and how to use them. <ul>  	<li><strong>Rescue Cat</strong> we've already talked about, but a closer dive into it is important. It's searchable, has little to no limitations, and can make on the spot anything from a Naturia Beast to a Utopic Future Dragon based on the situation. In order to make the most out of it, we run two level 3 semi-garnets - <strong>Peropero Cerperus</strong>, which is a destruction enabler while in grave, and more importantly <strong>Mine Mole, </strong>which gives you a free draw whenever you perform a Synchro Summon with it. This makes Rescue Cat plus out of its mind.</li>  	<li><strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> is a lot more spicy. You need to have no monsters on field to use it, and it only gets level 2s, and it locks you into only Beast monsters from the Extra Deck... but in return, it doesn't take up your Normal Summon, and gets you three monsters. You'll typically want to grab <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> so as to get one into your graveyard (or get 4 for the price of 3 if you have one in grave already), but the other two monsters you summon are up to you. <ul>  	<li><strong>Notably, with both Obedience Schooled and Rescue Cat, the effects of the monsters you summon are negated, and they die at the End Phase.</strong> This has some unique and not readily apparent synergies with HAS and Excited Melffy - the first will protect all of them from that destruction, letting you keep them on board for later material.. and the latter you can make using whatever you summoned and then convert it into the Melffy you summoned during the next turn, <strong>with their effects back</strong>! This can be a nasty surprise for enemies not expecting you to drop Puppy and Cathy onto your board out of nowhere!</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> is the odd summon out. By targeting a Level 2 EARTH Beast, you can get two more from your deck... but at the cost of 2000 LP and locking you out of Special Summoning for the rest of your turn. It's an ideal way to end your combos - after doing everything you wanted, target a piece of material on board and drop two Melffy directly from deck, ready to plus you all the way to a victory the next turn.</li>  	<li>We've mentioned <strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong> a lot so far, so it's worth going over momentarily - when it's summoned, you get to summon another Baby Tiger from hand or graveyard. If you set one up in the grave with one of the above cards early, every time you summon it again you'll gain free material, letting you extend your combos beyond what Melffy would normally be limited to.</li> </ul> As you can see, this gives your deck a lot of summon flexibility. This variant of the deck runs 3 Obedience, 3 Cat, and 2 Ties, all but guaranteeing you'll see a few of them in your opening hand. You can open with Obedienced... then if your opponent negates it, fire off another one, or maybe a Rescue Cat, keeping the pressure on any deck that doesn't create a million negates.  Now that you've seen how Melffy can keep control of the board, why don't we look at... their Extra Deck options?  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and the Extra Deck -- A Guide on Closing Out Games --</span></strong>  I will level with you - Melffy have a TON of Extra Deck options. Between Synchro, Xyz, and Link, many doors are open to them, and their toolboxing nature wants them to keep as many of those doors open as possible, so there's a lot of room for variation. But we'll go over the picks that this deck runs, in order to get a look at how the deck plays. Also worth noting is that Obedience Schooled locks you out of anything but Beasts if it resolves, so if you've used it this turn, you'll have to make a board of the Melffy Xyz and perhaps a Missus Radiant, Sandayu, or Naturia synchro. Keep that in mind!  We'll start with the most important facet of their extra deck, and their main way to finish games with a bang: their two big non-Melffy Xyz Monsters!  <strong><span>-- The Xyz --</span></strong>  <strong>Number F0:</strong> <strong>Utopic Future</strong> and <strong>Utopic Future Dragon </strong>have been mentioned a few times during this guide, and for good reason. You can make them of any two non-Number Xyz of the same rank (so, your Melffy Xyz), and each has a powerful effect. <em>Utopic Future takes control of monsters it attacks during the battle phase,</em> letting you steal lethal if the opponent's trying to sit on one BIG monster, but the more notable one is Utopic Future Dragon - an <strong>indestructible 3000 ATK beater </strong><strong>that can negate any monster effect... and then STEAL that monster,</strong> if it was on the opponent's board!  Summoning these in this deck becomes immensely simple if you have a copy of Excited Melffy or Melffy of the Forest in the Graveyard. Simply summon Rescue Cat (or Baby Tiger if you already have one in the graveyard), granting you the two material for Melffy of the Forest. Use its effect to search a copy of Melffy Tag, reviving the other Xyz from the graveyard. You only used one card from hand, and you now have all the material you need to summon your Future Dragon!  --  If Utopic Future Dragon was the big bad payoff for Forest, <strong>Negalogia AA-Zeus</strong> is the payoff for Excited Melffy. You can summon it using an Xyz Monster if you attacked with an Xyz Monster that turn... and oh, would you look at that, Excited Melffy lets itself direct attack! This lets you easily create a 3000 ATK beater that can wipe the entire board (and it doesn't destroy, so it gets around pesky destruction-immune things) quite easily.  --  We also have one other Xyz - <strong>Number 64: Ronin Racoon Sandayu</strong> creates powerful tokens that can copy your other big Xyz Monsters' ATK stats, clash into enemy monsters, or be used as material. It's also a Beast, letting you have more options while locked under Obedience - just remember since it's a Number, you can't use it to make Utopic Future.  Next up is their midrange options - Synchro Monsters!  <strong><span>-- The Synchros --</span></strong>  <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> is a very, very good card, and you'll be making it off Kalantosa and Hop-Ear a <em>lot.</em> It locks off any deck that wants to discard or Foolish, and can also tribute itself to negate and destroy, well... essentially any effect! These two abilities make it something that's easy to make and useful in almost any circumstance, albeit one with very frail ATK and DEF. <span>It also searches for Ritual cards when sent to the graveyard, TEMPTING you to give in to the jank and play Ritual Melffy, no matter how idiotic and janky it may be... (Note: Do not do this.) <span>Overall, it's really good, and you can run anywhere between 1 and 3 of it, depending on how much Extra Deck space you're willing to allot.</span></span>  <strong>Old Entity Hastorr</strong> is a bit of a weird one. It's a decent body against lower ATK decks, and when it's destroyed by an enemy card, it becomes a Fiendish against an enemy monster that also lets you steal that monster if it's destroyed. It's mostly a way to deal with decks that Herald can't touch - they can't walk over it as easily, and have to deal with consequences if they do. You can cut it if you want, but I've found some nice success with it.  --  <strong>Naturia Beast,</strong> however, <strong>is not a Hop-Ear summon but a Rescue Cat play!</strong> It needs an EARTH Tuner, meaning your Valerifawn, but at the cost of milling two cards can <strong>negate and destroy... <em>ANY</em> Spell Card.</strong> Yes. <em>Any</em> of them. Any amount of times per turn. This is useful against countless decks - locking off Field Spells, stopping Extravagance draws, countering combos.... You can make it easily by playing Rescue Cat and searching for Valerifawn and either Mine Mole (which lets you draw) or Peropero Cerperus (for later destruction).  You've also got <strong>Naturia Barkion</strong>, its Trap-killing equivalent, hidden in the Side Deck (along with a lv 3 tuner to make it doable with only two material off Cat). The reason it's not in the main Extra Deck is because, unlike what Big Eldlich might attempt to convince you of, most decks don't run many Traps! Plus, it banishes from grave instead of milling as cost, meaning it's more difficult to sustain. Still, spec it in whenever you need it.  Now, onto the last part of the extra deck - the Links!  <strong><span>-- The Links --</span></strong>  The main reason why Links work well with Melffy is because of <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. As Melffy summon themselves during your End Phase and mainly activate during your foe's turn, you can find that while you have a ton of advantage, you can't find a way to actually use it for anything... <strong>Masquerena solves that problem, letting you Link Summon in the midst of your opponent's plays to disrupt them!</strong>  Extra Deck room is tight, so we only really run three Links to capitalize off this, but they're still very good! <ul>  	<li><strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> spins whatever it wants back to deck, helping grab those things out of reach by Kalantosa.</li>  	<li><strong>Topologic Zeroboros</strong> bombs the field the moment something plays next to where a Link points - by using a Melffy Puppy or Melffy Tag to summon something to its linked zones, you can banish the opponent's field on either player's turn, while still letting Zeroboros serve as a beater!</li>  	<li>Finally, <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is indestructible by battle or effects when made via I:P, and can easily wipe out enemies by itself.</li> </ul> Additionally, we have<strong> Missus Radiant</strong>, who is... I'll level with you, it's not great. It only gives your monsters an ATK boost, and recycles an EARTH monster from grave after it leaves the field. However, it's the only Link you can make under Obedience locks, so it's useful nonetheless.  --  That's it. You've now seen practically all this Melffy deck has to offer - recursion, advantage, field wipes, and more on-opponent's-turn effects than you can shake a stick at.  And yet, we're not done! Melffy have so many different options, deckbuild types, and side deck choices to keep in mind that there's probably no limit on varieties of this deck that can be made! Let's close out this guide by taking a close look at them!  &nbsp;  <strong><span>-- Melffy and Variations -- A Guide to Options and Side-Decking --</span></strong>  First of all, we should cover this deck's primary three weaknesses.  <strong>Melffy has a problem with high ATK monsters. </strong>Anything above 3000 ATK that's resistant to destruction will need some smart plays to overcome - perhaps nuking the board with Zeroboros, or stealing that monster to take game early with Utopic Future.  <strong>Melffy also has a problem with boards that pump out a mass of negates.</strong> Reusable negates, in particular, hurts the deck bad - since their plays are spread out across both their own turn and their foe's turn, OPT negation effects become far stronger than they normally would be.  <strong>Finally, Melffy has a problem with things that stop them from gaining field presence.</strong> If your normal summoned Rescue Cat is negated, and you don't have an Obedience Schooled, you might be limited to just playing Puppy/Cathy from hand on end phase and passing, and that's often not enough.  In order to subvert these problems, adding in hand traps, tech cards, and utilising Side Deck space can be crucial. Dark Ruler No More in the Side Deck helps you go second, as does Evenly Matched and Nibiru. 3 Called by the Grave in the main deck cuts down renegade Ash Blossoms (of which you have some of your own, for if you're going second and can't make your disruption), and two Three Tactical Talents lets you further capitalize if you're up against a deck playing a lot of negates.  I also am currently running Effect Veiler for more disruption on the foe's turn, but that's a matter of choice, as is most of these - the world of Yu-Gi-Oh is vast, and there's many other tech choices to subvert the weaknesses of the Melffy!  Now, let's take a look at some other Side Deck cards, Melffy variants, and other choices that may not have made it into this decklist. <ul>  	<li><strong>Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree</strong> is a Level 10 Synchro with <em>juuuust </em>over 3000 ATK and targeting immunity as long as it's not your MP2. You can make it easily with Danger! Bigfoot! and Hop-Ear (or Valerifawn) and it's annoying to get rid of, so you can run it if you want.</li>  	<li><strong>A larger Danger! package</strong> can also be considered, including Danger! Jackalope! as another Beast-type searchable off Cathy, but I tested it and found it not really worth it - 3 Bigfoot covers yourself nicely enough.</li>  	<li><strong>The Fabled Cerburrel </strong>is a Level 2 Tuner that summons itself when discarded! If you're running more copies of Twin Twister or the aforementioned Danger package, you can use it as a way to get free material if you find yourself discarding reliably. Keep in mind that since it's LIGHT, you can't summon Naturia Beast with it. <span>If you really want to be spicy, you can proceed to run <strong>The Fabled Unicore</strong>, which negates all enemy cards and destroys them while each player has even amounts of cards in hand, and use discard effects and Melffy self-bouncing to try and match hands. It's not good, but it IS funny.</span></li>  	<li><strong>Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</strong> is a 2250ATK mechlad that can be dropped from the hand if either player summons a monster from the Main Deck (HINT: PUPPY). You can then summon a monster from your Deck with DEF equal to an enemy monster's ATK and with a matching attribute - this sounds absurdly specific, and it <em>is</em>, but there's a lot of format-specific jank you can pull with it, so keep it in mind!</li>  	<li><strong>Closed Forest</strong> stops your opponent from using Field Spells as long as it's around (and for a turn if it's popped). It's a silver bullet, and you can cut it for more Side Deck room, but it IS hilarious when it works.</li>  	<li><strong>Tribrigade Melffy</strong> is a deck hybrid that can work pretty okay. It does run into problems with Obedience Schooled, so cut that down if you want to use it, but it's still good... though you should probably run a different Tribrigade variant, at that point.  Out of the two pure beast Tribrigades, <strong>Tribrigade Ceras</strong> can summon itself by discarding (something something Cerburrel synergy?!), and can use your graved Beasts and Beast-alikes to Link Summon, which is cool, but means you can't use that graveyard stuff for Melffy Tag or HAS or the like. <strong>Tribrigade </strong><strong>Felidgette, the Fruitless Flower</strong> is an interesting Missus Radiant alternative, offering summoning from hand and a janky hand-cycling effect in place of Missus's attack boosting and grave recycling. Either of these can be run as tech choices in a ""pure Melffy"" deck like this one if you want!</li>  	<li>You can run a <strong>Melffy Ojama</strong> build if you want, but I find that typically Ojama have better things to hybrid with and better ways to mass-search themselves in archetype with tools like Ojamatch and Ojamagic, and Melffy have better things they could be searching than mostly-Normal monsters.</li>  	<li>Of the other things you can search with Melffy Cathy, there's two main notable ones - <strong>Red Hared Hasty Horse</strong> is a decent body that's easy to summon, easy material, and can help you steal lethal even earlier alongside Excited Melffy. More notably, however, <strong>King Tiger</strong> <strong>Wanghu </strong>is a <em>hilarious</em> stun piece, outright declaring ""no, you lose"" to decks that run mostly monsters under 1400 ATK in the Main Deck and have no ways to out it.</li>  	<li><strong>Super Rush Recklessly</strong> was a stun choice I ran in previous variants of Melffy. It's a trap that lets you destroy a beast you control to spin an enemy's card back to the Deck... but since it needs that destruction to happen in order for the spin to trigger, it whiffs if you have a HAS on the board, and since it's a trap, it's slow and vulnerable to destruction. If you're not running HAS, though, feel free to take it for a... spin.</li>  	<li>Since Negalogia AA-Zeus can attach monsters from your Extra Deck when a card you control is destroyed, you can run a single copy of <strong>Elder Entity N'tss </strong>to allow pops if Negalogia goes down.</li>  	<li>If you really want to run <strong>Melffy Rabby</strong> for the cute factor of it, you can do it alongside <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong>, but I find it's bricky and a little redundant when you already have Rescue Cat.</li> </ul> <strong><span>-- Final Notes --</span></strong>  And... that's it. You should now have a comprehensive idea on how to start up, use, and experiment with a Melffy tempo deck! The Melffy archetype is an adorable font of potential and interesting deck strategies, and I've honestly loved experimenting with it ever since the first cards were shown in Japan - if it gets more new cards in the future, I'll be sure to take a look at them! I hope reading this has convinced you to take a trek through the Forest as well, and see just what interesting choices you can find there!  I'd like to thank <a>QuincyMcCoy</a> from the YGOrganization on the idea to use Amazoness Baby Tiger - he makes fantastic creative deck build ideas, be sure to check them out! Additionally, if you'd like to check out a completely different but still unique and powerful Melffy deck idea, why not go look at <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/melffy-combo-fibrax-and-the-friends-of-the-forest/"">Renren's Halqifibrax build?</a>  Thank you for reading! If you've come this far and enjoyed this deep dive into the archetype, a like or comment would be thoroughly appreciated! Ciao!"

At the same time Ancient Cloak, Silent Boots","My favorite character archetype empowered with Sacred Beast engine makes it super viable because it's a 1 card Curious Lightsworn which is Beatrice+Dante combined, although we dont need the Dante effect lol. Combo: <a>https://bit.ly/305LVHz</a>  All we need is <strong>1 Sacred Beast engine (Dark Beckoning/Spirit Gates) + 1 random PK</strong>. After having Dark Beckoning + Chaos Summoning on field, make Linkuriboh, use Spirit gates discard PK ss Chaos Summoning, make Relinquished Anima, make Curious dump PK (Tear Scale/Ancient Cloak, depends on what u need), use Ancient Cloak add Silent Boots, ss Tear Scale from GY, use Tear Scale discard 1 card dump Ragged Glove, ss Silent Boots, make Leviair, use Leviair detach Silent Boots ss Ancient Cloak, use Ragged Glove dump Fog Blade, use Fog Blade ss Silent Boots, make 2nd Leviair, use Leviair ss Ragged Glove, make Apollousa using Curious+Ragged Glove, make F0 using 2 Leviair, use Silent Boots add Fog Blade.  Pay attention to what PK we have in hand and GY, cus all is hopt and <strong>dont overdump/overextend our resource</strong>. Going second you can Accesscode (replacing Apollousa) + F0 for OTK. The card ratio is explainable, 3 Tear Scale (starter, combo piece, extender, best card), 3 Silent Boots (best extender, Fog Blade grind game), 2-3 Ancient Cloak (combo pieces, grind game, but bad starter), 1-2 Ragged Glove (extra copy of any PK, but bad starter), Stained Greave (worst PK, consider to cut it out), 3 Fog Blade (negate atk and eff, revives PK). I dont play the Rank-Up-Magic as it is slow and we have Accesscode which is better for OTK/wiping board. The Break Sword lineup is perfect cus it revives 2 and you can either follow it up with Raiders' Knight (for more Break Sword) or Knightmare Unicorn/Accesscode.  Sacred Beast engine is standard, 3 Dark Beckoning, 3 Spirit Gates, 1 Chaos Summoning. Just draw either 1 of Dark Beckoning or Spirit Gates and it's GG. All the staples are depending on matchup (Numeron Eldlich I'm looking at you) while being lv3 for rank3 synergy. Bammboozling is there for early negation or if we run out of resource, kinda better than Number 3: Cicada King cus Cicada doesnt negate handtrap. Borreload as another good dark link for non-targeting/destruction.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/pIZiwmx.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Salamangreat strong level, multiple negations, big monster, can OTK, super recursive, and big staple slot.  Cons: Only has monster negation.  <img src=""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w6VmtiK__Rk/maxresdefault.jpg"" alt=""image"" />"

The main strategy of this deck is to get Madam Verre and Haine on the board, and shut down your opponents plays.  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  Big Witches - The bosses of the deck, you'll be sitting on these for most of the game. Discards a spell to activate their effects. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Madam Verre - Not only used to beef up your other Witches, she can also negate the effects of all monsters face up on the field. Probably the best Witch in the deck.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Haine - Makes other Witches untargetable, and can pop a card on the field. The second best Witch in the deck</li> </ol> Baby Witches - These witches can tribute themselves and discard a spell to summon another Witch from the deck. Normally a Big Witch, but they can special each other too. You want to see these in your opening hand most often. They also all have unique grave effects. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Schmietta (3x) - Easily the best Baby Witch. Best stats out of all the others, and more importantly, her grave effect allows you to send a Witchcrafter card from your deck to the grave.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Pittore (2x) - Her grave effect allows you to draw a card, and the discard isn't usually a big deal since your spells add themselves back to your hand. Also used to dump your other Baby Witches.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Potterie - Used mostly when you're running out of steam, her grave effect only works when you have no cards in your hand. Allows you to add a Witch from your grave to your hand, most often a Baby Witch.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Genni (2x) - The second best Baby Witch, her grave effect allows her to banish a Witchcrafter spell and copy its effect. Allows you to use the same spell effect multiple times in one turn.</li> </ol> Other - <ol>  	<li>Ash Blossom (3x) - Pretty self explanitory, can be replaced pretty easily with Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence (I'd totally run this if I could afford it). We run a reasoning, and Ash Blossom is an awkward summon off of that, but otherwise insanely good.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong>Spell/Traps</strong>  Witchcrafter Spell/Traps - All Witchcrafter Spells (minus Bystreet) share the same effect - adding itself from your grave to your hand if you haven't activated its effect this turn. Bystreet and Patronus have different effects, but still do things in the grave. <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Creation (3x) - Searches a Witch from your deck. Usually used to fetch a Baby Witch, however can also be used with Unveiling to summon a Big Witch. Pretty self explanitory.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Holiday (3x) - Monster Reborn for Witches. Also pretty self explanatory, we only run one copy of each Big Witch, so this is used to bring them back.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Unveiling (3x) - Specials a Witch from your hand, and stops your opponent from activating anything in response to spellcaster effects. The second effect is relevant since its a quick play spell, making your opponent unable to interrupt your effects on their turn. If you decide to run Effect Veiler, they cannot chain Called by the Grave to its activation after you play this card, which sometimes comes up.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Draping - Bounces spell/traps, quite useful when pushing for game.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Collaboration - Allows a Witch to attack twice, as well as stopping spell/trap effects until the end of damage step. When combined with Madame Verre's attack boost, this can deal absurd damage.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Bystreet - The only continuous Witchcrafter spell we run, and protects your Witches from destruction. Can be send from the field to the grave to activate any of the discarding effects, and places itself back on the field during the end phase. You'll be dumping this with Schmietta quite often.</li>  	<li>Witchcrafter Patronus - Used to recycle Witches, and search other spells. Its grave effect allows you to add any of your banished spells from Genni/any of your opponents effects.</li> </ol> Other spells - <ol>  	<li>Reasoning - All of the Witches are different levels, meaning you normally get a free summon off this card. We run a low monster count and a high spell count, as well as your Witch spells adding themselves to your hand in the end phase, meaning this card is perfect for this deck.</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial - Used to dump Baby Witches, normally Schmietta, so you can use their grave effects.</li>  	<li>Metalfoes Fusion - You'll find yourself discarding your spells often, making this card a free draw.</li>  	<li>Monster Reborn - Self explanatory</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave (3x) - Also self explanatory, used to stop any hand traps/grave effects your opponent uses.</li>  	<li>Instant Fusion - Used to summon Thousand-Eyes Restrict for removal, Millennium-Eyes Restrict to stop any hand traps/effects on your turn, and rarely Winda to stop any special summoning.</li>  	<li>Magician's Restage - Can be used as a Monster Reborn for most of your Baby Witches, but is a little hard to get off the field. If you discard this for any of your Witches effects, it searches one of the Magician's Hands.</li>  	<li>Magician's Left/Right Hand - The Left Hand negates the first trap that activates, and the Right hand negates the first Spell. I've found the Right Hand to be better normally, but having both on the field can be a nightmare for your opponent.</li> </ol> <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Honestly, the Extra Deck doesn't matter too much in this deck. Winda and the Restrict fusions are there for Instant Fusion, and the Selene/Accesscode Talker combo is strong. Normally, you'll not be going into your Extra however.  &nbsp;  Honestly, I didn't expect to type up this much stuff on this deck, it just kinda happened. This is probably one of the more fun decks I've been playing recently, and I hope you all enjoy it too!"

Otherwise, you're just leaving a large beatstick out with no protection or disruptions.  &nbsp;  As for its nuking effect, if you use it and send Urgent Schedule to the Graveyard while it's Set, you can use Urgent Schedule's floating effect to search a Level 10 Machine. Similarly, if Super Express Bullet Train is sent to the Graveyard, whether by being detached from AA-Zeus or by its effect, Bullet Train's effect can add a Machine from your Graveyard to your hand.  &nbsp;  And I'm not gonna lie.

The four-star XYZ cards are interchangeable and easy to summon, if you pull the seventh on turn one number 99 will mitigate the poo of that, he also makes it easier for that occasional cxyz. There are too many great rank 8s, I like these. I don't much care for bringing out Cyber Dragon, so It isn't in here. It's a great card tho. Anyway, galaxy soldier is purely a search, it can be used as fodder for the single link card or be fodder for Hyper Galaxy etc combos expedition. The link card is great support all around, Gives you a card and whatnot, advances plays, disrupts etc. But the xyzs are better, that's why I only have 1.

Reggarding the Sacred Beasts package, this deck doesn't play Uria at all, as it makes it less competitive. The main beaters/win conditions are of course Hamon and Raviel, played at 2 each of them because drawing 1 is always nice for starting your combos to summon them and to have several copies to respond if they are destroyed or banished. Not much to explain about the ratios of Beckoning and Summoning beasts but remark that the Dark Summoning Beast is played at 2 because it might be a brick if drawn alone without any of the other ones, so I decided to cut it to 2. Necessary the Seven Gates at 3 and the Fallen paradise at 2 (as it is searcheable by the effects of many cards of the archetype).  This profile also includes 2 copies of Effect Veiler, for slowing down your opponent combos or stop monster effects that could remove your sacred beasts from your field/game if fallen paradise isn't active. I also play 1 copy of the <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair as it is an incredible tech for a deck based in sacrifying dark monsters to summon your main boss monsters (Raviel and Hamon), it cannot be tributed nor targeted by card effects (nice protection) and it comes back from the graveyard each time you tribute a dark monster.</a>  Reggarding the spells played in the deck, the Pots are the best solution to the consistency problem of the deck which, in my opinion, is the main problem this deck has and playing both at 3 it is quite fixed. Foolish Burial at 1, as it can help you to start the combo for summoning the Sacred Beasts at mid-late game if you send the proper monster to the graveyard. Finally, reggarding the spells, something that must be always played in decks that aim to compete against meta strategies is 2xMystic mine + 1x Set rotation... I mean, you won't understand how helpful this is until you play it. If your field is cleaned and you need time to recover yourself to start again with the combos for summoning Hamon and Raviel, the mystic mine is your best ally.  To end with the main deck, you play 3 copies of the Awakening of the Sacred Beast, card that in the field, together with any Sacred beast will give you a lot advantage + life points recovery. Furthermore you play some techs in order to take control of the game such as Crackdown at 3, completely necessary in a deck which might have problems to summon monsters if combos are stopped, so you can protect yourself from direct attacks by takig your opponent big monsters. I have also decided to play There can be only one at 3 because it is the best card to compete against the meta nowadays and it doesn't enter in conflict with your main win condition which is having Hamon and Raviel on the field (there's no conflict with Diabolos either). Finally you play a copy of Skill Drain, because once your sacred beasts are summoned and protected by the fallen paradise, this card will almost lock your opponent out of the game.  Finally I want to remark that you might think that some cards such as Mystic Mine, There can Be Only One or Skill Drain might enter in conflict with your own strategy, but you must remember always something: You decide when to play your own cards, not your opponent. Knowing the deck you play in depth and making the combos/plays with good tempo might give you games which at some point you could think they are lost.  &nbsp;"

Consistency: 70% - 80% (bad hands happen sometimes, it is a fun deck, needs additional support to make it more meta worthy).  Normal Summons: Elemental Hero Stratos - Searches Adusted Gold from the deck + other HERO monsters.

Also added card trader, since some cards will not allow you to continue drawing later, having more than one in the hand at the time, can be detrimental, so card trader fixes that, hope you guys like it.

Requires 2 bricks in the extra deck and only makes Savage if you see 1 extender, but you reliably do make Apollousa + Winda + Savage.  Changed Qadshaddol Keios for Shaddoll Beast. If you leave the Union Carrier on the table and destroy Beast with Tracer's effect you draw a card! You can also still clear the Carrier and forgo the draw. This works because you don't use Verte Anaconda until after you make Borrelsword. Yay free draw.  Upped the card count to increase the odds of seeing hand traps, and increased extenders accordingly."

These are all good cards for getting to your mystic mine.  Obviously a win condition is needed, so we have 3 cauldrons, a wave motion and a final countdown.  Silent Wobby is a card that you can put on your opponent's field in order to keep your mystic  mine alive.

Going 2nd:  Proc all of your effects before activating Numeron Network. EG: Special summon your Kaiju's now, use lightning storm, this baits any negates and also plays around the fact that you can only summon once after activating your Numeron effects (which will always be RA).  Activate Numeron Network.  Special summon 3 Numeron XYZ's (4 sets you up for NIBIRU but if they don't have it it is strictly better- you will draw 1x more with cards of hope)  You now have extremely powerful <strong>DRAW</strong> options-  Hand destruction (Drop RA (you can search him from grave) or Guardian Slime (lets you search blaze accelerator/ancient chant- you always need BOTH of these cards))  Memories of Hope (draw 4)  Allure of Darkness (may now banish your useless dark monsters- game will be over in 1 turn).  Pot of Desires (be careful not to banish both RA)  Card destruction lets you cycle guardian slime and draw into memories of hope 1x/turn.  <hr />  The OTK:  You have 3-4 Numeron XYZ on the field  You have more then enough draw engines in the deck to get all of the cards you want:  Activate ""Ancient Chant"" to add Ra and then activate it's effect from the graveyard  Summon RA (activate it's effect- will be at 3000 + 7900 attack)  Activate blaze cannon and target Ra to make it immune to enemy card effects  Then proceed to attack the enemy Kaiju, any of their monsters under 2900 attack, or activate ""Action Magic - Double Banking"" to allow Ra to attack twice.  <hr />  Want better first turn odds?

I have done 200+ test hands, and at least 2/3 of them have ended with 3 interruptions. I also own Bagooska and Abyss Dweller, so please let me know if either of those should replace Tornado Dragon.

First Triamids have field spells that gain value from being sent from the field to the Graveyard; cards like <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> provides an extra way to pop your field spells. Both Archetype also have some mutually beneficial cards such as <a data-name=""Magicians’ Souls"">Magicians’ Souls</a>, which lets you cycle spell cards with grave effects, and <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>, which lets you set up powerful locks with the barrier statues.  <span><strong>How does the deck Play?</strong></span>  The Evil Eye Half of the deck is played very similarly to the popular Invoked engine. Using the field spell: <a data-name=""Evil Eye Domain – Pareidolla"">Evil Eye Domain – Pareidolla</a> to search <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> to search either <a data-name=""Evil Eye of Selene"">Evil Eye of Selene</a> for a special summon destruction or <a data-name=""Evil Eye Retribution"">Evil Eye Retribution</a> for a spell/trap negate. On top of this the Triamid field spells primarily <a data-name=""Triamid Cruiser"">Triamid Cruiser</a> can be played over and destroyed to either search for or summon <a data-name=""Triamid Sphinx"">Triamid Sphinx</a>. Sphinx helps enable OTKs that would be very hard to come by otherwise.  The strongest combo in the deck is using <a data-name=""Ties of the brethren"">Ties of the brethren</a> on either Serziel or on of the Level 4 rock earth monsters. This summons fantastic stun cards directly from the deck.  For <a data-name=""Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye"">Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye</a> summon <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abyss"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> and <a data-name=""Hand-Holding Genie"">Hand-Holding Genie</a> in defense position. <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Abyss"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> stops most decks from special summoning and <a data-name=""Hand-Holding Genie"">Hand-Holding Genie</a> gives all of your monster’s battle protection by forcing your opponent to only be able to attack a 2600 defense or more monster. For a level 4 rock earth monster summon <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a> and <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a>, However Koa’ki Meiru’s and <a data-name=""Triamid Master"">Triamid Master</a> provide other niche options. Fossil Dyna stops all special summoning and <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a> stops an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> from negating Fossil Dyna’s effect along with other good stun effects. Something worth mentioning is that the Triamid field spells boost attack and defense of rock type monsters, this helps make your stun monsters harder to kill by battle, which is one of their infamous weaknesses. I’ll also say that <a data-name=""Holding Arms"">Holding Arms</a> and <a data-name=""Holding Legs"">Holding Legs</a> are to interesting targets for Ties of the brethren that can be sided in depending on the match up.  <span><strong>What Weaknesses Does the Deck Have?</strong></span>  Consistency is probably the biggest weakness of the deck. Even with fantastic cards like <a data-name=""Magicians’ souls"">Magicians’ souls</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> its never going to be a perfectly consistent deck.  <span><strong>What to do Going Second?</strong></span>  This deck has some fun options going second. Not only do you have <a data-name=""Triamid sphinx"">Triamid sphinx</a> to help OTk’s, the deck easily can side in <a data-name=""Fossil Fusion"">Fossil Fusion</a> to summon the Fossil extra deck. <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> are obvious helps to going second. I suggest siding out Stun cards like <a data-name=""Gate Blocker"">Gate Blocker</a> and the barrier statues as well as <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>.  &nbsp;  Credit to: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/hoden/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/author/hoden/</a>  for giving me this idea"

You feeling lucky?,"This is my variant of the Cubic Deck, I really don't like the Summoner Monk version of this deck so I decided to make an OTK variant with a twist, instead of playing a version that takes advantage of new cards like Pot of Extravagance and Pot of Desires, I feel I kicked the luck of this deck up to an eleven as I ditched those cards for Cup Of Ace, it adds a bit of a twist because it leaves the outcome to a coin toss that I believe most players wouldn't say no to, this card is essentially a Pot of Greed with a  50% chance your opponent draws instead if you're lucky you might be able to go through an entire duel  without them  drawing at all and I like  the added  challenge it provides"
