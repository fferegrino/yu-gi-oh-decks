Twins give the deck some good solid grind game (and with Sunny a way to beat over monsters) whereas the Splights give the twins the generic negation and protection from hand traps that they are really lacking. I like this version a lot.  Added the Twins, it really does come up. The basic route is pretty simple, just Evil Twins things. The idea is to use Splights to set up Red + Djinn Buster + Trouble Sunny, and maybe a Carrot. However, when your Live Twin gets stopped, the Splights will also help set-up Ki-sikil or Lil-la plays, usually again back by negation. Red does a lot for the deck. Weirdly enough the deck doesn't rely that much on gigantic Splight. Honestly, I think the Splight Package is going to be very good for a very long time - even in a theoretical world where Gigantic is banned and every other maindeck card is limited, I think the package would still see play in Link or Rank 2 spam decks, and be very good."

The deck has a lot of room for tinkering around with cards that can specifically help go against a variety of different decks. This deck doesn't contain a lot of complex combos but I will go over simple lines you can go through with different resources in your hand, remember that as this is a control deck, the majority of your focus will be playing the game in a way that counters your opponent, so your combo lines may differ depending on the match-up, but the majority of cases will use the lines I lay out. I'll start out with the most basic <strong>Aleister the Invoker</strong> <em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. </em>This simple line will almost always guarantee you an Invoked Mechaba from just 1 copy of Aleister the Invoker. <strong>Aleister The Invoker + Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous </strong><em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. Activate Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous &gt; Special Summon Ecclesia &gt; Activate Effect To Add A Dogmatika &gt; Add Dogmatika Maximus. Dogmatika Maximus Effect Banishing Almiraj For Cost &gt; Special Summon Dogmatika Maximus &gt; Activate Dogmatika Maximus &gt; Send Titaniklad The Ash Dragon + El Shaddoll Apkallone To The GY &gt; Activate El Shaddoll Apkallone &gt; Add Shaddoll Schism.</em> This line is a really explosive set-up for the deck, netting you a Mechaba for negation, two Dogmatikas on field and a Shaddoll Schism with the material to make El Shaddoll Winda already in the GY. On top of this, the effect of Titaniklad will have an optional trigger on your end phase that will let you add a Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted to your hand for another negation tool on your opponent's turn. <strong>Aleister The Invoker + Nadir Servant </strong><em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. Activate Nadir Servant</em> <em>&gt; Send PSY-Framelord Omega &gt; Add Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous. </em>From this point you can just commit to the combo as explained above with Aleister the Invoker + Dogmatika Ecclesia, however keep in mind the PSY-Frame Omega you sent to the GY, you can activate its effect to put itself back into the Extra Deck and put Nadir Servant back into the deck to resent your resource usage. These are the standard lines to go through while playing this deck, however there are far more things you can do, as you have a bunch of options in your extra deck to almost act like a toolbox, like summoning Invoked Purgatrio to pick apart boards and help facilitate an OTK as it can also deal piercing battle damage. Invoked Raidjin and Invoked Augoeides are good summons off of Super Polymerization, Invoked Raidjin is good to make with something like your opponent's Baronne de Fleur or their Wind Barrier Statue if they're playing Floowandereeze. Invoked Augoeides is good in games against Branded Despia or in games where someone might be playing something like Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, Invoked Augoeides is also a decent monster to help push for an OTK. As always, play around with the deck, understand what the meta you will be playing in will look like and give and take accordingly, realistically I could have uploaded this deck with the engine specific cards but I just wanted to show off some tech choices you can consider for your build.</p>"

Your extra is pretty much a toolbox for remaining cards or going second.  You <strong>really </strong>want to see Uni-Zombie, Vampire Ghost, and Vampire's Domain in your opening hand. Vampire Ghost+most Vampire cards typically means you can end on Beatrice to send Necroworld Banshee and Doomking Balerdroch to the gy. The deck has a lot of unique interactions-Vampire Sucker+Ghost in the grave can be a quick effect 2 tribute on your opponents turn,  and Sucker draws you a card every time Doomking revives. Rivalry+Zombie World locks your opponent out of summoning."

Get Domitianus out and time be confident on what you negate. ,"With this toolbox deck If you can get at least Special summon one gladiator beast card you can usually find an out for most situations.  With that said the deck needs good resource management.  Equestes is your recycler he will get your comebacks back after use. Play Gladiator Rejection then combo Test tiger + any glad beast, Rescue Rabbit, Unexpected Dai to get the cards needed out. usually wiht Rejection i will bring out Bestiari (although this negates the automatic trigger of destroy spell on field) it will usually allow me to summon out Gyzarus the other big boss monster out on the field and clearing the board and tagging out after.  The ultimate goal is to get Domitianus out and to protect it with handtraps, his own effect and Gladiator Rejection.  Being able to end turn with Gladiator Beast comeback in hand in case they do break your board. However this usually happens AFTER the battle phase due the GBs getting their effects after combat.  On tag out idealy you set up your Domitianus but sometimes you need to use those SS for other situations the decision making will come with practice. But main combo is Attroxi send an Augustus to GY and SS Darius to then SS the Augustus you just sent from GY; OR just SS Augustus from deck and hopefully gain an effect from your hand.  Its a really fun Rogue deck and i have beaten countless metas with it. Been playing variances of Glad beasts for a long time and i really lov ehte deck."

This was submitted for the Novakin Membership Tournament.,"Main strategy is getting Stratos on the field either through Normal Summoning or getting him with Reinforcement, Emergency Call or A Hero Lives.  From there get Faris to the hand and throw another hero from the hand to activate the effect. Put Increase in the backrow with Faris effect. Tribute Faris for Increase's effect. Activate Increase to get Vyon who'll throw to the graveyard a hero.  From here we can go two places: - Ditch Shadow Mist if you want a card on your hand like Honest Neos - Ditch Malicious if you want to activate his effect or if you have thrown Denier there as Faris cost.  If Malicious and/or Denier are on the graveyard you want to go into Xtra Hero Crusader to get Malicious on the field for a free draw. After Malicious activate his effect to bring another one, activate Denier effect. When he hits the field choose the Banished malicious. This will allow for you to Link Malicious and Crusader into Dread Decimator and still activate Malicious effect once more to summon the one that was thrown back to the deck. With Denier and Malicious on the field you should be able to Poly to make DPE or some other hero. From here on out it's freestyle."

One thing is clear that it is the norm to not try to innovate what can be fixed; but sometimes, old norms need to be broken in order for new habits to be instated for the sake of progressing new ideas. That being said we have reached a point to where Pendulums have a chance to make a comeback in Yu-Gi-Oh's already tragic metagame. One full of chaos and disray; one full of cynicism and calamity; but also a metagame where it's not one deck or the other. Just as the ""supposed tier 0"" deck that feeds off the darkness by taking advantage of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, and it's fusion caliber to maximize the playing field with negates, disruptions, and all other annoyances; but only to be thwarted by all others by it's own tools.  &nbsp;  Now that the dust has settled and the dragon has been slained, the Pendulum Magicians can take it's course to do all it can to retake their place, even though they lost what was once their former power harnessed from a span of over 5 years. In contrast, the first of these pieces to make a comeback from their downfall of <a data-name=""Performapal Monkeyboard"">Performapal Monkeyboard</a>; however, the problem lies in it being at only 1 copy per a deck and given that I couldn't draw it out entirely or make proper use of it during my test runs, I recommend not playing it until it at least gets back at 2 or even back at unlimited status (considering that Plushfire will less likely ever come off the banlist at all). Arguably you can search Monekyboard out with <a data-name=""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker"">Performapal Skullcrobat Joker</a> and go from there; but I argue that he has better targets (such as <a data-name=""Double Iris Magician"">Double Iris Magician </a>and <a data-name=""Performapal Celestial Magician"">Performapal Celestial Magician</a>). Regardless, this is a card that has just got off the banlist and has already circulate its preferences from many other players who had different experiences and opinions with the card firsthand, so I will take it with the grain of salt instead.  &nbsp;  Next I made some slight changes to the lineup with the addition of the Symphonic Warrior package over Scythe Lock. The reason for this is the need for 0/0 Pendulum scales to make consistent Pendulum summons more frequent if I do not have <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a> at hand, or if I tend to need to him to go into <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>. Now in this case, I also made it clear it could also be a justification that I could take the opportunity to test the new Synchro monster <a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"">Symphonic Warrior Rockks</a>; as on summon he can recover a Pendulum Monster (such as Harmonizing Magician) from your Extra Deck to your hand, and can be placed in the Pendulum Zone if destroyed by battle/card effect. Also can retain the effect of the Pendulum monster recovery from the Extra deck (during the stand-by phase), but can pop itself and 1 monster that declares an attack during your opponents battle phase. It's a fun addition I wanted to do, not to give the cards any real attention or to inflate their sedimental value with hype through arrogance or over eagerness; but just an experiment I wanted to work with.  &nbsp;  Then comes the newly released link-2 monster, <a data-name=""Beyond the Pendulum"">Beyond the Pendulum</a> that allegedly was supposed to be a step up in replacing the former <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. What I do have a problem with here is that while it does a decent job in doing what Electrumite tries to do (which is generic searching for a pendulum monster); but it locks you out of monster effects of all kinds, unless you pendulum summon during the turn you summon this card. Which means that unless you wanna pass this off and just search for any Pendulum monster to prepare for Next turn plays, you aren't exactly gonna hesitate to rush in and play <a data-name=""Beyond the Pendulum"">Beyond the Pendulum</a> immediately into <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magician"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magician</a>s or into <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. To be fair though it does a good job on it's own if you play her right, and I give it the benefit of the doubt that I expect her to see play alongside <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> if he comes off the banlist in the future.  &nbsp;  Finally I wanna talk about the other stuff I have, regardless if I have or I haven't used them. First and foremost, there was a newly acquitted TCG exclusive Pendulum Fusion monster released in the most recent set know as <a data-name=""Patissciel Couverture"">Patissciel Couverture</a>, which can place itself in the Pendulum Zone if destroyed, and can place ANY other pendulum monster from the Extra Deck in the Pendulum Zone that is face up in the Extra Deck (made possible all thanks to the infamous fusion card, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>). Next comes another recent release from the same set known as <a data-name=""Psychic End Punisher"">Psychic End Punisher</a>, Which (at a cost of 1000LP) can banish up to 2 monsters on the field (1 from each side); can also be unaffected by your opponents activated effects if your LPs are lower than theirs; and can gain Attack points equal to the LP difference between both duelist during the battle phase.

Pacifis has two primary effects: <ol>  	<li>When a Normal Monster is summoned, search for a ""Phantasm Spiral"" card</li>  	<li>After the resolution of an opponent's card effect, Special Summon a lvl 8 Normal token to your field</li> </ol> Search the Phantasm Spiral trap cards to control the field and take victory. Phantasm Spiral equip cards help summon the 2900 Attk Phantasm Spiral Dragon to push for that extra bit of damage, and  Cardcar D gives draw power.  The Paleozoic trap cards not only assist in controlling the field, but also count as Normal monsters when Summoned from the graveyard, and thus can trigger Pacifis' effect to search for a Phantasm Spiral card.  Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi operates as a powerful omni-negate, and should your opponent destroy it, Summons a 4500 Attk Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon from the deck.  Sea Stealth Attack not only recycles and protects your field spell, but banishing your token as a response to opponent card effects guarantees a Pacifis search, and it also provides a destruction effect during battle for your lvl 8 token and Phantasm Spiral Dragon.  The Extra Deck should almost never be used, as it locks you out of the Phantasm Spiral card effects. Use only as a toolbox when absolutely necessary."

Also with some hands you don't want to search king for example if you have a revolving switchyard in your hand you would rather search derricrain or if you have detticain in your hand you would like to search for bullet. But continuing with the king line you would link off the river stormer for a goliath and activate the effect of trencher in your gy to bring back the brutal dozer you then link off dozer for goliath the link off both goliaths for an ancient gear ballista to search for an ancient gear bot which will then search for the infinitrack tunneller. Then you activate the tunneller tribute the ballista to summon itself then link off the tunneller for a goliath and use the gy effect of river stormer to tribute the goliath to summon itself(Don't use goliaths effect) then activate the effect if tunneller in gy to shuffle the brutal dozer, the three goliaths and the ancient gear ballista into the deck to draw two cards, that's the core combo the rest depends on your hand and what you draw the main thing is that your always looking for a way to summon number 81 with a derricrain attacked to it as effectively an unaffected zoodiac drident."

You can brick sometimes.  I wanted to keep this short so I left out many specific interactions between cards that you should look out for. I've been optimising and playing this deck since Master Duel was released.  &nbsp;  <strong>Goals:</strong> <strong>Dump as much of deck as possible into GY to activate effects and summon multiple negates.</strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>Step 1:</strong> Checking for and playing around hand traps:  Bait out hand traps with low value cards. <ul>  	<li>Use danger engine to bait out ash-blossom as their effect is not once per turn</li>  	<li>If you have Psy-Framegear Gamma in hand, try to bait out hand-trap into free Chaos Ruler</li>  	<li>Charge of Light Brigade discards cards even if the search is negated</li>  	<li>You have 10 cards which counter Maxx C</li>  	<li>Normal summon Raiden is good for checking for hand-traps</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Get out Chaos Ruler or Curious  Chaos Ruler is better summon, only Curious if you are unable to go into Chaos Ruler first.  I usually summon Curious with 3 different dark monsters  Curious can send: <ul>  	<li>Felis to the GY to set up for Borreload Savage Dragon (Most cases)</li>  	<li>Starliege Seyfert to get Levianeer from GY (if Felis cannot be sent to GY)</li>  	<li>Fairy Tail Snow for more material for Link Summons and disruption on opponents turn</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Summon Main Negates <ul>  	<li>Link Curious into Apollousa (usually for only 2 Monster Negates, the maximum 4 is overkill), so that there is a Link Monster in GY for Borreload Savage Dragon</li>  	<li>Summon Borreload Savage Dragon</li> </ul> If you still have extra resources: <ul>  	<li>Go into I:P Masquerena for Underworld Goddess and tribute opponents monster on their turn</li>  	<li>Go into Halqifibrax to summon Forumla Synchron and then Big red synchro dragon</li>  	<li>Go into Archlord Kristya if you are running that win-con</li> </ul> This is a basic end board that you want to achieve, however this deck has many different paths depending on draw and GY rng, you will have to play this deck for a long time to figure out all the possibilities.

Straightforward, consistent, efficient, and easy to use. ","The main gimmick of Blackwings is that when one comes out, more soon follow. This Deck runs like a well-oiled engine using Black Whirlwind to find exactly what you need, no heart of the cards necessary. Using a wide array of powerful 4 stars to put pressure on your opponent early and retrieve fellow Blackwings, mostly fetching tuners to synchro into stronger monsters with powerful effects. The most potent combo is using Auster the South Wind and Harmattan the Dust to get level 10 with only 2 Monsters. However, Dusty also pairs well with any 3 star tuner to get a Black-Winged Dragon. Black Wings also have access to good removal like Icarus Attack and Black Sonic. A playset of MST (including sideboard) and Delta Crow will also offer value against spell/trap heavy decks. The Deck is rounded out with some additional card advantage through Wing Requital and Allure of Darkness. Spells and Traps can be sideboarded out for more relevant cards like MST and Solemn Strike to counter Spell/Trap users or Book of Moon against aggro decks. That brings me to I think the most alluring aspect of this deck which is the huge surge of usable card advantage with multiple draw/fetch spells, Monsters that special summon for free and still plenty of room for customizable answers to any deck that you come across. On top of that, once you figure out which cards can be special summoned and which ones cannot, the deck plays straightforward as an aggressive beatdown deck and is very consistent with Black Whirlwind on the field. The balance between shutting down your opponents and playing to your strengths is a fine line but Blackwings soar along it gracefully."

This will push you to go down one of the paths. There is also a possibility of drawing both of the lvl5s (<em>Linkslayer</em> + <em>Red Hared Hasty Horse</em>) which would also facilitate Rank 5 plays.  <strong>Rank 1</strong> will end up with <em>Number F0: Utopic Future</em> with 6 materials (2x Lyrilusc XYZ each with 2 materials) and a <em>Linkuriboh</em>. I intend on either adding Utopic Draco Future or Downerd/Zeus to this build, as and when I can aquire them  <strong>Rank 5</strong> will end up with <em>Number 5: Doom Chimera Dragon</em>. Whilst not the best Rank 5 that can be made, it's the best that I have at my disposal at the moment. Adding <em>Overlay Regen</em> at a later date would allow for it to be boosted further  <strong>Link</strong> will end up where ever links end up. Being a low priority deck I haven't put much thought into it so I just have some casual annoyance, but ending up on the standard big bosses in <em>Accesscode Talker</em> or <em>Borrelsword</em> <em>Dragon</em> is possible with the correct build.  Overall, it is just a Kuriboh deck. The main deck can be tweaked for sure but I like that it pretty pure, without any of the standard staples or anything that take away from the uniqueness.

Is that too hard for you to grasp!?,"Hi guys!  So heroic got support in the new set, it’s an older archetype that, despite being interesting, is not that good.  But they just got five new cards, all of them pretty good in their own way.  Here’s my build for Heroics, in 2022.  Heroics are an earth warrior archetype using xyz monsters to get their job done. They recently got support to make an otk. I made an “ftk” list, it’s not really an ftk but it can win before your opponent does anything.  This list also has some nasty stuff it can do, particularly with the second engine I have, Bamboo.  The idea is that you can drop Excalibur, make it double, clavesolish then doubles it again, then the cursed bamboo sword lets it attack directly for game.  But if you go first there’s something different they can do, a turn skip.  Essentially the idea is to force your opponent to skip the main phases and make them pass, then swing for game, it’s pretty inconsistent but incredibly funny when it pulls off.  I will be writing up a full guide in the future for this variant of heroic."

This can be achieved most easily with Foolish Burial Goods or milling it with the effects of Agido and Kelbek. The main strategy will be to mill your opponent completely with Exchange in the graveyard, however, with a bit of luck it is possible to actually use the effect of Exchange and swap graveyards. You can get the card fairly easily in your hand with a number of tricks such as using Keldo's ability to put -any- card that mentions Exchange on your hand or using Kelbek to set it if it's already in your graveyard.</span>  <span>Using Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening will also easily get any of your mill cards into the graveyard. With Exchange in there with Agido, you can mill your opponent for 10 cards! If you have any mysterune cards in your starting hand, a great first move is to use them to get the field spell in your hand. Notice I only have one in my deck list. You really don't need more than one of it, or the continuous spell, Deceit of the Mysterune, as they're extremely easy to get out of the deck or graveyard with the extra deck monsters. Using the ability of Spring, you can mill your opponent with a few Mysterune cards, put them back in your deck and draw for more potential.</span>  <span>A big thing to remember with the Vernalizer fairies is that after you use them you are locked into Earth monster effects! Not a big deal, except if you want to throw out a Mysterune extra deck monster to get a field or continuous spell, you need to do that first before using the Vernalizer's. This is usually very easy to do and not a problem.</span>  <span>Blast Held By Fate is another card that while amazing, I might be willing to knock down in order to get the deck to 40 cards. It's a great surprise trap that can hit your opponent hard when set. It can be searched by Keldo or set from the graveyard by Kelbek and it can be banished from the graveyard to add a level 4 fairy monster back into your hand.</span>  <span>Gravekeeper's Trap is another must have in this deck. Once again, you really only need one as it's mostly searchable by either Keldo, set by Kelbek, or directly with Mudora (Who can also put cards back into your deck!) This card can not only keep your oppoant from activating affects in the graveyard and special summoning from it, but by discarding a card (Kelbek or Agido to mill on your opponents turn???) you can add -another- earth monster to your hand. More for milling back on your turn.</span>  <span>A key thing to keep in mind when building the Mysterune side of this deck is that Mysterune works best when it's about 1/3 of the deck. That's when you'll be seeing 2-3 of them consistently in your hand. Using them right away and getting Spring on the field is a great way to mill into your Vernalizer and Agido/Kelbek. I focused on Mysterune cards that I could be more guaranteed to use to matter going first or second. It gives me the best ability to get them into my graveyard right away. </span>  <span>Obviously you need to defend yourself and that's where this deck can get a little tricky. It's meant to mill an opponent completely within two turns. Gravekeeper and Blast By Fate can help, but the biggest and easiest defender to get out is Number 41: Bagooska The Terribly Tired Tapir. This card acts as your Book of Moon (And the main reason why this version doesn't have them in the main deck.)</span>  <span>Scareclaw Tri-Heart is a Book of Moon with more ATK, though he's much harder to pull out. In all of my test hands, I only bothered pulling him out once or twice.</span>  <span>And that's basically it! Mill as fast as possible! Cause chaos! There's a lot of potential in this deck. Not only are there dozens of cards I ended up pulling out (D.D Dynamite!) but there are other archetypes that could be potentially slipped in (Tearlaments!) Below is a list of a few of the cards that just didn't make the cut, but may return in a 60 card variant. </span>  <span>Mystic Mine: I desperately tried to keep this card in and will probably throw it back in for a 60 card version. It's a great defender, but I just couldn't get it consistently in my hand. </span>  <span>Set Rotation: Wasn't consistent, but it was great to have Spring and Mystic Mine up at the same time.</span>  <span>D.D. Dynamite: My first version of this deck had two of them. I desperately wanted to keep it in, but kept drawing it when I didn't want it and then never did when I did want it. I often milled my opponent faster than I could set and use this card.</span>  <span>Vernalizer Fairy of Flower and fields: I mostly kept this one in, because I love bunnies and have two rescues... but the other two work far better in the deck. I might slip this one back in to help get a few creatures on the field to get into Tired Tapir or Scareclaw.</span>  <span>Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms: It works, but with Forests and Awakening allowing you to throw a card in the graveyard to mill and Melting Snow allowing you to draw... there's no reason to have her in here.</span>  <span>Aussa The Earth Channeler: She's great, but Vernalizer does the job a little better.</span>  <span>Cataclysmic Crusted Calcifida; Great kind of hand trap and able to mill on your opponents turn by sending a card to the graveyard, but it often got in my hand when I didn't need it and was a little slow. Might go into the 60 card version.</span>  <span>Trap Trick: This was in my first version. Ended up bloating my mill hands.</span>  <span>Book of Moon: Not needed when you have that very Tired Tapir.</span>  <span>Toll Hike: Great card to add in theory, but it never showed up in any test plays.</span>  <span>World Soul - Carbon: Great card, but Vernalizer does the job better and faster.</span>  <span>Zolga The Prophet: This was in my first build to interact with the last effect of Gravekeeper's Trap. This card allows you to look at the top five cards of your opponents deck. With Gravekeeper's Trap, if you call what they draw correctly, they discard a card. It's a great idea in theory, but you often won't have these on the field together so I ended up tossing this one.</span>  <span>Demise of the Land: Was meant to work with Mystic Mine. Ended up bloating my hand (I was running it at 3). Swapped it out for Pot of Extravagance. </span>  <span>I spent far longer than I care to admit working on this deck and am more than excited to see them come to the States. Let me know what you think and what ideas you have for this deck.</span>"

Because BAR can search for Scattershot from the grave, the deck uses Foolish Burial Goods and Volcanic Rocket to fetch it from the deck first, and either Magic Planter or Volcanic Doomfire can send it from the field to the grave with great effect (assuming your opponent doesn't destroy it) Other powerful traps are run to help force your opponent to mistakenly send it, and can be changed to suit the matchup (I run Mistake because my usual opponent mains Blackwings). Laval and Flamvell cards provide the rest of the heavy hitters and burn with potential for syncho summoning bigger cards and/or useful utility like Black Rose Dragon. Synchoing is made even easier with Rekindling, and you can always fill your grave using discard effects like Laval Canonneer and Lightning vortex, aside from just setting to chump block. The deck is good for casual games, and works best against monster-heavy decks. It isn't very efficient or consistent, but it does have explosive potential for nuking your opponent's monsters while chunking away at their LP, just as pyro cards should."

This deck is a control deck, but unlike normal paleo, it has a way to summon level 8 synchro monsters using Graydle Slime Jr. You do this by summoning on to the field through one of several means, and building an endboard of halq and Toad. With this you can go into locust and a level 2 on the opponent's turn. Other than that it is a fun trap control deck using the paleo cards and other good generics like D Barrier and solemn strike. Going second the plan is to side into raigeki and dark hole in order to clear the field and set up your control board."

Generaiders to stop some plays on your opponents turn.,"A fun deck idea that I thought of when I was creating a heroic deck. Weirdly enough it actually got me a few wins at my locals. While I did lose more than I won matches, this deck managed to make certain meta decks struggle just to defeat me. I wanted to share this deck to show that there are options to make heroics fun and somewhat competitive.  So there are 2 engines and a couple of support cards  1. Heroics: There are two points to the heroics. One is to get as many heroics on the field to go into your xyz monsters. Two is hitting your opponent with massive damage or as one yugituber said ""Hit em in the Jaw.""  2. Generaider: This engine is more effective on your opponent's turn as long as you have the field spell out. You just bring out one generaider monster and spam the field with tokens, making your opponent deal with a lot of monsters.  3. Support cards like Isolde help your heroics since they are warriors and Immortal Phoenix Gearfried utilizes the equip spells you send to grave due to Isolde's effect.  &nbsp;"

Not only that but scareclaw astra gives additional attacks to scareclaw monsters in the EMZ to help with OTKing. So we run an absolutely insane going second package with 9 board wipes, and 6 kaijus. If things go our way game 1, in game 2 the opponent will surely make up go first, so we side in all 15 cards and use the dangers to go into our rank 8 package with negates like hope harbinger and photon lord, and try to make apollousa as well. Our deck makes use of several different monster types so TCBOO while it does hurt us a bit, most likely will hurt the opponent more."

The deck actually has everything to suit me. It's a Fiend deck. It can run the Accesscode OTK thanks to also technically being a Cyberse deck. It actually really loves Unchained Abomination, and can make use of most of the best generic links. It can run a lot of interactive cards. And it is a dumb control deck where you set 5 and pass. Also, it has grind game. I really appreciate decks that can do a little bit of everything, and while the archetype is a little weak to Nibiru, it survives other hand traps admirably, and what the engine lacks in negation you can make up for with how many interrupts you can run.  New day, new list, new me. This version cut Desires to run cards I had cut on the basis of wanting to run Desires - this should enable Accesscode OTKS more often with Parallel Exceed, and I:P more often with the defensive Gamma, as well as shoring up the deck's play going second against FTKs or otherwise incredible combo decks. The main cuts were the extra Frost, 2 Desires, and some of the board breaking cards, as well as Knightmare Phoenix in the extra deck, because honestly, I never summoned that card, and we need Almiraj for Parallel Exceed plays. The list is otherwise the same - it has cut the draw power down (although the engine itself does that admirably) but in it's place it has stronger offensive and defensive tools."
