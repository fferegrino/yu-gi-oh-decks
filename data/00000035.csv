Choose the outcome of&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to skip your opponent's turn at the cost of two of your monsters being delivered to GY. Don't send Arcana and Chaos by accident and make sure you have two monsters available, which can be arranged with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>3) Set all of ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" and one of ""Primal Seed"" cards. End your turn but not before changing ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch+Hold"" and setting to ""ON"" in-game to not miss any action, which can be edited in ""Duel"" section of settings page.</p><p>4) It's your turn now. Activate all of ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" trap cards.</p><p>5) Now, here is infinite burn. Revive a Machine monster (e.g: Martial) with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroy it with ""Offerings to the Doomed"". Rinse and repeat for constant 300 x 3 = 900 damage in total until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Arcana"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

The United States, known for its global influence, made a serious mistake in underestimating the power of the enemy. After intense conflict, China has emerged as a formidable force, imbued with impressive military might. However, amid this turmoil, an unexpected partnership began to play a significant role in the war: Brazil.</p><p>Quietly, Brazil, driven by a sense of justice and solidarity, decided to help China in its battle against the European powers. Help arrived in a variety of ways, from the full of economic resources to the leak of American information to the Chinese on Brazilian soil.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the United States, authorities frantically debated where this crucial aid to the enemy came from. Military analysts, with their sharp minds, combed through countless intelligence reports, trying to figure out where these essential resources for China came from. However, the secret of Brazil and China was well guarded, unable to be unraveled.</p><p>Amidst this geopolitical strife, a new voice has begun to emerge: that of America's youth. Tired of seeing their country's youth sent to the battlefield, they refused to join the war. A large demonstration was raised among the American population who did not want to have their children killed in the war, a wave of protests across the country.</p><p>This insurrection, however, was not enough to change the course of the war. Hostilities continued, and as the months passed, the United States found itself increasingly weak. China, in collaboration with Russia, Brazil and South Africa, formed a powerful and efficient alliance, leaving the Americans with no way out.</p><p>In the end, the defeat of the United States was decisive. The military power of the United Nations against the country was overwhelming and, gradually, its lines of defense were being broken. China has emerged as a big winner, sealing its position as a world superpower alongside its powerful allies Brazil, Russia and South Africa.</p>"

With Kite, I actually have a lot to work with, as he was seen using many cards from Photon Shockwave in his introductory duel, along with a few older cards. (Though it's strange that he was using Goddess with the Third Eye as a filler. Even when he got a Fusion monster later that season, fusion substitutes don't work for it.)</p><p>As part of the exercise, I'm assuming Kite was one of the first people to get cards from the Photon Shockwave set (even aside from the Photon monsters which would not have been distributed to the public in that world). It's a privilege of working for the people designing and printing the cards in his world. But anything past that wasn't even on the drawing board when he was initially fielded. That said, if there's anything that can be done to refine the deck within these restrictions, feel free to make suggestions.</p>"

This version banks on the fact it can easily go first (setting up Fossil Dyna and Secret Village) whilst maintaining the powerful plays it has going second. I had a lot of fun with Vaylantz and its definitely a great deck to keep around. It will probably never be meta, but is occasionally topping some events, especially in the OCG.</p><p>Have fun!</p><p>The decklist belonging to the videos about the floodgate version of Vaylantz. In the side deck you'll find cards that I want to add, but just wasn't able to craft just yet. Thus the deck can be made slightly better.&nbsp;</p><p>P.s. if you have questions, watch the Vaylantz videos on my channel or post a comment under one of the videos. Thx!</p>"

You have four alternatives:</p><ul><li>Special Summon one of them with Ancient to deliver as Synchro material for Librarian.</li><li>Discard one of them with Dugares.</li><li>Discard both of them with Ravenous.</li><li>Special Summon one of them with Saryuja and destroy it with either ""Acid Rain"" or ""Thunder Crash"".</li></ul><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Scale and destroy all of your monsters with ""Thunder Crash""...</p><ul><li>Alternatively, ""Dark Hole"" works as well, seen in ""Side Deck"" but it costs SR to craft and you wouldn't want your opponent's side to be disturbed to trigger GY related effects. ""Thunder Crash"" is N to craft btw.</li></ul><p>3) Special Summon ""Chaos Emperor Dragon"". From here on, cycle your combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"". As long as you target Primal Seeds each other, it won't be an issue.</p><p>4) With this setup, your Main Monster Zone should have four free spots. Fill two of them by reviving both Coltwings with ""Monster Reborn"". When you revive last one, you will fill last remaining spots with two tokens.</p><p>5) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 10</li><li>New calculation = Token (10) + Token (10) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (24)</li></ul><p>6) Repeat the step explained in #5, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>7) When you think it's enough, play ""Acid Rain"" to clear up all Machines. Note that Coltwings won't be destroyed at first because tokens actually protect them. If you play for another time, Coltwings will be erased for certain.</p><p>8) It's time to bring forth ""Dark Strike Fighter"" but in order to do so, we need to Synchro Summon it. Just revive Stardust + Tuner with ""Monster Reborn"" to Synchro Summon ""Dark Strike Fighter"" later on.</p><p>9) Due to tokens being destroyed, level of Coltwings has been reset. Yet, remember Chaos Emperor Dragon? Play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" for one last time on Chaos and then, either tribute Chaos or Coltwing with Dark Strike to deal a big damage. It's like a nuclear bomb launched right into your opponent's face, don't you think?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Draw an arc of light across the heavens! Pendulum Summon! Appear now, my monsters!","<p style=""text-align: left;"">Due to the nature of how volitile Pendulum can be in Trinity (especially when playing around specific Effect Monsters), this is one variant of many that can be applied when taking into consideration Pendulum Magician. This build in particular aims to make the most usage of Rank 4s and Synchro 8s while also featuring a few bombs here and there that still synergize without clogging up the hand too much with non-scales. Unfortunately, losing Halqifibrax was an indirect nerf to PendMa's ability to have pressure during the opponent's turn, but it's still playable.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">If you're interested in a more tempo-focused build, I'll be uploading one sometime in the future; however, I will say that Metalfoes tend to favor that style of play better as their room for mistakes and punishment is much more forgiving thanks to the abundance of searchers, Fusion Summoning, and Normal Monsters.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>- Difficulty -</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><br /><em>If you're going to be playing Pendulum in Trinity you should at least be forewarned that your hands will differ vastly in quality and consistency, especially the bigger your deck size is. No two openers should ever realistically be expected to be identical unless they're bridging through Extra Deck lines or engines and even then, your Pendulum composition would vary regardless of how consistent that board may've been (i.e. Bagooska/Halqi pass). You'll have to be prepared to weigh the worth of monster effects vs. necessary scales in tandem with determining if it's even worth it to commit to certain plays when faced with backrow or the dreaded Maxx ""C"" and Twin Twisters. Lastly, you'll also be committing Xyz materials to the GY instead of the Face-Up Extra Deck like one might be used to, so be prepared for that as well as non-archetypal cards sent there are functionally lost for the remainder of the duel without Omega.</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>Since our plays focus primarily on the Extra Deck and not long-winded combos like its TCG counterpart, we just need to find any two level 4s to get off to the races... or establish a Synchro play that caters to the hand's follow-up options. Finding Pendulum Call is by-far the most consistent you'll probably get to an opener though, on top of protecting your scales from counterplay. Loop it with Enlightenment Paladin to further cycle your names faster.</em><br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>- Sackiness - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong><br /></strong><em>Not many avenues for sacking here since your best topdecks are situational or rely on a discard to work (like Pendulum Call). The addition of Revolution Synchron allows us to Black Rose the board without having to worry about conditional play like Exciton would require of us (and is also just unlimited for some reason). Berserker allows us to steal games pretty quickly with its raw damage output. And Clear Wing just enables Raigekis when appropriate... actually... between Berserker, Paladin, Archfiend, Magma, and Rebellion, the deck just features a myriad of conversions to finish off remaining LP from alarming levels that may've seemed safe prior.<br /><br /></em><strong>- Viability - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>Viable enough. Like any actually dedicated Pendulum deck, I would <strong>not</strong> recommend playing it blindly into a tournament without practice first. You need to be able to play through your scales getting destroyed and targeted constantly, on top of the usual suspects for disruption and interaction. You cannot expect to rely heavily on Pend Summoning in every situation and need to be able to read the situation and assess which moves give the highest payout for the amount of risk you're putting in... and most importantly... you need to be able to cope with hands that feature no low/high scales.... everysinglegoddamtime.</em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p><hr /><p>No longer write-up concerning strategy here. PendMa itself doesn't really have anything outside of loops with Timestar, Oaf, and Star so if that's what you're looking for you're better off relying on incorporating engines like Exosister, Performages w/ Omega loops, or just simply sacking the opponent into oblivion with Mega Kuraz + Albaz shenanigans.</p><hr /><p><strong>45 Card Deck = 3 Points with 3p used.</strong><br />1p Duelist Alliance (Extra Copy)<br />1p Witchcrafter Golem Aruru <br />.5p Pendulum Call<br />.5p Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</p><p>Learning Pendulum in Trinity takes some time and getting used to. Prepare to suffer some loses or call otherwise good hands clunky on first look-throughs. If you're having trouble getting used to them I strongly encourage you to check out some replays of them in action, most notably the replays concerning victories that aren't just granted to them by a single turn's OTK. You can also always review your own replays to see what you could've done differently as the nature of Pendulums in a limited format like this invite room for a myriad of different routes to be taken with hands and decisions concerning them. Most cards tend to be starters, bridges, or extenders so having to sacrifice them to the S/T for scales makes decision-making a lot less braindead than something like ""NS Girsu"" into your respective pivots. <br /><br />Good luck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It has been a while since I brought up means of immortality with <strong><a href=""/deck/335454"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Final Countdown</a>,</strong> now I have formed another. Let me explain the plan, which is not that complex but you need to act fast!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGTRTy4fXrE"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>(Final Countdown vs Kashtira)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Play ""Double Summon"" and ""Final Countdown"". The effect of ""Double Summon"" will be used for Necroface to not deck out since we will draw a lot of cards.</p><p>2) Send 2 x Coltwing + 1 x Generator to GY. Here are the methods...</p><ul><li>Dugares/Ravenous to send from hand to GY.</li><li>Ancient to pull off from hand and deliver to GY as Synchro material for Librarian.</li><li>Saryuja to pull off from hand and deliver to GY with either ""Thunder Crash"" or ""Acid Rain"".</li></ul><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Scale and destroy all of your monsters with ""Thunder Crash""...</p><ul><li>Alternatively, ""Dark Hole"" works as well, seen in ""Side Deck"" but it costs SR to craft and you wouldn't want your opponent's side to be disturbed to trigger GY related effects. ""Thunder Crash"" is N to craft btw.</li></ul><p>4) Special Summon ""Chaos Emperor Dragon"". From here on, cycle your combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"". As long as you target Primal Seeds each other, it won't be an issue.</p><p>5) With this setup, your Main Monster Zone should have four free spots. Fill two of them by reviving both Coltwings with ""Monster Reborn"". When you revive last one, you will fill last remaining spots with two tokens.</p><p>6) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 10</li><li>New calculation = Token (10) + Token (10) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (24)</li></ul><p>7) Repeat the step explained in #6, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>8) When you think it's enough, play ""Acid Rain"" to clear up all Machines. Note that Coltwings won't be destroyed at first because tokens actually protect them. If you play for another time, Coltwings will be erased for certain.</p><p>9) Time to become immortal. Remember Chaos Emperor Dragon? Due to destruction of tokens, level of Coltwings will reset but modified level of Chaos still remains. Take advantage of it by reviving ""Healing Wave Generator"" with ""Monster Reborn"" and targeting ""Chaos Emperor Dragon"" to gain millions of LP...</p><ul><li>You can repeat this setup as many times as you please by destroying Generator with ""Acid Rain"" and reviving with ""Monster Reborn"".</li></ul><p>10) If you still have time, first and foremost, play Necroface. With spells banished thanks to Panda, you can reshuffle nearly a third of your Main Deck. Then, play ""Pot of Avarice"" a bunch of times to pile up your Main Deck with monsters as well...</p><ul><li>Ideally, you should play ""Pot of Avarice"" step at first and when you are done, you can set all three later on to fight against Mill decks. However, if you are running out of time, play Necroface first, since it's a one card play to shuffle about 20 cards.</li><li>If you don't like the setup with ""Pot of Avarice"", or want an easy shuffler like Necroface, Exodius got you covered. Check it in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul><p>11) You can end your turn now. Stalling for 20 turns shouldn't be an issue thanks to infinite amount of LP but be mindful Mill based decks. Whenever possible, shuffle cards with ""Pot of Avarice"" and ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" to not deck out at all costs.</p><p>12) Congratulations, you win the duel with Final Countdown!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Final Countdown"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Let's see...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0h4zOie-gHQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gam</strong><strong>eplan</strong></p><p>1) If you go first, plant a flower to the opposing side with ""Black Garden"". One is enough and you can destroy Garden with Ancient/Ravenous, up to you. If you go second and your opponent has at least a monster, disregard this step.</p><p>2) Send 2 x Coltwing + 1 x Demetto to GY. Here are the methods...</p><ul><li>Dugares/Ravenous to send from hand to GY.</li><li>Ancient to pull off from hand and deliver to GY as Synchro materials. Coltwing is preferred for Librarian.</li><li>Saryuja to pull off from hand and deliver to GY with either ""Thunder Crash"" or ""Acid Rain"".</li></ul><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA + Xiangsheng on Pendulum Scales and destroy all of your monsters with ""Thunder Crash"".</p><p>4) Special Summon ""Chaos Emperor Dragon"". From here on, cycle your combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"". As long as you target Primal Seeds each other, it won't be an issue.</p><p>5) With this setup, your Main Monster Zone should have four free spots. Fill two of them by reviving both Coltwings with ""Monster Reborn"". When you revive last one, you will fill last remaining spots with two tokens.</p><p>6) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 10</li><li>New calculation = Token (10) + Token (10) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (24)</li></ul><p>7) Repeat the step explained in #6, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>8) When you think it's enough, play ""Acid Rain"" to clear up all Machines. Note that Coltwings won't be destroyed at first because tokens actually protect them. If you play for another time, Coltwings will be erased for certain.</p><p>9) By destroying everything but Chaos, you will have a high level monster. After reviving Demetto with ""Monster Reborn"", you have two options to XYZ Summon Number 63...</p><ul><li>If you have two Level 1 monsters in your hand, Pendulum Summon these and form up Number 63.</li><li>If you don't have two Level 1 monsters in your hand, revive two Level 1 monsters in your GY with ""Monster Reborn"" and form up Number 63.</li></ul><p>10) You have Number 63 and high level Chaos. Activate Xiangsheng to raise the rank of Number 63 up to the level of Chaos by targeting both.</p><p>11) Activate Number 63 by sending a Level 1 monster, which is also a Normal Monster. By fulfilling the conditions of Demetto, you can target the plant to destroy and select Number 63 to deal a big chunk of damage to your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Branded isn't really at the top of the meta as well, but they also were severely nerfed due to the limit of their best card, Branded Fusion - thus weakening another deck that does well with boardbreakers. The meta decks that are in the vacuum that Tearlaments/Branded leave behind are Spright and Runick, and decks like that crack wide open under the relentless assault of boardbreaking cards and the Sky Striker engine!&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">Basically what I'm saying is that boardbreakers right now in Masterduel are STRONG!</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">This is where Sky Strikers come in - in addition to having enough main deck space to fit in the mandatory ""Maxx C"" package (9 cards), the strategy can also comfortably fit powerspells like Lightning Storm, Dark Ruler No More, Raigeki and Triple Tactics Talent! The Sky Striker engine also has cards that excel at cracking boards like Widow Anchor and Afterburners.&nbsp;<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />The time-tested strategy with blind second Sky Strikers is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's grind game. This is done by setting up multi-role and if you cannot, you prioritize getting Engage! from deck and using it as much as possible especially with it's extra +1 draw.</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">This deck has cards specifically picked out for the September 2023 meta, like Triple Tactics Talent (super good since everyone uses Spright, Tear, and handtraps, etc).<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />The current meta allows for Lightning Storm and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they generally spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards. For example, you can bait out your opponent's singular S/T negate (Like Spright Carrot/Baronne) with Afterburners then obliterate everything afterwards with Raigeki! If that's not enough, Raye and friends can clear the board very well during the battle phase and with Zeke's banish.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet due to the sheer resource advantage and offensive pressure this deck generates, you can clear the board with a plethora of cards including Linkage, allowing Raye to OTK all by herself!<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Arcana+Sentence of Doom+Trap Reclamation,"<p>Hi there! It has been a while since I played <a href=""/deck/destiny-of-panda-334834"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Destiny Board</strong></a> deck. I decided to revisit my old deck and put a new twist. Take as many turns as you like and win the game with Destiny Board. Let me show you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/BfDCPCH.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>After placing ""Light Barrier"", Arcana was Special Summoned by Saryuja. After choosing the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong>, you can send two of your monsters to GY and take an extra turn. Make sure your side of battlefield is full of monsters but it's alright to miss one or two.</li><li>""Into the Void"" was played. Therefore, Sabres + Balerdroch will be delivered to GY, which is what we want. Reason is that you can Special Summon both from GY to your side and use both to take as many turns as you need.</li><li>All traps were set and all of letters will be delivered to GY, which is fine. ""Sentence of Doom"" can find three letters and ""Trap Reclamation"" can allow you to repeat ""Sentence of Doom"" one more time to find last letter.</li><li>Don't change button to anything other than ""Auto"". Never set to ""OFF"". ""ON"" can ask meaningless confirmations, so ""Auto"" should be fine from now on.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) It's your turn now, if you have used the ability of Arcana. When you are in Standby Phase, activate your first trap, which is ""Destiny Board"". Then, chain into ""Sentence of Doom"" (SoD) but don't use its effect yet when asked to. Start putting letters when you are in Main Phase 1, which is when you should activate SoD. Next, you should chain into ""Trap Reclamation"" to retrieve SoD after you have put a letter. Although I forgot doing it, I did ""Sentence of Doom &gt;&gt;&gt; Trap Reclamation"" chain on next turn, not a big deal:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/zuGVJoK.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>In case you wonder, Sabres was Special Summoned by shuffling a card you have on top of your deck. Balerdroch has arrived during your Standby Phase, thanks to a field spell present on the battlefield.</li><li>While using the ability of SoD, there is an option related to Fiend monsters. Since Sabres is a Fiend monster, this option will always appear to you until he arrives on the battlefield. Just don't pick up this option by accident or you will miss your chance of putting a letter. Reason is that you can only use one effect per turn and only once that turn. What a harsh condition, this is the example of ""hard once per turn"" effect.</li><li>As always, don't forget to send Sabres + Balerdroch to GY for extra turn with Arcana.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Let's make up for the mistake I did in #2. I forgot ""Sentence of Doom &gt;&gt;&gt; Trap Reclamation"" chain, but this time, I did. Have a look at pictures for better understanding:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/aBPzvcm.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/1RkXm0M.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/B7QRlbR.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/fLVqAMt.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/UlXbpbB.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) For your next two turns, place Sabres + Balerdroch from GY to battlefield. On your Main Phase 1, place your letters with SoD. Then, send Sabres + Balerdroch to GY for extra turn thanks to Arcana, both of which will come back to life anyways. With all five letters present on your board, you win the duel:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/iWHqL8Y.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/yknCzbo.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/oLSlnEV.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch it in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/JZMAFIG64A8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your fate has brought you here to save up SR and UR points. Let's have a look:</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" + ""Into The Void"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Doomking Balerdroch"" can be found within ""Abyssal Underworld"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Destiny Board"" can be found within ""The Trap in the Wicked Castle"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

But in 2023, it can be a little difficult. Monsters nowadays have so many abilities, and many of them can't be targeted or destroyed by card effects, which are problematic because your main form of removal is by targeting and destroying things with Thunder Dragon Titan. So the remaining spell/traps are here to specifically allow us to achieve our endgame goal of board breaking and destroying everything.</p><p><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=54693926"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/54693926.jpg"" data-card=""54693926"" data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</span></a> is a card I've fallen in love with!

It also helps us deal with gigantic monsters that Thunder Dragon Titan can't beat over in battle. Which can be annoying. I also just really really like Book of Moon for it's utility and disruption.

You don't need Raigeki, but it has some useful moments. Raigeki is good when your opponent has a whole bunch of backrow.

Great for closing out games and good for banishing Thunders. I only recommend it because CED is an R on Master Duel, so it is much easier to obtain compared to Levianeer or Armageddon</p><hr /><p><strong>GAMEPLAN</strong></p><p>Going First or Second usually doesn't matter for Thunder Dragons. Both options are equally good for this deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Going First allows you to summon Colossus and Titan and then belligerently disrupt your opponent, denying them the chance to break your board.</p><p>Going Second allows you to break through just about any board.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I prefer going first, as I think it's better to have Colossus and Titan in play and put constant pressure on the opponent, never giving them any breathing room and denying every attempt they make to stop you.</p><p><em><strong>Overall:<br /><br /></strong></em>Thunder Dragons are an AMAZING deck that shouldn't be underestimated. Titan is not only a gigantic 3200atk monster, but it also has a spammable destruction effect. Colossus also puts in so much work, locking your opponent out of searching their deck can win games all on its own.</p><p>I highly encourage you to give this deck a try!

The deck's main strategy is to use Iblee to lock your opponent while still having an endboard with plenty of negates and interaction if your opponents has the out to the lock. This variant of the deck loses to Droll, so I found myself frequently using Prosperity to dig for the Called by the Grave. If the opponent doesn't Droll me there, then it's great to use as insurance for resolving Gigantic. Foolish Burial is also an amazing card in this build; it gave me access to Water Enchantress or Angler, depending on what I needed. Fateful is great for getting Angler out of your hand as well, as you can use it to send to grave upon resolution of searching the Gryphon Rider. I used Dogoran as my Kaiju of choice, because I was able to use Ninja Shadow Mosquito to put a counter on it and burn my opponent for game due to the high attack on it. However, it was still low enough for me to beat over it with Gigantic, if the Mosquito win-con was so longer an option.<br /><br />I dropped my first two rounds to Unchained/Vanquish Soul and Purrely after losing both die-rolls and shaking some nerves off, as this was my first regional event ever. I won the next 7 rounds straight against Branded/Chimera, Purrely (2x), Plunder Patroll, Kashtira, Rikka/Sunavalon and Infernoble to make the Top 32 cut and receive a national invite.</p>"

As much as I like going second, there's a variety of decks that use the same tools but set up better locks or end the game more consistently. Also Yata is a bad card. So with a deck that can run as many consistency tools as spirits, I thought to just run as much as possible. Nikitama is an upstart in most hands, Crane is the only good wind Spirit, and their all level 4 which enables a dugaress play. Dogmatika is half a ritual plus an upstart. This normally somewhere between 2-4 draws per turn, which helps a lot.<br /><br />Normally, the field spell plus a nothing spirit is 2/3rds of the set up. You just need to be able to grab a singular piece of the combo. Aratama plus the field spell is full combo. Use the field spell to summon the L4 Baron, use its effect to either grab Aratama or the L4 Baroness and Calling(Then use the Aratama to seach said Baroness.) Use Calling to summon the Baroness, then search power spot. In the end phase, the baroness returns to hand triggering both Power Spot and Himigori. Himigori set Stars Align, and power spot search whichever piece of the combo, either the ritual spell or big monster. Unfortunatly, if you don't have both, this set-up is dead. Also, you need to have one of the big monsters in deck as well in order to get Stars align in grave, which is why we run 3 of the big rituals.<br /><br />This means you can either bounce 3 monsters or Shuffle 3 backrow and sometimes set up an Amano lock. My big issue with running more Amano is that unfortuntlely it is a kind of brick in hand. I keep messing around with its ratio's and its&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>best at 2, but I wanted to run some other funny cards so...<br /><br />The Dogmatika package is fairly self-explantory with it being generic consitency and sending Herald of Arc Light, with the @ignister being there as a 3rd target to send of Nadir/Maximus turn 1, other extra deck bulk is avaliable. So are Ash and Book of Moon. The execption to this decks goal, because I think the card is funny (and the only non-shino WIND Ritual which does anything) is [<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Raging Storm Dragon - Beaufort IX,] part of what appears to be the 'what can we put on a battle handtrap and make it still god awful' competition which Konami sometimes makes an addition to. Its only summonable by Himigori (The named ritual spell on it is god-awful, requiring exact levels) This ones random benefit to the deck is that it is a) a ritual you can summon first turn&nbsp;<em>sometimes&nbsp;</em>which is an interuption <em><strong>and&nbsp;</strong></em>is a wind monster which triggers both Power Spot and Himigori. Then it also can blank a big monster's attack which is nice.<br /></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Overall the deck is exactly one good WIND spirit monster away from being super consitent, but for now, its just a fairly consistent rogue deck that sets up a floodgate. But also runs spirits, which makes it infinitely funnier.</span></p>"

Frankly, I think this current iteration isn't too much off of one of my favorite builds but even with that said it's more than a little susceptible to being adjusted by the banlist on a whim due to the nature of it. Nonetheless, I've decided to stop dallying and just submit a proper build as the tempo/midrange BEWD variant that isn't actively looping and spamming Chaos Creator to no end just isn't really taking advantage of what BEWD has to offer. It's more of just a typical Chaos deck held back by Blue-Eyes cards. This? This is pushing all of the support we've received to its absolute limit and it feeeeels sooooo gooood!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>- Difficulty -</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>You don't need a PhD to pilot this strategy and its honestly pretty on-brand given how BEWD plays in standard TCG. Most combos are pretty limited in their top end (which is odd to say given that we make use of a vanilla as our main monster here) but you can generally follow either a flowchart or recognize certain setups and easily reference/access virtually the same lines of play each and every match. Consistency is king in Trinity (outside of just spamming backrow) so reliable, repeatable lines just as a baseline helps make the deck easy to pilot and approach regardless of prior experience with the archetype.</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>The deck's lines are repeatable no matter the gamestate nor match nor opponent most of the time and the build is primarily focused around seeing specific openers or hand states rather than just typical combinations of good stuff cards in addition to the occasional BEWD summon. That said, the places that give you the most payoff can be countered somewhat critically in places such as White Stone of Ancient's EP effect, Abyss' respective effects, and any hand unlucky enough to just be downright unplayable due to a combination of high level monsters or a similar dilemma. This is one of the downsides of favoring the BEWD support over just a typical midrange/OTK Chaos deck.</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>- Sackiness - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong><br /></strong><em>Probably on brand for Seto but regardless, topdecking Dragon Shrine, any revival, Cataclysm, the Chaos Engine, Galactikuriboh, etc. just represents so many levels of sacky nonsense that it can just result in games decided without even fully representing the many strategies available in this build. As such you can save those plays for later on in the match as trumps and there's not much the opponent can really do about it without foresight.<br /><br /></em><strong>- Viability - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>Chaos seems ridiculously powerful right now with the current iteration of the banlist. Blue-Eyes unfortunately isn't the best way to play Chaos; however, the best way to play BEWD is definitely reliant on Chaos. As such, BEWD is pretty viable to play in bracket and isn't much of a slouch despite being an anime archetype as remember: this is Trinity. Resources are pretty limited and one of the biggest things BEWD has going for it is in-fact the big number. Outting the first two or so 3k beatsticks may be trivial for your opponent but even just sticking one for longer than one turn or repeatedly representing 9k+ LP damage becomes exhausting to out since outting things with a clean +1 through battle is not really an option unless said opponent is running something like Moon Mirror Shield (lol). Your monsters being tutored out is consistent, your opponent having necessary outs is not. Play to your advantage and you should definitely be rewarded for it.</em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Pros:</strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Your unga bunga uninterrupted combo lines are really potent and can pivot depending on the match-up/turn you're playing at. While BEWD historically could be an OTK deck, your turn 1 plays are arguably significantly stronger with far less in the way of counterplay. Curious as to why? Check out the combo section below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Monster Stealing</strong>: One of the absolutely most powerful removal effects in Trinity and it's hard not to see why. You convert all resources poured into bringing out a monster (that even cost summons on that respective turn from your opponent) into yours immediately. We do this reliably with Cipher Dragon and depending on the circumstances concerning that summon, we can convert that steal into a way of protecting our monsters. It's a little absurd honestly.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Tempo Tricks</strong>: I normally wouldn't play as many tricks as I feature in this build; however, since it is a 55 card deck and isn't reliant on slot machine mill tactics, it's better to be sure that you have some forms of interaction for when your opponent does have their own, especially with regards to games 2 and 3. Our interaction is the most potent in our S/Ts; however, we do possess ones that can make our lower level and weaker monsters significantly more annoying to deal with thanks to the Kuriboh and Honest being in the main deck.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Big Number Big Damage</strong>: You should constantly be representing one or two-turn lethal setups. Even in the event that you aren't, if a level 8 monster sticks with no restrictions, your entire Extra Deck is opened up in addition to having the fundamental Trinity advantage of being a monster up in the first place. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Extra Deck them in the</strong> <strong>Face</strong>: Rank 8s are pretty unfair across the board and never really get touched by the banlist because reasons. Abuse 'em. Additionally, we have ways of accessing both Chaos Angel and Bystial Dis Pater here though they shouldn't be the focus of your attacks. Spirit and Azure represent plenty of pressure and are generally safer to go for.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Cons:</strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Big Level Big Brick</strong>: So many level 8s are bound to eventually clog up hand real estate, it's a given. The Galaxy/Photon engine is also a little on the bricky side if you're severely behind and can't summon anything or too far ahead to the point where you can't make use of the cards effectively and you'd much rather have any of the other cards in the deck. It also goes without saying what the inclusion of the Rituals means for this deck; however, there are a few ways to convert them into playable states (mostly with Riot Dragon, but there's a myriad of ways of accessing Lord of the Red).<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Telegraphed Chokes Early</strong>: This only actually applies to early game as your GY and Banished setup later on shouldn't really have much in the way of counterplay. That said, if you can't reach that point due to being disrupted early, you'll have a really hard time recovering unless the rest of your hand can compensate for future turns.</li></ul><p><br />While the Cons list appears small, let it be stated that the two things listed there are a big deal and can be game losing on a regular basis. Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.</p><hr /><p><br /><strong>OPENERS<br /><br /></strong>Finding any of your components required for the below combo lines works the same regardless of the means of getting there. GY-centric Dragon deck design is pretty homogenous when it comes to support surrounding it so any combination of the necessary means of accessing these lines generally works the same. The main difference lines in what you're able to do after and cards in hand.<strong><br /></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Abyss Stares Back: </strong>Without a doubt my favorite opener and a really strong one concerning the various pivots offered to you, especially when going first. You'll want to simply find a means of resolving Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon, whether that be through a combination of cards to summon it and put a copy of BEWD in the GY so the effects can activate and resolve OR simply resolve a single copy of Dragon Shrine (or binning multiple cards in a turn) to put White Stone of Ancients and the vanilla BEWD in the GY, such that during the End Phase, you can beam out this monster and resolve its effects. You'll generally only need to do this once in a game, but if you're able to resolve the searches again and again (which is extremely greedy and not recommended mind you) then you're likely to run into a Maximus situation where the snowball is a bit out of control for the opponent. Regardless, our pivots in the opener are as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>Chaos Dragon Rank 8 Setup</strong>: This is actually done by default if you have White Stone of Ancients in GY. You'll use Abyss to grab Nebula Dragon so that during your next turn, you can banish Stone to recycle the vanilla in GY and summon out both Nebula and BEWD (in 1 summon by Trinity's ruleset), then convert the two into a Rank 8 minding Nebula's restriction. The one recommended the most is definitely Cipher as you can steal a monster then overlay on that stolen monster for Cipher X and let that be your third summon for the turn while keeping a 3k and 4k beatstick, sinking damage, and clearing a monster from your opponent's side.</li><li><strong>Ritual Setup</strong>: Easily the most underrated aspect of this card and can often take people by surprise, ESPECIALLY when it comes to games 2 and 3 where you're siding in the Shinobarons, Demise, and/or BLS depending on the matchup. Most hands will allow you to grab High Ritual Art so that you don't have to actually waste the 2nd search from Abyss on the Ritual Monster itself. Borreload Riot Dragon actually synergized very well thanks to this (much in the same way Illusion of Chaos does) as it can negate a summon, destroy itself, then still be useful while in the GY instead of being shuffled away. Lord of the Red can be accessed regardless either permanently by searching Advanced Ritual Art and itself with solely Abyss resolving or temporarily with High Ritual Art. All of the side decked considerations can be accessed regardless of Dragon synergy thanks to High Ritual Art.</li><li><em>Remember, this thing also has a GY effect to just give all of your big guys 1k attack each...<br /></em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Extra Deck Ascension:</strong> You can open with a Rank 8 or Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and be completely fine when it comes to Trinity. Negations are generally more favored regardless of if you're going first or second.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Meet &amp; Beat:&nbsp;</strong>Very straightforward opener and likely the one to go to as the safest option unless you're Heavy Storm baiting. Just summon a 3k beatstick or two, look at your opponent, and tell them to deal with it. Sometimes converting things into an ED play is a misplay simply because it represents less damage on an opponent who had no answer to begin with. In the event that they do, depending on the number of beatsticks you can continue to conga line out in typical Chaos fashion, your opponent will eventually just be overwhelmed from the main deck.</li></ul><p>It goes without saying that the Abyss opener is highly favored in this build and makes the deck ultimately immutable when it comes to variants as the Abyss setup only uses 1 Summon in the turn (allowing for things like monsters with powerful Normal Summon/Field effects to be played like Dogmatika, Cyber Dragon, or Ancient Warrior).</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This will primarily come down to your ability to manipulate the GY and banished and where the only real skill of the deck's lines can come into fruition between pilots who aren't just OTKing their opponents. Mind your decisions.</p><ul><li><strong>Starliege Seyfert and Nebula Dragon:</strong> Both of these cards have GY recycling effects. Notably, Seyfert actually has a loop with Chaos Emperor that lets you access it again; however, Emperor can also recycle things like Alternative, White Stone, and Ringowurm so it's ultimately up to you to decide. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>GY Summon Gang: </strong>Master with Eyes of Blue, Keeper of Dragon Magic, and True Light will be your main ways of representing follow-ups purely in guaranteed special summons or just as a defensive line.</li></ul><p>Games will more than likely be over within the first couple of turns due to the nature of Trinity and this deck but in the event they aren't and go late then we have contigencies and closers there as well.<br /><br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon: </strong>Searchable by Seyfert and Melody, this thing just steals games through burn damage alone most of the time and has no attacking restrictions anyway, representing a hilarious amount of burst damage in just this card alone. In the event it doesn't even win the game on the spot, it can beam out a level 8 from hand/GY (including the Ritual Dragons) and convert into a Rank 8 afterwards with no restrictions barring summons left for that turn. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon is seriously unfun for the opponent to deal with after it resolves and you'll primarily be using it with either a normal set Stone or just wiping your Field Spells/useless backrow to clear away at least 2 cards on average with the topend in testing being upwards of 4. The kicker of it all is that afterwards, if you have means of just special summoning out your guys you can just spam them all out and generally go for game in the most unfair way possible with the only real counterplay being negation on CED or uh... Battle Fader?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Protection Effects: </strong>Return of the Dragon Lords, The Ultimate Creature of Destruction, Dingirsu, and Sky Dragon Overlord allow you to embrace risky business with very little in the way of counterplay. Just push your advantage and take risks when you have these around. The opponent often just loses the game outright as a result.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />As stated in the introduction, this build is susceptible to adjustments solely because of the Chaos attributes and nature of Albaz support constantly shifting around. One day we may be playing like this while another we may find ourselves performing Ultra Polymerization combos with Alba-Len, there isn't any real way to assess things so let what's here represent not only a benchmark but also paths to branch from based on the various options provided in that of Rituals, Chaos, Xyz, and Synchro playstyles with Blue-Eyes. To further lean into those respective strategies or more, here's a few suggestions:</p><p><br />Viability Boosters: <em>Albaz Dragon Engine | Chaos Engine | Bystial | Mannadium | Melffy &amp; Crimson Dragon Support</em><br /><br />General Purpose: <em>Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Felgrand Dragons, Galaxy Photon support, Slot Machine Mill, Chaos Dragon Levianeer, Multiple copies of White Stone of Ancients<br /></em></p><p>As per usual, thanks for reading this if you have. This one's been in the works for sometime and I regret having not uploaded it nearly half a year ago. With what's out now I can safely say that it may've been for the better but alas, dallying on fun ideas for popular archetypes from the anime isn't great and doesn't really help with promoting the format's depth and variety. I hope you enjoy piloting and/or dissecting the deck to suit your needs.</p><hr /><p><strong>55 Card Deck = 5 Points with 5p used.</strong><br />1p Dragon Shrine (Extra Copy)<br />1p Dragon Shrine (Extra Copy)<br />1p Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon<br />1p Chaos Angel<br />.5p Melody of Awakening Dragon<br />.5p Heavy Storm</p><p>There's no escape!
