From here on, use ""Primal Seed"" cards to cycle combo pieces. As long as you target ""Primal Seed"" cards with each other, it won't be a problem.</p><p>2) Place ""Light Barrier"" and Special Summon Arcana, either via Saryuja or with ""Monster Reborn"", if discarded by Dugares/Ravenous. Choose the outcome of&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to skip your opponent's turn at the cost of two of your monsters being delivered to GY. Don't send Arcana and Chaos by accident and make sure you have two monsters available, which can be arranged with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>3) Set all of ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" and one of ""Primal Seed"" cards. End your turn but not before changing ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch+Hold"" and setting to ""ON"" in-game to not miss any action, which can be edited in ""Duel"" section of settings page.</p><p>4) It's your turn now. Activate all of ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" trap cards.</p><p>5) Now, here is infinite burn. Revive a Machine monster (e.g: Martial) with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroy it with ""Offerings to the Doomed"". Rinse and repeat for constant 300 x 3 = 900 damage in total until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Arcana"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Cyber Summon Blaster"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 690 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

The United States, known for its global influence, made a serious mistake in underestimating the power of the enemy. After intense conflict, China has emerged as a formidable force, imbued with impressive military might. However, amid this turmoil, an unexpected partnership began to play a significant role in the war: Brazil.</p><p>Quietly, Brazil, driven by a sense of justice and solidarity, decided to help China in its battle against the European powers. Help arrived in a variety of ways, from the full of economic resources to the leak of American information to the Chinese on Brazilian soil.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the United States, authorities frantically debated where this crucial aid to the enemy came from. Military analysts, with their sharp minds, combed through countless intelligence reports, trying to figure out where these essential resources for China came from. However, the secret of Brazil and China was well guarded, unable to be unraveled.</p><p>Amidst this geopolitical strife, a new voice has begun to emerge: that of America's youth. Tired of seeing their country's youth sent to the battlefield, they refused to join the war. A large demonstration was raised among the American population who did not want to have their children killed in the war, a wave of protests across the country.</p><p>This insurrection, however, was not enough to change the course of the war. Hostilities continued, and as the months passed, the United States found itself increasingly weak. China, in collaboration with Russia, Brazil and South Africa, formed a powerful and efficient alliance, leaving the Americans with no way out.</p><p>In the end, the defeat of the United States was decisive. The military power of the United Nations against the country was overwhelming and, gradually, its lines of defense were being broken. China has emerged as a big winner, sealing its position as a world superpower alongside its powerful allies Brazil, Russia and South Africa.</p>"

With Kite, I actually have a lot to work with, as he was seen using many cards from Photon Shockwave in his introductory duel, along with a few older cards. (Though it's strange that he was using Goddess with the Third Eye as a filler. Even when he got a Fusion monster later that season, fusion substitutes don't work for it.)</p><p>As part of the exercise, I'm assuming Kite was one of the first people to get cards from the Photon Shockwave set (even aside from the Photon monsters which would not have been distributed to the public in that world). It's a privilege of working for the people designing and printing the cards in his world. But anything past that wasn't even on the drawing board when he was initially fielded. That said, if there's anything that can be done to refine the deck within these restrictions, feel free to make suggestions.</p>"

This version banks on the fact it can easily go first (setting up Fossil Dyna and Secret Village) whilst maintaining the powerful plays it has going second. I had a lot of fun with Vaylantz and its definitely a great deck to keep around. It will probably never be meta, but is occasionally topping some events, especially in the OCG.</p><p>Have fun!</p><p>The decklist belonging to the videos about the floodgate version of Vaylantz. In the side deck you'll find cards that I want to add, but just wasn't able to craft just yet. Thus the deck can be made slightly better.&nbsp;</p><p>P.s. if you have questions, watch the Vaylantz videos on my channel or post a comment under one of the videos. Thx!</p>"
