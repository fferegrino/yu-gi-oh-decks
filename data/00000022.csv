(Original list: https://ygoprodeck.com/magistus-post-bode/) A lot of time has passed since my last update so here's a list to get people who are thinking of building this deck a few more lists to think about as BODE is right around the corner (4 days I believe?). Anyways this is going to be less in depth when compared to my old list since a lot of the reasonings/purpose of the cards remain the same as before. For the sake of ease, I'll be calling the Lvl4 Spellcasters with ED versions by these names (Verre for Rilliona Zoroa for Lvl4 Zoroa.) Likewise, the ED monsters are Rilliona for the XYZ and Daimon for Zoroa Synchro.  Description:  Magistus is a Spellcaster focused deck that focuses on the younger versions of your favorite spellcaster monsters.  List Time:  Magistus Engine (19 Cards - 12 Monsters 7 Spells)  Starters: Rilliona, Zoroa, Endymion  Extenders: Vrtira, Crowley, Trismagistus  3x Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre: The S/T Searcher for the deck. One of the 9 Starters (and the arguably worst one). It is the typically the target to search off Artemis if you already have Crowley in hand for followup.  3x Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame: Tuner of the deck. Serves as a starter as it can special summon another lv4 spellcaster from your hand/gy or attach Artemis to get to Crowley if you have spellcaster handtraps.  3x Endymion, the Magistus of Mastery:  Starter that gets to Artemis and allows you to cycle through your deck.  3x Crowley, the Magistus of Grimores:  Extender for the deck and typically the first choice of monster to grab off Artemis. His ability to change attributes comes up if you have two Crowleys on board for Rilliona XYZ (who needs two separate attributes) and for Toadally Awesome.  3x Vritra: Another extender which revives a Magistus from the GY. Typically the card you'll grab from Verre on your  3x Trismagistus: Serves as a soul charge and extender for monsters stuck in hand. Has battle protection for your Magistus monsters that are Equipped with an equip card.  1x Magistus Theurgy: Brought down from the two that I used to run. It's a nice card to have in hand/start off with but mostly serves as a way to make Rilliona a starter by itself.  Serves as an extender against Imper/Veiler for any of the starters. Can also flip in Game 1 if you equipped the wrong cards to Zoroa.  Generic Cards: x21  Hand-Traps: Droll &amp; Lock Bird, Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence  3x Droll &amp; Lock and 3x Veiler are really interesting HTs as they are also spellcasters. Going first opening multiple of drolls or uneeded veilers is fine as Crowley can discard these cards to special himself out.  3x Infinite Impermanence- I choose to run this to combat the upcoming meta however this is up to you and what you choose to run. It's a solid Hand-Trap either way as it counteract cards like TTT.  3x Pot of Desires: Draw 2 with all the important cards being 3 ofs. What more can I say?  2x Spell Power Mastery: Another 2 copies of Endymion. Adds to the consistency of this deck.  3x Triple Tactics Talents: A super strong going second or going first card. If you can't afford this feel free to run more handtraps.  1x Called by the Grave: Self-Explanatory card. Can negate a Hand-trap/card your opp uses.  3x Solemn Strike - A personal tech choice that I have. Strike is a really strong card to counteract your opponent and makes the Tenyi Swordsoul Matchup easier (Negates Vishuda).  Side Deck: (Modify to your locals)  Notable Cards are specifically Invocation and Secret Village of the Spellcasters.  Invocation is in the side rather the main deck as it's honestly a brick in the hand. Through my testing, I felt as making Aiwass was a waste of resources as it isn't a real proper negate and typically people side in backrow hate against Zoroa, so making Aiwass is less then worth it. That being said, It's sided for matchups that do not use the ED.  Secret Village - Best card of generic spellcaster support. Negates spell cards that your opponent has. Feel free to main it as well :).  Extra Deck: (going to just copy this from my old post)  2x Artemis - the best equip card that the deck has. It allows the search for any of our Magistus monsters that we need in hand.  1x Ninanruru - Our S/T removal other then cosmic. Can be useful to force activation of cards. Also has a nifty effect to allow two attacks on monsters.  1x Vahram - The main target to equip to Zoroa. Gives Zoroa a construct-like send and S/T protection. Also has a boardwipe effect that burns all face-up cards. Just like the fiery bird it is.  1x Aiwass - Our target for Fusion matchups. Can also be made with Invocation in matchups that don't use the ED. Don't forget the atk/def gain effect to hit over monsters.  2x Rilliona - Typically the card that allows the search for baby Zoroa. Allows us to consistently go into Zoroa. Remember that this card locks us into Magistus ED monsters. Also has a neat effect to negate a monster on your turn.  1x Zoroa, the Magistus of Daimon - Our main t1 board usually revolves around him. Important to realize that Zoroa says the cards don't have to be attached to him to do the floodgate effect and that Zoroa works no matter where the ED monster attempts to activate. Also has a neat reincarnation effect that becomes useful for plays later on and to reestablish the lock. Can be ran at 1 or 2 - up to your preference.  1x Bahmaut Shark/1x Toadally Awesome - fans of this deck already knows about these cards. You typically make this with Endmyion and Crowley (by changing Crowley to water). Another play to play around Nibiru or to have another negation on the board.  1x Halq/Selene/Accesscode - Standard Accesscode link climb combo. Make Halq with Zoroa and another monster then SS Veiler. Then link into Selene and revive another spellcaster. Then go into Accesscode. Typically the play that you will do to end the game.  1x Heartland Draco/Zeus: Heartland Draco has the ability to be able to attack directly to go into Zeus. Zeus is Zeus - a strong quick effect board wipe.  Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the list and happy dueling!"

With the July 21 banlist I thought it was really cool having to reinvent how the deck works having to do <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> to return the <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus </a>to the GY on the opponent's SP but I wasn't yet comfortable with how the deck could play against interactions and have a satisfying grind game because I'm a combo player who prefers to take advantage plays with good follow ups and minimal interactions to ensure I survive the opponent's turn and win the game easily on the back than someone who likes to put multiple negates in the table with an ftk field and the deck was missing something so I decided to stop playing with it until I found a new way to make the deck extend plays efficiently after hand traps. Now I bring you the solution I found which was to use the Archetype of Ogdoadic as an engine to complement the strategy and I am very happy with the synergies I found between the two engines. As you can see in the decklist I'm using a very reduced Dino engine because I don't want to brick with this deck and the Ogdoadic cards already improve my Grind Game a lot so I'm worried about increasing this number and the only card I'd really like to having space to use on the main deck is <a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops </a>but for now I'm testing it on the side deck. The Ogdoadic engine is also reduced and I chose to use only the cards necessary for its basic functioning and which has synergy with the Dino engine cards as well. Finally there was still room for 8 tech cards which is a number that guarantees seeing at least 1 hand trap in the starting hand most of the time and I've already tested a lot using blind second cards like <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and I say that besides being a lot of guys i often analyze replays of matches i play and if they were hand traps instead they would have been much more effective, of course there are decks where you use a hand trap and he keeps playing as if nothing had happened but most of the time a well given hand trap does affect a lot of the opponent's plays. Not to mention that this deck can use the best hand trap in the game in my opinion which is the <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> in the main deck and the <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> I use instead of the Effect Veiler because first you don't use much tech card and Impermanence is a live Trap if you give it 6th card draw which Veiler is not and although I have <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler</a> in Extra Deck I have better cards to add to the hand like Tyranno or <a data-name=""Oviraptor"">Oviraptor </a>than I mill to gy. Finally about the extra deck I'm satisfied at the moment with the choices made and I just miss not having room for another generic Rank 4 like <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>. Overall I wouldn't add any more cards for Links monsters and the Rank 8 engine and I'm testing <a data-name=""Borreload Savage"">Borreload Savage</a> instead of <a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a> because in the grind game it's very easy to do and helps a lot to have a more solid win condition . As this deck has little room for tech and Ogdoadic's cards are a plus for the opponent if he has monsters in the GY so I always play first differently from other versions of Dino I used and I'm doing a lot of testing hands so I can see all the possibilities to extend plays after hand traps which is the purpose of the deck: pass with a field that guarantees you to survive the opponent's turn with versatile interactions and very good follow ups. The basic deck combo is to do the standard Scrap Dino moves like Oviraptor + Baby, Misc + Baby, Archosaur + Baby, Lost World + Oviraptor etc and the first extra deck monster you make is Evolzar Dolkka most of the time already guaranteeing you play around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru </a>and other random hand traps that are bad against Dino's engine but good against other deck engines like Ghost Belle. Then you access the Ogdoadic engine through the King of the Feral Imps and that's where comes why this engine works in the deck but for that I'll explain this story of the standard combo in more detail:  Oviraptor + Baby = Misc + Baby = Archosaur + Baby = Oviraptor + Misc In any of these combos you will get the following board: Oviraptor + Baby + Scrap Raptor + Archosaur (or Linkuriboh in the case of the Archosaur + Baby combo) + Double Evolution Pill in the Hand Now we are going to do the sequence: Scrap Raptor eff target itself --- Scrap Raptor gy effect to add Chimera ---NS Scrap Chimera and effect --- SS Scrap Raptor and make Evolzar Dolkka using Scrap Raptor and Oviraptor as material --- after you must do Linkuriboh because even if you don't need it to banish from gy with the Double Evolution Pill it is important because it has the Dark attribute to be banned by Chaos Ruler.  Then you Link Summon <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a> with Linkuriboh and Chimera and make the standard Scrap Raptor summon from the deck and destroy the Babycerasaurus that will bring the Giant Rex. Here you can choose to play safe and make <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> to add <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya </a>to your hand because he is the best starter of the Ogdoadic engine. Or go for a more aggressive play and do Chaos Ruler which aims to get mill o Nauya or <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu </a>or any combination of <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt </a>+ any Reptile monster. Using the example of King of the Feral Imps after adding Nauya to the hand we will use his effect and send Keurse to the GY and that way the basic Ogdoadic combo can happen with <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse </a>taxing the King of the Feral Imps and bringing back Nauya to the field for the second effect which will add the <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> to the hand and we will use that to send Aleirtt to the GY. Finally Aleirtt will tax the banished Nauya and enter the field activating the second very important effect of returning two banished monsters to the gy including a Reptile monster so we will return the <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus </a>to the gy in our turn and make <a data-name=""Number 38"">Number 38</a> or <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu </a>with both level 8 bodies on the field and now we use the Double Evolution Pill to bring Tyranno to the field and Giant Rex back to be the monster to be destroyed with Tyranno's effect. The final board will be: Tyranno + Dolkka + Giant Rex + Scrap Wyvern + Number 38 or Dingirsu. Most of the time I choose Number 38 as the final board but <a data-name=""Number 68"">Number 68</a> is also very good and Dingirsu i make in the first turn when you know you are facing trap decks because the way a trap deck breaks your field is by destroying your cards and Dingirsu prevents this from happen. This combo is unorthodox and you can try other ways to do it because while Chaos Ruler has the advantage of being used as xyz material and you may not need to add a Reptile to your hand depending on how good the mills are but add Oviraptor for the hand for example what does it mean to be an extra body in the grind game and have Oviraptor to follow up in hand or do the combo via King of the Feral Imps which allows you to access more Ogdoadic names in the GY which makes your own Grind Game on the part of this much better engine. But we can also do simpler combos like <strong>Nunu + any Lv4 Dino = I:P Masquerena + Aron</strong>. This combo is interesting because you can risk opening with Giant Rex or Miscellaneousaurs + <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu </a>you use the two effects of Nunu and you will have her on the field when you give NS Dino Lv4 and you continue with <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> combo like me already I mentioned but here how you will have done <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> when activating the <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> you will have 4 Reptiles in the GY so you can reborn a Reptile to the field in the resolution and that will be <a data-name=""Aron, the Ogdoadic King"">Aron, the Ogdoadic King</a> who will be able to use his two effects on opponent's turn being one of discarding a card from his hand after he adds something and another of adding a Reptile from the deck or gy to the hand if he sees an opponent's monster being sent to the gy such as when he does Link Summon and this is important because you will have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> discard cost paid without using other cards from your hand or discarding another card from your hand but at least having a normal summon next turn to make Ogdoadic plays again. In other words, this end board seems little but it's actually decent to do. Other combos I noticed with the deck: <strong>Nauya + any monster = Number 97 or Number 38</strong>. This is good if for example you give NS Ovirapor and the opponent denies it to extend moves and pass with something that guarantees you to survive. <strong>Snake Rain + Discard = Numeron Dragon OTK and Ogdoadic Spell/Trap in Hand</strong> Or <strong>Snake Rain + Discard = I:P Masquerena + Aron</strong> - exactly the same combo as Nunu + any Lv4 Dino only changing the beginning as you don't need to spend Normal Summon which means if your opponent clears your field a single Snake Rain will be or a Rank 8 or that I:P Masquerena + Aron combo. <strong>Scrap Raptor = Rank 8</strong> - Here you can extend a little Scrap Raptor play to access some Ogoadic cards and pass with an Rank 8 and good Ogdoadic names in the GY. <strong>Archosaur + Giant Rex or Miscellaneousaurus = Rank 8</strong>. In this example instead of adding the Double Evolution Pill you add Nauya and make the default Nauya + any monster combo. <strong>Oviraptor + Double Evolution Pill = Tyranno + Rank 8 + Misc in GY</strong> - Again we are going to use the <a data-name=""Archosaur"">Archosaur </a>to add the Nauya to the hand but this time we need the Double Evolution Pill to get a Reptile out of the GY before using the effect of <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt </a>to return Misc to the GY and that way we make a decent pitch while keeping a lot of great follow ups.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Chaos Ruler ROTA = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Aron + Number 38</strong> - Here you open with Combo plus Nunu and as this Oviraptor will most likely take hand trap it makes sense to ensure you have some play starting using Nunu's two effects and that way you are obliged to start the combo by doing King of the Feral Imps however the only difference on the end board will be that you don't have access to the Giant Rex unless you mill it with Chaos Ruler eff. In this combo you will be able to make Chaos Ruler using a Scrap Raptor and a Nauya that will be reborn with Keurse and this Chaos Ruler comes back from the gy to make a Rank 8.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Borreload Savage ROTA = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Borreload Savage + Rank 8</strong> - Here you do Savage instead of Chaos Ruler but I prefer the other final board because Chaos Ruler as part of your follow up is really good.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Chaos Ruler ROTA = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + I:P Masquerena + Number 38</strong> - These combos you play as Dino normally having access to Dolkka on the end board different from the combo made with Nunu so you get a lot more interactions.  <strong>Ovirapor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Borreload Savage ROTA = Tyranno + Dolkka + Borreload Savage + Number 38</strong>  <strong>Snake Rain + Scrap Raptor = I:P Masquerena + Bagooska /in GY: Chaos Ruler + all the Ogdoadic names /in Hand: Search of Chaos Ruler</strong> - Again this Chaos Ruler will be done after summoning Nauya with Keurse and after doing I:P Masquerena you will have the Scrap Chimera on the field so the spell Ogdoadic Water Lily will summon from any lv4 Reptile to make Bagooska.  <strong>Snake Rain + Oviraptor the 3 possible situations</strong>: First: Archosaur add Double Evolution Pill and make Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena /in Hand: Double Evolution Pill + Ogdoadic Water Lily /in GY: Misc + 3 ogdoadic names Second: add Misc and don't use it and passes with I:P Masquerena + Aron /in Hand: Ogdoadic Monster added with King of the Feral Imps + Miscellaneousaurus.  Third: Use Archosaur to add an Ogdoadic name and pass with I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Misc and all the Ogdoadic names. This combo is also possible if the Snake Rain discard is a Reptile so you can add the Pill straight to the hand which is much better.

What started as a 40 dollar budget deck (that apparently beat Invoked Shaddolls and got 5th place in a 30 man tourney) has evolved into a link/syncho/ritual deck that can support even Cyber Slash Harpie Lady, Baronne de Fleur and Borrelsword Dragon.  &nbsp;  While I went about adjusting the extra deck, i realized that i could technically go into links if I were using tokens and Linkuriboh, so I've gone ahead and done that. Magikeys are also used in order to run synchro monsters in this deck.  &nbsp;  You have to be <span><strong>really careful</strong></span> when going about summoning your monsters because your Impcantations lock up your extra deck while there's even a single one on the board. As long as you know how to do basic addition and subtraction, you'll get the hang of it.  &nbsp;  EDIT 1: Vanity's Fiend is an OP monster in this deck, lmao  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: This deck sucks going second, so i tried to alleviate that as much as I could. You could probably get away with running a 42 card deck by taking out one of the Droplets (to be honest, you can also run Dark Ruler No More if price is an issue), but i highly recommend running the 3 Nibiru and 3 Re-Spark since Stardust Dragon gives you extra negates while also serving as a body on the field. But yeah, i had to throw something in there to stop monsters like Dragoon since they can cut your turn short.  &nbsp;  EDIT 3: The deck list speaks for itself. I've decided to add Deskbot/Halqifibrax support into it. While i normally don't like to use Halqifibrax (since i like to build more casual decks), its honestly a necessity in this deck when it comes to applying real pressure. Other than that, i've taken out the Resparks (you could also run Dark Ruler No More as opposed to Droplets if money is an issue), and i've moved stuff like Vanity and Nibiru to the side deck.  &nbsp;  EDIT 4: I've embraced the fat deck strategy after seeing a Magikey Megalith build on mkohl40's channel. After having done this, my hand consistency has gotten a lot better. It also helps that I'm running Magikey World and the PSY-Framelord Gamma kit in here now, along with 3 copies of Prosperity. Emergency Teleport can also target Penciplume, which is great for getting ritual monsters out of the graveyard. In all honesty, i don't know how i'd further improve this deck. This looks complete to me, but i may find some room for optimization in the extra deck and side deck. I'm not removing the Shooting Star Dragon kit (at least not at the moment) because it's really funny that this deck can technically go into Shooting Star Dragon.  &nbsp;  EDIT 5: Realized there was a better Shooting Star Dragon i could go into. I can also go into it using my Halqifibrax Combo assuming i can follow up with Debris Dragon in my hand to pull Candoll out of my GY and go into Stardust Dragon. Going into Cyberse Quantum Dragon is really important to me in this deck since it gives me protection, so I'd have to forego the Herald for my level 4 synchro tuner.  &nbsp;  EDIT 6: Running Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing in the main deck now. I also threw out the level 4 synchro tuner for Shooting Riser Dragon.  &nbsp;  EDIT 7: So i'm probably going to stop updating this now unless new cards come out that can further improve this. I feel like i've pushed this deck as far as it can go at the moment for the non-budget build, and i've already finished making my IRL build for the Big Mac Synchro Turbo (which can be viewed here: https://ygoprodeck.com/big-mac-synchro-turbo/). If anyone has any further suggestions, feel free to comment on this page.  &nbsp;  EDIT 8 (final edit): I thought it couldn't be done, but here it is... True Synchro Burger Turbo. This includes a pipeline that doesn't require Halqifibrax using Mare Mare. Its just very reassuring to know that this deck can operate without the need of Halqifibrax now if we ever get into a situation where its ever banned. I'll be making incremental updates to this page as i figure out the side deck, but otherwise, i think i have it all figured out now."

Upon Summon they add you a Floowandereeze Spell or Trap to hand and then allows you to Normal Summon <em>any</em> monster (this will come up later). He reduces the ATK of the monster it's battling and functions as a Floodgate against Link Monsters.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a></span><span>, a literal winged beast, and</span> <span><a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a></span><span>, a winged beast without wings and a chicken head, are your boss monsters.</span>  <span>Then there's</span> <span>DD Crow</span><span>. This crow's a pacifist and despises murder, therefore it travels alone. If you already have access to Eaglen, which is usually the case past turn one or when you using the Field Spell, this is a great card to add off of Robina.</span>  <span>The plan is to summon Robina to search Eaglen who then searches Empen to then adds you Dreaming Town. When summoning Empen you can add your Level 1 bird back to hand to do this all over again during your opponent's turn, this time summoning either Avian or Raiza.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>...AND DIVINE WRATH.</span>  <span>Well this took a turn for the extreme. The Extra Deck really doesn't matter much in this deck, allowing for a small Dogmatika engine. I'm saying small since - oh yeah I should probably mention you can't Special Summon the turn you use any of your birds effects - you can't Special Summon and cards like Fleur and Nexus need to sit this one out. Yet strangely enough, there's a lot of synergy between this engine and the birds.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Ferrijit</a></span> <span>can be sent to add</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Ecclesia</a></span><span>, allowing you to draw deeper into your deck and unbricking your hand.</span> <span><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Shuraig</a></span> <span>can search you Robina or any other Level 1 Winged Beast as long as one tri-type is banished already.</span>  <span>Ecclesia can be Normal Summoned at the end of your combo using Empen's effect (I told you it'll come up) to search you</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a></span> <span>for extra interruption.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Certain choices and contrivances to conjure celestial conquest</span>  <span>If you don't know what that means don't worry, me neither. What I do know is that this deck leaves a lot of room for intricate maneuvers.</span>  <span>Once your opponent is out of ressources Raiza can essentially Yata-Lock your opponent by stacking their deck with a bad card and bouncing Raiza ever turn.</span>  <span>Gold Sarc allows for every Floowandereeze to start your combo by banishing Robina (or Eaglen). It also gives you an extra chainblock.</span>  <span>Dimension Shifter can single handedly buy you a turn or win you a game. It conflicts with the Dogmatika engine but Ferrijit can rid you of D Shifter if you don't need it.</span>  <span>If you have both the Field Spell and Dreaming Town you can conduct a Normal Summon Twice, allowing you to summon Apex Avian upon their first Normal Summon, use it's effect and then summon Apex Avian again while flipping every monster your opponent controls face-down.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a></span> <span>can shut down control decks completely and</span> <span><a data-name=""Rallis the Star Bird"">Rallis the Star Bird</a></span> <span>has 3200 ATK if you're facing a</span> <span><a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a></span><span>. The only other way to out Sigma is by having a Level 1 Bird left on your side of the field and one in hand or the Field Spell face-up and two birds in hand (both very common) to go into</span> <span><a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</a></span><span>, swing for some direct damage, overlay into a 4 material</span> <span><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a></span> <span>and hope your opponent is forced to crash them. Everything else in the Extra Deck is more or less moo. I doesn't matter.</span>"

It a fun deck it has new OCG cards the original idea for this is ""Ha I see your cards""  Ghost sister in this deck because I enjoy her effect gain life for each special summons but it come with a kick that if they don’t mine LP is half instead so I used at the started the draw phase but after reading this I just might have a chain with your fusion spell. There all the “spying/reveling” two ignored mine opponents so they used their spell/trap destroy and miss and hit waking the dragon two special summon the un-kill-able Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons…well you still can send it awhile or I could use mind crush to send there good card away.  Then there the legendary Baronne de Fleur definitely a great flower rose with the thorns if you play it wrong, you might just drop it. How I was going to Synchro the card(so heartless)  by Wandering Gryphon Rider summons it on mine opponent turn and then drawing Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood for Synchro into 10.  Mind control to take control of a monster and link summons to keep a monster on mine field. Then lastly mine favorited new cards top share and gift exchange; first I used top share to have the opponent pick the card they needed and put it on the top of deck then used gift exchange to shuffle their deck…it was so closed.  At last Mimicking Man-Eater Bug the monster that can’t be destroyed in battle for that extra protections.  Well at least no one has the time to read thanks anyway.  Sincerely,  Professor M.

Anyway I found that Small World actually works really well in this deck and it can be even better with the Destiny Hero engine I included in the deck. Small World and the Destiny Hero engines that I included in the deck can be swapped for Desires/Solemn Strike/Dragoon Engine/Zeus Package or something of the sort. This deck has so much free space and is fun to see what all can fit in the deck. Currently the deck is 43 cards, and if you have any other suggestions on some other cards I would be happy to see any input in the comments. Also here are some Small World lines of play that could be used.  Gamma/Ash/Fraktall (in hand) -&gt; Kitt (in deck) -&gt; Rescue Cat (adds to hand)  Effect Veiler (in hand) -&gt; Ash (in deck) -&gt; Fraktall/Kitt/Nervall (adds to hand)  Destiny Hero Celestial (in hand) -&gt; Fraktall (in deck) -&gt; Kitt (adds to hand)  Psy-Frame Driver (in hand) -&gt; Destiny Hero Dasher (in deck) -&gt; Kitt (adds to hand)  These are the most optimal ways I have found that Small World can be used in the deck, and using Crow also has some cool interactions in the deck. Also it has the added bonus of being able to unbrick your hand if you open garnets or too many handtraps. Anyways this is my spicy version of Tri-Brigade after BODE, hope you guys enjoy."

Going first build, only 4 handtraps main. ","Swordsoul Tenyi can make Chaofeng with Baxia which will prevent our opponent from activating any light monster effects next turn. This is very good vs DRYTRON. Swordsoul Tenyi can play through 2-3 handtraps and still end on a decent board with Fleur (Omninegate), Grandmaster (on field monster negate) and Dragite (Spell Negate).  This swordsoul build tries to SS at least one Tenyi first to go into Monk, then SS Longyuan to make Fleur, NS Taia / Mo Ye to make Grandmaster, fetch Summit, SS Moye/Taia to make Dragite. End board is Fleur, Grandmaster, Dragite. If we start with 2 Tenyis, we can make Grandmaster without a single NS. If we start with Vessel, we can also set up enough tenyis to make Grandmaster. If we get handtrapped on the NS, we can go into Tenyi Shaman LINK2 to discard and SS from GY to trigger another Swordsoul. We can use Vessel and Dragon Circle as extenders and even to chain on veiler/Imperm on Taia/Mo Ye so that we still get the tokens. Opening Dragonsword is a one card combo: add and NS Taia, make Grandmaster cl1, cl2 Taia dump Mo Ye (chainblocking ash), add Summit, SS Mo Ye from GY with Summit, make Dragite, draw 1, have 2 negates on board.  Pot of Desires is perfect in this deck because we usually do not care about banishing 10 cards, also draw 2 without compromising the Mo Ye draw is really good (Prosperity compromises the Mo Ye draw which is very bad).  Weaknesses: Token Collector: We play 2 Ghost Belle to stop token collector +1 more in side. Shenshen can help, the Duke can take care of it, Vishuda can bounce it.  Sky Striker/ Control Decks: Making Fleur with Longyuan is going -1. if we go first, we are down -1 as well. Swordsoul Tenyi is no combo deck generating tons of plus.

Being normal monsters, they are easy to cheat out from the deck using Successor Soul and Unexpected Dai respectively. Successor Soul is non-destruction removal but it requires us to tribute one of our own effect monsters and Unexpected Dai allows us enough swarming ability to make little extra deck plays. If you draw any of these normal monsters, use Moray of Greed to put them back. Citadel Whale, Legendary Fisherman II,  Sea Stealth Attack, and A Legendary Ocean form a little engine together. A Legendary Ocean lets us summon Citadel Whale with one tribute or Legendary Fisherman II with no tributes. Foolish Burial should be used on Piwraithe (A good Successor Soul sacrifice) or Citadel Whale. Arnis the Empowered Warrior can summon Glacier Aqua Madoor, who makes a dead Gogiga Gagagigo in hand useful, and is also a hand trap himself. Along with Ash Blossom, I have 4 Fire attribute monsters, allowing me to teach Frost and Flame Dragon which is a free summon with removal. Rage of Kairyu-Shin works off original levels so it is good with this deck as well, adding more removal. Dragon's Mirror lets you summon First of the Dragons which is hard to out. Reasoning can get you a big monster for free, and you have a lot of levels so it is hard for them to guess correctly. Skill Drain is good for this deck as it uses almost no monster effects on the field. Raigeki, HFD, Reborn, and Called By are all staples.  The extra deck is a toolbox that works with or without ALO's level modulation.  The new support from Duelists of the Abyss will probably make me want to redesign this deck to use the new WATER support, so I figured I'd share it before its outdated!  The side deck is a few other options: Rescue Rabbit &gt; Unexpected Dai | Hope Harbinger &gt; Abyssgaios | Eria &gt; Gagagigo the Risen"

When going first, the deck can usually either end on a simple Platinum Gadget and ABC-Dragon Buster or that same combination in addition to I:P Masquerena which allows for the likes of Appaloosa, Goddess of the Bow or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World to be summoned on the opponent's turn for additional disruption. Even in the worst case scenario wherein a tagged out ABC-Dragon Buster gets negated by the likes of something like Called by the Grave, the inclusion of Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax allows for a powerful wall monster to be summoned that can disrupt your opponent to some degree when sent to the GY.  On your second turn, or even your first when going second depending on your hand, you're usually capable of finishing off the opponent by link climbing into Accesscode Talker through abusing the effect of C-Crush Wyvern and sequentially summoning the Knightmare monsters. The deck primarily relies on handtraps, with more traditional trap cards being sided in for subsequent games, to increase the effectiveness of Crossout Designator while simultaneously disrupting your opponent in the event of them going first. The inclusion of PSY-Framegear Gamma aids in disrupting your opponent if you're forced to go second while otherwise countering their handtraps and gaining additional advantage for yourself through the summon of PSY-Framelord Omega or a link monster on your first turn.  In order to avoid bricking, this build runs two copies of Union Driver. If you run but a single copy, you have a 12.5% chance of drawing it when going first in contrast to having a 1.28% chance of drawing both copies when running two. Drawing a lone copy of Union Driver isn't particularly terrible, either, if you have another in deck. In the absence of drawing one of your ABC monsters alongside Union Hanger in your opening hand, possessing a single Union Driver in their place still allows you to end on either ABC-Dragon Buster and I:P Masquerena or those two monsters in addition to Platinum Gadget, a choice entirely dependent on which potential handtrap you fear at the time, due to the nature of C-Crush Wyvern's effect, which only activates if you already possess a valid target to be special summoned in your hand at the time of activation, and your ability to choose whether to resolve the effect of C-Crush Wyvern or B-Buster Drake first.  The sidedeck has been built to increase your chances of victory when going first through incorporating powerful trap cards. Said side deck also features additional handtraps that further increase the viability of Crossout Designator when going first or better disrupt your opponent when going second. Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion also has the added benefit of protecting your cards from the likes of D D Crow, Ally of Justice Cycle Reader, and even Called by the Grave in addition to better disrupting your opponent depending on their deck.  With that said, I am interested in any suggestions pertaining to the main, side, or extra deck especially as the metagame evolves."

Once you feel like it is safe go for the kill with your invoked monsters. Another thing is the Dogmatika Engine that is used to keep control on the board and is just more material for Mechaba.  The way the swarm works is you get Aleister ASAP, use magical meltdown to get aleister or draw it normally and quickly get yourself an Invocation so  that you can loop the combo of, 1. Normal Aleister and add Invocation 2. fuse into a monster of choice 3. Use invocation's effect to return it to the deck and Aleister to your hand to re-enter the loop next turn. Then slowly but surely your entire board will be filled with monsters that can take your opponent out."

You get full combo off of Nunu pitch Nauya then resummon Nunu and any other lv4 for King of the Feral Imps, add another Nauya and use it to send Keurse, tribute Feral Imps for Keurse then revive Nauya and add Water Lilly, Water Lilly can send Masked Chameleon then summon it since you should have 5 reptiles in grave. Synchro summon Mathmech Magma using Nauya and Chameleon then use Magma and Keurse to summon Bishbaalkin. Bishbaalkin summons 5 tokens to each side then link him off with one token for Reprodocus (make sure that Reproducus points to a token). Make the token under Reprodocus into a reptile then link the reptile token and another token into Reptilianne Echidna and link the remaining tokens and Reprodocus into Unchained Abomination. Use Echidna's effect and add Aron, the Ogdoadic King, any 2 level 4 reptiles and Performapal Lizardraw and Swincobra. Scale up your Performapals and pend summon the 2 lvl 4s and use them to summon Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame and use it's effect to discard Aron and give A-counters to your opponents tokens. Then use Lizardraw's effect to pop itself and draw 1 and use Unchained Abomination to pop Alien Shocktrooper. Shocktrooper can resummon a bunch of reptiles and now it's the hard part. You should either be able to special summon Reptilianne Coatl then summon Reptilianne Lamia or use Reptilianne Spawn to get either a lvl2 or 2 lvl1 tokens but either way is possible since you can search either card. Make Reptilianne Hydra and draw 5 cards by destroying the tokens on your opponents field.  This deck sucks but I kinda want to buy it."

This one remind one the first SD seto kiba and yugioh moto for me and mine little brother….he didn’t like playing as much. Even back then I always wonder how the yugioh moto Sd could every beat Seto kiba Sd back in toy R us which I think are all closed now.  Maiden with eyes of blue has a great combo with Apparition with Eyes of Blue by playing Apparition with Eyes of Blue first then summing Maiden with of blue for the bounce back and special summons of two blues eyes from with maiden effect and another with apparitions two fusion summon blues-eyes twin burst dragon if needed. Also Apparition with eyes of Blues is great two get Blue-eyes alternative white dragon and then destroy target monster on the field then used Apparitions effect to return and get dragon spirt of white well with the idea hand.  Blues –eyes jet dragon is well it speak for itself instead of destroying anything it return to the hand so it get you out of a lot of sticky situations, also you can special summons it from the field and the graveyard which must be nightmare for the opponent. The tyrant of d is great since you pick the target for the opponent monster to attack; then discard blue-eyes to special summon then special summon the blues-eyes from the graveyard. Mystical elf-mystical burst stream is in there for a another light monster with tyrant of d. special summon the blues-eyes used to summon tyrant and have tyrant effect to change the attack monster to blues-eyes white dragons.  Ultimate Fusion; I used it for Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon but I bet there a better way to used it but I haven’t been playing it much. Rage with Eyes of Blue is mine “BUCKET” card when the chips are just active that two get 3 blues-eyes and if they stay on the filed long enough to xyz to Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo for the 3 turn count down. Well that ideally but really it would normally only get since blue-eyes won’t summon in the graveyard with this spell card :’( The Melody of Awakening Dragon  So you can pick witch dragon is in your hand.  Also for the extra deck I have  Number 97: Draglubion, Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon, Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, Number 100: Numeron Dragon, Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon, Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon added with the Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon and Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon.

The main problem I had when structuring this deck was the fact that I mainly use Burning Abyss monsters as quick little card destruction effects. For example, you can special summon any Burning Abyss monster from your deck if you control no spell/trap cards. However, if you control a monster that isn't a Burning Abyss monster, the Burning Abyss monster on the field that has just been summoned gets destroyed. However, this is where you can activate their effects. My favorite card to use in a non-Burning Abyss deck is <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, because it lets you banish one of your opponent's monsters until the end phase. All the other Burning Abyss cards have similar effects, but there's only a select few that don't use Burning Abyss monsters. Now, when using a deck that is complete Burning Abyss monsters, you will have to wait for your opponent to activate your monster's destruction effect. Is it bad that you will have to sacrifice a couple of monsters to have a chance to get out your extra deck? Yes, but when you do get your boss monsters out, it'll be HELL for your opponent. *<em><span>badum* *crash*</span></em>"

As such, learning the deck comes with a lot of trial and error, so I would suggest importing any rock deck into a simulator and doing test hands until you can relatively consistently end on good boards. A good end board will end on Crystron Halqifibrax (makes Desert Locusts to force your opponent to pitch 1, then you can make any level 10/12 synchro you like, in this deck: Geomathmech Final Sigma), Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and Abyss Dweller (or any r4nk of your choice).  There is a general structure to turns despite there being no combos: <ol>  	<li>Summon as many Adamancipator tuners as possible.</li>  	<li>Use their free +1 effects to get rocks on field.</li>  	<li>Make Admancipator Risen - Raptite and activate its effect to summon another rock.</li>  	<li>Use Admancipator Risen - Raptite and a tuner to make either Adamancipator Risen - Dragite or Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon depending on the current game state.</li>  	<li>Make Crystron Halqifibrax and make more synchros.</li> </ol> If you didn't draw into any tuners, making Gallant Granite to search and summon Adamancipator Researcher is the first priority, after which the turn is usually dependant on excavating good cards.  If you have more money to spend unlike me consider replacing some cards with Infinite Impermenance, Baronne De Fleur, etc"

I MIGHT apply some of the methods i found here to the non-budget version. At the very least though, I'm putting Draco Berserker back into the extra deck in the non-budget version. That card is basically a free once per turn Ash Blossom/Ghost Ogre, plus it gains additional attack after using its effect.  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: I've just bit the bullet and decided to make the low-budget version run the Halqi-combo. The magikeys on their own really aren't strong enough, and this build is still only 100 dollars or so for main deck + side deck. That sounds pretty budget enough, and its still rather playable despite the downgrades. To make up for it, i did lean back into the original build from the mkohl40 video and put in 3 copies of pot of desires. It feels much more in line with the deck it's inspired from while still taking a page from the non-budget build."

There really isn't any first or last step, but I'm gonna try to at least give you guys a sense of what to do.  <span><strong>STEP ONE:</strong></span><span> </span>Hold out for <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> - The cards inside this deck are basically just all effects for protection. You have basically all cards that negate effects, a s@!t ton of mirror forces, and you also have Gaias and Cyber Dragons to get out some synchros using the ""ghost"" cards.  <span><strong>STEP TWO: </strong></span>Once you have acquired <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, get out Dragoon - I'm pretty sure this is self-explanatory  <span><strong>STEP THREE:</strong></span> Win - I mean, it's dragoon. If your opponent actually finds a way to counter it, and at that three of them, your opponent deserves to win.  Of course, there's another way you can play this deck.  <span><strong>STEP ONE:</strong></span> Set/Summon Monsters and protect them with Mirror Force: This is just another way of holding out, but in a different way than you might think.  <span><strong>STEP TWO:</strong></span> Summon <a data-name=""Predeplant Verte Anaconda"">Predeplant Verte Anaconda</a> - Since this is a fusion-based deck, Verte Anaconda is an obvious staple in the deck. Get this out, then send  Red-Eyes Fusion to the grave to use its effect. (To get out Dragoon of course)  <span><strong>STEP THREE:</strong></span> Win - The same thing as the last strategy, your opponent shouldn't be able to counter Dragoon.  Thanks for checking out this deck, and best of luck on your next duel!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The main plays focus on Level 1 Winged Beasts instead of normal Tri-Brigade combos. This,"The main goal of the deck is doing Lyrilusc things with Tr-Brigade as a support. Your main play is trying to get to double Recital Starlings to get two searches since she is not a Hard Once Per Turn (HOPT), then overlay them into Utopic Future to go into Utopic Draco Future. This play ensures your opponent either Nibirus you during this combo, making your plays safer since Nibiru is HOPT, or you have a monster negate that you save for a Nibiru or during the end phase for your Simorgh's Special Summon to go through. Your main combo line is trying to get a Turquoise Warbler and either a Celestine Wagtail or a Cobalt Sparrow, in order to search for a Lyrilusc Spell/Trap or Level 1 WB respectively. Having these two usually guarantees your UDF combo. With the Wagtail, you want to search Bird-Call, unless you already have it, in which case you search Bird Sanctuary for the extra draw or facilitating an OTK. Normally you want to activate Bird Call when you have a Lyrilusc name that you can spare in hand, since the search is great but the extra body on field is amazing. You would normally search for Nervall first if you summoned a Sparrow, or if you went for a Wagtail, search the sparrow with the first Recital. The Wagtail play is usually the more rewarding because after you added the Sparrow, you activate bird call to search for a Sapphire Swallow, then special summon the Sparrow to get the Nervall search. Now you have a Sapphire Swallow and a Nervall in hand to special summon. The rest of the combos after UDF are really up to you, and they are too spread out and different to go into details here, which is why I highly recommend watching Sir Emanon's combo tutorials for this deck, and while our lists are different, he still has great tips, and you may change this list to your preference too! Remember, decks here are merely suggestions. At the end of the day, you're the pilot of your own deck. Good luck duelist!"

There are almost no dead hands and the most consistent Artifact deck there is.  Combo's are simple. Diviner sends Hierarchia. Tribute Herald to get Hierarchia and summon orange from deck to get halq-combo started. Actually you don't need Halqcombo. Just make Librarian during the opponents turn and pop your own backrow so you can get barondefleur. There is also the possibility to play Artifact with Unchained and the new Phoenix Enforcer with Artifacts. But this is another deck for another time.

Kairyu-Shin - Leviathan),"  Here's my first ever Mako Tsunami deck. You know, the ""Freaky Fish Guy"" from Duel Monsters? Well, he got some support that focuses on having Umi on your field, the newest card being Kairyu-Shin - Leviathan. Your goal here is to get Umi on your field and ideally end on Leviathan, Umi, and Physalia. If you can't, your ""Plan B"" is sitting on Bahamut Shark and Toadally Awesome.  So you wanna go first every time. The side deck also runs cards like Warrior of Atlantis and Pot of Prosperity to help with consistency if needed. As for why I have Great White in my deck when 7 Colored Fish has higher ATK, it's because Great White was one of Mako's monsters, so it was thematically appropriate."

Dragoon here is optional and you can remove it for less bricks and 4 free extra deck slots.  Edge Imp Sabres can return your garnets to your deck. But there are a few less-obvious things I'd also like to mention here: if you activate Tour Guide from the Underworld's effect, then you cannot use your Brave Token engine, but I still feel it is smart to run one copy of Tour Guide so that she can be searched off of Small World when you have a brick hand. Speaking of brick hands, Aquamancer of the Sanctuary is a level three, so you can easily use her as material to make Cherubini if you are desperate."

General strategy is to XYZ Summon Prime Photon Dragon using Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon. Detach in battle phase, and double Prime Photon's already massive ATK points. <h3></h3> <h5>Going First:</h5> If going first, XYZ Summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord and Starliege Photon Blast Dragon (Preferably equipped with Photon Orbital, as this will make your board state very hard to deal with)  &nbsp; <h5>General Commentary:</h5> I've been working on this deck list for the better part of 3 years. Play tested against Meta, and seen lots of trial and tribulation. While it's not the best out there, it can certainly hold its own in competitive play.

These synchro monsters can then provide vital disruption and search for other key Swordsoul cards. Due to needing minimal cards to synchro summon, this allows the deck to play many hand-traps to both stop the opponent going second on top of your synchro monsters and allow you to stop them making a huge board turn 1.  The Swordsoul monsters all have the ability to summon a ""Swordsoul Token"" when you eg reveal another Swordsoul in hand, discard another Swordsoul, banish a Swordsoul from your GY etc., and have many cards such as ""Swordsoul of Taia"" and ""Swordsoul Sacred Summit"" to allow the deck to combo consistently post-turn 1 and through hand-traps.  ""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"" synergises with cards such as ""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"" to give you a new Swordsoul monster every turn, whilst also being very easy to summon and generating lots of advantage due to cards such as ""Destiny HERO - Celestial"" who is a draw 2 in the GY next turn.  Weaknesses: floodgates such as ""Summon Limit"" and ""There Can Be Only One"", as the deck needs multiple monsters to synchro summon; ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", however this can be avoided by summoning ""Baronne De Fleur"" with ""Swordsoul Strategist Longyuan"" before summoning 5 times; ""Dimensional Barrier"" as this is a synchro deck.  The deck is relatively easy to play, and I hope you enjoy!"

Control Variant with good enough OTK potential.  This build uses Enforcer as he has a lot of synergy with Ecclesia (adds back in end phase), Supreme Sovereignity (triggers banish eff), is a great extender, can help to draw cards and is very accessible with 3 Fusion Destiny, 3 Pot of Prosperity, Anaconda, Link Spider.  We are not comboing off in this build, we try to avoid Nibiru, avoid Sphere Mode, Lava Golem etc. by committing less summons.  This build uses 8 handtraps: 3 Ash, 3 Imperm, 2 Droll &amp; Lock Birds. Meta Decks want to go first, we need enough hand traps to stop them. Droll &amp; Lock is really good against all meta decks this November 2021 format (Tri Brigade, Lyrilusc, Drytron, Dragonlink, ...).  We use gold sarc as extender (banish blackout to get a token), instant fusion as extender (SS Ansy tuner lvl 4 fusion) or vs. token collector to SS Thousand Eyes to suck him.  We main deck imperial order because we want to go first and even if we get stopped by opponent's hand traps, Imp Order will shut down many decks from OTKing us. We mainly need a Normal Summon to make our strong Synchros.  &nbsp;  We need to keep in mind that Prosperity will not let us draw with Mo Ye, so we should go for Taia, Enforcer, not do the whole swordsoul combo in the prosperity turn.  We should keep in mind that Longyuan does 1200 burn damage, gold sarc will give us the blackout trap after 2 of our standby phases, ecclesia can add back to hand if enforcer was sent to GY, dasher can SS in draw phase, ...  Dragite should always be used to excavate. Maybe our opponent tries to neg it. We could have Nibiru in deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  We play 1 Protos in the side deck, this wyrm is searchable with Grandmaster and the Swordsoul Emergence spell.

This strategy can be somewhat effective even nowadays against a lot of decks, including meta decks, however competitive decks have now a lot of more consistency than the competitive decks back then, not to mention that we didnt had the handtraps/removal/negates we have today. However, back in 2017, this kind of strategy could really win against the meta, even because the banlist had cards like harpies feather duster banned, dark hole at 2, solemn judgement banned, solemn warning at 1, even thunder king rai-0h was at 2 in 2017. The idea is focused into two main strategies: The first one is based on bring zap mustung and thunder king rai-oh with ties of the brethren, and to potentialize the lockdown it uses denko sekka, contract with don thousand and anti-spell fragrance, so basically if you have these 5 cards face up on the field (and your opponent draw a spell card which at that time was very common), your opponent cant search, cant special summon during their turn (until they attack), they cant normal summon/set and they cant set or activate spell/traps (except traps from hand, which at that time the only one who could actually break this lock was evenly matched). And the second strategy is to swarm monsters on the field with pa/ma for xyz summon and gain advantage with the other members of the family. So what do you think about this strategy? Was this viable at 2017? Is this strategy still viable nowadays?"

While I'll admit, Vampire Kingdom sucks, I refused to believe the new support had nothing to help a Vampire Kingdom strategy. So I looked through every vampire card and tried my best to make a deck that could use Vampire Kingdom to its fullest potential (which isn't much). Through my efforts, I found that this deck plays strongest against other zombie decks due to being able to tribute them with sucker, and stealing monsters even with a zombie restrictions. What is listed below is my personal identification of all the cards I chose to use, and their purpose in the deck. After that, I describe the use of basic combos to help you get started. Unfortunately I don't list any 3 card combos since I consider that to be too unlikely to be worth spending time writing down.  &nbsp;  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  <span><strong>Main Deck:</strong></span> <strong><span>(9 Cards) Combo Starters:</span></strong> (3x) Shiranui Solitare (3x) Uni-Zombie (3x) Vampire Ghost Ogre  <strong><span>(14 Cards) Combo Extenders/Pieces:</span></strong> (3x) Vampire Familiar (3x) Vampire Retainer (1x) Vampire Grace (1x) Shadow Vampire (1x) Vampire Duke (1x) Vampire Awakening (1x) Vampire Takeover (2x) Vampire's Domain (1x) Foolish Burial  <strong><span>(2 Cards) Turn 2+ Cards:</span></strong> (1x) Vampire Scarlet Scourge (1x) Vampire Fraulein  <strong><span>(1 Card) Bricks:</span></strong> (1x) Glow-up Bloom  <strong><span>(3 Cards) Vampire Bricks:</span></strong> (2x) Vampire Kingdom (1x) Vampire Voivode  <strong><span>(11 Cards) Tech Card Options: </span></strong>(3x) Vampire Domination (3x) Crossout Designator (2x) Infinite Impermanence (2x) Ash Blossom (1x) Called by the Grave  <span><strong>(15 Cards) Extra Deck:</strong></span>  (1x) Immortal Dragon (1x) Herald of Arc Light (1x) Formula Synchron (1x) Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder (1x) Gaia Dragon, The Thunder Charger (1x) Dhampir Vampire Sheridan (1x) Crimson Knight Vampire Bram (1x) Yuki-Onna, The Absolute Zero Mayakashi (2x) Vampire Fascinator (1x) Vampire Sucker (1x) Avendread Savior (1x) Crystron Halqifibrax (1x) Relinquished Anima  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Side Deck </strong></span>  <span><strong>Vampire</strong><strong> Tech:</strong></span>  (1x) Vampire Vamp (1x) Vampire Sorcerer  <span><strong>Tribute Removal:</strong></span>  (3x) The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere mode (3x) Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju  <span><strong>Monster Negation: </strong></span>  (3x) Dark Ruler No More  (3x) Forbidden Droplet  <span><strong>Monster Removal:</strong></span>  (1x) Corpse Dragon Lord Felgrand  &nbsp;  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Combos:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Vampire Familiar + Vampire Retainer:</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Vampire Familiar</li>  	<li>Link Summon into Relinquished Anima</li>  	<li>Activate Vampire Familiar in grave by discarding Vampire Retainer</li>  	<li>Activate Vampire Familiar on summon to search out Vampire Duke</li>  	<li>Activate Vampire Retainer in Grave by discarding Vampire Duke</li>  	<li>Activate Vampire Retainer on summon to search out Vampire Takeover</li>  	<li>Link Summon into Vampire Fascinator</li>  	<li>Set Vampire Takeover</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Vampire Ghost Ogre + Vampire Familiar/Retainer:</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Vampire Ghost Ogre</li>  	<li>Activate Ghost Ogre's effect discard Vampire Familiar/Retainer, search Vampire Grace, Send Vampire Retainer/Familiar to Grave</li>  	<li>Activate Familiar in grave and send Vampire Grace to the grave to special summon itself</li>  	<li>Activate Familiar's effect on summon to search Shadow Vampire</li>  	<li>Activate Retainer in grave and send Vampire Ghost Ogre to the grave to special summon itself.

This means you cannot special summon from your opponent's grave AT ALL. You Can't use Vampire Fascinator to steal a monster or use Vampire Bram or use Dhampir Vampire Sheridan to steal. This Restriction is ONLY bypassed if your opponent is ALSO playing a zombie deck.  -Vampire Vamp combos best with Vampire Sorcerer for a turn 2 play. Ghost Ogre is capable of one card comboing into Vampire Vamp if you play these 2 cards together.  -Vampire Bram will summon itself back Every Standby phase if its destroyed in any way. Meaning, if your able to attack with another XYZ monster while thats on the field, you can easily make AA-Zeus with it without giving up any powerful XYZ monsters.  -Vampire Bram and shadow vampire's attack disabling effect can be ignored if you use their effects on Main Phase 2.  -Dhampir Vampire can steal a monster that is sent to the graveyard by any card. This can be by battle, or by a card effect or by its own effect.  -Vampire Fraulein + Vampire Domain leaves you with literally no reason to not spend 3000 LP every time a monster attacks. If you get 2 Domains on field, you'll gain an additional 3k LP per attack on monsters.  -In the event you draw 1 of your combo pieces, and you don't have a search target, Just search out Fraulein or Domination instead.  -In the event you open with Vampire Kingdom on turn 1, activate it, then search out Vampire Awakening instead of Takeover, then either: A.  Avoid sending Vampire Duke to the grave to special summon from the deck with awakening. B.  Use awakening to special summon Scarlet Scourge from the deck and use its effect to summon Duke from the grave (to simulate Vampire Takeover's effect).  -Hand traps are really annoying for this deck since a single one can ruin your play, which is why I play so many anti-hand trap cards  -On turn 2, I drop all anti-hand trap andd hand trap cards for board negation cards and kaijus since I don't like running the gamble of ""Maybe I'll draw a hand trap that'll stop their play"". I'd rather have something that can break their board instead. I also drop 2 Vampire Dominations, Crimson Knight Vampire Bram, and Shadow vampire for more board disruption.  -I recommend designing the side deck to your own preference. The only cards I would recommend for the side deck are Vampire Vamp and Vampire Sorcerer.  ======================================================================================================================================================================================  &nbsp;  <span><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong></span>  This deck is the deck I worked the most on out of all my decks (still gets bodied by solemn judgment). I'm proud to have made this and surprised that I was able to make use of most of the vampire archetype (RIP Vampire Lord, if only you were better). Regardless, it's pretty fun to play for me. I also think my decision-making when it comes to tech cards is amateur as heck and I'm sure someone else could pick better cards than the ones I chose. I hope someone who's a better deck builder takes inspiration from my deck to make something better, (so I can take it and play it) and hopefully make people a little more interested in the side of vampires no one cares about. (Even tho vampires just got support, I still wish they got a link monster to search takeover). Thanks for reading, leave a like if you enjoyed using the deck or love vampires, or leave a comment if you have any suggestions."

The side deck is ass ngl, and the extra deck is pretty full so drop whatever you think isn't necessary for combo.

Forbidden droplet since some of the monsters can steal opponent's monsters if they are destroyed by battle. An extra ash ghost banshee and extra zombie worlds in case your opponent is playing a deck that shreads through backrow like butter. Triple Infinite impermeance to have more hand traps. and Finally, the non generic stuff, 1 Extra Jack-o-bolan to help if your normal summon is messed up, 1 Vampire Red baron (this card is super good on turn 2, not so much turn 1), and 1 Utopia beyond to swap out with beatrice or another extra deck monster (I highly doubt any opponent will let you get beatrice's effect off after setting up a turn 1), this monster is good to beat over untargetable monsters while you don't have doomking to carry you.  <span><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</span>  I put way less thought into this deck in comparison to my vampire kingdom deck. Also im writing this at like 12 am. If you have any suggestions, post them below, and if you like the deck, leave a like and lmk you like it by leaving a comment. thanks for reading and enjoy!"

Uses banned cards.,"This abomination is an attempt to make a true Knightmare deck; and when I say ""true"" I mean you have to use every card in the archetype and every support card created with them in mind. I'm gonna be honest, this deck can do some disgusting things as should be expected of banned cards, but it is not competitive in the slightest. There is no room for hand-traps or meta counter utility, we're pretty much stuck with the World Legacy support which are brick more times than not.  I would like to give a tutorial of the combos, but there are so many different ways to play each hand that its kind of impossible to simplify it. I feel that this deck is incomplete and deserves a 60 card variant that can better abuse some of the more niche strategies that can't fit in this 40 card build, but for now here is a  Strategy:  Go first, this deck cannot go second unless your opponent does nothing. The basic idea is to to use your normal summon starters like, Venus, Girsu, Iblee to set up a basic board and use Knightmare Goblin to use a second normal summon and increase your board further. This deck has a few extenders like the World Chalice, Mekk-Knight, Parallel Exceed, Pot of Avarice, used to help link climb. And a lot of in theme World Legacy support cards to act as interruptions.  Your end board will vary greatly and depends on the hand your have drawn. Sometimes you will end on a Knightmare wall immune to targeting, battle, destruction in hopes of unicorn to draw you 4-5 cards your next turn; sometimes you will end on a basic Orcust loop with two negates and an I:P Masquerena; sometimes you'll end with an Avramax with an Iblee on your opponent. There are many more boards, that I will record later.  Test Hands:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/2CFHTKr5cuw"">https://youtu.be/2CFHTKr5cuw</a>  Side Deck  Because I could not fit in every card smoothly, I left them in the side deck as an optional strategy change. Monstrosity ""archetype"" is designed to summon World Gears Theurlogical Demiurgy which is a go second board nuke. Avida Rebuilder of Worlds can also be used to reset your extra deck. A few other World Legacy cards that could use Girsu Krawler combo, or Topological Bomber Dragon board nuke.  I feel bad that I can't give a more in depth analysis, you really just have to experiment with it to figure it out."

And to navigate around the effects of Gravity bind and Level Limit Area B the support monsters to aid you in burning their life points away consistently over time while no monster higher than level 4 can attack. and if in the event your opponent tries to destroy the lockdown cards, make sure to have judgement of Anubis on the field and target Lava Golem with it's secondary effect.  Please feel free to edit this deck and tag this deck for any modifications done to it. OG player from when the game was released and kept up with it until Synchro monsters were released"

You may also use rusty's effect to pop the scythe on your opponent's turn if you summon an xyz to a zone where it points to, namely requiem to get a few negates along with it. This could potentially be budget depending on how El Dorado turns out, but I wouldn't be too hopeful.  Advice and tips would be lovely."

In unrelated news I pulled the new magistus synchro monster in the bode sneak peek which is a secret rare and was temporarily pretty pricy so I’ll be making a celebratory magistus deck soon.  Have a good day!"

It provides synergy with your normal engine while also being able to protect your combo, or help you make a board if you can't establish a Dragon Buster. Could go either way on 1 or 3 Fusion Destiny. It's a nice power play if you get disrupted but it does cost deck space."

It’s been 6 months of testing and trying, but in the end what I have is far better than what I started with, and I am truly pleased (and I think you will be too). I bring you the optimal way, in my opinion, to play:</span> <h2><span>Code Talkers </span></h2> <span>Disclaimers: This deck uses (and relies heavily on) certain OCG cards that have not yet come to the TCG. This deck also doesn’t take into consideration price; I was simply attempting to create the best possible deck I could, not one on a budget.</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 1: Why Play Code Talker?</span></h1> <span>Code Talker isn’t really known for being the strongest Cyberse deck out there; that honor is awarded to Salamangreats. Code Talkers are also overshadowed in the TCG (and OCG) by @Ignister, a good archetype in its own right. So why would you play Code Talker over these “better” archetypes? Well, Code Talker is a mix of both Salamangreat </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>@ignister, especially the way that I would tend to play it. Especially with <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>, Code Talker can play a really strong control option with just contemporary hand traps and its omni-negate <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a>. Typically, the ending setup is Heatsoul w/ Conflict or an Xyz with 2 or more hand traps. The best I’ve come across is Heatsoul + Conflict + Xyz + 3 hand traps, meaning a total of 5 possible negates and either an out for your opponent’s monster effects or GY effects. That, and because of the plethora of hand traps and Cyberse swarm power, Code Talker can even OTK effectively by preventing your opponent’s end board and demolishing them with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> + <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a>. The power of this deck compares with many others; I’ve tested it against meta decks (although I don’t know how effective they were piloted or if they simply got a stroke of bad luck, so that isn’t necessarily an irrefutable measure) and I’ve come out on top a lot, so obviously there’s potential here when the OCG cards come out. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>So now that I have convinced you (or at least got you reading this far), how do you play Code Talkers effectively? Well...</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 2: Strategy + Basic Power Cards</span></h1> &nbsp;  <span>Going first, your primary goal is this: <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a> with as many negates/hand traps as possible. Note that there are a variety of ways to do this; in fact, 10 cards in the deck have the capability of netting you a Heatsoul by themselves: <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a>, <a data-name=""Dotscaper"">Dotscaper</a> and <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>. To get <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a> (your go-to omni-negate), you can either dry draw it or use <a data-name=""Micro Coder"">Micro Coder</a>. If you draw into <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, you can get either <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska"">Number 41: Bagooska</a> or <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> for a strong end board. Your goal is to then survive through your opponent’s turn with minimal damage and return strong with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> to wipe the field and/or Heatsoul/<a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> for attack gain. So how do you do all of this?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>For first turn, if you draw into either Lady Debug, Cyberse Gadget, Dotscaper or Cynet Mining, you have a free Heatsoul (second turn all of these can get you a free Accesscode). Here’s how:</span>  <span>Lady Debug: Normal Summon, add <a data-name=""Code Generator"">Code Generator</a>. Debug + Generator (in hand) into <a data-name=""Code Talker"">Code Talker</a>, mill Dotscaper off Generator’s eff, Special Summoning it. Code Talker and Dot into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Cyberse Gadget: Normal Summon. Link into <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a>, summoning Token. Token + Disciple into <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a>. Mage summon Gadget, link into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Dotscaper: Normal Summon. Link into Link Disciple/<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>, summoning Dotscaper from grave by its own eff. Link Disciple/Almiraj + Dot into Splash Mage. Mage summon Dot, link into Heatsoul.</span>  <span>Cynet Mining: Search any of the above. Note that if you’re worried about <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, search Lady Debug.</span>  <span>(To get Accesscode, simply link into <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> instead of Heatsoul, summoning a Link from grave and then linking into Accesscode.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you don’t run into any of these, no worries! If you have 2 low-level extenders or a low-level hand trap and an extender, you can still get Heatsoul! Link the extenders into Disciple and the hand traps into Almiraj, and you’re good to go from there.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Third turn (and also going second) doesn’t have a specific combo, it’s just getting as much ATK as you can to finish them off.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Now it’s time to go into why I chose some cards over others:</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 3: Why Do You Have </span><i><span>This </span></i><span>One Instead of </span><i><span>That </span></i><span>One?</span></h1> <span>There were a few things that I switched out and plain deleted over the course of optimizing this deck. One thing that any Code Talker player will say when they see this deck is: why is there no <a data-name=""Cynet Codec"">Cynet Codec</a>? And my response is: Codec is strong, sure, but there’s nothing that it can do to make the deck more effective. This deck can already get an Accesscode off of 1 card in hand; not to mention there’s plenty of extenders in this deck. Therefore, the extra power provided by Codec isn’t necessary. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Another thing people may notice: why do I have <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>? Two reasons: Nibiru token and Gadget token. If you need more of an explanation, you haven’t played Yu-Gi-Oh! long enough.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Something else: why do I have 3 of <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>? Because I really want to see it, and it will never be a brick because of how much you Link Summon. There’s really no reason not to.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is in there because not only is it a good hand trap, but it also can negate <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, which can absolutely destroy this deck if you only have Debug (which is uncommon but can happen). You can definitely replace this with another hand trap or with <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>All hand traps can be replaced in the main with others depending on the meta, with two exceptions: Ash Blossom and <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>. Ash for obvious reasons, Phantazmay because that hand fix ability and the protection can absolutely save this deck. I also wouldn’t get rid of Effect Veiler personally, but that’s simply my personal opinion.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> is there instead of <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> because when you have OTK potential, it’s stupid to throw it out the window by having your opponent take 0 damage.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you have any questions for why any of the cards are what they are, just comment on this and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.</span>  &nbsp; <h1><span>Section 4: General Comments</span></h1> <span>If you have <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a> set, make sure not to activate <a data-name=""Lancea"">Lancea</a> until you’ve used it, because Lancea interferes with the second part of it. I believe that you can still negate with Conflict, but it just won’t banish and lock your opponent from using another card of the same name, but I’m not certain.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Proxy Horse"">Proxy Horse</a> and <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> are useful when you have multiple starters in hand. Horse is also the alternative grave send off of Generator. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>There are 12 starters (3 <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Dotscaper"">Dotscaper</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Proxy Horse"">Proxy Horse</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>), 16 hand traps (3 Ash, 3 Veiler, 3 Phantazmay, 2 Lancea, 2 <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a>, 1 Nibiru, 1 Imperm, 1 Reboot), 11 extenders (3 <a data-name=""Micro Coder"">Micro Coder</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Code Generator"">Code Generator</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Code Exporter"">Code Exporter</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Code Radiator"">Code Radiator</a>) and 3 negates (3 <a data-name=""Cynet Conflict"">Cynet Conflict</a>). That’s 42 cards with no draw cards, so you may think that this deck wouldn’t be the best. But it’s still very consistant, with about an 80% chance of seeing a starter, and a higher chance if you include workable hands with 2 extenders or a summonable hand trap and an extender. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>You can probably main 3 <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, since your only monster on the field usually is Heatsoul going first. I don’t like that option, as it messes with your turn 3 strat, but it’ll work and may be more effective in the long run.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is hit hardest by <a data-name=""Psy-framegear Gamma"">Psy-framegear Gamma</a> (on Debug or Splash), <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> (although it can possibly work through it with enough extenders) and any negates with a destruction/banish clause. Cannot play through <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>, <a data-name=""There Can Only Be One"">There Can Only Be One</a> or <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> unless you draw a whole ton of Code extenders. Anything that negates on-field effects and/or graveyard effects destroys any potential for getting a win without spell/trap removal. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Kaijus and other side-deck monsters such as <a data-name=""Prankratops"">Prankratops</a> and <a data-name=""Alpha, King of Beasts"">Alpha, King of Beasts</a> don’t really work with this deck as they mess with Transcode’s requirement. Feel free to try it, but I can say that it probably won’t work.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>As always, feel free to do what you like with it. Any questions can go in the comments, as well as any suggestions for making it better. Thanks!</span>  &nbsp;"

For the start of the combo, you want to summon 1 level 4 rock monster in your hand, special summon Adamancipator Researcher and then use her effect to excavate 5, with that effect you want to summon another level 4 rock monster (If you manage to excavate Prank-Kids Rocksies you can also go for The Prank-kids combo in the deck and then continue). Then you want to XYZ summon into your rank 4 Gallant Granite, use it's effect to add a Adamancipator Seeker to hand from deck, you then want to special summon Adamancipator Seeker from your hand and then using its effect to excavate 5 cards special summoning a level 4 rock monster. With the level 4 rock monster and your Adamancipator seeker you want to Synchro summon into Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, you want to excavate 5 cards again, based on what you excavate you can go to the appropriate steps:  Adamancipator Analyzer/ Doki Doki: If you excavate Adamancipator Analyzer or Doki Doki you can special summon 1 of them then either use Doki Doki effect to discard 1 level 4 rock monster so you can special summon Adamancipator Analyzer, or just summon it with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, then you want to excavate 5 cards summoning a level 4 rock type monster. With that you want to then use Adamancipator Researcher and Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, going into Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Then using Adamancipator Analyzer, and your remaining level 4 rock type monster to go into your Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, after that you would activate Adamancipator Signs bringing back either Adamancipator Researcher or Adamancipator Seeker, then linking into Crystron Halqifibrax with Gallant Granite (or Prank-Kids Doodle-doo if you did the Prank-kids combo with Prank-Kids Rocksies) with Crystron Halqifibrax you want to summon your Plaguespreader Zombie from either your hand or deck, after that going into Baroness de Fleur with Adamancipator Dragite and Plaguespreader Zombie. After that using Plaguespreader Zombie effect to revive self.  A level 4 rock type monster: If you excavate a level 4 rock type monster, you want to then Link Summon into Crystron Halqifibrax with that level 4 rock monster and Adamancipator Researcher, with Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie from hand or deck to field, then Synchro summoning into Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite and Plaguespreader Zombie, After that using Plaguespreader effect in your GY to revive itself.  After you use one of those 2 effects you want to then pass your turn. on the start of your opponent's main phase you want to use Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Formula Synchron. The next move your opponent makes you want to use Formula Synchron's effect, using Scarlight Red Dragon Plaguespreader Zombie, and Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  &nbsp;  While this Combo does limit you to only 1 or not even any negates I would say it is okay as with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity you cannot activate effects in the first place. Even though this combo would seem pretty consistent, it is more of a Fun deck because it easily dies to Dark Ruler no More(at the same time almost every deck dies to DRNM). you can get your King Calamity Tributed with either Sphere Mode or Lava Golem but it is a lingering effect therefore your opponent cannot use his/her effects still.  Hope you enjoy the deck!"

I've found that you only need water extenders after your initial normal summon, along with the rank 4 monsters being bonkers better than linking off into a link 4. Because of that, I took out sleepy maiden for more level 4 extenders.  &nbsp;  I'm also not playing Reef...... but I want to. I'm not sure what the best card in the extra is though. Kragen spawn may be a really good card, but idk. It allows me to have more follow up if my board is broken.  &nbsp;  I'm going to experiment with maiden in the future (probably), along with the other new shark card that comes back from the grave. Crystal shark is the perfect discard for the new link 3, so that may go in over a sea nettle, but it also has the potential of bricking a hand if you don't have another level 5 or 4 that can be left over at the end of your combo.  &nbsp;  Lastly, I've placed wave at 1. 3 is too much, but I can't tell if I want to play 2 when it is so easy to search.  &nbsp;  LMK what y'all think of the deck.

For the start of the combo, you want to summon 1 level 4 rock monster in your hand, special summon Adamancipator Researcher and then use her effect to excavate 5, with that effect you want to summon another level 4 rock monster (If you manage to excavate Prank-Kids Rocksies you can also go for The Prank-kids combo in the deck and then continue). Then you want to XYZ summon into your rank 4 Gallant Granite, use it's effect to add a Adamancipator Seeker to hand from deck, you then want to special summon Adamancipator Seeker from your hand and then using its effect to excavate 5 cards special summoning a level 4 rock monster. With the level 4 rock monster and your Adamancipator seeker you want to Synchro summon into Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, you want to excavate 5 cards again, based on what you excavate you can go to the appropriate steps:  Adamancipator Analyzer/ Doki Doki: If you excavate Adamancipator Analyzer or Doki Doki you can special summon 1 of them then either use Doki Doki effect to discard 1 level 4 rock monster so you can special summon Adamancipator Analyzer, or just summon it with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, then you want to excavate 5 cards summoning a level 4 rock type monster. With that you want to then use Adamancipator Researcher and Adamancipator Risen - Raptite, going into Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Then using Adamancipator Analyzer, and your remaining level 4 rock type monster to go into your Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, after that you would activate Adamancipator Signs bringing back either Adamancipator Researcher or Adamancipator Seeker, then linking into Crystron Halqifibrax with Gallant Granite (or Prank-Kids Doodle-doo if you did the Prank-kids combo with Prank-Kids Rocksies) with Crystron Halqifibrax you want to summon your Plaguespreader Zombie from either your hand or deck, after that going into Baroness de Fleur with Adamancipator Dragite and Plaguespreader Zombie. After that using Plaguespreader Zombie effect to revive self.  A level 4 rock type monster: If you excavate a level 4 rock type monster, you want to then Link Summon into Crystron Halqifibrax with that level 4 rock monster and Adamancipator Researcher, with Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Plaguespreader Zombie from hand or deck to field, then Synchro summoning into Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend with Adamancipator Risen - Raptite and Plaguespreader Zombie, After that using Plaguespreader effect in your GY to revive itself.  After you use one of those 2 effects you want to then pass your turn. on the start of your opponent's main phase you want to use Crystron Halqifibrax effect to summon Formula Synchron. The next move your opponent makes you want to use Formula Synchron's effect, using Scarlight Red Dragon Plaguespreader Zombie, and Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity.  &nbsp;  While this Combo does limit you to only 1 or not even any negates I would say it is okay as with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity you cannot activate effects in the first place. Even though this combo would seem pretty consistent, it is more of a Fun deck because it easily dies to Dark Ruler no More(at the same time almost every deck dies to DRNM). you can get your King Calamity Tributed with either Sphere Mode or Lava Golem but it is a lingering effect therefore your opponent cannot use his/her effects still.

(This was due to its last effect, which allowed you to add all of the Adamancipator Tuners, which I agree, is pretty broken.) With the loss of such a powerful defensive utility, Rock Decks were forced to take a new approach that they have been quite good at recently: <em>Beatdown.</em></span>  <strong><span>Best Beatdown Rock Archetypes as of 2021</span></strong>  <span>First of, one of the most significant Rock Archetypes <em>ever</em> would have to be Adamancipators. The Tuners synergize very well with all Rocks, and they can quickly make heavy Synchros such as <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> (mainly the first two, as you have to work a bit for Crystal Wing). (Not to mention it can also function as a Stun Deck if it is integrated with Koa'ki Meiru.) Another significant Rock Archetype that has recently been introduced would be the Fossil Archetype, which is the literal embodiment of beatdown. Being able to Fusion Summon with materials from either Graveyard is excellent (not to mention the rewards you get for using materials from your opponent's Graveyard), and the ace Fusion Monsters are all Battle Phase oriented (the best one being <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a>). The last Rock Archetype that has had some considerable support in 2021 would be Magnet Warriors. Although Magnet Warriors are lacking in removal options, they specialize in mediocre swarming (literally every card in the archetype, except the original 3 Normal Monsters, has an effect to Special Summon something), and while the archetype itself does not explicitly reward the player for getting 5 Level 4 monsters on your opponent's turn, it does open up itself as an engine for other Rock Decks (mainly the aforementioned two). And with the release of the new <a data-name=""Epsilon The Magnet Warrior"">Epsilon The Magnet Warrior</a> (OCG), Magnet Warriors are a very strong going first Archetype due to their somewhat untouchability during the opponent's turn, even without access to <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>.</span>  <span><strong>So... we should start talking about this Deck then</strong></span>  <span>This is an Adamancipator/Fossil Beatdown Deck that uses Magnet Warriors as its main engine (wow, how original) for Synchro material and Fusion Material. The Deck is somewhat balanced in terms of its in-game adaptability, 1) being able to open a strong going first board with Magnet Warriors that gives you a full field and Graveyard set-up on your next turn or 2) being able to establish stable footing for itself going second with Adamancipators and Fossils (since your opponent's Graveyard is most likely already established). Do note that the Deck is very swarm heavy, and because of this it is unfortunately very dependent on careful zone usage and placement (the Link era still leaves its tracks in the mud lol).</span>  <strong><span>Win Condition</span></strong>  <span>The best possible field that could be established with this Deck would be having <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> as your main disruptor, <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Convoy"">Fossil Machine Skull Convoy</a> (to get through walls of big monsters and get that <em>residual damage</em>) or <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a> (it's essentially Blue-Eyes Chaos Max just without the protection), a <a data-name=""Gorgonic Guardian"">Gorgonic Guardian</a> or two (I shouldn't have to explain this), and <a data-name=""Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior"">Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior</a> since it punishes your opponent if they happen to bomb your entire field all at once. (It wouldn't hurt to have a <a data-name=""Magnetic Field"">Magnetic Field</a> out too, but it's a shame it's not SEARCHABLE.)</span>  <span>However, if you want to tie up a match quickly, a funny way to game end is with <a data-name=""Fossil Dragon Skullgios"">Fossil Dragon Skullgios</a> and <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> (but that's only if you want to be <em>extra cheeky</em>).</span>"

This deck can play through a bit of hand traps it may not get through a whole hand loop but usually their going to have an abyss dweller which counters some certain decks. Gishkis can have a lot of draw power and get resources really nicely kinda gets somewhat countered if you use something that locks the grave which hurts but it really depends on your hand. I play a bit of impcantation, but overall hieratics with gishkis sync well when your playing atlantean stuff."

The various synchros can be summoned with Halq or with Deskbot 001, Halq goes into Shooting Riser, whose level is easily manipulatable since we have main deck monsters from 3-5, letting SRD be anywhere from Lv 2-4 for synchro summoning. The Symphonic Warriors and Ice Knights give us extra normal summons so we can save our pendulum summon for reusing our pedulums after they get set to the extra deck, and Hamster and Pendulum XYZ let us get a little extra value out of being a pendulum deck.  Brachion makes us want to go second, and our boss monsters either shred boards (Trish, Trish-Zero) or are powerful negates (Toad, Borrelload Savage,) or both (Infinity, Fleur), so we canuse that and our hand traps to fight through an established board.  Just like in 2017, Dinomists are a cheap, mediocre engine that gets to play a wide variety of powerful but expensive boss monsters."

""<b>Salamangreat</b>""  is an archetype of FIRE Cyberse monsters  The ""Salmangreat"" monsters have various effects related to battle and <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">GY</a> recursion. A common theme among many of their monsters is they work best when with another monster of the same name. The most simple and powerful example is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Gazelle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a>"" who sends any ""Salamangreat"" card from the Deck to the GY, and can also Special Summon itself from the hand if a ""Salamangreat"" monster is sent to the GY. Many of the archetype's effects also involve shuffling cards from the GY into the Deck, revival and discarding cards, so manipulation of the GY successfully gives the Deck a lot of potential.  A key part of the Deck's combos is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a>"", which allows the player to use a ""Salamangreat"" with the same name as a monster being Link Summoned as the entire material. As with the lesser monsters, the boss monsters get stronger when Summoned using a monster with the same name, making ""Sanctuary"" the quickest and easiest way to open up the full potential of the Deck's Link monsters. It can be searched by ""<a title=""Salamangreat Balelynx"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Balelynx"">Salamangreat Balelynx</a>"" to increase consistency, which makes generic Cyberse monsters like ""<a title=""Lady Debug"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Debug"">Lady Debug</a>"" and ""<a title=""Flame Bufferlo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>"" useful to start combos off.  The main win condition in some builds is to set up a ""<a title=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Violet_Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a>"" Summoned using another copy of itself, which basically guarantees an <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""OTK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/OTK"">OTK</a> if all its effects resolve. The other Extra Deck monsters can be used to support this strategy, or for supporting the Deck's recursion/battle effects. In more conventional builds, ""Violet Chimera"" can simply used with ""<a title=""Fusion of Fire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"">Fusion of Fire</a>"" and ""<a title=""Super Polymerization"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" to break up Link-focused boards, particularly deadly in <a title=""Mirror Match"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mirror_Match"">mirror matches</a>. The Deck's rarely used Ritual Monster ""<a title=""Salamangreat Emerald Eagle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Emerald_Eagle"">Salamangreat Emerald Eagle</a>"" provides a finisher/alternate attacker that can clear all the opponent's Special Summoned monsters if Ritual Summoned using an ""Emerald Eagle"" the player controls, and can sacrifice unneeded Link Monsters to get over tough monsters while inflicting heavy <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Burn"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burn"">Burn</a> damage.  As any modern Deck must, the Spell/Trap lineup of the Deck also has a heavy control element. ""<a title=""Salamangreat Roar"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a>"" is a powerful <a title=""Counter Trap Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Counter_Trap_Card"">Counter Trap Card</a> that can negate any monster effect or Spell/Trap card while you control a ""Salamangreat"" Link Monster, that can Set itself from the GY when a ""Salamangreat"" is self-Link Summoned at the cost of banishing itself when it leaves the field. It can also be recovered by ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a>"", who can also play a key role in grabbing ""<a title=""Fusion of Fire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"">Fusion of Fire</a>"" or other key Spell/Trap cards from the GY, especially ones sent by ""Gazelle"". Many of these like ""<a title=""Will of the Salamangreat"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Will_of_the_Salamangreat"">Will of the Salamangreat</a>"", ""<a title=""Salamangreat Circle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a>"" and ""<a title=""Salamangreat Rage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Rage"">Salamangreat Rage</a>"" get stronger when a self-Summoned Salamangreat Link Monster is present, so maintaining and protecting a powerful monster like ""<a title=""Salamangreat Heatleo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a>"" can reap many rewards, even over a relatively short Duel. ""Sunlight Wolf"" can also recover FIRE monsters from the GY, particularly useful with the staple handtrap ""<a title=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_Blossom_%26_Joyous_Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"". These attributes of repeated recursion allow the Deck to get a lot of value from playing many on-theme 1-ofs, as they will nearly always be accessible when needed.  Finally, a key step in setting up these plays is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a>"", a generic Rank 3 that can Summon any ""Salamangreat"" from the Deck and <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Bounce"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Bounce"">bounce</a> opposing cards on being used as Link Material (Traditional only). An alternative to ""Miragestallio"" is ""<a title=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dante,_Traveler_of_the_Burning_Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>"". As such the Deck works well with generic Rank 3 <a title=""Engine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Engine"">engines</a> such as ""<a title=""Speedroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Speedroid"">Speedroids</a>"", ""<a title=""Danger!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!"">Danger!</a>"" and ""<a title=""Predaplant"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Predaplant"">Predaplants</a>""."

Where the goal is to corrupt your monsters and turn them into mindless drones! We come in peace... or do we...  &nbsp;  The idea behind this deck is to flood the field with ""A"" counters by using <strong><a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a> </strong>so you can take over your opponents' monsters and use them as fodder for your summons. By sending an Alien monster from the deck to the GY you can place counters on an opponent's monster up to the level of the sent monster. The main strategy is to quickly summon Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll and use both of his effects.  &nbsp;  In order to do that, we need to flood the field with Aliens. In order to do that, we need to bring out <strong><a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>. </strong>The effect of M-Frame allows you to distribute ""A"" counters to monsters face up on the field, however you wish. The great thing about this effect is that it specifically says distribute. Meaning you can bypass non-targeting effects, which is a pretty awesome deal.  &nbsp;  From there you can special summon Alien monsters from your GY up to the number of monster's your opponent controls with ""A"" counters. Bring out another Alien from your grave, to then Link Summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</strong></a>. When he is out on the field, monsters with ""A"" counters are switched to defense position and cannot change their position (so long as there are counters on them) also they can no longer activate their effects. That's not all, <strong>Zer'oll</strong> also gives us the ability to add a card that can place ""A"" counters. From here you can pull any number of cards that add ""A"" counters, but this strategy will revolve around adding <strong><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a> </strong>to your hand. Then, using <strong>Zer'oll's</strong> effect, remove 2 ""A"" counters from anywhere on the field to Normal Summon the Kid. Once <strong>Alien Kid</strong> is summoned, any monster your opponent special summons will have an ""A"" counter placed on them. Effectively preventing your opponent from activating effects or declaring an attack.  &nbsp;  I have included a small Reptilianne engine for extenders as well as their Synchro <strong>Reptilianne Melusine</strong>.

The deck can output a BSD provided you open well enough. If you don't like the Phantom Knight engine you can opt for a Simorgh, Apex Avian, Cyber Dragon Infinity Package.

When playing a Neos deck, be prepared to activate <a data-name=""Neos Fusion"">Neos Fusion</a>, having 7 options to choose from, then defaulting to 2 of them.  <a data-name=""Rainbow Neos"">Rainbow Neos</a> is an incredibly versatile card to help even the playing field with your opponent. You'll want to go into him if your opponent has a field of monsters that you're not gonna be able to deal with, or a lot of backrow. If neither are the case, shuffling back their GY is costless and never hurts.  <a data-name=""Neos Kluger"">Neos Kluger</a> can swing for massive amounts of damage and deal a lot of burn. If you equip Kluger with <a data-name=""Favorite HERO"">Favorite HERO</a>, you'll have a 6000 ATK beat-stick that burns your opponent for large amounts of damage. Since his burn effect is not OPT, you can use the second attack with Favorite HERO to hit in a second time to close the game. Favorite HERO is also the reason why we run a single copy of Neo Space.  Sadly the other Neos Fusions aren't in the same league.  Starting with the two-piece fusions, <a data-name=""Air Neos"">Air Neos</a> used to be the biggest beat-stick, but is more often than not outclassed by Kluger. <a data-name=""Dark Neos"">Dark Neos</a> can negate monster effects, but hits the field after most of the ones you'd want to negate are taken care of. <a data-name=""Grand Neos"">Grand Neos</a> spins a monster back, but so does Rainbow Neos. <a data-name=""Aqua Neo"">Aqua Neo</a>s is probably the best of these with his hand ripping effect, but is held back by it being random. <a data-name=""Brave Neos"">Brave Neos</a> searches for either Miracle Contact or Neos Fusion when he destroys a monster, which is a decent effect but is too slow.  The triple/quad contact fusions are pretty great, but are a pain to summon. <a data-name=""Cosmo Neo"">Cosmo Neo</a>s drains all your resources, but if you have lethal it ensures that nothing will stop you. <a data-name=""Nebula Neos"">Nebula Neos</a> gives you some much needed draw power and negation. <a data-name=""Storm Neos"">Storm Neos</a> clears the backrow... (so does Rainbow Neos lol). All of these cards clear the field when they go home to visit grandma during the end phase.  This is usually not helpful during your end phase, and while it can be good during your opponents end phase with Neos Fusion's GY effect, you have to think about what you are possibly gonna do during your next turn after losing everything. Just pray you don't draw into any of the Neo Spacian's you shuffled back.  <a data-name=""Fusion Dispatch"">Fusion Dispatch</a> summons any of your Neo Spacians/Neos/Yubel from the Deck and helps a lot for contact fusing the larger monsters. <a data-name=""NEXT"">NEXT</a> is potentially a great card, but Neo Spacians and Neos rarely hang out in the GY. <a data-name=""Miracle Contact"">Miracle Contact</a> keeps this deck somewhat playable. I wish <a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a> didn't have the ""control no monsters"" restriction, but is otherwise your only draw power. <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>/<a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>/<a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> are good for going 2nd (BTW good luck if you have to go first, you're gonna need it).  Don't think too hard about the Link monsters. <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> is basically the only one that matters. I honestly couldn't think of what else to put.  Feel free to add in <a data-name=""Neos Wiseman"">Neos Wiseman</a> if you really want to float into him with Kluger, personally I didn't bother considering the massive amount of bricks Neos has to put up with already. While you're at it, go ahead and swap out the spare Grand Mole's, Dark Panther's, and link monsters for a copy of Flare Scarab, Glow Moss, and their fusions you absolute madman.

To alleviate this weakness, where others see fit to play Crossout, which does go well into the deck, since it can fit a whole bunch of handtraps, I preferred to go with the option that probably won't cost me well over a hundred dollars and use a lot of WATER level 4 extenders to go into Bahamut Shark (who doesn't just represent an omninegate, but is also a free water body) by the 4th summon, with the added bonus of being decent at playing through interruptions other than handtraps when going second and helping you end on some of the strongest disruptive rank 4s in the game, like Kragen, Abyss Dweller or Toadally Awesome.  Access to Stealth Kragen, particularly, can put this deck over the top, since it's sort of a boneless Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, having a quick, non-targetting pop every turn and being able to float into itself while getting your resources back through Kragen Spawn, which you can attach Toad to from the GY.  Foolish Burial Goods lets you send Ice Barrier to grab either one of your best extenders, Abyss Shark, or Gameciel to break boards (you can bounce Gameciel with Argonaut btw, it's really funny when it happens). Additionally, you can sometimes also send Fury of Kairyu-Shin to dodge stuff like DPE, or a Marincess backrow to add back with Rock/Anemone, which usually only comes up after you eat an Ash on Sea Angel.  &nbsp;  Some rationalizations for changes I've made over other marincess builds and the previous versions of this deck:  Mandarin isn't here because I've tried to lab plenty of combos using her, but I've only found that she helps you with making Argonaut unaffected through the field in some pretty specific hands and she isn't a very good card to draw. The setup she requires means she's pretty bad for extending after your combo gets interrupted too.  Sleepy Maiden being level 5 and therefore not normal summonable or able to go into the link-1s or the Xyzs makes her kind of bad and testing the deck in real games has led me to believe the combos where you send her with Tang and use her effect to equip Anemone to Argonaut without needing the field aren't optimal most of the time, so I dropped her.  I run 3 Pascalus because she helps a lot with making rank 4s while doing the Marincess stuff and a lot of people just shotgun imperm/veiler on her, which rarely does much of anything. She also gets you back Wave, Dive or Ocean, if it got destroyed, back to your hand turn 3 to go for the kill which is pretty good.  I don't run Accesscode because almost every one of your really good cards locks you into water monsters and Argonaut ends up accomplishing pretty much the exact same thing while being easier to make, but I don't think it's necessarily wrong to run it if you can find space in your extra for it and Transcode."

Either Mayakashi, Shiranui, or Zombie World.","Depending on your opening hand, you have three different ways that this deck can play out. This makes the deck varied in its plays and versatile in its response to threats. But in return for this, the deck is less consistent in getting any of its three strategies started. The ideal hand is one in which you can do your whole Mayakashi Synchro climb and send Necroworld Banshee to the grave with Yuki-Musume to activate Zombie World. This sets up your graveyard for future plays and forces your opponent to work around Zombie World. In the case that you do not open with a way to do your Synchro climb, the other starting cards you are looking for are Shiranui Squire, Shiranui Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, or Jack-o-Bolan. Shiranui Squire is an immediate Synchro Summon into Squiresaga which allows you to then banish Squire to fix your hand and fill your graveyard. Shiranui Solitaire allows you to go into a large number of cards depending on what else you have in hand. You can get out Dakki if you have Yuki-Musume in hand and continue with Mayakashi plays, or you can get out Uni-Zombie and set up for future turns. Uni-Zombie allows you to fill your graveyard with cards that can help accelerate your future plays and turns. And then Jack-o-Bolan is a fun card that can get a key card into your graveyard and allows you to interact with your opponent on their turn. The Zombie World and Rivalry of Warlords is always a fun lock to put up and is the only reason this deck can go up against meta decks. Swallow Slash is a better Icarus attack that can get rid of three things if you banish Shiranui Spiritmaster with its effect. And as a finisher, you have Sunsaga which resets the board and refills your Extra Deck. The easiest way to get out Sunsaga is with Balerdroch and Spectralsword, and can be done with both cards on the field, or with both cards in the graveyard. Overall, this is a very fun Zombie Deck that allows you to grind pretty hard once you get all the pieces in place, but loses if your starter gets negated or if your Graveyard gets banished to death."

Small World came out and is a thing, right?  &nbsp;  One of the biggest issues I've had with the deck over the past few months are those hands where you open unplayable. I've tried just about everything to help minimize those hands, but nothing really helped without losing just about every hand trap spot. Even then, I still bricked more often than I would like.  &nbsp;  But small world is a thing now! This means that any machine or veiler in hand can turn into a dozer, metalcruncher, fortress, or bullet train (or anything other than harvester), and as and bell can turn into bullet train or harvester.

This is a prerelease deck so it is subject to change, but with the field spell, fusion spell and main monster Albaz, it can allow you to put out fusion monsters rather quickly and pull cards from the deck in order to get a fusion so long as the deck is prepaired to do so. this is a basic template, so cards can be changed out to meet user needs."

Our goal is to summon Nekomusume as soon as possible (by Ghostrick Festival or dig the deck with Siren or Allure and then special summon her by Ghostrick Shot or Ghostrick Fairy) and then search for Ghostrick Night (either by Ghostrick Stein or Ghostrick Siren or Ghostrick Angel of Mischief). After that, you can search for Vanish or Scare for your second and third trap. At this point, you probably have 80% win chance. Zeus is for plan B when you have too many Lv1 monsters or you just want to wipe the field. Goodluck and have fun!"

Marincess has strong potential finally. Lets talk about the cards here.  Marincess Wave is not once per turn...and can be activated from hand multiple times!!! Goal number one is to have 2 waves in hand.  Tuner game is still pretty good. I can arboria as an extender into halqifibrax. Then halqifibrax can actually go into locust to handloop 1 and then go into baronne. Nice option and variety for casual but can be displaced by handtraps as needed.  Frog engine just works in any water most of the time...  New link 4 is a backrow negate. How many backrow you plan to negate? 1 right? then its all you need plus the waves is awesome.  &nbsp;

This deck's advantage is playing through handtraps(except D-shifter). This deck is also very good at going second with board breakers like breaksword, unicorn, and arc-rebellion. This decklist brought me first at a 45 man back to duel tourney which consisted of tri-brigade, drytron, ect. I feel as if this deck will be meta going into this format and is a deck with a kick. This list could be altered to fit more extenders or more handtraps depending on how you would like to play."

A Level 1 Tuner for Odd Level Synchros  3x Dimension Shifter: Chengyin Buffer, almost impossible to play around Handtrap (use during OPP's Draw Phase to dodge Gamma and Triple Tac)  &nbsp;  Spells/Traps (17 Spells, 2 Traps):  &nbsp;  3x Swordsoul Emergence: NAH, THIS IS THE HOLY SWORD ""EXCALIBUR.""  1-2x Swordsoul Sacred Summit: You only need one since it's mostly an OTK/Floodgate Deck, You may want to look into 2 or more for doubles tho.  3x Vessel for the Dragon Cycle: Triple ROTA/FOOLISH BURIAL. Say ""No Mas."" You get the ROTA effect when you link into Tenyi Shaman.  3x Pot of Desires: I think Prosperity is Preferred.. But this deck already $$$, this is good too tho because you get tons of recursion and buffs.  1x Called By the Grave: Hand-Traps? Watertho0o0ose.  3x Dark Ruler No More: OCG MUST, for us tho, idunno bro.  2-3x Triple Tac: Probably best card in our Group RN. You can swap them out for other stuff tho.  2x: Swordsoul Blackout: Double Pop, Also level 4 Tuner Token. If you pop Chengyin, you can use his effect to protect and still double pop.  0x Swordsoul Assessment: I don't really think you need this, it's an honest. I'd Probably only use it if you have a hard time outing Dragoon.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  &nbsp;  2x Swordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao: Good for Banish Fueling, Imperm/Veiler Disruption Effect  1x Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying: Boss Monster, 100 atk/def per banished, Banish effect, Hard to remove  2x Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing: Non-Destruction Removal, GY Recursion  1x Baronne de Fleur: Yeah. This Card's Busted. 'Nuff Said.  1x Cyber Slash Harpie Lady: OCG likes to run it for spells that have prerequisite Monsters (Flex Pick)  1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing: Light/Dark Protection from Hand-Traps  1x Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen: Macro Cosmos (Monster Vers.)  1x Crimson Blader: Really good against our Meta, Prevents Lvl 5+ from being summoned. UCT? Virtual World? Dragoon? Eldich? Cyber Who?  1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi: Non-Targeting Banish (DRAGOON?), Also Fat Beat-stick, probably stronger than Sovereign Chengyin.  1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing: Extender. Disruption, I think every card in this deck is somehow a disruption tho.  1x Adamancipator Risen - Dragite: This card is so good, 5 Card deck peek, and Omni-Negate if you summoned using Mo Ye.  1-2x Monk of the Tenyi: Extender for any Tenyi monster, Because their effects can be used in HAND OR GRAVE (""O3O"").  &nbsp;  Side Deck:  &nbsp;  1x Archnemeses Protos: 20$ Target Attribute Dark Hole + Floodgate. It's good, but can you afford it? $_$  3x Nibiru, the Primal Being: Always Good.  1x Dinowrestler Pankratops: Highly Rec in this deck, Even used in the OCG here.  3x Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay: Vs Link Decks, Sky Striker, Phantom Knights, Six Sam (1st Ogre/Nib, 2nd Droll Better tho), Arcana Knight, Sometimes CD.  3x Artifact Lancea: Good against Most decks, PK, Dinos, Eldlich.  1x Droll &amp; Lock Bird: Guess not too popular in OCG  2x Twin Twisters/Cosmic Cyclone: Very Popular in OCG  1x Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju: For the Unexpected.  &nbsp;  Alternative Extra Deck cards:  &nbsp;  1x Swordsoul Catastrophe - Qixing Longyuan: Not out yet BUT BROKEN, HAS ALL OF THE ABOVE SS EFFECTS!!  1x Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons: Uhmmm, you actually can't summon it with any of the cards I mentioned.. But it's cool.  1x Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons: Lil' Bro of Beelzeus, But I still don't know how you get them out, OCG uses them often, I think you use Synchron Resonator?  1-2x Colossal Fighter: Versus Warrior Decks, This guy is a Beast. (Phantom Knights, Infernobles, HEROES, Six Samurai ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Poggers.)  1x Black Rose Dragon: OCG Favorite, But not as in Duos. Flex it if you want :^)  1x Geomathmech Final Sigma: This Card is unbeatable!! (Except by Cyber Dragon Chimeratechs)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Once Synchro Summoned, he starts out with a total of 2400 ATK and two Spell Counters which will allow him to destroy two cards on your opponent's side of the field right off the bat. It's an unlimited trigger effect so you activate it any time during your turn to destroy as many cards equal to the amount of Spell Counters you have on him (or on the <strong>Magical Citadel of Endymion</strong> Field Spell).  Here is the main combo which can be done on your very first turn simply by having Assault Sentinel: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Assault Sentinel</strong> and use its effect to tribute itself to special summon <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> from your deck.</li>  	<li>Once Psi-Reflector is special summoned, you can use its effect to grab the<strong> Assault Mode</strong> trap card from your deck to your hand.</li>  	<li>Activate Psi-Reflector's second effect to reveal Assault Mode in your hand, special summon Assault Sentinel from your graveyard, and raise it's Level by 2 to make it Level 6 (because Arcanite Magician is Level 7).</li>  	<li>Activate Assault Sentinel's second effect to reveal <strong>Arcanite Magician</strong> from your Extra Deck to turn Assault Sentinel into a Spellcaster type.</li>  	<li>Now that Assault Sentinel has converted into a Spellcaster-type monster, this will allow you to ultimately Synchro Summon Arcanite Magician from your Extra Deck by tributing Psi-Reflector and Assault Sentinel.</li>  	<li>With Assault Mode still in your hand, you can simply set it and activate it during your opponent's turn to tribute Arcanite Magician and special summon <strong>Arcanite Magician/Assault Mode</strong>, which you will most likely do if you've already used up the two Spell Counters to destroy things, leaving him vulnerable at 400 ATK. You can also wait until your opponent targets Arcanite Magician with a Spell / Trap or during battle before activating Assault Mode.</li> </ol> If you happen to start off with Psi-Reflector in your hand, or is the only card you manage to have on-hand, you can still do the same exact combo except you'd have to discard <strong>Assault Beast</strong> instead. This will allow you to use Psi-Reflector's second effect to special summon Assault Beast from the graveyard in which they can both be used to special summon <strong>Assault Beast Ally of Justice Catastor </strong>from the Extra Deck. You can also use <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> to get Assault Sentinel into the Graveyard if you only have Psi-Reflector in-hand which will still allow you to get Arcanite Magician out.  If you're getting overwhelmed by monsters and / or really need to get rid of a specific monster, you can easily Synchro Summon into <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> with Psi-Reflector and any Assault Mode monster (by raising the Levels of Assault Sentinel or Assault Beast by 3 Levels) if necessary.  <strong>Emergency Teleport</strong> just acts as a fourth Psi-Reflector in the deck. I only run one since you only need one Psi-Reflector out to get things going. But you can feel free to run multiples if you'd like.  <strong>One for One </strong>is basically the fifth Psi-Reflector, as it's the only monster this card can be used with. You really want to try to get a Psi-Reflector in your hand as soon as possible.  <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> is only there specifically to special summon <strong>Musician King</strong> from the Extra Deck, in which then he can be used to special summon <strong>Supreme Arcanite Magician</strong> or other Link Monsters depending on the situation.  The Pendulum Monsters; <strong>Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</strong>, <strong>Magical Abductor</strong>, <strong>Magister of Endyimion,</strong> <strong>Mythical Beast Jackal King,</strong> and <strong>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</strong>, are just support engines I decided to run with to build up tons of Spell Counters for Arcanite Magician. You can actually overpower your opponent quickly with just the Pendulum Monsters and <strong>Apprentice Magician </strong>alone if you can't manage to draw out Psi-Reflector in time. If you happen to pull out Arcanite Magician late-game, you'd have about twenty Spell Counters to go nuts with by then.  I'm still constantly tweaking the deck and currently changing around the ratios of the Pendulum Monsters and Pendulum Monster selection but so far this is what's playing more smoothly than all my previous builds when I'd first started it.  Feel free to throw out any recommendations as I've just gotten back into this game recently. I'm not really trying to go for a meta / tournament build as I just wanted to play something fun, but I'm still open to those suggestions anyway."

This is facilitated by their Field Spell, ""<a title=""War Rock Mountain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Mountain"">War Rock Mountain</a>"", which can search a ""War Rock"" monster on activation and Summon a ""War Rock"" monster from the hand at the start of the Battle Phase while also protecting a ""War Rock"" from being destroyed by battle.  Alongside this, most members of the archetype includes an effect in order to Summon themselves or another ""War Rock""/Warrior monster to the field under certain conditions; usually related to battling, destruction, or leaving the field by an opponent's card effect.

Mill a bunch of cards 2. Banish some Thunder Dragons 3. Win games,"<span><strong>Some Background:</strong></span>  While looking for a new deck to play, I came across the idea of Lightsworn Thunders. However, a search for lists to base inspiration upon was fruitless. So, I pulled a Thanos, and said: ""Fine, I'll do it myself.""  At first, I came up with a Lightsworn heavy 60-card list, but that was bricky and inconsistent. Then, I developed a 60-card Lightsworn light list, which was fine, but not my style. So, I managed to create this 40-card Ligthsworn heavy list.  <span><strong>The Gameplan:</strong></span>  So, the general things that I noticed while playing this deck are: <ol>  	<li>This deck can either go first or second, so winning the die roll doesn't matter</li>  	<li>This deck is speedy</li> </ol> <strong>Going First:</strong> You're going to want to end on Titan and Apollousa. Usually this is accomplished by somehow getting Thunder Dragondark's effect off, adding Thunder Dragon Fusion, summoning Thunder Dragon Titan, and then using the leftovers to summon Apollousa. If you still have stuff leftover, you can make an I:P.  <strong>Going Second:</strong>  Same thing, but use Titan to break boards and kick *ss, then Borrelsword to O<strong>TK.</strong>  <strong>FAQ:  </strong>Q: Why not more Levianeers? A: For one, it's searchable by Chaos Space; for two, it's a brick if you don't open ways to mill a Roar or a Dark  Q: Where is Hawk &gt;:(((((((((((((((  );&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A: Hawk is bad &gt;:(  Q: Where is Valk?  A: Valk is bad &gt;:(  Q: Where is Verte? A: I:P is cheaper  Foolish, Gold Sarc, and Instant were cut in order to make room for 40"

Overall, its really good.  return: 3 - its (effectivly) 3 extra copies of gmg, thats all that matters  traptrick: 3 - its also (effectivly) 3 extra copies of gmg, thats all that matters  main deck 2 of's:  glow-up bloom: 2 - this is a level 1 tuner and a way to spec summon balerdoch or jack-o bolan (mostly balerdoch). you can easily make a link 2 zombie with just this card by summoning linkuriboh off of it.  balerdoch: 2 - its a level 8 body that can summon itself from the graveyard to draw off of sucker, be recurred as material for a i:p play and is a negate.  jack-o bolan: 2 - can special summon itself from the hand and can set up the graveyard with the discard, if needed it can draw you cards off of sucker as well.  Danger package:  danger nessie: 2 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies  danger jackalope: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies  danger tsuchinoko: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies  danger mothman: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies  main deck 1 of's:  terraforming: 1 - its another copy of zombie world  foolish: 1 - its graveyard setup  one for one: 1 - graveyard setup and a way to get glow up bloom  banshee: 1 - another, easier way to get zombie world  gozuki: 1 - the worst of the nomal summon package but still good, if needed, you can send it for its second effect allowing you to continue combo's.  extra deck:  yuki onna link 4: 2 - a decent end monster, you can use yuki-onna link 3 to trigger a negate, as well as i:p sending a card with a when sent to the gy effect  yuki onna link 3: 2 -can be summoned off of I:P to get a negate, other than that is mainly just a cheap way to trigger gmg  vamp sucker: 2 - can draw you extra cards during your turn, or let you draw during your opponents.  avendread: 1 - can send cards but is mainly just a battle focused zombie link  halqi: 1 - the key to your combo's, can summon glow up bloom from the deck leading to easy combo's leading to your boss monsters, can also be used to summon locust for a discard and (if you control a level 4) a baronne during your opponents turn.  I:P: 1 - can summon yuki onna link 3 from the extra deck for negate  linkuriboh: 1 - is a way to get glow up bloom from the field to the gy  desert locust: 1 - is there to be a possible summon off of halqi, causes your opponent to discard cards and can summon baronne  red-eyes zombie: 1 - is a battle syncro that can revive, is only really in here to end games if you can do it normally  omega: 1 - can take banished blooms and mezuki's and put them back in the gy, as well as taking a card from our opponent's hand.  barronne: 1 - is here to be summoned from locust, can negate, destroy and revive.  big eye: 1 - idk he's just here for if we have spare jack-o's and nessies, not really important but idk what else to add"

Next is the Extra Deck Rikka's, First is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Rikka Queen Strenna</a> which is how we recycle our Rikka S/T and when tributed can ""rank-up"" into the other 2 if needed, Then we have <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a> that protects our monsters by tributing a plant monster in hand or field if they would be destroyed and can also act as Monster Reborn when a card has been tributed, Lastly is <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> who is our main boss monster and 1 of our main disruption tools, her first effect lets us Tribute our opponents monsters at SS2 and the second effect booster her by 200atk every time a card(s) is tributed.  <strong>Aroma: </strong>Aroma since November 2021 had one of its main build arounds <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram banned but the deck still has a strong toolbox and drident-like removal with Teardrop the Rikka Queen. To replace her we've opted to play Aroma Gardening, Dried winds and 1 extra copy of Blessed Winds. This should make the Aroma engine still powerful just less consistent than previous builds where the goal was to turbo Sweet as fast as possible.</a>  <strong>Predaplant:</strong> This give us more disruption with predaplanning, strong fusion boss monsters and access to Super Polymerization one of the strongest board breaking cards in the game. This engine really helps solidify our mid game and keep our opponent off of big boss monsters.  <strong>Traps:</strong> Our trap line-up is simple, Disrupt as much as possible. The rest are pure advantage cards that further push our greedy mid-late game.  &nbsp;  <span><em><strong>Openers</strong></em></span>  Our deck isn't that dependent on getting a starter but knowing what your options are is important. Here are the most common openers for the deck.  <strong>Petal into Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and activate its effect to search <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a>, summon Mudan by tributing Petal and Activate Mudan to search Either <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> for disruption or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> for value. This is our standard opener and what we will typically do against most decks.  <strong>Jasmine/Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> in the Centre Column and send <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> to summon 2 Tokens, Link both Tokens into <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and activate its effect tributing <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> to summon <a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</a> and search either Petal to get the Rikka engine started or <a data-name=""Rose girl"">Rose Girl</a> if your engine is already going.  <strong>Set 4 Pass: </strong>This is probably the 2nd most common opener in this deck but not necessarily a brick, as long as we can continually disrupt the opponent they will eventually have the same ceiling for power that we currently do, which is exactly what we want because we have inevitability in that once we draw our engine cards we can easily start out advantaging our opponent and win from there.  &nbsp;  <span><em><strong>Midgame</strong></em></span>  &nbsp;  Midgame is tricky because its extremely dependent on what your opponent is doing and what you have access to but generally at this point you should be deciding how many turns you can realistically close the game out in and how you are going to accomplish it. Here are some things to look out for in the midgame.  <strong>Abusing Blessed Winds: </strong><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> is one of your key cards in the mid game. Making sure you are using each effect to its fullest potential is important.  Keeping your engine's going with the first of effect is crucial to get into a winning position, shuffling back your Rikka cards ensures you have the fuel to keep grinding out your opponent. Dodging removal with the 2nd effect is probably the single most important thing to keep in mind at all times, remember we only have 1 <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and no way to recover it, if it's banished we are suddenly cut off from one of our main engines. The 3rd effect is a great value tool that lets us keep a strong board presence and re-use strong effects like Aromage Marjoram or Aromaseraphy Jasmine.  <strong>Predaplant's: </strong>Midgame is where predaplants start becoming more relevant, <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> can keep our opponent off of XYZ's and Synchro's while <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can act as unconventional removal. Predaplant Verte Anaconda also spikes in the midgame turning any 2 monsters into Super Polymerization which can be game winning on it's own.  <strong>Establishing Bosses: </strong>In the midgame we really want to summon our boss monsters like <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen or <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Benghalancer the Resurgent. While summoning Benghalancer can be difficult it can easily be game winning in the right board state so always look for for opportunity's to summon it.</span></a>  <strong>The Advantage Trinity: </strong>This is the point in the game where your secondary advantage engines start kicking in, <a data-name=""Card of Safe Return"">Card of Safe Return</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Factory Of More Production"">Dark Factory Of More Production</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, These cards give us immense card draw and let us draw into our powerful trap cards in order to keep disrupting our opponent.  <strong>Making the most of our traps: </strong>Traps are our main way of controlling the pace of the game and defending ourselves from big pushes from the opponent, knowing when and how to use your traps is matchup dependent but there are some fundamental's you can apply to any matchup. <ul>  	<li>Always keep your opponent's summon limit in mind when choosing when to use your disruption.</li>  	<li>Is the card worth removing? If the card is easily removed in battle refrain from using your removal too early and save it for a bigger threat.</li>  	<li>Am I on a clock? A clock refers to the amount of turns your opponent can lethal you from, if you feel like your opponent is trying to race you down then you can be more loose with your removal cards.</li>  	<li>How much has my opponent committed to a play? The more value you can get from each of your removal cards the better, shotguning your <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> too early might leave you with less value than if you had waited.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><em><strong>Late Game</strong></em></span>  <strong>Ending the game: </strong>By this point we should have enough board presence to close the game out with our boss monsters, always keep cards like <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite! and</a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!""> </a><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy in mind when trying to close out games.</a>  <strong>Don't get too greedy: </strong>Ensure your plays are all trying to close out the game, don't keep playing for value as you may get punished by a top-deck from your opponent.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></span>  &nbsp;  Plants are an extremely fun and rewarding deck to learn and has a ton of deckbuilding options beyond just this list. Its grind game potential and flexible toolbox make it great into any meta with the right tech-cards and solid fundamentals."

This non-meta deck focuses on the past strategy of Clownblade, where you can spam XYZ Rank 4s. OTK is possible on any t","SHOW THEM THE POWER OF UTOPIA!  This non-meta deck focuses on the past strategy of Clownblade, where you can spam XYZ Rank 4s. However, with the times' progressing signs, there are also options to fusion and link summon while going against Top Tier Meta. Personally, it got me either on or very near the top 100 leaderboards on a popular online simulator website for Yu-Gi-Oh! (For the latest Yu-Gi-Oh! game Master Duel: I went from bronze 5 to platinum 3 with this deck in less than a few days). So I know this deck packs a powerful punch if you know what you are doing on certain moves. I'm a firm believer that rogue non-meta decks can not only compete on their own but also thrive on destroying meta decks to keep your opponent guessing. <ul>  	<li>It would help if you preferred to go second because:</li> </ul> 1.) Most effect monsters in this deck have the effect of ""If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can special summon this card.""  2.) You can One-Turn-Kill (OTK) with the ""Number 39: Utopia Double"" strategy. Minimum: You get a boosted 10,000 ATK or higher ""Number 39: Utopia"") by attacking into an opponent's attack mode monster, if and only if the opponent's monster has 2000 attack points or less (10000 ATK utopia minus 2000 ATK monster equals 8000 damage). It means you won when your opponent had 8000 life points or less. Utopia has some support cards in this deck to give other power boosts, protection, and other fun shenanigans. You can power up Utopia and get different variants of him on the field. <ul>  	<li>The Clownblade Performage Engine includes cards such as ""Performage Trick Clown,"" ""Performage Damage Juggler,"" and ""Performage Hat Tricker."" The Clownblade engine alone provides Level 4 monsters to spam, block any battle damage from opponent attacks, and block any burn effect damage.</li>  	<li>There are Utopia support cards.</li>  	<li>All other cards are tech and staples.</li>  	<li>Side deck punishes spamming or specific game mechanics.</li>  	<li>Some cards are in the deck for fun (Such as using the Melodious cards).</li> </ul> 1. ) For example, you can use the fusion spell card, ""Ostinato,"" to special summon ""Schuberta the Melodious Maestra."" By the effect of ""Ostinato,"" that monster gets destroyed by the End Phase. Then you special summon ""Aria the Melodious Diva"" and ""Elegy the Melodious Diva"" from your Deck.  Above is a formidable defensive board lock where your Melodious monsters<em> cannot be targeted and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects</em>. There are few options to beat this board lock move. Your opponent can <em>send (without targeting)</em> those cards to the graveyard or banish zone, <em>not targeting</em> with card effects, such as ""Super Polymerization,"" <em>tributing with the Kaiju monsters archetype</em>, or <em>negating all card effects on the field</em>, such as ""Skill Drain.""  ""Ostinato"" uses cards from deck or hand. You can send more fodder Melodious cards to the graveyard to make the entire deck more consistent to make other moves without using Melodious cards. <ul>  	<li>Another fun thing is to run ""Neos Fusion"" to disrupt the field. Rainbow Neos works very well with the Utopia OTK.</li>  	<li>Some other cards are situational, such as field spells and other spells/traps. This deck composes of spellcasters, fairies, and warriors.</li>  	<li>You can XYZ, link, fusion, and synchro summon.</li>  	<li>You can XYZ summon ""Number 59: Crooked Cook"" (A monster whose monster effect states: While you control no other cards on the field, this card is unaffected by other cards' effects). Combine this XYZ monster with XYZ materials such as ""Astral Kuriboh"" or ""Right-Hand Shark,"" you can make a monster who is unaffected by anything and cannot be destroyed by battle (The only outs for ""Number 59: Crooked Cook"" are Kaiju-like monsters, piercing damage-effect monsters, having your opponent attack your life points directly, or prevent its summon in the first place).</li>  	<li>You can still run it for Master Rule 4 or Master Rule 5.</li>  	<li>You can run it for Master Duel.</li> </ul> Remember, if you believe in the heart of the cards, and you need a deck that can fit almost all situations, you should try out the deck. It's fun and competitive!"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Floowandereeze"" is a combination of ""wander"" and ""breeze"", with an additional ""Floo"" added to the front to approximate the archetype's Japanese name (while also being reminiscent of the English word ""flew""). The original Japanese name's first part instead comes from the Japanese word fuwafuwa (""fluffy"").  Link tutorial for this deck :  https://youtube.com/watch?v=QGGACtZmGzs"

Play Flawless Perfection and Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi as support possibly getting a Gagagigo the Risen or a Blue-Eyes Ultimate (if Barrier Statue or Gozen has been blown up) when Fists gets blown up.  Keep summoning monsters. Maybe summon an XYZ monster if the board gets too big. Abyss Dweller is pretty good for making sure the lv8s can beat over things AND has a good stall ability (assuming Skill Drain isn't around). Snow-dust giant will also help make the water monsters seem bigger. Use ancient rules to summon the lv8s.  Heart of the Underdog will hopefully maintain card advantage.

You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  <span>You will soon basically understand the concept of which cards you might ever use during the set up once you finally figure out how the Charmer's strategy works. Do the rest which I already listed of all the cards that might be used for the final board set up at the below.</span>  ___________________________________________  <strong>[End Board]</strong> • <em>Field:</em> - <a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a> - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + {<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> = <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Magicians</a>} (Opponent's Turn) • <em>Spell/Trap:</em> - <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (face-up) - <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> (set) = <a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> (Opponent's Turn) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)(Equipped by ""<a data-name=""Borreload Salvage Dragon"">Borreload Salvage Dragon</a>"" effect) • <em>Hand:</em> - 1 Draw (Your turn) - Extra Draw (During your Opponent's Turn) - Added: <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a> (During your Opponent's Turn)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  Since Lyna &amp; Dharc familiar monsters haven’t been revealed yet in TCG. I came up with those ideas by adding “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” from the Deck to gain more consistency. I didn't actually plan to add them on my Deck in the first place since I want to prove that this Deck can win without relying on any Limited cards. <span> I might actually replace the “<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>” and “<a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>” including the “<a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>” later once the Light and Dark familiar’s monster has been finally released in TCG. By replacing it with two copies of “<a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>” Field Spell card and one “<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>” Spell card.</span>  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a>k” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster."

If you're tired of making the exact same soulsword or drytro,"Despia is an archetype of dark fairy and light fusion fiend monsters that focus on fusion summoning. The archetype was initially released in dawn of majesty but didn't see much competitive success. However recent support in Burst of Destiny and changes to the surrounding meta game make this deck poised to be a powerful threat in the upcoming season. While there are many variations that can be done on the archetype, such as combining it with darklords for potential big boards and aliester for better fusion targets, this variation of mine combines despia with a shaddoll and predaplant package for going second and breaking boards. Let me go through some of the key cards.  Aluber, the Jester of Despia: This card is your main normal summon. He can search out either the field spell that fusion summons, or either of the quick play spells that can be used for offense or recovery. He also has a GY effect when a fusion is destroyed but since his effects are once per turn, once that turn, it doesn't come up much.  Despian Tragedy: This card is low-key amazing. Because his search effect triggers on either banish or sent to the GY by card effect, he can trigger off being fusion summoned, banished for allure, or sent by the quick play spells. His GY effect to reset a branded spell is also extremally useful.  Dramaturge and Libitum: these 2 Level 8 monsters are in the deck for extension plays when used as fusion material. They can be quite useful to go into dingirsu when you need to remove a problematic card.  Despia, Theater of the Branded: The deck doesn't die without the field spell up but it is easily much stronger when it is up. Obviously it fusion summons but the more interesting effect is when your non-fusion fairy(despia monsters are fairys) leaves the field by card effect or battle, you get to summon back a fusion monster from the GY. This turns so useful against something like nibiiru or a board wipe, since chances are you had both a fusion and a despia on field so it will trigger.  Branded Opening: This card is really good. It locks you into fusion monsters after usage but it puts a body on board or in hand, its discard is not a cost so it will trigger both tragedy and any of the shaddolls, and while in the GY it can protect a fusion by card destruction. all around a good card.  Shaddoll package: The shaddoll choices can vary and while they are not necessarily garnets, you don't want to see too many in your hand without a despia in there too. The only shaddoll monster you can(or rather want to) make with the field spell is construct and unless you side in some nibiru or effect veiler, you will have to rely on either your fusion monsters or your opponents light monsters. But Shaddoll fusion is still and amazing card and triggers basically any effect you want it too. Schism can be a great way to close out games by making winda as well.  Predaplant package: this is honestly a cuttable part of the deck. The reason I included it is monstly just cause its another way to make fusions, it is another super poly target, and its an allure banish at worst. If I can find something more powerful and consistent I will gladly swap it out.  EXTRA DECK:  Masquerade the Blazing Dragon: This is one of the new cards and frankly its amazing. Against heavy combo decks, even just one of these on the field means your opponent has just 13 card activations before they need to deal with it. which may sound like a lot but you would be surprised how many card activations it takes before a deck can get a pop or negation live. And since you're going second, this is both a super poly target and if you can't beat your opponent, you can still lower their life enough that they might have only 2, 1, or even 0 card activations left. Also its level 8 so another material for Dingirsu.  Despian Quarteris: This card is for cleaning up boards that don't have a dragoon or Phoenix enforce on them(that's what super poly is for), and floats into jester, which if the field spell is up will float into despian. A nice card all around.  Despian Proskenion: While a despia monster, a light, and a dark monster sound like a lot of material for a fusion, I can think of 2 decks whose end boards tend to have on them a light and dark( looking at you soulsword and drytron). Honestly, nothing feels better than summoning a jester, activating super poly to send away someone's herald of ultimentness and dragoon, then bring back their dragoon with Proskenions effect and win that way.  &nbsp;  GENERAL GAMEPLAN: Your typical game plan is to blind second. Let your opponent set up and use bait cards like Opening and allure to bait interaction before blowing them away with your power cards of shaddoll fusion and super poly. If your opponent goes first, thats generally fine as masqurade or Quarteris can generally keep you alive with their floating and recusion, or if you open decent end on a winda. As noted earlier, Drytron and soulsword can get regularly hosed by this decks power cards, so your side deck should consist of counters to backrow heavy decks(which your only counter here is dragon and dingirsu) and specifically flunderezz(since that deck doesn't use the extra, isn't weak to superpoly, and doesnt special summon)"

It can bring a copy of itself from the GY to the hand, so it's good at combo-ing with Astolfo.  Sublimation Knight - Sublimation Knight is one of the best cards in this deck, since when it's summoned, it can let you bring out a free Isolde thanks to good synergy with Squeaknight. If it isn't in your starting hand, you can use Isolde's second effect to discard 3 Equips from the deck to summon out Sublimation Knight and continue your link plays.  Squeaknight - Squeaknight is almost solely here to combo with Sublimation Knight, but it also lets you bring out some syncrho monsters if you ever want to.  Infernoble Knight Renaud - Renaud is an amazing card, being a free special summon in almost any hand an can also return an equip spell from the GY, which is situationally useful.  Infernoble Knight Astolfo - Astolfo combos well with Isolde and Red Layer, being able to use the card they add to summon itself. It is also a combo piece with DDR, being a neat tech combo.  Boost Warrior - Boost Warrior is something you can use your normal summon on, or you can summon it if you have a special summoned Squeaknight on your field.  Fire Flint Lady - This card is a free special summon as long as you have any fire warrior on the field, which is easy for this deck. It can also be used to bring out Red Layer or Sublimation for extending Synchro plays."

Snake Rain gets your combos going: Pitch any card, send Nunu, Nauya, Zohah, and a Keurse. Special summon nunu since you have no monsters, tribute it to Keurse, then summon Nauya. Nauya searches for your Lily, which you use to send you Aleirtt. Normal summon Zohah after you put it into your hand by dumping a card using his effect, and XYZ Nauya and it off for rikka queen. This is what I love about the deck: Rikka is your 5th summon, and since Nibiru tributes, you will still get the negate. Activate Aleirtt's effect to get rid of Rikka (If you haven't been Nibirued) and then use Queen's effect to summon your negate. If you are going first, take Keurse and Aleirtt, to XYZ summon for either Number 38 or 97. 97 will still get you into your Harbinger, but it is an extra body on the field.  If you are going second, take the above combo, but do not go into harbinger, go into Draglubion who then will summon an 18K attack Numeron Dragon.  Sadly this combo is pretty fragile, one Ash CAN and WILL make you probably lose the game, but if it is Ashed, go with this combo if you have it:  Nunu Combo: Pitch Nunu to send Zohah, Dump a card to add Zohah to hand. Special Summon Nunu, Normal summon Zohah to XYZ into you King Of The Feral Imps. King searches for Nauya, then Nauya pitches for Keurse. Tribute your King Of The Feral Imps for Keurse, and summon Nauya. Nauya searches for your Lily, and Lily sends Aleirtt. Then it just becomes your basic snake rain combo at this point.  There are other combos that this deck can do, with the reptilianne cards, but this is an Ogdoadic deck, after all  &nbsp;  Other cards you may consider: Borreload Savage Dragon. In testing this card, it does get me out of rough spots, I would probably replace your Ahashima for this. Borreload or Borrelsword are also good cards. Also replace Ahashima with these.

Even when faced with something that can effectively disrupt them, pendulum magicians can be surprisingly resilient with a decent hand, typically able to play through 1 or 2 interruptions without much difficulty. Their biggest weakness is consistency, due to the inherent fact that pendulum decks need at least 2 pendulum scales and a few monsters in hand to make any significant plays. They are somewhat prone to brick hands that can only make 1-2 interruptions and get stopped by 1 hand trap. Nevertheless, they are definitely strong enough to pick up a win at locals as long as you can draw well and dodge Anti-Spell Fragrance.  <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>  3 Harmonizing Magician: Harmonizing gives you a free material for an extra deck monster just for pendulum summoning it. You want to go out of your way to set this up above any of your other plays except maybe popping a Double Iris. Just remember it can’t be pendulum summoned from the extra deck  3 Double Iris Magician: The pendulumgraphs are really good cards with StarGraph offering combo extension and recovery and TimeGraph being one of the strongest spell speed 2 destruction effects of all time. Double Iris is a searcher for them that is very searchable itself due to being a magician as well as being treated as a pendulum dragon for Duelist alliance. Don’t forget that it can pop itself if you control a dark spellcaster if you don’t have another way to do it. Also it’s not once per turn.  3 Wisdom-Eye Magician: Wisdom-Eye’s pendulum effect that pops itself to put another magician in your scales is highly appreciated consistency and it can be pendulum summoned afterwards to directly generate card advantage. Also it’s not once per turn.  2 Oafdragon Magician: Oaf is the best low-scale magician because its pendulum effect is a free +1 that isn’t that isn’t hard at all to activate. Also Konami actually remembered to keep this one to a HOPT.  2 Performapal Skullcrobat Joker: Joker is pendulum monster Stratos, it makes the deck consistent enough to be playable and when it inevitably goes to 3 on the next banlist you add in the last copy.  2 Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer: Unfortunately, not a magician monster, but its effect on summon is a +1 at worst and it is also the best way to pop Double Iris. It can also be used as a low scale in a pinch.  1 Performapal Celestial Magician: This one is played more for what it is than what it does. Both of it’s effects are pretty niche but it is the only monster that is both a pendulum magician and a performapal (not including Five-Rainbow Magician because that card was never intended to be played in actual pendulum decks). This makes it searchable off Pendulum Sorcerer if all you need is another magician.  3 Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer: The dracoslayers are an incredibly splashable engine for a million different pendulum decks. Luster’s pendulum effect is a free +1 and the dracoslayer extra deck monsters give pendulum decks a lot of extra utility and card advantage for only a Luster and some level 4 pendulum monsters on board. Also it’s not once per turn.  1 Tuning Magician: Halqifibrax target. Because of Selene, you can make your rank-4 play without using Tuning Magician’s effect so if you have magicians in your scales you get a free extra deck material afterward.  3 Effect Veiler: Veiler is the most synergetic hand trap for pend magicians because it is a tuner and spellcaster monster so it can be used to make Selene and Halqifibrax.  3 Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring: Any tuner hand trap works because of Halq and Ash is the most flexible one.  3 Duelist Alliance: ROTA for pendulums. You can search Luster, Pendulum Sorcerer, Pendulum Treasure to get any pendulum monster, and even Double Iris because it is a pendulum dragon.  3 Pendulum Treasure: The other ROTA for pendulums. Note that Harmonizing can’t be summoned from the extra deck so you will want to have an Oaf available to put it into your hand if you need to search it with Treasure.  1 Called By the Grave: Pend magicians are decently resistant to hand traps but your brickier hands can still be ruined by an ash and running one-of Called By means that you can occasionally sack your opponent when you should’ve been shut down.  3 Pot of Prosperity: Out of the 15 cards in the extra deck only 12-13 of them are needed. Prosperity lets you banish your worst 3 extra deck monsters to improve your consistency, which is something that pendulum decks struggle with.  1 Star Pendulumgraph: StarGraph the worse of the pendulumgraphs but still worth playing because 1 search per turn is strong and pulling off 2 Double Iris pops in a game is something the deck does just by working correctly.  1 Time Pendulumgraph: This is the reason to place such a high value on Double Iris. It’s a spell speed 2 pop every turn, but what makes it overpowered is the “Then, if this card didn’t destroy 2 cards, DIngirsu effect” clause that makes the pop impossible to avoid, gets around almost all protection, and has no reason to exist.  1 Treacherous Trap Hole: For Rafflesia.  1 Gravedigger’s Trap Hole: For Rafflesia.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  1 Abyss Dweller: Dweller is a generic floodgate monster that locks the entire current meta out of at least half their deck. You would be stupid not to play it.  1 Traptrix Rafflesia: Rafflesia is the only XYZ boss monster that is sometimes worth making over Dweller. Either a spell speed 2 double pop or a monster negate. Because most of your plays happen in the spell and trap zones, making this before or as your 5th summon is trivially easy, so you are effectively Nibiru-proof as long as you don’t draw Gravedigger’s.  1 Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer: Majester, Ignister, and Dinoster are a simple combo with each other if you have Luster and any 2 level 4 pendulum monsters on board with at least 1 being non-tuner. Synchro luster and a level 4 into Ignister, Ignister ef summon another Luster from deck, then you can use Ignister ef to pop a scale and spin a card without targeting, XYZ Luster and a level 4 into Majester, Majester effect to search a pendulum in the end phase, Majester ef detach a material to summon Luster from extra deck, contact fuse Majester and Luster into Dinoster, Dinoster ef summon Luster from grave. It turns a few monsters with no effects on field into a search in end phase, a non-targeting spin and scale pop, and scale protection. That isn’t much, but it’s practically free because it only requires some monsters that get replaced with the same number of better monsters.  1 Linkuriboh: Linkuriboh  lets you link off your Tuning magician for your Halq combos so that you can go into Avramax and get another attribute in grave for Accesscode.  1 I:P Masquerena: Masq does a lot of things for this deck. Generic materials, 2 down arrows for pendulum summoning, and it’s an interruption because it can go into Knightmare Unicorn on your opponent’s turn.  1 GranSolfachord Musecia: There are some cases where you want to make this when link climbing to swap a Wisdom-Eye for an extender or a Joker for next turn. It’s very specific and not all that good so this is almost always banished to Prosperity.  1 Knightmare Phoenix: I had some free space in the extra deck so I threw in a Phoenix. It’s nice to have so that you can get rid of floodgates with any 2 random monsters.  1 Crystron Halqifibrax: Up the link ladder we go! Summon Tuning Magician, link it and Halq into Selene, Selene ef summon Tuning Magician, link Tuning Magician into Linkuriboh, link Selene and Linkuriboh into Accesscode or Avramax.  1 Selene, the Queen of Master Magicians: The only thing Selene does is facilitate Halq being a 1 card link-4.  1 Knightmare Unicorn: Spin away anything annoying you for 3 monsters and a discard. Unless they are immune to targeting, in which case you need to go the extra mile for Ignister Prominence or TimeGraph.  1 Accesscode Talker: This is what all the link climbing is for, pop your opponent’s entire board and beat them to death.  1 Crusadia Mekk-Knight Avramax: This is the other thing you link climb into, make a huge untargetable beat stick that protects the rest of your board and spins your opponent’s best card if they manage to deal with it.  1 Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: You don’t get your pendulum monsters back into the extra deck if you use them as XYZ materials, so going into 4 material Apollo is a fine alternative to Rafflesia or Dweller if you have no other plays to make or you want to avoid topdecking for Joker on your follow up turn.  1 Ignister Prominence, the Burning Dracoslayer: See Majester Paladin, the ascending Dracoslayer. Ignister is pretty good on it’s own as well because it can pop a scale for a non-targeting spin while also summoning a Luster from deck to continue your plays.  1 Dinoster Power, the Mighty Dracoslayer: See Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer.’’  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Combos</strong></span>  Pend magicians don’t really have specific 2 or 3 card combos, they’re more about figuring out how to turn 3 or 4 random combo cards in your hand into the same kinds of end boards. Playing every hand optimally takes a little bit of practice, but here are some general things to think about:  The main cards you are looking to use are Harmonizing, Double Iris, Luster Pendulum, and Pendulum Sorcerer.  Try to work in something that will give you a follow-up play, whether that is a search from Joker or Majester, set pendulum scales, or something else like an Oaf effect.  Use Wisdom-Eye whenever possible, it’s free advantage and not HOPT.  Link climbing isn’t very good going first. You would rather make Apollousa, I:P, or some XYZ monsters.  Popping Double Iris is very annoying to do without Luster Pendulum or Pendulum Sorcerer."

""Artorigus, King of the Noble Knights"" and ""Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn"" are support-like cards but your key-card to show off with this deck is ""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"".  &nbsp;  The rest of the extra-deck ist changeable. You can use any kind of rank 4 - or link - cards. I would not recommend to use more Synchrocards, because you only have one tuner but playtest as much as you want to.

Spell/Trap, 1 Ecclesia, 1 True Draco monster, the other 1 don't matter what it is, but the good one is Nadir Servant.  <strong>2nd Turn</strong> : 1 Cont.

This deck also has a lot of backrow removal, so don't worry.  But I'm not sure if this is good enough compared to other control decks, so I'd be happy if you guys give me some advice to make this deck better.  I emptied the side deck so you can fill anything.

The deck also requires the integration of the ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon (archetype)"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon_(archetype)"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" archetype for it to reach its maximum potential. ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon Core"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon_Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>"" can search ""Cybernetic Horizon"" and other ""<a title=""Cyber"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber"">Cyber</a>"" Spell/Traps. ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon Herz"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon_Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a>"" can activate its effect if sent to the GY by ""Horizon"" and provide further consistency.

""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" can be Summoned by using copies of the ""Cyber Dragon"" monsters and has immense OTK potential, especially if Summoned with the help of ""Power Bond"" and ""Cyberdark Chimera"". ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon_Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>"" adds further OTK potential to this Deck by increasing the ATK of any Machine monster with 2100 or more ATK by another 2100, thus including the ""Cyberdark"" Machine monster with sufficiently strong Equip Cards. <h4><span id=""Equip_options"" class=""mw-headline"">Equip options</span></h4> ""<a title=""Attachment Cybern"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Attachment_Cybern"">Attachment Cybern</a>"" is the ideal Equip Card for the original 3 ""Cyberdark"" monsters, as it grants them total of 3000 ATK if equipped by their effects.

""<a title=""Leng Ling"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Leng_Ling"">Leng Ling</a>"", while having only 1500 ATK, will also set the ATK of any ""Cyberdark"" it is equipped to at 2500 ATK and allow it to attack twice, and it can summon itself to the field while equipped. ""Cannon"", ""Claw"" and ""<a title=""Autorokket Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Autorokket_Dragon"">Autorokket Dragon</a>"" are second to ""Hunter Dragon"" in terms of original ATK, with 1600 ATK each. ""<a title=""Masked Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Masked_Dragon"">Masked Dragon</a>"" is both an eligible target for the Level 4 ""Cyberdark"" monsters and can search most other eligible targets. ""<a title=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Baby_Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>"" can add a Level 1 Dragon monster from the Deck to the hand when sent to the Graveyard while equipped to a monster.  ""<a title=""Cyberdark Invasion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyberdark_Invasion"">Cyberdark Invasion</a>"" and ""Cyberdark Realm"" also expand the scope of cards ""Cyberdark"" monsters can be equipped with. ""<a title=""Cyber End Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_End_Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>"" can also be sent from the Extra Deck to the GY with ""Cybernetic Horizon"" and serve as an Equip Card for ""Cyberdarkness Dragon"", increasing its ATK up to 6000, or enable the Summon of the Deck's ultimate ace monster: ""Cyberdark End Dragon""  High-<a title=""Level"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Level"">Level</a> <a title=""Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dragon"">Dragon</a> monsters are usually kept to a minimum, as most of them do not contribute to the main strategy, tend to <a title=""Brick"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Brick"">brick</a>, and can only be <a title=""Equip"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Equip"">equipped</a> to ""<a title=""Cyberdark Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyberdark_Dragon"">Cyberdark Dragon</a>"", ""<a title=""Cyberdarkness Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyberdarkness_Dragon"">Cyberdarkness Dragon</a>"" or ""<a title=""Cyberdark End Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyberdark_End_Dragon"">Cyberdark End Dragon</a>"", the latter two of which are also not limited to Dragon monsters for equipping, so a mere ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" can provide them enough relevant <a title=""ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/ATK"">ATK</a> boost.

","Welcome to my version of Floowandereeze Dogmatika.  Floow is an incredibily strong strategy when it goes off, but sometimes really struggles to get past interrupts, which requires a lot of cards that can impact the core strategy due to the increased chance of bricking. It can also really struggle with it's going second game because of the resilience of other meta strategies to intteruption. This Dogmatika build somewhat alleviates the consistency issues, as well as add cards that can board break increasing the chances of being able to play. It also further increases the odds of dealing with the mirror match going 2nd (as long as Shifter isn't dropped.)  The 4 Tribute monsters consist of 2 Empen, 1 Raiza and 1 Apex. I chose these ratios purely because should i lose one Empen to the graveyard, I can always search another without having to resort to Strich/Toucan/Raiza to bring it back into play against most of the meta decks. Having 2 really helps when playing against Lyrussic Tri-Brigade which can play around Barrier Statue, as you can continue to prevent them playing the links, as well prevent them the XYZ's from using their protection effects when trying to attack directly, making them easy prey for cards like Raiza, Punishment and Book Of Moon. Some Floow decks don't use Avian, but combining it with unknown winds and it's looping negation can really eat through your opponents cards, so it's more than worth it.  The deck uses a really standard Floow setup of 3 Robina/Eglen, 2 Strich and 1 Toucan. I really like Strich at 2, as not only is it useful for recycling Empen and the spell/traps but becomes a looping DD Crow, banishing cards from your opponents grave every single turn.  The Dogmatika package of 3 Nadir, 1 Ecclesia and 2 Punishment is the ratio i like best. Nadir can act as Ash bait, but also can dump Omen/Barren Blossom into the grave, allowing a free winged beast search or hand fix, depending on the situation. 2 Punishment to increase the chances of drawing one copy in case i get interrupted and at least get something to use.  Dark Ruler No More was added because the deck doesn't run handtraps in the main and is instead opting for a board breaker approach when going second, things like DPE, Dragoon are fairly painful to get around otherwise. Pot of prosperity is used in the Dogmatika build (I play extravagance in the pure build though) because the extra deck is more utilised in this build. Book Of Moon is temporarily here until Journey Preparations  comes in, but fulfills the role of avoid imperm/veiler in the mean time, as well as being a potent weapon if set when going first.  The side deck rather shockingly has uses, although mostly as Nadir/Punishment targets and banishes for prosperity. N'tss because it really helps to break boards, Barren Blossom/Omen as mentioned before can be dropped with Nadir to further dig into the deck and get what i need. Dragon Master Knight if i need to get rid of something particularly large Punishment. Nightingale, Downerd and Zeus can be utilised if you need to completely board clear, though it rarely happens the option is there.  I've relagted Shifter to side, just like I have in my current Gren Maju build (see my drck uploads if this interests you). It's useless in the mirror, interferes with  Dogmatika and only really affects the Tenyi portion of Swordsoul builds, and while this means the actual swordsoul plays are more vulnerable, me not running handtraps means I cannot take advantage of this, plus a lot of the time they'll still power through anyway. However it outrights shuts off every other deck in the meta. Droll for the mirror match and gets swapped right in with Shifter when going second against most decks. Lightning Storm to destroy backrow against the mirror and other Trap heavy decks, Macro for more banish. Appointer to stop anything likely to interfere with my board and 2 Evenly Matched to round of the Side.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

A key component in your fusion plays</span>  <span>3x Incredible Ecclesia the Virtuous - Summons albaz from deck from a free special summon so you can use your normal summon on something else</span>  <span>2x Albion the Shrouded Dragon - Can dump the needed branded spells or albaz directly from the deck to the GY</span>  <span>3x Aluber the Jester of Despia - One of the most important monsters in the main deck, Aluber searches any of your branded spell/trap cards</span>  <span>3x Despian of tragedy - searches when used for fusion material and recycles branded spells</span>  <span>2x Dramaturge of Despia - Strengthens your fusion plays with another negate. Perfect fusion material as it comes back when used for fusion material, even if its banished.</span>  <span>1x Tribrigade Mercourier - Good search target for brigand or can be banished with branded in red/white for a search.</span>  <span>3x PSY Framegear Gamma - Great going second handtrap</span>  <span>1x PSY Frame Driver - Dont draw this</span> <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> <span>1x Branded in High Spirits - Can mill construct for free graveyard material for Mirrorjade, but is searchable and not required to play at high numbers. </span>  <span>2x Despia, Theater of The Branded - This Collosal Base is one of the fusion spells of the deck. It can also revive a fusion monster if your opponent destroys a non-fusion despia, but that most likely won’t happen</span>  <span>2x Branded in White - Uses materials from hand field and graveyard as long as you use Albaz or Albion(most of the time Albaz) as material</span>  <span>2x Branded in Red - The best fusion spell in the deck, can fuse monsters at quick effect speed and uses cards from hand field and graveyard without needing to use dragons.</span>  <span>3x Branded Opening - Grabs a despia straight from your deck.</span>  <span>3x Dark Ruler No More - Negates the effects of all opponent monsters at the cost of losing all battle damage</span>  <span>3x Super polymerization - Even if Aluber or Albaz are negated, super poly can be used to insulate plays and break boards</span>  <span>2x Forbidden Droplet - Another going second negation tool but is played at 2 because of how many cards in hand it requires</span> <blockquote><div>Trap</div></blockquote> <span>1x Branded Condemnation - Your primary target to send off of Albion, as it can recycle your other branded spells</span> <blockquote><div>Extra Deck</div></blockquote> <span>2x Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon - Good new endboard card, but be careful with its effect as if you use it in one turn, you wont be able to use it on the next turn</span>  <span>1x Rubellion the Divineflame Dragon - An extender that recycles materials</span>  <span>1x Guardian Chimera - Draws and pops cards and in this deck has little downside to its materials</span>  <span>2x Albion the Branded Dragon -  The other albion, this card is another fusion monster that lets you extend into other fusion plays</span>  <span>1x Titaniklad the Ash Dragon - A beater that you will rarely ever summon. Fuel for mirrorjade</span>  <span>1x Brigand the Glory Dragon - better fuel for mirrorjade as it can search mercourier</span>  <span>1x Despia Proscenium - I have stolen a dragoon 3 times with this card.</span>  <span>1x Masquerade the Blazing Dragon - another end board card that burns the opponent for cards used. I dropped this after a battle phase and my opponent had 2500 lp left. Like nibiru but if you activate 5 effects you lose</span>  <span>2x Despia Quaerteris - Easiest despia monster to fusion summon</span>  <span>1x Starving venom fusion dragon - super poly target</span>  <span>1x El Shaddoll Construct - Fuel for high spirits</span>  <span>1x PSY Framelord Omega - when you gamma on your own turn.</span> <blockquote><div>Tips</div></blockquote> ALWAYS GO SECOND  <span>Banish the Construct sent off of High Spirits as material for Mirrorjade</span>  <span>If your hand isnt all that good, you can leave ecclesia on the field to use albaz on the opponents turn.</span>  super polymerization doesn't have to be used at the beginning of a turn. super polymerization is also somewhat of a negation insulator as you can fuse off your and your opponents monsters to dodge some negates like impermanence or effect veiler  &nbsp;"

Winterkills has a wonderful masterclass video over the deck if you're looking for a means of entry into the deck. He also has another deck profile in the video so I suggest checking it out.  &nbsp;  The main thing with this deck that is different is that it has revolving switchyard (only 2 cause you draw so readily). It allows for the ability to play through more hand traps and has another resource loop in bullet train and railroad stampede.  I'm also not playing any monster hand traps cause so many people are on triple tactics talents.  &nbsp;  The forbidden chalice would be droplets if they were a little cheaper, but even with the upcoming reprint, I'm not sure they will be under $50, so they aren't going in anytime soon, but if you have them, this deck has a lot of cards that work in the grave.  &nbsp;  Overall, the deck is extremely fun.... and rather competative too! There are tons of videos on youtube for this decks combos (the train community is kinda huge at this point lol) so there are plenty of resources to learn to play it!"

Caspar and Starfire are the obvious three-ofs while the other ratios are very flexible. Doc, Wild and Calamity are very niche but still enable your Musket Spell/Traps and are good summons off of Max. Kidbrave I play at 2 since it's a pure deck with a lot of names to discard but it does require another card in hand to be useful. </span>  <span>The Extra Deck is one giant toolbox. Ningirsu is non-targetting non-destructive removal, two eXceed can go into Jammer who can then be linked off for Equimax, who'll easily OTK your opponent with DPE in it's zone. Or yknow, just use Accesscode like all the rich kids do. Underworld Goddess since why not, the usual Knightmare, Verte because you can make Verte and a little bit of a r4nk here, a r4nk there.</span>"

After a lot of thought i decided to go for a relatively pure build with Enforcer, simply because Floowandereeze and Shifter can result in a lot of Tenyi build hands unable to really go off. The Swordsoul plays themselves, while more vulnerable under Shifter, still often result in Chi Xiao/Baronne boards and should be sufficient to stop most Flundereeze hands on the first turn by themselves. Enforcer and it's looping destruction is also super handy for the deck as well.  The basic Swordsoul core is in there, with the possible exception of Summit. Some play it, some don't, however having that additional chance of a 3rd/4th monster going 1st with the better hands is too tempting to ignore. Usually going blind 1st I setup Chi Xio, Baronne, and either Omega if they've already tried to handtrap me, to rip an additional card from hand as well as gain deck knowledge, allowing me to have a better idea of where to use my interruptions or Riser due to the vast amount of powerful spell/traps there are. Games 2 and 3 i can change the 3rd monster to whatever is more devastating to that particular deck.  Handtrap wise i went with 2 Ash, 1 Nibiru, 2 Droll and 2 Imperm. The Droll are most effective against Lyrussic Tri and Floowandereeze because i want to try and prevent Barrier Statue from hitting the field. Also Droll is still effective against a lot of other meta decks due to the number of searches they have. If someone has the same idea as me it can also be a crossout target too, as sometimes i need to dig with Desires/Emergence and being droll'd there can make things awkward. Nibiru is mainly a crossout target and is beginning to be mained a lot as well, Ash and Imperm are the generic handtraps that can be used as well as crossout targets if needed.  Not much to be said about the spells. 2 crossout i believe is about right, 3 feels too bricky when you factor in the fusion destiny package. 2 DRNM simply because trying to out things like Statue, Dragoon, Herald and the mirror match can be a headache. The additonal traps are 2 Blackout because I want as many Swordsoul names as possible and extra grinding capability and Imperial Order to prevent opposing DRNM as well as any strategy heavily reliant on spell cards to carry out their plays.  The Extra deck is somewhat standard, perhaps the only thing that is different is the one copy of Dingirsu. The deck has a lot of capability in generating level 8's and also has two that can float. Having additional non targeting removal and an arguably easier way to get to Zeus can sometimes be of great benefit.  The side deck is primarily equipped to anticipate going second. 3 copies of Dimensional Barrier allow me to prevent many decks from being able to play. Shutting down the mirror, the ritial part of Drytron, the Lyrussic part of the Tri-Brigade builds, Fusion strategies, VW Synchros and the XYZ PK plays allows the deck to not be overwhealmed with too many things to try and interrupt.  &nbsp;"

The way this deck works is to turbo out Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon, Dystopia the Despondent, and/or Number F0: Utopic Future if going first and Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale or Zeus if going second. The reason why it's so consistent is because 38 of the cards are co-dependent, so ~99% of your starting hands won't brick because each card gets each other out. The other 2, Ash Blossom and Solemn Strike (other negates in the side deck if wanted), are the two ( or more/less) negates required so that way you don't die. Now for some questions I know some people will be wondering.  -Why not run 3 copies of Cobalt Sparrow and (insert the name of the gray main deck Lyrilusc card whose name I forgot, her effect is to search a Lyrilusc spell/trap to the hand)?  Both cards' effects are a hard once per turn, so you wouldn't gain anything from summoning multiples. Also, neither of them can summon themselves, so it would make more sense to run just 1 copy of each to lower the brick rate as much as possible while still running them for their sweet, sweet effects.  -Why are there so few negates in the main deck?  Every monster in this deck is either level 1 or a hand trap, so there are a minimum amount of negates to lower the brick rate. That's also why the rest of the negates are in the side deck, so you can add/subtract to the negate count. It should honestly stay at 2, they're good emergency use cards and the actual negates come in the form of Utopic Future Dragon.  -Can't you just Kaiju or Lava Golem the Future Dragon?  Yes you can, but more likely than not, you can get out 2 dragons. And seeing how you give your opponent a 3000 attack beatstick by using Lava Golem and Kaijus being completely dependent on the heart of the cards, I think you're fine.  -Why is there a random link monster in an Xyz-based deck?  Utopic Future Dragon's effect is to negate a monster effect activation and kidnap the monster if it was on the field. Due to how widespread monster effects are in the competitive metagame, this puts a shutdown to that. But if your opponent were to just not read the dragon's effect, you'd need a link monster that can handle 3 effect monsters because you'll have 3 remaining monster zones after the dual dragon turboing. So you have a monster that can kidnap monsters at will. If you'd like, you can swap it out for Borrelsword.  I think that's all the questions, and I have nothing else to add, so I guess I'll see you around!"

Two decks I have always loved are HEROES and Kozmo, and until recently they really couldn't be played together in a cohesive strategy. However, that all changed with the release of Destiny HERO- Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. with DPE's effect destroying your ships triggering their effects to get you more advantage while getting a pop on your opponent's side of the field is always nice. What this also does is allow for cool turn ones on the play, and the draw as well. I know the deck is over 40 cards and I'm working on cutting it down any feedback and criticism are greatly appreciated."

Yes you can take out 1 Coinorma, 1 Arrowsylph and 1 Hedgehog for 3 Ash Blossom. But since I play local and  non competitive I don't have these cards.  Your main objective with this deck would be to bring out Tarotrei using Pot Of The Forbidden as a tribute so you can SS it with Tarotrei's effect during the end phase. Then just use the Shaddolls to inflict damage to your opponent.  I built this deck after the Construct ban a long time ago that's why you see no light monsters here(4 should be enough because there's super poly as well)."

Because of just how many engines there are, there’s actually no real way for your opponent to know what to expect; it plays on their expectations in later matches when you pull out Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord instead of sitting on your Magical Musket interruptions and a Phoenix Enforcer. Plus it’s just fun to play because of the variety!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The idea for this came out of trying to optimize another of my favorite archetypes, Magical Musket (the Musket part in MEHD), which had a problem with keeping its low-ATK monsters on the field for the turn. I went through an Eldlich variation a while back, which worked relatively well but had problems with consistency. Then I was reading the Despia article that came out this week, and I realized that changing your opponent’s monsters’ attack to zero was a sure way of making it through the Battle Phase with your weak Magical Musket monsters. Thus, an idea was born: why not combine all three, plus add a 5-card fusion engine that’s all the rage now? </span>  &nbsp; <h1><b>The Main Deck</b></h1> <h2><span>Tech cards:</span></h2> &nbsp;  <span>In order to maintain consistency, I tried to limit the amount of engine-based cards to 36 so I could keep 3 Pot of Prosperity and an Upstart Goblin. I exceeded my expectations, keeping it to 30 cards, allowing 6 additional tech choices, of which I chose Summon Limit and Lord of the Heavenly Prison to slow down the opponent and add another body and consistency. Lord of the Heavenly Prison can give you protection and a free Spell/Trap, or it can just provide a body by setting and then activating a normal spell (this is useful when you really need a Liebe).</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Magical Musket Engine:</span></h2> <span>The Magical Musket engine I streamlined as much as humanly possible to still get good results: 2 each of Starfire and Casper and 1 of each of the 4 best Magical Musket Spell/Traps. Magical Musket works very well with Eldlich the Golden Lord, as the Spell/Traps are useless without their monster counterparts, so they’re free of cost for use with the Golden One. Also, because of the massive amount of spells in this deck, you will almost always have enough to activate both Starfire’s effect to summon Caspar and Casper’s effect to add a Musket Spell/Trap, giving you an interruption or Spell/Trap negate. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>It’s actually interesting because I thought the Musket Engine would wind up being useless due to the power of the other engines. However, they actually prove incredibly useful! All of the Magical Musket monsters can activate their effects if your opponent plays a Spell/Trap in their column. So if they’re dumb enough to activate a Prosperity vertical of your Caspar, you get to search another Trap for interuption! Magical Musketeer MAX can be an automatic Verte, Phoenix or even Unicorn depending on how many Spell/Traps your opponent has, or it can just be a good way to net interruptions, as it too is a Magical Musket monster. The Magical Musket Spell/Traps are also immune to Spell/Trap removal, as they can be activated from hand. The only reason you would need to set them is for Lord of the Heavenly Prison’s effect. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>So, even though I only included them for my own pleasure, they actually have some phenomenal utility I wouldn’t otherwise have.</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Eldlich Engine:</span></h2> <span>The E in MEHD and the beef of the deck at a 12 card engine, this too is a bit more streamline compared to typical iterations of the Eldlich archetype, cutting Eldlixir of Black Awakening entirely and playing only two each of Haquero and Conquistador. Eldland and Sanguine are still at three for maximum utility, however, and the Golden Lord himself is at two. I also added one Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord in the extra deck because you can summon it and it is a pain to out. There are a few ways to play Eldlich that I think may be different from the norm with this deck, so let me go over those:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First off, you NEVER want to keep Eldland into the Battle Phase, because it locks you out of attacking with anything other than Zombie monsters. Also, use Sanguine exclusively on your opponent’s turn: it locks you into Zombie monsters, which you don’t have a lot of (or really any of). Also, if you need to get rid of floodgates (ie Summon Limit or Eldland) or you have a useless Spell/Trap (ie spare Branded Openings or Destiny Fusions), simply set them and use Eldlich’s effect in the grave to remove it and get a free, hard-to-out body on the field. Thus, it can be imperative to get Eldlich in the grave. There are a few ways to do this: Link Summoning, Fusion Summoning and Eldland’s second effect. All of these are possible and can get your Golden Lord to the grave for that free body or necessary removal (which you would only need to do if you need to get out Accesscode or Liebe to beat over a stupid powerful monster). I think that’s it for the differences, and everyone reading this should know how to play Eldlich. If not, there’s a comments section for questions.</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>HERO Engine:</span></h2> <span>This is your typical Destroy Phoenix Enforcer engine. The only notable interactions with the other engines in this one are that Enforcer won’t have its attack changed to zero by Quaeritis’ effect due to being a Level 8 Fusion monster. You can also set all of your Spell/Traps to make use of Celestial’s effect. Your leftover Fusion Destinys can be used as fodder for the Golden Lord’s effects. Magical Musketeer Starfire can be a free Verte if you need an Enforcer that bad.</span> <h2><span>Despia Engine:</span></h2> <span>The reason I initially put this in was because of Quaeritis’ unique effect which helped with keeping my poorly equipped Magical Musketeers on the board for the next turn. But it then turned out it had a whole lot of utility, as Theater of the Branded can fusion the Mad Golden Lord and once used can be removed for cost. Note that every monster in the deck is LIGHT or DARK to maximize the utility of the fusions, though Proskenion is almost never summoned (and is a prime Prosperity target). I am incredibly proud of how this engine has performed, and I wouldn’t get rid of it. It’s also another normal-summonless fusion engine for any Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika players who want something different to have. Note that Opening does require a discard (but it’s not for cost, so if it’s Ashed you don’t have to!)</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Extra Deck:</span></h2> <span>Most of the Extra Deck is self explanatory, however I have a few notes:</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>You almost never use the Xyz monsters, and most of them are useless unless going second.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>That being said, the three machine Xyz monsters are one of your only two ways to beat over huge bodies and are also your best OTK strategy going second (you can make Gustav using Golden Lord and Lord of the Heavenly Prison)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Prosperity targets tend to be the Xyz and Fusions you won’t use plus the extra Musketeer MAX and/or Imduk.</span></li> </ol> &nbsp; <h2><span>Side Deck:</span></h2> <span>The side deck is a bit thrown together, however it includes a lot of going second options because this deck is absolute trash going second. I suggest messing with it. Summon Limit and LotHP are typically the ones you’ll side out.</span>  &nbsp; <h2><span>Final Notes:</span></h2> <span>There aren’t any handtraps in this one because you won’t need them: you’re going first. And anyways, they didn’t fit. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>As always, if you have any questions, ask in the comments. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks for reading this long article; I have another deck that I’m proud of if you want to look at it. It’s Code Talker, and it has a VERY different playstyle, so maybe you’ll be into it if you don’t like this one.

Who said Swordsoul is boring.,"<strong>For those who wanted a more creative Tenyi Swordsoul list look no further! </strong>  <span>Switch these cards to change from Combo to control:</span> <span>Combo uses: <em>1 Shthana, 1 Mare Mare, 3 Dark Ruler no More, 2 Emergency Teleport, 1 Forbidden chalice;</em></span> <span>Control uses: <em>2 Solemn Judgement, 3 Gravity Collaps, 3 Guiding Ariadne;</em></span>  It can do multiple combo's but and it all starts what u have in you hand. There are multiple paths to get into Mare Mare Combo. It all depends if you go second as you need to destroy a card with Yazi.  <em>Prep for yazi:</em> Option 1:<em> To get into yazi you have 2 tenyi'x at least 1 tuner -&gt; Halq -&gt; Ghost ogre -&gt; banish ashuna for Shthana and make Yazi.</em> Option 2: <em>Emergency teleport + Ashuna or Shthana -&gt; Yazi.</em> Option 3: <em>Swordsoul emergence -&gt; Taia banish Emergence -&gt; Yazi</em>  The above options are easier with consitency cards like Vessel and even normal summoning Ghost Ogre is fine. Halqi fibrax helps with getting ghost ogre as the level 3 tuner. Use Yazi to go into mare mare. This is where its gets fun! As Mare Mare allows you to get 3 tokens and tokens are great!  <strong>It depends what you want</strong>  Destroy monsters: <em>If you have Halq on board you can use Mare Mare and Halq to go into Draco masters of the Tenyi to destroy effect monsters up to 4 of you have Monk in grave.</em>  Need swordsoul: <em>Use Ashuna to special Shthana + lvl 4 Mare Mare to make Chixiou search for swordsoul longuan.  Link 2 tokens into Shaman Use longuan and  (adhara can add a wyrm back to you hand to use as cost)  synchro into Chengying. Discard 1 card to special mare mare draco beserker. This is well over 11900 damage.</em>  Get Halqi and synchro with 1 card: <em>Swordsoul emergence -&gt; Taia.  Summon Taia banish Emergence to special token and reduce level.</em> <em>Synchro token and Taia to make Yazi.  Sending Mo Ye Use its effect to destroy -&gt; special Mare Mare from deck, use effect to special 3 tokens. Use Mare Mare + token for Halq use effect to Special Ghost Ogre from deck. Use Ghost ogre + 2nd Token to make cupid Pitch increase its lvl to 7. Sycnhro cupid pitch and 3rd Token to make Chixiou or baxia.</em>  <strong>Control variant:</strong> Yazi isn't a core aspect. Halqi is the king of this combo. If you go first Turn 1 is making halq with the Tenyi's and using Guiding Adriane to search a counter trap with Baxia destruction effect. Baxia can be made with Taia or Mo ye. Gravity Collaps is the main target to stun your opponent. Also Halq summons Ghost Ogre from deck for another distruption.

If you need to swap out cards, I recommend one less Navigation, <a data-name=""Magician of Dark Illusion"">Magician of Dark Illusion</a>, and maybe<a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician""> Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>.  General strategy is to find a way to set <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> (<a data-name=""Magician's Salvation"">Magician's Salvation</a> is one way of doing that) and throw Dark Magician cards (including DM the Dragon Knight) into your GY. Dogmatika splash cards are excellent for that too. Dragoon is there for classic disgusting play and passes."

This allows you to exchange combo pieces as required, exchange duplicates, or in a pinch, allows you to exchange a Dragoon material for any other monster.  Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Eva are the only real outliers, but for REBD, you can reveal Idaten to add any Drytron monster you need, and for Eva, you can banish Draconids.  In addition, Sauravis can be used to negate Infinite Impermanence, which is the bane of any hand with Triple Tactics Talent.  This can also be used to: <ul>  	<li>Add ANY monster card to your hand (except Red-Eyes Black Dragon) using Sauravis as the second target.</li>  	<li>Swap a Machine (aka. Drytron) for another. For example: Delta into Alpha.</li>  	<li>Swap a Fairy for another. For example: Orange Light into Diviner.

DISCLAIMER : This deck currently is not at full power, as it still gets the new Fusion in the coming months. So while this game can win games currently if handled right, it will take more skill than it will after the structure deck releases, at that point this deck will have a much stronger pressure with more streamlined plays. So keep that in mind and also dont worry if you mess up while testing, even though I have been playing maids since release, in all forms, this version makes me missplay or do suboptimal plays too. But the better you get with it , the more rewarding it feels. Also lets not kid ourself Albus and Ecclesia would look cute in maid uniforms.  But first of all a replay to show what this deck can do CURRENTLY , as mentioned it will get better plays soon. So here is a meta game vs birds : In comments  So lets get into the card by card :  3x Albion the shrouded. Its mainly there for 2 purposes, send to grave as big dragon for your maid fusions and making branded in red live. If you dont need it, its still a upstart goblin that sometimes baits an ash cause people cant read.  3x Dragonmaid Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3x Dragonmaid Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1x Dragonmaid Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  1x   Dragonmaid Ernus : Can summon a maid in your opponents turn before they set up the negats , else just for its name and level  1x Dragonmaid Lorpar : Name and Level again. But its also a decent card to force a negate with its discard effect and it screws Zeus.  2x  Noctovision : Make striker = free summon,. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype. Also it chain blocks your Fallen of Albaz super poly effect : D  2x  Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With Sky Striker and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for cards and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair. Also it annoys sky striker and we love to do that  1x Tempest Dragonruler of Storms : Its a extender that searches when banished. What else do you want? More Dragonruler?Konami says no  2x  Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck.  1x Ecclesia : Basically you can search her when you go second or have a super poly on legs that you can chain block if you brick hard / get negated in your turn  3x High spirits of the Branded : I think this card explains itself, its just bonkers broken and should never have been printed. It allows infinite combos and gives you any extender you need + a free add in the Ep. AND it can recycle itself.  1x Branded in Red : Its a searchable fusion that recycles Material and can be used during your opponents turn to dodge the flash Drnm and stuff. Not much to explain I hope  3x  TTT : Yep TTT, Yep draw 2 , Yep steal your monster  3x  Droplet : Negate all and just combo from gy. simple  2x  Dragons Mirror : Banish stuff from gy to make Sheou and if you have tempest also get a free search  1x Called by the grave : Why. Does. this. still. exist.  3x tidiyng : extender who also can be used as interrupt or to dodge cards out mine, trigger House and so much more  &nbsp;  Extra Deck :  I really feel like there is not much to say here, make sheou + sphere and than just use whatever you need when you need it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Besides the Virtual World core, every aspect of the deck can be changed to the pilot!  Typically, the Synchro monsters are used while going first, while the XYZ monsters are your offensive options (barring Number 75, which is your Nibiru block). If you get the right set up on Game 1, you can go for the Caliga/Crystal wing board to hold down your opponent's board. I wouldn't recommend going for it in Game 2 or 3, however, as it's pretty susceptible to backrow (especially Dark Ruler No More).  <span><strong>GOING FIRST</strong></span> The best board I've built is Wolfrayet (play this first so you can generate attack gain to turn it's quick effect live), ShenShen and Chuche with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on board as well. This board provides constant disruption, with Shen sending everything from field to GY (laughs at Live Twins), Wolfrayet intimidating your opponent from spinning their entire monster row back into the deck (either limiting the monster effects they want to play, or the monsters they put on field in the first place), and both Chuche and DPE being constant threats of quick destruction.  The only issue with DPE &amp; Shen is that, if DPE leaves the field w/o Shen, DPE will be banished, and can't be revived by it's own effect. So it's the effect you want to activate last, if you can. And when you do, Shen will be your target. You can recur Shen on your next turn, so it's not the biggest deal. But you do lose your interruption of cards from field to banish instead of GY. But with that slight drawback comes the ability to make HUGE PLAYS on your Turn 3.  If you're not OTK'd after going first, you will likely have all that you need to break your opponent's field. Denier &amp; Malicious in GY lets you summon Denier for free. Doing so can revive NyanNyan as a tuner, which will get banished when it leaves the field. You can then use the Malicious in GY to summon one from hand. With no other set up, you are able to summon a Rank 3 XYZ, a Rank 6 XYZ, a Level 6 Synchro, a Level 9 Synchro, or a Level 12 Synchro! And when you Synchro with Nyan and it's banished, you can return the Malicious back to your deck, then used the Malicious in GY to summon the one from GY again! And don't forget, if you set yourself up, you'll have a Qinglong, Chuche and/or Xuanwu to make the plays you want. If you play well, you should have a board every turn.  <span><strong>GOING SECOND</strong></span> XYZ monsters will typically be your best play. Depending on your board, the Level/Rank 6 Virtual World ED monsters can come through for you, with Jiujiu being indestructible and able to send one card on field to the GY, or Fanfan banishing one face-up card and one card in either GY, as well as floating on destruction. Utopia Beyond is amazing for nerfing any high stated monster (I used it so I can out Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax). And AA-Zeus is AA-Zeus; self explanatory.  The deck is flexible, so assess the board that your opponent created; more often than not, you'll have a way to break it.  <span><strong>SIDING</strong></span> The main targets I sided out were <ul>  	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring x2</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial Goods x1</li>  	<li>Emergency Teleport x1</li>  	<li>Fusion Destiny x1</li> </ul> That gives you five cards to work with. However, siding is flexible in every match, so swap to what you think is best (there were some times were I even sided out one Impermanence)  The main focus of the siding is the Crossout Designators, and I feel VWs can play through almost anything as long as interruptions are blocked. After game 1, I always side in Crossouts and one Nibiru &amp; DRNM, as those cards can blow open your field. And of course, every sideboard needs backrow hate. The Effect Veiler was here in case I came across heavy combo decks I wanted to block ASAP (Floowandereeze, for example).  <span><strong>WHAT I'D CHANGE</strong></span> After going 4-2 at locals (losing to Dragon Link and Floowandereeze), I would change the following... <ul>  	<li><strong>Taking out the Ultimaya package</strong>. While the board CAN work, it's also incredibly telegraphed, and can be blocked hard. And with the board being so committal of an option, too much needs to go right and I only made this board once in all of my matches that day.</li>  	<li><strong>Add a quick Zombie World package.</strong> Floowandereeze is a PAIN for this deck. But I learned after my match with Floowan that I could have easily added Beatrice/Necroworld Banshee/Zombie World package and be able to essentially block the entire deck. I would take out Effect Veilers and one Twin Twisters from my deck deck for the main deck cards.</li>  	<li><strong>Add Cloudcastle (other two ED spots flexible)</strong>. I found myself with situations where I wanted to revive Shen w/o banishing targets, and making Cloudcastle would have corrected that immediately. And I want to try Crystron Quariongandrax and Jinzo - Layered or Photon Strike Bounzer, as they are both solid options as well.</li> </ul> <strong>FINAL WORDS</strong> Virtual World has quickly grown to become my favorite deck. It's strategy allows it to dodge many staple hand traps, and can build into unique boards that you won't see many other decks utilize (Level/Rank 3/6/9 monster pool!). Plus, if played properly, the entire deck recovers itself! The release of Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer only pushes this deck further.

To do that we have batteryman solar and foolish burial to send him to gy, and we have mahunder/pahunder and photon sanctuary to summon some summer summoner, alowing you to special summon rai-oh you milled during your opponent turn. I also used ties of the brethren to bring him from the deck and lightning rod lord as an extra ties target. And also i used recycling batteries to recycle your smaller monsters as an extender/follow up. Other than that, the other cards are draw, defenses and toolbox."

Use 'Astral Kuriboh' or 'Right-Hand Shark' to set up a 'Number 59: Crooked Cook' and ensure he's the only card on the field.  As soon as you have 'Creature Swap' or 'Mystic Box' in the clear use your remaining resources to summon 'Bahamut Shark' and cheat 'Number 30 Acid Golem of Destruction' onto your side of the field to use as the card sent to your opponent.

Detailed explanation within + combos.","Detailed breakdown of why everything is run in this deck and how everything functions. If you're new to Blue Eyes or want a succinct breakdown for a meta competitive deck, you're in the right place.  Deck and structural information below created by Teng, the Nexus Blue Eyes legend.  <em><span><strong>Main Deck:</strong></span></em> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a></strong> is the core of what makes the deck function. Most cards rely on this card to get summoned out or play out their effects.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon</a></strong> is an easy card to summon out and it can target a card for destruction. This card counts as a Blue-Eyes White Dragon when it is on the field and/or the graveyard so it can unlock other cards in the decks effects when in either location.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon</a></strong> is a card that at base will always protect all other cards from destruction when it is on the field regardless of anything else. When you have a Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field or in the graveyard it can also unlock all of its other effects, which includes a special summon whenever something is destroyed and a bounce before battle step. This card provides a lot of defense to your field. Blue-Eyes Alternative Dragon compliments well with this card.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a></strong> is a generic dragon extender that can usually help you make more plays depending on what the game state is.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Chaos Dragon Levianeer&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer</strong> </a>is much like Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon that it can extend plays with its revival, but it can also provide destruction if you need it, which can also proc Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon</a></strong> searches for Polymerization when it is summoned and can search basically any of the high level dragons on the end of your turn to set yourself up potentially for your next turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Spirit of White&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> </a>is a targeting banish toward the backrow and bypasses destruction protection.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""The Tyrant of D"">The Tyrant of D</a>.</strong> can mill a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong>, can send a card from your hand to the grave to revive a Blue-Eyes monster, and is one of the best starters in the deck. You can also pick what the opponent attacks if you have a Blue-Eyes monster on the field with it.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""White Stone of Ancients"">White Stone of Ancients</a></strong> can special summon out any of your Blue-Eyes monsters at the end of your turn. This can plant <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> onto the field to enable effects, summon out <strong>Abyss</strong> to draw a Polymerization and a dragon, get out <strong>Jet</strong>, or summon <strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> to pop a card with its banish.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""White Stone of Legend"">White Stone of Legend</a></strong> has you draw a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> whenever it is sent to the graveyard.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Sage with Eyes of Blue"">Sage with Eyes of Blue</a></strong> can discard and target an effect monster on your side of the field to summon the same dragons listed for <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong> or it can be normal summoned to search for<strong> White Stone of Legends</strong>, which <strong>Tyrant</strong> can then toss, <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong>, <strong>Maiden with Eyes of Blue</strong>, and even <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> if you choose to run that. <strong>Sage</strong> works amazingly well with <strong>Tyrant</strong>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Maiden with Eyes of Blue&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Maiden with Eyes of Blue</strong> </a>is mainly here for the potential utility she has with Sage for potential Xyz or link plays. She also works well with Apparition to get more cards onto the field.</li> </ul> <div class=""message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""article"" data-list-item-id=""chat-messages___chat-messages-913226919745581056"" aria-setsize=""-1"" aria-roledescription=""Message"" aria-labelledby=""message-username-913225290027794493 uid_1 message-content-913226919745581056 uid_2 message-timestamp-913226919745581056"" aria-describedby=""""> <div class=""contents-2mQqc9""> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lord"">Return of the Dragon Lord</a></strong> is a revive that gives destruction protection. It can protect one or all of your dragons from immediate destruction, be it from battle or card effects, one time. Combine this with <strong>Jet</strong> and you could retain your protection on the field even if they manage to have had a pop on <strong>Jet</strong>.</li>  	<li><b><a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> </b>is because you only have two other forms of backrow removal in this deck in the way of <strong>Dragon Spirit of White</strong> or <strong>Ultimate Fusion</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> flows well with <strong>Abyss</strong> as it can be searched by it and it can work in conjunction with <strong>Ultimate Fusion</strong> to get out more than one fusion for a turn.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Melody of Awakening Dragon"">Melody of Awakening Dragon</a></strong> is your main search that can search most of your high level dragons. It opens up a lot of your plays and opens up the engine along with Sage and the Stones.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a></strong> allows you to either potentially bait a negate, draw a card after you've expended your searches, and thins the deck so you can get straight to your engine.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> is an extender that can revive legitimately anything from either graveyard. This can open up plays that may not have been possible before, recover a play that was negated, or simply revive a boss monster or key monster from your opponent's graveyard to enhance your field or disrupt them.</li>  	<li id=""chat-messages-913228754984263680"" class=""messageListItem-1-jvGY"" aria-setsize=""-1""> <div class=""message-2qnXI6 cozyMessage-3V1Y8y groupStart-23k01U wrapper-2a6GCs cozy-3raOZG zalgo-jN1Ica"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""article"" data-list-item-id=""chat-messages___chat-messages-913228754984263680"" aria-setsize=""-1"" aria-roledescription=""Message"" aria-labelledby=""message-username-913228754984263680 uid_1 message-content-913228754984263680 uid_2 message-timestamp-913228754984263680"" aria-describedby=""""> <div class=""contents-2mQqc9""> <div id=""message-content-913228754984263680"" class=""markup-2BOw-j messageContent-2qWWxC""><strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong> allows you to break boards and compliments Blue-Eyes due to how Stones and Sage functions.

The card does send cards that you use back to the deck, so be careful not to send all of your <strong>Blue-Eyes</strong> if you have other cards dependent on having one either on the field or in the graveyard or they will be crippled.</div></li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Apparition with Eyes of Blue"">Apparition with Eyes of Blue</a></strong> allows you to reveal a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> to summon a monster from your hand.

Keep in mind this does not protect against Kaiju.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""True Light"">True Light</a></strong> is basically Eternal Soul for <strong>Blue-Eyes</strong> so it can search a <strong>Blue-Eyes</strong> spell/trap card or summon a <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong> from your hand or graveyard.</li> </ul> <strong><em><span>Extra Deck: </span></em></strong> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon</a></strong> is the best Ultimate Dragon form that Blue-Eyes has due to its power, its protections, and its ability to pop between 1-3 cards.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Twin Burst"">Blue-Eyes Twin Burst</a></strong> is immune to battle destruction and anything it attacks is subjected to being banished if it survives.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon</a></strong> is immune to traps, can attack every monster the opponent has on the field, and can retrieve trap cards from your graveyard.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Baroness De Fleur"">Baroness De Fleur</a></strong> works is an omni-negate that can revive anything lower level than her after her negate runs out to either be remade again, to revive a combo piece, or to perhaps retrieve another boss monster you had lost or used up.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon"">Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon</a></strong> protects all dragons from destruction and prevents your opponent from targeting your dragons. It only applies to the dragons that were on the field when it had first been summoned and it does not count as a Blue-Eyes monster, so keep those things in mind.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon</a></strong> is a floodgate that prevents two monster from being summoned at once from either side of the field. This limits what an opponent can do already, but it can also negate an effect activated in the graveyard and can tag out to another light dragon, such as <strong>Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon</strong>.</li>  	<li><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""""><b><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> </b></span>can summon a tuner and tags out into<strong> Formula Synchron</strong> for the <strong>Baroness</strong> play.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a></strong> combines with a <strong>Blue-Eyes</strong> monster after <strong>Needlefiber</strong> tags out for it to create <strong>Baroness</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a></strong> is a field wipe, it's a send so destruction protection does not save monsters, that is made off of <strong>Dingirsu</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a></strong> is a non-targeting send and protects other cards from destruction much like <strong>Return</strong> does, but it applies to more than just dragons. It can also attack a higher level monster, detach, and then become <strong>Zeus</strong> to make a play with <strong>Zeus</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Avramax&lt;/strong&gt;"">Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax </a></strong>can overcome most boss monsters, particularly ones with protections from destruction or targeting. With <strong>IP</strong> he can't be destroyed either on top of his natural ability to avoid targeting. For when he is killed, he can bounce back an opponent's card back to the deck.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> is a targeting bounce to get around floating effects when monsters are sent to the graveyard. It also can work with <strong>IP</strong> to activate on the opponent's turn to bounce back a combo piece from the opponent to disrupt their plays. The discard could also be used to send one of your stones from hand to the graveyard.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;I:P Masquerna&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>IP Masquerena</strong></a> can work on the opponent's turn.

On top of the bounce it also can summon a dragon from your deck. (<strong>Jet</strong>)</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a></strong> is mainly here to transform your stones into a link and for its compatibility with <strong>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal</strong> because then you don't have to banish your Stones to summon it out.

This is an extremely budget and casual version of the build with a lot of room for improvement.  I would highly recommend changing the Mask of restricts for any other card in the game. Their inclusion is for Kaijus but if that's not a worry then play anything else you would like.

Bird Up,baby.","Standard bird list. I do not use the Dogmatika engine because I don't like it,and personally this deck is better without it. If your opponent knows you're on Floo,Nadir is no longer Ash bait. if you don't open the field spell,which is half the time,you won't be able to even access the Dogmatika engine,or your birds. So I chose to run Cherries targets,and Harpie's Feather Storm. Cherries is sometimes an auto-win,and Feather Storm buys you a turn when things go wrong,or when you can't reach your win condition and your bird is negated. You can just snowball next turn after activating Feather Storm,since you mostly won't die."

It covers card choices and engines, core combos and end-boards, and the larger contradicti","I received a lot of great feedback from players on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/rank-8-dragon-link-1-0/"">my Rank-8 Dragon Link deck profile</a>, which turned out more like an essay on my introduction to modern deck-building theory. Because so much of it dealt with how I moved from Blue-Eyes into a more typical Dragon Link deck, inevitably I also received questions from Blue-Eyes players about my previous deck build discussed in the profile. That's more or less what I'm showcasing here. Like the first, this deck profile also turned out quite long. This deck worked pretty well for me at locals, taking fifth and just missing the top-4 in the second tournament I'd ever played. But I've also discarded this build for a more standard Dragon Link deck because I'm realistic about its overall competitive viability. In writing this deck profile, I've tried to highlight some of the theory behind it as well as the BEWD archetype as a whole.  Let's make this clear right off the bat:<em><strong> This is</strong><strong> absolutely not 'the best Blue-Eyes deck ever'. </strong></em>I'm skeptical of anyone even claiming that distinction.<strong> </strong>This is the Blue-Eyes Dragon Link deck I built and saw some success with at locals. But I've decided to profile it here in order to draw out some general theory about the game as a whole and Blue-Eyes in particular. The first half of this profile opens with these more general points on theory. The second half covers the deck itself, outlining some key combos, card choices and the extra-deck. Pay no heed to the side deck here--it's more or less a straight holdover from the list I actually ran a few months back.  <span><strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon &amp; its Contradictions</strong></span>  I started playing YuGiOh again in July 2021 after a nearly two-decade hiatus. Like countless nostalgic millennials re-visiting the game, I gravitated toward the familiar and set to work building a Blue-Eyes White Dragon deck. Blue-Eyes White Dragon may not be the ultimate creature of destruction, but there's no question it's the ultimate creature of <em>fixation</em> among a huge swath of YuGiOh players.  Naturally, Blue-Eyes players have developed countless builds and strategies to play the deck, even as it remains totally irrelevant to the competitive meta-game. Some prefer a purer Blue-Eyes deck that focuses entirely on the monster, its surrounding archetype and the sizable amount of support churned out by Konami over the years. More competitive-minded players, however, typically build Blue-Eyes decks that borrow from other archetypes and strategies to boost the deck's power, consistency and more. It should be said, none of these decks compete any higher than certain local tournaments--and even at that level, some cannot compete at all.  <strong><span>The Four Main Blue-Eyes Decks</span></strong>  At present, there are four generally accepted ways to build a Blue-Eyes deck: (1) Fusion, which is based around summoning Blue-Eyes fusion boss monsters like Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon; (2) Ritual, which aims to summon monsters like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon for an OTK; (3) Rank-8, which uses the Blue-Eyes archetype and engine to make powerful rank-8 XYZ monsters; and (4) Dragon Link, which uses the Blue-Eyes engine alongside more common dragon-based engines to combo into a typical DLink end-board that includes negates and interruptions along with powerful boss monsters. These four deck builds are not always rigid and often overlap, incorporating some elements of one or the other. Most Blue-Eyes players, for instance, run some type of rank-8 XYZ package in the extra-deck, even if it's not the deck's main focus. But in general, these are the four major types of Blue-Eyes decks in the current format.  Among these four, the ritual build is generally accepted as stronger than the fusion build. Whether it runs an Impcantation engine to turbo out its ritual monster, works Chaos MAX into Drytron, or sticks to the typical archetypal support, the ritual build seems to have an easier time getting its win condition onto the field than the fusion build does--though I should add, this may change significantly with the release of the Battle of Chaos support cards in February 2022. Blue-Eyes fans tend to prefer these two, no doubt owing partly to their appearances in the Duel Monsters anime.  While both can reliably pump out their boss monsters, they do so at an enormous cost. Beyond running the BEWD normal brick at x3--or perhaps because they do so--the decks have to run a certain amount of support cards that mitigate the risk of drawing an unplayable hand. But they also have to run enough searchers to get their Blue-Eyes pieces from deck to hand, field and/or graveyard. This leaves relatively little deck space for defense and disruption if the player aims to keep their deck size at or around 40 cards.  More issues soon arise. Under the right circumstances, both Chaos MAX and Alternative Ultimate Dragon can OTK their opponent--and if not, they can rampage through opponent's boards with their powerful effects and high attack. Both have some level of built-in protection too. But in the present-day meta-game, these are easily worked around since neither creature has the ability to negate anything. If the opponent succeeds in disrupting their play, it usually means the end of the game due to the player having committed so many resources in summoning the Blue-Eyes boss monsters in the first place.  <strong><span>'Brick-Eyes' White Dragon &amp; Card Economy</span></strong>  Since its victory at the 2016 YuGiOh World Championship, which itself was not without controversy, Blue-Eyes decks have remained outside the scope of competitive play in all but the local level. On a fundamental level, the deck's consistency will always suffer due to the Blue-Eyes White Dragon itself. As a level-8 normal monster with 3000 ATK / 2500 DEF, Kaiba's ace monster is just a beat-stick--solid stats but hardly unique among boss monsters. It requires two tributes to normal summon to the field, meaning it's not capable of starting plays. It also has no card effect. Other cards can <em>make use </em>of BEWD to start plays or extend the player's position (Trade-In and Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, respectively), but the vanilla BEWD is neither a starter nor an extender. It is an absolute brick that will simply sit in-hand if you fail to draw into the right card.  While YuGiOh has no direct analog to Magic the Gathering's mana economy, the game absolutely has a resource system. Resources in YuGiOh are the cards a player has access to using at any given time, whether in-hand, on-field, or in-grave. All other things being equal, the deck that generates greater card advantage than an opponent's deck is better situated to win. Card advantage generally represents more available options for making optimum plays and counter-moves. Pot of Greed is banned for this very reason. This concept is pretty YuGiOh-101, but it helps us understand the trouble with Blue-Eyes decks.  Running 3x BEWD equates to a more than 33% chance of seeing at least one of these cards in the opening five-card hand of a 40-card deck. In the likely event that a player draws into at least one unusable Blue-Eyes brick, they are beginning the round at a potential disadvantage (potential because the opponent can brick too). Drawing 1x BEWD in the opening five cards means that 20% of your available resources are unusable on their own as either starters or extenders. Perhaps the player draws into Trade-In, which upon activation essentially swaps 1x BEWD and 1x Trade-In for two new cards. In some sense, this generates additional resources in that seven (7) cards are now available in-hand or in-grave. It also thins the deck, boosting the probability of drawing into important extenders.  Trade-In is a good spell that Blue-Eyes decks consistently run at x3 for precisely this purpose. In another sense, however, both BEWD and Trade-In represent opportunity costs to the deck. For one, they both showed up in-hand rather than better starters or superior extenders. Trade-In essentially fixes a bricked hand by replacing an unusable card and itself with two new cards, one or both of which may be useful. Resolving Trade-In thus becomes a necessity for playing this hypothetical hand.  This highlights another opportunity cost more fundamental than the composition of the five-card hand. Blue-Eyes decks have an ever-compounding need to run cards that mitigate their decision to run 3x BEWDs in the first place. Any Blue-Eyes player who has ever drawn another copy of Trade-In from resolving Trade-In has experienced this principle firsthand. From jump street, running Blue-Eyes White Dragon forces the player to include cards that will 'fix' their hands in-place of other starters, extenders or defense/disruption like hand-traps. The rest of the deck bends in service of a (fairly useless) card, rather than the card serving the functionality of the rest of the deck. Generally this is a bad way to deck-build.  BEWD and Dark Magician stand out as anomalies in YuGiOh due to their immense ongoing popularity. Konami has built these vanilla, two-tribute monsters into entire archetypes with their own lineup of supporting monsters and extra-deck monsters, along with a suite of spells and traps. Both regularly receive new support aimed--with varying degrees of success--at bringing these Duel Monsters anime icons up to speed with the game's modern mechanics. Much of this support focuses on lowering the barrier to summoning these bricky, beloved boss monsters, while some has offered in-archetype cards that offer useful alternatives to work around the more fundamental weaknesses of these decks--like the aptly named Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon.  Debate rages on among the fanbase of both monsters as to what Konami would have to release to make these decks competitive in the meta. At the core, the question is, how does a deck running so many bricks--remember, cards like Alternative White Dragon are bricks in-hand too without an accompanying BEWD to summon--and dedicating so much space to mitigating the bricks become consistent and powerful enough to compete? My own thoughts fall outside the scope of this already-long deck profile. But the contradictions presented in this question are why I maintain that, at present, the Dragon Link build is the strongest, most consistent way to run a Blue-Eyes deck.  <span><strong>Dragons of Dr. Moreau: Crossing Blue-Eyes with Dragon Link</strong></span>  Here's how the deck primarily works:  The Blue-Eyes engine runs alongside the other two main Dragon Link engines: Rokkets and Chaos Dragons. Through exploiting the White Stone of Legend's mandatory search effect, which triggers when sent to the graveyard, the player simultaneously builds a board, adds the 3x Blue-Eyes White Dragon to hand and, by removing these bricks, boosts the deck's draw consistency. Once in-hand, the 3x BEWD bricks become part of the deck's resource system, generating even greater card advantage and thus overcoming a major obstacle facing Blue-Eyes decks. The watershed moment happens when Saryuja Skull Dread is summoned using four (4) monsters as link material, resulting in the player drawing four (4) new cards and placing three (3) at the bottom of the deck. In essence, the player draws just shy of a second opening hand and has up to 3x BEWDs to put back into the deck, allowing them to grab critical extenders and disruption to build and defend their board while lowering the probability of drawing into bricks on future turns.  <span><strong>The Core Combo</strong></span>  The ideal opening hand consists of 1x Sage with Eyes of Blue and 1x Melody of Awakening Dragon. Barring disruption, the combo looks like this: <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Sage with Eyes of Blue. Activate its effect to search the White Stone of Legend.</li>  	<li>Activate Melody of Awakening Dragon, pitching the White Stone of Legend for cost. The White Stone should be arranged as chain link-2 and resolve first, adding 1x BEWD to hand. Melody is chain link-1 and resolves after by the player adding 1x Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon and 1x Chaos Dragon Levianeer to hand.</li>  	<li>Special summon Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon by revealing BEWD in-hand. If going second, the player can activate Alternative's effect to pop a monster if appropriate since it will not be used in the Battle Phase.</li>  	<li>Link off Sage + Alternative to link summon Crystron Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Activate Halq's effect to special summon a second copy of the White Stone of Legend.</li>  	<li>Link off the White Stone of Legend to summon Striker Dragon to the bottom-right zone beneath Halq. White Stone's effect searches and adds 1x BEWD to hand.</li>  	<li>Activate Striker Dragon's effect to search Boot Sector Launch and add to hand.</li>  	<li>Special summon Chaos Dragon Levianeer to the main monster zone furthest away from Halq by banishing three (3) light monsters from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>On summon, activate Levianeer's effect to bring back one of the White Stones in the graveyard in defense mode.</li>  	<li>Link off the White Stone to summon Guardragon Pisty to the bottom-left zone beneath Halq. White Stone's effect searches and adds 1x BEWD to hand.</li>  	<li>Activate Pisty's effect to bring back one of the White Stones from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Link off Halq, Striker Dragon, Pisty and the White Stone to summon Saryuja Skull Dread.</li> </ul> From here, the player can arrange the chain links to fit the situation. If Saryuja's effect is chain link-1, the White Stone will have no valid targets to search and not resolve. If the White Stone is chain link-1, however, Saryuja's effect resolves first and the player will draw four (4) cards and then select three (3) to place at the bottom of the deck. If 1+x BEWDs are placed in the deck by Saryuja's effect, the White Stone's effect will resolve and add one (1) of the copies of BEWD <em>that you just placed at the bottom of the deck </em>back to your hand. This means that even if having a BEWD in-hand is useful for activating cards like Trade-In, you should still generally put them back and take advantage of the White Stone's effect trigger by arranging your chain links to resolve this way.  If all three (3) copies of BEWD are in-hand at the time of Saryuja's summon, the White Stone's effect will not resolve and cannot chain-block so you mind as well make it chain link-1. Occasionally, however, you may get to Saryuja with one or more copies of BEWD still in the deck, in which case the White Stone's effect can chain-block to protect Saryuja's draw effect from disruption.  Depending on the opening hand, Chaos Space can act as a partial replacement for Melody if one if drawn but not the other. After all, it can search and add either Chaos Dragon Levianeer <strong><em>or </em></strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, and it can pitch any light or dark monster (White Stone of Legend) as cost. One of the handful of DLink mechanics that actually works a bit <em>better </em>with the Blue-Eyes engine is searching monsters off Chaos Space. Typically, a Dragon Link deck runs two (2) dark and one (1) light monsters that cannot be normal summoned/set: Black Dragon Collapserpent and Chaos Dragon Levianeer, and White Dragon Wyverburster, respectively. Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon adds an additional light target to resolve Chaos Space, especially in later turns after the White Dragon Wyverburster has been banished or sent to the graveyard. Without a valid target in-deck, Chaos Space can sometimes clog a Dragon Link player's hand and prevent them from gaining the additional draw off its second effect in-grave. But Blue-Eyes Dragon Link will almost never find itself without a target to resolve Chaos Space.  <span><strong>Building the End Board</strong></span>  <span><strong>Rank-8 XYZ Dragons</strong></span>  With the hand replenished, the graveyard loaded up and a Link-4, 2800-ATK dragon with additional effects on the field, the player sets to work building a board consisting of powerful rank-8 XYZ and synchro dragons. In general, making some of these pieces takes priority over others. For instance, when going first, this deck almost never wants to make Number 97: Draglubion or use its effect--and in the rare instance it does, it <strong><em>never</em></strong> wants to make Number 100: Numeron Dragon via its effect. Making Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy is a much bigger priority due to its spell negate and attack re-direction during battle, though I'll admit I've never successfully resolved the second effect in practice.  Number 97: Draglubion accesses one of two win conditions for the deck: Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon and Number 100: Numeron Dragon. When going second, Draglubion should make one of these two XYZ dragons via its effect, attaching the other as material. Numeron Dragon can detach material to gain ATK equal to the ranks of all XYZ monsters on the field x1000, meaning it will generally have 9000 ATK or more. In those rare instances in which deck can make Number 38 and Number 97 on the same turn, it will have 17,000 ATK. Whatever monster Draglubion summons by effect becomes the only monster that can attack for the turn, but if Numeron Dragon successfully attacks, it will OTK or nearly OTK the opponent on its own.  At 0 ATK / 0 DEF, Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon is less straightforward. It cannot be destroyed by battle, sure, but the opponent takes any and all battle damage incurred by this card. In other words, if the opponent has an 8000 ATK Gren Maju Da Eiza on the field and Heart-eartH Dragon declares an attack on it, it will OTK the opponent. But Heart-eartH Dragon has an equally broken effect in the end phase of the opponent's turn: it can detach a material to banish all monsters, spells and traps the opponent summoned or set that turn. If the opponent destroy it with card effects while it still has material, however, it just special summons itself from the graveyard with +1000 ATK for each card currently banished--meaning cards banished by both players. Bringing out Heart-earth Dragon is like activating a time-bomb, which your opponent must carefully disarm in one turn or face annihilation.  This deck can only make Numeron Dragon or Heart-eartH Dragon via Draglubion's effect, and since one must serve as material for the other, the player generally must choose one or the other. Numeron's a simpler OTK machine to operate but offers fewer options in the event of contingencies, while Heart-eartH works better in more complex situations with its equally devastating arsenal of effects.  In general, the rank-8 dragons are quite easy to make. Galactic Spiral Dragon (level-8) can special summon itself from hand <strong><em>or </em></strong>graveyard, making it an ideal card to pitch as cost for something like Trade-In and an easy body to get on-board. Once summoned, it can activate its effect at any time to make all face-up monsters on the player's side of the field level-8 monsters. While activating this effect too early can screw up the synchro plays (discussed below), it makes summoning Hope Harbinger, Draglubion or both quite easy. And if it's attached as XYZ material and later detached, Galactic Spiral Dragon will return to the graveyard instead of banishing itself, setting up its triumphant return to the field on the next turn.  <span><strong>Synchro Dragons: Blue-Eyes &amp; Otherwise</strong></span>  When it comes to synchro monsters, on the other hand, the deck generally wants to make Chaos Ruler and resolve its effect to excavate five (5) cards and add a light or dark monster to their hand. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can then be synchro-summoned using Chaos Ruler and whatever level-1 tuner is available, giving the player an omni-negate and 3200-ATK body on-board--and one that special summons a tuner from the graveyard when it deals battle damage, at that. When in the GY, Chaos Ruler can special summon itself by banishing 1 light and 1 dark monster, which is a remarkably easy condition for this deck to meet. As a level-8 synchro, Chaos Ruler can easily become XYZ material for a rank-8. This move circumvents Chaos Ruler's restriction, which banishes the card when it leaves the field a second time, and when it detaches as XYZ material, it simply returns to the graveyard for the cycle to begin again next turn.  When I competed with this deck, I did not include either Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon in the extra deck. These cards simply do not do enough in the modern game to warrant space in an already-tight extra deck. Instead, I played a second copy of Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres and 1x Borreload Dragon (link-4). Frankly, I don't think this was optimal either. If I had to pilot this deck again today, I'd play Baronne de Fleur instead, which is relatively easy to make off of Hot Red's battle effect.  However, I included the two Blue-Eyes synchros, both level-9, in this profile because of the common criticism that Blue-Eyes Dragon Link isn't a true Blue-Eyes deck. That criticism strikes me as begging the question since this deck runs all the key main-deck elements of a Blue-Eyes deck as we understand them today. Nevertheless, if I were to slot in extra-deck Blue-Eyes monsters, these two make the most sense. Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon, especially, can prove very useful in certain matchups. Spirit Dragon's prohibition on summoning two or more monsters simultaneously, for example, stops Tri-Brigade Revolt from resolving. Similarly, its graveyard effect negate--not a hard-once-per-turn, either--finds itself well-suited for the current format, in which a slew of meta-decks activate key parts of their engine in-grave.  Azure-Eyes is harder to make and generally less useful, offering very limited protection from card effects to other dragons already on the field when it is summoned. The two cards are generally played together for Spirit Dragon's tag-in, tag-out quick effect, since Azure-Eyes' effect prevents Spirit Dragon's restriction (the special-summoned light synchro-dragon is destroyed during the player's next end phase) from resolving. I cannot think of a situation in which one would make Azure-Eyes over Spirit Dragon if given the choice.  <span><strong>Linking Off</strong></span>  When I played this deck, blowout cards like Accesscode Talker had nary a reprint in sight. It goes to say, I'd probably play something like that as my link-4 boss monster over Borrelsword Dragon if I built the deck today today.  But Borrelsword is still a damn fine card. Typical Dragon Link decks don't make Borrelsword as often as they did in previous formats, but it remains a strong blowout card to bring out and end the game quickly. With the amount of rank-8 plays available to this deck, I think Blue-Eyes Dragon Link would make Borrelsword even less often. Nevertheless, it's the condom principle: I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Borreload Dragon works just fine too, albeit differently, and running both gives the player the benefit of choosing the best fit for a particular situation. However, the general consensus prefers Borrelsword and running both in an already tight extra-deck seems excessive and unnecessary.  Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres is one of the best cards available to dragon decks in general. For one, it guarantees a follow-up play after getting Nibiru'ed. I don't think Blue-Eyes uses it very effectively on its own because so few of the monsters in the main deck search or add extenders on-summon. Thus, I ran the Dragonmaid package--1x Chamber Dragonmaid, 2x Dragonmaid Tidying. Chamber Dragonmaid is the best target to special summon off of Spheres' tribute effect and at just one (1) copy, you're unlikely to see it when you don't want to see it. When Chamber hits the field, it adds the Tidying trap to hand. While in-grave, Tidying can banish itself to special summon Chamber Dragonmaid from hand or graveyard, allowing another search/add for the other copy of Tidying. The trap itself offers great disruption in the form of a non-targeting bounce, making it a natural analog to Spheres' disruption effect. Blue-Eyes decks usually bank on the OTK attack, but Spheres and the Dragonmaid package add an easy-to-access, potentially devastating element of disruption to the deck.  <span><strong>'Do I have to run Rokkets?' : A Few Last Points</strong></span>  In a word, yes. This deck runs about as minimal a Rokket package as you'll find, but the benefits of a zero-cost starter like Quick Launch are just too great to give one damn about remaining faithful to the Blue-Eyes archetype. Since the basic combo requires going through Striker Dragon, too, better to plus off its effect by adding Boot Sector Launch to hand. If you make Striker with a Rokket too, he can recycle that same Rokket back to your hand to special summon again via Boot Sector.  Rokket Tracer's effect is equally outrageous, though it must be activated with care in this build. Tracer can pop any card on your field to special summon another Rokket from the deck, which allows it to singlehandedly make Chaos Ruler (Rokket Recharger) or set up extended plays requiring a level-1 tuner (Rokket Synchron). However, activating this effect locks the player into only summoning dark monsters from the extra-deck for the remainder of the turn. Considering dark monsters comprise only about half of the extra-deck, this should be activated only after making Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres or whatever light monsters the player plans to summon.  This restriction is the single greatest breakdown in synergy between Blue-Eyes and Dragon Link as a deck. In typical Dragon Link decks, making Spheres is the only serious consideration before using Tracer's effect. Unfortunately, Blue-Eyes and its associated monsters are, with one or two exceptions, a light archetype--as are many of the staple rank-8 XYZ dragons, like Hope Harbinger. This means players will often be unable to optimally use Tracer's pop-summon effect. Other Rokkets, like Rokket Synchron and the recently released Rokket Caliber, have similar loyalties to dark-attribute monsters, making them uncomfortable fits alongside the ultimate creature of destruction. But while the partnership is uncomfortable, the Rokket engine and its ability to start and extend boards is just too powerful to excise, even from Blue-Eyes Dragon Link. There's literally nothing else quite like it (yet).  The contradiction between the Blue-Eyes and Rokket engines find its synthesis in the Chaos Dragon engine: the black and white level-4s, Chaos Dragon Levianeer and 3x Chaos Space. Starliege Seyfert--probably the best single starter in any conceivable dragon deck at the moment--rounds out the package with its incredible search capacity and extender-effect in-grave, which synergizes perfectly with the larger-than-average amount of level-8 dragons in this deck. The Chaos cards make use of the light and dark attribute dragons--and when they can't use one, they can swap them out for another they can use.  <strong>No Dragon Ravine? No Romulus?</strong>  It's Blue-Eyes Dragon Link. There's no space in the deck to run the typical Dragon Link engine card-for-card. One of the casualties here is Dragunity Knight - Romulus and the field spell it searches, Dragon Ravine. I found that making Rom before Saryuja ended with a fragmented, half-built board that ran out of gas before it could establish itself. Making Rom after Saryuja, on the other hand, was practically pointless--I had all the extenders I needed to build a solid board. Without Rom, Dragon Ravine becomes a one-of destined to get lost in the main deck and pop up at inconveniently inconsistent times. It's essential in Dragon Link, but I don't think it works with the Blue-Eyes engine.  <strong>No REDMD?</strong>  Originally I ran this deck with 1x Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and 1x Black Metal Dragon, the latter searching the former when sent from field to grave. No doubt REDMD is a powerful extender that typical Dragon Link decks run as a staple. After enough rounds with this deck, however, it became clear that I'd almost never normal summon Black Metal Dragon and link it off to search the big boy. The deck has plenty of normal summons, most of which are far more essential to the core combo than REDMD. Black Metal Dragon's stipulation that it must leave the field for the grave for its effect to activate also makes it poor discard fodder. But without the search, REDMD never shows up consistently enough in-hand to make an impact on the match. I couldn't care less about fealty to the anime, which seems to animate (no pun intended) a bizarre amount of Blue-Eyes players. If REDMD boosts a deck's consistency and power, you should run it. Put simply, it didn't so I didn't.  <span><strong>When the 'most-competitive-possible' still can't compete: Final Thoughts</strong></span>  After building both the fusion and ritual Blue-Eyes decks, I'm certain that Dragon Link is the most competitively viable way to play Blue-Eyes in the current format. Purists who, bafflingly enough, still haven't gotten the memo that all the Eyes with Blue tuners--with the notable exception of Sage--are too situational to play, will often balk at running a DLink build. Over half the cards in here have no direct connection to the archetype--and some have no connection at all. But this deck isn't for players who mainly enjoy casual games against similarly powered, casual decks. I arrived here after building the other BEWD decks and learning through practical experience that they simply couldn't compete--and more importantly, <em>why </em>they couldn't compete. Casual play is fine. I wanted to play competitively, however. Shedding most of the Blue-Eyes cards was a slow process for me (documented in the Rank-8 Dragon Link deck profile from last month), but there's no doubt the deck improved--and crucially so did I.  That all being said, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link is still not a competitive deck beyond the local level. The core issue of bricks remains in place. Blue-Eyes Dragon Link works better than other deck builds because it converts the archetype's signature disadvantage--the 33% chance of seeing at least one (1) dead-brick, vanilla BEWD in any given five-card opening hand--into an advantage in the form of drawing more cards. If you can get this resource system online and working, it can generate very strong boards and win against decks out of its league.  There's the rub, though: <em>if</em> this resource system gets online. With Guardragon Elpy banned, Blue-Eyes Dragon Link has a far more linear combo path than typical Dragon Link decks, making it extremely fragile and open to disruption. I found that the deck played decently through one mid-level disruption, like Ash Blossom, if I had at least one superior extender in-hand. More than that, I'd have to try to scramble into a playable board before running out of options. Failing to make Saryuja with four (4) materials blows a major hole in the strategy, and the setup itself is requires at least two of the optimal combo-starters to show up in the opening hand.  This leads to another point: What's the optimum size for a Blue-Eyes deck? Conventional wisdom would say, decks are better and more consistent at 40-cards. But that isn't always the case. A deck like Blue-Eyes, any variety, that runs as many bricks--searchable bricks, at that--as it does will draw into those bricks at a higher frequency as the total card count drops. As such, I don't think any Blue-Eyes deck should run 40 cards. On the other hand, while a larger deck lowers the probability of drawing Blue-Eyes, it also lowers the probability of drawing any other particular card--let alone combinations of two different cards. These two elements of deck-building--consistency through lower card counts and consistency through diluting potential bricks--are in contradiction with one another.  The answer isn't necessarily a middle ground, although I found that to generally work in this case. 45 cards in the main deck lowers the probability of a Blue-Eyes opening draw--and especially a multiple BEWD draw--enough to actually boost the deck's mathematical consistency. However, going above 45 resulted in almost never seeing Sage + Melody in the opening hand either. I think 43-45 represents the ideal size of a Blue-Eyes Dragon Link deck, which leaves plenty of room in smaller builds for another set of hand-traps or other tech.  So long as YuGiOh continues, players will continue flocking to Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Dark Magician. We should expect Konami to continue releasing support, both to meet existing demand from fans and to draw former players like me back into the game. Frankly, I think both offer great re-entry points into modern YuGiOh for returning players--the outrageously high cost of Dark Magician support aside. All it goes to say is, 'the optimum Blue-Eyes deck build' is not set in (white) stone. The collective game experience of many thousands of players will determine what works best in practice.  &nbsp;"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami.

""Magikey"" (魔ま鍵けん Maken) is an archetype introduced in Dawn of Majesty. The Japanese name is a combination of the kanji for demon/magic (""魔"") and key (""鍵"") which together form a homophone for ""Demon Sword"" (""魔剣""). The names of the ""Magikey"" Ritual Monsters and Extra Deck monsters are derived from the devils belonging to ""Solomon's 72 Pillars"".  Strategy for this deck :  1. You can use effect from ""Magnificent Magikey Mafteal"" to gain normal summon magikey monster after your synchro summon ""Borreload Savage Dragon"".  2. If your opponent activate Nibiru from their hand before your summon ""Borreload Savage Dragon"", you can still synchro summon ""Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine"" by use ""Magnificent Magikey Mafteal"" and level 4 normal monster as synchro material.

The difference is that the Dragoon package has been swapped out for the arguably better Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer package. Aside from being an auto-include in a lot of meta decks, DPE has great synergy with the deck; you can use it to pop your own Baby's, or if the DPE makes it through an opponent's turn without using its effect, attempt to pop the token on your opponent's side of the field and get a Lost World trigger.  The game plan is to end turn 1 on a board of Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer, your choice of rank 4 (usually one of the Evolzars but Abyss Dweller is good too), a Solemn Judgement if you've drawn it, and a surplus Predaplant Verte Anaconda. You can do this with extreme consistency.  Turn 2, if all your monsters have survived you can use the Anaconda, the likely depleted rank 4, and your normal summon for the turn to go into Access Code Talker, via Knightmare Unicorn.  I prefer this build to the Scrap Dinosaur Deck. The end board of the Destiny build isn't as strong as the Scrap build, but I find the Destiny build is more consistent, plays more easily under an Artefact Lancea, and is a little more flexible.  You've got a lot of flexibility in the extra deck. Aside from DPE, Link Kuriboh and Anaconda you could change any card in the extra deck for whatever fits your taste. I've included Castelle as an out to Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops because this deck can do nothing else against that card. I like having the Tornado Dragon for Mystic Mine opponents (this deck is actually really good against Mine as you can use Lost World to gradually increase the number of monsters on your opponent's field.) I like having the instant fusion package as Millenium Eyes restrict can give you some cover from hand traps, until you get to Miscellaneousaurus, and you can later link it off for Anaconda."

This doesn't use your normal summon so use the Dragonmaid engine with that to get out Sheou. You can pitch Dragonmaids (especially Tidying from hand) with Ravine during the Remus combo to set up your Dragonmaid engine. With this, you can relatively consistently end on Crystial Wing + Spheres + Sheou, usually with 1 trap/handtrap (hopefully more) and the plus 2 on opponents standby phase with Sheou for the follow up. Without opening Remus you can usually do the same thing minus the Crystal wing and save resources for the crackback.  <span><strong>Techs:</strong></span>  <strong>Arma Gram</strong> midgame can be deadly, you can easily get it off of Ravine, and it fuses into Sheou.  <strong>Cataclysm</strong> is optional but I find the that the deck lacks an ability to pop cards and usually has little dragons laying around on the field as fodder for this card.  <strong>AreadBhair</strong> can be summed by normal summoning Remus with any level 8 Dragonmaid on board. It doesn't come up too often, but it's definitely let me come back from games I shouldn't have more often than you would expect.  <strong>I:P and Closed World </strong>is one of the best techs this format if you play a deck that summons a lot and has the extra deck space. Remus locks you out of it, so arguably its better in the Dragon Link version, but this comes up in turns 3 and 4.  &nbsp;"

Versatile build tha","Build and deck profile information below constructed by Ou Ki, Swordsoul Master from Nexus.  Definitive meta Swordsoul Deck. I've tested pretty much all the other swordsoul decks on here and frankly they either brick far too much/ lose out on hand traps (phoenix builds) or they end up screwing themselves over (Desire builds) by banishing their combo pieces/ bricking due to ratios. Even if you run 3x the standard copies of swordsoul monsters, you're often going to banish 2 of a combo piece (I've even had games testing that popular build on here where I banished all 3 of my mo-ye off of a mediocre turn 1 draw, effectively GGing myself before even playing the game.)  Prosperity build instead of Desires would be nice if it didn't kill any other draws, ruining the synergy available with mo ye + Qixing Long Yuan. Also, you don't want to run 3x of the swordsouls because you don't want to see taia turn 1 (unless your build is setup differently to specifically go that route first, but most aren't - and the desire builds do this because they have to, which often nets you dreadful hands due to lacking control over ratios.)  I've beaten every swordsoul deck I've played against with this profile because unlike the other builds on here, I actually have ways to achieve full lockdown and easy options for breaking a massive board if I go 2nd. None of the other builds on here run DRNM or Droplet either -- I can tell you right now they're not fighting through my field of 5+ negates without crossout or ruler (Which the most popular build on here doesn't run.) Phoenix is also worthless if you can't make it. Any of the games I played I either ash'd their destiny fusion or negated verte before he was even fielded. Often times too if you're running 3x destiny fusion you'll draw into two which can be back breaking, especially if it's negated. Those decks are fun if you're playing casually, but if you want to win and contend vs the meta they're unreliable.  Without further adieu, let me get into this profile.  First things first, the major difference between this deck and the other swordsoul builds is I want to end my turn 1 with 2 lv 10 syncros instead of just 1 + I wanted options for how I use those 10s in tandem with the rest of my syncro package (which the standard swordsoul build can't achieve and didn't have). The rest of my deck is constructed in a way where if I draw into crossout or am go 2nd DRNM, I don't need to go baronne for my starter combo off longyuan to play around nibiru and can make cheng ying -- this is a luxury the standard Swordsoul build on here doesn't have (Because they don't run crossout nor DRNM nor resonator).  On top of this, because we're running resonator it opens the door for a bunch of other combos that aren't in the other builds. Let me present a few of the combos below and explain why its so devastating. (I won't go into the standard combos because I feel like they're obvious and everyone knows them and for the most part it's the same here - I'm just going to discuss below some of the unique aspects we can do here with the right hands factoring in what resonator brings to the table.):  <strong><span>Combo 1</span></strong>: <em>Resonator + Mo Ye + Long Yuan + any swordsoul card ((4 card combo))</em>  <span>1A. This is if you have crossout in hand:</span> <ol>  	<li>Summon Long Yuan + token. (by discarding the other swordsoul card you have in hand. If its emergence, search taia then discard him instead.)</li>  	<li>Syncro into Qixing Long Yuan.</li>  	<li>summon resonator + mo ye. Mo ye activates, make token.</li>  	<li>Turn Mo ye + token into chixiao. activate both effects, search + draw 1. (Search swordsoul sacred summit.)</li>  	<li> Draw another +1 since this activates Qixing Long Yuan's effect.</li>  	<li>Turn Chixiao + resonator into Cheng Ying. (Field so far = Cheng Ying + Qixing Long Yuan)</li>  	<li> Draw another +1 since this activates Qixing Long Yuan's effect.</li>  	<li>Use Swordsoul sacred summit to revive Chixiao. Turn 1 field = Chixiao / Cheng Ying / Qixing Long Yuan + you've +3'd off the draws of mo ye + 2x qixing long yuan and had a search from chixiao. Off these draws I almost always draw into hand traps based on the structure of my deck.</li> </ol> <span>1B. This is if you don't have crossout in hand / get a sense your opponent is readying hand traps.</span> <ol>  	<li>Summon Long Yuan + Token.</li>  	<li>Syncro into Baronne de Fleur. (We go baronne instead to protect from Nibiru.)</li>  	<li>Normal resonator + mo ye. proceed same as combo above, make Chixiao and search sacred summit and draw 1.</li>  	<li>Syncro resonator+chixiao into cheng ying.</li>  	<li>Use summit to revive Chixiao. Field = Baronne + Cheng Ying + Chixiao.</li> </ol> <span><strong>Combo 2</strong></span>: <em>Going 2nd Board breaking Combo ( resonator + ecclesia + mo ye + DRNM) ((4 card combo)) </em>  **This combo can be done with resonator+mo ye (2 card combo) but this is best case scenario I'm describing. <ol>  	<li>Use Dark Ruler no more to negate the field.</li>  	<li>special summon ecclesia.</li>  	<li>If you can manipulate swordsoul emergence to GY, special out taia from ecclesia &lt;&lt; if you cannot, then you'd special out mo ye and prefer to start with taia in hand instead.</li>  	<li>Use taia's ability to banish swordsoul emergence to raise the token level to 5.</li>  	<li>Syncro Shenshen.</li>  	<li>normal summon resonator + mo ye.</li>  	<li>Mo ye + token into white whale, destroy all attack position monsters (Due to Shenshen, they all get banished instead of going to GY). ((This is especially of note if your opponents monsters have GY activatable effects, like Shaddoll. You don't need to go this route if they don't, but if you can you should.)</li>  	<li>From here we use resonator + white whale to make cheng ying (or baronne depending on what you feel works best at this game state.)</li>  	<li>Field = Shenshen + Cheng Ying ( or Baronne.) Entire enemy field wiped, and if it isn't you can clear the defense position monsters with white whale before syncroing.</li> </ol> <span>Some other notable Resonator combos:</span> <ul>  	<li>resonator + taia can baxia, pop 2, pop resonator to bring back ecclesia for a mo ye combo, or instead after popping a useless card (like an unused crossout or DRNM that wasn't used) to revive you can syncro baxia + resonator into a 10. Also have the option of going into a fibrax play as well.</li>  	<li>resonator + taia can also Crimson blader (taia+token into crimson blader), battle phase and lock them out of normal/specialing lv 5 or higher then after battle phase resonator + Crimson blader into a level 10.</li>  	<li>resonator + white whale DRNM combo above.</li>  	<li>This build allows for you to make Ruddy + Cheng Ying on the same turn, which can be an OTK in most late game scenarios.</li> </ul> <span>Some other notable comments:</span> <ul>  	<li>Fibrax+Syncron engine can be interchangeable with Dingirsu/Zeus or Draglubion/Number 100 however in my testing I've found it very useful in tandem with baxia combos (mo ye is typically in GY but without SS in hand he cant pyramid into combos) in these instances u can fibrax into syncron + baxia to make a 10. The draw often gets you an extra handtrap which is why I've liked it. Ding/Zeus is really nice but super situational, and the draglubion strat is overkill here especially with how easily we can OTK other ways.</li>  	<li>We run 2x Cosmic Cyclone because it synergizes with Cheng Ying + banishing some of the meta spells/traps is a lot more useful right now especially against decks like Floowandereeze, Eldlich, Shaddoll, etc. Harpies feather duster isn't good enough here especially since we really struggle against these particular decks that CC actually is strong against.</li>  	<li>Imperial Order is busted and if you need to use spells, you can pop it with baronne or baxia.</li>  	<li>Called by also synergizes with Cheng Ying and activates his effect. It and Cosmic cyclone are a must in this deck.</li>  	<li>2x Baxia &gt; 1x baxia 1x yazi in this build. The combos with resonator and the ease of access for GY revive's just gives them a lot more utility here. If you have to start the game going 2nd with 1, it's really nice to have a 2nd later for recycling combo pieces / rebuilding your board.</li>  	<li>2x cheng ying because we get it out a lot turn 1 (Which the other swordsoul builds typically don't to get around Nibiru). If it gets outed, you really want to be able to make a 2nd one again. Not having it for a lengthy game can be troublesome to overcome, especially against decks with tons of GY recycling activatables.</li>  	<li>DRNM Crossout and some of your other spells if unused at later gamestate may seem dead in some decks, but due to Baxia they often times are able to get discarded for a revive, saving you an extra body or monster card that is needed (like resonator)</li>  	<li>You can play with the ratio's a bit. I liked dropping Ecclesia to 2x because it's dead if you go 1st and due to the structure of my build, I really want to see swordsouls / wyrms to playmake. Drawing into it on a turn 2/3 is ideal and exactly how it's worked for this build.</li>  	<li>2x ash 2x veiler gets you to 40 but 3x ash imo has been ideal - You really want to see it especially if you aren't going 1st. If you want to trim to 40 and want 3x ecclesia, you can cut ghost bell and drop the ss trap to 2x.</li>  	<li>Crossout absolutely owns the mirror matchup.</li>  	<li>The only disadvantage on paper I have vs. the standard swordsoul build is I don't run psy omega, which isn't that big a deal if they go 1st, but in those instances Ill sub it in and replace ghostbell + the 2 cosmic cyclones with it (2x psy 1x brick) so its live for crossout (none of the standard builds of SS run bell.)</li>  	<li>Qixing Long Yuan is underrated. 2 negates that banish can be incredibly useful depending on the matchup; for example, this card annihilates eldlich. Eldlich is banished / cant revive himself from GY + all his traps that try to activate are banished, can't use their GY effects. amazing vs. Shaddoll traps and their fusions. With how my field is structured, he's typically out there with Cheng ying and Chixiao which makes his field presence even stronger. The reason most standard builds don't run him is he isn't that good alone with Chixiao by himself. You'd much rather have cheng ying or even Baronne -- that's why I feel this deck is a lot more versatile especially with the potential draw combos he offers with the right hand.</li>  	<li>If you want to trim from 41 to 40 you can cut ghost bell or drop ash to 2 (or replace 2x cosmic cyclone with 1x harpies feather duster.) In my testing though I've found these ratios to be as tight to my liking as possible and 3x ash is essential in this meta.</li> </ul> <span>Side deck comments:</span> <ul>  	<li>Droll for the fluffal / drytron matchup</li>  	<li>psy omega reasoning mentioned above, for the mirror</li>  	<li>token collector also for the mirror</li>  	<li>lancea destroys dino / invoked, etc.</li>  	<li>yazi a situational insert depending on how I feel matches are going. (Psy lambda can be slotted here as well if you run the omega package- in that case you'd want to run syncro 8 omega as well.)</li>  	<li>Ding+Zeus insert for the Fibrax/Syncron swap out.</li> </ul>"

Well, using the power of one of my favorite cores to play in Trinity Format, I have got just the solution for you! Presenting: Shaddoll Monarch aka ""Dollnarch""  <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Shaddolls</span>: Even without committing to a Fusion package, the Shaddolls in this deck are capable of cycling through the deck, serving as tribute fodder, establishing loops, getting around disruption, and being disruption and/or removal in the right circumstances. Due to their accessibility being so high, they also make the deck able to brick on big guys and eventually convert into them no problem just because of all of the ways to them!</li>  	<li><span>Copiuous Revival</span>: The deck lives and dies by having tribute fodder and what better way to do that than to summon during the opponent's turn? Since everything tends to just be floaters or setting up for intricate combo lines, you're on basically all of the good revival, then all the playable revival afterwards. The GY is your best friend here, but you don't exactly want to mill to get there, you just want to reuse some of the playmakers from before.</li>  	<li><span>Extra Deck</span>: While Domain and Erupt are banned alongside other floodgates like Majesty's Fiend and Vanity's Fiend, the deck will use the Extra Deck quite a bit as it's super resourceful, always there, and allows you to catch the opponent by surprise in a number of ways. The Crossrose package given for basically free courtesy of the Baobaboon package, Sheridan thanks to any normal Monarch + a steal, or just 2 Monarchs, and lastly, Omega to endlessly make use of Pantheism, Edea, and Eidos to the point where you probably will run out of targets for each of the former at some point.</li> </ul> <strong>Cons:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Monarchs</span>: The major downside of the Monarchs is obviously the fact that due to their level, they can clog up the hand and brick pretty often. Fortunately, we are on Ultimate Offering and Escalation to try and get around that, alongside playing all that's required to get us the win; however, a Monarch can and should be expected to sit in the hand for a while. Most situations regarding them, especially in the case of Ehther, should be concerning how to navigate the gamestate to best make use of them in a way that spins the game in your favor, rather than just deciding to discard them for something like a Shaddoll Beast or Knightmare play. They are the powerhouses of the deck. This is the consequence of playing them. You knew what you were getting into.</li>  	<li><span>Restrictions for Days</span>:  Keep track of the restrictions you'll find yourself under. The good effects of the Vassals will all lock you from the Extra Deck, just having Return up on field will prevent ED usage as well (though Kuraz can get us out of that pickle), and Glow-Up Bloom will prevent any special summons for the rest of the turn except for that of Zombie Monsters, which we're not really on here. Sequencing will matter a lot, so be careful and manage the restrictions appropriately. You will be rewarded for your approach.</li> </ul> Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.  <hr />  <strong>OPENERS</strong>  The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally want to get your engines rolling. This can be enabled by the following: <ul>  	<li><strong>Enabling Return:</strong> You'll mostly just be grabbing Ehther here, but if you already have Ehther access, the next best target would be either Caius or Raiza. You don't want to commit to them unless you have to with the main reason being the chance of getting Tenacity. Your entire deck tutors itself, especially with the help of Ehther, so Return should mostly be used strategically more than it should be used to snowball and fill your hand with a bunch of bricks. Unless you have Mithra or Offering up, you aren't getting that many summons in the turn anyway. If Return ever gets in your way, you'll just clear it with Kuraz. Just make sure to order your chain link such that the search from Return always is later in the chain. You'll grab a Monarch and get the free draw.</li>  	<li><strong>Shaddoor is Open:</strong> You'll start by sending Wendi and summoning Falco. The reason we go for Falco over Beast or Hog here is because during the opponent's turn, they're going to have to out the Falco anyway. If they don't, we start our next turn with two monsters in a deck that Tribute Summons, one of which is a tuner and tuners are <em>scary</em>. If they attack into the Falco, you get back the Wendi, then use the Wendi to get either Beast or Hog depending on your need. Usually I go for Hog just so I get Reshhaddoll Incarnation in rotation. You won't be looping it like you would in a Fusion Shaddol strategy, but it's a searchable Reborn that can also double as a reset for certain setups or making a Flip Effect happen at Fast Speed. This will mostly show its head with Dragon and Squamata, but drawing four cards with Beast isn't anything to scoff at either.</li>  	<li><strong>The Classic:</strong> This one is purely based on the Monarch you've been given in the opening hand, but the typical Edea into Eidos opener is a fine play to use. We've got two Edea in the deck anyway just to make use of that line more often in addition to the resets from the banish effect. If you have any <em>Edea</em> how Monarchs work, you'll need to make sure you plan when to Tribute her and use Eidos' GY effect accordingly. It could be potentially game losing.</li> </ul> From the above lines, it's clear to see that the openings usually won't overlap that often outside of permutations granted by Ehther when she descends from the hand. It's for this reason that the deck will take some getting used to at first. Not every hand will play nicely into a starter you're familiar with.  <strong>MIDGAME AND BEYOND </strong>  Since you'll be drawing cards, cycling through the deck, and searching just about every name in the dictionary, the midgame gamestates will mostly come down to your discretion. Be mindful of the things that you are in total control of. If your opener gave you Ehther or Return, there's next to no excuse to not be in a winning position. <ul>  	<li><strong>Ehther the Heavenly Monarch:</strong> She has a lot of lines, so I can't really get into all of them here. Just remember, you can summon a second copy of her from your deck on your own turn to have for the opponent's turn to do this again but for a disruption Monarch like Kuraz or Seleglare. Ehther can also be used to grab your setup for next turn if the opponent can't keep up with your pressure.</li>  	<li><strong>Vampire Grimson: </strong>Alternative target for Glow-Up Bloom. Not a Monarch in stats, but can be a very annoying Monster to deal with. It protects your entire board so long as you're willing to pay for its services. The ability to also just reap Monsters from the opponent's GY is quite useful too since there's a bit of recursion in Trinity decks (like this one) and you'll always take a free piece of tribute fodder. Just be mindful of the summon limit... and your remaining LP.</li>  	<li><strong>Glacial Beast Polar Penguin: </strong>This card is a great target for Edea if you need it and if you revive it, can put up a very funny disruption.

Mostly just used for excess Ehther when she's exhausted her usefulness and Erebus if you'd rather not have him in GY. The protection effect is absolutely insane and the on-summon send often makes players panic because there's not very much you can do about it due to no target needing to be declared on activation. Use this to close out games or insulate plays.</li>  	<li><strong>PSY-Framelord Omega: </strong>Shaddoll Falco is a tuner. People usually don't like to attack the Falco because it's bad news bears. Use this to your advantage and convert it into budget Redoer to snowball your advantage and refresh GY effects.</li>  	<li><strong>Crossrose Dragon: </strong>Baobaboon + Any Monster makes it live. You'll just sit on it during the opponent's turn. Fire it as necessary and tag into the appropriate Rose Synchro. Be extremely mindful of Ruddy affecting both GYs as it could butcher your follow-up.</li> </ul>  <hr />  Due to the general complexity that the GY and hand tend to afford you when not even taking into account your Continuous Spells and Traps, the deck is not very beginner friendly. It does lend itself well to immutability, especially when substituting the Shaddoll or Baobaboon portions for other strategies. That said, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:  <em>Floowandereeze &amp; Empen, Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds, Destiny HERO core, Familiar-Possessed/Charmer core, S-Force, Vampire core, Witchcrafter core, Graydle core </em>  Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try!

How about a deck with an insane grindgame or crackback value? If ","Salamangreats are very much a “Jack of all trades, master of none” style of deck. While the deck often plays and handles in the style that a combo deck would, the actual gameplay of Salamangreats often times better resembles that of a control deck. It is a very linear deck that is somewhat lacking in pivot options in favor of having some incredible crackback capabilities and an outstanding grindgame. So while you’re not setting up fields that are packed to the brim with negates, board wipes, or big numbers, you will be able to rebuild your fields and keep playing the game with relative ease, while also impairing your opponent’s moves using the large plethora of handtraps the the deck is capable of running, as well as the two Salamangreat traps, Rage and Roar. Will of the Salamangreat and Balelynx will both give the deck some pretty good resilience, and Jack Jaguar + Sunlight Wolf will allow you to recycle an absolutely massive amount of resources that will help you dominate the grindgame. To top it all off, once you’ve whittled down your opponent enough, you can make Accesscode Talker using Update Jammer extremely easily, which will let you clear up your opponent’s field a bit more and attack twice, in order to deal a staggering total of 10,600 damage, which is more than enough to close games."

Enjoy!,"Ok so, to begin with I mainly got inspired from my favourite yugituber for the whole deck. Thus the deck you will see isn't fully my creation. Anyway I think we all do that but when we do it's better to say it in order to avoid any misunderstandings. Now on to the deck.  Well in youtube you can find many videos that will show you 1 card or 2 card combos with D/D/D. Yes I know that for the deck to make strong enough boards 1 card isn't enough. Recently enough though I came across this particular D/D/D 1 card combo:  Starting hand: Dark Contract with the Gate <ol>  	<li>Activate Gate</li>  	<li>Search D/D Copernicus</li>  	<li>Normal summon Copernicus and with his effect send to the GY one of your D/D Lamias</li>  	<li>Activate Lamia's effect, by sending Gate to your GY she shall special summon herself</li>  	<li>Link Lamia and Copernicus away (Lamia gets banished) for a D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh</li>  	<li>Activate Gilgamesh's effect and set to your pendulum scales D/D Griffon and D/D Savant Thomas</li>  	<li>Pendulum summon Copernicus</li>  	<li>Activate Griffon's pendulum effect, by targeting Copernicus who gains 500 atk and Griffon destroys himself</li>  	<li>Activate Thoma's pendulum effect which lets you add Griffon from your extra deck to your hand</li>  	<li>Activate Griffon's effect and special summon him</li>  	<li>By overlaying Griffon and Copernicus XYZ summon your D/D/D Wave King Caesar</li>  	<li>Link away Caesar and Gilgamesh and summon a second Gilgamesh</li>  	<li>Activate Caesar's effect and add Dark Contract with the Swamp King from your deck to your hand</li>  	<li>Activate Swamp King</li>  	<li>Activate Swamp King's effect and fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis by banishing Gilgamesh and Copernicus from the GY</li>  	<li>By overlaying the Gilgamesh on your field, XYZ summon D/D/D Amnesty King Doom Makina</li>  	<li>Activate Genghis's effect to special summon Griffon from the GY</li>  	<li>Activate Griffon's effect to add D/D/D Headhunt from your deck to your hand</li> </ol> &nbsp;"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  Brave Token, the series takes inspiration from the character archetypes typical of a JRPG—warrior, mage, and the like—with the ""Brave Token"" being a stand-in for the typical silent player character (which somehow explains the player being a token.)  ""Tenyi"" (天てん威い Ten'i) is an archetype introduced in Rising Rampage, made up of Wyrm monsters with various Attributes and centered around Non-Effect Monsters.  &#x1f332;Tips for this deck&#x1f332; :  1. If you have used normal summon you can also use the effect of ""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"" for Special Summon Yang Zing monster from graveyard for activation condition of ""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"".  2. You can use the effect ""Baronne de Fleur"" in Standby Phase on the opponent's turn if you have used the omni negate effect in your turn, you can special summon ""Wandering Gryphon Rider"" from the graveyard, if you still control ""Brave Token"" .  3.

BUT of course the best engine is Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer, but since this is meant to be a budget deck, it's not on the list."

I use <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> because in conjunction with the Tenyi this card has enhanced usefulness in that it can banish any Wyrm I need at the time and add it back to the hand with <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a>. I don't use Swordsoul's Reborn Spell because particularly all the combos that use it I can do them using <a data-name=""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"">Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing</a> instead most of the time, of course the results will be a little different but I also believe it's okay to have a Monster Reborn in that deck to revive main deck cards or Synchro Boss Monsters. <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> have synergy with Tenyi monsters because in the worst case if you open without a move you Special Summon any Tenyi Lv7 and can do together with Veiler the <a data-name=""ChiXiao"">ChiXiao</a>, Along with Ash Blossom the <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> and <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a> in this deck is much better than it looks because besides letting the Tenyi's effects live you can together with Adhara access <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a> which is an excellent card going second. I don't use the generic Synchro 8 Dragite and Omega or simulate because I realize that most of the time I don't choose to access them although in several combos that I'll demonstrate below they are used so it's your choice to decrease the number of Link Monsters Tenyi that I use and put these Synchros in place. I'm not a big fan of the <a data-name=""Chaofeng"">Chaofeng</a> combo because it's nice not to lose to Gamma, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, Veiler and anyone who likes to use <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a> but you end up still losing to <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in Normal Summon and whoever knows the format knows that Impermanence is the Hand Trap more common in any meta deck, even those who have reduced the number of hand traps in the main deck still choose to use Impermanence for its versatility by going first or second.

You'll want to set Domain from the deck off of her effect if you did not open it. Then proceed to just set some more purple cards. </span>  <span>As most of the time you don't really go into any extra deck plays turn 1, duality's restriction isn't that bad. </span>  <span>The deck can make alot of plays during the opponent's turn, like summoning both Fusion boss monsters and if you have Lord of the Heavenly Prision revealed it's even better because you get to set a trap from deck for free. For example Eldlixir, so you also have The Golden Lord next turn.</span>  <span>The fact that you pay almost all of your life points doesn't really matter. As long as you have enough traps in the GY to protect from battle and effect damage, your fine. Also while your below 2000 your Stealthbegia Fusion monster just says ""free solemn strikes and judgements for days!""</span>  <span>One last thing. Always remember your Stealthbegias second effect. I was able to win so many games because noone reads it's second effect. Just being able to Quick effect burn your opponent for like 3000 when they chain Savage or Baronne de Fleur to one of your other effects is so nice.</span>  <span>Also... remember to have fun, your opponents won't ,but atleast your gonna have a blast.</span>  &nbsp;"

Fallen of Albaz(this is a archetype??): fusion summon Dragons and is compatible with most Branded spells/traps. Also now there's a new card called Branded Fusion that fusion summon using monsters from the main deck :)  Frightfur engine: gives you card advantage.  Phantom Knights engine(;---;): is just here because of its traps and to the one combo.  Predaplant: you only want to have Ophrys in hand for the one card combo. Darlingtonia bricks your hand.  PK-Predaplant Combo: Normal summon Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio ~Activate Scorpio effect and special summon Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra from your deck ~Cobra adds Instant fusion from your deck ~Link summon Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss ~Using Cherubini effect send The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots from your to the GY ~Banish Boots from your GY, add Phantom Knights Fog Blade and set it ~Now you can do anything with Despias or Polymerization as long you don't use Cherubini in fusion summons or if you don't have nothing to do jump to the next step ~Activate Instant fusion and special summon El Shaddoll Winda TO ONE OF CHERUBINI LINK MARKERS (remember, this is to protect Winda from being destroyed in the end phase) ~End the turn.  I ain't so dedicated to explain every combo and every card to you guys, so good luck in your test duels and at reading all cards.  !Update: added Albion the Branded Dragon.  !!Update: i added one Edge Imp Chain and took of one Frightfur Patchwork. Now the deck brick less.  Now that i think about it, maybe if I've added the ratios along with the engines description would be easier to understand the combo &#x1f914;...  &nbsp;  GLHF"

You can also play more defensively with the high defense normal monsters, and tribute summon to bring out the higher level main deck monsters. I also added more defense to the deck with mirror force, emergency assistance, and the fairly obvious raigeki.  The extra deck is a little more scrambled, but I did this on purpose. I wanted the extra deck to feel more like a bag of tricks, so the whole extra deck is comprised of generic xyz and links (there's also first of the dragons, I suppose). Also, I thought it would be funny to have the majority of the extra deck monsters be fire or water attribute. That's that on that.  If it wasn't already obvious, yeah this is a casual deck. Unions are pretty funny, so I figured the two elemental bois in a deck focused around them (kinda) would be a fun idea.

You can consistently end on the Mirrorjade Fusion + Sheou with handtraps and traps and plenty of follow up, or play to the strengths of either side of the deck and rely on the other when needed.  <strong>Dragonmaid Package:</strong> Self explanatory.  <strong>Fantasmay:</strong> Material for Sheou and generally good. Can be swapped out.  <strong>Noctovision:</strong> Conflicts with branded fusion but is a good alternative route to spheres when you don't open branded fusion. Also material for Sheou. Can be swapped out.  <strong>Albaz:</strong> Broken with branded fusion. Can also be summoned off of Spheres on the opponents turn as another interruption to superpoly their monster away. You'll often want to discard tidying off of this to revive your dragonmaids.  <strong>Handtraps:</strong> Your choice, but veiler is needed as you need lights as material to branded fusion Divineflame which is the main thing you want to go into for the two card Icejade fusion combo. Also veiler over imperm because imperm conflicts with Fantasmay.  <strong>Branded Fusion:</strong> Absolutely nuts. They key synergy with dragonmaid is that you can send Chamber and Albaz with it to summon Divineflame, which means when you end on the Mirrorjade fusion, you can also revive the Chamber and search to keep fusion or setup backrow.  <strong>Dragon's Mirror:</strong> Meme card that is more clutch than you would think.  &nbsp;  <strong>Core opening combo:</strong>  Hand: Tidying + Branded Fusion + 1 high level dragon  Branded fusion sending Albaz and Chamber for Divineflame - Divineflame effect to discard tidying and shuffle back him and Albaz for Mirrorjade - activate tidying in grave to summon pitched chamber - chamber search changeover - changeover the chamber and high level dragon into Sheou.  What you're left with: <ul>  	<li>Mirrorjade Fusion (non-target banish, search Branded fusion in EP if effect used and you send Stigmatika Dragon, Raigeki in EP if outed to clear your way to kill on the follow up),</li>  	<li>Sheou (omni-negate, plus 2 by summoning Chamber from grave on opponents standby phase for the follow-up, floats into a 3K body with a conditional pop)</li>  	<li>2 Cards in Hand and you haven't conducted your normal summon yet</li> </ul> This type of combo can be achieved with several different combinations of cards, especially with Parlour which can send tidying or changeover from grave and hospitality which lets you extend. If could be stronger if say you drew or already had the changeover, and could search another tidying to set. Even on bad hands, you can probably end with either Sheou or Mirrorjade, and a few traps/handtraps.  &nbsp;"

The Tank class of Duel Monsters, a true weapon hoarder","<span>Let's take a moment to talk about your standard Action-RPG. Most games of this type will have 4-5 basic classes, Mage, Ranger, Summoner, Cleric, and Tank, things of that sort. If this card game were an Action-RPG, this would be the Tank class, no doubt. It hits hard, and doesn't rely on gimmicks or magic to get the job done. Just weapons. Lots and lots of weapons.</span>  <span>This deck is all about brute force, increased by the power of an absurd amount of Equip Spells. It's like when your character picks up a whole backpack of weapons just because he can, even though you only use 1 at a time. This deck uses the entire backpack full of drops all at once.</span>  <span>The overall approach of this deck is equipping monsters with numerous Equip Spells to reach high attack levels that can take down some of the strongest Boss monsters in the game, provided you can survive the negative outcomes of their effects. All of the monsters in the main deck, aside from 2 are Non-effect Monsters, (AKA Normal Monsters), and the Extra Deck monsters are Effect Monsters that protect themselves and your Normal Monsters.</span>  <span>There are 3 basic ways to play this deck, which is partly dependent on your starting hand, and what you draw as the duel goes on. Method A: Equip each Normal Monster with an Equip card and maintain Field advantage. Method B: Give everything to <span>Maha Vailo</span>. Method C: Unleash the power of the Tenyi <span>Link Monsters</span>. With the help of a few special Traps, it is possible to switch playstyles mid-game without putting yourself in a bad spot, allowing you to ruin an opponent's play, or just confuse them.</span>  <span>Before we cover each potential playstyle, lets take a quick look at all the sweet loot drops we've acquired on our quest. These will come in handy with all 3 playstyles.</span>  <span><span><span><em>Axe Of Despair</em></span></span>: Increases a monsters ATK by 1000.</span> <span><em><span>Mage Power</span></em>: Increases a monsters ATK and DEF by 500 for each Spell/Trap you control. It doesn't matter whether or not the card is Set, as long as its in the zone, it counts. With a full backrow of Spell/Traps, a single monster gains 2500 ATK. Throw down a Field Spell for a total of 3000. This deck contains 2 copies of <span>Mage Power</span>, and having both equipped with full power provides 5000 ATK and DEF. Ouch.</span> <span><span><em><span>United We Stand</span></em></span>: The equipped monster gains 800 ATK and DEF for each monster you control. Just like <span>Mage Power</span>, this card gets boosted just for having monsters on your Field. Having all 5 main Zones filled and a Monster occupying the Extra Zone provides a nice attack boost of 4800. This deck contains 2 copies of <span>United We Stand</span>, and having both equipped with full power provides 9600 ATK and DEF. Oh mah lawd!</span> <span><span><em>Metalmorph</em></span>: A Trap Card that provides 300 ATK/DEF. If the equipped monsters attacks, it gains ATK equal to half of the attack target, during damage calculation only.</span>  <span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE A: ""Tank Class Raid Party""</span></strong></span> <span>This playstyle revolves around equipping each of your Normal Monsters with at least 1 Equip Spell. As mentioned earlier, the more cards present on your side of the field, the higher the number climbs. Each of your monsters are going to be exactly the same, aside from Type and Attribute, which doesn't matter within this setup. They all are <span>Level 4</span>, and have 2000 ATK and 0 DEF. At the time of writing, there are currently 10 Normal Monsters that share these 3 traits: <span>Alexandrite Dragon, Gene-Warped Warwolf, Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder, Zombino, Mystery Shell Dragon, Gunkan Suship Shari, Leotron, Phantom Gryphon, Megalosmasher X</span>, and <span>Mekk-Knight Avram</span>. You will need 15 of these monsters in the deck; which ones and the amount doesn't matter, except for <span>Mystery Shell Dragon</span>. You absolutely need 3 of this guy, and I'll explain why in Playstyle C. This deck's only <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> and 2 of the 5 <span>Link Monsters</span> are best utilized in this playstyle as well. <strong>Photon Papilloperative</strong> is a <span>Rank 4</span> <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> with 2100 ATK that requires 2 materials to Summon. This monster changes an opponents Defense Position Monster to Attack Position and lowers it's ATK by 600. <span>Defender Of The Labyrinth</span> is a <span>Link Monster</span> who requires 2 Normal Monsters to Summon. He boosts the ATK of all Normal Monsters you control by 500, and lowers the ATK of your opponent's Effect Monsters by 500. If he is slain, you can Special Summon 1 Normal Monster from your Graveyard. Be absolutely sure to give this guy an Equip Spell, as his base ATK is only 1400, which makes him an easy target. You can use <span>Defender Of The Labyrinth's</span> <span>Link Rating</span> <span>of 2 </span>and 1 additional Monster to <span>Link Summon Berserker Of The Tenyi</span>, a Non-Effect Monster rocking a solid 3000 ATK.</span>  <span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE B: ""Lord Broham's Legacy""</span></strong></span> <span><span>Maha Vailo</span> and his retrained counterpart <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heavens</span> are downright broken in a setup like this. <span>Maha Vailo</span> is a <span>Level 4</span> Spellcaster sporting 1550 ATK, which might not seem like much, but what makes this guy so special is his amazing effect. He gains an additional 500 ATK for each Equip Spell Card equipped to him. <span>Axe Of Despair</span> alone jumps his ATK up to 3050, enough to just barely overpower <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span>. If you have 6 monsters on your side of the field, and have <span>Maha Vailo</span> equipped with 2 <span>Mage Powers</span>, 2 <span>United We Stand</span>, and an <span>Axe Of Despair</span>, his ATK becomes 19,650. Obviously, his maximum ATK is a bit unessessary, but the point is, its not hard to boost this guy's strength to ridiculous heights. <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heavens</span> more or less works in the same way, but gains additional effects based on the amount of Equip Spells he's holding. What's more, he gains an additional 1000 ATK for each Equip Spell equipped to him. Having 2 or 4 Equip Spells prevents your opponent from activating Monster Effects or Card Effects respectively during the Battle Phase, and having 3 lets you negate an Effect that targets him by sending one of your Equip Spells from anywhere on your side of the field to the Graveyard. Lastly, having 5 doubles Battle Damage this monster inflicts. During the unlikely scenario described earlier, this monsters maximum ATK using this deck's setup is 22,150. In most situations, regular <span>Maha Vailo</span> is much easier to work with, as his retrained version requires 2 Tributes to Summon, also if your Equip Spells are already on the field, without using <span>Collected Power</span>, he won't have much to work with. Once he's fully geared up though, he's damn near impossible to stop. Just 1 warning: BEWARE OF <span>MAGIC CYLINDER</span>!</span>  <span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE C: ""Tenyi No Like Effect""</span></strong></span> <span>The remaining 2 <span>Link Monsters</span> in the Extra Deck can honestly put pressure on your opponent by themselves, but having at least 1 of your Normal Monsters present helps even more. Before we reveal the powers of the Tenyi, let's learn how to summon them first. <span>Draco Masters Of The Tenyi</span> has a <span>Link Rating of 3</span> and requires a <span>Link Monster</span> as well, while <span>Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara's</span> <span>Link Rating is 4</span> and also requires 2+ Wyrm Monsters. Obviously, you'll need <span>Draco</span> summoned first before you can get <span>Sahasrara</span>. There are a few ways to do this. Firstly, while you already have a monster on your field, you can Normal Summon a Normal Monster, use it to <span>Link Summon Link Spider</span>, then use it's effect to Special Summon another Normal Monster from your hand, and there you go. 3 Monsters. <span>Draco Masters Of The Tenyi</span> can now be summoned. <span>Double Summon</span> can be used if you intend to get him out in one turn and your Monsters Zones are currently Vacant. The other way to get <span>Draco</span> out is to pop <span>Scapegoat</span>, and use one of the tokens to get <span>Link Spider</span>. A reminder that <span>Scapegoat</span> Tokens are treated as Normal Monsters. <span>Link Spider's</span> only real purpose is to be <span>Link</span> fodder for <span>Draco</span>, it's weak ATK power of 1000 renders it useless otherwise. <span>Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara's</span> summon requirement is 2+ Wyrm monsters. Even though <span>Draco</span> is a Wyrm type, he alone only contributes a <span>Link Rating of 3</span>. This is why we have 3 <span>Mystery Shell Dragons</span>. It is Wyrm type. Using <span>Draco</span> and a <span>Mystery Shell Dragon</span> is all you need to summon <span>Sahasrara</span>. Now, what exactly do they do? Make life difficult for your opponent, that's what. <span>Draco</span> has 2600 ATK and can only be destroyed by battle by a Normal Monster. Give him an Equip Spell and chances are your opponent won't be able to do that. Also, it's effect allows you to destroy your opponents Effect Monsters equal to the number of Normal Monsters you have on the field or in the Graveyard, as long as you do not control another Effect Monster other than <span>Draco</span>. <span>Sahasrara</span> on the other hand, has 3000 ATK, and prevents all of your effect monsters from being targeted by attacks or card effects so long as you control at least 1 Normal Monster. A boosted one will do just fine. At this point you can taunt your opponent if you know that they don't have a <span>Raigeki</span> or <span>Dark Hole</span>. <span>Sahasrara</span> can also target 1 of your opponent's Effect Monsters and generate a Token with ATK power equal to the chosen target, which provides you with the Normal Monster needed to maintain his awesome protection effect.</span>  <span>At last, lets cover the remaining cards among the deck, which can be used effectively in each playstyle. First of all is <span>Double Summon</span>, which is just used to establish Field advantage, summon <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heaverns</span> a bit easier, or quickly perform a <span>Link Summon</span>. <span>Scapegoat</span> is to be used for emergency defense, or a speedy <span>Link Summon</span>. It can also be used for a very fast boost to <span>United We Stand</span>. <span>Armory Call</span> can be used to gather an Equip Spell in a pinch, while <span>Collected Power</span> transfers all Equip Spells on the field to a single target. This is the easiest way to give everything to <span>Maha Vailo</span>, and it even takes your opponents Equip Spells as well. Just be sure not to use this while you have <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> active. <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> is an Equip Spell that you equip to one of your opponents monsters. While equipped, it renders them unable to attack, and at the end of the 2nd turn after its activation, the equipped monster is destroyed, and <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> is returned to your hand. Lastly, you have 3 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> used to destroy set Spells/Traps, and 2 <span>Mirror Forces</span> to be an ass towards your opponent.</span>  <span>This deck exists purely as an entertainment tool, and is not to be taken seriously. It's not what I would consider ""Top-tier"" and if you don't get it properly setup quickly, it can be tough to recover from your opponent's Field dominance. It is immensely satisfying when you do get it to work though, and was mainly created because I love <span>Maha Vailo</span> so much, and was just curious as to how well I could get him to work. If you're like me, and just want to have fun, give this deck a try. Despite the lengthy review, its very simple to use, it's relatively cheap, and cards like <span>Mage Power</span> and <span>United We Stand</span> are interchangeable and work well in almost any deck. As always, feel free to share any idea/strategies you may have, and I'll look into them. Who knows, maybe together, we can make this a Top-tier deck after all...</span>"

Grind out your opponent while you maintain car","“Ancient Earth Machine” harnesses the full might of the Military Industrial Complex to turbo out monstrous mechas like Dingirsu, Rail Cannon Liebe, Divine Arsenal Zeus, Machina Ruinforce, and best of all - Ancient Gear Chaos Giant!  Functioning as a grindy aggro-beatdown deck, Ancient Earth Machine’s gameplan is to wear down your opponent’s resources while you maintain card advantage – <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/nxAD2vk"">preparing an ideal gamestate where you can certainly OTK</a>. Ancient Earth Machine is designed as a “turn 3 deck.” Creating an ideal board turn 1, defending/interrupting opponent turn 2, then OTKing turn 3.  Going first, this deck seeks to blow up your opponent’s entire board with <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a>’s field-wipe and create an nigh-unbreakable wall with an unaffected 4000 DEF Rail Cannon Super Dora. Hand advantage and resources are maintained with Urgent Schedule, Revolving Switchyard and by resolving Ancient Gear Box/Super Express Bullet Train multiple times.  On the play, his deck can easily generate enough lethal firepower to obliterate your opponent’s life points several times over by summoning several machine boss monsters on the field often playing through handtraps/interruption due to it's sheer resource advantage. Nothing much can withstand the assault of the likes of Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, Machina Ruinforce, and Rail Cannon Liebe! If your opponent manages to survive, Dingirsu or Liebe can make a 4 material Zeus, enough for two fieldwipes!  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span></p> <strong> </strong>  I describe this deck as a “Military Industrial Complex” because its 4 archetypes are designed for maximum firepower and peak productivity. Also, this deck is fairly complex to pilot!  <strong>The Military</strong>  Ancient Gear forms the main offensive force of this army, with all it’s units eventually coalescing into the general, Chaos Giant, obliterating everything in it’s path. It is very compact compared to other standard Ancient Gear decks, but it consistently accomplishes it’s job of turboing out Ancient Gear Chaos Giant. <em>It is composed of 1 Wyvern, 2 Frame, 2 Box, 1 Fusion, and 1 GearTown. In the Extra Deck there are 2 Ballista, 1 Ultimate Golem, 1 Megaton Golem and 1 Chaos Giant.</em>  Machina are the legions of soldiers that compose this army, eroding the enemy in defensive attrition-based warfare. Enabling battle operations with Redeployment, Gearframe, and Unclaspare – Citadel and Fortress thin out enemy forces before finishing them off with Ruinforce<em>. It is composed of 1 Ruinforce, 1 Citadel, 1 Fortress, 2 Unclaspare, 3 Gearframe, 3 Redeployment, and 3 Overdrive. </em>  <strong>The Industry</strong>  Trains supply the war machine with ammunitions and resources from behind the lines through it’s extensive network via Revolving Switchyard. Super Express Bullet Train’s salvage operations recycle dead metal into brand new war machines while Urgent Schedule rushes units to the frontline. Superdreadnought-class Rail Cannons “Liebe” and “Dora” provide cover through their fearsome artillery barrage. <em>It is composed of 2 Super Express Bullet Train, 1 Infinitrack Tunneller, 3 Revolving Switchyard, 1 Terraforming, and 3 Urgent Schedule. In the Extra deck there is Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora and Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe.</em>  <strong>The Complex</strong>  Sky Striker is a special ops unit piloted by a single girl. She supports the army by extending supply lines and through pinpoint threat removal. Engage! add Hornet Drones, which can lead to Zeke (targeted banish of monster), Knightmare Phoenix (backrow destruction) and Kaina (Earth Machine Extender). <em>It is composed of 1 Engage! and Hornet Drones. In the Extra Deck there is Sky Striker Ace - Kagari, Sky Striker Ace - Kaina, Sky Striker Ace - Zeke, and Knightmare Phoenix.</em>  AA-Zeus is the most skilled pilot in the army, piloting one of the most potent mechas ever created. Capable of decimating entire regions, vast armies have been annihilated by Zeus’ overwhelming firepower and speed. AA-Zeus can be deployed by any XYZ, but it prefers to be summoned by it’s predecessors Liebe and Dingirsu so it has the maximum amount of XYZ materials (usually 4) to repeatedly wipe the field clean. In the maindeck it<em> is composed of 1 Infinitrack Anchor Drill. In the Extra Deck it is composed of 1 Dingirsu the Orcust of the Evening Star, 1 Number 84: Pain Gainer, and 1 Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder.</em> <p><em> </em></p> <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p> <strong> </strong>  Ancient Earth Machine’s combos are non-linear and are largely hand-dependent. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/763HxLb"">The quality of your hand determines the resilience and power of your first turn board.</a> Turn 1 boards greatly vary as a result, but ideally the field has a Rail Cannon Super Dora, any other machine monster, a set Machina Overdrive and Machina Citadel in the GY.  <strong> <u>Going first (Turn 1),</u></strong> this deck seeks to gather as much resources as possible while setting up the GY and field. Ideally, a fieldwipe with Machina Citadel is also set-up via sending the monster to the GY and/or setting Machina Overdrive.  This is this deck’s main combo if Machina Gearframe, Revolving Switchyard and any extender are in your first turn hand: <ol>  	<li>Activate Revolving Switchyard.</li>  	<li>Normal summon Machina Gearframe. Gearframe searches Machina Unclaspare.</li>  	<li>Machina Unclaspare summons itself, and it sends from deck to GY Machina Citadel.</li>  	<li>XYZ summon Gear Gigant X. Detach from Gear Gigant X to search for Ancient Gear Box. Ancient Gear box searches Anchor Drill/Ancient Gear Frame.</li>  	<li>Summon extender from hand. (Machina Fortress/Sky Striker Ace – Kaina and Super Express Bullet Train.)</li>  	<li><u>If Machina Fortress/Sky Striker Ace - Kaina was summoned:</u> Link away both Gear Gigant X/Extender for Double Headed Anger Knuckle. Use Double Anger Knuckle to summon Machina Citadel from GY. The level 10 Earth Machine summoned will trigger Revolving Switchyard’s effect, which will get you Rail Cannon Super Dora.</li>  	<li><u>If Super Express Bullet Train was summoned:</u> The level 10 Earth Machine summoned will trigger Revolving Switchyard’s effect, which will get you Rail Cannon Super Dora. Detach Super Express Bullet Train from Dora to get it’s end turn effect to recover a machine from your GY.</li>  	<li>Set your other cards like Urgent Schedule, Machina Overdrive, and Impermanence.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong><u>With this first turn board (Turn 2),</u></strong> you have an near-invincible monster (Super Dora), a potential fieldwipe with Machina Citadel and 2-3 extra cards in hand from resolving Ancient Gear Box and Super Express Bullet Train.  <u> If you control a set Machina Overdrive</u>, you can use it to summon Citadel from your GY or deck so you don’t have to wait for your opponent to trigger its summon for you. From there, fieldwipe your opponent with Citadel at the most optimal timing when it hurts them the most. Summoning Citadel also triggers Revolving Switchyard's summon from deck effect. Machina Overdrive can also get you an additional +1 draw later.  <u>If you control a set Urgent Schedule</u> and a Revolving Switchyard, you can flood the field with three monster cards that all float and net you additional resources.  Try to summon and send Super Express Bullet Train (It is an ideal target to destroy with Citadel) to the GY again this turn. It can retrigger the effects of Ancient Gear Box during the endphase, granting you more resources from deck!  &nbsp;  The following turn, <strong>(Turn 3), </strong>assuming your GY was set up last turn and you gathered enough resources by resolving Revolving Switchyard, Ancient Gear Box, Super Express Bullet Train and Machina Overdrive as much as possible,<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/nxAD2vk""> you should have enough resources to break your opponent’s board and OTK.</a> Overlay Liebe on Super Dora, summon Machina Ruinforce from GY, fusion summon Ancient Gear Chaos Giant and more!  &nbsp;  The threats on your opponent’s board will determine your next course of action.  &nbsp;  <u>If you want to wipe the field with Zeus</u>, Zeus can be made with Super Dora -&gt; Liebe. Also, if you have Infinitrack Anchor Drill + another earth machine you can make a 4 material Zeus. Use Anchor Drill’s effect + another level 4 to make Dingirsu. Attack with Dingirsu, overlay it with Number 84: Pain Gainer -&gt; 4 material Zeus which can wipe the field twice. If you can’t go for the OTK yet, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/RjbjNX0"">Zeus is a great way to equalize the board so you can go for the kill next turn.</a>  &nbsp;  <u></u><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/XRlQtpT""><u>If you want to wipe the field of your opponent’s monsters with Machina Citadel,</u></a> it can easily be summoned by destroying your earth machine monster (usually by crashing it into a stronger monster during battle phase). While it can destroy every monster under 3000 if it destroys itself with its effect, it can destroy Machina Ruinforce to destroy everything under 4600!  <u>If you want to grind out your opponent's resources on board</u>, try to get Machina Citadel and Machina Fortress in rotation (In the GY and field). These two machines form a very strong tag team. If one gets destroyed, they summon each other, while wearing picking apart or blowing up your opponent's board.  <u>If you are certain you can go for the kill,</u> it can be easily done by summoning Ancient Gear Ballista. It’s main goal is to gather the resources needed to summon Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, and to bring your opponent’s monster’s ATK/DEF to 0. Ballista destroys Geartown with it’s effect and Geartown summons from deck Ancient Gear Wyvern so it can search Ancient Gear Fusion. Given the right conditions, Chaos Giant alone is usually enough to OTK your opponent.  &nbsp;  <u>If you know the opponent is going to disrupt your plays,</u> keep Super Dora on the field to provide extra protection. It will make sure any monster is unaffected by card effect if anything tries to negate/banish/destroy/etc. ensuring your plays get through! Liebe can be overlayed on Dora anytime to offer extra firepower afterward and a potential 2 material Zeus.  &nbsp;  <u>If you know your opponent is going to destroy your card(s),</u> make Dingirsu before going for your main play because it can protect any card from destruction with it’s effect. Use Anchor Drill’s effect + another level 4 to make Dingirsu. This card has an added bonus of sending a worrying card from your opponent’s field like backrow threats or a problematic monster.  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p> <strong> </strong> <ul>  	<li>If you want to cut cards from this deck, you can do away with most of the Ancient Gear package (2 Frame, 1 Wyvern, 1 GearTown, 1 Fusion and all 3 fusions in the Extra Deck). Ancient Gear Chaos Giant is my personal ace card, and I placed it in this deck largely from my own bias. They can be replaced with staples, handtraps, or trap cards to make it similar to Pak’s LCS topping Machina list.</li>  	<li>The key to this deck is patience and timing. If you feel you can’t OTK your opponent, try to conserve your resources (keep your cards in hand and don’t banish from GY yet) until you’re sure you can deliver the finishing blow. While this deck has decent recovery options (Gear Box, Express Bullet Train, Revolving Switchyard), maintaining superior card advantage and depleting your opponent’s board with constant field wipes (Zeus/Citadel) is where it’s strength truly shines. When your opponent is weak and helpless, that’s when you summon your machine army en-masse!</li>  	<li>This deck discards a lot through it’s use of Revolving Switchyard, Machina Redeployment, Ancient Gear Frame and Double Handed Anger Knuckle. The best cards to discard are Machinas (Ruinforce, Citadel, Fortress, Overdrive, etc.), since they have so much utility in the GY. Discarding Super Express Bullet Train is very good, since it fulfills it’s recovery effect during the endphase if sent to the GY. Discarding spent Sky Striker cards are useful as well, since they usually are used once a duel. Discarding Infinitrack Anchor Drill is great as well, since its recycling effect in the GY is usually live with how much this deck goes through it's Earth Machines.</li>  	<li>Ancient Earth Machine sometimes dies to a well-timed handtrap/disruption. Common handtraps like Droll, Nibiru and Dimension Shifter can stop you cold mid-combo. An Ash Blossom or Impermanence on your starter can end your turn if you didn’t open an extender. Called by the Grave and DD Crow (normally reserved for Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer). banish your set-up GY monsters (Citadel and Ruinforce). This deck is only a rogue contender but can steal wins away from real meta threats.</li>  	<li>This deck has a hard time vs. backrow, especially floodgates like TCBOO and Zombie World. Side in backrow hate in matchups where these are common!</li>  	<li>Floodgate traps like Rivalry of Warlords, Skill Drain and Imperial Order work pretty well with this deck when used properly. Consider using them to choke out your opponent while you play unhindered.</li>  	<li>Since this deck is highly dependent on resolving your starter, always try to lead with cards that bait out handtraps like Engage! or Revolving Switchyard. Once you lured out their ash, you can go for combo as normal.</li>  	<li>If the game goes the distance and many of your starters, combo pieces and key cards are in the GY and Banished Pile, Infinitrack Tunneller (Searchable via Ancient Gear Box) and Machina Overdrive (Searchable via Machina Redeployment) can recycle your spent machine cards. Remember if you can't OTK your opponent, out resource them with your superior grindgame!</li> </ul> &nbsp; <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p> &nbsp;  Inspired by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Kyle Galliw’s Machina</a> list and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/earth-machine-dozer-control-budget-original-by-aerosol_tcg/"">Aerosol_TCG’s Earth Machine</a> deck, I sought to create the perfect framework to turbo out my beloved ace monster, Chaos Giant and to make Ancient Gears as competitive as possible. This resulted in the creation of this monstrous machine mishmash (I think I’ve largely succeded)! This deck still dies to handtraps, has a difficult time dealing with established meta boards, and keels over to strong floodgates, but is it ever potent!  My favourite Yugioh cards as a child were machines like Machine King, Mechanical Chaser and Roulette Barrel. When I returned to Yugioh back at 2017 I purchased a copy of the “Machine Reactor” structure deck, and ever since then I’ve always been an Ancient Gear/machine-focused duelist at heart. Ancient Earth Machine combines all my favourite machines into one seamless synergetic deck with my ideal playstyle of Aggro/Beatdown. Best of all, it turbo’s out my ace monster, Chaos Ancient Gear Giant!  Harness the full power of the Military Industrial Complex and obliterate your opponent with your Ancient Earth Machine army! I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online or IRL. GLHF Duelists!  &nbsp; <p><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/KNYu2bu""><span><em><strong>POV: You are about to be OTK'd!</strong></em></span></a></p> &nbsp;"

Kitt and Branded Fusion are the MVP of the deck and a must of 3x.  Albion helps you out of brick hands but i believe in a 3x it's tuo heavy.  Gold Sarc is good because you can banish Mercourier, which will add Kitt, who Will add Branded fusion.  I was thinking about siding the 2 D. Barrier for one Fusion Gate and a fusion substitute to help in case of a albaz + brick in hand.  I'd like to hear your opinion on this one in a comment and feed back are always welcomed."

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Despia"" (デスピア Desupia) is an archetype of DARK Fairy and LIGHT Fiend monsters introduced in Dawn of Majesty. ""Despia""/""Despian"" is a combination of the words ""despair"", ""death"", and ""thespian"". The names of ""Despia"" cards stems from theatrical elements and drama. The theatrical theme of the ""Despia"" archetype is fitting, as these monsters kept up the facade of a holy Church for a long time, as if they were playing a theatrical fiction, before revealing their true colors.  Albaz Dragon is a series of Level 8 DARK or LIGHT Fusion Monsters that specifically list ""Fallen of Albaz"" as a Fusion Material. They share a similar naming scheme, and the majority of them have 2500 ATK and 2000 DEF. Despite their names and appearances, not all members are Dragon-Type. The series is indirectly supported by the ""Branded"" archetype.  Link to use this deck :  https://youtube.com/watch?v=toEb9z-Vm-I"

Many lists were either running a large HERO package complete with Stratos, Malicious, and D-Draw or a heavier zombie package that made use of Pyramid Turtle and Mystic Tomato as extra floaters. This list includes the remnants of Tele-DAD combined with all the zombie goodness. In my opinion, D-Draw is just to gimmicky to run even with Stratos. Nearly every monster in this deck is a dark, so Allure of Darkness is great for draw power. Double Foolish Burial (can you believe this card was ever not limited) lets us dump anything to the graveyard, but Mezuki is usually the choice since it can not be sent off of Arma Knight or Dark Grepher. Speaking of Arma Knight and Dark Grepher, they let us get Malicious out of the deck early to prevent a dead draw later. Reinforcement of the Army is included for obvious reasons. Some dark good stuff rounds out the monsters. Notably, I am not including Pyramid Turtle or Mystic Tomato. My reason for doing so is that there are so many ways in the format to get rid of face down monsters without destroying them by battle. 2009-2010 is the absolute heyday for zombie decks, so grab a friend to play retro formats and enjoy the list!"

Normal summoning and banishing are the bread and butter of this deck, so use it well. All the low levels birds are banished when they leave the field and return to your hand on a successful summon of another Winged-Beast monster.  &nbsp;  Ideal opening hand here is Nadir + Robina. Activate Nadir, send your choice of ED monster (varies on need) and add Ecclesia. Normal summon Robina, search and summon Eaglen. Search Empen off of Eaglen and normal summon. Add Map or Unknown Winds (if you opened map) and normal summon Ecclesia off of Empen. Search Punishment, set and pass. Map gives you a summon of their normal summon, giving you the chance to summon birds and turbo out whatever monster you need. Notable monsters here are Raiza to remove your opponents board and Apex Avian for a free negate."

So instead add Melffys and drown in resources!  Main strategy here is to use the bears for what they should be used for: handtraps and synchro summoning. High level bears + a Melffy is a free Baronne (aka Synchro Dragoon) on board. If you're in a pinch, Rescue Cat can turbo out the materials you need to summon Halqifibrax and synchro on your opponents turn. Obedience can get you a Joyous Melffy on board for disruption plays in case you draw bad. Anything is better than nothing, which is what the bears alone leave you with. Ideally you open Radiation and just go nuts on summoning bears to keep adding cards to your hands.  Also the level 10 Swordsoul Synchro works amazingly well with the deck. With Big Dipper on the board, you can banish bears from the graveyard to summon from hand. This means you can use the big bears for their hand trap functions, and banishing to summon them lets you banish from your opponents field and graveyard with your Swordsoul!"

Use this if you really like summoning a lot of HERO monsters and fast!,"The entire purpose of this deck is to swarm the field with as many HERO cards as you can. With this deck you should constantly work to take down your opponent in a move or two. If you wait much longer it can get a little bit dicey with the lack of negates, I put in this deck. The Mirror Force I have in the deck is incredibly flexible as well. I'm just old fashioned and like the classic Mirror Force card but those two card slots are very easily replaced with whatever you want in the deck. As far as the monsters go, I'm still not entirely sold on Destiny HERO Dogma but he's a nice option to combo with Destiny HERO Dystopia when using Fusion Destiny. You could also easily go with less Destiny HERO Drawhand's as well. I just like the extra cards and typically your opponent shouldn't be around long enough for them getting extra cards to matter too much.  As far as general strategy with this deck I recommend rushing out Masked HERO Dark Law when you go first and a second fusion HERO. If you go second go immediately for the OTK. Bring out Malicious Bane who can clear out all faceup monsters on your opponent's side of the field with less attack them him. Then bring out Elemental HERO Sunrise to boost all your monsters ATK and get you a free Miracle Fusion from your deck. Then you can use that Miracle Fusion to bring out one of your other Elemental HERO fusion monsters.  You can also go into the OP strategy with the Vision HERO's. All you need is Vision HERO Faris in your hand and any other monster. You can tribute the other monster from your hand to Special Summon Vision HERO Faris. With his effect you bring Vision HERO Increase to your spell/trap card zone from your deck. Then activate the effect of Vision HERO Increase to tribute a faceup monster (Likely and usually Vision HERO Faris) to special summon Vision HERO Vyon. Then use Elemental HERO Vyon's effect to send a HERO monster to the graveyard. (I prefer to use this effect on an Elemental HERO Shadow Mist unless I gave him up from my hand to summon Vison HERO Faris in the first place. If that's the case Destiny HERO Drawhand, Vision HERO Increase or Destiny HERO Dynatag work good as well.) Once Elemental HERO Shadow Mist is sent to the graveyard you can use his effect to add any HERO monster you want to your hand. I use this effect to add Evil HERO Adusted Gold. Then from the field I use Vision HERO Vyon's other effect to remove from play a HERO monster from my graveyard to add a Polymerization to my hand. I usually will remove from play Elemental HERO Shadow Mist. Next, I activate the effect of Evil HERO Adusted Gold to add Dark Calling to my hand from the deck. You can then use Dark Calling to fuse Vision HERO Faris with Evil HERO Adusted Gold to summon Evil Hero Malicious Bane. From there you can use the polymerization to summon another fusion monster or use some of the other cards from your hand to support some other fusion summons and you are typically in a pretty good spot to get a first turn OTK.  In a pinch you can also always use the classic board wipe combo by Fusion summing Elemental HERO Absolute Zero and using Mask Change on him to summon Masked HERO Acid. Together they wipe your opponent's entire field.  There are many other combo's that can be done with this deck as well but aren't as consistent. Fusion Destiny to bring out Destiny HERO Dystopia is always a nice play. You can also mess around a bit with the XTRA HERO's I added in this deck if link summoning is your thing. If you're not a big fan of link summoning, you could always replace them with some more Masked HERO or Omni HERO options. Also, Super Polymerization can be a nice way to remove an opponent's boss monster from the field granted only if they are Light, Dark or Water. This is where adding more of the Omni Hero's can be pretty beneficial.  Moreso than anything, just have fun using this deck to summon tons of cool HERO cards.!"

Best of luck on your next duel!"

Use <strong>Earth Slicer</strong> to angry your opponent.  use the <strong>Galaxy Destroyer</strong> to destroy opponent spell &amp; trap cards.  Use the <strong>Sky Palace</strong> to destroy.  use <strong>Goliath</strong> to revive the Infinitrack XYZ.  Use <strong>Anger Knuckle</strong> if you want to summon lvl 10 monsters.  do not use <strong>Megaclops... it's there only for decoration.</strong>  &nbsp;  Useful Monsters:  <strong>Metalcruncher</strong> can be used to search any machine monster, so start w that one.  <strong>Express Knight</strong> can be normal without tributing.  <strong>Derricane &amp; express</strong> can be special easily.  <strong>Crab Cane</strong> can bring up the rank up.  <strong>Brutal Dozer</strong> can special summon a infinitrack monster.  <strong>tunneller</strong> works like a pot of avarice for machines.  <strong>anchor drill</strong> can special summon from the hand (and bring a rank 9 if you use it smartly).  <strong>railroad stampede</strong> special summons from the graveyard.  <strong>harvester</strong> can search an infinitrack monster (and do the same that drill does).  useful spells:  special schedule can be used to bring back an XYZ monster from the grave.  urgent schedule (everyone knows what this thing does).  Heavy Forward can search an infinitrack monster (good to avoid bricks) and be used as material.  Outrigger Extension.

This deck consists of specially summoning Shadow Mist to add a Mask Change and/or summoning Woodsman and adding a Polymerization and summoning some HERO from the extra deck.  Hero's Bond is a great way to summon Shadow Mist to have a Mask Change, Hero Signal is a great way to summon a Stratos, Shadow Mist or Woodsman to activate the effect that suits you best, without many support cards of the HERO archetype, this one deck doesn't have much offensive or even defensive power, but I think it's even pretty strong for a protagonist deck"

What you're looking at here is an Albaz Dinosaurs deck, including one of the best Fusion spells in the game, Branded Fusion! Branded Fusion allows you to Fusion Summon a monster using monsters from your hand, field, and even Deck, as long as one of the Fusion Materials for that Fusion Monster is ""Fallen of Albaz"".  As for this deck's name, ""Indominus the Untamable Dragon"" is a reference to one of the dinosaurs from Jurassic World, <em>Indominus Rex</em>, whose name is Latin for ""<em>Untamable King</em>."" It also keeps in theme with the Albaz fusions' names.  For this deck, your strategy is to summon UCT and other monsters. You can use Branded Fusion to summon Rubellion the Divineflame Dragon, and send Overtex Qoatlus and Albaz as fusion material. Then you can use Qoatlus's effect to search Double Evolution Pill, and then activate it to summon UCT.  If you're going first, your goal is to either sit on Dolkka and UCT, or use the combo I mentioned above <em><strong>and</strong></em> Rubellion's effect to sit on UCT and Predaplant Dragostepelia. But if going second, your goal is to summon as many beaters as you can and hunt your opponent's Life Points into extinction.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Two increase, tried playing 1 but i bricked on it too much, It is worth having the second one in ur deck so you have the faris line always avaliable since you can pitch increase in hand anyway.  Two stratos and one e call. Two stratos is more than enough , you can get away with playing one with pot of prosperity but without prosperities its better to play two stratos and an e call to keep the consistency up.  Not playing solid soilder bc of imperms/veiler being in the format , it just isn't worth getting its effect being negated.  Playing alot of d heros in the main because without prosperity its better to play more. With vyon being the best normal in the deck drawing vyon and another d hero can get you to Phoenix enforcer in under 5 summons. IE Normal Vyon , sent shadow mist , search mali, banish mist get poly, use d hero in hand and mali in hand to get the phoenix enforcer.  DRAW HAND IS BROKEN - draw hand is insane you can use it to force dark law rip and with droll you can lock them out of their main deck, also when playing under nib, u can revive draw hand in their stanby and with mask change make dark law on their turn.  NO MIRACLE FUSION . Evil heros are so much better than playing the miracle fusion/sunriser it takes up two main deck spots vs 1 but you clear up so much more of the extra deck for yourself. Also under There can only be one you can get the bane out bc its a fiend and try to set urself up with a fusion warrior monster.  EXTRA DECK : masked heros are pretty standard. We play anki bc he can kill pretty easily since we play chalice, you can do the duel links damage step chalice play to attack people for alot of damage. Also i do not play ab zero but i still play the masked hero to just clear out back row against backrow decks.  SIDE DECK  IMPORTANT!!For games two/three you should side out the e call so if you dont get drolled on the e call!!  SIDING MAINLY THINK ABOUT DROLL AND NIB , they hurt the deck the most. practice playing against them when you test the deck.  Siding going first you side in all 6 traps. remember you cannot use appointer if you have no cards in hand, also use appointer in DP or SP to rip out board breaking cards or important combo pieces.  siding in droll is good for using draw hand and dark law to keep them out of their main deck."

My take on Unchained. I have been playing the archetype for a while now (about a year). Hope you enjoy, and please let me know if you have suggestions for improvements! <strong>--- introduction ---</strong>  <strong>--- ratios main ---</strong> The following ratios are so standard in any build/variation of unchained, that I am not going to spend any time explaining them. 3x rakea 3x aruha 3x sarama 2x unchained soul 1x unchained soul of disaster 3x abominations prison 3x extravagance 2/3x abominable chamber of the unchained 3x escape of the unchained  3x unchained soul of rage 3x unchained soul of anguish 2x knightmare unicorn 1/2x accesscode  As for the other ratios, I will place a couple of comments for those who are interested. 2x ash blossom - Optional. Goes well with extravagance, trying to establish card advantage. 2x ghost belle - Optional. I like ghost belle a lot because (1) I think it is a great card overal (2) there is niche synergy with the weaknesses of the deck. For example, ice dragons prison can hurt the deck a lot, but so can cards that banish/steal your resources from the graveyard like called by grave, naelshaddoll, shark cannon and others. 1x called by grave - Goes well with extravagance, trying to establish clear card advantage. 2x abominable chamber of the unchained - Controversial maybe. But the games where I open say 2x unchained traps without any of the monsters I straight out lose. This is to minimize such bricky hands. I have been digging this ratio really well when testing, especially in combination with trap trick, which I will talk about later. 3x imperm - Personal preference. I feel this card is important to discuss because It directly conflicts with the gamma package/fantastical dragon phantazmay, which became popular for unchained quite recently. I think the card is so generic that it is worth it. OK going 1st. VERY good going 2nd (dealing with floodgates + backrow negates). 2x ice dragons prison - Amazing card. Leave out the non targeting banish 2 and I still think its a great card, just to put the strength of the card in perspective. Also, it outs dragoon which is this decks cryptonite. 3x torrential tribute - Konami might as well have named the card unchained torrential tribute. I would have played this card at 6 if I could. Let me just mention 1 of the 100 nice deck interations. If you have rage on the board + TT, then you can link into anguish, blow the board up afterwards (or later during the turn), and take sarama to hand for a strong follow up. 2x trap trick - (2nd) Best card in the deck. My favourite play is to activate the card in end phase to set escape of the unchained to then pop backrow your opponent just set, with a potential follow up of summoning abominable for another pop, once again, still in end phase. 1x skill drain - BEST card in deck, hands down. (1) You have three 3k ATK targets you can summon from deck. (2) All your monsters trigger in GY anyway, so worst case scenario you can crash your monsters, something you will doing anyway if you play the deck for more than a day. 1x imperial order  1x unchained abomination - We all know you will almost never make this. 95% of the time accesscode is better, the other 5 percent is probably your eldlich matchup. 1x topologic bomber dragon - Interesting link target against any link based deck (salamangreat, @ignister, cyberse, etc). 2x divine arsenal aa-zeus - I'll leave you to reading the 4 xyz monsters. One important remark to place here is that I ONLY, I repeat ONLY, go for this play if I already have soul of rage on board. Because even though zeus is a great monster, its not worth sending all your OWN backrow too if you dont really need to. <strong>--- ratios ---</strong>  <strong>--- ratios side ---</strong> I blind 2nd after game 1. Just a few small comments below.  3x evenly matched - Best card in side. I literally don't think it is physically possible to OTK with this deck anyway, given the fiend lock you are in mostly. Generic af. 3x dark ruler - See comment above. Synergizes well with unchained of disaster too. Generic af too. 1x pankratops - Goes well with evenly matched, given you can tribute the pankratops if you really have too. Generic af too. 2x kaiju - Same reasoning as dark ruler no more. I chose wind kaiju because I hate wind barrier statue. --- ratios side ---"

I will get straight to it with this one.  The fishborgs, along with most of the main deck monsters, have ways of bringing back themselves or others, hence why I call this a recursion themed deck. The spells and traps support the low level water monsters with more recursion and protection, as well as some removal to fully benefit from effects that bring monsters back. The extra deck is where you will see the monsters that are actually threatening to your opponent, with monsters like Gishilnodon able to make serious dents if left unchecked. Lastly, aero shark can make use of the fishborg monsters banishing themselves, along with the other cards banishing your monsters, in order to inflict some mildly irritating burn (this should not be your primary game plan, it is more of a side option).  So that's it. There may be some room for improvement, so feel free to let me know what could be changed. Adios, nerds."

I'm still thinking if whether I should still play both the Shiranui Squire and Spectralsword Shade in the main deck since I also have a copy of ""Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi Manuscript"" to combo with Shiranui Squiresaga and to transcend into Sunsaga but for now it'll still remain in the deck until I figure out what cards would be good to replace them. As for the handtraps I do plan on running at least 2 copies of Ash Blossoms &amp; Joyous Springs even though I only have the 1 copy yet still unsure if whether I should bump it up to 3 copies or if I should also run 2 copies of Ghost Belle into the main deck rather than the side deck but other than that I'll just leave it as it is. In addition to handtraps, I also plan on running 3 copies of Infinite Impermanence although still unsure about the ratio for it since I've seen other people run only 2 copies of Imperm in their deck.  &nbsp;  As for the Extra Deck nothing really has changed much, although just recently I managed to pull a copy of Super Polymerization from the Maximum Gold set recently but I don't really have a super poly target at the moment so I'll just put it to the side until I find one. Lastly for the side deck I am running 2 copies of Ghost Belle and 1 copy of Ghost Ogre. I do also have a copy of Artifact Lancea which I also pulled from Maximum Gold but I'm not sure if I should also include it into the deck and the same goes for Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope you guys could give me feedbacks on how I could improve the deck as well as in terms of cards ratio, tech cards and etc."

So, I made this deck, utilizing (almost) all of the Red-Eyes archetype, excluding those dumb Zombie Dragons. I only included one <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon since I wanted to be able to use </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion for other things. Also, </a><a data-name=""Archfiend Black Skull Dragon"">Archfiend Black Skull Dragon isn't in this deck since I wanted to keep it strictly Red-Eyes, and it also was hitting the upper limit. Anyways, if you see any way to improve this deck, please put it into the comments, and I'll take it into consideration. Best of luck on your next duel!</a>"

Despias are Dark Fairy cards; just like Darklords, and they focus heavily on fusion summoning- which Darklords also rely on. This makes summoning The First Darklord incredibly easy. In addition to that, most of the Despia cards also have graveyard effects, which help you either protect, reuse, or gain resources. Darklords normally lack reliable consistency and recoverability, so the Despia engine makes up for that.  <span>III. Key Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - This is the main beater of the deck and can be used offensively as well as defensively. Aside from board wiping, he can protect Fairy monsters from targeted effects and also act as a secondary <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a>, or special summon from the hand. Your prime targets will likely be <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> from the grave or <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> from the grave or hand. You can also use this effect during your opponent's turn- which can combo with Kristya or <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> - One of the best searchers in the deck; searches a Branded spell or trap when normal or special summoned. 80% of the time you'll use this effect to search for <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> , the main fusion spell of the deck. He can also recur himself from the graveyard when one of your fusions are destroyed and negate one of your opponent's monsters for a turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - This is your main setup card for fusion, link, and xyz summons. Superbia's ability isn't a once per turn effect, so it's always a prime revival target for <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> and <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>. (Of note: A copied Darklord Contact from the graveyard will not proc Superbia's effect upon revival as the timing will be missed. In addition, the timing will also be missed if he is revived by The First Darklord during a <em>chain</em>).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - This card synergizes incredibly well with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> since it gives 2/3 material for <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> or a free <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> - A very multifaceted fusion card; can be activated during your turn or your opponent's turn since it's a quick-play spell. It does require a discard to activate- so make sure you save a card to discard to the graveyard.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> - Combos incredibly well with your other high level fusions; he reduces all monster ATK points to 0 aside from level 8 or higher fusion monsters. This card also interacts very strangely with <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> . When Quaeritis' effect ends, all monsters reset to their original attack points. In the case of Apollousa, her original attack points will reset to whatever it was when she was summoned. Meaning if she started with 3200 ATK and negated 3 times- lowering her ATK by 2400, by the end of Quaeritis' effect- it will temporarily lower her ATK to 0 and then reset back to 3200.</li> </ul> <span>IV. Tech Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - One of the most versatile cards of the deck, it can be used to set up or trigger combos. Your prime targets of this card will be <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> , <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> , and <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> - Does 2 things: searches a Despia monster when sent to the graveyard or banished and it can banish itself from the graveyard to recycle a Branded spell/trap to the hand. This will be your main target for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> since it turns Allure into a +1 once it's banished. Its search effect can be triggered off of <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> , <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> , <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> , <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> , and anytime it's used as fusion material.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> - Your main lockdown card for your opponent...as well as yourself; prevents all special summoning. Can recycle a fairy from your graveyard if you're able to special summon it with its effect- which isn't too difficult if you have <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> setting up your grave. You can also special summon Kristya from your hand if you control <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> - The only real handtrap that I run in this deck. It's good for baiting <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> or <a data-name=""Droll and Lock Bird"">Droll and Lock Bird</a> when most of your combo starters are spells or monster effects. On an opening hand, Gamma can help negate handtraps against: <a data-name=""Banishment of the Darklords"">Banishment of the Darklords</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> 's draw effect , <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> , <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> , <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> , and <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> 's graveyard effect. If you are able to use its effect, it'll also fill your field with fusion or link material. This card is also a Light monster, so it can be freely used for any Despian fusion if it becomes dead in the hand.  Some people might also prefer using <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> , but I don't like the idea of discarding 2 when you're fusion summoning a lot from the hand.</li> </ul> <span>V. Combos</span>  <strong><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> </strong> <ul>  	<li>Ideally you want to weed out the possibility of getting Ash Blossomed before attempting this combo. <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> does 2 things: it gives you a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target on your opponent's side of the field and it gives you a free search for a Darklord monster. As long as you can get a 3rd monster on the field (usually by reviving from the graveyard), you can get <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> very easily and then start to revive your monsters again. This combo is centered around The First Darklord's ability to swarm and protect your field rather than board wiping your opponent.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>As mentioned earlier, Quaeritis and Apollousa have a strange interaction when they're both on the field. This combo effectively resets Apollousa's ATK stat after using her negates. You want to use Quaeritis' ability to reduce all monsters' ATK to 0 after Apollousa uses all of her negates during the Main Phase. During the end phase, all monsters have their ATK reset to their <strong>original</strong> values. Meaning, if Apollousa had 3200 ATK when summoned and she used 3 negates to bring her ATK down to 800, you can use Quaeritis' effect to reduce her ATK to 0 temporarily and then when his effect ends- Apollousa will go back to her original 3200 ATK value. The goal is to loop Apollousa's attack infinitely so that you keep refreshing her ability to throw out negates. In order to add extra protection for this- you can link summon Apollousa using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> during your opponent's turn to make her immune to card effect destruction. 2 monsters with 0 ATK can't destroy each other by battle, but if you want more protection, you can also XYZ summon <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> so that your opponent is forced to target it for attacks.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>This combo is a bit niche, but can be both offensive and defensive. <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> allows you to tribute monsters from the graveyard instead of the field, which can help pave the way for things that can't be special summoned like <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a>. Offensively, it's an additional tribute summon that can bring things like Darklord Morningstar to the field or a second Darklord Superbia/Zerato for rank 8 XYZ plays. This also works around <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if you have it on the field since this wouldn't be considered a special summon. Defensively, <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> is also able to use its normal summoning quick effect during your <em>opponent's</em> turn, meaning you could tribute summon <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand after your opponent finishes summoning their monsters during the main phase. Afterward, you can use Morningstar's ability to swarm Darklords to your side of the field based on the number of effect monsters your opponent controls.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> &amp; Any Revival Effect</strong> <ul>  	<li>Like I mentioned before, Darklord Superbia's ability to revive an additional fairy from the graveyard <u>is not a once per turn effect</u>. Meaning you can continuously revive it from the graveyard and still proc its effect. The exception is if you copy a <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> from the graveyard using monsters like <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a>- as the timing for Superbia's effect would be missed. In terms of this deck, there are 2 ways to revive Superbia for its effect: <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> (from the hand) and <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> . If you're lucky enough to have access to both revival effects in a turn, your board will be well protected with extra deck monsters such as Hope Harbinger Dragon and Apollousa Bow of the Goddess .</li> </ul> <span>VI. Tips and Tricks</span> <ol>  	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> in hand, try to weed out Ash Blossom as quickly as possible depending on your strategy for the turn. <ol>  	<li>If you're planning to go the Indulged-Super Poly route, use other draw/search cards to bait such as <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> . Typically you really don't want to get Ash Blossomed on <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a>.</li>  	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> in hand, you could bait with Indulged Darklord and use a different combo depending on what you have in hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>This deck does a slightly better job of going first compared to second.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> is an insanely good card to use for setting up fusion summons, but keep in mind you are locked into nothing but fusions for the rest of the turn; you will not be able to go into links or xyz after playing this. <ol>  	<li>In addition, this is also a good card to have in the graveyard as it offers protection to your high level fusion monsters.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>When looking for monsters to banish for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, usually I'd go with <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> first and foremost, followed by more expendable dark monsters such as <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> , <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> , or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a> .</li>  	<li>Your general goal in every duel is to find a way to get to <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> so that you can search for <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> . <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> and <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> are both ways you can easily search for Aluber.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Watch how you play <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, it locks both you and your opponent from special summoning.</li>  	<li>Most of your Rank 8 XYZ plays will come from overlaying <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> . When detaching materials- detach Superbia first to continue chaining revives.</li>  	<li>When siding things out of your deck for more handtraps or disruptions, some easy targets to side out are <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> , <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a> , <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> , <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if playing against decks like Floowandereeze, and the PSY-Framegear package if it isn't working.</li>  	<li>I run a lot of 2-ofs in this deck, so some can be bumped up to 3 or down to 1 or 0 depending on what's needed. <ol>  	<li>If it's easily searchable I usually run 2 or lower, otherwise I run 3 if I really want to see something in my opening hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span><strong>Handtraps to look out for</strong></span>: <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> , <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> , <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> , and <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> .</li> </ol> <span>VII. Addressing Weaknesses </span> <ol>  	<li>This deck relies heavily on having cards both in your hand as well as your graveyard. Being unable to revive your cards from the graveyard because they were banished instead definitely hurts. It's for this reason that I put <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> in my side deck- it prevents monsters being banished during your opponent's turn, which helps your Darklords especially. Despia monsters in general don't mind being banished since some of their effects activate there, but it's better to have them in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>This should be self explanatory, but you're doing a lot of special summoning to go into your fusion monsters and links. If you notice that your opponent is running <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, you can stick to the main beaters of your deck without going into your extra deck. <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Zerato"">Darklord Zerato</a> can definitely hold their own on the field, especially if you have Darklord spells and traps in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>With all the draw and search power you're doing, it's inevitable that your opponent will catch on that the deck is very weak to <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> . This deck can play around Ash Blossom just fine, but you'll find yourself starved for resources if you get Droll &amp; Locked.</li> </ol> <span>VIII. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span> <ol>  	<li>In general, I try to avoid playing more than 3-4 handtraps since they tend to brick hands in Darklord decks. The notable 3-ofs that I have are <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> to prevent banishment, <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> to stop multiple searches and floodgates, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> for some more added protection going 2nd. <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> is also a good handtrap to side instead of Droll &amp; Lock Bird . <ol>  	<li>Both <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> can be used for Despia fusion summoning since they are both Light monsters.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>For the 2-ofs, I have <a data-name=""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"">Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju</a> for cards that are difficult to get rid of and <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> for more spell/trap removal. <ol>  	<li>Radian can be fodder for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> if needed and it can also be used for Despia fusion or <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> .</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>For 1-ofs, I go with <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> for more spell/trap removal and <a data-name=""Darklord Rebellion"">Darklord Rebellion</a> for more card destruction.</li>  	<li>Some other good options to put in your side deck are <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> , <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> , <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> , <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> , or <a data-name=""Rivalry of the Warlords"">Rivalry of the Warlords</a> .</li> </ol>"

OTK with minimal effort. Has a slight ol' skool feel to it.,"<span>What you are looking at might be the strongest deck I've ever constructed. At least for a deck that doesn't rely on absurd amounts of Special Summons, multiple <span>Link Summons</span>, a field full of monsters, and 15+ cards in the Graveyard on the first turn of the duel. That kind of meta-play ruins the game for me. This is a bit more old school, calling back to the olden days when <span>Ritual Monsters</span> were the big bad bosses you had to watch out for. There is a bit of <strong>XYZ Summoning</strong> that can be done here, and the <span>Ritual Monsters</span> included are fairly new, but for a deck that plays like traditional Yugioh back when the Extra Deck was called the <span>Fusion</span> Deck, it gets the job done.</span>  <span>The theme of this deck is the <span>Ritual Summoning</span> of 3 of the most broken <span>Ritual Monsters</span> I could find, each with ways to bypass the opponent's defenses and inflict damage in some sort of way. If the Rituals cannot be performed early for whatever reason, there are plenty of ways to get monsters with 2950+ ATK on the field. This review won't be as complicated as many of my others, as literally half of the deck prepares and initiates the Rituals. The other half is various types of support, such as Life Point protection, Graveyard recovery, and Special Summoning.</span>  <span>The 3 <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span>, and <span>Shinato, King Of A Higher Plane</span>. All are <span>Ritual Summoned</span> by <span>Advanced Ritual Art</span>, which requires you to send Normal Monsters from the Deck (rather than your hand) to the Graveyard, whose <span>Levels</span> equal <span>8</span>. (Each of the <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are <span>Level 8</span>). For the Rituals, you have access to 3 <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragons</span>, 3 <span>Rabidragons</span>, and 2 <span>Alexandrite Dragons</span>, all at <span>Level 8</span>, meaning you only have to send 1 monster at a time, with the latter being <span>Level 4</span>, requiring both. You'll likely never use both <span>Alexandrite Dragons</span> for a Ritual, but it is a possibility. Just be sure to choose <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span> as the monster when <span>Ritual Summoning Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, as it's effect requires that monster to be sent in order to activate. The other 2 have no specific requirement other than the <span>Level</span>.</span>  <span>As mentioned earlier, each <span>Ritual Monster</span> can punch through defensive lines and inflict damage in different ways. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, assuming it's effect has successfully been activated, upon declaring an attack can change the Battle Positions of as many of your opponent's monsters as you want, and upon doing so, their ATK and DEF becomes 0, and the dragon inflicts piercing damage through defending monsters. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span> just laughs at defense, and inflicts double piercing damage to your opponent's Life Points. The most I've managed to do with a single attack is 7200. So long as your Ritual was not negated, disposing of these monsters is very difficult for your opponent to accomplish, as these 2 dragons cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. They are also blessed with 3000 and 4000 ATK respectively. The final blue-card monster, <span>Shinato, King Of A Higher Plane</span>, inflicts damage equal to the ATK of whatever Defense Position monster it has just slain. Both dragons are objectively better, but I have managed to get an FTK using <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span> and <span>Shinato <span>multiple times</span></span>. You can run more copies of the dragons if you want, I just keep <span>Shinato</span> in here because he has been in this deck since it's birth, before I discovered the Chaos Dragons.</span>  <span>To prepare the Rituals which Summon these nigh unstoppable wyverns, we have the help of 3 very important monsters: <span>Sonic Bird</span>, <span>Senju Of The Thousand Hands</span>, and <span>Manju Of The Ten Thousand Hands</span>. These monsters are searchers, and can begin their search upon being Normal Summoned. <span>Sonic Bird</span> nets you one of your <span>Advanced Ritual Arts</span>, <span>Senju</span> grabs a Ritual Monster, and <span>Manju</span> can get you 1 of either. Always try to use <span>Sonic Bird</span> or <span>Senju</span> first, as <span>Manju</span> is more flexible, and has more hands, lol. You can also use the Field Spell <span>Ritual Sanctuary</span> to grab one of the necessary Ritual cards from the Deck by discarding a Spell Card. This card can also be used to recycle Spell Cards by Special Summoning either <span>Senju</span> or <span>Manju</span> from the Graveyard.</span>  <span>Now it's time to cover the <strong>XYZ Monsters</strong> lurking in the Extra Deck. Once your Ritual searchers have fulfilled their destiny, they can be used to <strong>XYZ Summon Daigusto Emeral</strong>. This crazy looking guy is the only <span>Rank 4</span> monster, and being Limited, we only have 1 copy. He has 2 effects you can choose from to activate once per turn. He lets you shuffle 3 monsters from the Graveyard into the deck to draw a card, or the more desired option, lets you Special Summon 1 Normal Monster from your Graveyard. Didn't you just send a <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span> there from the deck a few seconds ago? How convenient! The other 3 <strong>XYZ monsters</strong> are <span>Rank 8</span>, and can easily be Summoned by utilizing the over-abundance of Special Summoning <span>Level 8</span> monsters, which we'll cover next. <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> (geez, what a mouthful), is probably the least used, but can be used well when the situation arises. In a nutshell, it can negate a Spell and turn it into an XYZ Material once per turn, can change itself into the attack target by detaching 1 material, and can transfer ATK between <strong>XYZ Monsters</strong> if one dies. <strong>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> is probably the most used, and for good reasons. By detaching a material, you can negate the effects of all other Monsters on the field, and their ATK/DEF are reverted to their original states. If you do this, this monster gains 1000 ATK and can attack a second time if any of your opponent's card effects resolve. DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE YOUR <span>RITUAL MONSTERS</span> ACTIVE, unless you know 100% certain that you can secure the victory this turn. Lastly, we have <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</strong> (these names though...), who can be summoned by using <strong>Number 107</strong> as material. Doing this immediately gives this guy 3 materials to work with. This behemoth of a dragon has 4000 ATK, and an excellent destruction effect which is activated by detaching material.</span>  <span>Finally, let's break down the support cards and end this review. For Special Summons, we have <span>Ancient Rules</span>, which can be used to Special Summon <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span>, or <span>Rabidragon</span>, making the Battle Phase go smoothly, or setup <strong>XYZ Summons</strong>. We also have <span>Silver's Cry</span> and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span>, both of which can bring your <span>Level 8</span> Dragons back from the dead. Since <span>Silver's Cry</span> is a Quick-Play Spell, both of these can be used to scare your opponent during their Battle Phase just when they thought they had the upper hand. <span>Ritual Buster</span> completely shuts down your opponent's ability to do literally anything if you can successfully perform a <span>Ritual Summon</span>. <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> is used to stall while you obtain Ritual resources, and also protects your <span>Level 4</span> effect monsters from being killed; their low ATK's of 1400 make them easy targets, plus, you are better off using them to <strong>XYZ Summon Daigusto Emeral</strong>. The final card is <span>Dust Tornado</span>. Destroy some Spells/Traps.</span>  <span>If you're looking for a relatively simple to use deck that revolves around <span>Ritual Summoning</span>, then give this one a try. If you can get either Chaos Dragon out on the field, you'll either witness your opponent become a sweaty try-hard, or watch the life in their eyes fade in the most satisfying way imaginable, as they quickly realize that all they can do is play a monster and take the damage regardless of the position they place it in. This deck struggles against negate heavy decks, but in a more traditional, non-meta style casual play, this is one of the brutes. As always, feel free to share any ideas/strategies you may have, and I'll look into them.</span>"

Cross your fingers and hope Possessed Partnership doesn't get banished or negated so that you can revive your backrow. Or you can get some Solemn Judgments, Metaverse, and pitch Ichirin while running another Secret Village. I didn't because I want this deck to be cheap.  &nbsp;"
