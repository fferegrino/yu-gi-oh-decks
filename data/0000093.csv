What that means is... Altergeist has been granted a significant boost to its consistency, amongst other things.  In addition to the added consistency, you're no longer as prone to cards like D.D. Crow and Called by the Grave as you were with 1 Multifaker. You now have 3 copies of the heart of your Deck, and with new F &amp; L Lists seeing use in online competitive events (like the PPG Circuit's custom ban list) there has not been a better time to pick up Altergeist. _________  <strong>Key Altergeist Cards:</strong>  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a>: The engine that makes Altergeist work, Multifaker is critical to the snowballing of the Deck as a whole with its ability to get you to cards like Silq, for disruption, and Meluseek, for more advantage.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Meluseek"">Altergeist Meluseek</a>: A key piece in getting to your Fakers, and other Altergeist monsters (like Marionetter) down the line, Meluseek is also a versatile tool with its battle oriented removal effect.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Marionetter"">Altergeist Marionetter</a>: Inevitably you'll find yourself with some awkward faker-less hands, and when those hands creep up... the next best thing is Mari. With the ability to set Protocol or Manifestation, she can keep you alive during your next turn and even provide some much-needed interaction via Protocol. Aside from her Normal Summon effect, she also has another powerful effect. Mari's ability to send an Altergeist card to the GY to revive an Altergeist from the grave is incredibly powerful in the mid-late game, netting you additional Altergeist bodies.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Silquitous"">Altergeist Silquitous</a>: While it's not great to open, this card is undeniably important to the Deck's core strategy. Being a Quick Effect bounce is already really, really good. When you add the fact that this card can function as pre-errata Brionac for the Deck... it becomes even more insane. This card can not only bounce your opponent's cards to the hand, it returns your Altergeist Traps and monsters back to the hand for a 2-in-1 disruption, as you're also gaining future setup (i.e. setting up Faker again, getting another Marionetter set, getting multiple uses out of Kunqueary). Adding to its impressive repertoire of ability is yet another effect. If this card is sent to the GY, whether it be as Link Material or byway of interaction with your opponent, Silq can grab an Altergeist Trap from the grave.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Kunqueary"">Altergeist Kunqueary</a>: While nowhere near as consistently impactful as the rest of its brethren, Kunq can be pivotal in winning some matchups. Its ability to stop attacks, that is not once per turn, coupled with its on-summon negation can prove to be too much for some Decks.  • <a data-name=""Personal Spoofing"">Personal Spoofing</a>: Though it's not ""technically an Altergeist card"", it wouldn't be right to exclude spoofing from this list. Not only is it an additional 3 copies of Faker, and not only is it able to <em>trigger faker on its own</em> when activated... it can get you a whole host of other Altergeist monsters. Access to Kunq during your opponent's turn or Meluseek/Mari during yours are just some of the benefits this card can provide.  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Protocol"">Altergeist Protocol</a>: Likely your first set off Mari, Protocol is the 2nd inherent piece of disruption within the archetype - after Silq. On top of being a monster negate, that pops, it also has a nifty effect that prevents the activation of Altergeist effects. That's pretty absurd given how powerful some of the effects of the Altergeist lineup are, and this card is pretty handy given how many boss-caliber monsters exist in today's format (of which some are incredibly hard to out via monster effects).  • <a data-name=""Altergeist Manifestation"">Altergeist Manifestation</a>: Though it may not be as impressive as some of the other Altergeist cards, Mani definitely has a place within the group. With cards like Silq and Protocol, you're able to abuse Manifestation's unique design to get free reborns on either turn in addition to getting your Mani back to Deck or hand. These reborns can prove to be crucial as you may not have a Multifaker on field, or a Silq left in Deck to bounce with.  _________  <strong>Options to consider for Extra/Main/Side</strong>  Aside from ratio adjustments, there are a few cards that should be considered when building Altergeist.  • Extra Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>: It's able to trigger off your Hexstia, which will probably be even more relevant once turn 1 Hexstia becomes reality with the release of Altergeist Pookuery, and it's able to set up some Link 2 plays (assuming Linkuriboh is in your GY).</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>: It's still amazing all these years down the line. It's hard to out, it has the ability to remove some of the game's most annoying monsters, and it's pretty big. There's not much more you can ask for from Borreload, the issue is that it's not as fast or as impactful as some of the Extra Deck's other options (see Borrelsword &amp; Accesscode).</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Altergeist Primebanshee"">Altergeist Primebanshee</a>: Another Altergeist name that you may end up wanting if you manage to banish your 3 Hexstia. However this card's actual impact is debatable as Altergeist is not reliant on its Extra Deck... and this card's only real place is as another name.</p> • Main Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>: Needlefiber does exist in the TCG alongside Linkross, Verte Anaconda, and Union Carrier. Given the power and prevalence of Link 2+ monsters in the TCG format, it is definitely worth it to consider this card.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> / <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcaster"">Secret Village of the Spellcaster</a>s / <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> / <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> / <a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>: I'm putting a whole host of cards together because they all go together (though you do not have to play all together). If you opt to play a more Mystic Mine centered variant, as it has proven to be successful (see Gabriel Netz's 1st place LCS list), it's also pretty reasonable to invest Deck space into cards like Demise of the Land as well.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> / <a data-name=""Typhoon"">Typhoon</a>: Given the prevalence of Eldlich, and the rise of <em>Altergeist</em>, Storm Duster &amp; Typhoon might be worth playing in the main Deck instead of Side. They're Normal Traps, so they can trigger your Multifaker and be set off <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>, while removing threats in your opponent's backrow.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>: It's similar to <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a>, but you get to keep the opponent's monster.</p> <p>-&gt; Trap Trick: If you opt to play a higher Normal Trap Count this card is fantastic (it can get you Infinite Impermanence, maybe a <a data-name=""Different Dimension Ground"">Different Dimension Ground</a> or even a Compulse).</p> • Side Deck: <p>-&gt; Kaijus / <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: Same reason for why <a data-name=""Sphere Mode"">Sphere Mode</a> is in the Side. Altergeist isn't entirely reliant on its Normal Summon and it can't clear a break-my-board type of field if it DRNMs, <em>and</em> these cards are amazing at doing exactly that.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>: It's great in the mirror, versus Salamangreat, and a whole host of other strategies. It clears backrow or Attack Position monsters, and doesn't care if you have a bunch of set traps.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> / <a data-name=""Different Dimension Ground"">Different Dimension Ground</a>: For the more GY based strategies, these cards are great options.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: It hits Eldlich, it hits TCG Adamancipators, and it can hit rogue options like Thunder. Overall it's still a great option for Decks that banish to progress their gameplan.</p>"

Main combo starters are <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and <a data-name=""Diviner of the Heralds"">Diviner of the Heralds</a>. Both can setup at least one <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> plus some additional link and xyz fodder. When focusing on the rank 9 xyz plays, try to use <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a> as material as often as possible because its not banished when you detach it so you can bring it back multiple times (even in the opponents turn to pop a card).  Still testing around with extra and side deck, so please let me know any card that you think might miss."

Not only that, they can also pops card along the way. I chose earth, because its the best one so far cus it summons back its material means you can Halq if you used tuner as that beast fodder. The Halq combo we use is without Linkross (banned in OCG) and Borreload Savage (useless if summoned from Ascator package, I'll explain why Ascator package later) while maintaining at least 2 different attribute on field so our Teamwork of the Possessed extra effect is online.  Ascator package is used as it is a free Awakened-Possessed fodder and can go to lv8 synchro means you will have 2 disruptions online despite the synchro only restriction. Magicians Souls package works wonder too as it is an Awakened-Possessed fodder and can dump Gravekeeper's Shaman (1500 def spellcaster with gy lock, super good in meta matchup). Eda the Sun Magician (spellcaster, earth, 1500 def, all stats fits just perfectly) works okay-ish as it brings free monster from deck (Green Turtle Summoner, flip and pops monster, water for Eria link targeting opponent Halq for instant Accesscode). For earth extender, we use tuners like Adhara and Deskbot 001 (combo pieces). Instant Fusion is versatile on bringing which fodder we lack. Paleozoic Dinomischus is just great normal trap in general (removes Golden Lord permanently if given the chance), it makes Teamwork of the Possessed extra effect online cus it summons a water monster (giving that we dont summon the 1500 def water spellcaster), also it is a water for Eria. Trap Trick to fetch all the normal trap we play. The handtrap lineup is preferably tuner, and is an earth and/or spellcaster (ghost belle and veiler).  Extra deck we're using Draco Berseker instead of Borrel Savage cus its viable without link in gy. Linkuriboh + Secure Gardna is there to provide attribute variant for Teamwork of the Possessed (also it provides link 1 for Borrel Savage if you wanna use it). Selene + Accesscode good in late game as we run bunch of spellcasters (but only a handful of spell tho).  Side deck, Kaiju is the first thing to use cus it provides attribute you desire with using Slumber while breaking board (this deck has slow removal, trap, so we need faster removal going second). Scarlight is another great lv8 option via Ascator going second. Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched as faster removal too.  Cards to think of: Block Dragon is good but it requires you to run rocks for full advantage, at that point why not play adaman instead haha. Fossil Fusion lineup maybe good, but Weathering Soldier wont trigger if it's used as Awakened-Possessed fodder. The field spell is very gimmicky, because while its nice to have monster negation, it is mandatory and needs 1500 stats spellcaster it means most of the time it wont negate handtraps if we're on further Halq combo, the adding earth monster is bad too as the spellcasters are better than those 1500/200 earths.  &nbsp;  Pros: Fun to play (except the Halq part lol). Playstyle has multiple variant, call it backrow or combo. First turn board is okay-ish.  Cons: Struggle going second (almost guaranteed lose going second cus some of our play is flip monster or trap)."

Keep in mind that this deck is still a work in progress. My main goal with this deck is creating an aggressive Dark Magician deck that puts pressure on your opponent and forces them to waste resources. I also have plenty of replays showing this decks potential to be great."

There is no reason to deck thin in a toon deck.</em>  <em>*Only attack with BLS if you swing for game, removal is worth more in most cases.</em>  <em>*When you go first, there is no reason to select BLS as a summoning option for Page-Flip, select DM, Red-eyes and Masked Sorcerer.</em>  <em>*When you can special a toon, you usually do it in defense, because they can't attack anyways in most cases and it protects from Utopia Double.</em>  <em>*Use DM to search Terror, Briefcase or to special BLS (or Red-eyes when BLS is in hand). </em>  <em>*Bookmark can search Comic hand, but NOT Briefcase, keep that in mind because you will often have Bookmark+Table of Contents in your hand.</em>  <em>*Comic hand helps to swing for game.</em>  <em>*If you didn't quite make game with attacking, just use Crackdown or Comic hand to grab opponents monsters for a cowboy, or special Cannon soldier from deck with DM.</em>  <em>*Attack with masked sorcerer first to see your options after the draw.</em>  <em>*Don't use floodgates if not necessary! You don't want to be locked in on Summon limit or Tcboo against sky striker.</em>  <em>*Against Meta decks you wait and use Crackdown on essential combo pieces, like jet synchron, aleister, golden lord or an adamcipator tuner. Against rough decks you can use crackdown on the normal summon. In a lot of cases it ends their turn.</em>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The goal was to flex somewhere between the combo version and the straight Winda Turbo version, and running a lot of very specific interaction pieces to try and combat the format.  I wanted room for at least 9 interaction in the deck, to increase the odds of seeing a hand-trap. However, I also felt that Called By The Grave was essential for Eldlich the Golden Lord, which natively outs Winda. It seems like the matchup against Eldlich is super rough, so I wanted to run cards that were good against Eldlich or Adamancipator. With Eldlich heavy on the combo build and most decks incorporating a Needlefibre Package, Nibiru seemed like an obvious pick, particularly since it is a light monster. I went with D.D. Crow over Effect Veiler, mostly because it helps make Winda in a pinch, but also to snipe Golden Lords out of the GY while still stopping or stalling Adamancipator combos.  The Invoked engine is obligatory. These cards are very powerful, and have huge synergy in the fusion deck. 3 of all of them, and Terraforming to search Meltdown. After that its pretty ordinary numbers of Shaddoll cards for a deck without Desires. Juggler and Trick Clown are the last engine, they just help make the 1 card combos off of Shaddoll Fusion much better and give us light fodder to use to make Constructs or Mechaba.  I almost never go into Apkallone, but monster negation comes in clutch, and it's searching/sending ability is super useful as a floating effect. 2 Construct and 3 Winda are my usual numbers. I want to have multiple Winda for when 1 gets broken, and I like running 3 so that when people are sniping my extra deck with Lysogasm they have to go for all the Winda to deny me it. Mechaba is the main Invoked card, it gives us a good negate, even if its rarely an omni-negate. Purgatrio breaks boards, and Raidjin turns things face down. Almiraj and Gardna give us ways to get Aleister in the GY, while giving us access to 1 card Mechabas or Purgatrios that add Aleister to the hand. Cross Sheep makes the link 4 plays possible, with Borrelsword to OTK and Apollousa for some added negation, which also makes it possible to combo off to end on a board with Winda, Apollousa, and Mechaba.  3 Effect Veiler and 3 Impermanence are for combo decks, particularly Amamancipator. Sometimes you need all 9 hand traps. Cyclone and Lightning Storm are for Backrow decks, with Cyclone also coming in over Nibiru against Eldlich game 2. Dark Ruler No More is just a habit, it will allow the deck to break a lot of otherwise completely unbreakable boards even if it falls short against the main meta decks."

You would usually normal summon Stratos to search out a Plasma and then make the Vision hero combo starting from Faris. It is not the best at playing the long game so you would have to combo out everything in turn 1 and possibly OTK in turn 2 or 3. The deck isn't that good competitively or anything, Just a really fun deck to run.  &nbsp;  My Rating:  Attack: 5/5  Defense: 3/5  Consistency: 5/5  Stamina: 2/5  Strong Against: Dragun Spam, Cyber Dragon  Weak Against: Dragma, Sky Striker  Vision Hero Faris + Stratos Combo  Cards in hand: Faris, any other HERO for Faris to dump  Activate Faris, discard the other HERO and SS itself  Activate Faris, search for Increase and put it in the S/T zone  Activate Increase, tribute Faris to SS it  Activate Increase, SS Vyon from the deck  Activate Vyon, send Malicious to the GY  Activate Malicious, SS another one from the deck  Activate Vyon's other effect, search a Poly  Link off Malicious and Increase for a Cross Crusader  Activate Cross Crusader, SS Malicious from the GY  Tribute Malicious with Cross Crusader's effect and grab a Stratos to the hand  NS Stratos to search for Liquid Soldier  Poly the Stratos and Liquid Soldier for a Sunrise  Use Liquid Soldier for a draw 2 discard 1  Activate the Sunrise, search Miracle Fusion  Banish the Stratos and the  Liquid Soldier to make Absolute Zero  End your turn. If you have Plasma in your hand you can play it, but if you want to use its effect effectively you need to go second or wait a turn to nick a monster. If you want to you can tribute Absolute zero for Plasma but it will nuke all the monsters your opponent controls so you most likely wouldn't be able to use Plasma.  Overall this deck is a very aggressive deck that has the potential to completely wipe out boards and deal with troublesome threats with Plasma (He doesn't target!!!). Stay safe and have fun!"

Real unsure of this version, but I want those high chances to see my starters, so I'm trying this out. I tried to just slice out as many of the bricks as possible to run 3 Called + 9 Hand Traps so that we have a shot going second game 1. But I think the right way to play the FTK is to go all in on it and just try and kill people. Even slight changes in your chances of seeing a specific starter can make a big difference over a large number of games.  Since the originator of the FTK seems to have done calcs and determined the original 60 card deck had great odds of FTKing, even through hand traps. As a result, I changed my mentality on seeing 1 card starters, and decided to trim down on engines I thought were unnecessary while still running as many cards as I wanted. This also let me pump up the hand traps, making space for Gamma, meaning more high impact ways to secure a win going second. All the cards are also full combo with Chaos Space and One For One, and D.D. Crow is a viable normal summon to make Romulus with (Phantazmay is only here to be used as an extender, but hey, draw some cards off our opponent's plays).  I'm already back to 60. I kept upping the hand trap count to improve my odds of seeing 2 hand traps, even in a 60 card deck. To compensate I put back in extenders, White Rose Dragon, which makes seeing a dragon less bricky while still being an extender, and Monster Reborn, which is full combo with any normal summon of a Dragon. I'm also on 3 Exploderokket, so that even if we see 1 copy we don't brick out - we have to see 2 copies of explode or a total of 4 bricks to brick out. It will happen, but not very often.  Option 1 is FTK after making a Negate. Option 2 is the buster lock. Option 3 is Nibiru token + Borrelsword OTK, but this is largely irrelevant, since the deck FTKs much more consistently than it sees Nibiru. It is worth keeping in the back of your mind.  The normal Route for the combo is using Borrelsword or Borreload to fire off on Exploderokket to deal 2000 dmage after equipping your Borrel Dragon with Piscu. Then on your opponent's turn, you use the Tracer you get off of Explode to fire on Piscu, clearing a board full of plants created by Black Garden to deal 4000 damage. Then your Borrel Dragon fires off on the Explode Tracer summoned for the last 2000.  So hear me out, but I think this deck might actually be tier 0. I replaced Called By the Grace with World Chalice Guardragon. There are 2 reasons for this. The deck needs a lot of hand traps, because in the mirror you are screwed if you can't both prevent them from making Herald AND stop them from using Union Carrier. This takes at least 2 hand traps, and while all of our hand traps are relatively high impact, and capable of performing that role in multiples while being combo pieces, you might notice the highest impact of them in fact special summon themselves, and that Phantazmay doesn't do much in the mirror going second but dig for Nibiru. I think the built-in synergy of being a combo card that Brainstorms and protects your combos is reasonable, but these probably should be sided out in the mirror, or replaced with Imperm if this deck does become Tier 0. World Chalice Guardragon doesn't combo with Chaos Space, but it does perform full combo with any Dragon Extender, and just as importantly, it protects Union Carrier, which is really the whole plan of the deck when you think about it. It seems like the most vital place to attack the deck in the mirror, and it CAN protect from Imperm and Gamma, which Called cannot. It can also be an extender if you've pitched Driver (or made Needlefibre on your turn), not super relevant but it can come up.  3 Tracers comes up in a deck with no other level 4 Rokkets. Rokket Synchron still hasn't come up, so I'm running the third Tracer."

Mayakashi,shiranui,eldlich, Zombie world control.","This is a versatile, unpredictable, Zombie-fest. Only instead of relying on chance, I've catered it to be easily manipulated into one of 4 strategies. I've purposely stayed as on zombie theme as possible. At a glance some of the card choices, and some cards that I dont use (draganecro, rivalry, super poly to name a few) may seem odd. But, it's all for an easily manipulated flow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll name a few combos, but if you enjoy pure zombie bashing like I do you will get the hang of it hopefully. At first I would brood over turns, having the starters for 3 separate valuable combos in hand with extenders already on field and balerdroch waiting to negate ash. But, after a while you learn what's useful when. I've worked on this for roughly 2 months now.  Made of what I physically own, though I have ALOT of zombies. It could use another golden lord, and it wouldn't hurt to ditch haquero and book of life for 3x called by sided.  All....ALL thoughts,recommendations, and criticism is welcomed. Help me make this deck be fun, versitale, and meta viable.  Please keep in mind it is a pure zombie deck. I think bomber dragon is my only non zombie and I put him in here to break well established boards. I was noticing the deck lacked a dark hole or raigeki wipe. But, I wanted to keep the trend of not relying on chance alot.  &nbsp;  Now onto the strats.  Monster manipulation through the multiple ""send from deck to gy"" cards and thinning if you chose to activate each eldlixir and golden land card the moment you can, then banish asap to cycle em through.  Extra deck choices: mayakashi and shiranui full synchro 1 ofs except for yoko, its strangely easy for this deck to pop out synchros, zombie-skull for either extra punch, to force an offensive response if your opponent is turtleing or to rank up with another tuner.  Links: sucker for draw power and to start the link ladder, savior ""sends"" dakki if you wanna do the ole mayakashi roulette or mezuki for SS from GY or gozuki for SS from hand or glow up bloom for SS from deck or if you dont have zombie world out yet (it's out by turn 2 for me consistently) then send banshee. I've also been crafty before, had supremacy and Bayonater on field beside dakki, opponent thinks I'm going for mayakashi, link bayonater and supremacy bring out bomber dragon activate spectralsword in gy with spiritmaster, summon samuraisaga and destroy opponents face up (alternatively I could have used spectralsword with bayonater and double juked into mayakashi roulette avoiding bombers zones) but then tune dakki w samuraisaga boom you just went full into a whole other 2 boss monsters that weren't mayakashi.  I'm definitely going to make this too long but, I'm committed and excited to share this with the community. I've searched so hard seeing decks that where good but not GREAT and upon the realization that a more than casual pure zombie deck was possible because of the hidden summoner and secret slayer support I buckled down, my phone and laptop didnt give me a solid look, something about laying the cards out in front of me helps me visualize ratios and patterns. Then I take it to the screen and trouble shoot. Anyways..  Spell choices: I'll address the elephant, mayakashi winter is bricky, but really read it and look back through what I've compiled, 2 Yoko's, 2 spirit master, mid game that's an easy 2 destroys or I mean you get it there are just so many routes you just judge the board and focus on keeping hand advantage. It's easy to use your entire hand first turn and establish a pretty strong board, it's even easier for your opponent to slap a nibaru down and grab a quick win for his deck. Also, winter sends dakki from field for a plus 1, if you can SS a lvl 3,5,7,or 9 synchro then you got a hitter. I have 2 allures for draw power because its euphoric to then use samsara to pull em from banish to deck AND DRAW AGAIN. That's crazy... use 2 effects only sending to gy allure so only loosing 1 card, in order to return 2 banished tuners to deck (easily searched) and draw 3 cards. Mayakashi return is situational as well, use it to send one of the monsters or pull em to hand or search for winter if you already went through the roulette. 1 foolish burial and 1 monster reborn, because that's how I got the brick ratio down....honestly.....running 3 zombie world I've sided a terraforming and have 2 banshees. You will learn (if you dont currently know) what decks you want to have zombie world out first turn for and what decks to side out both banshees and a copy of it to improve another strat for. Also, if you ""send from deck to grave"" eldlich you can use his effect easy, then with him on the field all of those confining spells that can only pull him out become doorways to options. Eldlixirs SS from hand deck and gy, (depending which you use) and have 0 restriction as long as you got eldlich on field.  Onto traps: samsara has saved this deck from loss more than I ever imagined it could when I threw it in on a whim. This card is soooooo underrated, it can banish 1 of yours from field, and there are plenty of reasons why that's good and you are safe for that turn. Even if your opponent msts it or something, it also returns your tuners and synchros to the deck and nets (if you choose synchros you dont shuffle and therefore do not draw).  The golden land monsters are basically my zombie version of Called by and a clean ""destroy 1 face up"" as you can see there are multiple ports for card destruction. I've actually used Conquistadors summon to destroy a gozuki I had summoned for a ""sends"" and got to SS and banish from gy. The eldlixir of scarlet sanguine, I hate this but.....they're gonna be bait. Idk why but, people see the eldlixir trap (sanguine) and just have to negate or destroy it while set. Its gonna happen over and over just start telling yourself its bait now, it's the best one of all of them bc it SS from deck n gy but, I've almost never gotten to resolve it. <ol>  	<li>Hmmm, side deck stuff: some double and triple prints to bend the deck in-between matches so if you face-off against a previous onlooker you can throw them off, ghost sister and swallow slash where my answer to avoiding nibaru, and it's all beneficial. Fraulein is a special card, he can steal magician girls or dark magicians to keep em away from their supports, or empower an already ridiculous shogunsaga for a HUGE beater, or, to keep that extender or balerdroch or whatever on the field for a turn longer. Typically I'll side in ghost sister if I'm going to also run fraulein to recover some of the LP. The opponent will either go off anyway hoping they have enough turns to dwindle you back down, half combo just enough to keep em in the game which typically is still a nice chunk and I've found is the least successful response unless your running low atk, and the dreaded third response, my favorite one, they stick to normal summon and end turn. Now you have nothing for lifepoints, and your card worked. You wanted to halt special summons and that you did, what the opponent dosent know is that you wanted this, you had drawn ghost sister first turn and awaited the right time to strike..turn 7..combo into bomber, attack and use fraulein, pay all but 100 LPs, opponent trys to negate HA! Flip solomn judgement and cut 100 to 50, attack with all your might, differential LP damage on top of the opponents monsters atk reflected, and if they had created one of those boards they think is unbreakable, then summon fraulein 1 spot over and wipe the field still judgmenting a negate.</li> </ol> In summary, i prefer choice to chance, and zombies over all in this game I've been playing my whole life.      I look forward to the responses that will aid to improve the deck. But, I urge you to get a small feel for it first, bc it's so fun to just decide what kinda deck you are gonna play, stop mid-combo and link into something that starts a combo for another strat....i understand I'm being ambitious with a ""Quad Splash"" but, there is something here.  This deck took on, adamancipater and skystriker with victories. Orcust, as long as you hold out until they setup and then find a way to wipe it (many destroys and banishes or bomber) then throw down lethal. Shaddolls hate zombieworld/balerdroch combo, if you can pop out 1 or 2 more negates (hand traps or solomn, etc.) Then setup the mayakashi roulette its typically over the next few turns, if They overpower or effect kill your skeletal mayakashi you get to unwind into yoko and destroy a card saving your remaining negates and purposely letting that turn pass to refresh balerdrochs negate.  &nbsp;  Monster: Shiranui Swordmaster x1 Tsukahagi, the Poisonous Mayakashi x1 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring x3 Jack-o-Bolan x1 Shiranui Spectralsword x2 Doomking Balerdroch x2 Shiranui Squire x2 Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi x1 Bayonater, the Baneful Barrel x1 Uni-Zombie x3 Gozuki x1 Necroworld Banshee x2 Shiranui Spectralsword Shade x1 Mezuki x2 Glow-Up Bloom x2 Shiranui Solitaire x3 Eldlich the Golden Lord x1 Shiranui Spiritmaster x2  Spell: Allure of Darkness x2 Mayakashi Return x1 Zombie World x3 Cursed Eldland x1 Mayakashi Winter x1 Eldlixir of Black Awakening x2 Foolish Burial x1 Monster Reborn x1 Eldlixir of White Destiny x1  Trap: Conquistador of the Golden Land x2 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine x2 Shiranui Style Samsara x1 Huaquero of the Golden Land x1  Extra: Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi x2 Tengu, the Winged Mayakashi x1 Topologic Bomber Dragon x1 Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi x1 Vampire Sucker x1 Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi x1 Shiranui Squiresaga x1 Shiranui Samuraisaga x1 Shiranui Sunsaga x1 Archfiend Zombie-Skull x1 Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi x1 Shiranui Shogunsaga x1 Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy x1 Avendread Savior x1  Side: Book of Life x1 Shiranui Style Swallow's Slash x1 Vampire Fraulein x1 Conquistador of the Golden Land x1 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine x1 Cursed Eldland x1 Plaguespreader Zombie x1 Solemn Judgment x2 Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood x1 Terraforming x1 Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion x2 Glow-Up Bloom x1 Huaquero of the Golden Land x1  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Side deck is personal feel free to build it as you want.  Ritual monsters are just good extenders in the deck with situational great impact. You can cut them and the ritual cards for other extenders like backup secretary or balancer lord. If you do don't forget to cut Cyberse with aswell, you would add for example a Cyberse Quantum Dragon.  For budget options you can cut dark ruler for handtraps or disruptions. Acesscode is very expensive but it is the best option we have by far as we are limited to cyberse monsters (due to reborn). You can try with avramax or zeroboros but it won't be as efficient as Accesscode Talker. Cynet Mining is also quite expensive but i think it is mandatory to reduce brick."

If going first, you can set up an Apollousa for 3 or a Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If you're going second, you want to make Borrelsword or Accesscode Talker and go for game.  <strong>How does this deck work?</strong>  Every card in this deck falls into one of three categories: Starter, Thunder Dragon, and Extender. Any starter + any Thunder Dragon + Any extender can end on a Titan and a LINK-4.  <strong>Bread and Butter Combo: </strong>  Given that you have an starter, a Thunder Dragon, and an extender in hand, the combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Activate your starter and send Thunder Dragonroar</li>  	<li>If the Roar is in grave, use your extender to banish it. Once banished, special summon a Thunder Dragondark</li>  	<li>Link your starter and the Dark into a Cross-Sheep</li>  	<li>Search Thunder Dragon Fusion with the Dark (If you already have it in hand, you can search for a Thunder Dragonhawk to extend even further, or a Thunder Dragon to pop cards with Titan)</li>  	<li>Use the Thunder Dragon card in your hand's effect (or any other way to get it out of your hand), then use Thunder Dragon Fusion to make Titan.</li>  	<li>Use Cross-Sheep's effect to resurrect your starter.</li>  	<li>You now have enough monsters on the field to go into Apollousa for 3, Crusadia Avramax, Borrelsword, or Accesscode.</li> </ol> <strong>A three card combo? That's too much</strong>  Since the entire deck is comprised of cards that fall into these three categories, it's relatively easy to get the pieces you need. Also, some cards have the ability to function as multiple types of cards (ie. Thunder Dragonhawk is both a Thunder Dragon and an extender)  <strong>Why are you running Lightsworns? Dangers are better</strong>  You can run Dangers, but you might not have enough space to run them all in a 40 card deck. In testing, I found that the deck's biggest issue was getting enough cards in the grave on the early turns, and the Lightsworn engine helps with that greatly. You also need cards in the grave for your extenders, and this is the best engine to do so. Raiden is also a light, which means you can banish it or pitch it to Chaos Space."

My name is Maximillion ... Should you want to master the Toon Archetype, and enhance your Yu-Gi-Oh knowledge, please feel free to","<span><strong><u>Nostalgy Time - An extensive guide on how to play Toons - June 2020</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Intro</u></strong><strong><u>duction:</u></strong></span>  The Toon Archetype got a huge boost recently, with the release of the Toon Chaos Booster Box. New additions to the Toon Series would certainly have made Pegasus proud, and might also have reconciliated the fans with Konami. Long neglected by the firm, the archetype was withering away, filled with cards that were far too old, and therefore full of constraints that no longer make sense in today’s metagame. Fortunately, Konami brought out the heavy artillery to the delight of the early fans, offering us some crazy search engines and one boss monster to fuel the deck!  <strong>Warning:</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the deck may be very fun to play at locals, it is far from being able to compete against any real Tier 1 meta deck. Some would say it could fall in the Rogue category, at most. That being said, let’s dig in!  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/a5/ToonKingdom-JP-Anime-GX-NC.png"" alt=""Pegasus at its finest!"" width=""467"" height=""334"" />  <span><strong><u>In-Depth Analysis:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Amazing consistency thanks to the addition of <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> and <a data-name=""Toon &lt;a data-name=&quot;Page-Flip&quot;&gt;Page-Flip&lt;/a&gt;"">Toon </a><a data-name=""Page-Flip"">Page-Flip</a>. <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> remains one of the best searchers of the entire game, basically enabling you to pick any Toon card from your deck, while not even being limited to one activation per turn.</li>  	<li>Ability to easily summon ignoring the summoning conditions, which is abused by the deck’s strategy.</li>  	<li>The powerful field spell <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a> acts like a protection for all your creatures.</li>  	<li>Dealing Direct Damage: your Toons can pass through any threatening body, as they can attack your opponent directly (as long as Toon World / Kingdom is on the field).</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Weaknesses: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Lack of Explosiveness: there is no such thing as huge combos involving tons of summons with the Toon archetype. You won’t be able to set up any kind of lockdown or establish a powerful end board with multiple negations. That is the main reason why I find the “Going 2nd"" approach for the deck way more effective.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a> being one the greatest strengths of the deck, it also appears to be a double-edged sword! Indeed, the deck relies heavily on this sole card: all the strategy depends on your capacity to put it on the field. Should this card be countered (destroyed / banished / negated), you will have a hard time trying to recover.</li>  	<li>Draw Power: there is no real Toon draw engine worth playing in the deck. That is why <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> comes in handy.</li>  	<li>Bricks: to a lesser extent, some Toons can end up being dead draws in hand as most of of them have a high level. One notable example is <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Toon Dragon"">Red-Eyes Toon Dragon</a> that we often do not want to draw (not always the case though).</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/40700000/Pegs-vs-Kaiba-with-Blue-Eyes-Toon-Dragon-maximillion-pegasus-yu-gi-oh-40700066-502-380.jpg"" alt=""Toon Blue-Eyes the left behind (So charismatic yet so bad!)"" width=""420"" height=""318"" />  <span><strong><u>Stra</u></strong><strong><u>tegy:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Going 1st:</u></strong></span>  Do not overcommit on the board, try to protect your Kingdom, and set up <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a> (search it). Ideally, you would end up with one big toon on board (Red-Eyes, <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a> (BLS) or <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a><a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician""> (DM)</a>), Toon Kingdom, Toon Terror, and one Bookmark in grave. If you get lucky, you will also end up with a hand trap for some more negates. This end board might not look that impressive, but with one negation and one Kingdom protection (Bookmark), you can still manage to survive your opponent’s next offensive. Keep in mind this deck is built to go 2nd. If you go first, you just want to slow down your opponent in order to get a chance to break his board and overwhelm him on your 2nd turn.  <span><strong><u>Going 2nd: </u></strong></span>  This is where the fun begins!  Try to interrupt their combos with hand traps. <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a>, <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> are obviously good targets to consider by the time I am writing this. Get rid of your opponent’s board with <a data-name=""Evenly Match"">Evenly Match (EM)</a> if you open it. Based on the state of the board, it is up to you to decide whether you need to bait your opponent with EM or another card instead. <strong>Choose wisely which card you want to resolve the most. </strong>Remember that you do not really care if your rival has big bodies on board as your toons can attack directly and are indestructible thanks to the field spell. On the other hand, you would rather want to get rid of backrows or sneaky Effect monsters that could potentially endanger your Kingdom.  <strong>Then, you must set up your Castle at all costs because without this cartoon-like fortress, your monsters are weak and powerless. </strong>  <strong><u>Main Strategy / “Combo”:</u></strong> Extend on board. <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a> + DM and any other Toon card in hand --&gt; Normal Summon Black Stone, Special Summon (SS) Red-Eyes --&gt; SS DM with Red-Eyes Effect --&gt; SS BLS with DM effect sending the Toon card to the grave. You can overlay DM + Red-Eyes for a Rank 7 play. For instance, Xyz <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon</a> in order to revive Red-Eyes with its effect, or <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a> to destroy a card on the field. Use BLS to push for damage or banish another card.  <strong><u>Strategy 2 / Emergency plan:</u></strong> Effective against backrows deck. If you did not draw EM, and have to face a board full of set cards / or annoying creatures, you will want to play as much BLS as possible, one after the other. Let’s say you summoned the first one through Page-Flip, use its effect (banish), then SS another one from hand, tributing the BLS on the field, banish another card, and repeat this operation one last time. You end up with only one BLS on field, but you banished 3 cards. <strong>The BLS banishing effect is a soft “once per turn”, take advantage of it!</strong>  The entire deck is very searchable and reminds me a bit of the Nekroz search engine. Thanks to Bookmark and Toon Table, you will be able to consistently select which tactic to use in order to adapt to your opponent, as you will have access to any specific Toon card. Hence, depending on the situation you are dealing with, there is plenty of options available, which I describe below:  <span><strong><u>Toon Toolbox: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Facing a powerful Link Monster? Use <a data-name=""Toon Cyber Dragon"">Toon Cyber Dragon</a> to Megafleet your opponent’s extra monster zone.</li>  	<li>Search for <a data-name=""Toon Harpie Lady"">Toon Harpie Lady</a> if you want to quickly get rid of a Spell or Trap card.</li>  	<li>Any useful card in your opponent’s grave? Search for <a data-name=""Mimicat"">Mimicat</a> and steal it.</li>  	<li>Any annoying monster on your opponent’s field? Go for <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a> instead … and steal it!</li>  	<li>Want to set up an omni negate? Search for <a data-name=""Toon Terror"">Toon Terror</a>.</li>  	<li>Need to summon a big boy? Activate <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> --&gt; always choose BLS + Red-Eyes + DM. Then, depending on which one is randomly picked, adapt your following play / strategy.</li>  	<li>Need an Extender ? Search for <a data-name=""Toon Cyber Dragon"">Toon Cyber Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Toon Harpie Lady"">Toon Harpie Lady</a>.</li> </ul> <img src=""https://pm1.narvii.com/6101/edb0634fc3b1189a67506d54af2ace35d4ececc3_hq.jpg"" alt=""The creepy ... shadow cat ?"" width=""443"" height=""332"" />  <span><strong><u>Rational behind Ratios:</u></strong></span>  3x BLS: Best Toon so far, nothing to add, great stats, great effect, relatively easy to summon.  2x Red-Eyes: you do not want to open it, it is a brick. You only want to SS it through Black Stone.  3x Black Stones: combo starter. You want to open it. This is your only normal summon. It gets you Red-Eyes which gets you another Toon from hand in return.  3x DM: you want to open it in order to SS it through Red-Eyes effect. If you need some space for a specific tech, you may remove one. I am still debating on the right ratio.  1x Comic Hand / Harpie Lady / Mimicat / Cyber Dragon / Toon Terror --&gt; you do not want to open them, you want to search one if needed for a very specific purpose.  3x Evenly Matched: very strong going 2nd card + you usually do not set up big board going first, so you can still get good value from it in case your defense gets wiped out.  3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> / <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: really depends on the meta, any hand trap will do. Main objective is to disrupt your opponent's play to contain their board.  <span><strong><u>Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Always use Extravagance first &#x1f609;</li>  	<li>If you do not have another Bookmark in hand, always Toon Table into Bookmark into another Toon card in order to set up your Kingdom’s protection in grave ! <strong>Very important!</strong></li>  	<li>DM and Red-Eyes cannot attack directly the turn they are summoned. <strong>BLS CAN</strong>.</li>  	<li>Toon Table cannot search Mimicat &amp; Comic Hand, <strong>Bookmark CAN</strong>.</li>  	<li>If Page-Flip or Bookmark gets negated, please re-read this again and again: ""<strong>If you negate the activation of a card that can only be activated once per turn then you may activate another copy of said card again in that same turn.""</strong></li>  	<li>What do you want to see in your opening hand going 2nd? Bookmark / Page-Flip / Kingdom &amp; Field searchers (<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> / <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a>) / Table / Black Stone &amp; DM / Evenly Matched / Hand Traps</li>  	<li><strong>Do not forget to use Black Stone Effect in Grave !</strong></li>  	<li>You can swap the Evenly Matched playset for 3 <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a> if you face too many spam / combo decks --&gt; You can steal the token with comic hand and swing with it for ... maybe game ?!</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Other Toon cards to consider: </u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Gemini Elf"">Toon Gemini Elf</a> is tempting because of the discard effect, but too slow as they cannot attack the turn they are summoned.</li>  	<li>Similarly, <a data-name=""Toon Masked Sorcerer"">Toon Masked Sorcerer</a> drawing effect looks nice at first sight, but it also requires one turn to be activated + 900 ATK is really bad.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Ancient Gear Golem"">Toon Ancient Gear Golem</a> if you wish to increase chances to be able to summon BLS.</li>  	<li>Potentially <a data-name=""Toon Mermaid"">Toon Mermaid</a> x3 if you add <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> to your Extra deck, but then, you would change the whole deck structure. You would need to switch to an Xyz Rank 4 focused deck and adapt your extra deck accordingly. It is not optimal at all in my opinion. And Mermaid alone is full garbage, the card being too old.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Briefcase"">Toon Briefcase</a> if you want to improve your Going First plays.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Toon Mask"">Toon Mask</a> is too slow, not worth the effect.</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/df/Yugioh036.png"" alt=""She's so cute!

Megafleet is really strong going 2nd against most decks, and your opponent will never play around on game one if he does not know your deck.</li>  	<li>1 <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> because sometimes, you have an extra copy of Black Stone in hand, and also because Pegasus / <a data-name=""Relinquished"">Relinquished</a> you know? More serioulsy, people are not used to it yet and somet players forget to play around. You could replace it for any powerfull link 3 monster such as <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a>, or another Link 1 <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj for extra-protection</a>.</li>  	<li>Combo <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> + <a data-name=""Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle"">Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle</a> = revive back opponent's Halqifibrax with Eria, link into Accesscode.
