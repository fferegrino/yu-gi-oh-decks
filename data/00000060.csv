I, myself, was caught up in finding a deck that wants level 3 normal monsters as part of its engine, but Prima Materiactor changes all of that. Instead, you're left with a tight engine that stacks and adds whatever piece you need to keep your deck moving.&nbsp;<br /><br />In virtual world, the level 3 access keeps you in line with the deck's core game-plan while adding a very recursive draw engine with Exgard adding whatever pieces you need back to the hand. Small world is a must have in the deck as any card in the deck is a bridge to any other card in the deck.</p>"

World + Chaos Beast + Carbon,"<p>Greetings! Once upon a time, I made <a href=""/deck/bestower-of-countdown-534098"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>this deck</strong></a> thanks to Princess and win with Final Countdown. Now, I did it with Chaos Beast instead because what if Princess is banned? Let's find out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8Pc9OIlBQA"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Bring forth Tethys by replacing Capricious/Aces/Corobane and draw your whole deck...</p><ul><li>Whenever you draw a Fairy, reveal it to draw another card with Tethys. You can keep it going until you can't draw anymore.</li><li>If you hit non-Fairy, you stop movement. So, continue with Ixchel and alike to trigger Tethys again.</li><li>Always use ""Arcana Force XV"" in-hand to fetch what would be otherwise brick by Tethys, which is ""Light Barrier"".</li><li>Know that card draw has to be caused by an effect, not as cost, in order to draw a card with Tethys. For example, using ""Upstart Goblin"", seen in Side Deck, won't do any help for Tethys but ""Into the Void"" will. Remember this rule well.</li></ul><p>2) If Tethys + Aces are together, Link Summon Insulator with them. Otherwise, place Rain and Lebellman onto Pendulum Zones to Pendulum Summon 2 x Carbon + Capricious + Orange. Also, activate ""Final Countdown"" and ""Light Barrier"".</p><p>3) XYZ Summon Starring Knight with 2 x Carbon as materials. Then, use Knight to Special Summon The World and pick the outcome as <strong>heads</strong>&nbsp;thanks to ""Light Barrier"" to be able to skip your opponent's turn by sending two monsters you control to GY.</p><p>4) Synchro Summon Chaos Beast with Capricious + Orange. At that moment, Carbon asks you to shuffle itself on top of your Main Deck, which is essential to not deck-out for 20 turns forward.</p><p>5) End your turn and use The World to send Beast + Knight to GY, in order to be able to do what was explained in #3. When it's your move, bring forth Carbon + Beast for The World and repeat until you win with Final Countdown...</p><ul><li>With many LIGHT and DARK monsters available at your arsenal, reviving Beast won't be an issue, provided that you use Beast to retrieve banished monsters into your hand. Afterwards, Pendulum Summon them and use these as resources for The World.</li><li>No matter what you do, don't forget to send Carbon to GY for The World at all costs to not deck-out by accident.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Darklord Ixchel"" can be found either within ""The Opening Act of an Apocalypse"" or ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Trickstar Corobane"" can be found within ""Essence of Flora and Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Tokusano Shinkyojin"" can be found within ""Crystal Realm Defier"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Chicken Game"" can be found within ""The Most Dangerous Race of the Cosmos!"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Final Countdown"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""World Soul - Carbon"" can be found either within ""Hope Sprouting in the Spring Breeze"" or ""The Ones Who Serve Ra"" Secret Packs to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 360 SR and 240 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

I can't say if it's any better than pure Sky Striker (it probably isn't), but it DOES feel a whole lot better than pure Argostar, and I even managed to sneak in a godawful Full Armor package purely for the chance to do something more useful with the Argostar Rank 4. I'm surprised by how many hands this is actually able to start off of, and none of the Argostars ever stay in the Main zones for long enough to matter.<br /><br />If you're actually going to build this pile, please do yourself a favor and rip out the whole XYZ Full Armor package and replace it with Silhouhatte Rabbit or S:P or anything more generically useful.

This was simply too much for the main deck fiendsmith cards. Being able to turn the Ki-sikil link monsters makes the extra fiendsmith cards not as neccesary because of how easy it is to make requiem in hands that dont have any fiendsmith cards in them.</p><p>Next change i made was removing the Abominable Unchained Soul. there really wasnt a reason to include it in the deck, it almost never came up and there are better cards to search with Yama or the unchained spell, it also doesnt have the ability to make Caesar unlike the other good unchained cards.</p><p>With this newfound space in the deck I was able to slot in 3 imperms. Having ash blossom as the only handtrap was a major throw. The deck is able to play through interuption pretty well, but it definetly struggles against a fully formed end board that i wasnt able to stop because i didnt draw a handtrap.</p><p>A minor change I made was removing 1 Lil-la from the main deck for a Ki-sikil Frost. Normaling Frost can also act as a starter just like normal Ki-sikil (albeit a weaker one.) Also, having Frost in your hand when your normal summon Lil-la gets interrupted, or searching it with sunny snitch when you already opened a Live☆Twin. The utility of this card is definetly something i looked over when I was building the original deck.</p><p>The final change I made was taking a solemn out of the side deck for a copy of the big Evil★Twin main deck monster. At one point during testing I was struggling to find a way the deck could get over larger monsters. Something that worried me was my opponent making a giant unaffected tower that i had no out for. This was my best solution for that. I think that 4400ATK was plenty and you only need one copy of it because Trouble Sunny gives quick access to it paired with non-destroying non-targeting removal.</p><p>If I you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I check my decks often, so I will most likely respond.</p>"

The basic combo is Regenesis Archfiend -&gt; Regenesis -&gt; Regenesis Lord -&gt; Summons itself banishing Archfiend then sets Birth from deck. This interruption seems relatively little, but augmented by Fiendsmith, Kashtira and handtraps, it can be difficult for your opponent to face, especially since all three engines recur everyturn. This deck also has 12 handtraps/staple slots, making it easier to play 1st and second. You can also beat over monsters relatively easily, since most monsters in this deck are freely summoned and have 2000+ ATK.<br /><br />The Extra Deck are mostly cards for the Fiendsmith deck, and can be changed anytime to suit your playstyle. Honestly, this deck can do without the entire Fiendsmith package and can be played purely with Kashtira! The Extra Deck can be used as fodder for Pot of Extravagance or Super Polymerization in that deckbuild.<br /><br />Kashtira and Regenesis also has the funny distinction of having their ace cards named ""Birth"" so you can call this deck ""double birth control!""

This deck focuses on getting Dark Magician and its fusions out on the field using the Primite engine to boost that. You could easily trim some cards for more handtraps/links if you want it to be a little more competitive, but I wanted to keep the main focus on being able to actually play Dark Magician and its fusions instead of playing 10 link cards.

This isn't your average Labrynth build; we've twisted the opulent halls with the shadowy allure of Diabellstar and her Sinful Spoils. Lure your opponent into a web of disruptive traps and cunning hand traps, orchestrated by the elegant Lady and Lovely Labrynth. But beware, for this castle hides more than just welcome mats. Unleash the unexpected might of the Azamina family, morphing and evolving in the Extra Deck to deliver devastating blows and control the flow of battle. From the regal Moa Regina to the shadowy Mu Rcielago, their presence adds a unique and powerful dimension to the Labrynth strategy. Fool your foes with Metalfoes Fusion and the Sinful Spoils package, loading your Graveyard for explosive plays with Transaction Rollback and the ever-present threat of Eradicator Epidemic Virus.

Prepare for a Labrynth experience unlike any other &ndash; where beauty and brutality intertwine, and the unexpected reigns supreme.

This isn't your grandma's Harpie deck &ndash; it's a whirlwind of Simorgh synergy, soaring to new heights with the cunning of the Mist Valley and the relentless aggression of their winged allies. Weave through a storm of Harpie Ladies, each a vital piece in a symphony of destruction, while the enigmatic Simorghs manipulate the winds to summon colossal threats and disrupt your opponent's every move. From the explosive potential of ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" to the lockdown power of ""Harpie's Feather Storm,"" this deck commands the skies. Utilize the search power of ""Harpie Harpist"" and ""Harpie Perfumer"" to assemble your avian armada, then launch into devastating combos with ""Harpie Channeler"" and ""Elegant Egotist."" The strategic placement of ""Harpies' Hunting Ground"" and ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"" will keep your opponent on edge, while ""Simorgh Onslaught"" and ""Dominus Impulse"" pave the way for overwhelming board presence. But the true brilliance lies in the seamless integration of the Simorghs. ""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"" and ""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"" ensure consistent resource gathering, while ""Simorgh, Bird of Perfection"" and ""Simorgh, Bird of Protection"" offer crucial disruption and resilience. When the time is right, unleash the might of ""Simorgh of Darkness"" and ""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"" to dominate the field. The Extra Deck is a flexible arsenal, ready to adapt to any challenge. ""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"" provides swift removal and further strengthens your Harpie strategy, while the Rank 4 toolbox offers versatile options like ""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"" and ""Lightning Chidori."" For those game-ending pushes, ""Accesscode Talker"" stands ready to deliver the final blow, guided by the strategic prowess of ""Harpie Conductor."" This isn't just a deck; it's an aerial assault, a masterclass in resource management, and a testament to the combined might of the Harpies and the Simorghs. Soar above the competition and leave your opponents in the dust &ndash; the storm is coming!</span></p>"

A symphony of synergistic destruction where the relentless milling power of Lightsworn collides head-on with the modular might of the ABC Union monsters and the disruptive force of Therions! This isn't just a deck; it's a high-octane thrill ride where Judgement Dragon's cataclysmic blast can clear the path for the combined arms assault of ABC-Dragon Buster and the strategic prowess of Therion ""King"" Regulus. Harness the speed of Galaxy Soldier and the graveyard manipulation of Starliege Seyfert to turbocharge your plays, while Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Infinite Impermanence stand guard against your opponent's schemes. Union Hangar and Union Activation ensure your ABC pieces are always within reach, ready to combine into their ultimate form. And when the situation calls for it, the Cyber Dragon package offers a technological edge, culminating in the fearsome Cyber Dragon Infinity. Dive into the chaos where Lightsworn's random destiny fuels a calculated engine of fusion and Xyz summons. Will you unleash the devastating XYZ-Hyper Dragon Cannon, the negation power of Invoked Mechaba, or the banishing brilliance of Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn? This deck demands a daring pilot, one who can navigate the delicate balance between self-milling and strategic deployment to seize victory from the jaws of chance!</span></p>"

This isn't just a deck; it's a whirlwind of mischievous Fiendsmiths and cryptic Fabled monsters, a symphony of discards and summons that will leave your opponent bewildered and buried under an avalanche of unexpected plays. We're not just playing cards; we're conducting a ritual of rapid-fire combos, fueled by the forbidden knowledge of Dark World Dealings and the explosive potential of Fiendsmith's Tract. Witness the arcane artistry of Lacrima the Crimson Tears, rising from the ashes of discarded dreams, while the enigmatic Fabled Raven whispers secrets that unlock devastating Extra Deck threats like the colossal Fiendsmith's Rextremende and the alluring Fiendsmith's Desirae. Brace yourself for the unpredictable power of Mulcharmy Fuwalos, threatening to erupt into a field-flooding nightmare, and the cunning disruption of Droll &amp; Lock Bird, slamming the brakes on your opponent's best-laid plans. This isn't a deck for the faint of heart. It demands a daring duelist, one who revels in risk and masters the art of controlled chaos. Can you harness the volatile fusion of Fiendsmith ingenuity and Fabled sorcery to unleash a torrent of relentless attacks and outwit your foes with mind-bending plays? Enter the Fabled Forge, where victory is forged in the fires of discard and the echoes of laughter!</span></p>"

This isn't just a deck; it's a high-octane narrative where the relentless march of the Centur-Ions collides with the shadowy intrigue of the Orcusts, all orchestrated by the regal command of Therion ""King"" Regulus. Weaving through the chaos are the forbidden whispers of World Legacy, ensuring every move is a calculated risk, a thrilling gamble on the edge of oblivion. Unleash devastating combos that pivot from the explosive power of Centur-Ion's Level Modulation to the dark recursion of the Orcust engine. Summon colossal Link monsters like the majestic Centur-Ion Legatia and the formidable Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star, each a harbinger of your opponent's impending doom. But beware, for this symphony is not without its dissonant chords. Navigate the treacherous allure of darkness and the unpredictable draw power of Pot of Desires, knowing that every card drawn could be the key to victory or the prelude to your downfall. Disrupt your opponent's strategies with the spectral grace of Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and the inescapable negation of Infinite Impermanence. This deck isn't just about playing cards; it's about crafting a thrilling saga of strategic brilliance and calculated aggression. Will you master the intricate dance between these powerful archetypes and ascend to victory, or will you become another forgotten note in the grand orchestra of duels?

Still is the most reliable fusion deck to climb Masterduel ladder with!,"<p>Does your opponent have several negates, interruptions, handtraps and they activated Maxx ""C"" during the Draw Phase? No problem! Albaz and friends are unstoppable! Three years of Branded in Masterduel hasn't slowed down this strategy at all!<br /><br />From my experience, Albaz and friends have been one of the most reliably powerful and usable decks I've used in the two years the strategy was legal in Masterduel. Branded Despia is also near its full power in Masterduel, making it an extremely powerful choice of strategy to tackle Masterduel ladder!</p><p>Saronir, Opening and Aluber are now all back to 3 when in the past, they were previously only at 1. Now all they have to do at Konami is make Branded Fusion 3 and Albaz will dominate in a format that is full of massive negate boards and Mulcharmy/Maxx ""C"" handtraps.</p><p>In my humble opinion, this makes Branded the current strongest fusion deck on ladder, able to go first making complex, multilayered interruptions. Going second, Branded has enough momentum, in-engine power and boardbreakers to plow through massive boards with multiple negates! Albaz and friends are up next as Yugioh's featured anime character (after Sky Striker Raye of course), and their banlist treatment of Branded Despia are definitely evidence of that! I'll be looking forward to the insane ""season 2"" support Albaz gets. In the meantime, let's fuse our way to the top of ladder!</p><p><a href=""/deck/fifth-anniversary-guide-to-branded-despia-january-2025-557371"" rel=""nofollow"">If you want a thorough guide on this deck, check out my earlier article by clicking here. </a></p><p><em><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Want to see the deck in action?

Zoroa can target a Magistus you control to equip it with a Magistus from Extra Deck, and if it becomes equipped with a Magistus Monster Card, you can Special Summon a Level 4 Spellcaster from hand or GY (other than another copy of itself) in Defense with its effects negated. Zoroa is not a bad card. In fact, it is one of the better Main Deck Magistus cards. However, in this Deck specifically, it is best to search him off of Spoon rather than hard drawing him. It&rsquo;s fine if we do hard draw him, but we just need to also draw a LIGHT monster to make up for the fact that we didn&rsquo;t have Spoon. Crowley would then make Mechaba using itself and the LIGHT monster we drew in our hand. Rilliona on Normal or Special Summon can either add a Magistus Spell/Trap from Deck to hand or return a banished Level 4 or lower Spellcaster to GY. You can also banish her from GY and target a Magistus you control to equip it with a Magistus from GY except for a Level 4 monster.

But her second effect can come up on a following turn if Spoon is not in GY. Her GY effect is basically a heavily watered down version of Spoon&rsquo;s GY effect. You can discard Spoon from hand to either search for a Magistus monster from Deck other than Spoon or you can halve the ATK of a face-up monster your opponent controls until the end of the turn. Also, you can banish Spoon from GY to target a face-up monster you control and equip it with a Magistus monster from Extra Deck or GY. Spoon is obviously a very good searcher, but let&rsquo;s talk about that GY effect. Unlike pretty much all the other Magistus cards other than Aiwass (I guess), Spoon can equip a Magistus monster from Extra Deck or GY to any monster you control, so any monster you control can make use of the Magistus monster&rsquo;s equip effects.

Aiwass in general is good for interruption, but boosting a monster by 1000/1000 when equipped is not that useful. Vahram is pretty specific in what it can be used to help out against. It&rsquo;s not like it makes the equipped monster unaffected by your opponent&rsquo;s Spell/Trap effects, and destroying a monster at the start of damage calculation is not too useful in a Deck with a lot of high ATK monsters. If anything, it works better when equipped to a monster that&rsquo;s equipped with multiple Magistus monsters to maximize its benefits. Ninaruru is pretty good, but I&rsquo;d rather side it in when I know that I am going second or if I really need Spell/Trap destruction since our Extra Deck has realistically 2-3 replaceable cards. Rilliona is also pretty good. Shame that she is not a Quick Effect, but that would be pushing it. Although she is still good as a way to deal with monster effects on a following turn or going second (sort of).

I'm playing only the bystials that I have , if you dont want any bystials play maybe something from the ""side tech"" that isnt that expensive. Part of the side deck are some upgrades or variant possibilities that u can use as inspiration . The hts and sales ban are for the chummies bcs they hurt a lot. Your own side deck should be oriented around your locals or the changing meta . The nadir package is one engine I suggest to invest in when u find 10 &euro; lying around,sub out the frightfur engine for it and add the 3rd high spirits and pls the sanctifire is straight out the gates of hell DO NOT play it . Side effects are a lot FTK locks and no more friends. But who am I to tell you. Ostinato stands for the melodious engine which is strong but need extradeck and main deck place( and I didn't test this yet).you could play the blue eyes link 1 for a dragon lock with sanctifire or playing a small branded engine in bewd.Dragoon is a possibility with the 1 dark magician or hex in the side.king of the swamp can be an extender if your fusions got negated , I'd recommend playing 2 polys if you play this. Btw no 1 priority should be getting super poly and the targets. then 1 extra granguniol and a minimum of 1 saronir + 1 branded lost and at last nadir package .</p><p>I hope this helps</p><p>Enjoy :)</p>"

Reason for jet is cuz I just really like the card and hate getting my true light destroyed. As for the neo kaiser, I like having it being sent from field to grave to dump maiden to grave if I know I can summon blue eyes just so I can get my true light out. It can also be an additional special summon if I got blue eyes on field (plus it can make the link 1 spirit).</p><p>For the extra deck, I used to play the crimson package with sifr, but when playing it on locals, I just never got to make it, so I scrapped it out and went for more of midrange package. Also was wanted to play ancient fairy life dragon and needed room anyways. It could potentially do an OTK.</p><p>For the side, I'm trying out dragon's mind instead of solemn judgement even tho solemn is practically better, but dragon's mind sounds really good on theory so I might take the risk to play it on sides. At the end of the day I'm not that competitive and still wanna have fun.</p>"

Rising Scale functions as an incredible extender summoning itself and another PUNK from deck, allowing these Cyberpunks to power through interruptions and handtraps. JAM FEVER! grants PUNK a unique monster negate as well, raising the power level of their endboards and insulating plays through handtraps like Nibiru.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Lacrima the Crimson Tears along with Agnumday also released with Wrath of the Tyrants, meaning Fiendsmith is now completely available to any strategy that can run it! Fiendsmith allows PUNK to play through handtraps especially Droll, since Fiendsmith cards summon from deck or send to the GY rather than adding them to the hand.&nbsp; If your PUNK deck was stopped by too much interruption, you can pivot to the Fiendsmith engine instead with any two bodies thanks to Moon of the Closed Heaven!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Combining the excellent new PUNK support with nearly full power Fiendsmith the PUNK duelist can end on a multilayered board with 8+ interruptions in the field, hand, GY and backrow!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

It is 60 cards since one Ze Amin is full PUNK combo thanks to Rising Scale, and there are 16 copies of Ze Amin (3 Ze Amin, 3 Ogre, 3 Foxy Tune, 3 Rising Scale, 3 Emergency Teleport and 1 Small World) giving the duelist a fair chance of drawing into it with their starting hand despite the 60 cards. 60 cards also make it less likely that you will hard draw your garnets (Sharakusai, Deer Note, Wa Gon, Jam Session, Lurrie, In Paradise, Lacrima, Birth) that are essential for the combos in your PUNK, Fiendsmith and Kashtira engines.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The two archetypes in this deck are of course&nbsp;PUNK (21 cards), Fiendsmith (8 cards) and Kashtira (5 cards).

The turn after, if your opponent hasn't surrendered yet, both <span style=""font-size: 16px;"">PUNK </span>and Fiendsmith have massive follow-up to enable an easy OTK. If your Fiendsmith cards are still in the GY and Field, they can recur and resummon themselves to generate a lot of attack while simultaneously picking apart your opponent's board! The PUNK cards have follow-up to, since Jam Session and Amazing Dragon is on the field and Dragon Drive is in the GY.
