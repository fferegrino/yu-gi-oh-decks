I, myself, was caught up in finding a deck that wants level 3 normal monsters as part of its engine, but Prima Materiactor changes all of that. Instead, you're left with a tight engine that stacks and adds whatever piece you need to keep your deck moving.&nbsp;<br /><br />In virtual world, the level 3 access keeps you in line with the deck's core game-plan while adding a very recursive draw engine with Exgard adding whatever pieces you need back to the hand. Small world is a must have in the deck as any card in the deck is a bridge to any other card in the deck.</p>"

World + Chaos Beast + Carbon,"<p>Greetings! Once upon a time, I made <a href=""/deck/bestower-of-countdown-534098"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>this deck</strong></a> thanks to Princess and win with Final Countdown. Now, I did it with Chaos Beast instead because what if Princess is banned? Let's find out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8Pc9OIlBQA"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Bring forth Tethys by replacing Capricious/Aces/Corobane and draw your whole deck...</p><ul><li>Whenever you draw a Fairy, reveal it to draw another card with Tethys. You can keep it going until you can't draw anymore.</li><li>If you hit non-Fairy, you stop movement. So, continue with Ixchel and alike to trigger Tethys again.</li><li>Always use ""Arcana Force XV"" in-hand to fetch what would be otherwise brick by Tethys, which is ""Light Barrier"".</li><li>Know that card draw has to be caused by an effect, not as cost, in order to draw a card with Tethys. For example, using ""Upstart Goblin"", seen in Side Deck, won't do any help for Tethys but ""Into the Void"" will. Remember this rule well.</li></ul><p>2) If Tethys + Aces are together, Link Summon Insulator with them. Otherwise, place Rain and Lebellman onto Pendulum Zones to Pendulum Summon 2 x Carbon + Capricious + Orange. Also, activate ""Final Countdown"" and ""Light Barrier"".</p><p>3) XYZ Summon Starring Knight with 2 x Carbon as materials. Then, use Knight to Special Summon The World and pick the outcome as <strong>heads</strong>&nbsp;thanks to ""Light Barrier"" to be able to skip your opponent's turn by sending two monsters you control to GY.</p><p>4) Synchro Summon Chaos Beast with Capricious + Orange. At that moment, Carbon asks you to shuffle itself on top of your Main Deck, which is essential to not deck-out for 20 turns forward.</p><p>5) End your turn and use The World to send Beast + Knight to GY, in order to be able to do what was explained in #3. When it's your move, bring forth Carbon + Beast for The World and repeat until you win with Final Countdown...</p><ul><li>With many LIGHT and DARK monsters available at your arsenal, reviving Beast won't be an issue, provided that you use Beast to retrieve banished monsters into your hand. Afterwards, Pendulum Summon them and use these as resources for The World.</li><li>No matter what you do, don't forget to send Carbon to GY for The World at all costs to not deck-out by accident.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Darklord Ixchel"" can be found either within ""The Opening Act of an Apocalypse"" or ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Trickstar Corobane"" can be found within ""Essence of Flora and Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Tokusano Shinkyojin"" can be found within ""Crystal Realm Defier"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Chicken Game"" can be found within ""The Most Dangerous Race of the Cosmos!"" Secret Pack to save 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Final Countdown"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""World Soul - Carbon"" can be found either within ""Hope Sprouting in the Spring Breeze"" or ""The Ones Who Serve Ra"" Secret Packs to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 360 SR and 240 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

I can't say if it's any better than pure Sky Striker (it probably isn't), but it DOES feel a whole lot better than pure Argostar, and I even managed to sneak in a godawful Full Armor package purely for the chance to do something more useful with the Argostar Rank 4. I'm surprised by how many hands this is actually able to start off of, and none of the Argostars ever stay in the Main zones for long enough to matter.<br /><br />If you're actually going to build this pile, please do yourself a favor and rip out the whole XYZ Full Armor package and replace it with Silhouhatte Rabbit or S:P or anything more generically useful.

This was simply too much for the main deck fiendsmith cards. Being able to turn the Ki-sikil link monsters makes the extra fiendsmith cards not as neccesary because of how easy it is to make requiem in hands that dont have any fiendsmith cards in them.</p><p>Next change i made was removing the Abominable Unchained Soul. there really wasnt a reason to include it in the deck, it almost never came up and there are better cards to search with Yama or the unchained spell, it also doesnt have the ability to make Caesar unlike the other good unchained cards.</p><p>With this newfound space in the deck I was able to slot in 3 imperms. Having ash blossom as the only handtrap was a major throw. The deck is able to play through interuption pretty well, but it definetly struggles against a fully formed end board that i wasnt able to stop because i didnt draw a handtrap.</p><p>A minor change I made was removing 1 Lil-la from the main deck for a Ki-sikil Frost. Normaling Frost can also act as a starter just like normal Ki-sikil (albeit a weaker one.) Also, having Frost in your hand when your normal summon Lil-la gets interrupted, or searching it with sunny snitch when you already opened a Live☆Twin. The utility of this card is definetly something i looked over when I was building the original deck.</p><p>The final change I made was taking a solemn out of the side deck for a copy of the big Evil★Twin main deck monster. At one point during testing I was struggling to find a way the deck could get over larger monsters. Something that worried me was my opponent making a giant unaffected tower that i had no out for. This was my best solution for that. I think that 4400ATK was plenty and you only need one copy of it because Trouble Sunny gives quick access to it paired with non-destroying non-targeting removal.</p><p>If I you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I check my decks often, so I will most likely respond.</p>"

The basic combo is Regenesis Archfiend -&gt; Regenesis -&gt; Regenesis Lord -&gt; Summons itself banishing Archfiend then sets Birth from deck. This interruption seems relatively little, but augmented by Fiendsmith, Kashtira and handtraps, it can be difficult for your opponent to face, especially since all three engines recur everyturn. This deck also has 12 handtraps/staple slots, making it easier to play 1st and second. You can also beat over monsters relatively easily, since most monsters in this deck are freely summoned and have 2000+ ATK.<br /><br />The Extra Deck are mostly cards for the Fiendsmith deck, and can be changed anytime to suit your playstyle. Honestly, this deck can do without the entire Fiendsmith package and can be played purely with Kashtira! The Extra Deck can be used as fodder for Pot of Extravagance or Super Polymerization in that deckbuild.<br /><br />Kashtira and Regenesis also has the funny distinction of having their ace cards named ""Birth"" so you can call this deck ""double birth control!""

This deck focuses on getting Dark Magician and its fusions out on the field using the Primite engine to boost that. You could easily trim some cards for more handtraps/links if you want it to be a little more competitive, but I wanted to keep the main focus on being able to actually play Dark Magician and its fusions instead of playing 10 link cards.

This isn't your average Labrynth build; we've twisted the opulent halls with the shadowy allure of Diabellstar and her Sinful Spoils. Lure your opponent into a web of disruptive traps and cunning hand traps, orchestrated by the elegant Lady and Lovely Labrynth. But beware, for this castle hides more than just welcome mats. Unleash the unexpected might of the Azamina family, morphing and evolving in the Extra Deck to deliver devastating blows and control the flow of battle. From the regal Moa Regina to the shadowy Mu Rcielago, their presence adds a unique and powerful dimension to the Labrynth strategy. Fool your foes with Metalfoes Fusion and the Sinful Spoils package, loading your Graveyard for explosive plays with Transaction Rollback and the ever-present threat of Eradicator Epidemic Virus.

Prepare for a Labrynth experience unlike any other &ndash; where beauty and brutality intertwine, and the unexpected reigns supreme.

This isn't your grandma's Harpie deck &ndash; it's a whirlwind of Simorgh synergy, soaring to new heights with the cunning of the Mist Valley and the relentless aggression of their winged allies. Weave through a storm of Harpie Ladies, each a vital piece in a symphony of destruction, while the enigmatic Simorghs manipulate the winds to summon colossal threats and disrupt your opponent's every move. From the explosive potential of ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" to the lockdown power of ""Harpie's Feather Storm,"" this deck commands the skies. Utilize the search power of ""Harpie Harpist"" and ""Harpie Perfumer"" to assemble your avian armada, then launch into devastating combos with ""Harpie Channeler"" and ""Elegant Egotist."" The strategic placement of ""Harpies' Hunting Ground"" and ""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"" will keep your opponent on edge, while ""Simorgh Onslaught"" and ""Dominus Impulse"" pave the way for overwhelming board presence. But the true brilliance lies in the seamless integration of the Simorghs. ""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"" and ""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"" ensure consistent resource gathering, while ""Simorgh, Bird of Perfection"" and ""Simorgh, Bird of Protection"" offer crucial disruption and resilience. When the time is right, unleash the might of ""Simorgh of Darkness"" and ""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"" to dominate the field. The Extra Deck is a flexible arsenal, ready to adapt to any challenge. ""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"" provides swift removal and further strengthens your Harpie strategy, while the Rank 4 toolbox offers versatile options like ""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"" and ""Lightning Chidori."" For those game-ending pushes, ""Accesscode Talker"" stands ready to deliver the final blow, guided by the strategic prowess of ""Harpie Conductor."" This isn't just a deck; it's an aerial assault, a masterclass in resource management, and a testament to the combined might of the Harpies and the Simorghs. Soar above the competition and leave your opponents in the dust &ndash; the storm is coming!</span></p>"

A symphony of synergistic destruction where the relentless milling power of Lightsworn collides head-on with the modular might of the ABC Union monsters and the disruptive force of Therions! This isn't just a deck; it's a high-octane thrill ride where Judgement Dragon's cataclysmic blast can clear the path for the combined arms assault of ABC-Dragon Buster and the strategic prowess of Therion ""King"" Regulus. Harness the speed of Galaxy Soldier and the graveyard manipulation of Starliege Seyfert to turbocharge your plays, while Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Infinite Impermanence stand guard against your opponent's schemes. Union Hangar and Union Activation ensure your ABC pieces are always within reach, ready to combine into their ultimate form. And when the situation calls for it, the Cyber Dragon package offers a technological edge, culminating in the fearsome Cyber Dragon Infinity. Dive into the chaos where Lightsworn's random destiny fuels a calculated engine of fusion and Xyz summons. Will you unleash the devastating XYZ-Hyper Dragon Cannon, the negation power of Invoked Mechaba, or the banishing brilliance of Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn? This deck demands a daring pilot, one who can navigate the delicate balance between self-milling and strategic deployment to seize victory from the jaws of chance!</span></p>"

This isn't just a deck; it's a whirlwind of mischievous Fiendsmiths and cryptic Fabled monsters, a symphony of discards and summons that will leave your opponent bewildered and buried under an avalanche of unexpected plays. We're not just playing cards; we're conducting a ritual of rapid-fire combos, fueled by the forbidden knowledge of Dark World Dealings and the explosive potential of Fiendsmith's Tract. Witness the arcane artistry of Lacrima the Crimson Tears, rising from the ashes of discarded dreams, while the enigmatic Fabled Raven whispers secrets that unlock devastating Extra Deck threats like the colossal Fiendsmith's Rextremende and the alluring Fiendsmith's Desirae. Brace yourself for the unpredictable power of Mulcharmy Fuwalos, threatening to erupt into a field-flooding nightmare, and the cunning disruption of Droll &amp; Lock Bird, slamming the brakes on your opponent's best-laid plans. This isn't a deck for the faint of heart. It demands a daring duelist, one who revels in risk and masters the art of controlled chaos. Can you harness the volatile fusion of Fiendsmith ingenuity and Fabled sorcery to unleash a torrent of relentless attacks and outwit your foes with mind-bending plays? Enter the Fabled Forge, where victory is forged in the fires of discard and the echoes of laughter!</span></p>"

This isn't just a deck; it's a high-octane narrative where the relentless march of the Centur-Ions collides with the shadowy intrigue of the Orcusts, all orchestrated by the regal command of Therion ""King"" Regulus. Weaving through the chaos are the forbidden whispers of World Legacy, ensuring every move is a calculated risk, a thrilling gamble on the edge of oblivion. Unleash devastating combos that pivot from the explosive power of Centur-Ion's Level Modulation to the dark recursion of the Orcust engine. Summon colossal Link monsters like the majestic Centur-Ion Legatia and the formidable Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star, each a harbinger of your opponent's impending doom. But beware, for this symphony is not without its dissonant chords. Navigate the treacherous allure of darkness and the unpredictable draw power of Pot of Desires, knowing that every card drawn could be the key to victory or the prelude to your downfall. Disrupt your opponent's strategies with the spectral grace of Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and the inescapable negation of Infinite Impermanence. This deck isn't just about playing cards; it's about crafting a thrilling saga of strategic brilliance and calculated aggression. Will you master the intricate dance between these powerful archetypes and ascend to victory, or will you become another forgotten note in the grand orchestra of duels?

Still is the most reliable fusion deck to climb Masterduel ladder with!,"<p>Does your opponent have several negates, interruptions, handtraps and they activated Maxx ""C"" during the Draw Phase? No problem! Albaz and friends are unstoppable! Three years of Branded in Masterduel hasn't slowed down this strategy at all!<br /><br />From my experience, Albaz and friends have been one of the most reliably powerful and usable decks I've used in the two years the strategy was legal in Masterduel. Branded Despia is also near its full power in Masterduel, making it an extremely powerful choice of strategy to tackle Masterduel ladder!</p><p>Saronir, Opening and Aluber are now all back to 3 when in the past, they were previously only at 1. Now all they have to do at Konami is make Branded Fusion 3 and Albaz will dominate in a format that is full of massive negate boards and Mulcharmy/Maxx ""C"" handtraps.</p><p>In my humble opinion, this makes Branded the current strongest fusion deck on ladder, able to go first making complex, multilayered interruptions. Going second, Branded has enough momentum, in-engine power and boardbreakers to plow through massive boards with multiple negates! Albaz and friends are up next as Yugioh's featured anime character (after Sky Striker Raye of course), and their banlist treatment of Branded Despia are definitely evidence of that! I'll be looking forward to the insane ""season 2"" support Albaz gets. In the meantime, let's fuse our way to the top of ladder!</p><p><a href=""/deck/fifth-anniversary-guide-to-branded-despia-january-2025-557371"" rel=""nofollow"">If you want a thorough guide on this deck, check out my earlier article by clicking here. </a></p><p><em><span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Want to see the deck in action?

Zoroa can target a Magistus you control to equip it with a Magistus from Extra Deck, and if it becomes equipped with a Magistus Monster Card, you can Special Summon a Level 4 Spellcaster from hand or GY (other than another copy of itself) in Defense with its effects negated. Zoroa is not a bad card. In fact, it is one of the better Main Deck Magistus cards. However, in this Deck specifically, it is best to search him off of Spoon rather than hard drawing him. It&rsquo;s fine if we do hard draw him, but we just need to also draw a LIGHT monster to make up for the fact that we didn&rsquo;t have Spoon. Crowley would then make Mechaba using itself and the LIGHT monster we drew in our hand. Rilliona on Normal or Special Summon can either add a Magistus Spell/Trap from Deck to hand or return a banished Level 4 or lower Spellcaster to GY. You can also banish her from GY and target a Magistus you control to equip it with a Magistus from GY except for a Level 4 monster.

But her second effect can come up on a following turn if Spoon is not in GY. Her GY effect is basically a heavily watered down version of Spoon&rsquo;s GY effect. You can discard Spoon from hand to either search for a Magistus monster from Deck other than Spoon or you can halve the ATK of a face-up monster your opponent controls until the end of the turn. Also, you can banish Spoon from GY to target a face-up monster you control and equip it with a Magistus monster from Extra Deck or GY. Spoon is obviously a very good searcher, but let&rsquo;s talk about that GY effect. Unlike pretty much all the other Magistus cards other than Aiwass (I guess), Spoon can equip a Magistus monster from Extra Deck or GY to any monster you control, so any monster you control can make use of the Magistus monster&rsquo;s equip effects.

Aiwass in general is good for interruption, but boosting a monster by 1000/1000 when equipped is not that useful. Vahram is pretty specific in what it can be used to help out against. It&rsquo;s not like it makes the equipped monster unaffected by your opponent&rsquo;s Spell/Trap effects, and destroying a monster at the start of damage calculation is not too useful in a Deck with a lot of high ATK monsters. If anything, it works better when equipped to a monster that&rsquo;s equipped with multiple Magistus monsters to maximize its benefits. Ninaruru is pretty good, but I&rsquo;d rather side it in when I know that I am going second or if I really need Spell/Trap destruction since our Extra Deck has realistically 2-3 replaceable cards. Rilliona is also pretty good. Shame that she is not a Quick Effect, but that would be pushing it. Although she is still good as a way to deal with monster effects on a following turn or going second (sort of).

I'm playing only the bystials that I have , if you dont want any bystials play maybe something from the ""side tech"" that isnt that expensive. Part of the side deck are some upgrades or variant possibilities that u can use as inspiration . The hts and sales ban are for the chummies bcs they hurt a lot. Your own side deck should be oriented around your locals or the changing meta . The nadir package is one engine I suggest to invest in when u find 10 &euro; lying around,sub out the frightfur engine for it and add the 3rd high spirits and pls the sanctifire is straight out the gates of hell DO NOT play it . Side effects are a lot FTK locks and no more friends. But who am I to tell you. Ostinato stands for the melodious engine which is strong but need extradeck and main deck place( and I didn't test this yet).you could play the blue eyes link 1 for a dragon lock with sanctifire or playing a small branded engine in bewd.Dragoon is a possibility with the 1 dark magician or hex in the side.king of the swamp can be an extender if your fusions got negated , I'd recommend playing 2 polys if you play this. Btw no 1 priority should be getting super poly and the targets. then 1 extra granguniol and a minimum of 1 saronir + 1 branded lost and at last nadir package .</p><p>I hope this helps</p><p>Enjoy :)</p>"

Reason for jet is cuz I just really like the card and hate getting my true light destroyed. As for the neo kaiser, I like having it being sent from field to grave to dump maiden to grave if I know I can summon blue eyes just so I can get my true light out. It can also be an additional special summon if I got blue eyes on field (plus it can make the link 1 spirit).</p><p>For the extra deck, I used to play the crimson package with sifr, but when playing it on locals, I just never got to make it, so I scrapped it out and went for more of midrange package. Also was wanted to play ancient fairy life dragon and needed room anyways. It could potentially do an OTK.</p><p>For the side, I'm trying out dragon's mind instead of solemn judgement even tho solemn is practically better, but dragon's mind sounds really good on theory so I might take the risk to play it on sides. At the end of the day I'm not that competitive and still wanna have fun.</p>"

Rising Scale functions as an incredible extender summoning itself and another PUNK from deck, allowing these Cyberpunks to power through interruptions and handtraps. JAM FEVER! grants PUNK a unique monster negate as well, raising the power level of their endboards and insulating plays through handtraps like Nibiru.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Lacrima the Crimson Tears along with Agnumday also released with Wrath of the Tyrants, meaning Fiendsmith is now completely available to any strategy that can run it! Fiendsmith allows PUNK to play through handtraps especially Droll, since Fiendsmith cards summon from deck or send to the GY rather than adding them to the hand.&nbsp; If your PUNK deck was stopped by too much interruption, you can pivot to the Fiendsmith engine instead with any two bodies thanks to Moon of the Closed Heaven!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Combining the excellent new PUNK support with nearly full power Fiendsmith the PUNK duelist can end on a multilayered board with 8+ interruptions in the field, hand, GY and backrow!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

It is 60 cards since one Ze Amin is full PUNK combo thanks to Rising Scale, and there are 16 copies of Ze Amin (3 Ze Amin, 3 Ogre, 3 Foxy Tune, 3 Rising Scale, 3 Emergency Teleport and 1 Small World) giving the duelist a fair chance of drawing into it with their starting hand despite the 60 cards. 60 cards also make it less likely that you will hard draw your garnets (Sharakusai, Deer Note, Wa Gon, Jam Session, Lurrie, In Paradise, Lacrima, Birth) that are essential for the combos in your PUNK, Fiendsmith and Kashtira engines.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The two archetypes in this deck are of course&nbsp;PUNK (21 cards), Fiendsmith (8 cards) and Kashtira (5 cards).

The turn after, if your opponent hasn't surrendered yet, both <span style=""font-size: 16px;"">PUNK </span>and Fiendsmith have massive follow-up to enable an easy OTK. If your Fiendsmith cards are still in the GY and Field, they can recur and resummon themselves to generate a lot of attack while simultaneously picking apart your opponent's board! The PUNK cards have follow-up to, since Jam Session and Amazing Dragon is on the field and Dragon Drive is in the GY.

This means that our opponent's monsters may stay on the field and be able to annoy us the next turn which is why we want to use&nbsp;<a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=46772449"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/46772449.jpg"" data-card=""46772449"" data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</span></a>&nbsp;to clear them.

The most worrysome set card is negation. We will simply just need to play through the negation.&nbsp;<br />By disregarding Spell/Trap Removal, we more increase our chance of having a hand that can deal with 3 monster boards - a tough ask by itself.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Other Considerations:</span></strong></p><p>Spell Speed Boardbreakers:&nbsp;<a class=""type-spell-card""

You still get some awkward hands.<br /><br />Some of my thoguhts on how I like to play the deck:<br /><br /><strong>Aspischool</strong></p><p>The art is derpy but it is realy cool as an starter for the deck, being able to unclog a hand that would be really hard to play with in the past: cases when psiics was stuck in your hand and there would be little way to get them into the field. The banish upon leaving the field on the additional summon can cut on resources but is a net positive when it just triggers a ghoti,make sure to load the GY first. <br /><br />When banished from GY to summon Psiics from banish, Aspischool can be chain link 2 in the new chain and now your Psiics can't be ashed.<br /><br /><strong>Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</strong><br /><br />You may get lucky and hit it with Dragite effect and then non target bounce, and if you add nibiru to the deck you will probably get a bounce or two after deck tining a little. In the GY, you can start recycling some of your synchro ghoti like Askaan that only banish on summon.</p><p><strong>Eria the Water Channeler</strong></p><p>Personally, I like this card though 'll admint you can play any other card and it would be fine, is a nearly universal searcher for the whole deck if the other monster is a lvl 2. You can get those pesky Ghoti lvl 6 into the graveyard and add a Tidal or the other Ghoti lvl 6.</p><p><strong>Lifeless Leaffish</strong></p><p>The old starter of the deck, you can probably run 3 and cut the charmer. In hand where both Aspischool and Leaffish are available, I'll say, normal the Aspischool and summon the Leaffish with the effect, you get both effects. Is at 2 since i really dont want to see more than one of these in hand. Remeber to recycle your spents synchro fishes!</p><p><strong>Tidal, Dragon Ruler of Waterfalls</strong></p><p>Use the effect in hand to send Mirror Mage to the GY and also load the GY. The summon effect can guarantee that we always have the Ghoti in rotation as you banish them to summon Tidal everyturn, Aspischool will trigger with this and you also get a free body.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Moray of Avarice</strong></p><p>With Aspischool it felt really good, before, you would need one Ghoti lvl 2 or a loaded GY if used on the big ones, with Aspischool, you get the 2 cards and the body back.</p><p><strong>Toxic Boxfish</strong></p><p>Can start the loop or restart it if your Psiics is stuck in the graveyard or disrupt your opponent in the turn with the summon and banish effect. It is not unrealistic to trigger both in the turn it is summoned and with Keaf, you can recicle the negate if need be.</p><p><strong>Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark</strong></p><p>I'm sure there a better rank 4 water that is not banned, but the intention is to crash and have White Aura whale come back after it has been dealt with, enfatically, White Reincarnation should be on the field so you get the Raigeki effect and double attack.<br /><br /><strong>Graydle Dragon<br /><br /></strong>A neat thing to summon with mirror mage to pop 4 (!) and if destroyed, we get to recyle maybe White Aura Whale once again.<br /><br /><strong>Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</strong></p><p>Just here to make something with Tidal that I never get to play, maybe just put Trishull, Navy Dragon Mech, Vermilion Dragon Mech or Crocodragon.<br /><br /><strong>Mermail King - Neptabyss</strong></p><p>Before Neptabyss the last link in the deck was the link 4 Marincess Bubble Reef, with Neptabyss we get target protection, wich was devastating in the past if one of our tuners gets imperm'ed.

For the same reason it wins while making half board very often.</p><p>These were the pros, now the cons.</p><p>The apophis package is very bricky going second (shocker, being on ten traps and an temple of the kings can make your hands unplayable, who knew).</p><p>It requires a lot of good decision making into mulcharmies-the lines are incredibly convoluted and at times asinine.</p><p>And lastly, it struggles against droll. You can eat most handtraps easily, but droll can make or break games often. Also, its on a low non-engine count, and while it has enough gas to play into boards very often, if your opponent is on mermail (where your bystials are useless) and you didnt draw non-engine, its game over.</p><p>Also, the side is very bad, please give me suggestions.</p><p>To summarize, incredibly fun deck to pilot that can stand against the meta!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

However, after some pretty quick deliberation, it is not good in Prediction Princess because we would have to be playing a large number of low Level Flip Monsters while also hard drawing Mocha in order to even Summon it by its effect. And then you would need enough Flip Monsters to open a good number of them in your hand to even use the effect of Behemoth Fiendess. The Decks that I feel could make the best use of Mocha are Krawler and a Subterror Deck playing a large number of Behemoths. Prediction Princess is not one of these Decks. But I did see that it is an Aqua monster, and it just so happens that a certain Level 9 Fusion Monster needs Aqua monsters as material: </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. So after some Deck-building attempts and testing, I still concluded that WAKE CUP! Mocha is just not playable in Prediction Princess, even Tearlaments Prediction Princess because of you having to hard draw it so often. But in the process, I was able to refine my previous Tearlaments Prediction Princess Deck quite a bit.

Reinoheart sends a Tearlaments monster from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon, and aside from being a named material on Kaleido-Heart, that is pretty much all that we are using him for. As for Scheiren and Merrli, we are just using them for their GY effect which is if they are sent to the GY by a card effect, you can Fusion Summon a monster by placing materials from your hand, field, and/or GY on the bottom of your Deck including itself. I&rsquo;m not excluding Havnis on purpose, but we do not need that many names in this Deck. Even 1 name could work, but we need to ensure that we can actually send one off of Reinoheart.

This effect really doesn&rsquo;t do anything unless you somehow make it turn 1 and keep it around to prevent your opponent from Imperming your Deus-X Krawler on their turn or something. But, it can also detach a material and target either a Level 9 in your GY or a monster in your opponent&rsquo;s GY and Special Summon that monster. Again, this can bring back a Kaleido-Heart to use its effect to spin a card on the field, but it can be also used to get something from your opponent&rsquo;s GY as well. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Borrelguard Dragon</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which is a LINK-4 that requires 3+ Effect Monsters as material and cannot be destroyed by card effects. We are mainly using it for its Quick Effect which targets a monster on field and changes it to face-up Defense Position whereas this effect&rsquo;s activation cannot be responded to by your opponent&rsquo;s cards or effects.You may not have seen me use or really talk about this card much, but it is good, specifically as a Link Summon off of I:P Masquerena on your opponent&rsquo;s turn (since that&rsquo;s when you will usually have enough material to do so) in order to have a way to flip up a Flip Monster that was Special Summoned by Tarotreith from Deck at the moment that you need to do so. In that case, as described in the combo above, you would chain Tarotreith&rsquo;s effect to flip any number of face-down monsters you control face-up to her Flip Effect that Special Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down. That ensures that Deus-X and Bibliomuse are face-up on field as soon as possible for protection and to negate the activation of your opponent&rsquo;s monster effects on their field. Borrelguard can then be Link Summoned via I:P using herself, Tarotreith, and probably either Tarotrei or Bibliomuse since they&rsquo;ve done their job in setting up your Flip Monsters, especially Deus-X.

Use Diamond to destroy Chicken at opposing side.</p><p>3) Activate 2 x Spell Absorption. These will let you gain LP and you can start blasting with Princess. To make it endless loop, play first Home Stadium and then play the other one. For each spell you have played in general, you will gain 2 x 500 = 1000 LP in total from 2 x Absorption, which is enough to gather first Home Stadium from GY/BZ by paying 1000 LP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" + ""Spellbook of Secrets"" + ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR + 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Trade-In"" can be collected by purchasing ""Origin of the Galaxy"" deck. 90 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Summoner Monk"" can be found within ""True Awakening of the Oathbound Knights"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Chicken Game"" can be found within ""The Most Dangerous Race of the Cosmos!""

If one archetype gets handtrapped (for example, when you summon Max), you can easily pivot to the other archetype (link away Max for Requiem) since both link-1s require only a light fiend monster! Handtraps are easily brushed aside in this strategy, with only the most powerful handtraps like Mulcharmy Fuwalos and Dimension Shifter able to fully stop the turn. Due to the sheer amount of link material, Magical Fiendsmith also can also tap into Unchained, giving you access to resource recursion and extra interruption through Unchained Soul of Yama and Unchained Soul of Rage.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If your opening hand has both Magical Musket and Fiendsmith, this deck ends on a whopping 5-6 layered interruptions!

Since it is the main strategy, the Fiendsmith cards are maxxed out for extra consistency. The Fiendsmith spells are also maxxed out since they have synergy with the Magical Musket monsters. It is composed of x3 Engraver, x3 Lacrima the Crimson Tears, x3 Tract, x3 Sanct, x1 Lurrie and x1 Paradise.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>MAGICAL MUSKETEER </strong>package in this deck is minimal, and it's used primarily as a way to generate extra link material, bait interruption, and to provide more fusion material for the summon of Fiendsmith Desirae.

Despite the low count of Magical Musket monsters, these cards are recyclable from the graveyard due to the Fiendsmith cards.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>UNCHAINED </strong>cards are a mini package in this deck that raises the power ceiling of the endboard. There are only two cards in the maindeck - x1 Sharvara and x1 Escape of the Unchained. Given you have enough link material, you can end on both Unchained Soul of Rage and Fiendsmith Desirae, complete with a set Escape of the Unchained and an Unchained Yama in the graveyard. If fully set up, these cards adds an extra 4 interruptions to your endboard (Rage's link away, S:P's double banish, and Escape's pop!)</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>STAPLES </strong>form nearly half of the cards in this strategy!

It allows for the best Yugioh to happen, where both duelists have a back-and-forth trading resources, cards and monsters on the battlefield. Fiendsmith Magical Musketeer allows for that! You can go either first or second, and actually play proper games vs. almost any deck this format can throw at you! Also, something is so unfathomably cool and unfair when you use a link-1 of 1 archetype to pivot into another link-1 monster of a second archetype! The unique identity of Fiendsmith Magical Musketeer as the premier ""link-1"" deck and the fun characteristics of its gameplay make this deck one of my favourites to ever pilot.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists!</div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You will probably lose a lot though.,"<p>This deck will probably be better played in a casual setting. Feel free to add or remove the cards you feel are useless. (Timaeus, Dark Magician, Dark Magic Mirror Force, etc.) I just get tired of seeing an archetype be played with only a select few of the cards within that archetype. That is mostly due to the state of ""Modern Yu-Gi-Oh."" If you aren't running staple cards or another archetype that makes the deck better (At this moment: Fiendsmith/Primite in Master Duel), then you are just going to lose. I'd rather lose while playing 70% of an archetype than win with only two cards from it.</p>"

Offers a rushed way to get some branded monsters on the field if all else fails. Really doesnt like going against decks that dont care about their extra deck and are mainly regular monster focused like dark magician decks, floowandereeze and Kashtira. Other than that tearlemants can just move from graveyard to field too easily to keep up with. Things to watch out for are really just cards that bansih instead of going to the graveyard(masked hero dark law, dimension shifter) as well as Destiny Hero Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer as his ATK lowering ability is not negated by Alba Zoa. Another Key note is that you kind of have to not brick to get off a succesful round 1 by milling or setting up a borad that cant be touched by the extra deck. That being said I've had alot of success going second as the different avanues can bait out abilities and reach a decent borad. If anybody has any tweaks or tips they are welcome. Obviously its not a top tier deck and can get countered somewhat easliy but I enjoy the cards and not being able to be affected by the extra deck is satisfying (especially if they dont read).&nbsp;</p><p>Accomplishments:</p><p>Diamond 1, multiple in game events can be cleared with tiny tweaking</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

If you are looking for an Atlantean deck to play without the degrenerate handrips and barrier statue lock then you came to the right list!&nbsp;</p><p>Your main goal is to get Coelacanth (Level 7 fish) out and summon 2 level 3's and 2 level 4's (Only works if Coel is the only monster in the main monster zone; you can have coral/Nept in the extra monster zone and be fine). Then, Xyz summon Virtue, search for ""Virtue stream"" activate Virtue's effect to add a Fish, Sea serpent, or aqua and search for either Toad package or more Atlantean extenders/ Harpooner if you have the materials for dragite. Then, overlay into Fortress, search for Reincarnation and full-armor trap (If you have either in hand try to get fortress to only 1 mat to detach so lancer combo is possible during your oppenents turn.) <strong>It should be noted that IF YOU CAN try to get ""Neptabyss The Royal Mermail"" on field before detaching for cost for either virtue or Fortress to activate his effect to search for Abyss-sting to then reborn an Atlantean or Mermail monster depending on what you need for your end board!</strong></p><p>or if you don't want to go into lancer package: Synchro Summon into Cora dragon, if you have Princess on field/ in hand with your normal summon you can; Normal summon princess, activate her effect as cost to send dragoon to GY, search for Deepsea minstrel or Shadow Squad (With dragoons mandatory search effect and depending on your situation and hand) and with Princess's effect add Poseidra to hand , then synchro in prima dona and try to get a level 3 tuner to go into chen or gymir depending on turn and board/ what your oppenent is playing.</p><p>Those are some baseline combo's you can do but I heavily recommend trying out different strategies. editting the deck to your playstyle, and experimenting with the many different lines this deck can follow depending on your opponents deck and whatever interruptions you encounter.</p><p>Also, if they were cheaper I would have added in some Mulcharmies or Impulse's.</p>"

The strangest thing about this deck is the complete lack of Jaden's signature fusion monsters. Even stranger is that many of the HERO fusion cards had been released by this point. I'm guessing that their idea was to just provide a base to add on to whatever HERO cards you may have collected at that point.</p><p>Using only cards that were included in the starter deck, I cut a handful of cards that are dead draws, and improved ratios for more important cards. All the HERO cards remained at 1x as they were included to maintain the spirit of the deck. I know Avian is useless in this deck - use him as discard fodder.</p><p><a class=""type-normal-monster"" href=""/card/?search=69140098"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/69140098.jpg"" data-card=""69140098"" data-name=""Gemini Elf"">Gemini Elf</span></a> &nbsp;was bumped up to 3x - it's a fantastic normal monster if you're reliving the early 2000s formats. <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=70046172"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/70046172.jpg"" data-card=""70046172"" data-name=""Rush Recklessly"">Rush Recklessly</span></a> and <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=97169186"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/97169186.jpg"" data-card=""97169186"" data-name=""Smashing Ground"">Smashing Ground</span></a> were both bumped up to 2x. Rush Recklessly is an underrated Quick-Play that can easily catch your opponent off guard once they think all your battle traps are taken care of. Trap Hole was bumped up to 2x as it's a no-brainer for easy removal. The rest of the trap ratios remained the same as I actually really like the lineup and it maintains the spirit of the character.</p><p>That's about all for today! Try it out against starter deck Syrus Truesdale. I'll tackle that one next.</p>"

It has space for a lot of non-engine, which is important to me, it has some good one card combos, although it's rather lacking in that capacity by modern standards, it has tools to beat Nibiru which is pretty popular at the moment, and it can play Herald of the Orange Light, one of the strongest hand traps and a good tool in a meta full of Mulcharmys and Maxx ""C"". The goal of the deck is to put up Etoile + Schuberta + Aria, giving your monsters targeting protection, battle protection, the ability to dodge effects, 3 GY banishes, and 3+ compulses. More advanced combos add Herald of Mirage Lights to beat Raigeki and Talent, and Bacha to make it harder to defeat the board with Forbidden Droplet.</p><p>For one card starters I'm on 3 Refrain, 3 Ostinato, and 3 1st Movement Solo. Ostinato is the best of these. Ostinato by itself represents a draw one, beats Nibiru, and puts up the standard end board of Etoile + Aria + Schuberta, all without using Bloom Harmonist, saving it for follow-up and making it harder to interact with. Ostinato + any name puts an extra Herald of Mirage Lights and recurs the fairy material to discard to it. Ostinato + 2 names can add I:P, a second Schuberta, or a Bacha to make your board even harder to negate. Refrain is a 1 card combo all by itself, but also factors into a lot of the 2 card combos that beat common hand traps such as Nibiru. 1st Movement Solo is another 1 card starter that features in 2 card combos that make Etoile under Nibiru and play through common hand traps. 1st Movement Solo is the most restrictive starter, since it xenolocks you into only Melodious monsters, but the free special summon is still incredibly strong. When I see both Ostinato and 1st Movement Solo I like to start with Ostinato, because the reward is higher if they don't Ash it, but the risk is low, since you're usually not missing out on much besides a spell negate if they do Ash Ostinato. It's notable that if you don't think they have Nibiru or Talent, it might be better to start with Solo, combo to the full end board, banish your own board, and then Ostinato to put up a second Schuberta or add a Bacha to the end board, but that play loses to Nib or Talent, so I wouldn't say it's generally worth it unless you're confident your opponent can't disrupt you. Refrain makes this possible by being a Stratos and Foolish Burial all in 1.</p><p>We're on all 3 Couplet, all 3 Sonata, and all 3 Soprano. The deck suffers from minor consistency issues, and since Prospy is banned we can't use it to make up the difference. All 3 of these feature in the deck's 2+ card combos, and Couplet and Soprano are important pieces of your 1 card combos as well. Couplet and Refrain have effects that allow you to scale them out of extra deck when you summon a fusion monster, so a common play is summon Refrain, search Couplet, Scale Couplet, search Concerto, fusion summon Bacha, scale your scales. Couplet also has an effect to summon a level 4 or lower when added to the hand outside of your normal draw in the draw phase. This allows you to play turn 0 off of Maxx ""C"" and Fuwalos, and also allows you to make use of Soprano and Shopina's add back to the hand effect to summon an extra monster from the graveyard, and also make Refrain search Couplet an even stronger start. Soprano's effect to add back to the hand is a HOPT, but it's effect which fusion summons using monsters on the field is a soft once-per-turn, meaning it can be used to fusion summon multiple times in sequence. Sonata is a free extender that comes up in some combo lines, and because it isn't a HOPT you can summon her multiple times in a turn sometimes. Sonata also enables access to Bloom Harmonist, which is an important back-up plan, given the decks minor consistency issues. I'm not on Canon, because I cut Bagooska. Honestly, D Barrier isn't particularly common right now, the Bagooska Ostinato board is both win-more and easier to break than the standard board, and also Bagooska is a little cringe (I don't like playing floodgates). I'm running a single Shopina, which is a taketomborg, almost a garnet, but allows you to add back light fairies in virtually any turn you don't Ash a Maxx ""C"", picking up Herald of the Orange Lights on occasion, and also being essential in your main combos. Aria is obvious to run, targeting and battle protection for your board is one of the big perks of the deck. Because Aria prevents targeting, you can't use Refrain's scale effect to dump a card if you summon it early, and summoning either Soprano or Refrain off of 1st Movement Solo is better into more hand traps anyways, so I wouldn't reccomend summoning Aria early in your combo in most circumstances, but technically an early Aria is good into hands with multiple Veilers and Imperms, so if Nibiru becomes less popular and Veiler more popular it would be better. Concerto is your final fusion spell, the only searchable one off of Couplet's scale effect, and it allows you to fusion summon using your hand, field, and pendulum scales, making it crucial in some of your combos.</p><p>For non-engine, I'm on a hand trap approach. Called By and Crossout are important vs Maxx ""C"" and Fuwalos and just generally good into Ash Blossom, which can cook the deck. These and Ash alongside Maxx ""C"" are the first non-engine I add to almost any deck, and they're pretty good here. I'm not on Nibiru or Bystials which are usually pretty standard rn, but are bad in the deck because of the restriction on Ostinato and 1st Movement Solo which requires you to control no monsters, and the restriction on Couplet that requires you to control only Melodious monsters, and they're also worse because of the Xenolocks in the deck. Ash is weaker here than normal, because while it works well into Maxx ""C"" style effects, if you Ash on your turn you can't use Shopina to recur anything, which isn't necessary to put up a board all the time, but is very commonly used 2-3 times per turn in your combos. Imperm is here, it's a board breaker and a hand trap, mostly because we're on Dominus Purge, but also because you can use it without conflicting with Shopina. Purge is similar to Ash, and in some ways is better, and because our entire engine is Light Fairies you don't lose anything but a couple of the less common extra deck monsters from using it from the hand, meaning you basically don't have to ever set it, making it a lot stronger in this deck than some. It does turn off I:P, S:P, and Ty-Phon, so it's not completely free, but those are less commonly made than, say, Schuberta, Etoile, Aria, maybe Bacha or Herald of Mirage Lights. Herald of Orange Lights is the final hand trap. It's costly to activate, but it can come up in some combos by virue of being a Light Fairy, it can negate Maxx ""C"" and other hand traps you protect your plays, it gives you access to monster negates that the deck is otherwise lacking, and activating it doesn't turn off Shopina, so I do think you must play 3 of this card.</p><p>My Extra Deck looks a little different than the standard, so I'll go through it in detail. I'm only on 2 Bacha. This is a little bit risky, as some games you'll want 3, either 2 turn 1 and 1 turn 3, or 1 on 1, 2 from Etoile, and then again on 3. However, lots of the combos recycle your 2 Bacha, and also you can make do with only 2 provided your play is clean. I'd rather not eat up space in the extra deck in case I screw up, not because I don't screw up, but because I need the space for generic monsters. Bacha's effect on summon summons a Melodious monster from the deck, and when sent to the GY it revives a monster, meaning it's a great tool for starting your combos, and it's almost always the first thing you make. I'm also on 1 Etoile, 2 Schuberta. These are your main interruptions. Schuberta is pretty good rn in a world of Fiendsmith and Blue-Eyes, and the fact that it also gains attack can close out games and allows you to banish during the Damage Step, making it very hard to interact with. You can reset Schuberta's ""once while on the field"" effect with Etoile, and also you can make multiple Schuberta for multiple GY banishes. Etoile is the deck's tool to play under Nibiru, and helps protect your monsters while also allowing you to return your opponent's cards to the hand. If it leaves the field it can summon Schuberta or Bacha from the extra deck as well, it's a very strong card. 1 Bloom Harmonist is a must run. Your best combos don't use this card at all, but it provides extra consistency, provided you're mindful of your zone placements, and it is also important when playing through disruptions. Lastly I'm on a single copy of Bloom Prima. This is mostly here for the Herald combo lines, as picking up a monster enables more powerful combo lines. However, it can also help OTK in some situations, which is not super relevent but is nice upside.</p><p>For more generic extra deck staples, we have Herald of Mirage Lights, which provides a spell negate in your best combos, Protector of the Agents - Moon to out floodgates, Gravity Controller to send a Bacha to the GY after you summon it to the EMZ, which enables you to play through imperm and Veiler in some situations, Haggard Lizardose to clear a Nibiru token and draw a card, enabling 1st Movement Solo and Ostinato, I:P and S:P, which are just good generic monsters to make when you see hands full of engine, Ty-Phon to help give you that final push, and Underworld Goddess, which is here to out Towers monsters such as light and dark Chaos Angel</p>"

Besides, you don't have to commit into 2 x Home Stadium loop via 2 x Spell Absorption a lot, which might take a while if your APM isn't enough.</li><li>Regarding Chain Summoning, combination of abilities of Synchro Monsters (Librarian/Merry/Cthugua) with Pharaoh can lead the way.</li></ul><p>2) When you have drawn your whole Main Deck, Tribute Summon Rage. Thanks to Telefons, you can be able to tribute them with Rage in order to activate the following abilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Opponent can't activate cards or effects in Spell and Trap Zones:</strong> While using Card Destruction, your opponent might find <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Infinite_Impermanence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong></a> and alike to shut you down. This ability from Rage secures you well in that regard.</li><li><strong>Opponent can't activate card effects in hand or GY:&nbsp;</strong>Ash, Nibiru and alike are gone. Such goes the way for Tearlaments or anything which favors from GY in hopes of disrupting your setup.</li></ul><p>3) Normal Summon Swordsman and activate Home Stadium in addition to 2 x Spell Absorption. Then, set ""Card Destruction"" and activate ""Contract with the Void"". With Endymion being discarded to GY, you can play ""Card Destruction"" and start milling your opponent.</p><p>4) In order to repeat ""Card Destruction"", you have to consume 6 x Spell Counters from Endymion's Lab (Magical Citadel of Endymion) to revive Endymion and fetch ""Card Destruction"" with him. To place more Spell Counters, you have to activate Home Stadium to gather second copy of it by paying 1000 LP. Whenever you play Home Stadium, you can repeat this loop without any issues since 2 x Spell Absorption will grant you 2 x 500 = 1000 LP in total anyhow.</p><p>5) Repeat what was explained in #4 until you win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Machine Duplication"" can be either found within ""Rescue Team, Emergency Dispatch!"" or ""Roid Nexus"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" can be either found within ""Life Force Control System"" or ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Ancient Leaf"" + ""Dimension Dice"" + ""Dice Dungeon"" + ""Zero King Rage"" + ""Card Destruction"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 300 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Relinquished Anima"" can be found within ""Toontastic"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"" can be found within ""Rapid Aircraft Advancement"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ib the World Chalice Justiciar"" can be found within ""Star-Studded Futures"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Endymion, the Master Magician"" + ""Endymion's Lab"" can be found within ""Knowledge of the Mythlords"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Argostars - Home Stadium"" can be found within ""Wrath of the Tyrants"" Timed Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 750 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

One is randomly put face down to your opponents field.</p><p>If you got archfiend in hand, summon it using the effect of maker and activate archfiends effect to flip up the face down slime, allowing you to special summon a mimighoul from deck. The best approach here would be to summon Mimighoul Maker and search fairy, then xyz into Giant mimighoul and search dungeon, adding any mimighoul, before either special summoning fairy from hand and link summoning using Giant and fairy, or just leaving the Maker and Giant on the board.</p><p>If you got slime in hand, special summon it through makers effect and then xyz summon Giant Mimighoul and fetch a Mimighoul Dungeon from deck and activate it, then use its effect to search any mimighoul, except Master. From there, set the mimighoul top your opponents field face down and pass turn. Because of Mimighoul dungeons effect, they must flip up your monster or they cannot normal summon, where you will benefit. If the choose not to do this and instead special summon immediately, you can banish Maker from grave on summon to flip up the monster anyway.</p><p>The reason i run summoning curse and reverse reuse is that, in summoning curses case, every time you summon a mimighoul to their field, your opponent must banish a card from their hand as they control that monster. In reverse reuse's case, i use it as basically 2 more mimighoul room's, as it allows you to set flip monsters from your grave to your opponents field, allowing you to lock your opponent out of normal summoning while reusing link materials to put on your opponents field.</p><p>Kashtira also works very well in this deck as the mimighouls activating on your opponents field allows you to banish a card from the ED, same with Talents effects.</p>"

Different dynorphins show different receptor selectivities and potencies at receptors. Big dynorphin and dynorphin A have the same selectivity for human KOR, but dynorphin A is more selective for KOR over MOR and DOR than is big dynorphin.

This isn't just an Agent deck; it's a harmonious fusion, where the sacred Agents of creation and destruction dance alongside the enchanting Melodious divas. Prepare for an orchestra of unexpected combos! Witness the relentless swarming of Mystical Shine Balls leading to powerful Synchro and Xyz plays, while The Agent of Creation - Venus fuels your heavenly ascent. But don't be fooled by the angelic facade; Archlord Kristya and Master Hyperion stand ready to lock down your opponent and unleash devastating attacks. The Melodious monsters, with their unique protection and recovery effects, add a layer of resilience and surprise, allowing you to recover and rebuild even in the direst of duels. With cards like Ostinato and Melodious Concerto, you can swiftly bring out your divas and set the stage for a grand performance. This deck thrives on synergy, using Eva to search out critical hand traps like Herald of Orange Light and Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, ensuring your opponent's strategies are constantly disrupted. And when the time is right, unleash the full might of your Extra Deck, from the disruptive power of Chaos Angel and Masterflare Hyperion to the game-ending potential of Flowering Etoile the Melodious Magnificat. Celestial Serenade is more than a deck; it's an experience. It's for the duelist who appreciates intricate plays, unexpected comebacks, and the satisfaction of dominating the field with a divine chorus of monsters. Are you ready to conduct your opponents into oblivion?</span></p>"

Prepare to witness a spectacle of blinding light and shadowy trickery, a symphony of self-milling madness that culminates in explosive power! This isn't your grandma's Lightsworn deck (unless your grandma is really hardcore). Behold! The ""Chaos &amp; Lightshow Extravaganza!"" Ever wanted to play a deck that operates at the speed of light (and sometimes crashes just as spectacularly)? Do you enjoy the thrill of sending half your deck to the graveyard in a single turn, teetering on the brink of glorious victory or hilarious defeat? Then step right up! This magnificent monstrosity blends the chaotic energy of the Chaos monsters with the relentless milling power of the Lightsworn. Watch in awe as Judgment Dragon descends like a divine meteor, banishing your opponent's hopes and dreams to the shadow realm! Marvel at the unpredictable plays enabled by the ever-shifting graveyard, where banished monsters become fuel for the mighty Chaos Angel and the enigmatic The Chaos Creator. But wait, there's more! Our Lightsworn contingent, led by the ever-reliable Raiden and the spell-slinging Lumina, ensures a constant stream of graveyard fodder, paving the way for devastating Synchro Summons like the majestic Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and the chilling Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. And when things get really wild, the multiple incarnations of Minerva &ndash; from the curious Maiden to the exalted goddess &ndash; will spin your deck into a whirlwind of potential! Of course, no self-respecting chaotic light show would be complete without a few unexpected twists. Prepare for the disruptive antics of Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Droll &amp; Lock Bird, ready to rain on your opponent's parade. And when you need that extra push, Pot of Desires and Trade-In offer a gamble for even greater rewards (or just more cards to send to the abyss &ndash; it's all part of the fun!). This deck isn't for the faint of heart. It's a high-risk, high-reward rollercoaster that demands a pilot with nerves of steel and a healthy appreciation for the absurd. So, are you ready to embrace the chaos? Are you prepared to unleash the ultimate Chaos &amp; Lightshow Extravaganza upon your unsuspecting opponents? Then shuffle up, draw your opening hand, and let the games begin! Just try not to mill your entire Extra Deck... unless you're feeling really spicy.</span></p>"

To craft this deck it took me a lot of time and many different approaches but here it is. It's basically a combo deck with many winning conditions like ""Beat-down with Gadgiltron"", ""Spanking opponent with Yubel + Savage Colosseum"" or just ""Floodgating the opponent with Yubel - Terror Incarnate and kiting with Drill Warrior"". Level Eater can be a free summon in every turn by decreasing Yubel's levels, to synchro summon Drill Warrior with Quickdraw Synchron. Some of the combos can be pretty complicated and most of the Extra deck is not accessible. Read, play, learn, repeat ! That's my only advice.</p><p>Alternative option: -3 Quickdraw Synchron, -3 Battle Fader, -1 Mystic Tomato for +3 Debris Dragon, +2 Lonefire Blossom, +2 Dandylion (and a bunch of level 6,7,8 Dragon Synchro monsters)</p>"

I used other Edison format zombie decks as ref in making this and added cards that I liked using back in the day. So if you are looking for absolute optimization then I'd look elsewhere.&nbsp;<br /><br />The main point of this deck is to pull out zombies to enter into your extra deck monsters quickly, as well as pulling and dragging control of your opponent's monsters. Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon was part of the main reason I wanted to make my own version, since it was one of my favorite cards growing up. It has good utility in this deck if Zombie world is on the field as it can pull any monster destroyed by it onto your side of the field without having to give it back. While Zombie World is a pretty vulnerable card overall given it only takes a MST to wipe out, we can use a few cards to cycle it back into our possession, like the Immortal Ruler to add it back into are hand if in the grave, or the Soul Release / Necroface combo to Banish it and then add it back into our deck (Soul Release can also be used on Immortal Ruler as well to loop the prior combo if really needed). This also helps if your opponent removes your zombie world from play before this, as then Necroface can add it back in alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />Again I want to point out that this is not optiman, and usually if you're going against an optimized deck duels aren't going to last quite long enough to pull this off consistently. However, if you're just having fun with friends this should be a fine combo.&nbsp;<br /><br />The side deck is made for either adding a bit more flavor to the already existing engine (Yes we all see you Genesis, beloved). However, most of it is to add some more consistency if Zombie World isn't working out.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't call this an outstanding deck, but at the very least it scratches an itch I've had for a bit and should be fun to use. So figured I'd share just in case anyone else was looking for something like it. If so, I hope you enjoy it!!</p>"

Here is a list that I think is very competitive, we have the Dimensional Fissure, which kills almost 100% of the meta. We have a lot of draw, since the deck has cards that do nothing alone, so always good to have variety of cards in hand and lastly the Fiendish Chain, which has the idea of holding the worst counter of this deck, Ryko and Lyla. The side deck I left very generic, I'm still working on it</p>"

The main idea of the deck is to use Magical Hats, bring a Geartown and a Gateway. In this, you give Compulsory in the Gateway and ready, you add the best card from the deck by hand and at the end of the opponent's battle you bring an Ancient Gear to the field. But you can not always get this move, because it is not always with the compulsory, in this case we can bring 2 Geartown or a Geartown and a Divine Sword. The idea behind the Divine Sword is to control the cemetery so we can play quieter Eatos in the middle for the end of the game, since the problem of Eatos is just the end of the game when you have many monsters in the cemetery. And to control a little bit more the cemetery put a Bazzo to remove the Eatos or a Gear Actor, has options like Soul Release in this function or Dimensional Fissure, but the good of Bazzo that is a body in the field with a cool atk.</p>"
