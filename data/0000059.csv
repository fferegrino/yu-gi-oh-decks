It's also important to remember that you should think twice before summoning a monster. Don't start on a damage basis (except if you can knock your opponent life points to 0), but more on a summon focus basis. Overall, except level 5/6 monsters, Constellar monsters are not strong when alone on the field. Xyz as fast as possible.  &nbsp;  As you noticed, Constellar monsters are a little weak. You want to boost them with card as <a data-name=""Lumenize"">Lumenize</a> or <a data-name=""Luminous Spark"">Luminous Spark</a>. You can even use <a data-name=""Constellar Acubens"">Constellar Acubens</a>, but be careful, it's kinda risky.  To defend, there are many cards. Some relies on the Xyz, others don't. <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a> directly comes to mind, BUT, you can also use <a data-name=""Fairy Meteor Crush"">Fairy Meteor Crush</a> ! Just equip it to an opponent's monster and place a face down monster with low defense. Your opponent will be the one taking damage !  &nbsp; <p>To fully master this deck, even if it's outdated, you must play it. That's just a basic guide of how to use the deck, there are many playstyles that only you can define. It's not a Link Format Deck, but it's fun !</p>  <h1> <strong>IT'S TIME TO DUEL !!</strong></h1>"

But here, this is not another orcust version, it's not because mine is better, it's because i want to show other viable option with cyber dragon.  I will not speak about all combo in this deck, but I will give you some tricks. And I will explain why i play this or that card.  &lt;!--more--&gt; <h2>About the deck</h2> First of all let me talk about <a data-name=""Number 67 Pair-a-Dice Smasher"">Number 67 Pair-a-Dice Smasher</a>. This card is an ""hight risk great reward"" monster. Indeed its first effect are very similar to <a data-name=""azathot"">azathot</a>. You and your opponent will roll two dices and the bigger one will cannot activate monster effect and attack. To help you to win this roll, you can activate its second effect. This effect will change one roll of your opponent to 7. You can notice that if you do the same result than your opponent the effect of the number 67 will not be applied. What's more, the player who takes the negative effect cannot activate monster effect in the field of course, but in the graveyard and his hand too. For your information I made some math to calculate if this card is really worth or not. If you consider that if you roll the same result than your opponent is also a bad situation like if you lose the roll. You have around 17.443% of chance to be in a bad situation. Most of the time if you lose the roll you will lose the game, it's a fact, but with <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> you can maybe survive and come back. If you win the roll you can be sure that you will see your opponent tears appear (except sky striker deck).  After that let me explain why i play <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Sol Flare Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Sol Flare Dragon</a>. There is one main reason, to remove Number 67 after blocking the opponent and to add a <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> from the grave to your hand.  You can notice in my side deck that i play <a data-name=""Electromagnetic Turtle"">Electromagnetic Turtle</a>. This card can save your life against strong OTK deck like Crusadia or other deck very OTK oriented. You can send Electromagnetic Turtle from the deck to the grave with <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> second effect, or you can use it for the <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> summon  So that's all i can tell about this deck, for the other card is more usual  If you have some question or comment about this deck, don't hesitate to tell me.  Thanks for your reading  &nbsp;"

With the newly arrival of Evil Heroes in TCG, Heroes deck gains options for going second games by considerably increasing the fire power of the deck to OTK more reliably and has now a great beatstick with a good protection effect.  So the Evil Hero engine is quite reduced in a mixed Heroes deck, but can consistantly come out due to the presence of searchers like Elemental Hero Stratos, Elemental Hero Shadow Mist or E-Emergency Call. The main goal is to search Evil Hero Adusted Gold to discard itself and tuto a Dark Calling. Dark Calling banish from the graveyard to summon Evil Hero Malicious Bane that is a fairly good option over Vision Hero Trinity most of the time due to its easier summon conditions and almost free summon while Trinity needed 3 monsters and basically reduced the ressources for a comeback (it still can be used to bypass the most powerfull beatsticks). Malicious Bane is protected from destruction and sports a Raigeki-like effect for monsters with attack less than it's own, knowing that it can boost itself by destroying other monsters and can hit 4000 Atk with the support of Xtra Hero Dread Decimator, consisting on numerous OTKs when it hits the ground.  Besides that, the other engines remains the same, we Simply cut Destiny Draw for Twin Twisters to struggle against the omnipresent backrow decks to manage OTKs more easilly.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is very similar, we just replaced Masked Hero Dian by Maskeed Hero Divine Wind to geerate misstimings on Stratos tuto effect and have more defensive options thanks to the support of Elemental Hero Honest Neos that can lock an entire battle phase to perform an OTK the next turn.  Destiny Hero Dominance isn't needed anymore so we can play Destiny Hero Dangerous to notably have another Fusion Destiny target and generate advantage by triggering Shadow Mist from the deck in case of insufficient starting hand.  Finally one Borrelsword Dragon complete the new extra deck and add an evasive angle to OTK in some specific game configurations or Simply ensure a game in case of a comeback when Malicious Bane is already defeated.  &nbsp;  The extra deck  To perform against the increasing backrow techs and control decks, we also add a third Twin Twisters and a set of Mystical Space Typhoon that présents the advantage of being free of costs.  A little artifact package will be a great threat for most of aggro and combo decks when going first by locking the extra decks invocations and allowing a solid OTK next turn.  The Winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere Mode is specially designed for going first combo decks like Guardragons that could prevent us to play Yu-Gi-Oh! and will allow us to set up a solid board for OTK  Lastly Imperial Order and the Anti-Spell Fragrance are designed for the still powerfull SkyStriker decks and Pendulums that could be threats due to their abilities of respectively control turns and win by card advantage or disrupt key spells and monster effects of the loops."

I can now really see why the bans made to the deck are pretty necessary. I'm pretty set on the number of each of my cards, but vector blast could go to two for sure. Great for setting up your graveyard if your opening hand isn't great. Also is great as a way to get rid of untargetable extra deck monsters like Avramax. I usually search engage off of Shizuku just to get another card in the grave first before activating the card I searched with Engage. I hope you enjoy please leave comments about your numbers :)"

Hero's are the only reason I play Yugioh. I loved them as a kid, and I love them more now that they are even better. It's especially cool that now each hero archetype is used in the main deck. This deck contains a slightly odd arrangement of monsters, but it has worked very well for me. Almost every one of your main deck monsters are useful, except for most of the destiny hero's which are just used for fusion destiny targets. Make two monsters, make cross guy, respawn malicious hopefully, pop malicious to search Adusted gold, ditch gold, special malicious bane is the easiest combo ever. You can stop there but usually, you can still take it even further. We truly are living in a golden age of heros where every other month we get great hero support. Enjoy and please leave your comments below :)  I've made a few changes to the deck in the past two months. Primarily I took the random cards out of the extra like the knightmares. Half the time if you make them you are putting yourself at a huge deficit so I found some other heros to replace them. The other being the rebalancing of the main deck. This seems like the standard number set now for the main engine of heros primarily: Stratos @3, Faris @3, Vyon/Increase/Shadowmist @2, Solid @1, and then the others. I changed up the destiny heros a bit. I dropped dynatag and put in disk commander. Very nice for if you have to go first make dystopia or dominance then on your second turn use cross to grab him back and draw two. I like this over the extra push for damage from dynatag, and the ability to pop one card doesn't always come up. Speaking of Dominance. I took dangerous out the extra and put him in the side. Being able to determine what your opponent is playing if you go first is huge because it will tell you what type of board to finish on. Also taking away the top deck for actual garbage is so huge.  I also added bubbleman for the easiest board wipe of all time. Add bubbleman and poly somehow and you have an insane board with a mask change hopefully set and a dark monster. You can flex into either dark law or acid depending on the type of deck you are playing against. Anki really isn't necessary for the same reason that dynatag isn't necessary. You should have game most of the time and an extra 2800 is just the cherry on top."

Use There Can Only Be One to lock your opponent's play and keep their monster count very low so you can stomp over them. Using battle ocean and misstar boy your Marbled Rock should reach 5,000Attack which is enough to run over anything. Make use of field barrier to prevent your field spell from losing to MST or Twin Twisters though do keep in mind you are vulnerable if they use cosmic cyclone. If your opponent manages to make a threatening monster that can attack over Marbled Rock (Avramax, or Borrelsword) then use Marbled Rock's effect to pitch a Marincess and negate the attack until you get Paleo Dino, then use it to banish the threat."

So instead of old aggro builds and their mixed versions with archétypes like Train, I'll show you a more defensive build that can be Deadly for most decks.  The main idea is to abuse draw power with Darklord Ixchel, the Danger! package and the few draw spells to search cards easilly and spam the board to summon great disruptive monsters and set powerfull traps in the graveyard/on the board to fully lock the opponent and win by OTK or 2 turns kill. Of course the build allows OTK strategy for going second games thanks to it's spam potential.  &nbsp;  So the deck won't run all Darklord, to gain slots for the Danger! engine. Darklord Ixchel is a fantastic draw effect that cycles the hand and discard key cards like Darklord backrow and Darklord Superbia to gain access to more extenders and control cards. Nasten is a way to set the graveyard too and share the effect of triggering Darklord backrow from the graveyard with Ixchel to have more control during the opponent's turn and use them 2 times in a same turn. Superbia is an amazing discard target that will summon anoter Darklord when summoned from the graveyard and allow a double tuto and another resurrect effct by bringing back Ixchel/Nasten. Zerato is at only 1 because it can't help the loop but works as a Raigeki for OTKs when going second.  The Danger! package spam the board and consists on a great way to draw numerous cards  to assemble threatening boards. They can also discard targets for Ixchel and Nasten's second effect and Superbia. The highest Danger! are also targets for Virus cards and draw spells, that' why we play 2 Bigfoot and 2 Thunderbird in addition of the classic package.  Krystia is the last piece of the loops and locks all special summons to make sure the opponent won't come back from our board. In this deck it's specially powerfull since i'ts pretty easy to have 4 fairy monsters to special summon it from the hand and recycle key monsters like Ixchel for a potential next turn. It's also level 8 so targetable by the draw spells in case of going second games.  &nbsp;  The spell and trap package allows draw power and great control for opponent's ressources. First the Darklord package brings Darklord Contact and Banishment Of The Darklords that can special summon from the graveyard (specially Superbia to litterally have a double special summon) and tuto any Darklord card to easily assemble combos. We have 1 exemplary of The Sanctified Darklord, Darklord Rebellion and Darklord Enchantment that can be used as discarding cost to be sent into the graveyard and disrupt the opponent by negating monster effects with an Added recovery, steal monsters and destroy cards. These traps are powerfull since they can easily shut down decks in combination with cards like Kristya and don't target the opponent's cards, meaning they can bypass threats with protection effects. All these cards can be triggered two times in a turn thanks to Nasten and Ixchel shared effect.  The virus package suppress monsters with 1500 or less Atk or Def regarding the type of the Virus, and can suppress all spells or trap too. In combination with the other lock/disruption cards they can completely stop any deck following the match up. Here they have a supplementary point since they can consume one of the level 8 Danger! to trigger their effect.  Lastly Trade-In and Advance Draw are good draw 2 cards that add stability and can easily trigger due to the fair number of level 8 and more monsters of the deck.  &nbsp;  The extra deck adds control cards and is designed for aggressive plays plays when going second. First Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess is pretty easy to summon and is a multiple negate for monster effects, and Number 38 is an alternative way to pressure spells and prevent a comeback following the starting hands.  The knightmare package can suppress some annoying cards for an OTK and give access to Borreload Dragon and Borrelsword Dragon to perform OTKs/Bypass the most resilient monsters. Link spider can be used with the tokens summoned by Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossac to instantly get to a Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax.  The little galaxy-eyes engine can destruct 2 cards in a row and give a beatstick to ensure OTKs. The little Cannon package give OTKs in case of restrained boards due to eventual opponent's disruption with a good burning effect and a multi attacking huge beatstick.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now the side deck  Since the deck use to be a threat for almost all decks when going first, we exclusively play cards to soften going second match ups besides Imperial Order that completely shut down decks like Pendulum and Skystrikers, another Full Force Virus that ensure to break beatdown strategies and a classical artifact package that notably makes Orcust useless in combination with Kristya.  Twin Twisters is an excellent removal that will alawys find good targets to discard and enable Otks over cards like Monarch Erupt and There Can Be Only One  To bypass combo decks with almost unbreakable boards, The Winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere Mode will be a deadly weapon that suppress 3 monsters and allows greay OTKs."

More Like Marine Incest ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),"<h1>One Card Strategy</h1> ""How many cards You want to use?""  ""Yes...""  Marincess is like Salamangreat, it's able to be used efficiently. With only 1 card, You can have a Link 3, Field Spell, and still have 5 cards in Hand (if You're going first). How this work? You need to have Marincess Sea Horse in Your Hand. Normal Summon Marincess Sea Horse, use it to Link Summon Marincess Blue Slug, and use its effect to return Marincess Sea Horse to Your Hand. Special Summon Marincess Sea Horse by its own effect, use it to Link Summon Marincess Sea Angel, use its effect to add Marincess Battle Ocean to Your Hand, and activate it. ""We're not done yet - Ai"" Use Marincess Blue Slug and Marincess Sea Angel to Link Summon Marincess Coral Anemone, use its effect to Special Summon any Monsters from Your Graveyard, and use Them to Link Summon Marincess Marbled Rock. Finally, use Marincess Marbled Rock's effect to return Marincess Sea Horse to Your Hand.  &nbsp; <h1>Two Cards Strategy</h1> For the Two Cards Strategy, You need to have Marincess Pascalus and any Marincess Monster other than Marincess Pascalus. Normal Summon Marincess Pascalus and use its skill to Special Summon any Marincess Monster other than Marincess Pascalus. Just like before, use Them to Link Summon Marincess Blue Slug and Marincess Sea Horse, and use Them to Link Summon Marincess Coral Anemone. Activates Marincess Coral Anemone's skill to Special Summon any Marincess Monster from Your Graveyard, and use Them to Link Summon Marincess Marbled Rock. Before You say anything like ""Then what's the differences?"", I'll explain it to You. So this Strategy's result will depend on what other Marincess Monster You have and use with Marincess Pascalus' effect. If it's Marincess Blue Tang for example, then You can have at least 6 cards in Your Hand (if You're going first). You can also have Marincess Coral Anemone and Marincess Crystal Heart on Your Field, and use it to Link Summon Marincess Wonder Heart. Yeah, it's basically at least 4,400 Attack, unaffected by Your Opponent's card effects, can't be destroyed by Battle, You won't take Battle Damage, and You can Special Summon one of Your equipped Marincess Monster to attack and even use its effect.  &nbsp; <h1>Offense - Defense</h1> Actually, both Marincess Marbled Rock and Marincess Wonder Heart can be used for Offense. However, Marincess Wonder Heart is the best Offense in Marincess Deck. Marincess Marbled Rock's roles are Hand / Extra Deck Recovery, Defense, and a little Offense. Marincess Wonder Heart is good for Defense in Marincess Deck, because You only need to use Marincess Monsters You control that's equipped to Marincess Wonder Heart."

So now I'm going to share the build I have been testing for you guys. Also I want to mention that this deck, in my opinion, is so much fun to play because its both competitive and its just fun to break your opponents boards and then just control the game from there. With this deck you always want to go second and break your opponent's board. Since that is the goal, I main 3 <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. These 2 cards were actually insane in testing and is a complete blowout to your opponent, making  them scoop if they resolve. Mind Control baits out negates allowing you to do more plays. One of the main win conditions of the deck is the <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a> Utopia combo where you overlay 2 level 4s for <a data-name=""Utopia Double"">Utopia Double</a> and use it's effect to get Double or Nothing! and OTK your opponent. Once you bait all their negates and use Utopia Double they have nothing left to respond with and just get OTKd. Drawing double or nothing can be annoying when it happens, but at that point you just control them and stop them from making any further plays after breaking their board and then kill them the next turn. You could also theoretically set double or nothing and use <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>'s effect to shuffle it back into the deck. A lot of people who play this deck only play 1 Dancing Needle but in this format it is needed because almost all of the meta decks out currently need their graveyard to win, orcust, sky striker, salamangreat. Orcust is huge at the moment and when Dancing Needle resolves, Orcust players get destroyed. Another tech choice is running <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Wild"">Magical Musketeer Wild</a>. I know nobody plays Wild but my reasoning is that it is another level 4 target in case you banish Calamity off Desires and also it has come up where you can be grinding for so long that you run out of Musket targets in your deck and Wild fixes that problem, especially with Desires. I'm sure some of you are wondering what to do when you think they are going to make you go first and my solution to that is simple, just side in 3 Nibiru, 3 Super Poly, and 3 <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and when you start just summon a Musket and activate Mystic Mine (if you drew into it) and set Super Poly (if you drew into it) and then pass turn.

It's mainly a reaction based deck since it plays off well on what you can do to fight back your opponent. Unless they implement a card that lets me spec wightprincess, or wight prince directly from my deck upon normal summon.  There's always something that comes out that helps somewhat. so I'm always playtesting it against the current meta to make sure it can match up and win.  golden lord, floodgates, golden lands, evenly matched/struggling battle are your key control cards.  golden lord is a starter control card. send him and haunted shrine to the grave. to target send cards directly to the grave from field. this is usually when you have no cards on field. if they chain called by the grave or something. you reverse counter chain with haunted shrine from grave removing their target. and that would allow golden lord to flow freely.  if you can't bring out another monster to target with union carrier to mill out wightprince directly from your deck. equip golden lord himself, to union carrier. then proceed to set the conquistador. so you can pop cards.  evenly matched/struggling battle are just for those completely bullshit decks that you can't fight or get rid of that have like 3+ spell cards and field spells out and you can't get rid of them through normal means. literally just skip a battle phase. use evenly matched/struggling battle at the end of the battle phase from hand and nuke their entire field.. (because it doesn't target, and it isn't exactly affecting the cards themselves. This card is bypassing a lot of protections because it is targetting the player, not the card.)  I tried to make this deck give as many ambiguous answers as possible so it can be fluid during combat.  but the basic stratgy involves normal summoning wightprincess/wightprince.  wightprincess mills wightprince.&gt;wightprinces mills lady and wight, and skull servant since it's not once per turn you can keep milling even further. by proceeding to banishing wightprince from grave and bringing out a king of skull servant. link into union carrier and equip golden lord, wightprince, or doomsday horror to return all banished dark cards to grave.  wightprince&gt;link into linkuriboh&gt;Mill out lady in wight and skull servant. Bring out king of the skull servant, then link into union carrier.  The chaos creator is used to spec back union carrier to give you even further options of controlling your deck. say for example you started with garbage hands like 2 skull servants into your hand. you would've discarded the 2 skull servants somehow. Then proceeded to banish them with wightprince or chaos creator, and then send back the excess skull servants back into the deck to balance it out, and special summon wightprince&gt;linkuriboh from grave, or xtra deck to mill back the cards you send directly into the deck."

Made this cute deck a while back then ever since link monsters showed up the deck just died :(. Oh but they introduced a new card its a cute little fairy. The deck still struggles to deal with those dang link monsters but overall its a really solid rogue deck. Winning a game with this deck is like the cleanest best pleasure ngl :). Anyways the way to win is to just lockdown your opponent by setting their monsters face down with the new Ghostrick Fairy card and slowly attack them directly. Theres also some other neat trap cards that can really annoy your opponent. Mystic Mine is in the deck just incase you are having trouble setting up your board and if you need more time. If your opponent can't remove that Mystic Mine and you really want to remove it for whatever reason then use that Renovation and activate that Mansion. There is a lot of cards you can replace but idk what else to replace. Happy Halloween.

Their other big gimmick is their love for Tribute Summoning. Most Monarchs get their effect when Tribute Summoned."
