Boss monsters are the Beetroopers which are all relatively easy to make in the deck (but usually at the cost of banishing resources from your GY) with Invincible Atlas opening up zones to put Deus-X-Krawler with Mind Meld while being beefy and hard to get rid of outside of non-targeting non destructive removal or battle in turn basically locking down the field while you go do your creepy Krawly things. Ballista can recycle whatever you banish for the Beetroopers when she dies and just get one heavy hit in with her debuff (making the Battlewasp an honorary Bee(trooper) *wink*)  Of course you can imagine the strategy is far from meta but as a huge Insect fan I just had to try to mesh them. If I used even more deck slots I probably also would've thrown in Battlewasps but they aren't valid materials for at least 2 of the Krawler link monsters so I decided against them for now (except for Big Ballista who's there to give the deck even more colour and possibly recycle stuff we used for the Troopers)

From there, you can negate every monster effect that your opponent wants to use and beat over huge monsters.  The combo can sometimes need to be changed a bit depending on your opponent's board. For example, If they control no effect monsters then you should go into a different monster than Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara. If they haven't banished any cards, then go into Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing for an optional card draw at the cost of your next draw phase.  This is not a beginner-friendly deck and it takes a lot of time to get good with it but if you do it's very rewarding. I personally think that I have at least 100 hours playing this deck on Yugiohpro so I think I might have a slight addiction to this deck."

Nimble Beaver and Obedience Schooled are both used get Xyz creatures out quickly, great as an opener or for recovering from mass destruction.  Alpha is pretty easy to special summon in this deck, while Behemoth can essentially be summoned for free if you sacrifice a Melffy or two, return it to hand, and then re-summon it at the end of the round.  Kalantosa is actually the main form of removal in the deck. Search for it with Melffy Puppy or play it from hand with Melffy Fenny to destroy something.  Melffy Hide and Seek protects against destruction and allows us to run Torrential Tribute as a trap version of Raigeki while it's active, and can also be used to keep our creatures from Obedience Schooled... although I really don't know if that's all that useful, given our creature's average sizes. As a bonus, card draw's nice once in a while, too.  Pinpoint Landing is free draw and/or removal bait with any Melffy.  Solidarity's pretty decent in an all-Beasts deck, and three copies can work together, so we might as well run all of them.  Xyz Tribalrivals and Melffy's Playhouse are protection for the extra deck and removal, wrapped up in a neat little package.  Xyz Revival Splash and Monster Reborn are both just handy tools for recursion.  Last but not least for the main deck, Closed Forest adds some slight damage boosts to our beasties, and can lock out Field Spells for the opponent.  As for the extras, Melffy Mommy will be the main hitter, with Ronin Raccoon as a good second choice, while Cat Shark and Joyous Melffys are great support."

Here are some tips to that help with very basic plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>Tips</strong> <ul>  	<li>Your combo should start off with going into either Chaos Ruler, Minerva, or Dominion to mill as many cards as possible. This will allow to get everything in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>You send Imperial Order from the deck to the graveyard with the effect of Dominion, then go into Knightmare Gryphon to set imperial order from the graveyard to your side of the field.</li>  	<li>When you banish 3 light monsters to summon Chaos Dragon Levianeer, also banish Chaos Valkyrie too. Activate Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 and Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2. Since chain links resolve backwards, use Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2 to send Archlord Kristya from the deck to the graveyard, then use Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 to special summon Archlord Kristya from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Crackdown and royal decree were sided so they can be used to be sent to the graveyard by either milling or Dominion and set from the graveyard with Gryphon. Other cards like Summon Limit can be used sided as well for the purpose of the Dominion/Gryphon combo.</li> </ul>"

Their team symbol resembles a hexagonal snowflake. They focus on stymieing the opponent's attackers with their defensive monsters and plenty of Spell/Trap Cards to compensate for their inability to maintain hand advantage. The ace monsters of this archetype are <a title=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Brionac,_Dragon_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">the</a> <a title=""Gungnir, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gungnir,_Dragon_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">three</a> <a title=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trishula,_Dragon_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Dragons</a> and <a title=""General Raiho of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Raiho_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">the</a> <a title=""General Gantala of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Gantala_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">three</a> <a title=""General Grunard of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Grunard_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Generals</a> of the Ice Barrier.  &nbsp;  Most ""Ice Barrier"" monsters require another of their kind - usually, but not always, on the field - in order to activate their effects, which are oriented towards field advantage. For example, many ""Ice Barrier"" monsters have effects to protect other ""Ice Barrier"" monsters, be it from attacks (""<a title=""Cryomancer of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Cryomancer_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Cryomancer of the Ice Barrier</a>"" forbids all monsters of Level 4 or higher from attacking while its owner control another ""Ice Barrier"") or card effects (""<a title=""Dai-sojo of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dai-sojo_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Dai-sojo of the Ice Barrier</a>"" protects all of your ""Ice Barriers"" from being destroyed by Spell/Trap Cards). These effects can overlap, making ""Ice Barriers"" capable of creating resilient fields if several of their monsters are out. One of the three Generals of the Ice Barrier, ""<a title=""General Raiho of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Raiho_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Raiho</a>"", does not need other ""Ice Barrier"" monsters for its effect to work, but it can stand on its own as well as complement their lockdowns by taking a toll on the opponent's hand if they rely on monster effects.  Many of the ""Ice Barrier"" monsters are not very useful if alone, making this archetype have issues if not able to establish field presence. While not plentiful, Ice Barriers do have effects of their own to facilitate having several monsters out, such as ""<a title=""Magic Triangle of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Triangle_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Magic Triangle of the Ice Barrier</a>"", and this is also assisted by the effects of their remaining two Generals, ""<a title=""General Grunard of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Grunard_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Grunard</a>"" and ""<a title=""General Gantala of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/General_Gantala_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Gantala</a>"".  The aforementional ""General Gantala of the Ice Barrier"" is one of the archetype's trump cards, being a 2700 ATK monster that can Special Summon an ""Ice Barrier"" monster from its controller's <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">Graveyard</a> during each of their turns' <a title=""End Phase"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/End_Phase"">End Phase</a>. It can revive any ""Ice Barrier"" besides other copies of itself, be it monsters such as ""<a title=""Defender of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Defender_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Defender of the Ice Barrier</a>"" to create or rebuild a defensive field, ""General Raiho of the Ice Barrier"" to apply more pressure, or even their Synchro Monsters, making it powerful and versatile.  ""<a title=""Strategist of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Strategist_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Strategist of the Ice Barrier</a>"" can discard ""Ice Barriers"" from the hand to speed up the Deck. Specific monsters can be discarded by using ""Strategist"" in conjuction with ""<a title=""Medallion of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Medallion_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Medallion of the Ice Barrier</a>"", making revival effects such as ""<a title=""Call of the Haunted"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"" and ""<a title=""Back to the Front"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Back_to_the_Front"">Back to the Front</a>"" viable options to build fields. ""Medallion"" can also be used to gather enough different names for the activation of ""Magic Triangle"".  ""<a title=""Prior of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Prior_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Prior of the Ice Barrier</a>"" is a multi-purpose card - it can be used for its easy Special Summon, quickly enabling another ""Ice Barrier"" monster's effect, or be used for its effect to Special Summon any other ""Ice Barrier"" monster from the Graveyard - the usual target being ""Gantala"", as it can in turn revive more ""Ice Barriers"" turn after turn, but it can revive other monsters for Synchro and Xyz Summons as well. ""Prior"" himself can be easily retrieved by ""<a title=""Salvage"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" and ""<a title=""Surface"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Surface"">Surface</a>"", making it possible to use a single copy of ""Prior"" several times.  For the most part, ""Ice Barriers"" want to establish a solid field and, if possible, keep it. While they are definitely capable of Synchro Summoning with their own <a title=""Tuner monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Tuner_monster"">Tuner monsters</a>, and all of their <a title=""Synchro Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Synchro_Monster"">Synchro Monsters</a> are very good, caution must be exercised - their Tuners themselves have defensive effects you must give up on in order to Synchro Summon, and ""Ice Barriers"" as a whole are not very good at gaining and keeping card advantage.  Due to the archetype's lack of draw power, you can use cards like ""<a title=""Shard of Greed"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shard_of_Greed"">Shard of Greed</a>"" and ""<a title=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Maxx_%22C%22"">Maxx ""C""</a>"".  ""<a title=""Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dewloren,_Tiger_King_of_the_Ice_Barrier"">Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier</a>"" and its ability to return face-up cards to the hand make it possible for players to dedicate a build to it and use a variety of Spell/Trap Cards that remain on the field such as ""<a title=""Swords of Revealing Light"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Swords_of_Revealing_Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>"" to pressure the opponent while you can replay them constantly as long as ""Dewloren"" is around.

I felt like making a deck that doesn't use Halqifibrax. Is that less optimal? Maybe. But hey, I like this version, even if it bricks sometimes. Feel free to make any changes you see fit, since in my experiences this deck can brick sometimes, and its grind game is subpar at best. EXTREMELY fun to use, however.  The idea here is to stop your opponent from gaining momentum. I try to get a normal monster on the board and the funny gun in my hand ASAP so I can make some plays. The archetype's Rituals are highly recommended, but the deck can function without them. The Side Deck just lists some alternatives you can run.  Suggestions and feedback are greatly appreciated!  &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Here's the details:</strong>  <span><strong>The Core</strong></span>  <strong>Normal monsters:</strong> These should be level 4 and I like to have as much attribute diversity as possible. 2 Megalosmashers are present because of the dino Xyz monsters. Overall, run one of each (save for light because Mafteal) and I have Clavkiys at 3 because it's a name in the archetype.  <strong>Maginificent Magikey Mafteal (x3): </strong>One of the main playmakers of the deck, you run no less than 3 of these. It revives a normal monster on summon and gives you an extra normal summon if you control a Magikey while it's in your hand.  <strong>Magikey World (x3): </strong>This is one of the most important cards in the deck. It searches a Magikey on activation and can search the funny gun once per turn. It also protects normal monsters from destruction once a turn. I'd run four of these if I could, that's how important this card is.  <strong>Magikey Maftea (x3):</strong> Speaking of funny gun, here it is. If you control a normal monster, you can use one in the deck for a fusion or ritual summon, which is EXTREMELY helpful.  <strong>Magikey Battle</strong> <strong>(x1): </strong>Good protection for your Magikeys, sadly it only protects them from whatever you chain it to, as well as being once per turn. This is one of the targets for Transfurlmine (the magikey synchro).  <strong>Magikey Unlocking (x2): </strong>Something neat about this card is that after negating a Spell/Trap, it changes your opponent's monsters' attribute on the field to one of your choice, INCLUDING those they have yet to summon. For example, if your opponent wanted to summon Wee Witch's Apprentice, which needs 2 dark monsters. If they use a spell/trap at the start of their turn, you can use Unlocking to negate that and declare something like light. Now, any monster they summon is now a light monster for the turn, so they can't summon Apprentice.  <strong>Magikey Mechmusket - Batosbuster (x2): </strong>Searches ANY Magikey card on summon, so it's very good for that and getting monsters in the grave. It's also a Tuner, so you can use it for Synchro plays.  <strong>Magikey Mechmortar - Garesglasser (x1</strong><strong>): </strong>You can also run 2, but it's very searchable. This is easily one of the best monsters in the deck, and you'll want to summon this if you get it in your hand.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Generic Stuff</strong></span>  <strong>Planet Pathfinder (x2): </strong>Something to search World with in case you don't draw it. Also gives an earth monster for the graveyard, but I still run Trumpeter for the sake of consistency. You won't always need your normal summon, since Mafteal gives you another once you have a Magikey around, so this works fine.  <strong>Rescue Rabbit (x2): </strong>For a deck revolving around normal monsters, this needs no explanation. If you feel like it, you can summon 2 Megalosmashers to make Dolkka or Laggia after you do the rest of your plays. You can also run 3, but I ran 2 since it only has 2 targets in this case.  <strong>Unexpected Dai (x2): </strong>Again, this needs no explanation. I have two since if you hard draw it on any turn after your first, it's useless more often than not. You CAN stack it with World instead of more useful cards for the situation.  <strong>Advanced Ritual Art (x2) and High Ritual Art (x1): </strong>Run however many of these you like, just be sure not to run TOO many.  <strong>Terraforming (x1):</strong> Searches World. Enough said.  <strong>Polymerization (x1): </strong>Summon First of the Dragons with this, that's its only purpose here.  <strong>Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, and Called By the Grave: (x3, 2, and 1 respectively):</strong> Do I really need to explain this?  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Extra Deck</strong></span>  <strong>First of the Dragons: </strong>Very nice card to have, since your opponent most likely can't out it with monsters.  <strong>Magikey Dragon - Andrabime: </strong>If your opponent only has one attribute, this is a Raigeki with wings. You can also draw 1 if your opponent's monster dies. I usually only summon this going second.  <strong>Magikey Beast - Ansyalalalalalalalalabolas: </strong>An Instant Fusion target, as well as something else to load the grave with. It's also a Tuner, like Batosbuster.  <strong>Magikey Fiend - Transfurlmine: </strong>A Trap Hole on legs. Also searches any Magikey Spell/Trap except for World, and it can't be negated with Ash Blossom, since it sets from the deck.  <strong>Any generic Level 8 Synchro: </strong>Ansyalabolas and Batosbuster are tuners, as well as Trumpeter, so why not?. I recommend Dragite in particular for its backrow negate, since its summoning requirements are generic in addition to Megalosmasher's existence.  <strong>Magikey Spirit - Vepartu: </strong>You don't  always want to summon this, but if your opponent has something such as Dragoon or another monster with good protection, he's your guy.  <strong>Any generic Rank 4 Xyz: </strong>Again, most of the monsters here are level 4, so why not? You can also use Rank 8 monsters, but I would only run 1 or 2 of those max. There are some pretty good generic Rank 4 monsters out there like Castel, so I'd run some Rank 4s.  <strong>Any generic Link monster: </strong>Again, if you have the resources to spare or REALLY need something gone, Link monsters are a good option to have just in case. Phoenix in particular has helped me out of some sticky situations a few times."

I always liked the archtype and the support makes it someonewhat better, nevertheless it still is very subsceptible to any kind of hand trap. Its probably the strongest when going second since it doesnt combo very hard and relies a lot on the enemy GY (Dark Ruler or Lighting Storm are options since you cant play around any kind of negates the enemy sets up).  I added the little Utopia engine that is able to get Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray out easily since a lot of vimpire monsters are level 5 and easy to bring out. The ZW-cards also are no real brick on hand because you can Special Summon them most of the time when using a lot effects from vampire cards that drain your HP.  It is more of a casual deck that cant really compete on a meta level. <div class=""QmZWSe""> <div class=""DHcWmd""></div> </div>"

Thankfully, you have much better options. Both Branded Fusion and Magicalized Fusion allow you to go into your boss monster as long as you've drawn one Witchcrafter name or Magicians' Souls. Branded Fusion also serves as a plan B if you don't have any Witchcrafter names, allowing you to send the materials for Lubellion, make Mirrorjade and have a guaranteed way to make Vice-Master on your next turn by searching Branded Fusion with Albion's grave effect.  For me the main reason to play this deck is the interaction between Spell Chronicle and Patronus's grave effect, which allows you to add 5 Witchcrafter spells from the deck to your hand. To make this easier, I'm playing Foolish Burial Goods, which also gives you access to Genni on your opponent's turn with Witchcrafter Masterpiece and can put a Witchcrafter spell into rotation."

Trains ALWAYS want to go second if you have the choice.  If you have to go first, Dragoon is your best option. It's pretty easy to get two monsters on board to make Verte with how trains work. Dora is your second best option if you have to go first (if you know they can out Dragoon easily). In some special cases you can even make both going first!!!  In a recent regional tournament I had a judge rule that Interrupted Kaiju Slumber WILL WORK under Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds' lock as long as one of the targets is a wind monster. So take that ruling with a grain of salt because that's not how it actually works. That makes Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju your best out to Floowandereeze at the moment. <ul>  	<li>The Kaiju engine is to help break your opponents board by removing problem monsters and possibly getting you even more level 10 monsters. Three Jizukiru and Gadarla to help the chances of opening one of them, and only 2 Slumbers because if you draw one Kaiju you would make the third Slumber a dead card in the deck. One Kaiju card + Night Express Knight + Derricrane is usually enough for an OTK in most cases. Kaiju the problem, summon Express, Special Derricrane, XYZ into Gustav and burn for 2000. Then use Derricrane's effect to destroy the Kaiju. Overlay into Liebe, activate effect to make ATK 6000 and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Switchyard is your bread and butter. Don't have the level 10 you need? Just pitch what you don't want and add what you do. Switchyard gets shut down hard by Ash Blossom unfortunately; so you need to try to bait the Ash first if you really need that search.</li>  	<li>Switchyard + Pegasus +Bullet Train = 3 level 10s. Switchyard to pitch Bullet adding Derricrane. Summon Pegasus, activate effect to special Bullet from grave chaining Derricrane. If you already have those three monsters in hand, pitch Bullet to add Bullet, then do the combo again. Only this time you activate the second Bullet in hand for 4 level 10s. That's either a Liebe and a Dora, or a Dora and Dragoon, whichever board is stronger against your opponent.</li>  	<li>Try not to make both Zeus and Dragoon at the same time, they just counter each other and you'll usually end up sending your Dragoon to the grave when you don't want to.</li>  	<li>Urgent Schedule is one of the best cards in the deck. Depending how good or bad your hand is, you can easily end on a Liebe with Dora protection. Or, it'll save you during the battle phase by summoning two monsters (in defense) to absorb some damage. The two best monsters to summon off this are Ruffian and Bullet Train because of their end phase effects to get the cards you need into your hand.</li>  	<li>One funny combo happens when you have Switchyard on field, Urgent Schedule set, a level 10 in the grave, and a derricrane in hand. During your opponent's battle or end phase, activate Urgent Schedule to summon two monsters. Then, activate Switchyards effect to summon a level 4 and it becomes a level 10. Summon Pegasus making it a 10, then activate Pegasus' effect to summon the level 10 from grave chaining Derricrane so that Pegasus' effect won't be negated. 5 monsters summoned during your opponent's turn and they can't even Nibiru you (if you did it during their end phase). Make Dora first for protection on your turn, then do whatever combo you want that will hit them the hardest.</li>  	<li>Bullet Train and Ruffian are two very good cards you always want to send to the grave to get their effects. Ruffian gets you a level 10 Earth Machine from the deck and Bullet gets you ANY MACHINE from you grave. Adding back Pegasus for more combos next turn or Jizukiru to make your opponent worry about losing their boss monster if they can't win that turn. Trains is a mind game that makes your opponent overthink.</li>  	<li>When your opponent over extends, Nibiru them. A nicely timed Nib can stop a lot of decks. Unfortunately, Nib stops some combos, mainly with Bullet Train, but all you need to do is summon one other monster and you can Verte into Dragoon with ease.</li>  	<li>Angher Knuckle is there for when you can't XYZ summon to try to stall for a turn. It does have very good synergy with Bullet Train for card recursion though.</li>  	<li>Pentestag is there to poke through your opponent's defenses if need be.</li>  	<li>Phoenix and Robot Destroyer are there for backrow removal. Destroyer into Liebe into Zeus gets him 4 to 5 material depending on what effects you use, so that makes a nicely stacked Zeus for your opponent to deal with.</li>  	<li>Skypalace with a Derricrane attached is two pops and a 1000 burn that you can overlay Liebe onto.</li>  	<li>BLS is a good option for a lot of decks that do a lot of targeting or destroying like Altergeist. You also make it the correct way with at least one material being a level 7 or higher monster.</li>  	<li>I know it's weird to not main any hand traps, but with the Kaijus, I haven't really had a problem breaking boards.</li> </ul> With everything said and done, this is my current Trains deck and I usually end up in the top 4 with three other meta decks (we usually always split top 4). Nothing will ever come close to the greatness that is TRAINS OTK!!!!"

I don't know Tim personally nor do I have any affiliation, formal or otherwise, with The Wiseguys TCG, channel, which is based in Kansas City--far from my hometown. Nevertheless, I would be remiss to not recognize Tim's contribution to deck-building theory around Buster Blader and Dragon Link in general. Tim topped his locals with a version of this deck I'm about to profile, and then proceeded to go on a multi-week (4+ if [Destruction Sword] memory serves me) undefeated tear at locals with his now-infamous Dragon Link-Fallen of Albaz deck. He's obviously not the first to run Buster Blader with Dragon Link, but this particular build is remarkably strong and solves a lot of the contradictions Destruction Sword decks often face, not least among them being how to play through disruptions. If this seems like a shameless plug, check out Tim and The Wiseguys TCG's videos and see for yourself. For my money, he's probably the best and most creative Buster Blader player in the U. today. YGOProDeck won't allow me to directly link to the YouTube video, so those who want to see Tim's deck should search for 'TOP 4 BUSTER BLADER DRAGON LINK DECK PROFILE FT. TIM - GAME CAFE !' on The Wiseguys TCG YouTube channel.  <span><b>Buuuusted Buster Blader</b></span>  Of all the Duel Monsters-era archetypes in YuGiOh, it often surprises newer players to learn that the most competitively viable among them at present is Buster Blader (also called Destruction Sword). This is not my opinion. As recent as summer of this year (2021), Buster Blader decks were taking respectable finishes in remote duel invitationals around the world, fueled in part--though not entirely--by the Dragon Link-dominated format before Guardragon Elpy got whacked. In May 2020,  Nikolas Konikkos took a relatively pure Destruction Sword deck through day-2 of the Niagra YCS tournament, putting the archetype on the map as a potential answer to DLink players everywhere. Other than the small and opportunistic Dragoon package, which requires players to run at least a single copy of Dark Magician to serve as fusion material, none of the other classic YGO icons have seen anything close to Buster's competitive success in recent years.  The reasons are pretty obvious to anyone familiar with the deck. Even by comparison with bigger YGO icons like Blue-Eyes White Dragon or Dark Magician, Buster Blader's Destruction Sword archetype has a remarkable amount of support available at this point. Destruction Sword/Buster Blader, technically two different archetypes for gameplay purposes, has its own fusion boss monster, level-8 synchro monster and one of the easiest Link-2s to make of all time. Trap cards like Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman avoid so many of the pitfalls of traps in general, sending the Buster fusion spell to the graveyard for cost and thus making it Ash-proof. Shortly after Union Carrier took its place on the Forbidden list, Buster Blader finally had its most potent control weapon returned to him, namely the Dragon Buster Destruction Sword that can completely lock an opponent out of using their extra deck.  Admittedly, Buster Blader decks are always going to have their best times when dragon-heavy decks predominate the format. Dragon Link isn't what it once was, falling precipitously to newer decks like Swordsoul and new blends on old recipes, like Dogmatika-Invoked-Shaddolls. Any given day and all things being equal, a competent Buster deck will wipe the floor with a competent dragon deck, DLink or not, but with fewer DLink decks running around in this format, the natural advantage it enjoyed isn't exactly actionable.  That being said, what makes Buster Blader work so well is its devastating, infamous Buster lock. So long as you have a dragon in the graveyard, resolving Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman will special summon Buster Dragon, a level-8 synchro dark dragon, whose effect turns all of the opponent's monsters into dragons. But if the player chooses to send another trap, Destruction Sword Memories, to the graveyard for Prologue's cost, they will also immediately summon out Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman--a level-8 fusion who (1) turns all dragons on the opponent's field to defense mode; (2) negates the effects of all dragons on the opponent's side of the field; (3) gains 1000 ATK for every dragon the opponent controls or has in-grave; and (4) inflicts piercing damage to monsters in defense position.  If that wasn't enough, Buster Dragon also allows a player to equip a Destruction Sword card in the graveyard to any Buster Blader monster--whether the OG Buster Blader, the retrain Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster, or the fusion--on the opponent's turn. There are three Destruction Sword equip monsters with varying effect, but in general, the only one that absolutely must make the main deck is a single copy of Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. Once equipped, the opponent cannot summon from their extra deck. Wizard Buster Destruction Sword, which as far as I'm concerned makes for an excellent side-deck inclusion at x1 in this format, turns off effects from activating in your opponent's graveyard, making it a great antidote to Invoked-Shaddolls decks. Robot Buster Destruction Sword, the third and least useful, restricts your opponent from activating the effects of spells and traps that are already face-up--potentially useful in some circumstances but it doesn't do enough to earn a spot in the deck, main or side.  The Buster lock is incredibly strong, effectively turning off many key avenues of play for the opponent with the successful resolution of a single card. Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman, a level-1 light dragon tuner, helps tremendously by searching out any Destruction Sword card and adding it to hand if normal summoned. If you have a way to get Buster Whelp into the graveyard--linking off, perhaps--before activating Prologue, it's a one-stop shop for setting up the basic Buster lock, serving as the generic 1 Dragon-type material requirement for making the Buster Blader fusion off of Destruction Sword Memories. With a murderers row of trap cards at its disposal, running Trap Trick x3 substantially raises the odds of getting Prologue set in your opening hand, one way or another. The deck's reliability, lightweight core engine and oppressive control aspects make it a very solid rogue-tier deck choice.  <span><b>Weapons of Mass Destruction Sword: Buster Blader in Dragon Link</b></span>  Without gilding the lily here, DLink puts some meat on the Buster Blader skeleton. To function optimally, the Buster Blader core requires running just 10-12 cards, meaning that it can fit nicely into a variety of other decks and coexist nicely with other archetypes. DLink, maybe ironically, is one of these synergistic decks that provide alternate win conditions and boost the consistency and reliability of establishing and, crucially, keeping the Buster lock in-place. Capable of putting up formidable boards loaded with disruption on its own, a disciplined DLink/Buster player has alternate routes to make Buster Dragon beyond simply resolving Prologue, which itself has the drawback of destroying your special-summoned Buster Dragon during the end phase of the following turn. After all, it's a level-8 synchro--something DLink can consistently make with ease. Dragon Link decks are known for their powerful starters and seemingly endless extenders, much of which results in a heavy graveyard full of dragons and other useful cards after turn-1. Dragons in-grave helps resolve Destruction Sword Memories, sure, but DLink's extenders give the player ways to follow up if somehow the opponent outs the Buster lock.  The temptation, though, is to just plop the 12-card Buster engine on top of a 40+ card Dragon Link deck. Theoretically this isn't a huge problem so long as ratios are kept correct. DLink already has outstanding search capacity and the powerful aforementioned starters/extenders to get things going. The problem is the extra deck. Conservatively, the Buster engine could take up as few as 2 cards in the extra deck, but even with cards like Chaos Space to recycle, this will likely leave the player unable to make followup plays in the event of serious disruption. General wisdom tends to say, 2x Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman, 2x Buster Dragon, 1x Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman. But while Buster's footprint in the main deck is light, he's taking up solidly a third of the extra deck. There's no way to run a full suite of the usual suspects in DLink, which also means that certain main deck staples are just not as necessary--even if they might be useful.  Case in point, I'm not running the Dragonmaid package here. We have plenty of trap-based disruption available as it is, and while this modest three-card package punches far, <em>far </em>above its weight, the deck can't go much higher than 45 cards and maintain its consistency. There's also a growing consensus that in a format marked by liberal use of Droll &amp; Lock Bird, Black Metal Dragon is a safer starter than Starliege Seyfert. I'm not sure if I agree, although I've split the difference here and put both BMD and Starliege at x2.  Similarly, the Rokket package here is far more modest and streamlined than a typical Dragon Link deck should run. Rokket Tracer x2 is a recognition of the importance of the synchro summon in this deck--worth more here than Rokket Synchron's extender effect. Absorouter and Noctovision are run at x1 each, though I would consider upping Nocto to x2 because of its little-used tertiary effect in-graveyard to protect cards set in the back-row. At any rate, the deck has plenty of level-1 tuners to make a level-8 synchro play in a pinch. Hell, even Buster Blader and the retrain are level-7 monsters.  <span><b>Busted Branded: Fallen of Albaz as Additional Disruptions in DLink</b></span>  Whether I'm running the Buster stuff at all or just playing a standard Dragon Link deck, Fallen of Albaz will be in the main deck--and at least three potential targets for his Super Poly-like effect will be in the extra deck. Because Albaz is a level-4 dark dragon-type, he's quite at home in DLink and synergizes well with the rest of the deck. Starliege Seyfert and Chaos Space, for instance, can pitch him to search White Dragon Wyverburster. In a pinch, he can even get our link plays started as a normal summon, allowing us to go into Striker Dragon and search the Boot.  But Albaz is more than another level-4 body. Ideally he doesn't show up in an opening hand, but I don't want to accidentally mill my only copy off of Chaos Ruler either. Running Albaz at x2 seems to work best since he's not a complete brick-draw either. Any worthwhile DLink deck is making Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres as part of its end-board--preferably sooner rather than later in the event of a Nibiru cataclysm. When tributed, Spheres will special summon out a dragon from the deck or hand at 0 / 0, making the effect of whatever dragon summoned from the deck all the more important. In the past, Omni Dragon Broutar was the go-to pick in order to search out Chaos Dragon Levianeer. More recently, Chamber Dragonmaid became the gold-standard for its ability to search its recyclable bounce-trap, Dragonmaid Tidying, immediately upon hitting the field.  Fallen of Albaz offers even greater disruption when summoned off of Spheres' tribute effect. So long as the player has a valid fusion target and a card in-hand to discard--which is easy enough since Spheres can bounce a card from your side of the field as well--Albaz's effect will trigger upon hitting the field, fusing off itself and an opponent's monster as materials for one of these targets.  At a minimum, three fusion monsters are necessary in this build:  <b>Albion the Branded Dragon </b>requires Fallen of Albaz and a light monster. It should come as no surprise to anyone that this becomes incredibly easy to make if an opponent drops Nibiru after you have brought out Spheres. Nibiru tributes Spheres, triggering the effect of the latter and bringing out Fallen of Albaz. Since Nibiru the Primal Being is itself a light monster, Albaz can use the Nibiru summoned to your opponent's side of the field as fusion material for Albion.  Albion's effect is stupid broken, especially in this deck. On summon, Albion can summon a level-8 or lower fusion monster from the extra deck by banishing fusion materials listed on the target from the hand, field or graveyard. In other words, so long as you have a Buster Blader in-hand, on the field or in the graveyard, <b>Albion can make Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman without ever needing to resolve Destruction Sword Memories in the grave</b>.  <b>Borreload Furious Dragon</b>, however, is an equally useful target in this build. For one, if Albaz is summoned while Buster Dragon is on the field, any dark monster on your opponent's side becomes a dark dragon-type monster, allowing Albaz to use it as material. This comes up occasionally, although Furious is more typically a follow-up fusion summon off of Albion's effect. This is Dragon Link--you're never going to have a hard time coming up with 2 dark dragons to banish as materials from the hand, field or grave. Furious itself has a useful quick effect, which allows it to pop a card on your opponent's side of the field by popping 1 monster you control.  <b>Sprind the Irondash</b> <b>Dragon</b>--sadly, a machine-type and not a dragon as its name suggests--has a fine effect itself, which allows it to move to a column during the player's main phase and destroy all face-up cards in the column. This can prove useful, but its real virtue is its astonishingly simple summoning requirement: Fallen of Albaz + 1 Effect Monster Special Summoned this turn. Sprind becomes the miscellaneous Albaz fusion target off of Spheres' effect since most monsters summoned on your opponent's turn meet the criteria. Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, for instance, would generally negate Spheres' bounce effect, but since Spheres tributes itself for cost, Fallen of Albaz will special summon from the deck--and as long as Dragoon was brought out that same turn, Albaz can fuse it and himself off for Sprind.  Additional fusion targets come up, like the ubiquitous Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and even Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. Albion, Titaniklad and Sprind all have end-phase graveyard effects too, which search or recycle Fallen of Albaz and/or related spells (Branded in White, for example). Even as we anticipate the release of even better Albaz fusion targets in next year's structure deck, the basic lineup available today still works remarkably well in Dragon Link.  <strong><span>Tech</span></strong>  Since Artifact Lancea is such a powerful hand trap in this format, Artifact Dagda makes a lot of sense in the extra deck--and by extension, so does Artifact Scythe x1 in the main deck. I could see substituting this out since it more or less constitutes just another way to lock the opponent out of the extra deck--something that Dragon Buster Destruction Sword does already when equipped. For now, I've found it useful as a redundancy in the event that the Buster lock gets disrupted. Halqifibrax would make for a solid substitute since it can tutor out Dragon Buster Destruction Sword with its effect, though I've found I rarely went this route in building the initial board. At any rate, Protector Whelp can send it to the graveyard too for Buster Dragon to equip to a Buster Blader on your opponent's turn.  Red Reign x2 probably looks a lot more gimmicky than it really is in this deck. For one, both DLink and Buster decks are making synchro monsters as part of their end boards, meaning its rare that the card cannot activate. We're also running Trap Trick x2, which can search and set a copy of Red Reign. If I open with Prologue and Trap Trick, Red Reign is the target. With Buster Dragon on the board, along with at least 1 level-8 fusion, Red Reign will banish all monsters except those with the highest level. The surviving monsters are unaffected by card effects other than their own for the remainder of the turn, which prevents your opponent from breaking your Buster lock. Since link and xyz monsters have no level, they are banished by default--something I've used to devastating effect against Tri-Brigade. It's also recyclable from the graveyard with the summon of a level-8 dark dragon synchro-monster, which comes up in a grind game from time to time. As busted as Red Reign plays in this deck though, it only narrowly edged out Gravity Collapse, which I've included in the side deck at x2.  Tim Rokov's videos on this deck and other similar builds utilizing Fallen of Albaz go into greater detail on the potential combo lines, and I'll end by reiterating my props to The Wiseguys TCG YouTube channel. I suspect that as Fallen of Albaz sees greater play in meta-competitive decks over the year to come, Dragon Link players will start to experiment with and incorporate Albaz and his many draconic forms into the deck that never dies."

The undisputed star of Counter Fairies is Bountiful Artemis. This final stage of zombie-camel evolution is from a time before every draw effect needed a once-per-turn clause attached to it. But, this is honestly needed for the deck to even stand a chance against any semi-competent deck. Without the ability to regain the advantage you lose by using all of your Counter Traps, you would be completely beaned after a single turn. Run 3 of this card every time you even think of building this deck.  The next star of the show is Guiding Ariadne. Do you remember playing a game of Yu-Gi-Oh and having the internal debate that all players have at one point in their lives where you asked yourself if activating Solemn Judgment was going to be worth the 4000 lifepoints to activate? Well now you don't have to worry. Ariadne just straight up removes the cost of most Counter Traps, letting you activate all 9 Solemns in one game and even a full playset of Seven Tools alongside it.  The final main-deck monster is Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath. That mouthful of a card really shouldn't be played at more than one. You may look at his summoning condition and yell at me for not including a few more fairies, but to that I say: ""Have you read Rebirth of Parshath?"" And hell, if you're in a tight spot you can still summon him the regular way. I'd just rather not banish my Artemis for a bungus if possible.  The rest of the deck is really self-explanatory. Pot of Extravagance, Pot of Duality, and Card of Demise help you dig for your Artemis turn 1. Sanctuary in the Sky and Sanctum of Parshath both turn on Divine Punishment. Terraforming is just here so you can deck thin a smidgen. And then the Counter Trap suite is all up to preference. I do recommend at least having the three Solemns, Divine Punishment, and Rebirth of Parshath. The rest are all variable, and some other solid options not found in the main or side deck are Black Horn of Heaven, Trap of Board Eraser, Spell Vanishing, Ultimate Providence, and Judgment of Anubis. Do not play Grand Horn of Heaven. Trust me, I tried. The card sounds super cool in practice, but it can't negate a summon that does not start a chain, restricts you to only the main phase, and completely shits itself if your opponent drops Prosperity or Extrav (Ya know, two really good cards that most decks run if they can afford it).  The side deck is just to cover your weak spots. Gameciel does what it has always done and just schlorps up a problem boss monster. Heavy Storm Duster pops backrow and dodge's Imperial Order (which this deck really doesn't care about). Lost Sanctuary is just another copy of Sanctuary that can maybe negate an effect once in a while. To be honest, you can just cut this and run one of the Counter Traps I listed above instead. Seven Tools of the Bandit is just if you really really need to stop traps from activating. And Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell is for killing any Pacifis players dreams of playing the game of Yu-Gi-Oh.  This deck can also run Lord of the Heavenly Prison, which is just a really good card to have in backrow decks. Realistically, you were never losing to backrow removal anyway with your 9 spell/trap negates and 12 monster effect negates, but it's still nice to have a 3k beatstick to close out games. You can also run Prosperity if you really want to dig for the exact card you need. I personally think it's better to get a quick draw 2 in this deck than an extra set of Dualities, but that's just my preference. Another card that pops up in Counter Fairy lists is Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord. This card is terrible, but also extremely funny to resolve. Run it if you're a braver man/woman/everything else in between and outside than I. You can also put actually decent cards in the Extra Deck as well. Realistically you'll never have enough monsters to make a spooky Link or Xyz board, but if you really wanna try and make combo Counter Fairies a reality, I won't crush your dreams."

This description is outdated, I'll write a new one at some point.  """"""Main Deck  Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon is fine at two because its searchable with Beyond and Revolution Dragon and its better to have 2 Arc Pendulum and 3 Revolution because if you need Darkwurm or Persona instead Revolution is a more versatile card to have drawn. Dragonpit is at one to deal with floodgates like summon limit or mystic mine and its also very searchable with Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance to search out Pendulum call. Dharma-Eye is just the best Level 7 Scale 3 or lower Magician Pendulum Monster, giving destruction protection to all of your Magicians for a turn when you Pendulum summon making, it in my opinion, better than the obscure Xiangke and situational Dragoncaller but its effect doesn't come up too often so feel free to substitute it for any of the other two or even another Dragonpit. Gate Zero is at 2 so that your Darkwurm and Dragon Shrines + Foolish Burial are live even if you draw into one copy and its ok to open because its a good scale and useful level for making Absolute. Chronograph is one of your nine starters and its pretty versatile, being useable as a scale 8 and getting you a level 3 magician to make Dawn Dragster if you haven't got the resources to spare for a Celestial. Persona is at one as a low scale to be searched out with Revolution Dragon and a good target for Hieratic if you brick and can't make a full board, its also useful to bring out turn 3 as another negate by searching it out with Skullcrobat. Speaking of Skullcrobat I would run it at three if it were unlimited because its an amazing Stratos-Like Effect that searches your entire deck and its just a shame that is good scale of 8 is hampered by that restriction stopping you from summoning any Supreme King Monsters with it, its the card you want to add off Celestial for follow up plays next turn. Darkwurm comes up a bit too much at three so two is fine to keep your Dragon Shrines live and Still normal summon it occasionally and Darkwurm is at its best if you discard it as the cost for Pendulum Call to then summon it back and essentially go +3, gaining a card on field and a card in hand as well as fetching a Harmonizing to Pend summon later and get its +1 effect. Performapal Celestial Magician is the best scale 8 to end on and you will always want to pend summon it or normal summon it to make Beyond rather than summoning it from deck with Harmonizing so that you can add a Skullcrobat in the end phase. Curtain Raiser needs a reprint and will probably never get one because Konami hates Pends and it serves as the worst starter that you are forced to play because since Astrograph was banned we are in need of more Pends with Special summon effects to use to make Beyond. Harmonizing Magician is amazing and you will usually want to try to use it to summon Dragonpit to make absolute and then tune it with Celestial or if you must because of a bad hand tune it with Timegazer to make Dawn Dragster. Timegazer is a one of garnet that's is absolutely terrible to draw and is only here to be summoned off of Chronograph as a starter. Allure of Darkness is a staple in any deck running DARK Monsters and if you haven't noticed all but two of our main deck Monsters are DARK so run three. Dragon Shrine is the best starter because dumping Darkwurm is great and probably better than Chronograph because its just a more useful type of card advantage than extra spellcasters with bad levels. Duelist alliance is essentially more copies of Pendulum Call and if you already have a Pend Call you can search Arc Pendulum, its also fine to open multiple cos you can search with one then discard the second to activate Pend Call. Foolish Burial is just another Dragon Shrine. Pendulum Call is amazing and I will never run less than three in any deck I ever make ever, you can discard Darkwurm for good advantage and a starter or just discard another card that you opened too many of or isn't live at the moment and it has a neat interaction with celestial where if you use Celestials Pendulum Effect it won't be able to destroy itself but the effect can still resolve. Upstart Exists, always play one in every deck ever unless its a burn deck.  Extra Deck  Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon is easily the best Odd-Eyes Monster being able to shuffle back you previously used Pendulums to Negate anything except a Spell/Trap that activates from the GY, I usually put it in defense position because 3k is pretty good and you can always switch its position next turn. Zeus is hilarious to make going second and the best way to make it is with Utopia int Utopia Prime attack into 4-Material Zeus in MP2. Absolute Dragon is a key combo Piece that you use to make a three material Apolluosa with Beyond and another random Monster meaning it will then float into a vortex as soon as it hits the GY, its other effect is pretty nice to being able to bring back an Arc Pendulum if it negates an attack. Utopia the Lightning is good for Bonking stuff like Dragoon to death and dealing game damage if your opponent is low. Utopia Prime has an effect that might go off like once ever and is mainly a stepping stone to get Lightning and Zeus to 4 materials. Same goes for the regular No. 39. Dark Rebellion is great for doing massive damage and is just fun to use. I've been leaning more towards Adamancipator Risen - Dragite as my ending Level 8 Synchro because you can revive it with Celestial and we already have quite a few Monster Negates so I think it may actually be better to run than Savage Dragon in this deck. Ignister Prominence is the best sort of removal ever and is good to use later game as spot removal, the summon ability is ok so play a single Luster or Master Pendulum if you feel like it. Clear Wing is this decks only board wipe and it also has a pretty good Construct-like effect to destroy before damage calc so its good to have as an option. Dawn Dragster is a good Level 7 to make if you have a Timegazer in your extra deck and one level 7 when you search Harmonizing with Beyond but you don't have any Level 4 Magicians to make Savage/Dragite. Apollousa is possibly the best unbanned/unerrated link 4 in the game and it shows, you wanna make it with Beyond, Absolute and whatever random starter you have left to give it 2400 ATK and still have enough monsters to make a Level 7/8 Synchro, if you can afford it then maybe Unchained Abomination or a Borrel Link 4 would do as a substitute. Beyond the Pendulum is Insane, it searches out any combo piece and has a really good boardbreaking effect that is incredibly easy to chainblock with Harmonizing Magician or Darkwurm, its nuts and I am super Hyped for Dimension Force. Hieratic seal is the last resort option to make if you brick with no starters, get out four monsters, make an absolute then make a Hieratic with the Absolute to get vortex and then when you use Hieratic, summon Persona Dragon is defense position.  Side Deck  this side deck is pretty broad for going against loads of different decks and its also a bit pricey. Sphere Mode is fucking bullshit and if you're willing to give up your normal summon basically any board is toast before it, maybe replace it with a Kaiju if its to expensive. Lava Golem is cheap and is basically a slightly worse sphere mode that still packs one hell of a punch being able to tribute two monsters is still enough to break a lot of boards. Dark Ruler No More, its really great in in this deck fits better than Droplet, Book of Eclipse is an ok alternative if you can't afford a playset of DRNM. D Barrier is possibly one of the most unfair cards that's still legal and since the current Meta is basically free of tribute and Link archetypes aside from Flunders its incredibly lethal to flip as soon as you recognize what deck your opponent is playing. Lastly Judgement is still such a strong card and can stop enemy DRNM or an important summon so yeah pretty good for such ancient card and its always live even if you're at 1 LP.'''  I'll try to list a YouTube video of how to do the main combo at some point if I remember or someone comments telling me too. Also please Konami free our beloved Astrograph and Electrumite and maybe even Monkeyboard if you're feeling generous.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Snipe hunter allows you to dump your entire hand while destroying the field, drawing cards, and special summoning. Use super polymerization to go into big fusion monsters while also possibly sniping your opponent's monsters. This deck is super underrated and I am aware that this is likely a variant better than this but I personally love this version."

It's a hybrid Tenyi build that focuses on some elements of control but also works to swarm the field with monsters while generating a decent hand advantage.  To start, we play three <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a>, three <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a>, two <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a>, two <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a>, two <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and two <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a>, this makes up the core of our Tenyi build. for those of you who don't know all of the Tenyi monsters have the effect to summon from hand, swarming the field so as long as you control no effect monsters, however, while they're in your hand or grave they're secondary effect comes into play. While you control even one Non-Effect monster <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a> can summon a Tenyi from deck, <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a> can banish from hand or grave and target a card your opponent controls returning it to the deck, <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a> can banish to reduce an opponent's monsters attack by 1500, <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a> can negate a card that target's one of your Non-Effect monsters, <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a> can reborn one of your Non-Effect monsters that was destroyed by battle or card effect, and <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a> can add one of your banished Tenyi monsters back to your hand. For the rest of the deck we play two <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> to stop your opponent from gaining too strong a field, two <a data-name=""Mimicking Man-Eater Bug"">Mimicking Man-Eater Bug</a>, that when face down, you are still able to summon Tenyi monsters and when attacked or flipped will target a monster your opponent controls, destroy it, gain that monsters original attack and type, and has the bonus of not being able to be destroyed by monsters with the type you just acquired. In addition, we also run two <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> and three <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> to stop your opponent from attacking. Two <a data-name=""Droll"">Droll</a> and one <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> as the hand traps, a <a data-name=""Called By"">Called By</a> to fill your grave with a Tenyi not in hand, and finally, we're running two <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> to add a Wyrm to hand. Two <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a>, two <a data-name=""Blackout"">Blackout</a> and a <a data-name=""Pank"">Pank</a> for removal, one <a data-name=""Reborn"">Reborn</a>, one <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, and one Metaverse for obvious reasons and one copy of<a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi""> Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a>, what is essentially a pot of greed every time your opponent special summons an effect monster, and it makes your Non-Effect monsters unaffected by monster effects.  For the extra deck, we have three <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> and one <a data-name=""Lanphorhynchus"">Lanphorhynchus</a>, easy link fodder for your main deck Tenyi's. Two <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> to bring back a Wyrm from grave. One <a data-name=""Ra'Ten"">Ra'Ten</a> and one <a data-name=""Sahasrara"">Sahasrara</a> to help flood the field. Two <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> to act as a Non-Effect beat stick. One <a data-name=""Yazi"">Yazi</a> for the synchro, one <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> for spell and trap removal, one <a data-name=""Borreload"">Borreload</a> just in case, and one <a data-name=""World Chalice Almarduk"">World Chalice Almarduk</a> for destruction. The final spot is filled by one <a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a> it can bring back a Non-Effect when it's destroyed, boost Non-Effects attack by 500, lower's effect monster attack by 500.  The side is pretty self-explanatory, <a data-name=""Lancea"">Lancea</a>, <a data-name=""Ash"">Ash</a>, and <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> are all great hand traps. <a data-name=""Dark ruler"">Dark ruler</a> shuts down monster effects, an extra <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection"">Flawless Perfection</a> if you really need to draw it. Two <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a> for negation and possible summons, and two <a data-name=""Dragon Cycle"">Dragon Cycle</a> for searching and summoning.  There's no perfect end board for this deck it's built to adapt and change with games not to OTK your opponent. For the most part, you want to focus on link climbing and spamming with your main deck Tenyi's, setting up a board that has two or three Non-Effect monsters like Monk or Berserker and a few Tenyi's in the grave. You'll want to rely on the disruption this deck provides by using the Tenyi's, Man-Eater Bugs, and Droll's to stop your opponent from comboing off. After that, you can set up with a Vanity's Fiend to prevent special summoning or a Lava Golem on your opponent's side with a Battle Fader in hand or Threatening Roar set to stop their battle phase and rack up some burn damage.  There are a few pros and cons to this Deck I've noticed so far. Pro's: there's a lot of negates and effects in this deck to help you in turn two, it's flexible with what cards can be exchanged from the side deck, and has a lot of removal power against your opponent, and this build plays fairly well through most disruption. Cons: It's only ok going second, it's a little slow, and that pace can sometimes lose you the game, also Gravekeeper, decks that banish your grave, and cards that prevent special summoning counters this deck pretty hard. All in all, I still feel this would be a great build for the locals scene, and a fun deck to play overall. Thanks for reading."

So here it is, a Dinorphia deck profile featuring the 2 new cards revealed to be in Dimension Force. Dinorphia Rexsturm requires a ""Dinorphia"" Fusion monster and another ""Dinorphia"" monster, and Dinorphia Frenzy allows you to Fusion Summon it using a Dinorphia from your Deck AND Extra Deck as material!  &nbsp;  Since this deck is almost nothing but Traps, your goal should always be to go first, and try to summon Kentregina or Rexsturm during your opponent's turn.  &nbsp;  Oh, and speaking of Rexsturm, it has 2 effects. If any monsters on your opponent's field have ATK that isn't lower than your Life Points, they can't activate their effects. And during either player's turn, you can pay half your life points to make those monsters' ATK equal to your Life Points! So it's a good stun card."

Combo starters are Venus, as mentioned above, &amp; a <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> combo that summons <a data-name=""Master Flare Hyperion"">Master Flare Hyperion</a> to copy Venus' effect.

Predaplant got some nice support, and so did Fallen of Albaz, so I slapped them together with a couple Despia, Dogmatika and Shaddoll cards and called it a day!  The main deck is just some standard stuff really. There's 2 Orphys Scorpio, 1 Darlingtonia Cobra, 1 Chlamydosundew and 1 Spinodionaea(for counters), plus 2 each of the new pends Triantis and Bufollicula and 2 Byblisp from Predaplants, along with 2 copies of Predapractice to help board presence and pull more to hand, 1 Predapruning, and the only traps are 1 each Predaplanet and Predaplanning. They have useful on board effects but also offer something while in grave, planning being a destruction and planet being another fusion card. The Shaddoll package is simple, 1 each of Wendi, Ariel, Beast, Squamata, Dragon and Hedgehog. Squamata gives you more mill, Hedgehog pulls one to hand, Wendi summons one from deck, Beast draws a card, Dragon destroys 1 Spell/Trap and Ariel banishes 3 cards from either grave, and since Shaddolls like going to grave, you'll be activating their effects a lot. I also have one copy each of Shaddoll Fusion and El Shaddoll Fusion. El Shaddoll is a target to add to hand when you Nadir Servant El Shaddoll Apkallone since you can set it and quick fuse Winda on the opponent's turn without having to discard for Super Poly. Dogmatika Ecclesia and Fleurdelis are simple staples and offer Light attribute necessary for both El Shaddoll Construct and Albion the Branded Dragon without having to use your extra deck for them. I chose to run 1 Dramaturge of Despia because I like its recursion and board presence, plus it offers a negate, and Aluber gives additional search for Branded Fusion and the other spells like Branded Opening and Despia, Theater of the Branded. The real stars of the show are 1 Springans Kitt offering even more search, and  2 Fallen of Albaz. I run 2 because I've found myself running into trouble using him in hand for a fusion, then trying to use Branded Fusion to pull from deck. There is a third(technically) by using Albion the Shrouded Dragon, but getting it into position to make it count as Albaz for a fusion has proven troublesome, so I tend to use it to send 1 Albaz to grave and swap Albion for something. The remaining cards are Foolish Burial to get Byblisp to proc, 2 Polymerization, 1 Super Polymerization(removal is always nice) 1 Raigeki, and 1 Monster Reborn. So I'm a little scrubby and I like Monster Reborn, sue me.  &nbsp;  The Extra Deck was harder since there were so many good options I had to choose between, but I ultimately decided at base, it's purely fusions. There's so many cards that lock you into fusion only, I did a test hand and ended up with 4 of those restrictions layered on top of each other. Predaplant Ambulomelioides is EXTREMELY integral because it can be fused in hand, search a Predaplant on summon, tribute itself or another monster to then summon another one, and I like to use it to tribute another low level monster, summon Chalmydosundew, then use sundew's effect to fuse into Dragostapelia. Dragostapelia is  a very good card because it has a quick effect predator counter stack, and a continuous effect where anything with a predator counter has it's effects negated. It spreading counters so easily is very beneficial to 2 of this deck's boss monsters, Triphyoverutum and Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon. Triph gains attack equal to every monster with a predator counter's attack so it can skyrocket very easily with Drago, Triantis(if used for a fusion, it applies counters equal to the number of monsters you control) and Spino. In addition, once a turn, Triph can negate 1 Extra Deck summon from your opponent and destroy the monster. SVPFD on the other hand can tribute any monster with a predator counter to negate something your opponent is doing. Any card or effect (that can be responded to) is just negated, simple as that, so if you can manage Drago and SVPFD, which this deck absolutely CAN do, you get 2 negates with this combo. Chimerafflesia is an extra I added, but it's still useful because its requirements mean you can use most of the Shaddolls and a Predaplant and again, does not need to be on board! For Shaddolls, it's just Construct, Apkallone and Winda, that's really all you need. Or at least, all I've ever seen people use from Shaddoll. Construct destroying any special summoned monster in battle before damage calc, Winda locking players into 1 special summon each turn while it's on board, and Apkallone giving a search when sent to grave, and the negate on summon is a nice benefit if you do decide to summon it. I run Despia Quaeritis because it's got flexible materials, and the quick effect dropping non-fusion and low level fusion monster attacks to 0 is nice since this is a fusion deck. I also run Masquerade, the Crimsongleam Dragon because it's more options to put pressure on your opponent if you go first, causing burn for every play they make. I use 1 Albion the Branded Dragon for using with Branded Fusion to send a Dogmatika to grave, so I can then summon Lubellion with it's effect by banishing the Albaz I sent to grave and a dark monster, which then ideally leaves me a Shaddoll in hand I can discard, or one in grave that I then fuse into Construct. I've done a lot of tests on running optimal lines for this, and this gives you three fusions on board, and only needs a little grave setup prior. I have Titaniklad because sometimes damage is necessary, but it doesn't do a whole lot else other than maybe be a Nadir Servant target or even a Super Poly choice. Mirrorjade is nice for its quick effect non-targeting banish and is a good option if you don't want to make a board full of fusions and only want a couple, both Albion and Lubellion lead really nicely into it. This just leaves Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and, it's just good. Any 2 Dark monsters on field so it is a great Super Poly target to remove troublesome boss monsters like Accesscode Talker, Borrelsword Dragon, Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, Destiny HERO Destroy Phoenix Enforcer, all sorts of nasty stuff just so happens to be Dark, and if Starving Venom gets destroyed, it'll destroy any and all special summoned monsters on your opponent's field it can.  I wanted this deck to have options, and usually, thanks to all the search, I consistently get 3+ fusions on board. Out of all the tests, maybe 5 duels I ended with 2 or fewer monsters turn one, and the remaining like, 40, i've had at least 3, most often 4 monsters on board, and this deck can even pump out a completely full board with Winda, Construct, Drago and Dramaturge.  Also pls no bulli, this is my first attempt at seriously building a deck, I've just been netdecking until now but the new support was too juicy for me to not experiment with. I don't use side decks so I just slapped in whatever."

I like this current build more than the rest I've put together but pl,So this deck can brick a bit but there are some decent plays for sure. I find going second works more of the time just for that extra draw. Main strategy is trying to get hit but also using dark renewal and magical dimension to get an easy monster off the field. Be creative with your food magician girls. My usual go to is using Berry to get kiwi in my hand. When the deck works it is a lot of fun and a satisfying win. Please hit me with some improvements!
