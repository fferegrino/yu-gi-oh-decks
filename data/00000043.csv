The decks biggest strenght is its consistency, with how many 1 card combos and free extenders the deck has makes it so it doesnt brick very often and even if it does there still a high chance that you'll still get some form of interruption up. 2. The decks flexibility makes it so it can be played in alot of differnt ways ways adding in a gold pride engine to use alongside the P.u.n.k cards and with Grand Bash lets the deck use almost any XYZ monster as long as you play other goblin cards for example by using a card like goblin zombie you gain acces to both rank 4 and 7 XYZ monster while&nbsp; goblin zombie also has the abillity to search any of Goblin Riders when its sent from the field to the grave.</p><p>Now for the decks weaknesses 1. the deck can have a pretty hard time going 2nd against a lot of the stronger deck even though the the deck can usally play through 1 or 2 distruptions going 2nd but with some hands it can struggle. 2. this deck is another basic combo deck that just looses hard to droll and nibiru but with nib its still possible to get gossip shadow out before they can activate it but with droll if you dont open called by it can just end your turn a lot of the time.</p><p>now for as the last thing i'll go over 2 1 card combosthe first is for Terrortop and Ze Amin and 1 for Tour Guide, even though they end on the same board the Tour Guide one still uses a few less resources and gives you more to work with.</p><p>One Card Ze Amin replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134861</p><p>if you openend Terrortop or Ze amin, make Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect to special itself, Dugg effect to add Grand Entrance, use the 1st effect of Grand Entrance to add Mean Merciless and the 2nd to special it, overlay Dugg and mean into Alucard then overlay it into Angel of mischief, Angel effect detaching Alucard&nbsp; to add ghostrick shot, shot effect to revive Alucard once again overlay Alucard into Angel, both Angels overlay to make F0 into UFD, use Grand Entrance 3rd effect to detach a xyz material and add Dugg back to hand the use Means grave effect to revive itself by detaching a xyz materiel and on summon special Dugg overlay them for Armor Torpedo then activating its effect to draw 2 then overlaying for Armor Fortress then Fortress effect to add Full Armored XYZ.</p><p>the Tour Guide version of this combo is a little bit different</p><p>One Card Tour Guide Replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134739</p><p>Summon Tour Guide, Tour Guide effect summon Rhino Warrior, overlay for Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect detaching Rhino Warrior, CL1 Dugg CL2 Rhino Warrior, Rhino Warrior dumps Mean merciless, Dugg adds Grand Entrance, Grand Enctrance adds and specials Clatter Sploder, Clatter effect to summon Mean from grave overlay Clatter and mean for alucard to do the UFD line, then use Means grave effect to summon itself, use it and Dugg to over lay into Armor torpede and do the Full armor line</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It can however be modified to make negates such as through Firewall.</p><p>The main field you want to end with is wiccid in one of the extra monster zones with invalid dolmen directly underneath and accelerator to the right of dolmen. This creates a lock that makes your monsters unaffected by other monster effects, your monsters cant be destroyed by card effects and your opponent must battle dolmen who with the help of accelerator can get to 4800 attack. Accelerator can be switch out for honeybot, it just depends on how many monsters you can bring out.</p><p>When going first I suggest just putting in as many cyberse monsters who can special summon themselves to prevent a much damage from nibiru. If your opponent is playing nibiru every game, sub in the firewall package or better cyberse link monsters to end in a substantially sized Arrival Cyberse (its better than nothing).&nbsp;</p><p>When going second, I suggest subbing in dark ruler, droll and evenly (anything to prevent interuptions). When subbing I take out 1x Reborn, 1x f.a.ighting spirit, 2x parallel exceed, 2x upstart goblin, 1x meet you and 1x mathmech addition.</p><p>I wanted to make a mostly pure @ignister deck, it is by no means perfect but it will definitely give some decks a challenge. It is pretty fun to use in a semi competitive setting. If you have any ideas to make this deck better please comment.</p>"

Darling it's better dow- Oh you dead.,"<p>And here is the Sea Serpent-flavored White Fish deck I promised you. I replaced most of the ice themes with deeper waters (Ran Aegirine is still a free Gymir). Honestly, this is probably the weaker and less consistent version of the two, but I love and am equally committed to all of these engines. I even sided a tiny Mermail package. I didn't want the deck to go over 40 since you want to see Diva more than anything, but maybe you could take out one Heavy Infantry and something else. The idea on that is to add Abyssteus to hand with Abyssalacia so you don't have to waste Abyssdine's summon on your opponent's turn. But I digress.</p><p>Summoning Guitar Gurnards Duonigis, hands-down the coolest Sea Serpent, with Diva gets you level 7 or 8 synchros. With all your free summons, it just snowballs from there. Atlanteans do Atlantean things to hand-loop; DS Minstrel is an anti-handtrap; and the other Deep Seas are extenders when discarded/ss'd. Chengying might be a better pick than Bihamut, who just starts with higher attack. I wanted a big beatstick to contend with ""unaffected"" monsters. Duonigis does give an attack buff from the gy.</p><p>Sadly, we are only getting 1 Toad off of Bahamut Shark with this deck. The only level 2 Aqua that would fit with this deck is Swap Frog, and trying to field 2 of him is just too hard. Plus I don't wanna pay his tax when I could still run Ran instead. Boy I'm looking forward to these water cards. I hope they're not expensive.</p>"

Yata-Lock,"<p>Greetings! Are you a fan of Yata-Lock and Destiny Board? If you like both, this deck is for you. Also, compared to <strong><a href=""/deck/destiny-of-panda-334834"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my</a> <a href=""/deck/350771"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">previous</a></strong> Destiny Board setups I did, this one was easy to execute because the chance of hitting bricks are reduced. Alright, let's get started!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/21eiYg0v6Sc"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Draw until you find these combo pieces: Yata + Droll + Miracle Locus + Disturbance Strategy + Destiny Board. Meanwhile, bring forth Apollousa + Baronne. Then, set Disturbance + Miracle + Destiny and end your turn but not before changing the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"". You don't want to miss anything happening, do you?</p><ul><li>As seen in the video, I was about to discard my key pieces. Therefore, shuffle other letters with Saryuja to not risk them being sent to GY. If you are really concerned, you can add 1 x Infinite Cards as a workaround for discard issue, seen in ""Side Deck"". When you are about to place last letter, you can destroy ""Infinite Cards"" with Baronne anyways, so backrow space isn't an issue.</li><li>Similar to Dugares which can draw cards and skip your next Draw Phase to not deck-out, Daigusto can refill your Main Deck. As a mini ""Pot of Avarice"" with XYZ body, feel free to replace Dugares with Daigusto, if you wish. You can check Daigusto in ""Side Deck"".</li><li>""Sword of Deep-Seated"" was added to solve issues of deck-out. As you place letters with ""Destiny Board"", it will be inevitable you draw cards, leading into deck-out. By applying Deep-Seated to Yata, when you hit End Phase, Deep-Seated will be automatically destroyed after Yata has returned to your hand. As its ability, Deep-Seated will be placed on top of your Main Deck...<ul><li>Sabres can achieve the similar thing by shuffling one of your cards from your hand on top of your Main Deck to Special Summon itself. To make it a loop, you have to destroy Sabres with Baronne. You can check Sabres in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul></li></ul><p>2) During your opponent's Standby Phase, activate Miracle to let your opponent draw a card. Then, activate Disturbance and chain into Droll. What will happen is Droll denies for either side to add any card to their hand. Therefore, by shuffling your opponent's hand into deck with Disturbance, they won't be able to draw/add any card afterwards, all thanks to Droll.</p><p>3) Your opponent has nothing to do but pass the turn back to you. However, before that, activate ""Destiny Board"" if you haven't already at End Phase of your opponent and start placing letters. When it's your turn, destroy ""Chicken Game"" if present and Normal Summon Yata-Garasu. Attack the opponent with Yata, which denies your opponent from drawing any card.</p><p>4) Your opponent will be stuck forever. So, they can either surrender or wait for animation of ""Destiny Board"", as long as you repeat what was explained in #3. Either way, you win the duel!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Destiny Board"" can be found within ""The Trap in the Wicked Castle"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Mannadium Trisukta"" can be found within ""Indomitable Pride"" Timed Pack to save 30 SR!

Dinosaurs/ Dinowrestlers</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">1200+ word article.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">(In April 2023, I burnt out from being a teacher and applied to be a YGOPROdeck writer for some scratch cash for hobby writing. I sent a few articles and remember getting good feedback but then got ghosted. It didn't matter much anyways because even if I had gotten hired, my new job overwhelmed me to have little time to play YuGiOh or keep up with product)<br /><br />I found this lesson article written hastily in a week for that position on my pc and decided to upload it here.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are some of the most versatile Extra Deck monsters in the YuGiOh trading card game, capable of being summoned using generic material. Link monsters can also add more strategy to a player&rsquo;s extra deck and helping a player get out of a situation with no other meaningful plays. With their inclusion, players are also encouraged to consider which zones to place monsters, spells, and traps.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">However, Link Monsters are arguably trickier to summon in contrast with their previous Extra Deck monster types: Fusions, Synchros, and XYZ with regards to Link Zones and Link Ratings. With the latest Wild Survivor Set bringing Dinosaurs back to the forefront, and seeing many players at my locals get into the game with the Traptrix structure deck, I wanted to write an introduction on how to Link Summon, using the Dinosaur archetype as an example and to see how the Dinosaur archetype link climbs with the new card support!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Summoning Basics</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Summoning is most often performed by using Monsters a player controls as Link Material for a Link Monster. During their Main Phase, if the game state is open, the turn player can Link Summon a Link Monster from their Extra Deck by sending face-up monsters they control that correspond to the Link Monster&rsquo;s summoning requirements equal Link Monster&rsquo;s Link Rating to the Graveyard as Link Materials. The Link Monster is Summoned in either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster on the field points to in face-up Attack Position.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Ratings are defined by the number on the Bottom Right, in the place where most monsters have a defense point number. The Link Rating is formed by the addition of Link Monster ratings and non-link Monsters used for the summon. For instance, the Link Monster Saryuja Skull Dread has a Link rating of 4 and has the Link Material requirement of &ldquo;2+ monsters with different names&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you could use a 4 monsters, a Link 3 and any other monster, two Link 2&rsquo;s, etc. Another way to think of this is a non-link monster can be thought of as a Link 1 material.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are unique in that they are monsters that have no defense and can only be in face-up Attack Position, a condition that no other monster type has. Thus, cards that force monsters to be in defense position such as Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir or Scareclaw Tri-Heart have no effect on Link Monsters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Arrows</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Arrows are important as they give positions for which other Link Monsters can be summoned. However, more importantly, Link Monster often have abilities that correspond to the place where their arrows point.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are Summoned in either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster on the field points to in face-up Attack Position. A player can only use one Extra Monster Zone. However, a player can claim both extra monster zones if their link monsters point to both monster zones, which is a very impressive feat. Unlike other extra deck monster types, which are free to be placed anywhere on your board, Link Monsters must be summoned to a zone a Link Monster Points to, otherwise they must be in the extra monster zones. As such, a player must be careful which zones they summon to. For instance, if a player fusion summoned a monster with a spell and placed that monster in the extra monster zone, and had no other link monsters, that player cannot link summon unless they use that fusion summoned monster as material.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Arrows are important because many Link Monster have special varying based on their Link Arrows. For instance, the Link 3 monster card Transcendonsarus Exaraptor has Link Arrows Pointing Up, Left, and Right. Its ability states that if a face-up Dinosaur monster(s) this points to is destroyed by battle or sent to the GY: You can draw one card. So, in the case of a dinosaur deck, a player could be encouraged to use the cards Lost World or Dogoroan, the Mad Flame Kaiju to summon a dinosaur in a zone that will point on the Link 3 monster will point to and destroy it later.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"">As a bit of trivia, upon release, players were not allowed to summon any Extra Deck monsters outside the two Extra Monster Zones unless linked. As such, link summoning on release was wedged into the game, and many players disliked the mechanic. Decks had to shoehorn link summoning into their deck. Alternatively, many tournament players used decks that did not utilize the extra deck at all such as Monarchs or True Dracos or used decks that banished Extra Deck monster such as True King Dinos.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Archetypes/ Strategies</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are arguably the most versatile extra deck monster, requiring none of the specific monster levels that Synchros and XYZ require nor the Specific monsters that Fusions require. In addition, Link Monster have a host of generic support such as Knightmares, which can be used for spot removal, or Charmers. In addition, with boss monsters such as Appaloosa Bow of the Goddess and Accesscode Talkers, Link monsters are great for many decks that can produce many creatures in one turn. In addition, the classic sideboard card Dimensional Barrier does not prevent Link Monsters from being summoned from the extra deck and provides an alternate series of deck types against these duels. Duelists are encouraged to experiment with extra deck archetypes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Several Archetypes revolve around Link Summoning multiple times to climb to more and more powerful monster. As such, the term Link Climbing became slang for using another Link Monster as material. Some classic decks include Salamgreats, Sky Strikers, @Ignister. Dinosaurs have their own specific archetype: Dinowrestlers, but most meta Dino decks splash generic Link Support for their strategy. As such, Duelists are encouraged to experiment with several rations of their monsters alongside other extra deck archetypes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For this example, many Dinosaur Decks run many generic and niche Link cards to support this strategy. Link monsters are also great for extending plays or setting up future players. For instance, Dinosaur decks often use card Animadorned Archosaur to search for Double Evolution Pill. In order to achieve the requirements of a non-dinosaur monster for Pill, a player can link away Animadorned Archosaur with Linkuriboh, a Link 1 that can stall the game but also achieve the second monster necessary for pill.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As a general guide, Link Decks would be advised to count their summons up to 4 in case of a Nibiru hand trap, which can be catastrophic against a Link Deck. If a player summons 5 or more monsters during their turn, Nibiru can be activated to tribute all monsters on the field. Against Link monster, this will end with each Link Monsters being tributed for 0 def. As such, players are advised to stop at 4 or end with a monster negate such as Apolloussa, Bow of the Goddess.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I hope this guide helped introduce you to the Link Summoning. While I had originally wanted to describe Link Monsters in Dinosaur decks, I was surprised to discover their rich and jaded history. I started the game a little confused with Link Monsters and Link scales, so I hope this guide makes players less confused and more intrigued. Today, I always manage to splash a few link monsters into most of my decks with their sheer versatility. I&rsquo;m always excited to see more Link monsters being released into the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Running the D/D/D/D Boss for possible in-engine floodgate boardwipes from hand. (Buster Lock, Bagooska, Skill Drain, etc.) This deck can run basic 1 card combo's, however requires lots of practice and experimentation to make full use of the 2 and 3 card combos the deck offers. Attached is a link to the D/D/D starter combo guide: <a>https://www.masterduelmeta.com/articles/guides/d-d-d-combo-guide-yusodus</a></p><p>This deck is not running D/D/D Oracle so certain combo lines from the combo guide are limited due to an emphasis on board breaking/interruption with Super Polymerization. The deck is fairly consistent, however on brick hands you can set Super Poly and pass with Maxx C, to hopefully fuse into Garura or Mudragon using your opponent's board. You can fuse into Garura to out a Nibiru and Nibiru token as well with Super Poly. I would recommend playtesting this deck on EDO Pro or YGO Omega, however it's fairly cheap in Master Duel compared to newer Meta decks. D/D/D is a very fun deck to learn, as well as experiment with. You can run the Zeus, Vice King Build. Kali Yuga Lock build with Wonder Xyz, as well as Doom King build.&nbsp;</p><p>Example Combo:</p><p>1 Card Kepler to summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga: Normal Summon Kepler - Add Dark Contract With the Gate - Activate Gate's effect - Add D/D Gryphon from deck to hand. - Special Summon D/D Gryphon using Gryphon's effect - Link into D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh - Place Scales D/D Orthros, D/D Savant Thomas - Activate D/D Savant Thomas's pendulum effect to add Kepler from face up extra deck to hand - Activate D/D Orthros pendulum effect to pop D/D Savant Thomas and Dark Contract with the Gate - Place Kepler in Scales - Pendulum Summon D/D Savant Thomas and D/D Gryphon - Activate D/D Savant Thomas's field effect to summon D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok from deck - Xyz Summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga using D/D Savant Thomas, and D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy, and have fun experimenting, as D/D/D has a ton of great combos.</p>"

Primal Seed + Morphing Jar #2,"<p>Hey, how you doing? A while ago, I <a href=""/deck/morphing-jarpot-422574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>won</strong></a> with Jackpot 7 by utilizing Morphing Jar #2. However, there was a chance you could fail. This time, as long as you have time to establish the setup needed, you can absolutely win with Jackpot 7 alongside MJ2 by disregarding any margin of error. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLUP6su5LmU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant at least one flower to opposing side with ""Black Garden"" and play ""Double Summon"". Double will be used for putting MJ2 as Set.</p><p>2) When you have 4 cards in your Main Deck, Link Summon Saryuja and activate it. There, you draw all remaining cards and shuffle back three, which has to be ""Jackpot 7"".</p><p>3) Special Summon Kuriboh with Saryuja and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, place MJ2 as Set.</p><p>4) If you have Main Deck monsters on the battlefield, other than Chaos + Kuriboh + MJ2, get rid of them by passing to opposing side with ""Mystic Box"" while eradicating the flowers. When you have only these three, only pass MJ2 to your opponent with ""Mystic Box"" for one last time.</p><p>5) When you have ""Monster Reborn"" + ""Monster Reincarnation"" in your hand, activate ""Book of Taiyou"" on MJ2 to open it. While MJ2 triggers, you will shuffle back Chaos + Kuriboh + MJ2 to your Main Deck and in the end, MJ2 will be placed as face-down while Chaos + Kuriboh were sent to GY.</p><p>6) Besides the events happening in #5, there is a chance you can hit all three Jackpot 7 cards. Since MJ2 was placed to your opponent's side, the effects coming from MJ2 were considered to be done by your opponent. Therefore, by milling all three Jackpot 7 cards, you win the duel. Even if you own MJ2, this fact won't change...</p><ul><li>However, the excavate effect of MJ2 isn't guaranteed to find Jackpot 7 cards since you shuffle your Main Deck. If you miss any one of Jackpot 7 cards, that means you have to repeat same setup done in #4 + #5.</li><li>In order to do so, first play ""Monster Reborn"" and target on Kuriboh. Reason is that, in case you didn't realize already, ""Winged Kuriboh LV9"" sends any activated Spell cards into BZ instead of GY. Since ""Primal Seed"" can only fetch cards from BZ, I think you see the pattern now.</li><li>With Kuriboh present, you can play ""Monster Reincarnation"" to add Chaos Emperor from your GY back to your hand. Return from BZ to GY, 1 x LIGHT + 1 x DARK monster, with ""Burial from a Different Dimension"" and Special Summon Chaos Emperor via its ability. Your ""Primal Seed"" loop is completely restructured.</li><li>While Special Summoning monsters, ""Black Garden"" is going to plant flowers to opposing side. Give MJ2 to the opponent with ""Mystic Box"" and fetch all combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"" loop, which are Mystic Box + Monster Reincarnation + Monster Reborn + Different Dimension + Book of Taiyou. Finally, play ""Book of Taiyou"" on MJ2.</li></ul><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #6 until you have milled all three Jackpot 7 cards with MJ2 to win the duel!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Jackpot 7"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 690 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

This deck is simply brilliant, as it represents the 9 Deadly Sins, and not just the traditional 7, as many think. The Catholic Church has tried to hide two of these sins, but we will not let this go unnoticed.</p><p>Let's start with Asmodeus, the sin of Lust, represented by the card ""Darklord Asmodeus"". This card is as powerful as it is tempting. The next sin is Gluttony, represented by Beelzebub and the card ""Darklord Tezcatlipoca"". Mammon represents Greed with the card ""Darklord Desire"" and Belphegor personifies Sloth through the card ""Darklord Nergal"". Azazel that represents Wrath is actually the card ""Darklord Nasten"" and a Daemon (sin Envy) that represents the card ""Darklord Amdusc"". We cannot forget the powerful Lucifer, Pride himself, who manifests himself in the card ""Darklord Morningstar"".</p><p>But the fun doesn't stop there! We also have Zarathos, representing Heresy with the card ""Darklord Zerato"", Ixchel representing Idolatry with the card ""Darklord Ixchel"" and the two ""Darklords"" who do not represent capital sins, but rather human evil who are &ldquo;Darklord Indulged&rdquo; who represents lack of faith, &ldquo;Darklord Capricious&rdquo; which represents Vanity. Darklord Condemned, who represents ""sorcery"" and Darklord Ukoback, the servants of demons who are the opposites of guardian angels.</p><p>And to finish with a flourish, we have the imposing ""Darklord Lord Edeh Arae"", who represents Death. In Japan, he is known as a shinigami, a demon tasked with taking souls to the underworld. He is a demon general who controls a legion of demons, being subordinate to demons of higher hierarchy. His power is such that he can cause the death of anyone in several ways, with cardiac arrest being his favorite.</p><p>The treacherous shadows are lurking, ready to seduce you with all the worldly pleasures, causing you to gain weight and settle in darkness. You will be enveloped in dark comfort, but beware, for the last meal will be your own being, devouring you slowly, without mercy. My dear sinner, and come join us in the infernal abyss, where terrible fate awaits you. Haha ha!</p>"

Fusion Gate + Starving Venom + Primal Seed,"<p>Welcome! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" thanks to ""Independent Nightingale"". With Banisher and Fusion Gate around, you can cycle mats needed with ""Primal Seed"", making it a complete loop. Let's go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFSIN-sKf30"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) First, place a plant to your opponent's field with ""Black Garden"". Next, bring out Swallow and play ""Cattle Call"" to replace it with Nightingale. Then, give Nightingale to opposing side by replacing the flower with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>2) After you have Link Summoned Saryuja, Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>3) Place ""Fusion Gate"" and raise the level of Nightingale to 5, which is needed to copycat Nightingale with Starving. Then, Special Summon Jester with its ability to Link Summon Barber by using Saryuja + Jester as materials.</p><p>4) Since the Special Summon ability of Jester isn't hard-once per turn, you can repeat it as many times as you like. Fetch Jester from BZ with ""Primal Seed"" and Special Summon it. Then, activate ""Fusion Gate"" to Fusion Summon Starving by using Barber + Jester as materials.</p><p>5) Copycat Nightingale with Starving to deal 8 x 500 = 4000 damage in total. Since the copycat ability of Starving isn't hard once-per turn, you can repeat it. To do so, return Barber + Jester to Extra Deck and hand with ""Primal Seed"". Then, Special Summon Jester with its ability to Link Summon Barber by using Starving + Jester as materials.</p><p>6) Special Summon Jester and return Starving to Extra Deck with ""Primal Seed"". Then, Fusion Summon Starving with Barber + Jester. In short, repeat these steps explained in #4 + #5, while copycatting Nightingale with Starving and pulling the trigger, until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Remember, you can repeat this process by resetting Plump with Book spells and it shouldn't contain more than 9 materials.

Once upon a time, I have done a FTK setup with <a href=""/deck/reunion-of-venom-bros-409183"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Independent Nightingale,</strong></a> where every single variant of Venom Fusion monsters were used to burn your opponent to death. This time, Venom Bros are up to task to mill your opponent with Librarian. Let's go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNvyVNhvxCA"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant all five flowers to opposing side with ""Black Garden"". Next, Link Summon Saryuja and place ""Fusion Gate"".</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, give Librarian to opposing side by getting rid of a flower and replacing with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>3) With ""Primal Seed"" loop and probably Panda/Reborn, Fusion Summon all Venom Bros with ""Fusion Gate"" and activate their abilities to copycat Librarian. Then, replace flowers with them via ""Mystic Box"", similar to how you did in #2 for Librarian. Here is an example of Fusion Summon order and note that ""H"" is for in-hand and ""F"" is for field:</p><ol><li>Fusion Summon ""Supreme King Dragon"" by using Odd-Eyes (H) + Zero King (H) as materials. Don't copycat with ""Supreme King Dragon"" just yet.</li><li>Fetch Odd-Eyes with ""Primal Seed"" and Fusion Summon ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" by using Supreme King (F) + Odd-Eyes (H) as materials. Copycat Librarian with Venom Dragon and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fetch Odd-Eyes + Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and try Fusion Summoning ""Supreme King Dragon"" again. This time, you can copycat Librarian with Supreme King and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom"" by using 2 x DARK (F) as materials. As long as you don't use Chaos Emperor as material by accident, you will be fine. Just like the others, copycat Librarian with Starving Venom and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fetch Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and Fusion Summon ""Starving Venemy"" by using DARK (H or F) + Zero King (H) as materials. Similar to previous setup, don't use Chaos Emperor as material by accident. Copycat Librarian with Venemy and replace Librarian with Venemy by destroying Librarian with ""Mystic Box"".</li></ol><p>4) If you have done everything correct so far, there should be 4 x Venom monsters disguised as ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"", ready to mill your opponent. Refill the last spot by reviving Librarian with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroying the flower with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>5) Fetch Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and Special Summon Zero King with Saryuja. Tribute any two monsters but Chaos Emperor with Zero King to shut down anything your opponent can activate from Hand + GY + Backrow in the future.</p><p>6) Choose a monster you are going to Synchro Summon over and over again with ""De-Synchro"". I picked Ancient by using Panda + Martial as materials but any Synchro will do. Arrange your monsters accordingly with Panda and Reborn, if you must.</p><p>7) Each time you Synchro Summon, your opponent is going to draw 5 cards. Repeat what was explained in #6 until your opponent is out of cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"" can be collected by purchasing ""Magician of Pendulum"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Zero King Rage"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" can be found within ""Draconic Resplendence"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"" can be found within ""Celestial Dragon and Bear"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Black Garden + Fusion Gate + Land Flipping,"<p>Welcome! This is a basic deck, where the aim is to burn your opponent with Volcannon by targeting Jizukiru forever. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEbNfgoEL1k"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Activate ""Black Garden"" and ""Fusion Gate"". To make sure either are present on the field, pass one of them to your opponent with ""Land Flipping"".</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, replace a flower with Jizukiru. In return, ""Black Garden"" is going to plant a flower to your side, just like how you refilled your opponent's side by Summoning monsters on your side.</p><p>3) When you have Inari in your hand, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to change everything as&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>into&nbsp;<strong>Machine.</strong> Next, activate ""Fusion Gate"", wherever it is, by banishing Inari from your hand and any monster but Chaos Emperor from your field as materials to Fusion Summon Volcannon.</p><p>4) Target Jizukiru with Volcannon to deal original ATK of Jizukiru as damage to your opponent, which is 3300. Volcannon doesn't look at ATK modifications done on the field. Instead, Volcannon checks the ATK of monster in GY, that's why the damage output was higher than it would seem.</p><p>5) With Jizukiru + Volcannon being destroyed, banish them with ""Soul Release"". Then, fetch Jizukiru + Inari to your hand with ""Primal Seed"" and return Volcannon to Extra Deck with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>6) To make it a loop, repeat these steps from 2 to 5, until your opponent is dead. Since you will always get a flower by placing Jizukiru to your opponent's side thanks to ""Black Garden"", you can always Fusion Summon Volcannon without any issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Volcannon"" + ""Land Flipping"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Try to summon Junk Speeder as soon as possible, and summon Satellite, Jet, and Junk Synchron from the deck, if you have to summon Quickdraw along side, just try to keep Road Synchron in your deck as much as possible. If you used Dopplewarrior for the synchro summon, activate his effect after Junk Speeder to get the two tokens. After that you can go into Crystal Wing if you cannot extend, or the appropriate synchro for the situation. They are a few ways you can summon Shooting Quasar on your first turn, however you can only get it with Junk Speeder(5), Scarred Warrior(5), Stardust Charge(6), Accel Synchro(tuner and adjustable levels wanting either 1, or 2) or Synchro Formula(2). If you can get Speeder/Scarred out with Stardust Charge, and Accel Synchro, you will want to send Road Synchron to the grave to reduce the level by 4. If you have Speeder, and Scarred, you can use either Formula, or Accel Synchro by sending Junk Synchron to the grave. Either way, you will be able to get other monsters out if you cannot go for Quasar.</p>"

Futhermore, you want to maximize your Lvl 3 monsters : Tour Guide is not a mandatory choose in my opinion</li><li>I put Berserk Archfiend at 3, since you have no way to found it in the list (some ways exists with Archfiend Heiress, but it's not that worth IMO and that increases your numbers of bricks, force you to play Tour Guide, etc...)</li><li>As you have 3 Berserk Archfiend, 1 Shyama is enough (Berserk Archfiend + Unchained Lvl3 monster = full combo)</li><li>D/D/D package is still a really good package to play in the deck, as a good extender to the combo, your time condition and a disruption tool</li><li>I decided to keep the list kinda classic and simple (the only spice comes from the side go 2nd options, due to Triple Tactics Thrust). For this reason, I didn't considered Transaction Rollback and Beatrice : you will be lock into Fiend too early IMO. Feel free to adapt the list if you want to test it</li><li>I play the list at 41 to dilute the bricks. Feel free to adapt the freespot to play at 40 if you want.

I was tired after playing through the early years of the game, and wanted something different. After convincing from some friends, I decided to finally return to paper YGO. I've played Traptrix on Master Duel (simply because they're a control deck that revolves on Trap Holes, some of my favorite old cards. The last deck I played was an Ordeal of the Travelever bounce deck, so the theme seemed to fit my style), and was looking to try them in an actual game. I was shocked to find out budget friendly the deck was, and decided to grab a few structure decks and other cards and craft a budget brew. So...here we are! I plan on taking this to a few locals and seeing how I hold up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Traptrix aren't a new deck, so it's pretty simple to explain: use the bug/plant girls alongside powerful traps to control your opponent and eat them. Sera is the foundation of the deck, as the main search tool that procs every time you do almost anything. Your main deck stuff has effects on Normal Summon, while Pudica &amp; Myrmeleo are strong removal pieces on Special Summon. The basic gameplan is to go first, then Summon Sera and hopefully Rafflesia. Then, just grind them to nothing and unleash the girls in a barrage of biological brutality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since the best staples cost hordes of money, I decided to try some more budget friendly options. Lost Wind is the poor people's Imperm, and C.E.D. is a funny way of getting past destruction protection. We splash in plenty of strong Trap Holes, but the best are Floodgate &amp; Gravediggers. I unfortunately felt immensely pressured to getting Ash &amp; Droll, and coughed up the necessary funds for it. Evenly comes with the Structure, and Phantom Knights trap is a 4th Holeutea if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The side deck is more Holes for certain matchups, and a mix of good staples (Kaiju, Solemn, Harpie's) with more main deck traps if certain ones do better in the matchup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me know if you have any advice, especially strong budget options! I'm still relearning the game, and probably am unaware of certain powerful cards!!</p>"

Give it to her, or face the dire consequences","<p>Nemleria is a deck that once I heard the general theme of, I knew I had to have it. Starring the adorable Dreaming Nemleria, this deck utilizes it's ability to banish it's Extra Deck face down to summon big stompy dream monsters and eventually use Nemleria to wipe the board to go for game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The star of the show allows us to fetch our Tower, which is our way to search out Reveil &amp; one of the other Beasts, and set up our Louve Trap to give is a non-targeting book of moon on a big cake monster!! We also bring Eater of Millions to empty our Extra Deck, bringing the Dream Tower crashing down and awakening the sleeping princess. Nemleria on Special Summon can banish 5 cards from field or grave at non-targeting level, so she pretty much clears the way for any of our threats to stampede on in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because we absolutely love banishing stuff, we also pack a nice little Gren Maju package. the Gizmek, Pots, and Dimension Shifter are great ways to add to our Gren Maju, who after an Eater/Nemleria combo can almost always clean up no problem. Our few staples are there to round out the strategy and help control our opponent for an win before we rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The only Extra Deck cards that could matter are the Charmers, Anima, and the Railgun. Most often however, we just let Nemleria nap on it until we use it as a resource, so you can literally put whatever in there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is a blend of control pieces and Kaijus. Summon Limit and our hand traps can bring plans to a screeching halt, while the Kaijus and Golem stop towers. Nibiru is fun for those darn Floo decks, and a great way to clear some crazy summoning combo board. The rest is just good staples for going second.</p>"

Instead, I opted to run it alongside the easiest level 3 engine I know, Neiroy the Traitor. He gets 2 free lvl 3s to start Xyzing. I know Dream Mirror needs a big package to operate, <strong>BUT,</strong>&nbsp;if you need more Goblin Bikers, you can probably barebones it by cutting Foe (since he doesn't summon), 1 Mara, 1 Sprite, 1-2 Hypnagogia, and possibly even 1 DM of Terror. Even if you don't see Hypnagogia, you at least need Terror in a field zone to get Oneiros the Tormentor's monster negate. Sprite can search any DM card from your deck, so the fusion spell at 1 is just fine.</p><p>After further examination, I realized Goblin Bikers are such a consistent engine that you only need 1 of each, including the search spell. You just have to play the archetype in reverse. All it takes is resolving both Neiroys' summons. You don't even need to use Traitor's second effect, but if you do, tribute Disciple to add Joy and ss Friend, who will resurrect Disciple. Xyz Big-Head Gabonga, which searches Dug, which searches Grand Entrance, which searches another Biker. <strong>THEN</strong> you Xyz Gold Pride Chariot Carrie with the 2 new Bikers. She's just net positive, and all it takes is 2 lvl 3s. Chariot gets you Better Luck Next Time, which gets you Captain Carrie, which gets you Neck and Neck, which returns a GP monster you control or card in your gy to your hand. Chariot will have 1 material left over for you to banish Grand Entrance to add back a Biker from the gy to your hand. During the end phase, you shuffle Chariot to draw 1 and attach a remaining Biker from the deck to Gabonga. Ultimate <strong>PROFIT.</strong></p><p>If you can't afford the minuscule GP package, use Fortune Tune instead. You can devote more of its material toward Bikers, and it recycles itself and Neiroys when leaving the field. I like Stampede as a second search target for Dug when resurrected. It lets you potentially Xyz monster negates like Ashura King and Tri-Edge Levia on your opponent's turn. You can also just use the 2 Biker quick effects to fuel Masquerena.</p><p>Crazy Beast and Grialle Trio aren't out yet, so they're in the side deck. Grand Meeting allows 2 GBs to become lvl 6, but I don't want to use that card until Crazy Beast comes out. The lackluster extra ns is not what Bikers need right now.</p>"

Let's see...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3mCdZRcgQU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place Librarian on Main Monster Zone (MMZ). Then, Synchro Summon ""Black-Winged Dragon"" by using Librarian + Shamisen as materials.</p><p>2) Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Kuriboh with it. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>3) Activate ""Clockwork Night"" and play ""Limiter Removal"" to raise the ATK of your monsters. Since they were converted into&nbsp;<strong>Machine</strong> by ""Clockwork Night"", it won't be a huge deal.</p><p>4) When the ATK of Saryuja is higher than your opponent's LP, give it to them with ""Shien's Spy"". If you go second and your opponent's side is full before all of that, use Ravenous and Baronne to make a room for Saryuja in the future.</p><p>5) Activate ""Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Curse"" combination. From now on, whenever you play a spell, you would take 1000 damage. However, ""Black-Winged Dragon"" covers you and converts the damage into Black Feather Counter (BFC).</p><p>6) Play a lot of spells until you have enough BFC. I personally played ""Primal Seed &gt;&gt;&gt; Reload"" loop repeatedly with an empty Main Deck but however you want to increase counters is up to you...</p><ul><li>For each BFC present on ""Black-Winged Dragon"", you can consume them by activating Black-Winged to reduce the ATK of your opponent's monster with respect to multiples of 700 and inflict the cut as damage to them.</li><li>If you don't want to deal with the math, assuming that you have played 3 x Upstart Goblin, Black-Winged should have 20 x BFC to deal 20 x 700 = 14000 damage in total. It's a bit more than the threshold but sound nice to round up. Otherwise, have a calculator ready, will you?</li></ul><p>7) Congratulations, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black-Winged Dragon"" can be collected by purchasing ""Blackwing's Pride"" deck. 30 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Limiter Removal"" can be found within ""Roid Nexus"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found either within ""The One Who Serve Ra"" or ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Packs to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! Also, as of this writing, you can find this card in Timed Pack called ""Name of Champions"". It is really a great pack for starters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Let's start with the older of the two, that being Phantom Knight. Phantom knight (or PK) has two unique gameplans in which it can execute: the first is its monster advantage from grave, and the second is its trap interaction plays. The monster advantage comes from the fact that all of the PK monsters have the ability to banish themselves to generate additional resources. This comes up most with certain key monsters; the likes of</span><a style=""text-decoration: none;"" href=""/card/?search=90432163"" rel=""nofollow""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</span></a><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">,</span><a style=""text-decoration: none;"" href=""/card/?search=36426778"" rel=""nofollow""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</span></a><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">, and</span><a style=""text-decoration: none;"" href=""/card/?search=63821877"" rel=""nofollow""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</span></a><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">, with one of their best starters being</span><a style=""text-decoration: none;"" href=""/card/?search=25538345"" rel=""nofollow""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</span></a><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> which can serve as a good starter for the deck.

All of the goblins have an effect that allows them to special summon themselves by detaching material from your XYZ, and most have an effect to either special summon another friend or add something to hand. Goblins don't have a definite starter, and as such aren't too good on their own, but once they get started they take off like a rocket.

Activate Armored Xyz and equip Grialle with Armor Fortress. Activate Grand Bash. Gabonga will have 1 material (Dark Knight Lancer) and Grialle will have 2 material (Dugg and Clutter), so Gabonga and Grialle can attack directly (must have 3 Xyz materials on field). 2700 (Gabonga) + 3100 (Grialle equipped Armor Fortress) + 2300 (Grialle second attack from Armored Xyz) = 8100.</p><p>The combo is easily interrupted but we have extenders like the level 3 psychics and Instant Fusion (thrust target). Thrust can also search for Grand Entrance and other board breaker one-ofs like Feather Duster, DRNM. The entire combo can be played under D-Fissure since Xyz material go to GY, so it serves as a pseudo-crossout for Droll/Veiler and is good against fire decks.</p>"

Poplar searches Original Sinful Spoils. Link Summon Linkuriboh using Poplar, and set Poplar in your Spell and Trap Zone. Use Ash's effect to Special Summon Snake-Eye Oak, and use Oak's effect to Special Summon back either Ash or Poplar. Then use Oak's effect using itself and Linkuriboh to Special Summon Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon from your deck. Here is where the combo line diverges.</p><p>Link Summon Artifact Dagda using Flamberge Dragon and the other Snake-Eye monster you have on the field, and use Flamberge Dragon's effect to summon back 2 of your Snake-Eye monsters. Use Original Sinful Spoils to send 1 of the Snake-Eye monster to the GY to Special Summon T.G. Rocket Salamander. Tribute Rocket Salamander to Special Summon T.G. Tank Grub, and set Artifact Scythe with Dagda's effect. Synchro Summon T.G. Mighty Striker using Tank Grub and the remaining Snake-Eye monster you have on the field, and search T.G. All Clear with Mighty Striker, and Special Summon a token with Tank Grub's effect. Activate All Clear and tribute the token to search T.G. Screw Serpent. Normal Summon Screw Serpent with All Clear's second Normal Summon and then summon back Rocket Salamander with Screw Serpent and summon back Tank Grub with Rocket Salamander. Synchro Summon Shamisen Samsara Sorrowcat using Rocket Salamander and Mighty Striker, sending T.G. Metal Skeleton from your Deck to the GY with Mighty Striker. Then Synchro Summon T.G. Star Guardian using Tank Scrub and Screw Serpent and use Star Guardian's effects to add Metal Skeleton back to your hand and then Special Summon it from your hand.</p><p>Then we return to the Promethean Princess line. Link Summon Promethean Princess using Dagda and Star Guardian. Special Summon Flamberge Dragon with Promethean Princess, and Link Summon Amblowhale using Promethean Princess and Sorrowcat. Use Sorrowcat's GY effect to return Star Guardian to your Extra Deck, and Special Summon it from your GY. Use Flamberge Dragon's effect to set Mighty Striker in your Spell and Trap Zone, and pass turn.</p><p>On your opponent's turn, Synchro Summon T.G. Wonder Magician using Sorrowcat and Metal Skeleton, banishing Sorrowcat. Then destroy your set Scythe with Wonder Magician, putting your opponent under the Scythe Lock, and Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur using Wonder Magician and Scythe. Use Flamberge's effect to summon Mighty Striker and Synchro Summon Bystial Dis Pater using Mighty Striker and Flamberge Dragon. Special Summon back Snake-Eye Ash and Poplar to search for the follow-up play. Your end board now is a Scythe Lock, Baronne de Fleur, Bystial Dis Pater, Amblowhale and Promethean Princess in your GY. If you have a second Baronne, you can make that instead as Baronne is not a HOPT.</p><p>If you are able to set an additional monster on the field, you can go for the Promethean Princess line earlier and also end with an IP Masquerena, and make Apollousa or Knightmare Unicorn on the opponent's turn. Where Arf Thou? can search an extender, but it can also search Droll &amp; Lockbird. If you have Where Arf Thou? in your hand and you get hit with Maxx C, you can search Droll to limit the draws your opponent gets.Is this the best way to play Snake-Eyes on MD, no, as it isn't a Nibiru proof combo line, but if you like to play a high risk high reward build, this is a deck for you.</p>"

This absolutely silly deck can utilize the rank 4 spam potential of Suships with a few intersting packages that might be enough to dazzle your opponent into defeat!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The core of the deck uses Shari and it's support monsters to summon spam your XYZ ships. Super-Dread is our ace in the ocean, while the regular Dread and Carrier gives us an annoying board prescene that can eventually whittle down your opponent. Typically, the field spell isn't used too often in these decks, but I believe it gives us enough advantage and Carrier's ability that it can actually matter. If we can only get the Dread and carrier and are going first, we can often go into Draco-Future to try and stop our opponent's schemes before they even begin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other engine we rely on is the tried and tested Adventure engine. Griffon &amp; Dracoback can really damper the opponent's board, and are shockingly easy to actually set up. We also run a small Kaiju engine as another way to break board, plus giant monsters fighting sushi battleships just sounds fun in theme. Small World can help us with consistency (and we have a variety of targets to go for) while everything else is just staples good stuff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The side board (as well as the Extra Deck) is just to help us fine tune to what we need. Unfortunately, Crow can't be bridged into via Small World, but we typically can take that package out for Ghost Belle to REALLY try to go after graveyards. The Ogre (as weird as it looks) can be fetched with Fenrir and also acts as another bridge for Small World if need be. The additional Kaiju cards are (again) to help create a board breaking package that eats through whatever summon spam we might be dealing with.</p>"

The main problem is the high weakness of the first actions (set up the two pendulum, if possible normal summon selettice to search invitare to use its 2nd effect).

Not only is there enhanced consistency with the Snake-Eye and Diabellestar cards, the power ceiling of RESCUE-ACE has dramatically increased as well, since the new additions to the deck allow it to link spam like no tomorrow! Powerful link bosses like Heatsoul, Amblowhale and Promethean Princess are easily made with a singular Snake-Eyes Ash, on top of your Turbulence's 4 set backrow!<br /></span></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;"">If you want to reach high levels on Masterduel ladder with a reliable deck that can either 1st or 2nd and can cram a ton of staples while being consistently powerful, Snake-Eyes Rescue-ACE is a good deck to invest in!&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-weight: 400;""><em>&nbsp;</em></span></div><p style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

A reduced RESCUE-ACE core is included because of the consistency boost the Snake-Eye cards give, and now they number 16 cards. 2 hydrant rather than 3 is used since the card can now be seached/summoned from deck with the Snake-Eye cards. 4 Rescue-ACE spells/traps are included as targets for Turbulence to set from deck. REINFORCE! isn't included since the card seems fairly inconsequential compared to the other quick-play spells and traps. One for One is included since it's an additional copy of any level 1 fire you need summoned from deck.&nbsp; <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the consistency boost from Snake-Eyes, a whopping 15 STAPLES is included in the strategy, including 14 handtraps (RESCUE-ACE Impulse is actually a handtrap!). This means you're always going to interrupt your opponent, no matter what turn it is! The usual ""Maxx C"" package is included so the pilot can win the Maxx C minigame. <br /></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Unlike earlier iterations of this deck, the Extra Deck is now used a lot since the Snake-Eye cards grant this deck immense link climb ability. Linkuriboh + Sunlight Wolf summon Heatsoul, I:P Masquera can be summoned from the backrow during your opponent's turn with Flamberge Dragon, etc. The Extra Deck is a toolbox for answers to specific game states. Since many monsters in the Extra Deck aren't required, they can be banish fodder for Pot of Prosperity.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; color: #d6d6d6;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Rescue-ACE functions as a control-centred midrange deck. Usually, the deck summons Turbulence, sets 4 spells/traps from the deck (two interruptions and two follow-up cards). Combined with the Snake-Eyes cards, this strategy has become much more aggressive since it is able to link climb quickly to Accesscode for an OTK. The hand also may have Rescue-ACE warriors that function as handtraps to net further advantage from deck, hand or GY.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Here is the deck's main combo:&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><em><span style=""letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">Snake-Eyes Ash + Rescue-ACE Turbulence/Extender = 4 set Rescue-ACE spells/traps (interruption and follow-up) + Promethean Princess in GY (monster destruction) + Amblowhale (link-monster summon and 1 card destruction) + Heatsoul (draw 2) + follow-up for next turn in hand</span></em></div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px;""><ol start=""1"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; list-style-type: '1.

Can potentially play around/through droll but is very prone to ash blossom and ghost belle. Side deck is ultimately your choice but droll and nib are strong at the moment. Tactics can be played if interrupted or if the opponent has a deck that plays a lot on your turn. Crossout is good for negating those ash blossoms stopping oviraptor/kaitoptera. Dharc and secret village can be played in tandem to stop your opponent from casting spells if they don't use spellcasters at all. Extra deck is mostly flexible, S:P is a great link 2 from linkuriboh to interrupt plays following if going first or a solid banish with a response on effects if going second. If you're in a winnable position you can opt for pentestag as well for the UCT book of moon into attacking all defense position monsters for piercing. We also do run super poly so having good super poly targets is important in the extra but if you don't want to run it, swap out the super poly targets too.</p>"

Then, this deck is for you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4i6TL59xiQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker. Meanwhile, send 2 x Barrage Blast to GY...</p><ul><li>If you set ""Barrage Blast"", Ravenous + Baronne can target them to destroy.</li><li>If you want to discard ""Barrage Blast"", Ravenous can gladly send both from your hand to GY.</li></ul><p>2) Play Saryuja &gt;&gt;&gt; Yajiro combo and place Yajiro at the center. Otherwise, Yajiro will detonate itself.</p><p>3) If your opponent's side is full, play ""Raigeki"" to clear them. Otherwise, play ""Shien's Spy"" and give Yajiro to your opponent. Place it to 1st column. Then, set ""Waking the Dragon"" to 2nd column.</p><p>4) Special Summon a monster to 2nd column, either with Panda or Shamisen. Yajiro will move to 2nd column and destroy everything within its sight.</p><p>5) Since ""Waking the Dragon"" has been destroyed thanks to Yajiro, you can Special Summon C9 on 2nd column. Next, play Astral Force to Special Summon ZEUS on 3rd column. There, Yajiro will jump onto 3rd column and destroy ZEUS.</p><p>6) Since we have sent 2 x Barrage Blast to GY beforehand and a Machine XYZ monster (ZEUS) was destroyed thanks to Yajiro, you can start blasting. Activate 2 x Barrage Blast cards by targeting C9 and ZEUS separately. There, ""Barrage Blast"" is going to banish C9 and ZEUS. Then, you will deal damage with respect to multiples of 200 of Machine XYZ monster's Rank.</p><p>7) 200 x 10 (C9) + 200 x 12 (ZEUS) = 2000 + 2400 = 4400 damage dealt, when your opponent had 3000 LP. Thus, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR! You can also try finding 2nd copy while ""Name of Champions"" Timed Pack is around. Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! Also, as of this writing, you can find it in ""Name of Champions"" Timed Pack. Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Mannadium Trisukta"" can be found within ""Indomitable Pride"" Timed Pack to save 30 SR! Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Barrage Blast"" can be found within ""Dreadnought Advance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Here, you have some options...<ul><li>Synchro Summon Librarian by using Necroface + Tuner as materials.</li><li>XYZ Summon Dugares by using Necroface + Cthugua as materials, rather than usual 2 x Cthugua.</li><li>Link Summon Saryuja by including one of its materials as Necroface.</li><li>Target Necroface on the field to destroy it. Either with Ravenous or Offerings can do it. (Seen in the video)</li></ul></li><li>If Necroface is in your hand, you can discard it. Either Dugares or Ravenous can do it.</li></ul><p>2) Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Black Luster Soldier by banishing Necroface + LIGHT to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Here, Necroface starts banishing 5 cards from Main Deck of both players, which should deplete your Main Deck.</p><p>3) If you have a Spellcaster monster in your Main Monster Zone (MMZ), play D.D.R and discard ""Fusion Parasite"" to Special Summon Parasite with D.D.R afterwards. Here, you can activate Parasite to Fusion Summon The Dark Magicians (TDM) by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials.</p><p>4) With your Main Deck being empty, play ""The Humble Sentry"" to shuffle back ""D.D. Dynamite"" into your Main Deck. There, you can activate TDM to draw it, which lets you activate Dynamite to start blasting.</p><p>5) Since the abilities of TDM and Dynamite aren't hard once per turn, it's time to repeat them. Destroy TDM with Offerings and fetch these combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"":</p><ul><li>The Humble Sentry</li><li>Offerings to the Doomed</li><li>D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation</li><li>D.D. Dynamite</li><li>Necroface</li></ul><p>6) Discard Necroface with D.D.R to revive TDM. There, Necroface starts fueling Dynamite. Next, repeat step #4. Then, step #5.</p><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #6 until game is over...</p><ul><li>Technically, you can also discard Necroface with D.D.R to revive Necroface and destroy Necroface with Offerings to fuel Dynamite faster. Therefore, playing TDM even once shall suffice. However you want to do is up to you, anyways. I'm here for guidance.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""D.D. Dynamite"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

They have massive synergy with the <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> archetype, which not only are also composed by Level 3 tuners and Level 5 and 8 monsters, but also pay life points to activate their effects, turning on the better Gold Pride effects, including their ability to freely Special Summon from the hand when your LP are lower than your opponent. Both archetypes can also summon monsters from the Extra Deck on the opponent's turn. Combining these 2 archetypes, along with some tech cards and handtraps, gives you a Rogue deck that is fun to play, decently powerful and capable to climbing to Master rank (with some grinding I was able to get to Master I).</p><p>With that said, here's a <strong>breakdown</strong> of the cards on the deck, and the ratios I feel are the best:</p><p><strong>The P.U.N.K. core:</strong> Most of them require paying LP to activate their effects. Allow for powerful synchro plays (and help with Xyz plays as well) and provide significant card advantage through their field spell draws.</p><ul><li><strong>Main Deck:</strong><ul><li><a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=19535693"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/19535693.jpg"" data-card=""19535693"" data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin</span></a> (x3) - A great starter for the deck, searches any P.U.N.K. monster by paying 600 LP. Usually you want Foxy Tune or Sharakusai, but might be useful to search other cards in niche situations. The good thing is that you pay 600 LP as cost, so even if the effect is negated you still turn on the Gold Pride abilities. Also, its GY effect to grant a P.U.N.K. monster 600 ATK can help you chain block in some situations and can be useful for OTKs or getting rid of large monsters as well.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=55920742"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/55920742.jpg"" data-card=""55920742"" data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune</span></a> (x3) - One of the best cards of the deck, a great starter and combo piece, allowing you to send it from the hand (or field) to the GY, along with another card from your hand, in order to Special Summon a P.U.N.K. from deck, except a Level 8. Notably, if the effect gets negated, you don't discard the 2nd card from your hand. Can get you to Ze Amin, Sharakusai or Deer Note. The 2nd effect to special summon itself from the hand by tributing a P.U.N.K. monster is also situationally useful for certain plays (when you're trying to get to a Psychic End Punisher fast for example). Also has a 3rd effect to gain LP when destroying monsters in battle, which is not really relevant except in extremelly grindy games (which you won't find easily with this deck).</li><li><a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=13258285"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/13258285.jpg"" data-card=""13258285"" data-name=""Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Sharakusai"">Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Sharakusai</span></a> (x1) - Fusion Summon the Rising Carp with its effect by using itself and another P.U.N.K. as material, and then the Rising Carp will get you 2 more P.U.N.K. monsters from the deck (usually Deer Note and Wa Gon / Ze Amin), allowing you to cycle through the names in your deck, use their effects and making your synchro plays possible. It's also part of many endboards, since combining it with a Lvl 8 (usually JAM Dragon Drive) allows you to Synchro Summon the Amazing Dragon on your opponent's turn to basically bounce all of their cards (+ draw 1 and possibly chainblock its effect if you have the field spell). This can be activated in any phase, including End Phase, so if your opponent is on a trap deck like Labrynth wait until they set everything, then bounce them all during the End Phase to basically win the duel instantly.</li><li><a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=50642380"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/50642380.jpg"" data-card=""50642380"" data-name=""Gagaku-P.U.N.K. Wa Gon"">Gagaku-P.U.N.K. Wa Gon</span></a> (x1) - It's another P.U.N.K. monster, Lvl 3 tuner that searches the field spell, and that's good enough. The effect to draw a card if your opponent targets a P.U.N.K. with an effect or for an attack can be useful sometimes but it's not something you care too much about.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=6609736"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/6609736.jpg"" data-card=""6609736"" data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note</span></a> (x1-2) - Level 5 monster, crucial to both your synchro plays (it and one of the Lvl 3 tuners gets you a Lvl 8 synchro, usually JAM Dragon Drive) and to pivot from P.U.N.K. to Gold Pride, allowing you to special summon another P.U.N.K. from the GY when itself goes from the field to the GY. I only play 1 copy since it doesn't feel amazing to draw (you want to summon it with Rising Carp or Foxy Tune), but you can play 2 if you want to make sure Runicks or Kashtiras don't ruin your day that easily, and also 2 would be better for the grind game, allowing you to go through your P.U.N.K. combos one more time if you need.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=81914447"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/81914447.jpg"" data-card=""81914447"" data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K.

Ogre Dance</span></a> (x1) - Good consistency card, discards itself to add a P.U.N.K. monster (except a Lvl 8) from deck to hand, usually Ze Amin, and also has the same effect as Foxy Tune to special summon itself from the hand by tributing a P.U.N.K. monster, which is useful if you need a large monster (notably, tributing a Ze Amin will trigger its effect and you can bump Ogre Dance to 3100 ATK). It also can get more attack when your opponent activates a monster effect, which is not very relevant most of the times. Not the best card in a format where Droll &amp; Lock Bird is one of the best handtraps, but still useful to have at least 1 copy.</li><li><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=49370016"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49370016.jpg"" data-card=""49370016"" data-name=""P.U.N.K.

Gives you insane advantage with its free draws and special summons, what more can you ask? Searchable of Wa Gon, so you only need to play 1 in this deck (if you were to play more copies in a different P.U.N.K. deck, remember that the special summon effect isn't even a hard once per turn!).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Extra Deck:</strong><ul><li><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=18313046"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/18313046.jpg"" data-card=""18313046"" data-name=""Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K.

Rising Carp</span></a> (x1) - Lvl 8 Fusion that you access of Sharakusai, that allows you to tribute itself to summon 2 P.U.N.K. monsters from the deck (when Fusion Summoned! does not have this ability if you revive it from the GY). The 2nd effect to give a P.U.N.K. monster 2 attacks during the battle phase comes up in OTK lines as well. Great card, but also a chokepoint of your P.U.N.K. combos, so sometimes you are able to skip it and go directly into JAM Dragon Drive with Deer Note + a Lvl 3 tuner</li><li><a class=""type-synchro-monster"" href=""/card/?search=28403802"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28403802.jpg"" data-card=""28403802"" data-name=""P.U.N.K.

Essential card in your combos, as it can provide you with another Lvl 3 body, or just search a hand trap (Ghost Ogre). Also has another effect to revive itself from the GY when your opponent responds to a P.U.N.K. effect, which is kinda useful, especially if you're trying to OTK through an opponent's board and they try to do something in response to Amazing Dragon. Just remember you need a Psychic tuner to summon it!</li><li><a class=""type-synchro-monster"" href=""/card/?search=44708154"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/44708154.jpg"" data-card=""44708154"" data-name=""Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon"">Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon</span></a> (x1) - One of my favourite monsters, and the ace card of the P.U.N.K. archetype! Generic Lvl 11 synchro, that bounces cards your opponent controls, up to the number of different Lvl 3 Psychic monsters in your GY (if you go through the P.U.N.K. combo you should have 3-4 names in GY). Since you can Synchro Summon during the opponent's turn with Sharakusai, this effect is useful both going 1st and 2nd! Also has another very useful effect to revive any P.U.N.K. monster from your GY, but you cannot use both effects in the same turn, so if you are summoning it on your turn, choose carefully!</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Gold Pride core: </strong>All of the Gold Pride monsters have the ability to special summon themselves from the hand when you have less LP than your opponent, then each one of them has special effects and extra deck forms. The extra deck monsters have strong effects but return to the Extra Deck (and re-summon their Main deck counterparts) during the End Phase if they use them.</p><ul><li><strong>Main Deck:</strong><ul><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=96305350"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/96305350.jpg"" data-card=""96305350"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Captain Carrie"">Gold Pride - Captain Carrie</span></a> (x2-3) - Level 3 monster, searches a Gold Pride trap card (Start Your Engines) on summon. Also has an effect when it goes to GY to banish up to 3 Gold Pride cards from the GY and increase the attack of a Gold Pride extra deck monster by 500 for each, and banishing 1-2 cards can be useful in some OTK lines, or even just to chain block something if needed.

Also allows you to Synchro Summon during your opponent turn, by using Gold Pride monsters as material - unlike Sharakusai, you can summon generic synchro monsters (like Dragite to avoid Evenly Matched, maybe even the P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon if you don't have Sharakusai, or PEP if you're desperate), but you will also often go for its Extra Deck form, Star Leon, which can pop an opponent's monster if you have less LP. You should play 3 copies, but I only had 2 copies (due to bad UR luck on my pulls) and it was ok, so if you are low on crafting materials it's possible to play with 2.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=92003832"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92003832.jpg"" data-card=""92003832"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Roller Baller"">Gold Pride - Roller Baller</span></a> (x1-2) - Level 5 monster, allows you to access the Gold Pride Fusion Monster, Pin Baller, as a quick effect, to basically ""Relinquish"" your opponent board away! Useful both going 1st and 2nd, and sometimes it can also be used just as a free Level 5 body to use on your Synchro plays (if you have access to Leon later in the turn you will end up with it on the board anyway!), so you can play 2 and not feel bad when you draw it.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59900655"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59900655.jpg"" data-card=""59900655"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Nytro Head"">Gold Pride - Nytro Head</span></a> (x1) - Level 8 monster, which can summon a token to your opponent's field (that can't be used as link material) during their standby phase, and then as a quick effect destroy that token and all cards in its adjacent zones. Of course your opponent can play around it, but it has some neat applications: stops the Kashtira special summons, turns off some board breakers like Evenly Matched or Lightning Storm, you can put the token under an extra monster zone if you occupy the other to force your opponent to place their links where you can pop them, or maybe even put it next to a pendulum zone if you know that you are against a Pendulum deck. Also a big free Special Summon for OTKs or Synchro/Xyz plays. I like to have it at 1 copy.</li><li><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=54670997"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/54670997.jpg"" data-card=""54670997"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Better Luck Next Time!"">Gold Pride - Better Luck Next Time!</span></a> (x2) - The Gold Pride starter, a Continuous Spell that searches any Gold Pride monster by losing LP equal to its ATK (turning on their effects), and also gives you draws when your extra deck Gold Pride monsters return to the deck, which usually happens during the end phase. It's not bad to draw, but it's also searchable by Chariot Carrie, so 2 copies feel perfect in this deck.</li><li><a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=21677871"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/21677871.jpg"" data-card=""21677871"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Start Your Engines!"">Gold Pride - Start Your Engines!</span></a> (x1-2) - Excelent trap card, searchable of Carrie, allowing you to destroy an opponent's monster on summon and summon a Gold Pride from the deck (it has some randomness, but if you reveal Leon/Roller Baller you'll have a useful effect no matter what). Can be negated by Ash Blossom though, so I don't like relying on it, but it is very powerful to resolve. I don't like drawing it though, especially going 2nd, so I only play 1 copy, but 2 copies can help on the grind game. Also you need at least 3 Gold Pride monsters in deck to resolve it, so be careful if you don't have many in deck, or if you activate Maxx C!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Extra Deck:</strong><ul><li><a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=65892585"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65892585.jpg"" data-card=""65892585"" data-name=""Gold Pride - Chariot Carrie"">Gold Pride - Chariot Carrie</span></a> (x1) - Extra Deck form of Captain Carrie, Rank 3 Xyz that allows you to detach a material to add a Gold Pride spell (Better Luck Next Time), also allowing you to send a Gold Pride monster from deck to GY if you have less LP, very useful if you want to search Leon and revive Roller Baller for instance. It's the card that links P.U.N.K. and Gold Pride - After doing your P.U.N.K. combos you can easily have 2 Lvl 3 monsters on the field, and overlaying for Chariot Carrie kicks off your Gold Pride combos. If you are going second and don't OTK you can also overlay Zeus on top of it.

It has a very useful ""Relinquished-like"" effect, equiping to itself monsters your opponent controls up to the number of fusion materials used (does not target!), and cannot be negated if you are behind on LP! However, your opponent can still interact with it in other ways, so if they respond with something that removes it from the field, it resolves without effect.

We have a few options: you can go for Chariot Carrie and immediately start the Gold Pride plays (but you don't get to send from deck to GY since you don't have less LP), Fortune Tune for a Zeus play when going 2nd, or Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to protect your other plays from handtraps like Nibiru. Even Taketomborg is not the worst to draw, since it's a free special summon if you have another wind monster like Leon. Unfortunately this also plays into Droll, since Terrortop searches for Taketomborg, but it was still very important in my climb to Master I so I recommend it.</li><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=8736823"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/8736823.jpg"" data-card=""8736823"" data-name=""Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan"">Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan</span></a> (x1) - Part of your combos, it's a great card to send to the GY with JAM Dragon Drive (which works under Droll unlike other extenders like Psychic Tracker/Wheeleder!) or discard with Foxy Tune if you happen to draw it, since it later revives itself when you summon a Lvl 3 monster (it gets banished if it leaves the field but you can even get around that if you Xyz into Carrie with it).

Gives you a chance against Stun and Runick decks, also useful going first against any deck that uses Field/Continuous spells (like Kashtira or Mannadium) or Pendulum monsters (like Superheavy). On top of it all, it's can also function as a starter going 2nd, since you pay 1000 LP! I like playing 2, but play whatever amount you feel like it, depending on how much you hate Stun decks.</li><li><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=67723438"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/67723438.jpg"" data-card=""67723438"" data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</span></a> (x2) - One of the best cards we get to play, gets full combo without using the normal summon, or gets an extender, can get Sharakusai or Ghost Ogre on the opponent's turn if you don't have another choice, etc. It's semi-limited at the moment but play 3 if it ever gets unlimited.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Handtraps: </strong>These can be adjusted depending on the format and your preferences, but right now this is what I'm playing</p><ul><li style=""list-style-type: none;""><ul><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=23434538"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/23434538.jpg"" data-card=""23434538"" data-name=""Maxx"">Maxx ""C""</span></a> (x3) + <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a> (x2-3) + <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=24224830"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24224830.jpg"" data-card=""24224830"" data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</span></a> (x2) - Unfortunately we have to play the minigame.

Many times you can bait out a handtrap like Ash, Maxx C or Droll when using cards like Emergency Teleport, Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance, Better Luck Next Time, etc. and then drop Gamma to protect against that handtrap and also make a Baronne de Fleur (you can synchro Gamma and Driver into Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon, revive the Gamma and make a Lvl 10 synchro). Also protects your Rising Carp, since it tributes itself for cost, leaving an empty field ready for Gamma to make an appearance should your opponent try to Ash your chokepoint. If that wasn't enough, it is a Lvl 2 tuner you can Special Summon with Emergency Teleport, making it easy to summon a Baronne de Fleur if you have an extra Emergency Teleport you didn't need (and aren't yet under the Nyannyan lock!)</li><li><a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59438930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59438930.jpg"" data-card=""59438930"" data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</span></a> (x1) - Searchable with JAM Dragon Drive, also summonable with Emergency Teleport during your opponent's turn if you have nothing better to do with it (it's a Lvl 3 Psychic so in the GY it counts for the Amazing Dragon bounces).

Masterduel has the deck at full power yet i rarely run into other SPYRAL pilots. The main focus of the deck so far is discarding SPYRAL cards for cost in the Purrely Engine and in turn enabling SPYRAL plays from the GY. So far in testing the combos feel very satisfying but the timer is your worst enemy. This is a work in progress and i will be updating it as i get to playtest. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Igknight Reloaded+Wattfox+Wanghu+Morphing Jar #2,"<p>Hello, how is it going? In this deck, we will mill the opponent with ""Morphing Jar"" without milling ourselves, all thanks to ""Igknight Reloaded"". If you have checked <a href=""/deck/hiro-s-shadow-mill-410039"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>this</strong></a> deck, it's exactly the same but with the addition of a Pendulum Monster and ""Igknight Reloaded"" to disregard any drawback ""Morphing Jar"" can cause to you. Let's get started!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID05bemhkIo"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place Ravenous on Main Monster Zone (MMZ). Then, Link Summon Saryuja when you have 4 cards in your Main Deck (MD) and shuffle back 3, all of which has to be spells including Deep-Seated. Then, Special Summon Morphing Jar (MJ) with Saryuja but only if you have up to 3 x MD monsters, including MJ.</p><p>2) If your opponent's side is full, use ""Raigeki"" to make room for MJ #2 + Wanghu. Next, make sure you have MJ #2 + Wanghu + Wattfox + Pendulum Monster in your hand. Then, set ""Igknight Reloaded"" besides all Traps and end your turn.</p><p>3) Before letting your opponent go, discard MJ #2 + Wanghu + Wattfox. During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these cards in order explained below:</p><ol><li>Igknight Reloaded</li><li>Ravenous &gt;&gt;&gt; Discard Pendulum + Any &gt;&gt;&gt; Target anything but MJ and your backrow</li><li>Powerful Rebirth &gt;&gt;&gt; Wattfox</li><li>Reverse Reuse &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ #2 as face-down</li><li>Give and Take &gt;&gt;&gt; Wanghu</li><li>All-Out Attacks</li></ol><p>4) Here is what is going on...</p><ul><li>In the first two actions, ""Igknight Reloaded"" has been activated to not let you draw any cards via MJ. Even though you couldn't reveal Pendulum Monster in your hand to shuffle it and draw cards due to Ravenous, game considers ""Igknight Reloaded"" as perfectly resolved. In addition, as mentioned in #1, you shouldn't risk shuffling any Main Deck monster into your Main Deck anyways. Nor you want Deep-Seated to be drawn, which somehow enables you to use MJ #2 and All-Out Attacks loop forever. Thus, discarding Pendulum Monster with Ravenous is a must and you don't have to use Monkeyboard. I picked it for showcasing my entertainer side :D</li><li>As for the rest; Wanghu destroys Wattfox, which shuts down anything your opponent can try to break you, including hand-traps. Then, via All-Out Attacks, MJ #2 will flip face-up and you can start milling your opponent.</li></ul><p>5) After everything is done in #4, MJ #2 is going to excavate three monsters, which are MJ #2 + MJ + Wanghu. Should it come to that, place these monsters in order below to not destroy first two with Wanghu by accident and know that if you have two more Main Deck monsters, place them as last:</p><ol><li>MJ #2</li><li>MJ</li><li>Wanghu</li></ol><p>6) Now, rather than both players drawing 5 cards via MJ, only your opponent can thanks to ""Igknight Reloaded"". So, repeat what was explained in #5 until your opponent is out of cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- Don't spend any materials on ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" if you don't have to save 30 UR! Any Pendulum Monster can do the trick.</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""King Tiger Wanghu"" + ""All-Out Attacks"" + ""Morphing Jar"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Not gonna lie, watching Ecclessia lay her eyes on Ablaz for the first time in animated form combined with the ""Passionate Duelist"" music in the background put tears in my eyes. (T____T) I look forward to the day Konami truly makes the ""Abyss"" storyline anime. Until then, I can just play the deck and create strategy guides to play out my fusion fantasies!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Fangirling aside, I truly believe that the TCG meta right now is a favourable environment for Branded to flourish in. The most common forms of interruption center around various destruction effects (for ex. Fire Kings) or banishment (for ex. S:P Little Knight) and both are interactions that Branded can easily brush off due to how the strategy functions.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Ash Blossom, the nemesis of Branded is actually experiencing a decline in usage since its hardly effects vs. decks popular in the meta right now. Hiita can also revive Ash Blossom from grave to link climb into the ever popular Promethean Princess, adding further reason to stop using the popular handtrap. Devastating staples made common by the February 2024 meta like Droll &amp; Lockbird, Dimension Shifter, Nibiru and Soul Release hardly affect Branded's gameplan and the deck can usually confidently still create a full board despite their use!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The strongest meta decks like Fire Kings and Diabellestarr also suffer greatly from Branded's forms of removal such as Mirrorjade's non-targeting banish and Albaz/Superpoly's use of monsters material on field. This deck also features the Shaddoll package in the side deck for going second (courtesy of Yacine656 for this package) which is additional Fire King hate! Branded also has a good match-up against the new up-and-coming meta contender, Voiceless Voice, since its interruptions hardly affect the strategy (except it's one omni-negate).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Best of all, the Branded strategy is competitive despite being relatively cheap this format, since it doesn't require the Sinful Spoils Engine, Bonfires or S:P Little Knight!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded has also been nearly untouched by banlists and it remains basically at full power in the TCG!

Due to the current meta, I've also added back the <strong>FRIGHTFUR, SUPERPOLY and NADIR SERVANT </strong>packages.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>BYSTIAL </strong>package is relatively small, since banishing light/dark monsters in the GY isn't very impactful and common in today's fire-dominated metagame. Lubellion is ""searchable"" from deck since Branded Fusion dumps him to the GY, and Lubellion can summon itself from the GY by tributing the on-field Albion. Lubellion can place from deck <strong>Branded Lost</strong>&nbsp;as extra protection/search power or <strong>Branded Regained </strong>for more advantage generation.</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>SUPERPOLY </strong>has been re-added back to the vulnerability of most meta decks to the card. For example, Mannadium boards can be broken by making Muddy Mudragon by fusing away Apollousa and Baronne. Fire King boards can be broken by fusing away Amblowhale and another of their fire monsters.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>NADIR SERVANT</strong>&nbsp;is an excellent and multi-purpose extender to Branded, since it singlehandidly sets up Quem + Albaz on the field and GY. It can also dump a missing combo piece to the GY to fulfill particular goals, like dumping Rindbrumm (so Albaz can be summoned from GY during opponent's turn) or Albion (so it can set a Branded card from deck). Also, if Branded Fusion gets negated, Nadir Servant still sets up a strong gamestate by itself.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>FUSION DEPLOYMENT</strong>&nbsp;also functions as a toolbox in this deck, since its 2 targets each serve a distinct function. <strong>Albaz </strong>can breakboards when summoned, and Albaz + Super Poly cracks most boards nowadays. If your opponent happens to field Dragon monsters, Albaz can contact fuse them away. <strong>Cartesia </strong>enables fusion summoning as a quick effect. Not only does she give access to Granguinol (which is a foolish burial), she can protect your activating monster effects on the field from targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>TRIPLE TACTICS THRUST</strong>&nbsp;is an incredible card in a Branded deck, since it can indirectly search you any normal spell/trap if your opponent dares to activate a monster effect during your turn, even Branded Fusion! Going first, this card can set Fusion Duplication, which can copy any normal/quick-play fusion spell from the GY from the GY like Branded Fusion and Super Poly! So say you get Ash'd on Branded Fusion, you can activate Triple Tactics Thrust to set Fusion Duplication from deck and full fusion combo during your opponent's&nbsp; Draw Phase!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>50 CARDS</strong>&nbsp;are utilized in this deck rather than around 40ish since every important piece (esp. Branded Fusion) is highly searchable anyways. 50 cards also reduces the likelihood of drawing garnets and bricks.</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>SIDEDECK </strong>is chock full of potent boardbreakers when you are forced to go second - Shaddoll Fusion (explained below), Cosmic Cyclone (to kill Fire King Island) and Evenly Matched (searchable with Thrust). The cards to sideout in this deck are the Bystial cards when you aren't facing a dedicated light/dark deck, or 1 copy of Mercourier, Cartesia, and Quem. When forced to go second, you can also side out Fusion Duplication and Branded Regained. Different Dimension Ground and Eradicator Epidemic Virus are turn ending going-first targets for Triple Tactics Thrust. Branded Etude is an excellent searchable floodgate that banishes your opponent's material for summons, hardcountering common meta strategies like Fire Kings, Sinful Spoils and Voiceless Voice.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>SHADDOLL </strong>package is in the sidedeck specifically to counter Fire King Sinful Spoils (although the . This package is especially potent going second. Shaddoll Fusion will send from deck to GY Naelshaddoll Ariel and Shaddoll Dragon to summon Shaddoll Apkallone. This will simultaneously banish 3 cards from your opponent's GY(Ariel's eff), destroy 1 spell/trap (Dragon's eff), and negate a card on the field (Apkallone's eff). 3 chainblocked interactions with 1 Shaddoll Fusion makes for a potent boardbreaker!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>SUPER POLYMERIZATION</strong>&nbsp;is extremely effective this format. Boards are easily crackable with Super Poly's non-targeting, non-destroying removal, eviserating decks like Fire Kings, Voiceless Voice and other Branded variants. The Extra Deck has Garura and Mudragon as it's targets. The Extra Deck is tight, but Earth Golem @Ignister can be slotted in to out the usual Fire King board of I:P Masquerena and Amblowhale/Promethean Princess.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This is my ""Gas"" Branded is designed to play through your opponent's interruption to create gigantic fusion beatsticks and overwhelm with high ATK and massive resource generation. If given even a second of breathing space, your opponent will find that they are facing down a field full of powerful fusion monsters!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded Fusion is both a blessing and a curse for this strategy. The whole deck revolves around searching and resolving that card, and if it's negated, your further options are likely limited. Your obvious glaring chokepoint and weakness is Branded Fusion, so it is imperative that you can bait out the Ash Blossom or other forms of interruption before you activate this card. It is advisable to use every other card first like &nbsp;Branded Opening or Lubellion so that you can bait out your opponent's interruption (but be careful of Droll). Also, from experience playing the deck, I've discovered that people intentionally hold their Ash Blossom saving it for Branded Fusion - so if you don't have the card, you can bluff having it and just do all your searches/summons from deck!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">End boards are very hand dependant and can vary greatly, but here are the mainline combos:</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Branded Fusion + Dark Monster + Discard = Mirrorjade (banish), Bystial Lubellion + Branded Continous Spell (resources), Set Branded Card (Branded in Red, Banishment, Retribution, Opening)</em></span></div><ol style=""list-style-type: decimal;"" start=""1""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, sending Albaz + Bystial Lubellion from deck.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Fusion summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon by fusing Albaz + Dark Monster with Albion.

Depending on the hand, your opponent may also be dealing with Mercourier's monster negate, bystial's GY banish, Masquerade's -600 burn, and Granguinol can summon Luluwalilith from the Extra Deck. If you're lucky, you also have a facedown Super Polymerization - a devasting turn ending card if used at the right time. Your hand will likely also be sizeable and ready with follow-up for next turn since Cartesia, Titaniklad and Albion generate resources during Branded's ""main phase 3"" - the End Phase.</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, Branded can slog through interruption, pierce through boards and beat down your opponent's monsters with big beatsticks. Branded is naturally equipped with in-engine ways to play going second. Polymerization fusing into Guardian Chimera is a nigh-unstoppable juggernaut since it's effect is often chainblocked with the fusion material used for it's fusion summon and it is untargetable since you used Polymerization. If Branded Opening is in the GY, it also can't be destroyed! Super Polymerization can fuse away many boards in today's meta, especially with Garura, only needing 2 monsters with the same type and attribute. Muddy Mudragon can fuse away your Fire King's opponent's Amblowhale + Fire Monster as well! Alot of interruption these days involve destroying and banishing (For example, Fire King and Labrynth does this alot) - Branded is very comfortable with all those interruptions and it usually shrugs them off.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">While being able to play through the ""Tier 1 Fire"" meta, Branded can also compete easily vs. the ""anti-meta"" strategies that hardcounter the tier 0 fire decks. The strategies that love to lockout the GY like Kashtira, Exosister and Floowandereeze are all good matchups for Branded. Dimension Shifter, Nibiru and Droll &amp; Lockbird are all high impact handtraps that Albaz and friends can comfortably play through with most hands!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><p style=""text-align: center; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p><ul style=""list-style-type: disc;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Due to the relevance of Droll &amp; Lockbird this format, try to search for Branded Fusion first before anything else. Once they Droll you after you get this crucial playstarter, the lingering search floodgate hardly affects the Branded strategy since everything else summons or sets directly from the maindeck.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Branded lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Be sure to side in the ample amounts of backrow hate in these match-ups!&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The best cards to side out is the Bystial and Edge Imp package, especially when the match-ups doesn't call for them. Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out.</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If Branded Lost is active, Fusion effect's activation cannot be negated. Cards that negate the activation like Baronne De Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon and even Solemn Judgment cannot negate your Branded Fusion! Branded Lost is a perfect way to bait a negate or to guarantee your Fusion effect when you're against these threats.</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you feel like it's a good meta call, play Dragoon in Branded! Include Dark Magician/The Light-Hex Sealed Fusion and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in your deck for an indestructible and untargetable powerhouse!</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Some decks immediately die to Branded Etude since it's a ""macro-cosmos"" for Extra Deck summons. In particular, Fire King/Diabellestarr variants flop to this searchable floodgate. Many rogue decks also are crippled by Etude like Voiceless Voice, Chimera and Spright.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Instant Fusion can summon either Millenium-Eyes Restrict (self-explanatory) or Mudragon of the Swamp. Mudragon of the Swamp lowkey hardcounters Fire Kings strategies, since calling ""fire"" with Mudragon makes it impossible for your opponent's monsters to target themselves - rendering the deck nigh unplayable! For example, Kirin and Promethean Princess wouldn't be able to activate!&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

About 4 years after the ""Abyss"" storyline debuted in ""Rise of the Duelist,"" Konami actually COOKED and delivered the Branded cards as an anime. Seeing my favourite cards in animated form really re-ignited my love for certain decks, especially the Branded cards! It's been a while since I've made a proper TCG guide on Albaz and friends, so I decided it's about time to update my favourite fusion strategy with an up-to-date strategy guide.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Believe me, Branded is poised well to take the ""fire meta"" by storm.
