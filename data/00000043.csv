The decks biggest strenght is its consistency, with how many 1 card combos and free extenders the deck has makes it so it doesnt brick very often and even if it does there still a high chance that you'll still get some form of interruption up. 2. The decks flexibility makes it so it can be played in alot of differnt ways ways adding in a gold pride engine to use alongside the P.u.n.k cards and with Grand Bash lets the deck use almost any XYZ monster as long as you play other goblin cards for example by using a card like goblin zombie you gain acces to both rank 4 and 7 XYZ monster while&nbsp; goblin zombie also has the abillity to search any of Goblin Riders when its sent from the field to the grave.</p><p>Now for the decks weaknesses 1. the deck can have a pretty hard time going 2nd against a lot of the stronger deck even though the the deck can usally play through 1 or 2 distruptions going 2nd but with some hands it can struggle. 2. this deck is another basic combo deck that just looses hard to droll and nibiru but with nib its still possible to get gossip shadow out before they can activate it but with droll if you dont open called by it can just end your turn a lot of the time.</p><p>now for as the last thing i'll go over 2 1 card combosthe first is for Terrortop and Ze Amin and 1 for Tour Guide, even though they end on the same board the Tour Guide one still uses a few less resources and gives you more to work with.</p><p>One Card Ze Amin replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134861</p><p>if you openend Terrortop or Ze amin, make Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect to special itself, Dugg effect to add Grand Entrance, use the 1st effect of Grand Entrance to add Mean Merciless and the 2nd to special it, overlay Dugg and mean into Alucard then overlay it into Angel of mischief, Angel effect detaching Alucard&nbsp; to add ghostrick shot, shot effect to revive Alucard once again overlay Alucard into Angel, both Angels overlay to make F0 into UFD, use Grand Entrance 3rd effect to detach a xyz material and add Dugg back to hand the use Means grave effect to revive itself by detaching a xyz materiel and on summon special Dugg overlay them for Armor Torpedo then activating its effect to draw 2 then overlaying for Armor Fortress then Fortress effect to add Full Armored XYZ.</p><p>the Tour Guide version of this combo is a little bit different</p><p>One Card Tour Guide Replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134739</p><p>Summon Tour Guide, Tour Guide effect summon Rhino Warrior, overlay for Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect detaching Rhino Warrior, CL1 Dugg CL2 Rhino Warrior, Rhino Warrior dumps Mean merciless, Dugg adds Grand Entrance, Grand Enctrance adds and specials Clatter Sploder, Clatter effect to summon Mean from grave overlay Clatter and mean for alucard to do the UFD line, then use Means grave effect to summon itself, use it and Dugg to over lay into Armor torpede and do the Full armor line</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It can however be modified to make negates such as through Firewall.</p><p>The main field you want to end with is wiccid in one of the extra monster zones with invalid dolmen directly underneath and accelerator to the right of dolmen. This creates a lock that makes your monsters unaffected by other monster effects, your monsters cant be destroyed by card effects and your opponent must battle dolmen who with the help of accelerator can get to 4800 attack. Accelerator can be switch out for honeybot, it just depends on how many monsters you can bring out.</p><p>When going first I suggest just putting in as many cyberse monsters who can special summon themselves to prevent a much damage from nibiru. If your opponent is playing nibiru every game, sub in the firewall package or better cyberse link monsters to end in a substantially sized Arrival Cyberse (its better than nothing).&nbsp;</p><p>When going second, I suggest subbing in dark ruler, droll and evenly (anything to prevent interuptions). When subbing I take out 1x Reborn, 1x f.a.ighting spirit, 2x parallel exceed, 2x upstart goblin, 1x meet you and 1x mathmech addition.</p><p>I wanted to make a mostly pure @ignister deck, it is by no means perfect but it will definitely give some decks a challenge. It is pretty fun to use in a semi competitive setting. If you have any ideas to make this deck better please comment.</p>"

Darling it's better dow- Oh you dead.,"<p>And here is the Sea Serpent-flavored White Fish deck I promised you. I replaced most of the ice themes with deeper waters (Ran Aegirine is still a free Gymir). Honestly, this is probably the weaker and less consistent version of the two, but I love and am equally committed to all of these engines. I even sided a tiny Mermail package. I didn't want the deck to go over 40 since you want to see Diva more than anything, but maybe you could take out one Heavy Infantry and something else. The idea on that is to add Abyssteus to hand with Abyssalacia so you don't have to waste Abyssdine's summon on your opponent's turn. But I digress.</p><p>Summoning Guitar Gurnards Duonigis, hands-down the coolest Sea Serpent, with Diva gets you level 7 or 8 synchros. With all your free summons, it just snowballs from there. Atlanteans do Atlantean things to hand-loop; DS Minstrel is an anti-handtrap; and the other Deep Seas are extenders when discarded/ss'd. Chengying might be a better pick than Bihamut, who just starts with higher attack. I wanted a big beatstick to contend with ""unaffected"" monsters. Duonigis does give an attack buff from the gy.</p><p>Sadly, we are only getting 1 Toad off of Bahamut Shark with this deck. The only level 2 Aqua that would fit with this deck is Swap Frog, and trying to field 2 of him is just too hard. Plus I don't wanna pay his tax when I could still run Ran instead. Boy I'm looking forward to these water cards. I hope they're not expensive.</p>"
