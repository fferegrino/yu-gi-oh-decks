The decks biggest strenght is its consistency, with how many 1 card combos and free extenders the deck has makes it so it doesnt brick very often and even if it does there still a high chance that you'll still get some form of interruption up. 2. The decks flexibility makes it so it can be played in alot of differnt ways ways adding in a gold pride engine to use alongside the P.u.n.k cards and with Grand Bash lets the deck use almost any XYZ monster as long as you play other goblin cards for example by using a card like goblin zombie you gain acces to both rank 4 and 7 XYZ monster while&nbsp; goblin zombie also has the abillity to search any of Goblin Riders when its sent from the field to the grave.</p><p>Now for the decks weaknesses 1. the deck can have a pretty hard time going 2nd against a lot of the stronger deck even though the the deck can usally play through 1 or 2 distruptions going 2nd but with some hands it can struggle. 2. this deck is another basic combo deck that just looses hard to droll and nibiru but with nib its still possible to get gossip shadow out before they can activate it but with droll if you dont open called by it can just end your turn a lot of the time.</p><p>now for as the last thing i'll go over 2 1 card combosthe first is for Terrortop and Ze Amin and 1 for Tour Guide, even though they end on the same board the Tour Guide one still uses a few less resources and gives you more to work with.</p><p>One Card Ze Amin replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134861</p><p>if you openend Terrortop or Ze amin, make Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect to special itself, Dugg effect to add Grand Entrance, use the 1st effect of Grand Entrance to add Mean Merciless and the 2nd to special it, overlay Dugg and mean into Alucard then overlay it into Angel of mischief, Angel effect detaching Alucard&nbsp; to add ghostrick shot, shot effect to revive Alucard once again overlay Alucard into Angel, both Angels overlay to make F0 into UFD, use Grand Entrance 3rd effect to detach a xyz material and add Dugg back to hand the use Means grave effect to revive itself by detaching a xyz materiel and on summon special Dugg overlay them for Armor Torpedo then activating its effect to draw 2 then overlaying for Armor Fortress then Fortress effect to add Full Armored XYZ.</p><p>the Tour Guide version of this combo is a little bit different</p><p>One Card Tour Guide Replay https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=851484-57134739</p><p>Summon Tour Guide, Tour Guide effect summon Rhino Warrior, overlay for Gabonga add Dugg, Dugg effect detaching Rhino Warrior, CL1 Dugg CL2 Rhino Warrior, Rhino Warrior dumps Mean merciless, Dugg adds Grand Entrance, Grand Enctrance adds and specials Clatter Sploder, Clatter effect to summon Mean from grave overlay Clatter and mean for alucard to do the UFD line, then use Means grave effect to summon itself, use it and Dugg to over lay into Armor torpede and do the Full armor line</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It can however be modified to make negates such as through Firewall.</p><p>The main field you want to end with is wiccid in one of the extra monster zones with invalid dolmen directly underneath and accelerator to the right of dolmen. This creates a lock that makes your monsters unaffected by other monster effects, your monsters cant be destroyed by card effects and your opponent must battle dolmen who with the help of accelerator can get to 4800 attack. Accelerator can be switch out for honeybot, it just depends on how many monsters you can bring out.</p><p>When going first I suggest just putting in as many cyberse monsters who can special summon themselves to prevent a much damage from nibiru. If your opponent is playing nibiru every game, sub in the firewall package or better cyberse link monsters to end in a substantially sized Arrival Cyberse (its better than nothing).&nbsp;</p><p>When going second, I suggest subbing in dark ruler, droll and evenly (anything to prevent interuptions). When subbing I take out 1x Reborn, 1x f.a.ighting spirit, 2x parallel exceed, 2x upstart goblin, 1x meet you and 1x mathmech addition.</p><p>I wanted to make a mostly pure @ignister deck, it is by no means perfect but it will definitely give some decks a challenge. It is pretty fun to use in a semi competitive setting. If you have any ideas to make this deck better please comment.</p>"

Darling it's better dow- Oh you dead.,"<p>And here is the Sea Serpent-flavored White Fish deck I promised you. I replaced most of the ice themes with deeper waters (Ran Aegirine is still a free Gymir). Honestly, this is probably the weaker and less consistent version of the two, but I love and am equally committed to all of these engines. I even sided a tiny Mermail package. I didn't want the deck to go over 40 since you want to see Diva more than anything, but maybe you could take out one Heavy Infantry and something else. The idea on that is to add Abyssteus to hand with Abyssalacia so you don't have to waste Abyssdine's summon on your opponent's turn. But I digress.</p><p>Summoning Guitar Gurnards Duonigis, hands-down the coolest Sea Serpent, with Diva gets you level 7 or 8 synchros. With all your free summons, it just snowballs from there. Atlanteans do Atlantean things to hand-loop; DS Minstrel is an anti-handtrap; and the other Deep Seas are extenders when discarded/ss'd. Chengying might be a better pick than Bihamut, who just starts with higher attack. I wanted a big beatstick to contend with ""unaffected"" monsters. Duonigis does give an attack buff from the gy.</p><p>Sadly, we are only getting 1 Toad off of Bahamut Shark with this deck. The only level 2 Aqua that would fit with this deck is Swap Frog, and trying to field 2 of him is just too hard. Plus I don't wanna pay his tax when I could still run Ran instead. Boy I'm looking forward to these water cards. I hope they're not expensive.</p>"

Yata-Lock,"<p>Greetings! Are you a fan of Yata-Lock and Destiny Board? If you like both, this deck is for you. Also, compared to <strong><a href=""/deck/destiny-of-panda-334834"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my</a> <a href=""/deck/350771"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">previous</a></strong> Destiny Board setups I did, this one was easy to execute because the chance of hitting bricks are reduced. Alright, let's get started!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/21eiYg0v6Sc"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Draw until you find these combo pieces: Yata + Droll + Miracle Locus + Disturbance Strategy + Destiny Board. Meanwhile, bring forth Apollousa + Baronne. Then, set Disturbance + Miracle + Destiny and end your turn but not before changing the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"". You don't want to miss anything happening, do you?</p><ul><li>As seen in the video, I was about to discard my key pieces. Therefore, shuffle other letters with Saryuja to not risk them being sent to GY. If you are really concerned, you can add 1 x Infinite Cards as a workaround for discard issue, seen in ""Side Deck"". When you are about to place last letter, you can destroy ""Infinite Cards"" with Baronne anyways, so backrow space isn't an issue.</li><li>Similar to Dugares which can draw cards and skip your next Draw Phase to not deck-out, Daigusto can refill your Main Deck. As a mini ""Pot of Avarice"" with XYZ body, feel free to replace Dugares with Daigusto, if you wish. You can check Daigusto in ""Side Deck"".</li><li>""Sword of Deep-Seated"" was added to solve issues of deck-out. As you place letters with ""Destiny Board"", it will be inevitable you draw cards, leading into deck-out. By applying Deep-Seated to Yata, when you hit End Phase, Deep-Seated will be automatically destroyed after Yata has returned to your hand. As its ability, Deep-Seated will be placed on top of your Main Deck...<ul><li>Sabres can achieve the similar thing by shuffling one of your cards from your hand on top of your Main Deck to Special Summon itself. To make it a loop, you have to destroy Sabres with Baronne. You can check Sabres in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul></li></ul><p>2) During your opponent's Standby Phase, activate Miracle to let your opponent draw a card. Then, activate Disturbance and chain into Droll. What will happen is Droll denies for either side to add any card to their hand. Therefore, by shuffling your opponent's hand into deck with Disturbance, they won't be able to draw/add any card afterwards, all thanks to Droll.</p><p>3) Your opponent has nothing to do but pass the turn back to you. However, before that, activate ""Destiny Board"" if you haven't already at End Phase of your opponent and start placing letters. When it's your turn, destroy ""Chicken Game"" if present and Normal Summon Yata-Garasu. Attack the opponent with Yata, which denies your opponent from drawing any card.</p><p>4) Your opponent will be stuck forever. So, they can either surrender or wait for animation of ""Destiny Board"", as long as you repeat what was explained in #3. Either way, you win the duel!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Destiny Board"" can be found within ""The Trap in the Wicked Castle"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Mannadium Trisukta"" can be found within ""Indomitable Pride"" Timed Pack to save 30 SR!

Dinosaurs/ Dinowrestlers</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">1200+ word article.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">(In April 2023, I burnt out from being a teacher and applied to be a YGOPROdeck writer for some scratch cash for hobby writing. I sent a few articles and remember getting good feedback but then got ghosted. It didn't matter much anyways because even if I had gotten hired, my new job overwhelmed me to have little time to play YuGiOh or keep up with product)<br /><br />I found this lesson article written hastily in a week for that position on my pc and decided to upload it here.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are some of the most versatile Extra Deck monsters in the YuGiOh trading card game, capable of being summoned using generic material. Link monsters can also add more strategy to a player&rsquo;s extra deck and helping a player get out of a situation with no other meaningful plays. With their inclusion, players are also encouraged to consider which zones to place monsters, spells, and traps.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">However, Link Monsters are arguably trickier to summon in contrast with their previous Extra Deck monster types: Fusions, Synchros, and XYZ with regards to Link Zones and Link Ratings. With the latest Wild Survivor Set bringing Dinosaurs back to the forefront, and seeing many players at my locals get into the game with the Traptrix structure deck, I wanted to write an introduction on how to Link Summon, using the Dinosaur archetype as an example and to see how the Dinosaur archetype link climbs with the new card support!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Summoning Basics</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Summoning is most often performed by using Monsters a player controls as Link Material for a Link Monster. During their Main Phase, if the game state is open, the turn player can Link Summon a Link Monster from their Extra Deck by sending face-up monsters they control that correspond to the Link Monster&rsquo;s summoning requirements equal Link Monster&rsquo;s Link Rating to the Graveyard as Link Materials. The Link Monster is Summoned in either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster on the field points to in face-up Attack Position.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Ratings are defined by the number on the Bottom Right, in the place where most monsters have a defense point number. The Link Rating is formed by the addition of Link Monster ratings and non-link Monsters used for the summon. For instance, the Link Monster Saryuja Skull Dread has a Link rating of 4 and has the Link Material requirement of &ldquo;2+ monsters with different names&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you could use a 4 monsters, a Link 3 and any other monster, two Link 2&rsquo;s, etc. Another way to think of this is a non-link monster can be thought of as a Link 1 material.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are unique in that they are monsters that have no defense and can only be in face-up Attack Position, a condition that no other monster type has. Thus, cards that force monsters to be in defense position such as Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir or Scareclaw Tri-Heart have no effect on Link Monsters.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Arrows</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Arrows are important as they give positions for which other Link Monsters can be summoned. However, more importantly, Link Monster often have abilities that correspond to the place where their arrows point.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are Summoned in either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster on the field points to in face-up Attack Position. A player can only use one Extra Monster Zone. However, a player can claim both extra monster zones if their link monsters point to both monster zones, which is a very impressive feat. Unlike other extra deck monster types, which are free to be placed anywhere on your board, Link Monsters must be summoned to a zone a Link Monster Points to, otherwise they must be in the extra monster zones. As such, a player must be careful which zones they summon to. For instance, if a player fusion summoned a monster with a spell and placed that monster in the extra monster zone, and had no other link monsters, that player cannot link summon unless they use that fusion summoned monster as material.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Arrows are important because many Link Monster have special varying based on their Link Arrows. For instance, the Link 3 monster card Transcendonsarus Exaraptor has Link Arrows Pointing Up, Left, and Right. Its ability states that if a face-up Dinosaur monster(s) this points to is destroyed by battle or sent to the GY: You can draw one card. So, in the case of a dinosaur deck, a player could be encouraged to use the cards Lost World or Dogoroan, the Mad Flame Kaiju to summon a dinosaur in a zone that will point on the Link 3 monster will point to and destroy it later.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"">As a bit of trivia, upon release, players were not allowed to summon any Extra Deck monsters outside the two Extra Monster Zones unless linked. As such, link summoning on release was wedged into the game, and many players disliked the mechanic. Decks had to shoehorn link summoning into their deck. Alternatively, many tournament players used decks that did not utilize the extra deck at all such as Monarchs or True Dracos or used decks that banished Extra Deck monster such as True King Dinos.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Link Archetypes/ Strategies</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Link Monsters are arguably the most versatile extra deck monster, requiring none of the specific monster levels that Synchros and XYZ require nor the Specific monsters that Fusions require. In addition, Link Monster have a host of generic support such as Knightmares, which can be used for spot removal, or Charmers. In addition, with boss monsters such as Appaloosa Bow of the Goddess and Accesscode Talkers, Link monsters are great for many decks that can produce many creatures in one turn. In addition, the classic sideboard card Dimensional Barrier does not prevent Link Monsters from being summoned from the extra deck and provides an alternate series of deck types against these duels. Duelists are encouraged to experiment with extra deck archetypes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Several Archetypes revolve around Link Summoning multiple times to climb to more and more powerful monster. As such, the term Link Climbing became slang for using another Link Monster as material. Some classic decks include Salamgreats, Sky Strikers, @Ignister. Dinosaurs have their own specific archetype: Dinowrestlers, but most meta Dino decks splash generic Link Support for their strategy. As such, Duelists are encouraged to experiment with several rations of their monsters alongside other extra deck archetypes.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For this example, many Dinosaur Decks run many generic and niche Link cards to support this strategy. Link monsters are also great for extending plays or setting up future players. For instance, Dinosaur decks often use card Animadorned Archosaur to search for Double Evolution Pill. In order to achieve the requirements of a non-dinosaur monster for Pill, a player can link away Animadorned Archosaur with Linkuriboh, a Link 1 that can stall the game but also achieve the second monster necessary for pill.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As a general guide, Link Decks would be advised to count their summons up to 4 in case of a Nibiru hand trap, which can be catastrophic against a Link Deck. If a player summons 5 or more monsters during their turn, Nibiru can be activated to tribute all monsters on the field. Against Link monster, this will end with each Link Monsters being tributed for 0 def. As such, players are advised to stop at 4 or end with a monster negate such as Apolloussa, Bow of the Goddess.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I hope this guide helped introduce you to the Link Summoning. While I had originally wanted to describe Link Monsters in Dinosaur decks, I was surprised to discover their rich and jaded history. I started the game a little confused with Link Monsters and Link scales, so I hope this guide makes players less confused and more intrigued. Today, I always manage to splash a few link monsters into most of my decks with their sheer versatility. I&rsquo;m always excited to see more Link monsters being released into the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Running the D/D/D/D Boss for possible in-engine floodgate boardwipes from hand. (Buster Lock, Bagooska, Skill Drain, etc.) This deck can run basic 1 card combo's, however requires lots of practice and experimentation to make full use of the 2 and 3 card combos the deck offers. Attached is a link to the D/D/D starter combo guide: <a>https://www.masterduelmeta.com/articles/guides/d-d-d-combo-guide-yusodus</a></p><p>This deck is not running D/D/D Oracle so certain combo lines from the combo guide are limited due to an emphasis on board breaking/interruption with Super Polymerization. The deck is fairly consistent, however on brick hands you can set Super Poly and pass with Maxx C, to hopefully fuse into Garura or Mudragon using your opponent's board. You can fuse into Garura to out a Nibiru and Nibiru token as well with Super Poly. I would recommend playtesting this deck on EDO Pro or YGO Omega, however it's fairly cheap in Master Duel compared to newer Meta decks. D/D/D is a very fun deck to learn, as well as experiment with. You can run the Zeus, Vice King Build. Kali Yuga Lock build with Wonder Xyz, as well as Doom King build.&nbsp;</p><p>Example Combo:</p><p>1 Card Kepler to summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga: Normal Summon Kepler - Add Dark Contract With the Gate - Activate Gate's effect - Add D/D Gryphon from deck to hand. - Special Summon D/D Gryphon using Gryphon's effect - Link into D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh - Place Scales D/D Orthros, D/D Savant Thomas - Activate D/D Savant Thomas's pendulum effect to add Kepler from face up extra deck to hand - Activate D/D Orthros pendulum effect to pop D/D Savant Thomas and Dark Contract with the Gate - Place Kepler in Scales - Pendulum Summon D/D Savant Thomas and D/D Gryphon - Activate D/D Savant Thomas's field effect to summon D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok from deck - Xyz Summon D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga using D/D Savant Thomas, and D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy, and have fun experimenting, as D/D/D has a ton of great combos.</p>"

Primal Seed + Morphing Jar #2,"<p>Hey, how you doing? A while ago, I <a href=""/deck/morphing-jarpot-422574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>won</strong></a> with Jackpot 7 by utilizing Morphing Jar #2. However, there was a chance you could fail. This time, as long as you have time to establish the setup needed, you can absolutely win with Jackpot 7 alongside MJ2 by disregarding any margin of error. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLUP6su5LmU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant at least one flower to opposing side with ""Black Garden"" and play ""Double Summon"". Double will be used for putting MJ2 as Set.</p><p>2) When you have 4 cards in your Main Deck, Link Summon Saryuja and activate it. There, you draw all remaining cards and shuffle back three, which has to be ""Jackpot 7"".</p><p>3) Special Summon Kuriboh with Saryuja and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, place MJ2 as Set.</p><p>4) If you have Main Deck monsters on the battlefield, other than Chaos + Kuriboh + MJ2, get rid of them by passing to opposing side with ""Mystic Box"" while eradicating the flowers. When you have only these three, only pass MJ2 to your opponent with ""Mystic Box"" for one last time.</p><p>5) When you have ""Monster Reborn"" + ""Monster Reincarnation"" in your hand, activate ""Book of Taiyou"" on MJ2 to open it. While MJ2 triggers, you will shuffle back Chaos + Kuriboh + MJ2 to your Main Deck and in the end, MJ2 will be placed as face-down while Chaos + Kuriboh were sent to GY.</p><p>6) Besides the events happening in #5, there is a chance you can hit all three Jackpot 7 cards. Since MJ2 was placed to your opponent's side, the effects coming from MJ2 were considered to be done by your opponent. Therefore, by milling all three Jackpot 7 cards, you win the duel. Even if you own MJ2, this fact won't change...</p><ul><li>However, the excavate effect of MJ2 isn't guaranteed to find Jackpot 7 cards since you shuffle your Main Deck. If you miss any one of Jackpot 7 cards, that means you have to repeat same setup done in #4 + #5.</li><li>In order to do so, first play ""Monster Reborn"" and target on Kuriboh. Reason is that, in case you didn't realize already, ""Winged Kuriboh LV9"" sends any activated Spell cards into BZ instead of GY. Since ""Primal Seed"" can only fetch cards from BZ, I think you see the pattern now.</li><li>With Kuriboh present, you can play ""Monster Reincarnation"" to add Chaos Emperor from your GY back to your hand. Return from BZ to GY, 1 x LIGHT + 1 x DARK monster, with ""Burial from a Different Dimension"" and Special Summon Chaos Emperor via its ability. Your ""Primal Seed"" loop is completely restructured.</li><li>While Special Summoning monsters, ""Black Garden"" is going to plant flowers to opposing side. Give MJ2 to the opponent with ""Mystic Box"" and fetch all combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"" loop, which are Mystic Box + Monster Reincarnation + Monster Reborn + Different Dimension + Book of Taiyou. Finally, play ""Book of Taiyou"" on MJ2.</li></ul><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #6 until you have milled all three Jackpot 7 cards with MJ2 to win the duel!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Jackpot 7"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 150 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 690 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

This deck is simply brilliant, as it represents the 9 Deadly Sins, and not just the traditional 7, as many think. The Catholic Church has tried to hide two of these sins, but we will not let this go unnoticed.</p><p>Let's start with Asmodeus, the sin of Lust, represented by the card ""Darklord Asmodeus"". This card is as powerful as it is tempting. The next sin is Gluttony, represented by Beelzebub and the card ""Darklord Tezcatlipoca"". Mammon represents Greed with the card ""Darklord Desire"" and Belphegor personifies Sloth through the card ""Darklord Nergal"". Azazel that represents Wrath is actually the card ""Darklord Nasten"" and a Daemon (sin Envy) that represents the card ""Darklord Amdusc"". We cannot forget the powerful Lucifer, Pride himself, who manifests himself in the card ""Darklord Morningstar"".</p><p>But the fun doesn't stop there! We also have Zarathos, representing Heresy with the card ""Darklord Zerato"", Ixchel representing Idolatry with the card ""Darklord Ixchel"" and the two ""Darklords"" who do not represent capital sins, but rather human evil who are &ldquo;Darklord Indulged&rdquo; who represents lack of faith, &ldquo;Darklord Capricious&rdquo; which represents Vanity. Darklord Condemned, who represents ""sorcery"" and Darklord Ukoback, the servants of demons who are the opposites of guardian angels.</p><p>And to finish with a flourish, we have the imposing ""Darklord Lord Edeh Arae"", who represents Death. In Japan, he is known as a shinigami, a demon tasked with taking souls to the underworld. He is a demon general who controls a legion of demons, being subordinate to demons of higher hierarchy. His power is such that he can cause the death of anyone in several ways, with cardiac arrest being his favorite.</p><p>The treacherous shadows are lurking, ready to seduce you with all the worldly pleasures, causing you to gain weight and settle in darkness. You will be enveloped in dark comfort, but beware, for the last meal will be your own being, devouring you slowly, without mercy. My dear sinner, and come join us in the infernal abyss, where terrible fate awaits you. Haha ha!</p>"

Fusion Gate + Starving Venom + Primal Seed,"<p>Welcome! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" thanks to ""Independent Nightingale"". With Banisher and Fusion Gate around, you can cycle mats needed with ""Primal Seed"", making it a complete loop. Let's go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFSIN-sKf30"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) First, place a plant to your opponent's field with ""Black Garden"". Next, bring out Swallow and play ""Cattle Call"" to replace it with Nightingale. Then, give Nightingale to opposing side by replacing the flower with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>2) After you have Link Summoned Saryuja, Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>3) Place ""Fusion Gate"" and raise the level of Nightingale to 5, which is needed to copycat Nightingale with Starving. Then, Special Summon Jester with its ability to Link Summon Barber by using Saryuja + Jester as materials.</p><p>4) Since the Special Summon ability of Jester isn't hard-once per turn, you can repeat it as many times as you like. Fetch Jester from BZ with ""Primal Seed"" and Special Summon it. Then, activate ""Fusion Gate"" to Fusion Summon Starving by using Barber + Jester as materials.</p><p>5) Copycat Nightingale with Starving to deal 8 x 500 = 4000 damage in total. Since the copycat ability of Starving isn't hard once-per turn, you can repeat it. To do so, return Barber + Jester to Extra Deck and hand with ""Primal Seed"". Then, Special Summon Jester with its ability to Link Summon Barber by using Starving + Jester as materials.</p><p>6) Special Summon Jester and return Starving to Extra Deck with ""Primal Seed"". Then, Fusion Summon Starving with Barber + Jester. In short, repeat these steps explained in #4 + #5, while copycatting Nightingale with Starving and pulling the trigger, until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Remember, you can repeat this process by resetting Plump with Book spells and it shouldn't contain more than 9 materials.

Once upon a time, I have done a FTK setup with <a href=""/deck/reunion-of-venom-bros-409183"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Independent Nightingale,</strong></a> where every single variant of Venom Fusion monsters were used to burn your opponent to death. This time, Venom Bros are up to task to mill your opponent with Librarian. Let's go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNvyVNhvxCA"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant all five flowers to opposing side with ""Black Garden"". Next, Link Summon Saryuja and place ""Fusion Gate"".</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, give Librarian to opposing side by getting rid of a flower and replacing with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>3) With ""Primal Seed"" loop and probably Panda/Reborn, Fusion Summon all Venom Bros with ""Fusion Gate"" and activate their abilities to copycat Librarian. Then, replace flowers with them via ""Mystic Box"", similar to how you did in #2 for Librarian. Here is an example of Fusion Summon order and note that ""H"" is for in-hand and ""F"" is for field:</p><ol><li>Fusion Summon ""Supreme King Dragon"" by using Odd-Eyes (H) + Zero King (H) as materials. Don't copycat with ""Supreme King Dragon"" just yet.</li><li>Fetch Odd-Eyes with ""Primal Seed"" and Fusion Summon ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" by using Supreme King (F) + Odd-Eyes (H) as materials. Copycat Librarian with Venom Dragon and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fetch Odd-Eyes + Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and try Fusion Summoning ""Supreme King Dragon"" again. This time, you can copycat Librarian with Supreme King and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom"" by using 2 x DARK (F) as materials. As long as you don't use Chaos Emperor as material by accident, you will be fine. Just like the others, copycat Librarian with Starving Venom and pass it with ""Mystic Box"".</li><li>Fetch Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and Fusion Summon ""Starving Venemy"" by using DARK (H or F) + Zero King (H) as materials. Similar to previous setup, don't use Chaos Emperor as material by accident. Copycat Librarian with Venemy and replace Librarian with Venemy by destroying Librarian with ""Mystic Box"".</li></ol><p>4) If you have done everything correct so far, there should be 4 x Venom monsters disguised as ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"", ready to mill your opponent. Refill the last spot by reviving Librarian with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroying the flower with ""Mystic Box"".</p><p>5) Fetch Zero King with ""Primal Seed"" and Special Summon Zero King with Saryuja. Tribute any two monsters but Chaos Emperor with Zero King to shut down anything your opponent can activate from Hand + GY + Backrow in the future.</p><p>6) Choose a monster you are going to Synchro Summon over and over again with ""De-Synchro"". I picked Ancient by using Panda + Martial as materials but any Synchro will do. Arrange your monsters accordingly with Panda and Reborn, if you must.</p><p>7) Each time you Synchro Summon, your opponent is going to draw 5 cards. Repeat what was explained in #6 until your opponent is out of cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"" can be collected by purchasing ""Magician of Pendulum"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Zero King Rage"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" can be found within ""Draconic Resplendence"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"" can be found within ""Celestial Dragon and Bear"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Black Garden + Fusion Gate + Land Flipping,"<p>Welcome! This is a basic deck, where the aim is to burn your opponent with Volcannon by targeting Jizukiru forever. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEbNfgoEL1k"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Activate ""Black Garden"" and ""Fusion Gate"". To make sure either are present on the field, pass one of them to your opponent with ""Land Flipping"".</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, replace a flower with Jizukiru. In return, ""Black Garden"" is going to plant a flower to your side, just like how you refilled your opponent's side by Summoning monsters on your side.</p><p>3) When you have Inari in your hand, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to change everything as&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>into&nbsp;<strong>Machine.</strong> Next, activate ""Fusion Gate"", wherever it is, by banishing Inari from your hand and any monster but Chaos Emperor from your field as materials to Fusion Summon Volcannon.</p><p>4) Target Jizukiru with Volcannon to deal original ATK of Jizukiru as damage to your opponent, which is 3300. Volcannon doesn't look at ATK modifications done on the field. Instead, Volcannon checks the ATK of monster in GY, that's why the damage output was higher than it would seem.</p><p>5) With Jizukiru + Volcannon being destroyed, banish them with ""Soul Release"". Then, fetch Jizukiru + Inari to your hand with ""Primal Seed"" and return Volcannon to Extra Deck with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>6) To make it a loop, repeat these steps from 2 to 5, until your opponent is dead. Since you will always get a flower by placing Jizukiru to your opponent's side thanks to ""Black Garden"", you can always Fusion Summon Volcannon without any issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Volcannon"" + ""Land Flipping"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 90 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Try to summon Junk Speeder as soon as possible, and summon Satellite, Jet, and Junk Synchron from the deck, if you have to summon Quickdraw along side, just try to keep Road Synchron in your deck as much as possible. If you used Dopplewarrior for the synchro summon, activate his effect after Junk Speeder to get the two tokens. After that you can go into Crystal Wing if you cannot extend, or the appropriate synchro for the situation. They are a few ways you can summon Shooting Quasar on your first turn, however you can only get it with Junk Speeder(5), Scarred Warrior(5), Stardust Charge(6), Accel Synchro(tuner and adjustable levels wanting either 1, or 2) or Synchro Formula(2). If you can get Speeder/Scarred out with Stardust Charge, and Accel Synchro, you will want to send Road Synchron to the grave to reduce the level by 4. If you have Speeder, and Scarred, you can use either Formula, or Accel Synchro by sending Junk Synchron to the grave. Either way, you will be able to get other monsters out if you cannot go for Quasar.</p>"
