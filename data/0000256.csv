Synchro players and link players are shaking 'cuz Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is hunting.,"If you want to play Dinosaurs I think that this is the best way possible for them to be played. I'll go card by card and explain why is it in a deck 'cuz why not explain maybe newer players why is something like it is and also explain to other real players why I think it is the best choice to be like this.

First we got Main Deck:

2x Animadorned Archosaur-You do not want to draw this card most of the times, but it still can be a start of your combo in this deck with Babycerasaurus in your hand since it does trigger Babycerasaurus and also adds to your hand Double Evolution Pill but mostly, you want to get it from Miscellaneosaurus to your field after you use Miscellaneosaurus's hand effect that sends Misc to the graveyard and protects 90% of your deck from hand traps and then gives you ability to summon your Archosaur from Misc's effect.

1x Artifact Scythe-it stops most of the decks from playing the game, and in this deck, it doesn't have to be a brick in the hand 'cuz most of the times you do not want to go for Dagda+Anaconda 'cuz it takes away to much of your combo materials and stops any other plays you could've done instead of those two, so if you draw Scythe and you are not unlucky like me to draw: Scythe, Celestial, Dasher 1/3 duels (around once per match) then you should get to a good combo even if you draw scythe.

3x Babycerasaurus-you drew this and Archo, go for Double Evolution and Souleating Oviraptor, you summoned token through Lost World to your opponent's field and used Token Collector effect, you get a free Baby effect. This card is not once per turn and in this deck except this two ways you will most likely easily get to this card through Misc, Ovi, you will gain effect of it through Archo, Fossil Dig can give it to you, Lost World can trigger it with Token Collector in duo and that in the deck is alredy 30% of the cards that can give you advantage of this card that is not a once per turn card, which means it can be used with it's effect multiple times per turn so it being at three and adding 37.5% of drawing it on top of all of abilitys to tribute it and trigger it is incredibly powerful in this deck.

1x Destiny HERO - Celestial-part of the DPE engine that is also a +2 in every deck that uses DPE engine

1x Destiny HERO - Dasher-part of DPE engine which also gives you free special summon on your draw phase and is mostly used for Celestial's draw effect.

1x Dinowrestler Pankratops-this card is a one time Zoodiac Drident, it is a good going second card, but is also a good going first card since it can be summoned with the effect of petiteranodon.

1x Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju-classic Kaiju, following the type since it can, good going second interuption with opponent's monsters like DPE, Dragoon (yes, I am seeing some Dragoons), Prank-Kids Battle Buttler etc.

1x Giant Rex-sometimes you will decide that you are on your period and that you want Laggia or Dolkka on your field after summoning the all mighty Ultimate Conductor Tyranno so when you banish this card with Double Evouliton Pill or for Ultimate Conductor Tyranno summoning condition it is automaticaly summoned to your field, and since sometimes you will have 1 Oviraptor on your field which is also level 4, this card is perfect for xyz summoning. It can also make Exciton Knight, Abyss Dweler or Dugares, which can with it's draw effect dig even more through your deck.

1x Miscellaneosaurus-first of all, it can be searched with something like Oviraptor. Now when you have it you can use it's hand effect to make your dinosaur effects unafected by any of your opponent's hand traps and effects which is perfect 'cuz then your opponent is not able to ever again interupt you during that turn. This card is also limited, otherwise if it was not and was unlimited like in the past, it would be played at 3.

1x Petiteranodon-if you use your Babycerasaurus's effect to summon this little guy and you tribute it on your opponent's turn with your Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, you get a free Pankratops that is one time Drident. Most of the times you do not want to draw it and want it on the field with Babycerasaurus's effect.

3x PSY-Framegear Gamma-if you are going second, this card is like one time impermanence, and if you are going first and your opponent uses something like ash blossom on your fossil dig or Engage or Terraforming, you can after negate also go into Framelord Omega which is like an upgraded version of zoodiac Drident which is curently banned.

Souleating Oviraptor-this is 1 of few starters you have, it searches your Misc, Misc triggers and summons Archo, Archo gives you Double Evolution and maybe triggers Baby, or if you are half unlucky Petiteranodon, then Oviraptor activates and get's rid of your Archo and gets back hopefuly Baby and on and on and on with all other combos.

1x Token Collector-if you use Lost World to summon token for your opponent to their field and then trigger Collector, you get a free monster on the field and since Lost World protects the tokens, you can for free destroy Baby from your deck to get a free monster to your field, and if you did not draw Souleating you can get it of the Baby, which is a good 2 card combo that I think cannot be negated with anything else except for Ghost Ogre.

3x Ultimate Conductor Tyranno-boss monster+soft once per turn book of moon+attacks all monsters your opponent controls+prevents link summoning.

1x PSY-Frame Driver-without it Gamma is unable to activate, so you have to have at least 1 in the deck.

1x Called By the Grave-it can on your turn negate a hand trap that is a monster and goes to gy as a cost like ash or ghost ogre (so imperm can still go through it, also can PSY) and it on your opponent's turn can also negate some kind of a graveyard effect or if your opponent has a copy of a card in his graveyard and a copy of the same card on the field, you can negate the card on the field by banishing the copy in the gy.

2x Double Evolution Pill-this card is on 2 'cuz we play 2 searchers, also you do not want to draw this card, you want to search it 'cuz of destroying part of Archo so it can trigger Baby or Petiteranodon.

3x Fossil Dig-it searches any starter combo piece you need in this deck, so it is pretty welcome at 3.

2x Fusion Destiny-as much as you want to get to it through Anaconda, that much you will want it in your hand and you will need as much copys as possible to legaly be in your deck.

3x Lost World-it gives your monsters protection from some effects like Forbidden Chalice and also can be combined with Token Collector to go for free Baby effect that can for free give you Souleating that can give you misc that gives you protection and Archo that gives you double Evolution Pill that can summon Conductor and also you can go into Abyss or Exciton or link Souleating and Token Collector into anaconda and Archo into linkuriboh and with Anaconda get the DPE. In my opinion it is solid two card combo.

1x Sky Strike Mecha - Hornet Drones-in my opinion Sky Striker engine is still a good engine since it can itself give you Dagda: with Engage you add Drones, with Drones you get a token and go to Kagari that gives you back drones and summons 1 more token which is level 1 so you can go into linkuriboh and then go to Dagda and all of this with this little engine. And now with no Normal Summons you go further with Dinos and at the start you get Scythe seted and since you will most of the times go into Anaconda for DPE, you alredy gave yourself an ability to lock your opponent's extra deck.

1x Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!-this card searches Hornet Drones and is the part of the Sky Striker engine

2x Small World-this card can literally search any card you want from your deck. There was not anymore place so it is on 2 and I think you will never see more than 2 except in 60 card decks.

1x Terraforming-is here to search Lost World and you alredy readed the combo.

Now for the Extra Deck:

1x Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer-it is a non-target destruction effect card that summons itself back in the next standby phase and is a part of DPE engine which is pretty powerful since it can be done over and over again every single turn and since you will mostly send Dasher and Celestial, both having a good effects so you can summon DPE, you will really be in plus with engine based around summoning this card.

1x PSY-Framelord Omega-it is a synchro version of DPE, just a little bit worse, but it instead of destroying (since some cards have good graveyard effects) it banishes from hand (which means your opponent would start with 1 less card).

1x Abyss Dweler-it stops Tenyi Swordsoul, Eldlich, Drytron comebacks, Tri-Brigade, DPE engine, Scythe engine...that is a lot of things that are in the current meta and only one card that is easy to summon can stop those from being what they are from 60% to 100%.

1x Evilswarm Exciton Knight-just a clean up after you seted everything with Tyranno's effect so you have a free attack into opponent's LP.

1x Evolzar Dolkka-negating a monster effect is pretty strong nowadays since most combos start with monsters and their effects and since this is not once per turn and the card has 2 materials, you can negate monster effect twice which can sometimes completely shut down whole combo.

1x Evolzar Laggia-this is 1 time walking Solemn Judgment (or the NO card) and Solemn Judgment itself is pretty powerful card, so negating a Normal Summon can, first be funny and second be really helpful. Negating a Golden Land/Eldlixir spell/trap is pretty good if playing against Eldlich, perfectly if you negate Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine that summons the Eldlich from the deck.

1x Gallant Granite-this searches Nibiru, if your opponent plays Prank Kids this is good and can be helpful in game two and three.

1x Number 60: Dugares and Timeless-this card's first effect is something you are looking for since it can make your combo longer sometimes if you of course draw the right cards.

1x Artifact Dagda-this puts Scythe on your field and after summoning DPE and resolving Scythe your opponent can just surrender, unless he is playing Altergeist or Eldlich or Dinosaurs that can get out of that situation and go into a fair respectfull board.

1x Dharc, the Dark Charmer, Gloomy-since Phantom Knight's are still a meta, it can take your opponent's Phantom Knight and make your combo a little bit longer, can give you Unicorn...

1x Knightmare Unicorn-it shuffles 1 card your opponent controls into the deck. Yes it targets but most of the cards are not unafected by targeting nowadays.

1x Linkuriboh-was always a good battle protection card and will always be a good battle protection card, and it can be also summoned with Archo as material.

1x Pentastag-you used Conductor's effect but you want to do more then 1000 damage, so if you summon this card that way that Tyranno is linked to it, you have a 3500 atk beatstick that can do piercing on every opponent's monster.

1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda-part of DPE engine.

1x Sky Striker Ace - Kagari-part of the Sky Striker engine

And now for the Side Deck:

3x Artifact Lancea-this stops Tenyi Swordsoul and Tri-Brigade decks, also stops Floowandereeze decks and it is that way good.

1x Nibiru, the Primal Being-is searchable, so you only need 1 if going first and you know your opponent plays something like Phantom Knight's or Prank-Kids, it is good to use this card on time.

2x Token Collector-in case opponent plays Swordsoul deck, this is a perfect card to stop that deck.

3x Twin Twisters-this card is good in this format since trap cards got some popularity and this card can destroy spell and trap cards, two of them, so Eldlich, Altergeist or something that plays traps is gone to this card most of the times.

3x Ice Dragon's Prison-mostly for Eldlich decks since Eldlich players for some reason play only two Eldliches, instead of 3 (dumb move Eldlich Players), you can banish both of those with this. Also Swordsoul can be stoped in some way with this and Phantom Knight's can be interrupted...

3x Summon Limit-goodbye Prank-Kids, goodbye Phantom Knight's. goodbye Tenyi Swordsoul, goodbye to any meta that special summons a lot, this card is their end.

I like this deck. It is the first Dinosaur deck I ever made and I hope there is not something bad within it. If you know a way how to make it even better tell me in the comments please."

Who needs warriors when you have Cyberse?,"""Code Talker""

This is an archetype that is rarely looked at and thought of as an archetype. Most people know our friends, <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, who are members, but no one really knows the mountains of direct and incidental support this archetype has received over the years. Obviously Decode Talker is no longer the powerhouse he was in Master Rule 4, being the best generic Link monster to give yourself two more zones for Extra Deck monsters, but Accesscode has become <em>the</em> de facto boss monster for any deck playing Link monsters these days. Painfully generic and able to break boards and OTK like no one's business. But what if I told you there were more ""Code Talker"" monsters, and that they can be used to Extra Link, just like back in the good old Gouki days, only with fewer bricks in deck.

I can't describe the entire combo line, nor can I commentate on the sheer number of extenders the deck has access to, but DistantCoder, the Code Talker master, has been honing this deck for a couple years now, and he has a couple videos, which I will link <a>here</a> (deck profile) and <a>here</a> (combo tutorials). However, these are for an older build. The new build, posted below, can now make a triple co-linked <a data-name=""Tri-Gate Wizard"">Tri-Gate Wizard</a> and a <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> for extra protection, and I'll post a video of my own from DuelingBook to illustrate the new combo line <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/OMxGXWJu4w4"">here</a>.

One thing that is worth noting, though: <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> is incredible in this deck. Since all monsters are Cyberse, but they all have different levels, stats, and attributes, you can go from any monster in hand to any monster in the deck. It's simply a great card that allows even the brickiest of hands (of which there are truthfully very few) to reach full combo and lock the opponent out."

You can also try and go for the Draco Berserker OTK if you are going second. Most of the time, you want to open cards like Mo Ye, Longyuan, and Ecclesia to get your combo going. Cards like Emergence and Vessel provide you with a consistent way to search your monsters from your deck, allowing you easy access to both your starters and extenders. 1/4 of your deck (10 Cards) is composed of handtraps, which means that even on your opponent's turn, you can still negate your opponent's card effects and stop your opponent's plays. Overall, I think that the deck is very consistent and fun to play, so I highly recommend that you try it out for yourself."

Your main 2-card combo is Souleating Oviraptor and Babycerasaurus which if played correclty, can end on DPE, Verte, and UCT. This deck also utilizes cards like Fossil Dig and Small World to easily search your starters and extenders. Overall, I think that the deck is very consistent and can compete with the current meta if played correctly."

This will be the last build I'll be exploring for Buster Blader.
For ful","This is the third and last variant I'll be exploring for Buster Blader. Playing this deck, I believe that dropping Formula Synchron &amp; Satellite Warrior for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss &amp; Crusadia Magius would be way more beneficial for Borreload Savage Dragon since you'll be sending Crystron Halqifibrax to the grave. Having Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman on the field would help in case you can't attack with Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman. You can use Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman to burn you opponent for Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman's attack points. Plus, having an extra negate with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss feels way better. The reason why we need a 2nd copy of Crusadia Magius is in case the 1st gets destroyed. As usual, even with the previous builds, we utilize Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with the protection of I:P Masquerena for going 2nd, to stall and to beat over and all special summoned monsters.

Halq is a good link","Your goal is to end with a DPE + Babel minimum on board + Dingirsu in the GY.

Standard full combo endboard is DPE + Babel + set Scythe + PUNK trap.

Opening E-Tele is full combo.

Opening Girsu or Scrap Recycler is standard board.

Opening E-Tele+ MKPurple/Girsu/Recycler is full combo that plays through Nibiru.

For full combo (E-Tele+MKPurple/Girsu/Recycler+3 random cards):

 	<li>Normal Summon Girsu/Recycler -&gt; send Orcust Knightmare/World Wand/Cymbal Skeleton (in that priority order)</li>
 	<li>Girsu/Recycler+Galatea = Artifact Dagda (if you have a way to trigger Dagda, one of the following)
<ul>
 	<li>A spell (E-Tele/Babel/Foolish Burial/Fusion Destiny)</li>

If you didn't have a way to activate Dagda, you can make I:P instead to Unicorn on their turn.

Compared to current common Orcust endboards, this isn't much fancier aside from having one more monster negate (PUNK trap) and Scythe lock possibly. The benefit of this build is that the Halq combo attracts the Ash, Imperm, and Nib before you have to Normal Summon (assuming you open E-Tele).

Once a naughty word, and the boogeyman of Yu-Gi-Oh!, now a decent budget deck for locals.","Salamangreat is a classic from 2019's so-called ""Eternal Format"". Once feared and loathed by much of the competitive landscape, after several nerfs and not being able to keep up with 17-negate boards, it fell far out of favor. It's still a fine rogue pick for your locals, though, and fairly inexpensive. The loss of 2 <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> hurt the deck's card advantage quite a lot, but an additional copy <a data-name=""Salamangreat Circle"">Salamangreat Circle</a> is an incredible boon for the deck. The compact engine allows the deck to play a robust hand trap package, and the particular hand traps you want to play in the main deck can be tailored for your local meta.

Salamangreat has the ability to put up a fight through the long game by constantly recycling interruptions and keeping the hand traps coming out off the top of the deck, threatening to grind out any deck not prepared to play a turn 3 or 4. Plus, since every monster in the deck (that you want to summon, anyway) is Cyberse, you can comfortably play under a floodgate like <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> and still easily assemble lethal with a double-attacking, 5300 ATK <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> courtesy of <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> bringing back your <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a>.

Overall, this deck is a great budget option for the locals player who just wants to get out there and jam some games. Give it a shot, and surely you'll love it."

Plus, you still get to summon your <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a> in the midst of all of this combo goodness!

The deck is incredibly powerful, albeit quite expensive, and a little bricky for the current format. Still, it's a great choice for people who think their fellow duelists aren't ready for the power of DINO DNA, BABY!"

<span>There are a lot of cards you can take into account when building your deck, making the archetype really flexible, focus on link summons and keep in mind the support of their Magic/Trap cards.</span>

Your <strong>Boss Monster</strong> in this build will be <strong><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong>, so you want to get him on the field as soon as possible, summoned with <strong><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></strong> of course. Summoned this way Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax: It will be immune to destruction by effect, cannot be selected and the opponent cannot select another monster for an attack other than this one, plus if it fights with a special summoned card it will gain as much attack as that monster's attack during that damage calculation, which makes it your biggest attack/defense and a big headache for your opponent; Remember that it can still be banished or returned to the hand with effects that do not select or sacrificed by Kaijus monsters, in which case its effect will be triggered and you will be able to return to the deck a card if it was sent to the graveyard.

Here some starting combos, tips on how to start yours plays:

<strong><em>Important notes:</em></strong>
<p>- Don't activate the effects of Evil★Twin Link monsters (this turn you can only summon Fiends Monsters from the extra deck) until you have summoned I:P Masquerena or you will have ruined the combo.
- You can search from the deck ""<a data-name=""Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch"">Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch</a>"" with the effect of ""<a data-name=""Secret Password"">Secret Password</a>"", which adds you a Live☆Twin monster when activated.
- If your opponent denies you the effect of your Cyberse-type Live☆Twin remember that their Non-Cyberse-type versions can be special summoned if her twin is on the field.</p>

<p><strong>Some tips:</strong>
- You can steal an opponent's monster on their turn with the effect of <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> to Summon <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a>.
- <a data-name=""Evil★Twin GG EZ"">Evil★Twin GG EZ</a> is a great card that can negate destruction, sending one of your Evil★Twin to the graveyard, which is perfect since you can bring it back to the field and trigger its effects.
- You can carry a copy or not of ""<a data-name=""Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la"">Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</a>"", it's not essential, but keep in mind that it's a great come-back, it's Special Summoned from the graveyard so you can discard it to pay any effect.</p>"

(in my local i arrived 3) the strategy for this deck is summoning the key card number 99, this card should provide you, with his effect, number 38 and the new utopia ray (taht means 2 negates for your oppponets cards), then i play 3 onomatopickup because i love consitency and only 1 zexal contrsction because is a -1 in our hands. basically the combo is, with 2 level 4 card i special summon utopic sage, then with utopic sage i summon ZS ascendent sage, then i special summon another level 4 monster ( thast why  with the combo onomautopia, gagaga and dododo is very strong) so i special summon utopia and above c39, then i add to my hand hyper rank up, that allow me to summon number 99, so the strategy is done. if i can special summon other i monster i certainly summon abyss dweller or number f0 depends what deck my oppo is playing.

i achieve you to watch combo videos on YOUTUBE

Please comment on your favorite out of the three, and ","The third and possibly final variation of the Chaos Ogdoadic deck I made. The deck is tightly packed and more refined, but it doesn't have as much combo potential as the other two variants. It has the XYZ OTK engine in there, even though that is nothing special at this point. Also, less engine space means more room for hand traps. This way, it is much easier to focus on reptile control, but still not being completely punished by your opponent for trying to play the game. It is still easy to make a good enough board, and possibly a Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres, because, well, who doesn't want card bounce? The deck was also made this way to filter though the most prevalent engines while still not being COMPLETELY all gas. Your SYnchros really put in the work here, and can even be used for your XYZ and links once they fulfill their purpose. This is just a test, however, and personally, I think this is the second-best out of the three (I like Dangers, alright?). I might go with the Brave Token engine in the future, but for now I am focusing on Chaos Dragons."

The Sneks are cool, alright?! We can't all run Swordsoul and Floowandereeze!","The second variation of the Chaos Ogdoadic deck I made previously. This time, the deck contains a sort of Hieratic engine, only to promote tributes and special summons. This way, it is much easier to focus on searching Dragons (i.e. Levianeer) and going full combo without getting severely punished. It is also much easier to make an I:P Masquerena along with a Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres, because bouncing a card and getting an Apollousa on your opponent's turn seems pretty promising. The deck was also made this way to absorb impact from hand traps (i.e. D.D. Crow and Ash Blossom) while not being COMPLETELY all gas. Don't count your snakes out, either. Snake Rain + Water Lily is still a promising combo in this deck, as doing so turn 1 will leave more opportunities open (i.e. search Serpent Strike instead of 2nd Water Lily) to make a Hope Harbinger and Hyperyton."

Not an OP deck, but has consistency and be able to adopt many situations. Full-power board at","What you have to do with this deck is tryna get <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network in the first turn, the chance is pretty high as you have 3 </a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, 3 </a><a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, 1 </a><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> which easily help you get the field spell in the 1st turn. There's also 3 </a><a data-name=""Numeron Wall"">Numeron Wall</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, help you get the card into your hand if you didn't get it on your 1st turn, also help you negate the attacks from the opponents(don't worry if you didn't get them on your 1st turn, the other cards in the deck are </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, other negate and Eldlich traps will help you survive the 1st turn)
</a>

<a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Once you have </a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> on your hand, Xyz summon 4 Numeron Gates(try to OTK your opponent first if you can attack), Sp.Summon a link monster. I prefer </a><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, as it is the best link monster if you arre going first and he will give you a good hand(draw 4, shuffle 3 into the deck). Then do the following things, depends on what you draw:</a>
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Negate traps : set it on your field, end turn, tryna use them reasonably
</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Eldlich traps : set it on your field. Use them to Sp.Summon Eldlich the Golden Lord. If you still survive, you can keep Huaquero of the Golden Land and Conquistador of the Golden Land face-down, flip it at the opponent's end phase to get 2 level 5 material for Constellar Pleiades</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a> : Send <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Wyvern"">Red-Eyes Wyvern</a> to the GY to get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>. In case your <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> die, Red-Eyes Wyvern will banish himself to send <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> back to the field.</li>
</ul>
Turn 2 : Congrats on surviving the 1st turn. Now if you have both <a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> and </a><a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> on the field. Sp.Summon </a><a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> from the extra deck. Now you have 1 more powerful monster on the field. But this also mean, you can't use </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> on that turn(if you have the card on the hand), as the card doesn't allow you to Sp.Summon or Normal Summon the same turn that the spell is activated, you have to leave it until turn 3. But you can use materials on the field, for </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">. At this point </a><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread'"">'</a><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread's"">s</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network""> second effect maybe useful if he is still alive, use him and another sp.summoned monster by his effect to call out </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, then </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>

<a data-name=""Super Polymertization"">Super Polymertization</a> is for removing 1 opponent's boss monster at least to get <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, using <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">'s effect or the spell itself. Your most powerful board will have : 1 </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, 1 </a><a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, 1 </a><a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">, 1 </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a><a data-name=""Numeron Network"">(now he's wasted), some Eldlich and the boys.  Time to counter attack and smash your opponent, it will be hard for them to fight again this.</a>

The deck may not be the strongest deck. But the monsters are one of the coolest in the game, and I've been YGO-chilling with this deck for a few days and feel sooooo great and satisfying. You can also choose other cards in the side deck and replace them into the main deck, depends on your dueling style. Also help me improve this deck, as this is the first time of mine making a deck and it is needed to be improved. I appreciate all of your recommendation.

Enjoy the game Duelists. GET YOUR GAME ON!

P/S : I forgot to said that Eldlich cards can help you destroy or banish card on either field. Now that's another tool of card destruction. Read the card texts to know about these effects."
