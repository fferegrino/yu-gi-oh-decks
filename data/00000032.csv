Until then, I hope you're prepared to search an incredible amount, take advantage of the summon limit, and control the battlefield with pressure that makes control decks jealous of the hand advantage you can amass (although they've probably got us beat here when it comes to Traps and such-...) anyway here's the rundown of the new Dark Magician line-up!<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Snowball</strong>: You rack up advantage pretty quickly once you get going with this strategy. Between all of the layers of protection and nuance regarding the disruption lines on top of all of the means of searching from over a decade's worth of support? It's honestly difficult not to win after taking the lead.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Comeback Potential</strong>: Just having Illusion, Rod, Controlling the Dark Magician, or even just having Soul Servant in the GY during mid-to-late game will keep you in the game regardless of how things are going. Just don't play too zealously into something like a Trickstar Candina!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Rewarding Ceiling</strong>: While a lot of the early lines are pretty straightforward, most of the complexities with the archetype as a whole come from the usage of cards in tandem with one another. As opposed to early TCG builds where you kind of just drew cards and hoped it was enough to combo or amass a handtrap/backrow advantage, in Trinity, you'll be much more rewarded for your mastery of the cards at your disposal and how to best navigate the board you're dealt with or expecting. At times the pressure can be nigh suffocating from this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Possible to Brick</strong>: Unlike its TCG counterpart, due to the nature of the format, DM can't exactly take advantage of so much deck-thinning and draw power and while some cards like the Spellbook engine would help with the cycling process a bit, they will always be setting you a turn behind and adding more additional cards to cycle through in the long run. A brick doesn't necessarily equate to your searchers and passing, it's more of the unplayable circumstances of drawing... all of the Dark Magicians and having no way of summoning them. Hence why we've got some backrow to fall back on and ways to cheat him out in the event of a crisis.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong>: This particular list makes great use of Dark Magician Girl and cards concerning her (without playing the Magician Girl archetype of course) and as amazing as the cards surrounding her are, she herself is terrible to use. You'll be wanting to bin her whenever possible or simply control her when under gamestates like Magician's Combination. There's even a cheeky setup concerning Brain Controll (or Big Eye) and using her as Xyz material to go into Dhampir Sheridan. All of those applications aside, she (and her Signature Spell) aren't that great and don't feel that great to have until necessary for certain combos.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stat-Checked</strong>: If faced with too many monsters that are 3000 ATK/DEF or above you might run into a brick wall sometimes. You can tech in the Honests to get around this a bit better, but you'll need to hard draw those. Mahad can clear all things that are DARK and Apprentice can help the respective targets clear certain thresholds but most of the time those will be one use situations. Fortunately you can use Soul Servant to stack them from the GY to the top of deck for one final use.</li></ul><p>With introductions over, let's get into the setups you'll want to seek seek more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />Thanks to all of the years of support this archetype has received it has gained a number of searchers and retroactive searchers to help boost its consistency and lines of play to be very reliable which is a massive boon when it comes to limited formats like this one. Generally, any starter will net you the same gamestate no matter what goes down; however, there are some combinations of 2 or more cards that do require a bit more setup.</p><ul><li><strong>Manju &amp; Senju: </strong>Opening one of these cards enables you to grab Illusion of Chaos (or Sauravis if you already have it) then search Magicians' Souls. Using Souls you'll want to setup your GY with either Mana to protect your plays going down the line or DM/DMG to establish them early and get them in rotation for the later stages of the game. Then you'll pivot into either Dharc or Lyna. With Dharc you can grab <strong>Magikuriboh </strong>and use it during that same battle phase (or main phase later) to summon a Dark M agician immediately, <strong>Witch of the Black Forest</strong> if you have particularly greedy setup lines to go for in future turns with fusion plays or revival, or simply <strong>Magician's Rod</strong> who is the best starter in the deck when combined with other cards in the strategy and it's not even close! As for Lyna, <strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</strong> will be our primary find; however, <strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> isn't particularly bad either. The reason why is below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Diviner of the Herald:</strong> Using its effect to send, we'll pitch Arc Light from our Extra Deck to make it a Level 6 tuner, then we'll use Arc Light to grab Illusion of Chaos from the deck. Using Illusion, we'll pick up Magicians' Souls and send the appropriate targets like within the Manju &amp; Senju lines to the GY to summon it directly from the hand. Then we'll Synchro Summon itno <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. This card being a Level 7 who revives itself and answers the board during the SP is very handy for Rank 7 lines and getting rid of pesky monsters. It's worth noting that her banish effect to bring herself back does come up in this deck so don't use it willy-nilly. Banishing Souls is fine, but everything else in this list definitely is not. Use it within moderation as her effect can be used even on turns where she wasn't sent to the GY since it checks during each of their End Phase's. If you happen to need Rod and have a usable S/T at your disposal, you can summon her back, then use that S/T to tribute her and add back the Magician's Rod at EP to start your turn with your primary searcher. Very handy indeed.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Rod:</strong> This card probably has the highest ceiling regarding its uses since now, with Illusion of Chaos, it can search the entire archetype and its support including adding Dark Magician to the hand when necessary. You may also want to (if on the second turn or later) Link it off into Clara &amp; Rushka so that during the opponent's turn, when you activate an S/T, you can tribute the link to add Rod back to hand. One line I like to particularly setup involves using it as fusion material for <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> by grabbing <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>, that way in the event that the Fusion would be destroyed and I have a S/T I can use, I'd usually tribute away the Dark Magician girl to recycle Rod for next turn. You can also go for some pretty devastating Bond Between Teacher and Student setups when going second (or later in the game) to nuke your opponent's S/Ts or Monsters. It was this particular line of play that actually winded up getting <strong>Dark Burning</strong> <strong>Magic </strong>banned here. Oops.</li></ul><p>The majority of the time you'll want to stick to opening with one of these cards but if you happen to find yourself opening things like just DM or ways to him, it's still fine to cycle your respective S/Ts and support him as necessary. He's still the star of the deck and it's important to make sure you keep up your advantage until you can snowball the game out of controll.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where most games can end for you since the deck can swarm pretty decently after being setup or be rather controlling between Aruru and Mana being a devastating duo.</p><ul><li><strong>Bystial Baldrake: </strong>This card challenges most strategies with just its D.D. Crow effect; however, also being able to bin Dark Magicians, Rods, or resolved Manju/Senjus comes in handy for its tribute cost while still representing a lot of pressure. Additionally, it's a Dragon for a potential Fusion play into Dragon Knights and <em>finally</em>, it is a Level 6 that can be used to make Sheridan or Wollow to completely turn the game on its head proactively rather than reactively. If you can only banish out of your GY, then Servant, Mahad, and the Ritual Package should be fine banishes without any notable lasting consequences. You lose 1 draw for banishing out Palladiums but that's a sacrifice you have to make sometimes.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Eternal Soul: </strong>Don't flip this card too early without insurance, it immediately puts a target on itself and players usually try to remove it when its face-up every time. That said, it can revive DMs for free and search out your one-sided Heavy Storm whenever you want. Use it to secure a lead or establish one. The safest setup to use it under midgame is definitely when controlling <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> fusion monster, since if Eternal Soul leaves, the fusion would be destroyed but still float into the master and student, ultimately not setting you too far behind.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Soul Servant: </strong>This card's GY effect is rather potent and is virtually unrivaled when it comes to Unlimited power cards in Trinity Format. You'll usually be resolving it to draw two; however, with this build it's possible to draw up to four cards naturally from this effect- and we play TWO copies. The most important things to note about the stacking (and not searching) effect is that you can use it during the EP of your opponent's turn to rig your next draw and <em>the fact that this card can stack cards from your GY to the top of the deck</em> which is very, very potent in a limited format. Don't forget this as it might save you when piloting the deck!</li></ul><p>Should the game not end at this point and you find yourself in a complex, mind-boggling gamestate then you're probably going to want one of the following closers.</p><p><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight &amp; Eternal Soul: </strong>This combination is really rough to deal with, especially since S/T removal is very limited in Trinity, so if this is established you have virtually won. DMtDK is treated as DM so it can be revived by Eternal Soul and is constantly under its protection, additionally, Eternal Soul is protected by DMtDK's continuous effect, making this a really rough situation to navigate for the opponent in most cases. Additionally, since DMtDK is treated as DM, it works with the field spell <strong>Magician's Salvation</strong> and <strong>Magician's Combination</strong> so even something like a DMG can represent DMtDK coming back over and over while protecting said cards in the process. This card is a monster and needs to be respected when properly established.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Combination: </strong>Probably the most underrated support card this deck has at its disposal. You tag out your DM/DMG to their counterpart and negate any card or effect (just not the activation so no Damage Step shenanigans). Once the opponent has had enough and decides to blow up Combination, it even has a revenge effect to clear a card on their side of the field. You can also force this effect yourself with <strong>Timaeus the United</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Magicians' Souls </strong>turning those plays into removal.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Signature Move: </strong>Though these cards are often considered bad and I even think so most of the time myself, I cannot understate how potent their effects are when they resolve. In all of my history playtesting this deck in any iteration, the games in which the Signature Attacks of the duo have resolved have always resulted in my win. Whether that be the easily accessed <strong>Dark Magic Attack </strong>or the trickier to pull off <strong>Dark Burning Attack</strong> (though you can access it easier with Bond), the signature moves can really just blow away opponents regardless of their deck type and cut the game shorter than what they might have been expecting.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />Since the lines from the archetype itself are rather consistent, the deck can be easy to get started with, but might take a bit to get used to and master; however, it's usability allows a great deal of customizability to cater to most tech choices like Dragonmaids or the legal Bystials to establish DMtDK easier or SPYRAL to do Master Plan setups with Magicians' Souls. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>The Eye of Timaeus, Chaos Creator, Kashtira Monsters &amp; Birth, Magician of Dark Illusion, the remaining Bystials, Protecting Spirit Loagaeth, Noctovision Dragon, Mana Dragon Zimitron, Magician of Chaos, &amp; Chaos Form, Chicken Game, Destined Rivals, and Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous<br /></em><br />As always, if you've made it this far, thanks for checking this write-up out and combing over my iteration of the Dark Magician Starter. Once Chronicle Sorceress arrives you can rest assured that I'll be updating things with fresh lines and even more explosive combos since she increases the deck's consistency by a considerable margin. Until then, we'll just have to keep up a steady pace and recite the incantations of the ulimate wizard in terms of attack and defense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Of course, it's weak compared to the OCG 60 card version because we don't have Block Dragon or Grass for instance but we can still do some cool things like setting up a Savage Borreload Dragon and a Gallant Granite without a normal summon. Also, I once again included an Hop Ear Squadron (that we can search thanks to Cupid Pitch) to have more options + win in time. It is NOT a definitive deck list and it will definitely change when the next banlist is revealed around CYAC's release so please don't take for granted everything you see in here because we will have to adapt.</p>"

The Elemental HEROs and Neo-Spacians team up to bring justice.,"<p>This one's been another strategy that's been on the back burner of pet decks to boost to a somewhat competitive level while still maintaining its identity and not just falling prey to jamming in as many engines and broken backrow as possible to make it competitively viable. While this list isn't as refined as my World Chalice or Monarch builds of the past, it's been a blast to use and represents a ton of interesting gamestates with and without the use of Spirit of Neos who will potentially be retiring after this brief collaboration. Regardless, the core remains so I may as well document this while I have the opportunity, yeah?<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>OTK Potential</strong>: Fusion decks inherently have the advantage of being able to cheat the summon limit and jump straight into powerful boss monsters. Due to HEROs being pretty consistent with the over a decade worth of a support they have combined with all of the juicy warrior support cards means that the potential to just OTK from unexpected thresholds is real. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as high of a consistent threshold like Fluffal can be, but the potential can be theoretically higher depending on the hand.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reversal Potential</strong>: Shining Neos Wingman, Absolute Zero, Acid, Favorite Contact, and Miracle Fusion produce ridiculous levels of threat leaning closely to the presence that Vision HERO Trinity used to, without the need to cram three monsters into one.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Sky is the Limit</strong>: The starters can be pretty easy, but with the Neos and Neo-Spacian cards included, a lot of the lines can get pretty complicated. That aside, mastery of the list rewards creative synergies and ways of getting around pesky material restrictions for the extra deck lineup.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Minimal Disruption</strong>: This isn't HERO Beat, so we won't be naturally expecting to jam a guy, set five, and pass (though you can still play Hero Blast recycling Neos for a pretty hilarious payoff). We mostly aim to play through established boards and end the game fast. The less the better, but for some lines, like <strong>Brave Neos</strong>, it's better that your opponent at least control something. Most of the interaction we'll have are just ways to tag out our monsters, protect them, and remove backrow.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Neo Space</strong>: Despite Grand Mole and Aqua Dolphin having decent enough effects that can and should come up, they are objectively some of the worst cards in the deck and the deck does suffer for it. They are played as Aqua Dolphin is Unbound thanks to Marine always being treated as Dolphin and it being a WATER Warrior enables it to be a target for RotA and material for Absolute Zero. Grand Mole's just a pesky boy. Dark Panther's played for Nebula since its effect is incredible when it resolves but it is definitely able to be cut. We just need to have some space for Spacians for <strong>EN -&nbsp; Engage Neo Space</strong>. They also let us use Convert Contact... I guess?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Limited Xtra Options</strong>: The Extra Deck isn't too tight with cards like Nova Master and Grandmerge being expendable as an example; however, not too many adjustments can be made to make more room for Links (to use Neo-Spacians for) or more versatile Xyzs. This is mostly just a result of trying to maintain the core identity of the archetype rather than have most games just be decided by something like Claivesolish OTK.</li></ul><hr /><p><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />The hands can be pretty complicated to unravel, so I'll only really be breaking down some of the most relevant starters. It's worth noting that the fate of Spirit of Neos in a future banlist might change a lot of these lines, so heed caution.</p><ul><li><strong>The Classic: </strong>Having a way to turn HEROs into Sunrise and pick up Miracle is great and Sunrise while expressing a decent pop effect isn't all that important when it comes to modern Trinity standards. It is mostly just our way of resolving effects like Shadow Mist and Liquid without banishing them prior or having to waste Absolute Zero like one would in the past.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Engage... not that one:</strong> Engage Neo Space is a pretty interesting card that offers you the ability to send Shadow Mist directly to GY as cost or bin an early Aqua Dolphin for Miracle Fusion setups and immediately beam out either Spirit of Neos or the OG Vanilla. The target only really matters for maintaining minimum summons for a play; however, if you go into Spirit of Neos, you can resolve the effect for Favorite or Instant Contact then tag out into OG Vanilla Neos to use as a material for something like Brave Neos on an attacking turn. Couple that with Stratos or Mist being able to search back the shuffled Spirit as a ""defensive"" search during the opponent's turn makes Engage a fairly potent card. Just gotta have the respective card in hand to activate it.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Spirit:</strong> Outside of the aforementioned lines, if you can just access this card through something like Stratos, Mist, or E Call can have a way of summoning it prior to resolving stuff like Engage, you can seriously snowball your advantage and broaden the scope of your searches. On the opponent's turn, you'll be wanting to pick up Instant Contact most of the time; however, Favorite Contact's a safer line, albeit slower. Using Instant Contact, we can cheat out all of our potent, searcher Fusions or if we already have access to a fusion method like Polymerization, then we can summon Flame Wingman (or reveal it for Over Fusion) to fusion summon <strong>Shining Neos Wingman</strong>. Yes, all of this is from Spirit of Neos... as an opener. Fast right?</li></ul><p>You'll want to assess your removal and interaction by estimating how many turns it should take you to conclude the duel. Since we aren't on a lot of recursion or that amazing <strong>Legacy of a Hero</strong> card, we can't go too late game. Most plays are one-and-done, so make them count!</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />If you're struggling to break even, you can use the following lines to tip the game into your favor.</p><ul><li><strong>Fallen Mist: </strong>If Shadow Mist was sent to the GY in a prior turn, pick up Liquid Soldier, and use him to resurrect Mist and grab Mask Change. This gives you the ability to threaten Acid for Fast Effect Harpie's Feather Duster that also lowers ATK or pivot into Xtra HERO Wonder Driver and use Mist to grab Spirit of Neos. If the opponent attacks, you can summon Spirit at Link Point under Wonder Driver and recycle a fusion method. If they simply just pop Wonder Driver instead, you can still use the float effect to summon Neos anyway just in case they plan to play it safe and have you summon Spirit. The option of a Rank 4's also always on the table when it comes to Liquid Mist, but a comfortable line is simply using Liquid to resummon Stratos. Judge the gamestate and decide if you can use the Spell/Trap destruction effect, a search isn't always needed to close out games in Trinity.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Pretty Good</strong><strong>:</strong> Liquid and Cross Keeper cycling comes up a lot. Not just for ways to close out the game easier, but also for the limited Traps we're on in this build. Almost all of them stand to end the game way faster than your opponent might expect and you showing off flashy combos from yours truly will have them respecting your backrow less and less, especially if you set Polymerization as a bluff.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Brave Neos: </strong>Use this the same way you would <strong>Spirit of Neos</strong>, but proactively through its destruction by battle, as opposed to reactively when being attacked. This card usually forces interaction on it, so be ready to trade resources. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Omni HERO: </strong>Absolute Zero, The Shining, and Nova Master are our HEROs for the job in this build. Nova Master's great in simplified gamestates, Absolute Zero's the most notable in most gamestates, and The Shining's great for looping things either banished by the opponent or by you for a Miracle Fusion (including its materials).<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Core Convergence:</strong> While <strong>Elemental HERO Core</strong> might seem like a weird choice and one you won't be summoning a lot, it makes a great late game Miracle Fusion target as it can be used to resummon <em>any </em>HERO Fusion previously used in the duel. This is great for Brave Neos but particularly for Sunrise as Sunrise triggers on any Special Summon, not just proper Fusion Summon.</li></ul><p>The games shouldn't go too long; however, in the event that does happen these are some decent options for closing things out immediately.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shining Neos Wingman: </strong>A protected card that pops things on summon and gains scaling attack based on the cards in your GY <em>and</em> burns the opponent after a battle concludes? This thing goes absolutely wild and is an incredible ender accessed through Over Fusion and Instant Contact. Polymerization's the risky way to getting to it and I recommend holding at least one Miracle Fusion for making this as a finale since you'll be able to do it as the first summon and still have room for more after the way's been cleared.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Grandmerge: </strong>Using two Neos', you can use the battle tag to go into quite literally any Fusion in the Extra Deck. If you don't see an easy line to game, I recommend tagging out into <strong>Nebula Neos</strong> and drawing a ridiculous amount of cards. You can then choose to negate itself (and still get the draw) so it doesn't return to the Extra at End Phase, or negate something else. For this same reason, <strong>Contrast HERO Chaos </strong>can be a great option since it's always treated as an Elemental HERO.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>HENSHIN!: </strong>The Mask Change options in this list aren't as snowbally as something like Anki; however, they are still rather potent. Turning your LIGHT beatsticks into Koga and using Koga to steal games is a great option that can go under most people's radar as you don't really represent any Mask Changes in this deck.</li></ul><hr /><p><br />It's not expected that the Spirit of Neos lines will last forever, but after testing without the card and just opting for a second copy of Brave Neos or Engage, it'll ultimately be fine, just not the explosive threat that it currently is. Regardless, due to the number of lines offered through Engage, Stratos, Mist, and Spirit of Neos alike, the following are great considerations for shaking up the deck:<br /><br /><em>Predaplants &amp; Chaos Monsters, Super Polymerization, Dark Magician &amp; Dark Cavalry, Rank 7s like Big Eye to summon through Spirit of Neos and Instant Contact, Infernoble Knights &amp; Burstinatrix, Fallen of Albaz, Skyscraper II - Hero City (trust me). <br /><br /></em>Thanks for reading this far if you have. The viability of this deck likely won't last in the same condition it currently exists in, but with Honest Neos, Neos Fusion, DPE, and Vyon being out of the picture, I imagine there is likely more to be expected when it comes to hitting this archetype once Maze of Memes rolls in and we get Wake Up. For the time being though, I'll continue to just play and build whatever I want, since that's what's fun about Trinity for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Flare Wingman - Infernal Rage and Shining Neos Wingman","<p>As the name implies, this deck is a shout-out to Chainsaw Man. No more spoilers, but Denji's friend Pochita is not only the Chainsaw Devil, but is also called the ""Hero of Hell."" I understand that it would have been more thematically appropriate to use Elemental HERO Wildedge, but it's honestly mid. Sure, it can attack all monsters the opponent controls once each, but if its ATK was 3000, this effect would be better. In addition to that, Wildedge doesn't deal piercing damage, nor does it have effects that increase or descrease ATK/DEF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, this deck can go second due to having 6 hand traps and 3 Forbidden Droplets. As for Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage, it's good going first or second, since if can search Favorite Contact, and tribute itself to summon Elemental HERO Sunrise if Neos was used as Fusion Material. If you go first, you can use this combo to search Favorite Contact and disrupt the opponent's board with Shining Neos Wiseman.

Dinosaur King is your destiny, yeah!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Childhood nostalgia aside, I'm glad Konami tried to revitalize Dinosaurs with the Transcendrake archetype. Not only does Ground Xeno let you search a normal Dino or a Dino tuner, but it also pops a card in your hand and lets you do a Fusion Summon. Plus, the archetype incentivizes you to play Level 4 and 6 Dinosaur Normal monsters that you might like. Gigantozowler, Drillgnathus, and Glaciasaurus are all references to 3 of those monsters that I mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So not only does Transcendrake give Dinos a leg up, but it also gives you a reason to take Megalosmasher X or Kabazauls out of your binder. This deck has 8 hand traps, a Called By The Grave, and Pot of Prosperity, so it can do fine going first or second. As for this deck's name, ""Kyoryu"" is the Japanese word for ""Dinosaur"", and ""<span>ō"" being the Japanese word for ""King.""&nbsp;</span></p>"

Gryphon Rider helps out vs. cards that would end your turn mid-combo like Nibiru. Another good bait is first using Kashtira Fenrir, since it searches for Kashtira Scareclaw, an excellent extender for the archetype. Fenrir's search isn't needed for the combo making it perfect bait for an Imperm, Ash, etc.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Scareclaw primarily functions as a turn 3 OTK deck just like Salamangreat and Tri-Brigade - Set up interruptions and board presence on the first turn, disrupt your opponent as much as possible on turn 2, then on turn 3 you OTK as you clear their board and attack for game with Tri-Heart and Accesscode.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you're going second, (depending on your hand and current gamestate) you can either immediately go for the kill or build your board after you clear your opponent's. This deck has a myriad of ways to clear boards such as Rite of Aramesir (bounce with Dracoback), Nadir Servant (pop with by sending N'Tss), Primal Planet Reichphobia (pop with 3 DEF position monsters). Monsters such as Tri-Heart, Accesscode, Fenrir and Lava Golem (searchable with Small World!) also clear boards of problematic cards.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><br /><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal"">The best baits for interruption before you start your main Scareclaw combo are the Adventure cards and Kashtira Fenrir. It forces your opponent to use their Ash or negate on board, allowing you to fully combo off!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck easily second and either OTK or establish a board. When going second, think whether you can go for lethal or equalize the board state enough where you're ahead in resources so you can finish off your opponent for the next turn.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">When siding out cards, the best cards to exhange are 1 copy of each Scareclaw, Dogmatika Punishment and Scareclaw Twinsaw. </li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck can also use Super Polymerization reliably to clear boards, especially with Garura. (I just didn't use it for this deck build since the meta right now are Kashtira and Labyrinth, which are fairly immune to Super Poly).</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Another card this deck can use for extra consistency is Pot of Prosperity, since the only Extra Deck monsters you truly need are Light-Heart and Tri-Heart.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">If you're going first, and you think your opponent is going to board wipe you, don't commit all your resources in your hand to the board. Just have enough board presence were you can survive until next turn and swing back the game in your favour.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Board breakers like Lava Golem and Kurikara are very searchable with Small World. Both are very situational, and they can reliably out an established board so you can do your plays.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Extreme consistency means more staple cards and supplimentary engines like Dogmatika can be stuffed into this already strong deck. Synergy with the Adventure Engine means that Scareclaw can reliably play through the all-too-common and devastating Nibiru, a card that destroys almost every strategy in today's meta!</p><p>With all the support Scareclaw has received the past couple main sets and how the recent banlists worked out, they now have reached critical mass to competitively viability. The question is, does Scareclaw earn itself a worthwhile spot among its stronger Visas Starfrost lore siblings - Tearlaments, Kashtira and Manadome? Only time will tell. Time to pilot the deck to find out!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It was one of my first two decks I went for on MD with Eldlich, because I also love zombies.&nbsp; They were strong enough in season 1 to get me to gold but that is where Eldlich had to take over.&nbsp; With Rikka support, this deck can evolve into a field clearing XYZ powerhouse.</p><p>I run 2 Rikka Petal and 3 Lonefire Blossom for consistency.&nbsp; Once both Petals are in the GY, you can only use one per turn, so if you want to remove one, you can, but between these 5 cards, it makes for a very easy time getting your first petal on the field/GY to go into Snowdrop The Rikka Fairy.&nbsp; A lot of this deck revolves around Snowdrop.&nbsp; Snowdrop will allow you to mimic a cards level and change all cards on your field to that level.</p><p>Foolish Burial is amazing here.&nbsp; It is an extra way to get Petal into the GY if you don't draw Petal, Lonfire, or Snowdrop.&nbsp; If you don't need to get to Petal, it can be used to mill out Spore, Carrotweight, or Rose Lover.&nbsp; Carrotweight is best milled when you already have Spore or Rose in hand.&nbsp; This lets you get a free level 4 on the field and gives you a resource in the GY to summon from hand or set up for XYZ summon with Spore.&nbsp; Carrotweight can be brought down to a single copy in favor of Ash, Fengli, or Called by the Grave.</p><p>Sekka's Light x2 is something I am still playing with, but it is a strong card and not very punishing if you need to use it.&nbsp; Between the two copies, you can draw 4 cards and re draw 2.&nbsp; Try to save them for after you have used Foolish and Miracle Fertilizer if you can, but this is not necessary if you need the draw 2.&nbsp; These can also be swapped for Called by Grave, Miracle, or Ash.</p><p>Miracle is really strong with XYZ as well.&nbsp; It beats out Monster Reborn because it can special summon across multiple turns.&nbsp; It consumes your normal summon, but this isn't an issue.&nbsp; It's true power comes from summoning XYZ material.&nbsp; It reads, ""If a monster Special Summoned by this effect leaves the field, destroy this card;"" however, if you use that special summoned monster as XYZ material, it never left the field and it is no longer special summoned by Miracle, so detaching to GY does not destroy it.</p><p>Rose Archer is a bit of more fluid in this deck, but I run it because it works really well with plants and it is a very budget card.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can run Ash, Effect Veiler, Maxx ""C"", Ogre, or Imperm.&nbsp; Archer is also a great hand trap to combat the Imperms.</p><p>Evil Thorn could be worked out for something else, but it makes an easy way to summon Princessprite.&nbsp; Turn one with Petal can search Snowdrop, tribute Petal, summon Snowdrop and Thorn, then activate Thorn and summon the other two from the deck.&nbsp; Use Snowdrop to set their levels to 8 and summon Teardrop the Rikka Queen off of the Thorns leaving Snowdrop in def.</p><p>Using the first part of Snowdrop locks you into plant special summons, but if it survives, next turn you can set another monster to 8 and XYZ Number 97 and XYZ 97 into Number 92 if needed.&nbsp; Otherwise Number 107 and Hieratic are strong non-plant options.&nbsp; Just remember that if there are no plants on the field, Rose Archer is useless.</p><p>Dark Armed, The Dragon of Annihilation is currently in the deck, but it doesn't see much play and could be swapped for something else.&nbsp; It is a little tricky to get out as it requires at least 1 Dark XYZ to be in GY and then Snowdrop another dark monster to level 5+, but it creates a strong 1 cost XYZ.&nbsp; Alternatively, Number 87 is a strong base attack with ok effects option but has a high cost of 3 level 8 monsters.&nbsp; There is also Sacred Tree Beast which has a strong effect, but cost 2 level 9 monsters.&nbsp; This requires to Spore off one of the 4 level 8's in the deck and isn't the easiest summon, but sets up a great negate and has easy material generation.</p><p>Other Side Deck options are there as some decent swaps to the more flexible cards in the deck.&nbsp; If you want to run 3 Ash, I would personally take out 1 Cherubsprout, Carrotweight, and either a Gaurdioak or Miracle.&nbsp; Play around and let me know what you think!</p>"

With Cyberstein added, I can also add a layer of negation with Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon, or commit some foolery with Depsia Proskenion or Invoked Purgatrio (if I main deck Book of Eclipse).

Getting Haine out also protects all of these except Mechaba from being target by effects, and the Dogmatika engine leaves you with Fleurdelis in hand for an extra hand trap. Since most of your monsters are spellcasters, Vice-Madame is proccing off of them to add more resources to hand or special summon an extra monster to field.

A lot has changed since last time.</p><p>Handtrap line up consists of Nibiru, purely because it's one of the best handtraps to deal with Kashtira provided they don't run Iblee/Crossout/Adventurer. And still has utility against anything Bystial/Dragon Link related. Ash Blossom is also a must i feel. Being able to deal with cards such as Branded Fusion is absolutely key, and Impermenence because of it sheer utility.&nbsp;</p><p>The Striker engine itself doesn't really need to be explained too much, as pretty much everybody who has played in the last few years is more than aware of what it can do. Linkage is an awesome addition to the deck allowing you to kill off your opponent a lot faster making the deck less reliant on the Accesscode Talker package to close out games. Pot Of Prosperity, Avarice, ROTA and Terraforming allow the deck to grab what it needs and wants, and in Avarice's case recycle the ED monsters in case the game becomes grindy and also to alleviate the loss of ED monsters with Prosperity's effect. Harpie's, Evenly, Thrust and Talents aid the deck in being able to break boards. My tech card of choice is none other than Herald Of The Abyss. This card is actually really good in a format. Being able to out things like Shangri-Ira/Arise Heart, while circumventing the effects of Forbidden Lance and inbuilt destruction protection is a real premium. It also is very good at being able to out untargetable/unkillable/unaffected by card effects boss monsters that are typically the bane of Striker's existence as Herald affects the player, not the card. This is vital for the Labrynth matchup in particular to deal with Lady Labrynth, as that cannot be targeted or destroyed whilst there are set traps on the field.&nbsp; Other monsters such as Avramax,/Arrival Cyberse/Mirrorjade/Dragoon also fall to Herald as well, making it incredibly versatile in rogue matchups or for Jade/Dragoon in Branded.</p><p>The side deck consists of Lava Golem, as the deck has enough methods now to get to your ED monsters with Linkage, Area Zero, Drones so as to not need to heavily rely on your normal summon as much. I'm currently testing out both Lancea and Droll, so they could interchange. Cosmic Cyclone because Anti-Spell Fragrance has seen an uptake in the side deck due to the Kashtira spells often being critical for them to make the plays they require, and I don't feel like using Twisters due to the discard cost. Solemn to say no to anything that hits my backrow, D-Barrier for the meta decks and the final copy of Evenly to round it off nicely.</p>"

Burning Abyss has been competitive in the past, but I wanted to make a casual deck that uses all the B.A. cards with no full sets and staple cards outside the strategy.</p><p>My rules are to make sure to include as many archtype cards as possible. Avoid full playsets so decks are not super consistent. Include a few staples (Ash, Maxx, etc) for interaction. Possibly include another archtype (or their staples) if they have synergy. &nbsp;</p><p>Any suggestions to make this deck more fun and at a similar power level with modern structures decks would be appreciated.</p>"

Not the craziest or most well constructed deck or whatever but I think it's fun! Many discard to draw cards to get your monsters in the GY so you can start summoning your Necrofears! Venom dragons are used also to get more monsters in the GY just like Wee Witch's Apprentice and generally I just simply found them to be super useful monsters to have on the field. Your Necrofears have plenty of card removal on their own and Curse Necrofear's removal gets better with more Destiny Board Letters on the field! I would appreciate some advice or critique on this deck! All comments are appreciated and I thank you for the time you spent checking this deck out!</p>

Have i got the deck for you.<br /><br />P.u.n.k Pride is a deck that squarely fits into the T1.5 metaspace. It's concistent and powerful, with only 1 or 2 carsd missing from making the deck Tier 1. It has an extremely favorable mashup against both Labirynth and Kashtira, and has mechanics that are very hard to play around for nearly every deck. P.u.n.k. Pride is skillful and is not just a 1 card pony trick that can easily be thwarted by negates. It's the perfect deck for those that want a differnt choice this 02/2023 TCG Format.<br /><br />This deck list is ""Loosely"" based off of a list made by MBT for one of his Ten Minute Testing videos. However, for this build i did make some changes, as i did not like some of the card choices when doing playtesting:<br /><br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Dangerous Gabu: When running the deck, i found myself never really wanting to draw this card or use it.<br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Madame Spider: Since we are running no P.U.N.K Traps, we have no need to run this card.</p><p>- Psy-Frame Negate Package (x3 Psy-Frame Gear Beta + x1 Psy-Frame Driver): Drive is such a bad garnet, and i found that ash blossom worked much better here.

I know certian builds are running 2-3 copies as E-tele targets but they tend to brick as trhe deck does not need more tuners. This in future may just become another ash blossom.<br /><br />In the extra, i cut nearly all of the Link Monsters, keeping only Gold Pride Star Nytro Head. When playtesting, i never went into any of the Links, and i rarely ever go into Star Nytro head. Star Nytro Head does have purpose for being fodder for Carrie's ability, and making Star Leon bigger, but depending on whether new support comes out in may, this card may or may not stay in the deck.<br /><br />I also removed some of the Synchros, and swapped them out for either more copies of&nbsp; key pieces (+ x1 <a class=""type-synchro-monster"" href=""/card/?search=60465049"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/60465049.jpg"" data-card=""60465049"" data-name=""Psychic End Punisher"">Psychic End Punisher</span></a> ) to help combat against Kashtira, or swapped out for cards that provided some more utiliity:</p><p>+ x1 Crystron Phoenix as an out against Labrynth Decks. Summon this to blank their backrow and graveyard, assuming they have no already activated Skill Drain. This is an effect that could see increased value if the new 1 card Super Heavy Samurai combo takes off in the TCG like it has in the OCG.this also marginally good against other decks, but is not the main goto.</p><p>+ x1 Stellar WInd Wolfrayet as an out against Kashtira. This is not super easy to go into, but non-targeting shuffle into deck is extremely poweful and very few if any decks can actually play around it. The effect is very easy to pull off as most decks need to activate 4-5 effects minimum to get into anything meaningful. And P.u.n.k. Pride can easily take the game on the crackback.<br /><br />+ x1 Hyper Psychic Riser...

This in essence could be any level 6 synchro, but this one does have some annoying properties that can make it hard for cards to go off, and is one of those cards that hurts your opponents more than it hurts you. Also, this can be an intermediary to level 9 synchros if needed. Technically,. if your store/group allowed it, you could run the Japanese Copy from Duel Disk Yusei, which on Ebay is ~$20 USD, bu your deck would not be tournament legal.<br /><br />The sideboard is subjective, and was largely just based off of the existing board list MBT made.

Getting two Recital Starlings out will get you two more Lyrilusc, and when you finish with both of them, you can use them both to go into Utopic Future and Utopic Draco Future; Assembled Nightingale can deal damage and protect your other Lyrilusc from destruction/effects; Ensemblue Robin can floodgate a few Special Summons; Promenade Thrush can take care of Traps/Spells as well as provide a boost to Attack when you want to push for game. Tri-Brigade just helps cycle through your deck and can act as backup if your board gets wiped by using their ability to go into their Link monsters. If you want to win more, send one of your XYZs into Zeus during Main 2 to ensure your opponent's board gets wiped. Evil Thorn just gives you a free Rank 1 XYZ if its ability goes through in exchange for your Normal Summon, although possibly without the protection that using your Lyrilusc cards give.</p><p>For Side Deck, you've got your hand traps and other removal if you want to counterpick based on what your opponent is using. Also using a high-attack Kaiju rather than Gameciel, since you can crash Recital Starling into it for very high damage.</p><p>If you're going first, an optimal end board is Utopic Draco Future, Assembled Nightingale, and Ensemble Robin. Utopic Draco can block a monster effect and Robin floodgates a minimum of two Special Summons, while Nightingale will protect itself and Robin from destruction with one material used. If going second, depending on your opponent's board setup, you have the potential to OTK. Get Assembled Nightingale on the board with as many materials as possible, and either Recital Starlings if you can safely crash for game-ending damage, Utopic Future to steal a resistant boss monster, or Utopic Draco Future to block monster effect.</p>"

Rogue or Stun, decks that can take on the meta need to be made in order to put a check in the game. However as we learned many times, Tier-0 decks can exist regardless of their weaknesses. Which is why today I rather ""exported"" an interesting Stun deck from the Eastern Hemisphere. The card ""Fary Tail - Luna"" is a card while on the field can return any monster (and itself) to the hand (unless it can't ve targeted). Then there is the Kaiju archetype: an archetype that can have one monster be tributed on your opponents side, and special summoned on your side. What synergy do they have? TL;DR give a Kaiju to your opponent, summon Luna, and return both of them to your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The twist with this however is that I am also running the Runick engine. I'm not gonna go into details about them, but the archetype has spells that have Kino effects in exchange for giving up your battle phase. Alongside a field spell that plays them from your hand anytime and recovers them from the GY to the deck, Runick has a lovely will spot in the Yu-Gi-Oh Stun Deck lore. How I combined all three of them is by using the Kaijus and ""Fairy Tail - Luna"" to destabilize your opponents board, and using the Runick spells to your best use and to mill resources from your opponents deck.</p>"

After taking this to locals and getting the advice of many experienced Runick players I ended on this list. You need to have 17-19 Runick Quick Play Spells in order to have consistent draws off of Runick Fountain. The main strategy is to switch between both Runick and Sky Striker cards to control the gamestate. The Runick cards should not only be used to control the game, but to summon Runick monsters from the extra deck to stop an opponents attack. You will be winning most of the time by decking out your opponent but you can also win by killing your opponent with Sky Striker monsters and especially BLS which most decks cannot out.&nbsp;</p>"

I think this might be the best positioning for the card, but even then it doesn't do a ton. Try to flip it quickly with Disturbance Strategy or Mind Wipe during your opponent's turn (NOT DURING THEIR DRAW STEP) and hopefully catch their Pot of Greeds and Graceful Charities. Once you have a couple appropriates on line you should be able to quickly draw out your entire deck and win with Exodia in hand.&nbsp;</p>"

The main goal here is to work the two parts together to create a board of heavy hitters that can overwhelm your opponent. Cards like Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment can help get your combos started, being able to get certain Gate Guardian pieces in play or into the graveyard, and fetching Branded Fusion or Branded in Red. The Gate Guardian monsters (Namely Gate Guardians Combined and Gate Guardian of Wind and Water) can help protect your monsters from various targeting and spell/trap effects, while Mirrorjade can deal with monsters by banishing them or destroying them if it leaves the field. Despian Quaeritis and Gate Guardian of Water and Thunder can reduce a monster's attack points to stop them from attacking your monsters as well as help trigger Labyrinth Wall Shadow's destruction ability. There is also the possibility of using Blazing Cartesia to go into Granguignol the Dusk Dragon which in turn can get you into one of Quaeritis or even Luluwalilith. Overall the deck works a lot better than I thought it would, but it is vulnerable to being interrupted, and if a board is broken, it's not the easiest to recover.</p>"

Usually if the opponent is able to get pass your P.U.N.K combo, Thunder Dragons' amazing recylability will net the win. Work in progress, the extra deck is iffy with Zombie Vampire (used to have more Thunder Dragons I could special if milled) and really not sure about psy-frame hand trap, unless you have enough material for Lambda, because it can basically be a brick. Admittedly, shotgun Maxx C or Ash into a free Chaos Ruler is very nice when the time comes. Also might switch Allure for Chicken Game, but the last couple of games have been spright outting my board and I only have ~5k life points after doing the PUNK combo so I'm unsure. Fun deck all the same, Thunder Dragons and PUNKs are definitely in my top 3 archetypes so I love to use them together.</p>"

The first is important once you have to use destruction Venus to recover your shineballs and the second is simply due to there being many combolines that potentially allow you to bait many handtraps or ressources and still get to a decent endboard.</li><li>With a decent hand you will generally have extra shineballs to make I:P Masquerena and the other Extras, while the minimum endboard is generally Masterflare, Elf and a synchro 10.&nbsp;</li><li>You will notice that the Countertrap search often has to be ditched inorder to get the extenders you need, but usually thats alright, if you can fill your hand with Orangelight or other handtraps.</li><li>Considering Runick is heavily played, I tend to go for Chengying instead of Baronne, if i can end on the Counter Trap or a Herald of the Arc Light to have <strong>at least </strong>1 omni negate.</li><li>The Ishizu cards are basically there to serve as 1. Link fodder if you can special summon them 2. Tribute fodder for Trias for the card draw 3. Filling the GY with Diviner, Majesty, Trias, Eva or Neptune 4. Reshuffling your own Shine Balls to keep extending 5. Get a peak at what the opponent is playing.</li><li>Once you have Neptune in Hand your mills become your second hand since you can special summon any Agent you milled.</li><li>Sadly the deck bricks every now and then, which is just natural if you play 3 Garnets and the mills can go wrong if you need them to hit well, but it just happens from time to time.</li><li>The interaction between Orange Light and Eva will many times give you the starter or extender you need.</li><li><strong>Handtraps:</strong> The deck <em>can</em> bait many Handtraps - especially with the Ishizu cards (many ash the millers and if they dont the mills can be useful) BUT it can die to an <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a>&nbsp;or <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59438930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59438930.jpg"" data-card=""59438930"" data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</span></a>&nbsp;if your hand doesn't have any follow up.

Basically, access to Isolde and a Level 5 Synchro is fully combo for the Deck and the plays are pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>2&nbsp;<strong>Super Quantum Red Layer</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Neo Space Connector</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong> to get to Isolde. 2<strong> Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong> which is a monster negate and it is very easy to Summon. You don't need to search it as you have pretty much enough interruption in your basic combo already, but it is another addition to your end-board if you do happen to draw it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for extension. 3 <strong>Infernoble Knight - Oliver</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ogier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Renaud</strong>. Renaud is great for extension, as a Summon off of Isolde, and he can grab back something like <strong>Living Fossil</strong> for more extension. Oliver is another extender and he can make himself into an equip which is important for this Deck. Ogier has more usage with the new Infernoble support, so having something that can foolish an equip or a FIRE Warrior is great with the new grave effects. Also, he can also make himself an equip which is important as we need at least 1 monster who can make themselves an equip in our starting combo. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ricciardetto</strong>. Drawing him is fine as he can basically make Isolde pretty easily depending on your starting hand if you do draw him, but he is also a pretty good Summon off of Isolde as well since he can reborn a FIRE Warrior on summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Turpin</strong> which is a free summon from hand or GY if you control an equip and he can also make himself an equip.</span></p><p><span>For Spells and Traps, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> to search our stuff. 3<strong> Infernoble Arms - Durendal</strong>, 2<strong> Infernoble Arms - Almace</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Arms - Joyeuse</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Infernoble Arms Museum</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade,&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Living Fossil</strong>. Durendal searches a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior. Almace can equip a different Infernoble Arms from Deck. Joyeuse can add back a FIRE Warrior from GY. Noble Arms Museum searches a Noble Arms card and specials a Noble Knight that is currently an equip.</span></p><p><span>ED: 1&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fluer</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Angelica, Princess of Noble Arms</strong>, 1 <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Charlemagne</strong>. Ricciardetto does Warrior lock you if you use his effect on Summon, and because you will be using that effect most of the time, you can't really play much outside of Warriors in your Extra Deck. If you aren't Warrior locked, you can make Masquerena with your extra bodies to go into Avramax or Unicorn. Angelica seraches Noble Arms Museum and if she is targeted, she can banish herself until the End Phase to foolish a FIRE Warrior from Deck and summon Captain Roland from your Extra Deck. You can target her with the effects of your Infernobles in GY that allows them to make themselves equips which then gets you to the rest of your combo. Charlemagne basically is another Charles after he equips Charles using his effect on Link Summon. Then, you can Summon your equipped Charles using Noble Arms Museum to have another body on field.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck can be whatever, but I would recommend board clearers and backrow removal for going second.</span></p><p><span>Full combo is simple: Make Isolde using whatever and dump Living Fossil to Summon out Ricciardetto. Ricciardetto revives a Level 4 non-Tuner FIRE Warrior which can be put into your GY through something like Ogier or Oliver. Synchro into Angelica and search Noble Arms Museum. Museum pay 1200 to add whatever Noble Arms you need or are missing. An Infernoble in GY targets Angelica to try to equip, and then chain Angelica to banish herself, dump Turpin, and Summon Captain Roland. Then, you can equip an Equip Spell to Roland so that you can Summon back Turpin. Synchro into Charles and equip Roland to him. Link that off into Charlemagne and effect to copy effects and equip Charles. Museum Summon out the equipped Charles. End Phase Angelica returns. If you were not Warrior locked, then you can get more bodies on field to make Masquerena, but it all depends on what you open.</span></p>"

Youtube Link inside!,"<div class=""elementToProof"">Branded currently is one of the top contenders for today's March 2023 meta. Able to consistently make gigantic fusion beatsticks with board clearing capabilities backed by a solid resource grindgame, Branded is currently the ultimate aggro-beatdown deck. Pushed into meta relevance by Konami because of it's fan favourite status as the ""lore"" deck of series 12, Branded post Photon Hypernova is a fusion powerhouse! </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">However, this Branded suffers from two major weaknesses: Ash Blossom (On esp. on Branded Fusion) and Nibiru. This version of Branded aims to fix that, by giving the pilot so much gas and plays to work with so that you can play through those devastating handtraps and eventually out-resource your opponent! This ""gas"" variant of Branded can keep playing, even though Branded Fusion is negated! Some hands allow the pilot to make Dragoon before you use Branded Fusion (so you can negate Ash) and before 5 summons (so you can negate Nibiru). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Dragoon is especially strong in today's meta vs. many meta decks since they all target/destroy, meaning this overpowered Deviantart OC is a nigh-invincible instant-win button!</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></p></div></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">This core of this deck is composed of the traditional <strong>Branded </strong>and <strong>Despia </strong>cards. The only card that isn't standard is <strong>Dramaturge</strong>. I personally like to use Dramaturge since he can negate Mirrorjade if you're going first, which enables 2 uses of Mirrorjade's effect rather then 1 - thus getting you more dumps in the GY from the ED and more resources. 3 <strong>Tragedy</strong> is included as a banish target for Allure of Darkness (essentially a +1!). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Bystial package</strong> is relatively small, since banishing Light/Dark monsters in the GY isn't very impactful and common in today's metagame. Lubellion is ""searcheable"" from deck since Branded Fusion dumps him to the GY,and Lubellion can summon itself from the GY by tributing the on-field Albion. Lubellion can activate from deck <strong>Branded Lost</strong> as extra protection/search power or <strong>Branded Beast</strong> for a quick effect pop during the main phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Frightfur package</strong> is included as another piece of ""gas"" in the deck - maintaining hand advantage since all the pieces search each other and giving access to Polymerization (a powerful boardbreaker with Guardian Chimera).</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> functions as a toolbox in this deck, since its 3 targets each serve a distinct function. <strong>Albaz </strong>can breakboards when summoned, and Albaz + Super Poly cracks most boards nowadays. If your opponent happens to field Dragon monsters, Albaz can contact fuse them away. <strong>Cartesia </strong>enables fusion summoning as a quick effect. Not only does she give access to Granguinol (which is a foolish burial), she can protect your activating monster effects on the field from targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. Finally, <strong>Dark Magician</strong> can be summoned from deck if you have all the pieces for Dragoon, so that you can have access to his omni-negate to deter Ash/Nibiru before you full combo. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">50 cards are utilized in this deck rather than around 40ish since every important piece (esp. Branded Fusion) is highly searcheable anyways. 50 cards also reduces the likelihood of drawing garnets and bricks. This ""gas"" version of Branded is designed to draw alot, search alot, and to play alot to overwhelm any sort of interaction your opponent has whether it is Ash Blossom, Nibiru or on-board interruption. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">""Gas"" Branded is designed to play through your opponent's interruption to create gigantic fusion beatsticks and overwhelm with high ATK and massive resource generation. If given even a second of breathing space, your opponent will find that they are facing down a field full of powerful fusion monsters!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Branded Fusion is both a blessing and a curse for this strategy. The whole deck revolves around searching and resolving that card, and if it's negated, your further options are likely limited. Your obvious glaring chokepoint and weakness is Branded Fusion, so it is imperative that you can bait out the Ash Blossom or fusion summon Dragoon before you use the card. It is advisable to use every other card first like Frightfur Patchwork, Branded Opening or Lubellion so that you can bait out your opponent's Ash Blossom. Also, from experience playing the deck, I've discovered that people intentionally hold their Ash Blossom saving it for Branded Fusion - so if you don't have the card, you can bluff having it and just do all your searches/summons from deck!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">End boards are very hand dependant, but here are the mainline combos: </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><em>Branded Fusion + Dark Monster + Discard = Mirrorjade (banish), Bystial Lubellion + Beast (pop), Set Branded in Red </em></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, sending Albaz + Bystial Lubellion from deck.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Fusion summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon by fusing Albaz + Dark Monster with Albion.

Depending on the hand, your opponent may also be dealing with Mercourier's monster negate, Dramaturge's monster negate, Masquerade's -600 burn, and Granguinol can summon Proskenion from the Extra Deck. Red-Eyes Dragoon can also be summoned, a much needed omni-negate that Branded needs. If you're lucky, you also have a facedown Super Polymerization - a devasting turn ending card if used at the right time. Your hand will likely also be sizeable and ready with follow-up for next turn since Cartesia, Alba-Lenatus and Albion generate resources during the end phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going second, Branded can slog through interruption, pierce through boards and beat down your opponent's monsters with big beatsticks. Branded is naturally equipped with in-engine ways to play going second. Polymerization fusing into Guardian Chimera is a nigh-unstoppable juggernaut since it's effect is often chainblocked with the fusion material used for it's fusion summon and it is untargetable since you used Polymerization. If Branded Opening is on the field, it also can't be destroyed! Super Polymerization can fuse away most boards in today's meta, especially with Garura, only needing 2 monsters with the same type and attribute. Muddy Mudragon can fuse away your Kashtira opponent's Diablosis + Ariseheart as well! Against the rare Dragon deck, Albaz can contact fuse their problematic Dragons away like Borrload Savage Dragon and Crystal Wing into Alba-Lenatus. Alot of interruption these days involve flipping monsters facedown, destroying and banishing (For example, Traptrix, Labrynth, Ninja and Kashtira does this alot) - Branded is very comfortable with that since they can fuse face down monsters and shuffle back banished monsters with Lubellion to fusion summon.</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Branded lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Backrow floodgates absolutely slaughter Branded, so if you're against an opponent using something like Rivalry of Warlords, it probably is time to proceed to next game! Be sure to side in backrow hate in those match-ups!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;Guardian Chimera is the best card to crack open established boards. With it's untargetability, beefy 3300ATK/DEF statline and non-targeting destruction, most boards fall to this offensive juggernaut. If your opponent negates Polymerization/Branded in Red to prevent Chimera from coming out, they have wasted a precious interaction paving the way for you to use Branded Fusion.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">The best cards to side out is the Bystial package, especially when the match-up doesn't call for them (for ex. Traptrix/Kashtira don't have light/dark for Bystials to banish). Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">If Branded Lost is active, Fusion effect's activation cannot be negated. Cards that negate the activation like Baronne De Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon and even Solemn Judgment cannot negate your Branded Fusion! Branded Lost is a perfect way to bait a negate or to guarantee your Fusion effect when you're against these threats. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">In certain common meta match-ups, Dragoon is untouchable by your opponent. If you can, try to summon Dragoon before you use key cards like Branded Fusion to guarantee it's resolution. Also, if you want to play around Nibiru, summon Dragoon before 5 summons. Dragoon is also your go-to answer when facing down Kashtira Ariseheart's macro-cosmos like floodgate and targeting banish.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></li></ul></div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof"">The culmination of the ""Abyss"" storyline also coincides with the strongest form that Branded has ever fielded. All the support for Branded over the last couple years creates a consistent, strong and resilient deck. Naturally playing through established boards while having a robust grind game is only something that few decks can boast. To see for youself how this deck performs vs. meta, I highly recommend you see the deck in action by watching the Youtube video linked below!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Our hero, Albaz has faced his enemies to ultimately triumph through trials and adversity.

This can search with Triamid Cruiser when you otherwise cannot get it into the graveyard. You can then go into a Level 7 Synchro with the Token summoned by Flora.<br /><br />Ideally, your Level 5 Synchro will be Naturia Beast, if you hard drew into your Field Spells and do not need to use Garden Rose Flora.<br /><br />Triamid Pulse is an extremely valuable trap.

At this point you can search Tally-Ho! with Champion Sargas and Regulus with Qliphort Genius afterwards.<br />- Try to always summon Kitt and then use Branded in High Spirits to send Sprind to the GY, end with any kind of Xyz with material on the field so that in the end phase Sargas can be special summoned from your deck, giving you a face-up removal + Champion Sargas additional removal immediately after.<br />- If you didn't use your Normal summon until the end, you can make sure Sargas is in the graveyard and Brothers in hand, and instead use two monsters to make IP Masquerena. Then on your opponent's turn you can summon Unicorn, discard Brothers to remove a card, then summon Sargas to have his removal on the field too.<br />- On the other hand, if you didn't use your Normal summon, you can add Cartesia to your hand with High Spirits, normal summon her, then use either a spare Kitt on the field or whatever Extra Deck monster is of no use to you anymore to summon either Rindbrumm or Mirrorjade. Rindbrumm allows for an additional negate and Albaz extender. If it leaves the field you can either bring it or Albaz right back, Albaz could use its effect to fuse with an opponent's monster and make either Lubellion or Mirrorjade.<br />- If you summoned Merrymaker without the field you can revive it with Tally-Ho! Then you can search Interluder with Branga to have a continuous omni-negate.<br />- Ash/DRNM/Called By can be replaced with any staples you want. If you want to make even more space for them you can also take out Pedor and 1 Branga. I'd say 1 Sargas but you REALLY want 1 in the Deck always, and it sucks if he's your dedicated discard target, plus you always want more Springans names available. If you want even more space you can take out Albaz and Cartesia (and if you do then also Lubellion, Mirrorjade and Rindbrumm).</p><p>You can very effortlessly end with a board of 2 or 3 removals and 1 or 2 omni-negates, plus a little bit extra disruption from either Number 38, Redoer or Dweller or whatever generic Rank 4 or 8 you prefer like Bagooska, Dingirsu, or even bring a UDF pack instead of Draglubion.&nbsp;<br />It's fun, easy to play and versatile enough to fit different strategies.

You can Normal Summon this card to directly set&nbsp;<strong>Dinomorphia Frenzy&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Dinomorphia Intact</strong> (whichever you are missing or need) and we are playing 3 copies just to have material to fusion with Frenzy. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dreaming Nemurelia</strong>. It is better to draw her than to place her directly into your Extra Deck. She places herself in the Extra Deck and places a Nemurelia Continuous Spell directly from her Deck. On the crackback, she can summon herself from the ED and banish a card from your opponent's field or GY face-down for every 3 face-down of your banished cards and recycles some of them if you have no other cards in your ED besides her. Most of your Nemurelia cards do enough banishing and we are playing Pots for more banishing, but your techs for banishing is up to your really. 3 <strong>Nemurelia Realiser, the Dreamaterializer Sleeping Princess</strong>. This card Summons itself by placing one of your monsters on the bottom of the Deck and it either books a monster or places Nemurelia in your Extra Deck from your Deck. It is better to summon this off of the Trap for interruption, but it can set up Nemurelia which is definitely something. It will get a lot better once we get a card for Nemurelia that gets her from ED to hand. 2&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dreameater - Reveil</strong>. It's a free Summon by banishing 3 ED cards and you don't need Nemurelia. It can also send a Level 10 Beast from hand or field other than it to GY to set a Nemurelia Trap. The one we have right now is okay, but it might get better with more releases. 2&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Couette</strong>. This is a free Summon if you have a face-up Pendulum in your ED and it negates Targeting effects. 1&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Oreiller</strong>.

Then XYZ summon into Gigantic Spright (or link summon into Dharc or Hiita first then into GS if you're ready to sacrifice the card advantage to double its attack.) Use GS effect to special summon Ipiria to draw another card (or Capshell if you normal summoned Ipiria to start the combo). Link summon using I:P and that card into Spright Elf. Now the enginge gets interesting because, as long as your opponent controls a monster you can use Spright Elf to continuously special summon I:P from the graveyard and, during your opponents turn, use I:P to go into your higher level Links, such as Knightmare Unicorn to send a your opponent's monster right back to the deck as soon as they summon it during their Turn. Other options are I:P into borrelsword to close the game out or Appollousa if the gamestate will continue for a few more turns and you'll need some negate power. And with I:P's ability, each of these will have destruction protection. If youre not able to go into Link 3 or 4, Lib the World Key Blademaster is another good support option, if you've already used World Legacy Succession, who can then set another of those.</p><p>There are other options for additional support, such as Thunderdragon Colossus. Since Sprights are Thunder type, Thunder Dragonmatrix can be easily discarded to up the attack of one, then tribute it into Colossus, and still be able to pull of the majority of the rest of the Spright engine.</p><p>If you are able to get Duel Academy in the Field Spell Zone, this combo is all the more effective, as it can burn for 1000 damage once per turn when you use a spell card (when you have a Thunder monster on the field, which you almost always will). Even better, it can raise one of your monsters' attack by 1000 if a monster effect is activated while you have a fiend or Fairy (which you will if you have any of the Knightmare link monsters or Appollousa on the field or if you summon Capshell by Gigantic Spright's effect).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even without all this combo, it is very possible to OTK your opponent with the main deck Spright Cards, if your opponent did not get out a sufficient opening board, as you can flood the field with Levell 2s and use Spright Gamma Burst to raise their attack by 1400 each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Really fun deck, very high win rate.</p>"

I used this in duelist cup event and got 10 wins in a row against mostly Spright Runick Stun players. If your opponent uses Maxx C you have a very high chance of winning by deck out. The nemeses monsters can be special summoned from your hand if you have a banished monster. This allows you to search protos or eschatos. Using mills you find out what deck your opponent is playing then summon reproductus to make any attribute or monster type for lingering floodgate of eschatos or protos. Even worse if you summonend reproductus using IP Masquerena. This makes it indestructable by card effects including your eschatos/protos giving you infinite potential lingering floodgating. You can use chaos creator to shuffle back your necroface from banish zone. The chances of starting with a bricked hand is surprisingly low considering the lack of draw power. The major weakness to this deck is Artifact Scythe or similar special summon floodgates as well as Droll &amp; Lock Bird. One potential change I would consider is swapping in left arm offering to search grass or card destruction to increase FTK chances.</p>

It's a burden.  It demands sacrifice.,"<p>The full <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> archetype and a littany of Psychic monsters.&nbsp; I wanted to heavily emphasize combos and lifegain with this one, and play-tested a fair number of times to tune it to my liking.&nbsp; I'm personally running two custom cards I made <strong><em>(link below)</em></strong> in place of <strong>Overmind Archfiend</strong> and <strong>Supernatural Regeneration</strong>, keeping those two to the side in case someone wants to play with official cards only.&nbsp; Originally I was trying out a Dark/Wind/Psychic Teledad deck with <strong>Ezmerin</strong> as the Deck Master, but it didn't work out the way I wanted, as what I really wanted was as pure Psychic deck, and I really liked the structure that the <strong>P.U.N.K.s</strong> could offer.</p><p>The game-plan with this deck is to be tricky and use your life and monsters as resources to rush through combos.&nbsp; One of the main plays is getting out <strong>Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin</strong> as fast as possible to search for <strong>Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy</strong> Tune or another <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> to start accumulating card advantage.&nbsp; Once you've got a decent board of punks out you can start filling out the rest of the board with various support Psychics.&nbsp; Sometimes it's better to hold off on using various effects, like <strong>Ukiyoei-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon's</strong> on-summoned effect, so you can bring a monster back immediately for more power or combos.&nbsp; <strong>D.D. Seeker</strong> is really useful if you have <strong>Soul Absorption</strong> out, netting you 1000 LP a round (4 players), and he can protect anything you control from battle, targeting and destruction as a quick effect, as well as prevent them (or himself) from being banished by Emergency Teleport at the end of the turn.&nbsp; I opted not to run a <strong>Psy-Frame</strong> package in this deck as you really want to maintain a board presence, but I did put in the synchros, who can help with control, lifegain off of <strong>Soul Absorption</strong>, and returning your banished cards to the GY.&nbsp; <strong>Psychic End Punisher</strong> is one of my favorites.&nbsp; Whether you have more or less LP than an opponent, he gains attack equal to the difference.&nbsp; He alone can end games with his permanent ATK buff every turn, but it gets even worse if you chain <strong>Psychic Fervor</strong> to his battle phase effect activation - taking 3500 to double his ATK, and if you're already lower than your opponent, he'll gain even more.&nbsp; He and some of the monsters that gain life when they destroy monsters by battle work really well with <strong>Psychic Snail</strong>, who allows a Psychic monster to attack twice for 800 LP.&nbsp; <strong>Aromage Cananga</strong> helps by suppressing your opponent's stats and getting troublesome backrow cards out of the way. It's okay if some of your dudes get destroyed, as you can punish them with <strong>Psi-Curse</strong> and <strong>Telepathic Power</strong>, and you've got <strong><em>TONS</em></strong> of ways to recycle all of your cards.&nbsp; <strong>Ultimate Offering</strong> helps get out monsters quickly at a negligble cost to a lifegain deck, and <strong>Future Glow</strong> can make your board incredibly oppressive if you banish a level 7-11 Psychic monster from your GY.&nbsp; The <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> spells and traps are essential for locking in a win.&nbsp; The field spell let's you summon an extra <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> every turn, and you get up to 2 free draws per turn if you pay LP to activate a Psychic monster's effect.&nbsp; <strong>Gagaku-P.U.N.K. Wild Picking</strong> and <strong>Number 26: Spaceway Octobypass</strong> will have your opponent's thinking twice before attacking you.&nbsp; And you can hold up your <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> traps as a political threat, waiting until someone has the audacity to target you.&nbsp; I would suggest testing this deck on YGOPRO / Project Ignis for a while before playing so you can get a handle on all the possible combos and how to maximize the deck's potential.</p><p><strong>My two custom cards for this deck: https://imgur.com/a/gf3eSiB</strong></p><p>As for my custom <em><strong>Tao</strong></em> monster type, they're summoned by using monsters and spells/traps as material.&nbsp; You can always use set spells and traps for material by revealing them to your opponent, so long as they meets the summoning conditions. For <strong>Ezmerin the Psychokinetic</strong>, you use <strong>Ezmerin the Psycher</strong> (main deck monster) and 2 Psychic/'mentions ""Psychic"" in its text' spells/traps to summon her. you can use dead-weight cards like a lingering monster or <strong>Brain Hazard</strong> to summon her, and the main deck <strong>Ezmerin</strong> makes whatever Psychic Extra Deck monster you summon with her untargetable by your opponent's. To give a basic rundown of my Tao monsters, Tao (the yin-yang symbols) are treated as levels and ranks simultaneously, and any effect that would effect those without specifying Xyz monsters or specific monster card type will affect them as well.&nbsp; They don't double up the effect of something like ""monsters you control gain/lose 100 ATK/DEF times their Level/Rank""; it's just the single buff/nerf, like any other monster.&nbsp; And that's it.&nbsp; You now know how to play them.&nbsp; I don't use either of them as the Deck Master, as that would require a complete overhaul of the deck, since multiple <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> monsters don't fit into her Dark/Wind/Psychic domain, but she's fun to play either way.</p><p>Whichever way you decide to play this deck, I hope you all enjoy!&nbsp; <em>It's a blast!</em></p>"

Spright's many one card starters end on a board with multiple interruptions, negates and a decent grindgame.&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">Augmenting Live Twin with Sprights, this mischevious VTUBER duo are more powerful than ever before. As VTUBER and lightning flawlessly meld into each other and synergize, Live Twin's draw power/pop coupled with Spright's negates/grindgame create one of the strongest contenders in the Masterduel meta! (Fun fact, this deck was a finalist on a recent Masterduel tournament!)&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"">Harness the power of VTUBERs and LIGHTNING and electrify your Masterduel ladder opponents!</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

An emphasis on handtraps is particularly potent with Live Twins, since Ki-sikil draws you potentially 2-3 cards (once on your turn and another during your opponent's turn with Ki-sikil and Ki-sikil Frost). The handtrap line-up include the most common handtraps for Crossout Designator to negate.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">As we all know, 2 cards = Full Spright combo, and a normal summon of 1 Live Twin is enough to suffice for that. This makes each Live Twin a 1 card starter, and there are 10 cards in the deck that start your Live Twin combo (3 Lil-la, 2 Ki-sikil, 3 Secret Password, and 2 Sunny's Snitch).&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">8 Spright cards are also full combo (3 Blue, 3 Jet and 2 Starter), since they search pieces of the deck that summons more Sprights on board.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">With the Live Twins and Sprights conbined, this gives the deck a fantastic total of 18 one card starters! Each of these starters have the potential to end on a full board with 3+ interruptions, an ""Iblee lock"" and with several handtraps in hand!&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Spright Live Twin's gameplan is to interrupt and negate your opponent so much that they get out-resourced or they surrender since they've run out of options. Ki-sikil's draw 1, Lil-La's pop 1, Carrot's S/T negate, Red's monster negate, and Smasher's non-targeting banish are your main go-to choices of interruption. Most games you can Iblee lock your opponent so they cannot special summon except for link monsters, and if they try to link it away for a generic link 2 by normal summoning something, Lil-la will destroy their summoned monster to prevent the summon! I:P Masquerena is also an option, and she can be used to link summon during your opponent's main phase for Avramax or Underworld Goddess.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going first, you will establish a board with as many negations and interruptions as possible. Ideally in your hand, you should have several handtraps, especially those you drew off of Ki-sikil's effect.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going second, you will use your several handtraps to slow down or stop your opponent. If your opponent still has significant board presence you have the option to clear their board with Zeus. Summon 2 level 2s, XYZ summon Sky Cavalry Centaurea to eventually go to Zeus in main phase 2. From there, you can reset the board state, and play as normal next turn.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Here is this deck's mainline combo:&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Live Twin Lil-la + Spright Blue/Jet = Iblee Lock + I:P Masqurena, + Spright Elf revive (Blue/Jet/Carrot/Red) +&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted3"">Evil Twin Ki-sikil (draw 1) +&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted4"">Evil Twin Lil-la (Target/Destroy 1)</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Normal summon Lil-la.

Instead of summoning I:P Masqurena during the main combo, Artifact Dagda is summoned so it can set Scythe from deck. Lil-la pops Scythe during your opponent's main phase to start the lock!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">If you're going second and your opponent&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted6"">still has significant board presence, you can summon 2 level 2s, XYZ summon Sky Cavalry Centaurea to evetually go to Zeus in main phase 2. From there, you can reset the board state, and play as normal next turn.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span class=""ContentPasted6"">Since this deck relies a lot on hand traps, it is important to know the chokepoints of each deck, which handtraps are effective to use, what the most optimal time to handtrap your opponent's strategy, etc. For example, always save your Ash Blossom for your opponent's Branded Fusion!&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"">It generally is safer during the current meta to summon Spright Red during your first combo to negate a possible handtrap your opponent may use (especially Ghost Ogre vs. Gigantic Spright).&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">You can cut Iblee and Spright Gamma Burst to bring this deck down to 40 cards, as they aren't essential to this strategy.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Don't play the ""Maxx C challenge"" with this deck, unless you are confident you can OTK your opponent the same turn. Otherwise, if you go full combo, you'll be giving your opponent 10+ cards!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Unfortunately, Dark Ruler No More and most common floodgates eviscerate this deck. You can't handtrap/stop those cards!&nbsp;</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Also the ceiling for pure zombies is quite low with the amount of cards needed to reach a decent end board and the lack of follow up if the opponent clears the board.</p><p>The branded engine is perfect for consitensy as it gets necroworld banshee into the graveyard with branded fusion and has a banish on field with mirrorjade.</p><p>Combos:</p><p>You want to see zombie world/ necroworld banshee, uni-zombie/ shiranui solitaire/ doomking balderoch and 1 of the branded starters. You will normally open 2 out of 3 of these based on the play tests I have done.</p><p>If you open all 3 of these combo pieces you can make dragoon with balerdroch&nbsp;in the grave and zombie world on the field which is an omni, floodgate, banish and monster negate</p><p>If you don't see a line from the opening hand that can get balerdroch in the graveyard and zombie world on the field, you do not go into dragoon on that hand instead its mirrorjade with balderoch in the grave for 2 banishes and a negate for the next turn</p><p>Both these combo lines also play around nib</p><p>If you don't open a branded starter or have a way to go into one you do the normal zombie combo because you should have drawn at least 1 starter (the deck can still brick as it wouldn't be zombies if it couldn't) go to the normal zombie line where you end on baronne and balerdroch or red-eyes zombie dragon lord, balerdroch and felgrand in graveyard depending on what zombies you opened.</p><p>Handtraps/ Board breakers: I went with ash because it does work well in the zombie deck and is good against quite a few of the current meta decks, kaiju's were the other tech choice as with how kashtira are starting to play around lava golem and sphere mode kaiju's remove the arise heart without taking away your normal summon. The deck struggles to play through to many negates so being able to tribute an omni or monster negate helps the deck greatly.</p><p>Side Deck: The side deck is pretty standard evenly is very strong in this meta, twin twister being able to discard one helps the deck more than hinders it, rivalry zombie world will win the game on its own, ra's disciple branded expulsion also will win the game on it's own, called by is necessary hand traps hurt the deck greatly and if they side them in heavily it's good to have when your going first, by main decking kaiju's you get to side deck one of the strongest board clears avaliable in kaiju slumber as well and get a free level 8 body on the board for synchro plays</p>"

This Deck is very versatile, as almost any of the Zombie staples can be splashed in. This Deck can be brutally effective against many other Decks, as ""Zombie World"", as well as changing all your opponents monsters on the field and in the Graveyard into Zombies, also stops your opponent from Tribute Summoning anything other than a Zombie monster. This negatively affects many commonly used Decks, such as&nbsp;<a title=""Bujin"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Bujin"">Bujin</a>,&nbsp;<a title=""Plant"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Plant"">Plants</a>, and&nbsp;<a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Fire_Fist"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist</a>. Many cards are designed specifically to work with the Field Spell, such as ""<a title=""Doomkaiser Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Doomkaiser_Dragon"">Doomkaiser Dragon</a>"" or ""<a title=""Trap of the Imperial Tomb"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trap_of_the_Imperial_Tomb"">Trap of the Imperial Tomb</a>"" or even ""<a title=""Sacred Crane"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Crane"">Sacred Crane</a>"" or ""<a title=""Molten Zombie"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Zombie"">Molten Zombie</a>"" for draw power. Other cards have indirect merit, such as ""<a title=""Getsu Fuhma"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Getsu_Fuhma"">Getsu Fuhma</a>"", ""<a title=""Marionette Mite"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Marionette_Mite"">Marionette Mite</a>"", or even ""<a title=""Tutan Mask"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Tutan_Mask"">Tutan Mask</a>"" when used on your opponents to stop pesky Spells or Traps. Another good card to try is ""<a title=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Beelze_of_the_Diabolic_Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"", using ""<a title=""Plaguespreader Zombie"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguespreader_Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>"" you can go into any level 6 Synchro monster, then bring Plaguespreader back using its effect, then Synchro Summon again for ""Beelze"".</p><p>This Deck has many Zombie staples such as ""Pyramid Turtle"", ""Zombie Master"", ""Goblin Zombie"", or ""Plaguespreader Zombie"" if you want to&nbsp;<a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro Summon</a>. The key player in this Deck is without a doubt ""Il Blud"". ""<a title=""Kasha"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kasha"">Kasha</a>"" can also be included, but remember that monsters treated as Zombies by the effect of ""Zombie World"" that are returned to the Deck are not counted towards its ATK. ""<a title=""Immortal Ruler"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal_Ruler"">Immortal Ruler</a>"" can also be used to recycle ""Zombie World"". Another excellent card to use is ""<a title=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Zombie_Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a>"", which allows you to Summon any Zombie which it destroys by battle. ""<a title=""Pyramid Turtle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Pyramid_Turtle"">Pyramid Turtle</a>"" and ""<a title=""The Black Stone of Legend"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Stone_of_Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a>"" can be used to search ""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""<a title=""Night Dragolich"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Dragolich"">Night Dragolich</a>"", while not a Zombie monster, can be used to support the Deck since the majority of its monsters will be Special Summoned from the Graveyard, if the likes of ""Doomkaiser Dragon"" are not being used (unless they are revived after being destroyed), which may not be the case for the opponent. ""<a title=""Curse of Dragonfire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_Dragonfire"">Curse of Dragonfire</a>"" can also be used with this Deck to not only destroy opposing Field Spells, but also Fusion Summon ""<a title=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonecro_Nethersoul_Dragon"">Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a>"" while ""Zombie World"" is on the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

All you need is either Rainbow Bridge, Crystal Bond, or Sapphire Pegasus.</p><p>1: Use <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=63945693"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/63945693.jpg"" data-card=""63945693"" data-name=""Rainbow Bridge"">Rainbow Bridge</span></a> to search for <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=9334391"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/9334391.jpg"" data-card=""9334391"" data-name=""Crystal Bond"">Crystal Bond</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p>2: Use Crystal Bond to add <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=7093411"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/7093411.jpg"" data-card=""7093411"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus"">Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus</span></a> to your hand, and to place <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=21698716"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/21698716.jpg"" data-card=""21698716"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle"">Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle</span></a> into your Spell/Trap Zone</p><p>3: Normal summon Sapphire Pegasus, and activate its effect to place <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=36795102"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/36795102.jpg"" data-card=""36795102"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon"">Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon</span></a> into your Spell/Trap Zone</p><p>4: Activate Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon's effect, banishing it to special summon another Sapphire Pegasus from your deck while adding <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=79856792"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79856792.jpg"" data-card=""79856792"" data-name=""Rainbow Dragon"">Rainbow Dragon</span></a> to your hand</p><p>5: Overlay the two copies of Sapphire Pegasus in your monster zones to special summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=32530043"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/32530043.jpg"" data-card=""32530043"" data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</span></a> to an extra monster zone (placing it here gives you more room to summon cards with your tuner monsters.

I think you have to play more than one copy of this card, as it's a powerful interruption + a good protection for your field monsters (it also includes not Marincess monsters).

IMO, Pot can be annoying if you banish the field spell. But most of the time, you are supposed to use it after having searched your Battle Ocean.

It's for me a good way to start to play after some interruptions (Marincess is pretty weak to the handtraps in general), especially with Ash and Nibiru in the meta.</li><li>The use of some Marincess monsters is debatable.

If sniped by Danger! effect, Branded Fusion cannot be played. If going second, Fallen of Albaz can be normal summoned, attempting to use opponent's monsters as material for Lubellion (if dark attribute) or directly into Mirrorjade (if they have extra deck monsters on the board). Fallen of Albaz is usually best sent from the deck.</p><p>- Drawing more than 1 Branded Fusion bricks your hand significantly. Can remove copies as needed, but then limits the Branded combo likelihood</p><p>- Called By The Grave, opponent Ash Blossom, and Ghost Belle completely shut down Dark World grave effects and Branded Fusion.</p><p>- Deck is significantly lacking in draw power. If you utilize Danger!s, Dark Worlds, and Braded Fusion all in one turn, you can often be left without a hand. Maintaining at least 1 card in hand is absolutely essential for the Grapha fusion effect, but more cards in hand is always better for further discard power.

The branded side board is an idea I've been working on with regular Cyber Dragon Decks and if your opponent has a way like Necrovalley to keep you from your GY Dragunitys, they're able to be fully subbed out into a Cyber Branded list which can run fairly well in my experience.

MAX in March 2023's Duelist Cup.</p><p>Let's start by talking about ""missing the timing of activation."" Swap Frog's effect text has these two words ""when and ""can"" which is an indicator that this effect in order to activate, no event should take place after the effect's condition ""When this card is Summoned."" In my case, I activated Ronintoadin's effect (chain 1), then I chained Spright Elf to summon Swap Frog from the GY. Chains in Yu-Gi-Oh! resolve backwards, so Spright Elf summons Swap Frog (the effect must activate at this very moment and cannot wait), chain 2 resolved and we move to chain 1 summoning Ronintoadin. Chain's cannot be interrupted after they start resolving and must resolve fully before any card can be activated, so Swap Frog when it was summoned wanted to activate, but according to the rules that's illegal and since this kind of effect does not wait, it ends up missing the timing of activation.</p><p>Things to note about this deck:<br />- Spright Starter and Gigantic Spright lock you from Special Summoning above Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. In the case of Gigantic Spright, it locks both you and your oponent from Special Summoning above Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. The text also says ""For the rest of this turn"" which means you can still summon any Level/Rank/Link prior to the activation of the effect of any of these two cards.<br />- Avramax inherently cannot be targeted by any effect and your oponent can only attack him. With I:P Masquerena, Avramax gains protection from destruction. Avramax's effect to gain attack power during Damage Calculation can only work against Special Summoned monsters.<br />- If you don't have the materials to summon Number 65: Djinn Buster and you're summoning using Spright Elf while Swap Frog is in the GY, make sure to summon it to send another copy of itself to the GY for Ronintoadin. Having that extra Special Summon will always matter.</p><p>As usual, you can find the gameplay video below. Enjoy the replays! Peace.</p>"

But that doesn't mean Floo is unusable without their primary floodgate; it just means we'll have to adapt and rely on new weapons, including a new bird to the fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p>Simorgh's Winged-Beast and Wind typing make it an easy fit to the Floo system, with Elborz providing strong search potential when Magnificent Map doesn't get drawn, and Simorgh itself acting as good fodder for tribute summons.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrier's ban means that to remain viable (and as annoying as usual), we'll have to put greater emphasis on two familiar cards; Empen and Unexplored Winds. Empen's surprisingly oppressive and effective floodgating along with Unexplored Winds' strong, Super Poly-style disruption creates a strong core to build around.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than that, load your deck up with other knick-knacks like the (honestly, quite OP) Harpie's Feather Storm, which synergizes really well with Simorgh; Nibiru for Sprights and other combo decks; along with the interesting choice of Lancea, to be used against Kashtira, the spiritual successor to Tearlaments. They'll need a lot of banishing to get their work done, so a well places Lancea will send them reeling. Other than that, side deck options include Ultimate Slayer, Forbidden Lance, Cyclone, etc. AND ALSO D. Shifter, which has moved from main deck tyrant, to rogue side deck option. Banishing extra cards just makes things easier for Kashtiras, with Arise-Heart's Macro Cosmos-esque effect.&nbsp;</p><p>As a finishing note, you might be interested in the very out-of-place extra deck; it's used as a facade, a way to confuse opponents, particularly Kashtira fans and their frequent Diablosis uses, which can get them completely mistaken about your archetypes (pretty common Tearlaments-ish extra deck). You barely use the extra deck anyways, with Floo's inherent restrictions on extra deck summoning, so make use of it in a different way! You can optionally add a synchro monster for Ultimate Slayer, but I didn't because it might mess with the illusion.&nbsp;</p>"

And in case Baronne used it effect to negate Nibiru, you can always setup a Watapon via Benten being tributed for Doombroker. During your opp standby, activate Baronne effect to ss Diviner, send Trias and you can pop a card using Trias effect tributing Diviner + Watapon, so always 2 interruption-guaranteed.

Maybe both? The idea is to lock your opponent out of game by playing Rexterm or Plasma. At first, this doesn't seem like it works, but this deck is fun. So you have three lock out options, two you can use at the same time.</p><p>First one is Destiny Hero Dark Angel. You Fusion Destiny into Destiny Hero Dominence and place in defense mode. Three destiny heroes in GY are needed to activate Dark Angel and palce on opponents side of the field. Your three targets are Dreadmaster, Draw Hand, and Disk Commander. What you do is activate Dominence effect to look at the top five cards and stack them how you want. When Dominence is destroyed at the end phase of the next turn, Special Summon Dreadmaster, Disc Commander, and Draw Hand. Disc Commander and Draw Hand lets you draw 3 cards off their effect.</p><p>Second is Rexterm, Draw Therizia and search Frenzy. Set the card in your S/T zone, and fusion summon on your opponents turn. First into Kentrigina and then Rexterm. Rexterm prevents your opponent from activating monster effects if they are equal or more to your life points. Rexterm's quick effect is to half the life points and make opponents monsters equal your life points.</p><p>The Third is Plasma Plus D-Force, You get three monsters on the field, play D-Force to search Plasma and then play Plasma. Plasma is both Skill Drain and Relinquished at the same time. Easy way to get the three monsters on the field is play Fusion Destiny and summon any destiny hero monster from the extra deck but make sure your targets are Malicious and Denier. They can summon themselves from the GY. They're an easy summon, and can turbo out Plasma easy. Plasma + Rexterm just says nope to all effects and D-Force gives Plasma staying power. They're pretty formidable together and they annoy friends pretty easy too.</p><p>I wanted to post something different and see where this goes. If you build the deck, I promise you'll have fun with it. Happy Dueling.</p>"

Earn that Diamond 1 or MAX Duelist LVL!!!,"<div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">Spright Runick is arguably the current reigning champion of Masterduel meta as of March 2023. The ridiculously strong combination of Spright and Runick's smothering control and endless grind game create a deck that all strategies would have to fear and respect. Sprights ending on 3-5 interruptions (Red's monster negate, Carrot's S/T negate, Smasher's banish, and I:P Masquerena's quick link) combined with Runick's draw 3 and quick play spells generally stop any deck cold in their tracks. Both archetypes combined have a potential 10+ interruptions for your opponent to slog through, while maintaining a superior resource loop - outpacing most other strategies!</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">If you want to win and reach Diamond 1 or reach max rank in Duelist Cup in Masterduel with a relentlessly strong control strategy, you've chosen to pilot the correct deck!</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</span><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><strong>SPRIGHT&nbsp;</strong>has 8 one card starters in the deck (3 Blue, 3 Jet and 2 Starter). In any case, if you don't open any of these cards, 2 level 2 monsters would create Gigantic Spright, leading to full Spright combo. Spright has immense synergy with Runick since their quick play spells summoning Hugin already fulfills one of the two level 2s needed for Gigantic Spright or Spright Elf!&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">There are 16 <strong>RUNICK&nbsp;</strong>quick play spells in the deck to maximize the chances of drawing 2-3 in your opening hand in a deck of 40 cards. Ideally, the duelist would use 1 quick play spell to summon Hugin, searching for Runick Fountain, 1 for the discard for Hugin's cost to search, and the last quick play spell to trigger Fountain, drawing you 2-3 cards. After Hugin is established on board, it is a level 2 - enabling your Spright combo.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">The rest of the deck is composed of <strong>STAPLES</strong>, designed to counter the current meta of Masterduel. 2 of each staple rather than 3 is used to lower the likelihood of drawing multiples of the same card. 2 Cosmic Cyclone is generally useful, and more so important in the common Runick mirror match to banish Fountain. 2 Lava Golem is used to tribute through established boards, especially when versing other Spright players. Lava Golem is great in this deck since it doesn't require it's normal summon. 2 Maxx ""C"" and 2 Ash Blossom are always really good in OCG-centred Masterduel format. Drawing more cards with Maxx ""C"" is great for keeping other decks in check while providing you with more Runick ammunition to play with.</div><div><br class=""ContentPasted2"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Spright Runick's gameplan is to interrupt and negate your opponent so much that you out resource them. If they don't outright surrender, the strategy is to deck them out in an extended grind game as Spright Elf recovers/recycles Sprights in the GY and Runick Fountain draws you up to 3 cards every turn. Theoretically, your opponent will be so helpless and out-resourced that they cannot come close to attacking you for game, especially as you and your monsters hide behind your Avramax.</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Here is the mainline combo for this Spright Runick:</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Spright 1 card starter + Runick quick play spell(s) = Spright Elf, I:P Masquerena, 3-5 cards and possibly Spright Red/Carrot with a set Smashers.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><ol><li>Activate Runick quick play spell to summon Hugin.&nbsp;</li><li>Hugin searches for Runick Fountain. Discard a card for cost (Ideally you discard another Runick quick play to draw more with Runick Fountain You can also discard another Spright since it can be revived later by Elf).&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Runick Fountain. If you can trigger Runick Fountain with another quick play spell, activate it to draw 1-3 cards. It is best to do this after you finish all your searching with your Spright combo to increase your chances of drawing into more Runick quick-play spells or handtraps.</li><li>Activate your 1 card Spright starter. Do the full Spright combo! (Spright Blue -&gt; Spright Jet -&gt; Searches Starter or Smashers).&nbsp;</li><li>Use Hugin + Blue/Jet to XYZ summon Gigantic.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Gigantic's effect to summon your level 2 (Capshell/Iperia draw 1, Red/Carrot negate) of choice from deck by detaching the Spright material.&nbsp;</li><li>Link away Blue/Jet and level 2 summoned from deck to link summon Spright Elf.&nbsp;</li><li>Elf summons level 2 of choice from GY.&nbsp;</li><li>Link away Level 2 from GY + Gigantic Spright = I:P Masquerena.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have any other extenders, summon them, and set any cards you want to use in the backrow like Smashers.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>This combo should leave you with Spright Elf's quick summon from GY, I:P Masquerena's quick link, and perhaps a negate with Spright Red/Carrot. You may have drawn 3-5 cards due to Runick Fountain, Ipiria and Capshell, leaving you with many of interruptions ready in your hand. You also may have a set Smashers or Cosmic Cyclone.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>During your opponent's turn, you may have 3-10 interruptions ready for them (highly dependent on opening hand and draws). Your life points and low ATK monsters are protected as you link away Elf + Masquerena for Avramax (You can also link into Unicorn for the targeted shuffle or Underworld Goddess for blanket negate and GY summon negate). On top of that, you will continue to draw additional cards with Runick Fountain on your opponent's turn!&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Due to your immense pressure as you choke your opponent out of their possible plays and banish their deck, they will surrender in no time as they are out-resourced and out-matched!&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3""> GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><div><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you want to play safe to protect your combos, summon Spright Red early so it can negate the ever-prevalent Ash Blossom and Nibiru.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Verses S/T strategies, summon Spright Carrot to protect your plays. This is useful in Runick matchups and the occasional Labrynth player.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Little known fact, you can still successfully use I:P Masquerena in this strategy if your opponent drops Dark Ruler No More! CL1 your opponent uses Dark Ruler, CL2 you use one of your quick play spells, then CL3 I:P Masquerena activates her quick link effect! Ideally she links away your monsters (who would otherwise be negated) for Underworld Goddess, who is unaffected by Dark Ruler No More.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Avramax is the ideal I:P Masquerena link target, linking with Elf. After your opponent's first action in main phase (CL1), chain Masquerena's effect (CL2), then Elf's effect to summon from GY (CL3). Avramax is a monster many decks have difficulty outing since he is untargetable, indestructible (due to Masquerena) and mostly unkillable in battle! Your lifepoints and low ATK monsters are in good hands with him around!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If your opponent resolves Maxx ""C,"" don't continue with the Spright combo. It just isn't worth it giving your opponent 10+ cards. Your Runick cards are still a potent force!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Keep in mind that with Spright Runick, your Extra Monster Zone is used up by Spright Elf - meaning you can't protect your cards from destruction effects by summoning Hugin.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Dharc the Dark Charmer is full Spright combo. Dharc summons dark monster from opponent's GY -&gt; Link away into Spright Elf -&gt; Elf summon level 2 from GY -&gt; Elf + level 2 makes Gigantic Spright -&gt; Proceed to Spright combo!</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div></div><div><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div>I would say that Spright Runick is the ultimate meta deck as of March 2023 (If you pilot this deck, you are officially a hardcore, no-fun, meta sheep.

It does literally everything!&nbsp;</p><p>The key to this deck is getting to TDMs and/or your Fusion material monsters including and mainly DM (and his Fusions majority wise, using Dragons).

A rare props to Konami for their design choices for the support for this archetype. Granting an underpowered deck with one of the strongest forms of removal, Laevatein's ""XYZ superpoly"" fixes Generaider's problems breaking boards going second. Generaider's crippling limitations with level 9 bricks in hand is largely solved by Vala while simultaneously enabling rank 9 plays is genius!&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all, this older deck is granted new life for today's meta with two very strong support cards. Now, give your opponent the Boss Rush of their dueling career as you negate, hand-rip and XYZ super poly to victory with Generaiders!!!</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted6 ContentPasted9"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted6 ContentPasted9"">&nbsp;GLHF Duelists!<br class=""ContentPasted8"" /></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

When Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon was banned, the deck took a heavy hit, since Chaos Ruler helped majorly with consistency and play extension. However, the deck is not totally dead, as the new Chaos Synchro cards heavily increase the consistency of the Main Deck, allowing for far easier spamming of Level 8 Synchros, as well as the bigger boys, like Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, Bane, and of course, Red Supernova Dragon, as well as some new DARK Synchro Monsters, like Bystial Dis Pater, and some non-Dragons in case you're able to Summon them, like Chaos Angel and Chaos Beast.</p><p>The deck's win conditions are still mostly the same. Hope for a good hand, or use the many consistency tools to sculpt one, then go down the Crimson Resonator line into Red Supernova Dragon. This time, however, the Chaos Synchro cards help save your Normal Summon throughout the combo, making it just a little easier to play through interruption, and allowing you to continue your combo after the Supernova hits the field. A new major boss of the deck, Bystial Dis Pater, helps with interruptions. Being a DARK Dragon Synchro Monster, it combos perfectly with the two Traps, Red Reign and Time to Stand Up, allowing for it and either Trap to hold the field down until the next turn. Specifically, with Red Reign, you can banish all monsters your opponent controls in the middle of their combo (as long as you do so before they get a Level 10 or higher monster), then if they can continue further, Dis Pater can shuffle one of your opponent's banished monsters (or one of your own) into the Deck, then either negate the effect of or destroy the monster they were hoping to save their field with. Time to Stand Up is also a monster negate from the Graveyard while you control Dis Pater (or any other Level 10 or higher DARK Dragon Synchro Monster), and it's easy to set up, as it can banish itself the same turn you use its field effect to Special Summon some Resonators from your Deck, which you can hopefully use to your advantage next turn. If you wish to Special Summon Red Resonator and use its Special Summon effect to heal yourself for a phat 3500+ LP, activate it in Chain Link 1, please.</p><p>Other changes from my previous Red Dragon Archfiend deck include a smaller Rokket package; really just a trimming of the excess Rokkets, as you don't really need two Recharger or Synchron. A third copy of Tracer was shaved as well, as though it's a good Normal Summon, you'd prefer to Special Summon it with Quick Launch. Space can be made for a third copy, though. Some Extra Deck fluff was shaved. Ancient Pixie Dragon is no longer necessary, as making Level 6s and Level 8s are much easier than Level 7s with the new Chaos Synchro cards. Chaos Ruler was also removed, since it is now unfortunately banned. A second copy of Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend was included, as its name is useful, and its effect is serviceable, especially in the relatively low-ATK meta we're seeing right now. Some other cards that could be included in the Main Deck are seen in the Side. I couldn't find space (or necessity) for Chaos Mirage Dragon, Resonator Command, or Burning Soul, but they may be preferrable to some. Chaos Angel and Chaos Beast were only included because the Extra Deck isn't super tight, and they may be useful in the niche situation where you're bloated with Chaos monsters who don't lock you into Dragons. Chaos Angel's LIGHT material effect is extremely useful if you can bring it out, as activated monster effect immunity can be incredibly useful for securing the effects of your Red Dragon Archfiends. Chaos Beast is also nice as a self-recurring Synchro Material, finding itself useful for niche comebacks where you can manage to use it for Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend or even Red Supernova Dragon. Void Ogre Dragon is more useable in this version of the deck, as you can empty your hand fairly quickly with the banishing to achieve a deadily field. Hopefully Void Ogre Dragon is enough Spell/Trap negation to balance out the loads of monster negation and overall shafting that the other Synchros and Trap Cards provide. Red Resonator is also more useful than in some other versions, as the Chaos Synchro monsters in the Main Deck can be Special Summoned by any card effect, not just their own, making some awkward hands where you have no banish material playable, where even Crimson Resonator might be useless in that situation.</p><p>I hope this decklist is to your likings, Kings. This should hold us over nicely until Konami reveals the new Red Dragon Archfiend support cards we should be getting soon-ish from the semi-recently revealed Jack Atlas Structure Deck. We will all soon be the Masters of Faster, and we shall all soon rule the duels, Kings.</p>"

If it isn't low enough, use Kentregina to get it even lower!<br /><br />Diplos summons can provide support if Kentregina's already out, throwing Sonic or Brute into the grave to use from Kentregina.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you draw either Solemn card, have them set before you use Therizia or Lilith, or save them for your opponent's turn to lock-down the board.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ferret Flames compliments your low LP and can help clear away your opponent's monsters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gozen, Rivalry, and Mistake is nasty to use all at once, with Imperial Custom to support them, but limiting your spell / trap zone, rarely seen, but used with caution.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mistake counters your Fossil Digs, so make sure if you get one, use it before activating Mistake.&nbsp;</p>"

This could be due to Chaos Ruler being legal plus Tear still being the best deck in the OCG but the TCG variant of the deck (when Assault Synchron gets released) has it's own merits too.</p><p>We have 2 extra copies of Bystial Magnamhut, an extremely strong crackback tool for your turn 3. We also have an extra copy of E-tele which gives the consistency of the P.U.N.K package a bit more of a boost. Lastly, we have slightly different chain block rules. in the OCG, you can't chain block using cards in your hand while in the TCG you can. This means every single bystial on turn 2/3 is a chain block and E-tele is a chain block.</p><p>While the loss of Chaos Ruler is quite a hit to this deck's consistency and ceiling, losing the extra level 8 for rank 8 plays and the search + mill is devestating, Jam Drive Dragon is still really useful and strong.</p><p>If you want to remove the extra tools of finding Assault Synchron then you can use the P.U.N.K field spell for some extra draws. If you were to get rid of anything for the P.U.N.K field spell, I'd recommend removing On Your Marks, Get Set, DUEL! as it's a continuous spell meaning MST can negate it.</p><p>I think this deck is going to still be really strong, despite the different meta climate we're in and how we dont have Chaos Ruler. I wouldn't be surprised if this deck is at the very least tier 2 when Assault Synchron releases.</p>"

I had a busy work schedule these past few weeks and took over a lot of my editing time. However I am proud of this variant of Labryth, A mashup that uses the cards from the new structure deck: ""Beware of the Traptrix"". To put it simply, use ""Trap-Hole"" cards to do Traptrix things and proceed with the Labrynth juxtapose. How do Labryth's play a role here? While it isn't too big, Lady Labrynth of the Silver Castle can set normal trap cards from the deck if you activate any normal trap card during either players turn. Then we go from there on out.</p>"

The others are cards you can side in to play more of a standard Tri-Brigade Deck by siding out the Bears and the Gorillas and the Liang Peaks.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Full combo is access to the Fraktall line as well as Rank 4 access with access to Fire Fist Bear. If you have Dragon and another Fire Fist, you can discard the extra Fire Fist for Kerass and get out Eagle and use Dragon to Summon back the Fire Fist you discarded. If you have Elephant, you can discard some other Beast, Beast Warrior, or Winged Beast for Kerass, make Eagle, and Normal Elephant to get out another Fire Fist from hand. Then, if you have any Fire Formation on field, you can use Eagle to return it to hand to dump Buffalo from Deck for a Level 4 body. Either way, you want Eagle on field along with 3 Fire Fist monsters, one of them being Bear and the others being any Level 4. The two Level 4's make Tiger King who sets Liang Peak. You then use Bear to pop Tiger King to get a Gorilla and a Bear from Deck. Your spent Bear and Gorilla make another Tiger King who sets Sinto. Bear destroys it again and you summon another Gorilla and Bear. Make another Tiger King who sets Domei, Tensu, or Tenki (whichever you don't have). Bear destroys it and it Summons 2 Dragons from Deck. Link off some stuff for something like Ferrijit or Apollousa in order to clear the field. The first Dragon summons back Tiger King and the other Summons back Bear. The two Dragons make a Rank 4 like Dweller or Giant Hand to clear the field again. Then, you can use Bear to pop Tiger King again for 2 Fraktall. At this point, you can Xyz or Link Summon another monster to clear the board. Fraktall banish 2 to summon Double Dragon Lords. From there, you can continue Linking off to clear the board. Here, you can continue extending with Tensu or Buffalo (if it is still in GY), or if you have 10 counters on Liang Peak, you can Summon Tamer Editor who Summons Domitianus or Heraklinos. If you have Tri-Brigade Roar during this whole thing, you can set it as a monster negate or use it to send Bearbrumm to grab Revolt.</span></p>"

You can also get the monster negate of Mechaba by linking Aleister into Artemis and then using Invocation or, if you manage to, summon Dragoon and then at the end of your main phase summon Invoked Caliga, this way you'll negate the only effect your opponent can activate that turn. Also, Dragoon doesn't get destroyed after Eternal Soul leaves the field so don't worry about it. There's a big set of hand traps so you can stop your opponent in time. Or, if you happen to have Piercing the Darkness in hand, summon Dark Magician the dragon knight and search for Eternal Soul, it's unbeatable, literally. That's all, I think.</p>"

Transfurlmine can also set Magikey Unlocking, which is a Spell/Trap negate and it also can set up Transfurlmine in some scenarios which you haven't already used his effect to destroy on summon<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Theory</strong></p><p>The main theory is that you can use Advanced Ritual Art or Magikey Maftea (given you have a normal monster on field) to send Baby Dragon and Flamvell Guard to the graveyard to ritual summon Batosbuster. Batosbuster will add Magikey World, searching Mafteal. You can reveal Mafteal, get an extra normal summon, and then Summon both him and Special Summoning the Baby Dragon from Graveyard. Mafteal has a restriction which makes him only able to be used as material for a ""Magikey"" monster, but batosbuster does NOT have this restriction, meaning you can use both it and Baby Dragon to make Ancient Fairy Dragon, allowing you to pop world and add Union Hangar to do the main ABC combo. We're only running 1 of each of the ABC pieces, which can be garnets, but luckily Magikey World allows you to search Maftea and put a piece back into the deck to smooth out some bad hands.<br /><br /><strong>Breakdown</strong></p><p>We're running 2 of the Baby Dragons and Flamevell Guards, this is because you usually dont want to draw one so you can send them off of ARA, but it's also ok to draw them so that you can normal summon them and use Maftea to send the other from deck for batosbuster. This deck doesn't need it's normal summon, so we're also running Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands to add a missing combo piece to our hand while also getting extra material on field. A really neat interaction is using ABC-Dragon Buster's effect to summon the 3 pieces from the graveyard. Assuming you have a discard in hand, you can use AFD to pop Union Hangar and add Magikey World, using it to search Garesglasser and Maftea while putting that discard fodder back into your deck. You can then use Maftea to summon Garesglasser with the 2 ABC pieces, because either way you can just banish the ones from the graveyard to get to ABC-Dragon Buster again. In theory, we can also make Tellarknight Ptolemaeus which can detach 3 materials to rank up into Cyber Dragon Nova, then into Infinity for an omni-negate/removal, and banish all 3 pieces from the grave to make ABC-Dragon buster.</p><p><strong>Side Deck Explanation</strong></p><p>We're hilariously able to side deck Twin Long Rods #2 and Jerry Beans Man. Because Baby Dragon can be a flex slot for any Level 3 Normal Monster, we can side it out for these cards to make Transfurlmine more effective against Water/Earth decks. We're of course siding 3 Nibiru and Eclipse against Kashtira. The 3 Cosmic Cyclone is just because Anti-Spell Fragrance is running around, and that turns off our entire strategy, so we need an answer to that (and other floodgates if nessecary). Since this deck doesn't need it's normal summon, we can also side Jinzo just because Labrynth is also really popular this format.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this deck! It's a lot of fun.</p>"

I have been doing extensive testing on this deck in order to make this deck as strong as possible.&nbsp; This deck can put up 4 monster negates on a 12,500 attack towers with a potential multi attack, two omni negates, 7 quick effect bounces, one hand rip, one quick effect monster destroy, and one quick effect spell/trap card destroy all in one turn.&nbsp; And not just with one turn but with one card.&nbsp; Combine this with the board breakers I have in the deck and you get a powerhouse of a deck.&nbsp; Go second and you will break apart most boards unless they come prepared with multiple spell or trap negates including one that comes from something other than a monster.&nbsp; After your opponent's board is broken you can freely go into the one card combos this deck can pull off.&nbsp; Achichi, Pikari, Cynet Mining, Small World, Mathmech Circular.&nbsp; Each of these has their own one card combos.&nbsp; However, Circular is the only one who cannot put up that boad I mentioned earlier on its own.&nbsp; But it is apart of the combo.&nbsp; I will not explain the combo myself.&nbsp; That would take too long.&nbsp; And you might be wondering why I use both Dark Ruler and Evenly Matched in this deck.&nbsp; These are my board breakers along side Lightning Storm and Harpie's Feather Duster.&nbsp; Prohibition is my personal tech option.&nbsp; By declaring a card name neither player can use cards or effects with that cards name unless they are on the field.&nbsp; This is an extra answer to Nibiru.&nbsp; Called By the Grave can help deal with other hand traps such as Ash Blossom and Dimension Shifter.&nbsp; I run all three in my side deck so I can use Crossout on them.&nbsp; That gives me multiple outs to hand traps that would otherwise stop my combos.&nbsp; The board breakers have downsides though.&nbsp; Dark Ruler pevents me from dealing any damage that turn.&nbsp; Evenly skips my battle phase.&nbsp; But Mathmech Circular which is a key combo piece happens to make it so I can only attack with one monster that turn.&nbsp; If you use these all together you will not have to deal with the downsides of Dark Ruler or Circular as Evenly Matched will just skip your battlephase anyway.&nbsp; Which makes the other two cards practically free.&nbsp; I have 90% of the cards in the TCG right now and the rest are coming in the mail.&nbsp; Once Cyberstorm Access comes out where I live, I will buy those remaining three cards.&nbsp; I feel sorry for everybody who has to face me when I am using this deck.&nbsp; Most decks cannot come back from having their board broken and then all of those interuptions if any at all.&nbsp; And in case your wondering why I am running two Dark Infant and an extra Dark Templar in my side deck, it is due to Kashtira.&nbsp; They can banish one card from my extra deck and if they banish either of those two then my deck is good as dead.&nbsp; True King Dinos can do the same thing but to three cards at once.&nbsp; If they go first and pull that off, then it doesn't matter how many of those two I am running, they will banish all of one of them and my combos will no longer work.&nbsp; But going first against that deck is almost an autowin.&nbsp; I thought about everything that could counter this deck.&nbsp; The floodgates included.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is why there are multiple board breakers in the deck that can remove these potential threats.&nbsp; And in case you are wondering how long I have been playing the game...&nbsp; Over everyday for 8 years now.&nbsp; I can use the experience of mine in order to predict what cards my opponent is running in their deck after I see at most 3 cards.&nbsp; I am also a custom card designer in my free time.&nbsp; I only due the cards themselves no the artwork.&nbsp; Someday I would like to commision somebody to design their artworks for me.&nbsp; Although I would feel sorry for them as there is a backlog of almost 2K cards.&nbsp; Most of these are archetypes that I designed myself.&nbsp; Others are legacy support for older archetypes.&nbsp; I even designed Genex Support that actually made the deck good.&nbsp; The trick was to upgrade their consistancy and give them a win condition.&nbsp; That win condition was to give them a boss monster of each attribute which all had effects simular to high powered spell or trap cards.&nbsp; The fire one mimics ring of destruction but doesn't damage the user.&nbsp; The wind one is a harpie's feather duster on legs.&nbsp; You get the point.&nbsp; I will not go any further on those right now.&nbsp; I already typed up so much here.&nbsp; I might go in further detail on a later date.&nbsp; And with that I bid you ado.</p>"

That said, I've added Lady Labrynth of the Silver Castle because, well, she's easily one of the best trap support we have right now. Also Jasmine and Strenae is a great combo for this deck, though, it is not always gonna happen, mostly because of Jasmine link summoning requirement. What rank 4 you will summon with Parallel eXceed depends to what is your board state and possibilites. Sacred Sheep Tree and Trap Track are there for experimentation, but you can swap them for Dugares and Trap Trick respectively.</p>"

INHALE COPIUM WITH ME AND PLAY BRANDED!,"<div class=""elementToProof"">Hey Tearlaments players, are you feeling sad that the recent banlist left your most powerful deck at a mere fraction of it's power? Well, take this COPIUM and build the best competitive way to build using these forsaken mermaids for the April 2023 TCG format!&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><br />As you all know, the most recent TCG banlist has eviscerated Tearlaments as a pure deck. The limitation of every Tearlaments fusion enabler to 1 severely limits the deck's ability to make plays. The ban of Kitkallos eliminates an key crux that holds the strategy together. Currently, I believe the best way to pilot Tearlaments is to use them as an engine alongside other decks they could use as a crutch - and what better fusion deck to put it in than Branded?&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div class=""elementToProof"">Branded Tearlaments combines the incredible fusion powers of both strategies to create a powerful deck capable to deploying multiple strong boss monsters! The main appeal to use this deck over pure Branded is that Branded Tearlaments naturally plays through both of Branded's archnemesis - Ash Blossom and Nibiru. The heavy use of King of the Swamp/Muddy Mudragon enable the use of Rulkallos (negates N<span>ibiru) and Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World (omni-negate). You can summon Grapha/Rulkallos before you use Branded Fusion to guarantee your most important card's resolution!&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Rest assured though, both decks function in perfect harmony and synergy!<br /><br /></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>For the Branded side of this deck, its ratios are maximized to search for Branded Fusion - the most important starter that gets all your plays going. 1 Tragegy, 3 Aluber</span><span>, 3 Branded Opening and 3 Branded Fusion give you 10 ways to Branded fusion in a 42-card deck, so you'll see it in most opening hands. 1 Ad Libitum and 1 Branded in Red are included since it is the bare minimum needed for the Branded in Red -&gt; Guardian Chimera + Mirrorjade combo. Only 2 Albaz is used since you'll be making Lubellion most of the time with Branded Fusion, shuffling back&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>The Tearlament portion of this deck is minimal, consisting of only 6 cards. 3 Perlereino and 1 Terraforming allow you to search for the two maindeck Tears, Scheiren and Havnis. Scheiren (Discard to GY enabler) and Havnis (Handtrap) are chosen for their utility, while Merrli and Reinohart are intentionally left out for the purpose of making this engine as compact as possible. 3 Kashtira Fenrir allow for you to search out Kashtira Tearlaments, another mill enabler.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>1 each of Agido and Kelbek are used since both are mill enablers, and are perfect discards/fusion material.

Cartesia and her advanced fusion form, Granguignol can dump Muddy Mudragon into the GY to act as a separate name and fusion material your maindeck Tearlaments. If you already have King of the Swamp in the GY, you can always send instead Garura for a +1 draw.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>3 King of the Swamp and 1 Polymerization as a search target is included, since they function as specific names when used for fusion material in the GY when fusing with Tearlaments.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span>You've probably noticed that every engine and archetype in this deck are extremely compact and streamlined. This is to enable the use 6 ""flex spots"" in the deck while making the deck as close to 40 as possible. 3 Nibiru and 3 Ash Blossom are auto-includes in a meta dominated by Kashtira and Branded.

The only difference between this and the ""pure"" variant of Branded is that it has another layer of protection and interaction - Tearlaments!

If you milled King of the Swamps/Tragedy/Tearlament girls, you've hit a home run!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span>Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons/mills from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span>Branded Tearlaments lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Backrow floodgates absolutely slaughter Branded, so if you're against an opponent using something like Rivalry of Warlords, it probably is time to proceed to next game! Be sure to side in backrow hate in those match-ups!</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span>&nbsp;Guardian Chimera is the best card to crack open established boards. With it's untargetability, beefy 3300ATK/DEF statline and non-targeting destruction, most boards fall to this offensive juggernaut. If your opponent negates Polymerization/Branded in Red to prevent Chimera from coming out, they have wasted a precious interaction paving the way for you to use Branded Fusion.</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span>Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. </span></li><li class=""elementToProof"">When siding out for games, the best cards to side out are Tearlaments Kashtira and the 2 Ishizu cards.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

This deck has the potential to consistantly sent up the boss monster ""The First of Darklords"" that makes all of your cards untargetable turn one, while also having good amount of offense in breaking boards, stealing your opponents monsters, negating monster/spell effects, all while having great draw power. However before i go into the deck breakdown and tips to use the deck i would like to list a couple disclaimers. I worked on this for around 2 weeks into making and crafting this deck so it isn't going to be perfect, in which i might make updates on the deck even now. Another disclaimer is that this deck is extremely expensive to make and craft in real life, so if you don't have all the pieces and you cannot afford to make this deck then don't worry about it! You can always try the deck at a later time, or you could try it now on a simulator. My advice, you try it on dueling nexus. It's free and it's a pretty fun simulator that's for the TGC in my opinion. One last thing i'd like to mention, in theory crafting i've been contemplating on using some cards since i either used them once on a similar deck, or it feels like it would've synergized well with the deck. I'll be listing these cards in the breakdown as well. Now for the breakdown.</p><p>The Darklord archetype is a theme of high level DARK Fairy monsters that send themselves from the hand to the grave due to their hand effects, then reborn themselves by their boss monster, or by using their spells. Your main way of sending them to the grave will be either fusion, or by Darklord Ixchel's effect(More on this in a second).</p><p>The Despia, or ""Despian"" archetype consists of DARK fairy monsters that loves to take advantage of fusion summoning to add monsters from the deck to hand, protect their monsters from card effects, and special summon themselves after being used to fusion summon. Similar to what Shaddoll's do for their archetype. The despian monsters usually require one despia monster and a light or dark monster to fusion into targets like Masqurade or Quaeritis, or if you have the materials for it then you could summon Proskenion.(But isn't recommended for this deck since it isn't a easy target to make because you don't play many light monsters.)</p><p>These two archetypes are commonly used together since they can easily send eachother to the grave thanks to fusion summoning to gain advantage, having the same card type of DARK Fairy so they can be used for the cost of fusion, and swarm the field thanks to fusion summoning. Your primary way of fusion summoining in this deck will be ""Despia, Theater of the Branded"", since it gives a floating effect, allowing your level 8 or higher fusions to reborn back to the field even if they have been destroyed this turn, and allows for futher fusion on the following turn. Making the field spell your KEY card in this deck.</p><p>The deck's main combo starters are primarily ""Aluber the Jester of Despia"", the ""Induldged Darklord"", and ""Darklord Ixchel"". Ixchel, being a good card to send other darklord cards to graveyard since darklord cards love being in the grave for special summons and effects while also having great draw power. Along with aluber and induldged being the best normal summons in the deck(while ukoback is a decent alternative if neither induldged or aluber is in hand at the current moment). Aluber being able to search for the after mention field spell despia, or other cards if you already have the field spell in hand like ""Branded in Red"" or ""Branded opening"". Induldged being able to seach any darklord monster and add it to the hand at the cost of giving one darklord monster to your opponent from the deck or hand as cost, in which case you could give them Darklord Ukoback. The cards you'd be searching for is Ixchel since she gives further draw power, but depending on the situation and you already have the cards you need you could go for Darklord Superbia.</p><p>Since this deck likes to go first like many decks does, this deck's primary objective is to consistently summon The First Darklord turn one to special summon more fairies from the hand or grave. The more monsters you have in your hand or grave, the more you can summon in the first place. However this deck is also flexible enough to go second since the fusion monsters in the deck(Like the first darklord or quaeritis) have amazing wall breaking potential. I've added the Ishizu cards(Namely Agido and Kelbek since they mil 5 cards from each players deck as long as they get sent from the deck or hand to the grave), Foolish Burial, and Reasoning to mil even more cards and special summon a monster from the deck for free. Foolish Burial is also there to send Despain Tragedy to the grave to add any despia monster to the hand depending on what the situation calls for. However, being very situational you could send the two ishizu cards in the main deck to start sending cards to the grave, but should only ever be used on occasion. Allure of Darkness is another staple for this deck it gives even more drawpower at the cost of banishing a dark monster in your hand as cost, allowing despian tragedy to a great target for this affect. I would like to note that since the ishizu cards aren't dark or light monsters they can't be used to summon heavy hitters like the first darklord, but does have disruption of their own and can be used as a target for Guardian Chimera so they do have decent interaction with this deck.(Also during testing i did use the two other ishizu cards for the main deck being keldo and mudora but most times if they aren't fighting against decks that capitalize in cards being in the grave they'd often feel like dead weight. Which is why i chose to side deck them incase we would fight the mirror, or decks the capitalizes cards in the grave like Phantom Knights or Tearlament). <br />Now for tips and etc..</p><p>- <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59509952"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59509952.jpg"" data-card=""59509952"" data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</span></a> was put into the deck as a floodgate since it could be used for fusion, it wasn't hard to get four fairies in the grave so summoning it using it's effect wouldn't be hard. Or you could summon it using superbia or the first darklords special ability. Do caution when you summon the card, because it locks both players from special summoning. I would advise summoning it during your opponents turn using the first's effect since it's a quick-play affect.</p><p>- This deck has a considerable amount of level 8 monsters that can be easily special summoned. Making it perfect targets for the rank 8 xyz's like draglubion. It allows to special summon a spell negate in Hope Harbringer, or the wall breaker in Numeron Dragon. You could summon either of which depending on the situation of the game. Do not try to go for this play if you activated Branded Opening this turn.&nbsp;</p><p>- <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=25451652"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/25451652.jpg"" data-card=""25451652"" data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</span></a> was put into the deck for two reasons. One, its potential as a boss monster. Two, it allows The First Darklord to activate it's secondary effect to destroy all cards on the opponents side of the field. You'll rarely normal summon this monster since it'll mainly be used to fusion summon, but do not rule out the card's capibility to be a good boss monster itself. The Condemned Darklord helps summon this card greatly</p><p>- The links serves a niche for certain situations. The Condemned Darklord allows you to add any Darklord monster from the deck and either adds it to the hand or send it to the grave at the cost of discarding one card, it also allows you to tribute summon a darklord as a cost of banishing card from your grave instead of using monsters on the field. I:P Masquerena serves as disruption to the opponent because it can summon Knightmare Unicorn on their turn while making the card indestructable, and Linkuriboh is there on the off chance i don't have anything at all but tragedy and allows me to send it to the grave to trigger tragedy's effect.</p><p>- Prioritize using spells before triggering aluber's affect, play with caution. Do your best to make sure aluber's effect goes through. He is usually the key to grabbing Despia.</p><p>- We play two darklord traps in the deck to avoid bricking, and the traps are searchable due to ""Banishment of the Darklords"" being a generic search that can search for any darklord card. They require a darklord for cost of their effect, but you can dodge their cost by using the a darklord monsters effect to copy the card in the grave and re-shuffle it to the deck, but instead you pay 1000 LPs in return of using the darklords effect. You do have the potential to use both effects to be able to use the trap essentially twice during your opponent's turn, which can be devastating. Keep all that in mind.</p><p>- In this deck I play Darklord's bewitchment, and the Sanctified Darklord. Bewitchment being a non-targeting steal an opponent's face-up monster, and Sanctified being a non-targeting face-up monster negate. There is also the traps Darklord's Rebellion which is a non-targeting pop one card on the field and Darklord uprising, which is a trap fusion. You could play rebellion over bewitchment since its a steal over a destroy one card on the field, and uprising has potential since it allows you to summon guardian chimera on the opponents turn without using Branded in Red. Experiment and see which one you prefer but sanctified and rebellion is the more optimal choice.&nbsp;</p><p>- If you're going to use Ixchel's effect, I would recommend using the darklord traps over the monsters and spells since you'll have at least one other body for fusion, but there can be scenarios where sending the monster is the better choice.</p><p>- <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a> was played at two instead of 3 because it was to reduce the chances of bricking. but you can take out more cards to fit your fancy.&nbsp;</p><p>- The side deck is there incase you have to go first and the main deck synergizes well with the cards there. However two odd balls there being Abyss Dweller and Avramax is there for good reason. Dweller is there because it helps a ton against the Phantom Knight mu, and Avramax is there to capitalize on I:P. Dweller you could summon somewhat easily since you play alot of level 4s, Avramax is more niche then anything in the decklist but when summoned it could actually help you close off games. Nibiru was a must have against Kashtira. Lightning storm to better deal with trap decks like Trapix and Labrynth. Dark Ruler no More and Evenly matched is there to better disect boards.</p><p>- If you're going to revive Darklord Superbia, do it after chains. Sometimes when using The First Darklord, the timing activation can miss. Same with darklord contract. Be mindful how you try your chain activations.</p><p>Cards i thought about adding into the decklist consists of...<br />Diviner of the Heralds<br />Starving Venom Fusion Dragon<br />Despian Proskenion<br />Infinte Impermance<br />Darklord Rebellion<br />Darklord Uprising<br />Book of Eclipse<br />Pot of Prosperity&nbsp;<br />Super Polymerzation<br />Forbidden Droplet</p><p>If you guys enjoyed or found this decklist help, let me know in the comment section.

It took me this long to realize that I already had the right cards to make both these archetypes consistent. Because Vijam and Crimson Nova are both fiends, Unchained don't lock you out of them, and you still get your Duza normal summon. Theoretically, if you get another level 4 on the field before Unchained locks you, you can Xyz summon. It's because of that restriction that the extra deck is so sparse. Luckily, the link-2 Knightmares are redundant and just reduce your hand in Unchained decks, so we don't need 'em.</p><p>These two archetypes work incredibly well together, and Small World just bridges the gap even more. There is new Unchained support coming out this month in Japan, and the link-2 is amazing for Cubics, but the new main deck monsters are better used in a purer deck.</p><p>I don't like the Cubic Wave/Crimson Nova otk combo because it depends entirely on your opening hand, with Cubic Spells/Traps being unsearchable, and your opponent having no Spells/Traps to just negate your combo. I just want the special summon, monster immunity, and MAD burn damage.</p><p>I don't have handtraps here because I feel that my consistency would die if I try to shoehorn them in. This deck is not constructed for competition, just playability. That is also the reason why I have no side deck. I'll leave that up to you tournament junkies. I still don't think it's bad enough to call ""casual"", though. If you can make space for handtraps without bricking your every opening hand, go for it and get back to me.</p>"

The deck aims to make Noir on turn 1, and break board by abusing non OPT clauses on purrely cards, back by Adventure engine. The adventure package offers removal in the main deck with illegal knight and dracosack, and negates from griffin to insulate plays. You do give up the normal summon effects, but it is easy to play around since you don't alot of cards during the main phase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are 2 lines that I think is fun. Eppurely Happiness is not once per turn. You can swing with happiness, search happy memory and activate it to prevent a monster your opponnent controls from in battle. At the same time, happiness' non-targetting attack reduction let you chip away at the life point. This lets you attack with Happiness 4 times in 1 turn. This comes with the upside of having 5 material for Noir.</p><p>The second fun line is with PurrelyYeap?! Stacking multiple Sleeping Memory enables multiple draws during SP. PurrelyYeap lets you double those draws. You can draw up to 6 cards during SP! You can also flip this on a Happiness and repeat the previouse line with Expurrely Happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spells are not that great.They are great consistency booster, like Runicks. However, unlike Runick cards, the spells only offer protection(and Sleeping Memory does nothing) if you cannot access the extra deck. The monsters you summon are weenies, and you can't use BP to bait out interactions on cards like IP.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, the non-OPT clause on most Purrely cards makes for a really fun time.&nbsp;</p>"

a simple negate and multi-attacker that can win the game on it's own</p><p>The extra deck is much like handtraps, user preferance. Though these are my card choices you can make changes as you like it.</p><p>Now that we have gotten to this point, I think it's about time to go through combos as few as they are. For the most part the plan is ""summon level 3's"" and that will work enough. However the only real combo's you need to worry about are the predaplant combo and the rank-up combo.</p><p><em>Predaplant combo</em><br />Normal Scorpio &gt; effect discard to summon cobra &gt; effect to add instant fusion &gt; summon Ambulomelides &gt; effect add predaponics &gt;second effect pop cobra for hydra &gt; two 5's to make Vimana in middle collum <br />With this you have your negate at fifth summon so you are free to go even further depending on the cards in you hand. Though ultimately you will want to go through some form of the Ghostrick line into rank-up. <br /><em>Rank-up</em> combo<br />Activate Predaponics &gt; summon cobra &gt; rank two 3's into Alucard &gt; Rank up into Angel &gt; detach Alucard for shot &gt; shot to summon Alucard &gt; (from here you have two paths depending on whether you had access to Rank-Up magic or not) a} if yes; use rank up on Alucard to make Ophion &gt; Opion detach Alucard to add Infestation &gt; Alucard to add shot/ b} if no; turn alucard into another angel &gt; Use to angels to make Utopic future &gt; Alucard to add Shot &gt; Rank up into Draco Future</p><p>Now this deck is really simple, and sometimes simple goes a long way. It has some grind with the recursiveness of Predaponics, Shot, and even Vimana. It's turn-one is strong and it does have a solid power level, however it's ceiling is low and it has an absolute weakness to spell/trap interaction. All in all, it's still a great deck that can be great as a surprise rouge option.</p>"

In all terms, they are good and help out in all means.<br /><br />1. <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=10802915"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/10802915.jpg"" data-card=""10802915"" data-name=""Tour Guide From the Underworld"">Tour Guide From the Underworld</span></a> - it doesn't get any more classic than Tour Guide, she can summom a friend which allows you to get an instant Link-2 while going +1.

what can only be described as the life blood of Phantom knights, being the ""boss monster"" and board builder all in one.</p><p>This extra is tight, with not a lot of compromise. That being said though, the Raidraptor stuff is really just some fun jank and can be pulled if one feels like it. With all these cards laid out we can now see what a normal end board should look like. I won't bore people with all the combo lines so I'll just cover the most optimal one with Tour Guide.</p><p><em>One card full combo</em><br />normal Tour Guide &gt; special Cir &gt; link into Cherubini &gt; Cir effect sumon Scarm to link point &gt; Cherubini effect send Ancient cloak &gt; link monsters to Rusty Bardiche &gt; Bardiche effect send Torn scales set Magic Force &gt; Ancient Cloak effect add Silent Boots &gt; Torn Scales special from grave &gt; special Silent Boots &gt; rank up two 3's into Break Sword at link point &gt; Bardiche effect to pop Sword &gt; Sword effect to summon Boots and Scales &gt; Rank up two 4's into Gagagaga Magician &gt; Magican effect detatch Boots summon Sword &gt; Boots effect add Magic Launch &gt; set/activate Magic Launch as needed for match-up for Ophion</p><p>With just one card you have ended on two pops, as well as a floodgate to stop most problems including Kaiju's. Though if you don't value the floodgate you can just choose to use both your rank-ups to make Dark Rebellion into Dark Requiem so you trade a pop and floodgate for a negate, good all the same though.</p><p>The side deck, is as always, a person player preference. Though mine has a really funny one in the form of double rank-up in Ultimate Falcon and winning with a super towers monster.</p><p>To conclude this a fairly adapable deck that really only has weaknesses against backrow heavy decks, which are more common than one hopes. I would encourage others to take this and try their onw hand at having fun.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Same sort of play style as the old upload, abusing spellcasters and earth monsters for big combos and plenty of consistency and removal but now featuring Cartesia and Quem. 2 new pieces of support which give the deck a whole new level of consistency with Lulu in the extra deck. You now have the added access to fusion summoning such as dusk dragon and Magistus saint Aiwass to steal your opponents combo pieces mid combo. Quem gives the deck more consistency and lets the deck recover more combo pieces such as by link summoning IP and to trigger Quems effect to summon any of the Ecclesia or even fallen of Albaz.<br /><br />----Old upload description----<br /><span><span>The Play style can go in two directions based on your opening hands and opponent. The first is attempt to resolve Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend and go for a link 2, this triggers Archfiends effect to search when it goes to the gy and adds you a possessed spell or trap. Doing this with I:P as the end board target will grant you at least 2 points of disruption on your opponent if we ignore any extra parts of your end board. The other end board options are going for the synchros, namely Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity and locking your opponent out of activating effects based on what is equipped to Zoroa and then backing him up with the charmer/possessed spell and trap line, the Dogmatika members though it is very possible and consistent to end on both Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity and a link 2 in the same turn if you open with the right cards.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>One of the free agent cards is Gravekeeper's shaman. What you do is send Gravekeeper's shaman off of magicians souls and then summon the souls (you can make this more consistent by adding more illusions/Rites). From there summon any level 4 or lower earth monster, in this case we have every nefarious eater of nefariousness, Familiar possessed - Aussa and the Magistus of Grimoire Crowley who can change his attribute and then send the souls and the traptrix to the gy and that will let you summon awakening of the possessed nefariouser archfiend from the deck who's effect is monster reborn on any level 4 or lower so bring back a monster and then link summon away awakening of the possessed nefariouser archfiend and another monster which will then trigger archfiends search effect which will add Possessed partnership, a trap that can summon any 1500 def spellcaster from hand or gy and if you control 2 or more face-up monsters with a different attribute, it becomes non targeting face-up removal as well. This can also be used to summon both Eccelsia, Zoroa, etc who is also in this deck. So what you get is a consistency engine from magicians souls with doubles as both extenders and draw power, A blanket negate all activated monster effects in the gy on a passive effect from gravekeeper's shaman and a powerful removal trap that doesn't target and can be used to summon other cards if needed. This combo is very strong against any deck the uses a lot of monster effects in the gy. This namely includes Tearlament which when timed right (likely after a large mill or they've normal summoned) can end the Tearlaments player's entire game.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous's use is more simple since she is both an extender and a soft super poly enabler by summoning Fallen of Albaz from the hand or deck, making her an amazing surprise option and double removal that can potnetially not eat up your normal going 2nd and removal 2 monsters at once if Ecclesia is summoned using possessed partnership. Incredible Ecclesia also lets the deck run the Albaz fusion monster line up which is very strong as a whole and gives the deck more options and even lets you summon or search Dogmatika monsters by sending titaniklad the ash dragon off of the effect of mirrorjade the iceblade dragon after summoning it by using an oppenets extra deck monster.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Overall the deck is a lot more powerful then it let's on and makes the best use of all the 1500 defence spellcasters has released over the years&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and the support that Konami released with the Charmers structure deck</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;to make a deck with tons of options, adaptability and tech options that can take on even the strongest of meta decks&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>thanks to how powerful it&rsquo;s lock down can potentially can be and it will only get better as Konami releases more spellcaster themes and cards with the prized 1500 def stat line.</span></span></p>"

Archosaur's effect will trigger to destroy the Babycerasaurus summoned from your GY to add Double Evolution Pill and activate the second Babycerasaurus. This Babycerasaurus can summon out one of our Scap Raptors *(Should we have not drawn into all available copies in the deck.) Alternatively you can summon out Giant Rex.</p><p>Moving forward, I will illustrate paths that can be taken with both of these options. As a refresher, our current board would look as follows: 1 Lithosagym, 1 Oviraptor, 1 Animadorned, either 1 Scrap Raptor or Giant Rex, and the potential Doodle Beast - Stego.</p><p>With this current field, we can start digging into our Extra Deck to develop our end board. If we have Scrap Raptor we could use its effect, destroying our Animadorned to give us another Normal Summon of a Scrap Monster. We could then use the Scrap Raptor and the Lithosagym to make Scrap Wyvern, for which I will go over the combo later on.</p><p>If we have Giant Rex we can use Oviraptor and Giant Rex to make ""Evolzar Dolkka"". Alternatively, because we used Animadorned Archosaur's effect to add Double Evolution Pill, we could use the Lithosagym and Giant Rex to make ""I:P Masquerena"". This would give us follow-up during the opponent's turn, and get the Giant Rex in the GY to be banished with Lithosagym off of Double Evolution Pill to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno from our deck. This will trigger the Giant Rex's effect to special summon itself back to the field because it was banished. If we have Stego on field we can use it as the 1 card tribute effect of the Doodle Beast - Tyranno in our hand that we added off of Doodlebook - Uh uh uh!'s GY effect on our opponent's turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scrap Combo</strong></p><hr /><p>Your Scrap Combo enables your Synchro plays. By utilizing the trio of Scrap Raptor, Scrap Chimera, and Scrap Wyvern, you can be presented with a lot of summoning power to push out Synchro monsters from your Extra Deck to make your finished board that much stronger.</p><p>To start, Scrap Raptor can destroy a monster you control, giving you an additional Normal Summon for Scrap monsters. Scrap Raptor can also search out a non-tuner Scrap monster from your deck if it's destroyed by the effect of a Scrap monster. This effect easily plays into itself as Scrap Raptor can be its own target for its first effect. You're searching out Scrap Chimera with this effect, and Scrap Chimera can Special Summon a Scrap tuner monster. While Chimera can't be used as a Synchro material for anything other than a Scrap monster, it can still act as generic Link material. Scrap Wyvern is a Link-2 monster that needs two monsters including a Scrap monster to summon. It can bring back a Scrap monster from your GY to your field and then it destroys one card you control. Its other effect lets you Special Summon a Scrap monster from deck when a Scrap monster is destroyed while its on the field and then destroy any 1 card on the field, non-targeting. Your combo in action will look something like this:</p><p>Scrap Raptor Effect &gt; Destroy itself to give additional Normal Summon &gt; Scrap Raptor Effect to Add Scrap Chimera &gt; Normal Summon Scrap Chimera &gt; Scrap Chimera Effect to Revive Scrap Raptor &gt; Link Scrap Raptor + Chimera into Scrap Wyvern &gt; Wyvern Effect to Revive Scrap Raptor then Destroying Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Chimera Trigger Effect to Special Summon another Scrap Raptor from Deck.</p><p>Suppose you refer back to the above True King Combo -- we ended on a fair number of monsters on our board with that. If we go through that same example and have a Scrap Raptor instead of Giant Rex, we could use the Scrap Raptor to destroy the Animadorned Archosaur and then use Scrap Raptor and Lithosagym to make Wyvern. This play would allow us to use the Wyvern to bring back the Scrap Raptor and destroy it, triggering both Wyvern and Raptor's effects at the same time and allowing you to Chain Block. This lets you insulate one of the cards on the chain from something like ""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"".</p><p>Because this combo produces a level 4 Tuner, you have a couple of options to play with in the Extra Deck. I've gone with two options in this deck: Borreload Savage Dragon as it can act as a negate against almost any card, and Geomathmech Final Sigma because it can be made off of a Doodle Beast - Tyranno and a Scrap Raptor, and it's funny. Feel free to play around with other options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dinosaur Combo</strong></p><hr /><p>The Dinosaur combo is your main show. It's what is going to give you access to almost all of your deck, and let you do very powerful plays that end on a variety of monsters that act as disruption. Your main playmaker is Souleating Oviraptor. It can add a Dinosaur from your deck to your hand and it can revive a dino from your GY be destroying a different dino on your field. I'll go over what a combo with Oviraptor will generally look like:</p><p>Summon Souleating Oviraptor and Activate Effect to Search &gt; Add Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus in the GY &gt; Summon Animadorned Archosaur &gt; Animadorned Archosaur Effect Destroy a Dinosaur *(Optimally you want to destroy either Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon with the effect of Animadorned Archosaur so you can get an additional summon out of them)* &gt; Add Double Evolution Pill.</p><p>If we start Oviraptor + Miscellaneousaurus, Oviraptor + Fossil Dig, or Miscellaneousaurus + Fossil Dig, you can use the Oviraptor to search out one of your recruiter Dinosaurs to use for the destruction effect of Animadorned Archosaur we'll summon off of Miscellaneousaurus.</p><p>If we have a recruiter Dinosaur like Babycersaurus we can destroy it with Animadorned's effect to add the Double Evolution Pill. The Babycerasaurus's effect can summon out a Petiteranodon. You can then proceed to use your established Oviraptor to destroy the Petiteranodon and summon the Babycerasaurus back from the GY. Petiteranodon's effect will activate, letting you summon Scrap Raptor from the deck.</p><p>In this current position, we can use the Scrap Raptor's effect to destroy the Babycersaurus to gain an additional Normal Summon of a Scrap monster. Then the Babycerasaurus can summon out either Giant Rex to act as an extender. By using it and Scrap Raptor to make Scrap Wyvern, or to summon the second Petiteranodon to destroy at the end of the Scrap Wyvern's last effect to summon out a Dinowrestler Pankratops from the deck. This acts as disruption for the opponent's next turn. *(Refer to above Scrap Combo for more details.)</p><p>There are uses for each option. Summoning out Giant Rex gives you the ability to later use it as one of the banished materials for Double Evolution Pill or even Ultimate Conductor Tyranno if you drew into it. Giant Rex could then summon itself back out to then be made into an Evolzar Dolkka or an Evolzar Laggia with the Souleating Oviraptor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tech Choices and Final Thoughts</strong></p><hr /><p>To elucidate some of my Extra Deck choices, I will go over why I've decided to play specific choices and suggest alternatives. To start I've decided to play Linkuriboh + Secure Gardna because in some scenarios it can be used to turn Animadorned Archosaur into a 1-card Ultimate Conductor Tyranno by ising the Animadorned to summon Linkuriboh and then use the Linkuriboh to summon Secure Gardna. This lets the Double Evolution Pill banish the Secure Gardna + Animadorned to summon UCT from deck.</p><p>Likewise I'm playing Bagooska for if there's ever a hand I have where I can't do too much beyond summoning 2 level 4s that don't get the combo fully going if the rest of the hand isn't optimal. It also has some <span data-dobid=""hdw"">niche utility in games where you can link climb into Accesscode Talker to close out the game while keeping your opponent's on-field monsters at bay.<br /></span></p><p><span data-dobid=""hdw"">I'm playing Linguriboh as a way to out Knightmare Corruptor Iblee. Spright players can take advantage of Knightmare Corruptor Iblee by having it special summon to your side of the field, locking you out of special summoning anything except Link monsters. Spright players will try to set this up with a I:P Masquerena as a way to make Knightmare Unicorn and bounce your normal summon back to hand, stopping you from making a Link-2 with your normal summon and Iblee. The Linguriboh gives you a safe way to remove it from your field with no commitment attached. It also has the benefit of being a trap card negate, which could come up against something like Infinite Impermanence or Evenly Matched.</span></p><p><span data-dobid=""hdw"">I'm playing Abyss Dweller as tool to shut down GY centralized decks. It can easily shut down a lot of different archetypes and is farily accessible with the amount of level 4 monsters we have the ability to summon out.</span></p><p><span data-dobid=""hdw"">Other choices could include cards like Knightmare Phoenix or Tornado Dragon as a way to destroy Spells/Traps. Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder can be played as a payoff for attacking with an XYZ monster giving you a quick effect board wipe. PSY-Framelord Omega can be played as a way to rip cards out of your opponent's hand, as well as being able to return itself and another card in the GY back to the deck. Underworld Goddess of the Closed World can be utilized as a way to get rid of big monsters with a lot of protection on your opponent's side of the field. </span></p><p><span data-dobid=""hdw"">The Dinosaur deck is a fun toolboxy deck that has a lot of power to do a lot of powerful plays. Its extra deck can be tinkered with a lot to the pilot's preferences. The main deck offers a nice amount of versaility in summoning boss monsters as well. With cards like Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, Dinowrestler Pankratops, and Doodle - Beast Tyranno the deck has a fair amount of big monsters that can close out games. The intoruduction of the Doodle Beast cards can help act as a bridge for some combos depending on what your opening hand looks like. It gives you slightly more options to go into through your combo.</span></p><p><span data-dobid=""hdw"">I hope you enjoy this deck and always feel free to try out whatever you like and play it however you feel comfortable. See this sort of as a starting pad to work off of. I hope you've found this profile helpful and informative and happy dueling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Archetype monsters have the&nbsp;<strong>mechanic of needing Normal Monsters</strong>&nbsp;to activate certain effects and using Normal Monsters in 2023 is not an option.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>archetype's Fusion</strong>&nbsp;is a good card but nothing worth having to use&nbsp;<strong>Vanilla and Cross Sheep</strong>&nbsp;to use it. Of course, there is the argument that it has&nbsp;<strong>great synergy with Tyranno</strong>, being able to be destroyed and return to the field and add a follow up to the hand and still destroy cards, but even so, this is<strong>&nbsp;only consistent in the ideal scenario where you don't get hand traps</strong>.</p><p>The same goes for&nbsp;<strong>RANK-6 that can recycle from banished zone Miscellaneousaurus</strong>&nbsp;which is just an Ok card since the deck already has efficient ways to recycle the banned Miscellaneousaurus as&nbsp;<strong>Psy-Frame Omega</strong>&nbsp;and yet the vanilla needed to do it is the worst possible because must be lv6.</p><p>Finally&nbsp;<strong>all moves involving this archetype lose to Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>&nbsp;among other hand traps mainly in the moves of the Scrap Raptor engine,&nbsp;<strong>lock you in certain types of extra deck monsters</strong>&nbsp;that don't help you much when you go second since they are end board cards and not field-breaking cards in addition to the fact that you have an&nbsp;<strong>extra deck worsened by using cards that only make sense if the combo passes completely</strong>&nbsp;without taking interactions like Cross-Sheep and RANK-6.</p><p>This again means using the Dinosaur deck in the wrong way. I've already said in other deck profiles that&nbsp;<strong>there's no point in making beautiful combo plays</strong>&nbsp;with Apollousa + Savage etc to&nbsp;<strong>lose to several hand traps and on top of that not having any follow up</strong>&nbsp;if the opponent uses Dark Ruler No More and cleans his field. It's always better if you&nbsp;<strong>make combos that have more resilience</strong>&nbsp;to hand traps, continue to have great interactions and have a lot of follow up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Positive points of using Spell and the new Tuner lv6:</strong></p><p><strong>1 -</strong>&nbsp;The Spell greatly&nbsp;<strong>increases the consistency of the deck</strong>&nbsp;because it plays the same role as the&nbsp;<strong>Dragonic Diagram</strong>, but I believe in a&nbsp;<strong>better way</strong>. Since now using at least 3 Babycerasaurus and 1 Petiteranodon is mandatory in the deck to be able to&nbsp;<strong>start plays without spending Normal Summon</strong>.</p><p><strong>2 -</strong>&nbsp;The spell does&nbsp;<strong>not need to add Lv6</strong>&nbsp;so in many combos it is better to&nbsp;<strong>add Scrap Raptor</strong>&nbsp;which is a great Normal Summon and makes a combo with Lost World and Miscellaneousaurus.</p><p><strong>3 -</strong>&nbsp;Regarding the Lv6 Tuner, its main advantages are that you can&nbsp;<strong>create a Lost World token</strong>&nbsp;and protect yourself from the&nbsp;<strong>target of cards without spending the Normal Summon</strong>. This whether going first or second is great for&nbsp;<strong>starting plays</strong>&nbsp;against target interactions.</p><p><strong>4 -</strong>&nbsp;As he is a&nbsp;<strong>Lv6 tuner</strong>&nbsp;along with any Lv4 monster he&nbsp;<strong>makes Baronne de Fleur</strong>&nbsp;which is the best Synchro-10 in the game and brings a&nbsp;<strong>lot of versatility to the deck</strong>&nbsp;both by denying cards and destroying as well which&nbsp;<strong>improves the combos going first as well</strong>. Just for that fact the card is already very good because Baronne de Fleur means forcing at least 2 interactions from the opponent.</p><p><strong>5 -</strong>&nbsp;By indication, the combos involving&nbsp;<strong>Lost World and Xeno Meteoros as an extender have the synergy</strong>&nbsp;of you being able to access&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Cerberus</strong>&nbsp;to destroy the Token on the opponent's side and make a Full Combo. It basically&nbsp;<strong>replaces the Doodle Beast</strong>&nbsp;in the deck by doing the same role only much better.</p><p><strong>6 -</strong>&nbsp;These cards have very good synergies in the deck and are very viable in all possible versions of Dinosaur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////So after saying what I think about the supports, let's see in practice the use of the new archetype in the Dinosaur deck:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example you can do the following combos:</p><p><strong>Spell + Oviraptor = Spell + Babycerasaurus/Petiteranodon</strong></p><p>One of the main novelties is that you can&nbsp;<strong>easily access Baronne de Fleur</strong>&nbsp;which means it is a&nbsp;<strong>protection against hand traps</strong>&nbsp;in addition to being an extender for your combos going first because&nbsp;<strong>it can destroy any card on the field</strong>, whether it is Babycerasaurus or Token on the opponent's field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Spell + Miscellaneousaurus combo</strong>&nbsp;is also possible and pretty much the same combo as&nbsp;<strong>Miscellaneousaurus + Scrap Raptor</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Spell + Scrap Raptor combo</strong>&nbsp;brings good possibilities going second by accessing&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong>&nbsp;which is a card that manages to force at least 2 interactions from the opponent since it destroys and negates cards in addition to being a follow up in the Standby Phase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The combo involving you&nbsp;<strong>Special Summoning the Lv6 Tuner and doing LINK-2 Knightmare Cerberus</strong>&nbsp;or Fur Hire to destroy the token on the opponent's side to trigger Lost World and start playing is really good.</p><p>Just the fact that you can&nbsp;<strong>Special Summon the Lv6 Tuner along with your normal summon with Lost World activated on the field allows you to play even after being hand trapped in normal</strong>&nbsp;as an Infinite Impermanence. In case if the card he denies is the Oviraptor you can make Baronne de Fleur and destroy the token. If it's the Scrap Raptor you can continue playing normally by doing the Scrap Wyvern. These combos have a weaker end board but are already something better than being hand trapped in Normal Summon and simply passing the turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////RESUME:</strong></p><p>The deck is&nbsp;<strong>very consistent with the new supports</strong>&nbsp;whether in the pure version or with the Ogdoadic. This spell can make you&nbsp;<strong>start moves without spending your normal summon</strong>&nbsp;among other great synergies like throwing bricks from the hand deck to the gy.</p><p>I don't doubt if they can use an engine involving this spell in other decks because it's practically a lv6 extender tuner that enters the field and allows you mainly to make Synchro-10 plays being the second best option besides Baronne de Fleur or Bystial Des Pair that It's a great card in the Chaos deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One detail that I noticed in the&nbsp;<strong>pure version</strong>&nbsp;is that you have a&nbsp;<strong>lot of consistency spell cards</strong>&nbsp;but you&nbsp;<strong>don't have space for tech cards</strong>&nbsp;so that's why I created the&nbsp;<strong>60-card version</strong>&nbsp;that has the role of adding more go secund cards so you have chances going second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////<strong>NEW COMBOS WITH TRANSCENDRAKE CARDS:</strong></p><p>complete the continuation of the URL on the website&nbsp;duelingbook.com/</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46645974</p><p><strong>Combo 1: (Oviraptor + Ground Xeno) = Full Combo</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Number 38 + Baronne + Omega/Dweller</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46899587</p><p><strong>Combo 1.1: Lost World + (Babyberasaurus/Petiteranodon/Oviraptor + Ground Xeno) = Full Combo NOT RECOMMENDED</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Number 23 + Baronne / Banished: Omega (You should have only made Number 23 at the end)</p><p>(Less optimized version because you use Miscellaneousaurus to bring Archosaur and don't use&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fleur's effect</strong>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46646405</p><p><strong>Combo 1.2: Lost World + (Babycerasaurus/Petiteranodon + Ground Xeno)</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Number 38 + Baronne + Giant Rex + Linkuriboh</p><p>(Version without make Scrap Wyvern)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-47654976</p><p><strong>COMBO 2: Lost World + Oviraptor + Ground Xeno = (FULL COMBO MOST RECOMMENDED - PLAY AROUND NIBIRU AND HAND TRAPS)</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Baronne + Number 23 /Banished: Omega /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Giant Rex /Opponent lose 1 card in Hand</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-47655916</p><p><strong>COMBO 3: Lost World + Babycerasaurus + Ground Xeno = (FULL COMBO PSY-Framelord Omega Version - PLAY AROUND NIBIRU AND HAND TRAPS)</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Baronne + Omega + I:P Masquerena /Opponent start turn with 4 cards in Hand</p><p>(Also has a demonstration of possible moves in your next turn)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-47655155</p><p><strong>COMBO 3.1: Lost World + Babycerasaurus + Ground Xeno = (FULL COMBO OMEGA VERSION - PLAY AROUND NIBIRU AND HAND TRAPS)</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Baronne + Omega + I:P Masquerena /Opponent lose 2 cards in Hand</p><p>(Demonstration of follow up by Baronne de Fleur in your next turn)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46674233</p><p><strong>Combo 4: (Ground Xeno + Miscellaneousaurus) = Scrap Raptor + Miscellaneousaurus</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-46674390</p><p><strong>Combo 4.1: (Ground Xeno + Scrap Raptor) + Random Card = (Ground Xeno + Xeno Meteors + Random Card)</strong></p><p>Gamestate: Baronne de Fleur + Keurse</p><p>Blind Second = Possibility to make Dingirsu and AA-Zeus.

Miscellaneous WIND monsters such as&nbsp;<strong>The Tricky&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Red Hared Hasty Horse&nbsp;</strong>serve as self-explanatory extenders to make the higher level synchro monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>*Note that other notable Speedroid monsters such as <strong>Terrortop </strong>or <strong>Marble Machine</strong> are also great alternatives to serve as the deck master instead of <strong>Ultra Hound </strong>to perform one-card combos.&nbsp;The latter is just one example and does not have to be relied on 100% of the time to get the engine running.</p>"

I tried to make this deck as consistent as possible with what is available in Link Evolution.,"<p>This build is an update to my Master Of Fate Endymion Deck which you can find here:<br /><a href=""/deck/master-of-fate-endymion-deck-227951"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/master-of-fate-endymion-deck-227951</a></p><p>This deck is super bricky, so I had to drop some cards that literally add no value whatsoever going 1st. This build is way less brickier, but you need to be careful with how you play your cards because this deck requires precision due to lack of any valuable spell cards or engines in Link Evolution.<br />If I have to rate the difficulty of this deck, it would 5/5. The more you play this deck, the easier you can identify combo routes.<br /><br />For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

The first because it detach material as an effect and can <strong>trigger Tearlaments eff</strong> and the second because it is <strong>lv6 and facilitates access to Beatrice</strong>.</p><p>Overall I'm very satisfied with the performance of this deck and it has many ways to improve when <strong>testing the deckbuild</strong>.</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>"

I'm thinking of about 45 cards but would want more hand traps and not hurting consistency. any help/suggestion would be appreciated!</p><p>used crossout as a marker to split between archetypes (if it displays correctly)</p><p>Ghoti melffy synchro v1: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/ghoti-melffy-synchrp-315705"">https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/ghoti-melffy-synchrp-315705</a></p><p>My previous deck has some really explosive plays during my opponents turn and is very hard to stop unless they use field wipes at the very start which is surprisingly a huge weakness after I ate a lot of lava golems, ra eggs etc in locals.&nbsp;</p><p>I started to notice that the plays I can make my first turn are usually setting up plays (ss melffies at the end phase and banishing ghotis so they can explode in my opponents turn)</p><p>By adding spright into them I should be able to get more bodies on the field such as spright red/carrot, smashers to banish a ghoti, IP or some generic links to provide interuptions as well as forcing my oppoenet to deal with both my ghoti melffy line and my spright/link xyz line making my plays more solid and hard to completely interupt. The lv2 restriction from spright starters/gigantic spright matters little since the majority of my plays are in my opponents turn</p><p>Accel synchro stardust is a very interesting card and if paired with a ghoti tuner on field (ss by its own effect in the opponents turn): you can either use Accel's effect to get a stardust and synchro into Deep Beyond/Ruddy Rose or use the ghoti tuner to go into Deep Beyond. The opponent will need to spend 2 monster negates to fully stop this or face a board/grave banish. not to mention how easy it is to make Accel through the melffy searchers with pinny or hop ear.</p><p>As usual the side deck are cards that could be build into the deck for potentially more plays/consistency</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Fabled,"<p>This is a very no-brainer deck i made after seeing a video on youtube with greed quasar 5million levels and i said that ""yeah i can make that without the new dark world support"".....<br /><br />Anyways deck revolves around using dark world dealing to yeet ceruli, ceruli discard lucent, lucent throws greed quasar FROM DECK to opponents side in attack position then you do everything in your power to end on borreload dragon and colossal fighter on your field with chicken game or pseudo space copying chicken game. +50 style points if you end up with calculator as well which can be revived with spright elf. you go to battle phase and attack to greed quasar with colossal fighter infinitely until you are satisfied with its level and attack, yoink with borreload dragon and finally attack for game either with quasar or calculator.&nbsp;<br /><br />A/D changer is a must cause otherwise you might have to include some infernity engine to do piercing damage or pentestag, A/D changer can turn one of our ceruli we gift our opponent to attack position. or you can use it to flip morphing jar which can be removed from the deck. Pot of Avarice and Slash draw cards are a must cause if you start with quasar you are pretty much screwed so you can recycle it with those cards after drawing ceruli and lucent and immediately throw it to opponents side for the loop.<br /><br />The deck is very weak against called by and nibiru but it can definetly play around ash or maxx c thanks to humongous amount of drawing cards and card destruction. dont be afraid to throw greed quasar and calculator to the graveyard so you can recycle them. Dark allure targets are mostly level 3 danger monsters if not level 4 danger monsters.<br /><br />I couldnt make it more consistent cause i feel like i always draw too much and fall short on special summons or maybe summon incorrectly so i cannot end on calculator all the time. I am open to suggestions since its hard to pull up. the deck is a going 2nd deck obviously since you OTK with 100k/300k hit if you are fast enough.</p>"

Saryuja and other Link monsters can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The True Sun God"" is just a filler that tutors ""Ancient Chant"". Thus, 30 UR is saved!</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>- ""Reversal Quiz"" can be found from ""Legacy Pack"". Hope you were lucky to get one for free to save 30 SR.</p><p>- ""Moray of Greed"" can be a good and cheap alternative for drawing cards. Just remove 3xExodia+Flamvell to add 4xWater monsters alongside Moray and you're good to go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 30 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

The deck's strategy revolves around the ""A.I. Land"" and ""Ignister A.I.Land"" Field Spells, which provide various effects that help to swarm the field and protect your monsters.</p><p>The deck's main monster lineup consists of ""Pikari @Ignister,"" ""Doyon @Ignister,"" ""Achichi @Ignister,"" ""Bururu @Ignister,"" and ""Hiyari @Ignister,"" which can be easily Special Summoned from the hand or deck by the Field Spell cards. These monsters have powerful effects that can search other ""@Ignister"" monsters, destroy cards on the field, or negate the opponent's monster effects.</p><p>The deck also includes several Fusion Monsters like ""Dark Templar @Ignister,"" ""Light Dragon @Ignister,"" ""Water Leviathan @Ignister,"" ""Wind Pegasus @Ignister,"" and ""Earth Golem @Ignister,"" which can be easily summoned with the help of ""A.I. Love Fusion"" and the Field Spell cards. These Fusion Monsters have powerful effects that can destroy cards on the field, negate the opponent's card effects, or deal damage directly to the opponent.</p><p>The deck also includes a few Synchro and Xyz Monsters, like ""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"" and ""Cyberse Wicckid,"" which can be used to gain field advantage or deal massive damage to the opponent.</p><p>Overall, the ""@Ignister"" Deck is a fast and aggressive deck that can quickly swarm the field with powerful monsters and shut down the opponent's plays with its various effects. The deck's reliance on Field Spells and Special Summoning makes it vulnerable to cards that can negate or destroy its Spells and Traps, but the inclusion of ""Infinite Impermanence"" and ""Called by the Grave"" can help to mitigate this weakness.</p>"

There will be inconsistencies and problems with deck building. Most of the time it will create a deck either under 40 cards or randomly have extra deck cards in the main deck. I've done some fine tuning whilst trying to not impact too much what ChatGPT has made.<br /><br />A short description made by ChatGPT about how the deck functions.<br /><br /></p><p>The ""ABC"" Deck is a Machine-Type archetype that focuses on the use of the Union monsters ""A-Assault Core,"" ""B-Buster Drake,"" and ""C-Crush Wyvern"" to summon the powerful Fusion Monster ""ABC-Dragon Buster."" The deck's strategy relies heavily on the use of the Spell Card ""Union Hangar,"" which allows the player to search for any Union monster from the deck and equip it to a Machine-Type monster on the field.</p><p>The deck's main monsters, the A, B, and C Union monsters, can be easily summoned from the hand or deck with the help of the Gadget monsters or other support cards like ""Reinforcement of the Army"" and ""Foolish Burial."" Once on the field, they can be equipped with ""Union Hangar"" to summon the powerful ""ABC-Dragon Buster.""</p><p>The deck also includes various Spells and Traps, like ""Called by the Grave,"" ""Cosmic Cyclone,"" and ""Infinite Impermanence,"" which can help to disrupt the opponent's plays and protect the player's monsters.</p><p>The Extra Deck includes various Link Monsters, like ""Crystron Halqifibrax,"" ""Linkuriboh,"" and ""Platinum Gadget,"" which can help to extend the player's plays and make it easier to summon ""ABC-Dragon Buster."" The inclusion of ""Number 39: Utopia"" and ""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"" also allows the player to deal significant damage to the opponent.</p><p>Overall, the ""ABC"" Deck is a powerful and versatile deck that can quickly summon its main monster, ""ABC-Dragon Buster,"" to control the field and defeat the opponent. The deck's reliance on the Union monsters makes it vulnerable to cards that can banish or destroy them, but the inclusion of cards like ""Called by the Grave"" and ""Solemn Strike"" can help to mitigate this weakness.</p>"

This deck fixes that while also being cheap and easy to build. It doesn't have a TON of combo lines, but it's fun to play and makes them at least playable in a casual, or possibly even semi-competitive setting.</p><p>So your main play-starters are going to be Unexpected Dai, Pebble Dog, Rock Hammer, or Widget Kid.</p><p>Use Unexpected Dai to summon out one of your vanilla Cyberses, link it off into Link Spider, use Link Spider's effect to summon out another Vanilla from your hand (if you have one), and link those off into Stubborn Mehnir. Then you just need one more material on the field (you haven't even used up your Normal Summon at this point, but make sure your last material is a Cyberse monster. Ash Blossom won't link into anything) and you can link Mehnir with your other material to summon Crystal Heart. Use Crystal Heart's effect to revive Mehnir and trigger its effect to special summon and&nbsp;<em><strong>effect&nbsp;</strong></em>monster from your GY (you should have at least one, unless you&nbsp;<strong>only&nbsp;</strong>drew vanilla monsters and no searchers) and link off Mehnir and the revived monster to summon Transcode Talker (which is why you need an effect monster) and use its effect to revive Mehnir. If you have another way to get a monster on the board (which isn't difficult with this deck, I find that I have a way to do so more often than not) then you can link off Mehnir with your last material(s) to summon Invalid Dolmen or Dignified Trilithon. If you&nbsp;<strong>don't</strong> have another material, you can link off Transcode and Mehnir to make Dolmen, which renders both Crystal Heart and Dolmen immune to your opponent's monster effects.</p><p>This is your main combo line, but there are a ton of different variations to make it work. Rock Hammer's effect can send Dotscaper to the graveyard to Normal Summon itself and turns into&nbsp;<em>minimum&nbsp;</em>4 materials on its own, 6 if you have a vanilla monster in hand (Link Spider into Mehnir into Crystal Heart). Pebble Dog and Painful Decision both give you easy ways to get Gravity Balance to come online, Widget Kid gives you 2 materials for free, Bitrooper can also discard Dotscaper&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>Pebble Dog to get an additional material or a search for Gravity Balance or Rock Hammer.</p><p>This isn't a highly meta deck, the best board I've been able to end on with this deck is Crystal Heart, Transcode Talker, and Dignified Trilithon, which isn't incredible, but it gives you a targeted-effect negate and two beefy monsters, and can turn into a solid OTK strategy due to Crystal Heart turning Transcode into a 3400 beater with piercing damage that can attack twice, allowing Dolmen or Trilithon to swing for game.</p><p>As far as Accesscode goes, you don't really&nbsp;<strong>need&nbsp;</strong>Accesscode. It's good to have, since the highest attack you can get with any consisitency is 3700, making certain decks really difficult to get over, so if you arrive at your end board and find that your opponent still has something you can't attack over, Accesscode gives you an option to pop it. You get two pops since you'll have an EARTH and a WATER in your GY, but at most you'll have 3 pops if you've used Ash Blossom that game, and without Update Jammer Accesscode isn't an OTK on its own.</p><p>Overall, the deck is fun, effective, and cheap, and the most effective way I've found to play the G Golem engine. It's kind've like an ""Accesscode-At-Home"" kinda deck, but I enjoy it and I hope you will, too!</p>"

The best interaction you can have with this card is to add Metaphys Ascension while you have Asymmetaphys. Use Asymmetaphys' effect to banish Metaphys Ascension drawing one card and adding 1 Metaphys card from your deck to your hand.<br />- Metaphys Daedalus &amp; Metaphys Nephthys are a great duo when it comes to triggering both their effects when special summoned by the effect of a Metaphys monster. First, you add either one of them to your hand through Metaphys Nephthys, then you banish Metaphys Tyrant Dragon using Metaphys Daedalus' effect. On the next turn, Metaphys Tyrant Dragon special summons either Daedalus or Nephthys for a board wipe (special summoned monsters or set spell &amp; trap cards).<br />- Aloof Lupine facilitates the access to certain interactions and the best one of all if you open it with Necroface. That's 10 cards banished. You can also use Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring as a bridge to Necroface since both of them are a zombie.</p><p>In the current meta, please drop the Nemeses cards for the best one: Nemeses Keystone. Regarding the extra deck, you can adjust it with the best cards in the current meta like Baronne De Fleur and Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</p><p>For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

The deck also includes various Spells and Traps, like ""Abyss Script - Abyssal Playhouse Fantastic Theater"" and ""Abyss Actors' Curtain Call,"" which can help to disrupt the opponent's plays and protect the player's monsters.</p><p>The Extra Deck includes various Xyz Monsters, like ""Abyss Dweller,"" ""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir,"" and ""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon,"" which can help to control the field and deal damage to the opponent.

What I forgot about was that the 250th YCS was going on the week I was recording the video, and the fact that Kashtira has peaked into the metagame. What I also just noticed is that Dark Magician (the archetype) can also work well with the Kashtira cards as an extra step towards XYZ extensions. Even without one or the other, both can hold their own in their own way as I had experimented this week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For the Dark Magician package, I went with the Dragoon package to feed off of ""Eternal Soul"" and ""Dark Magical Circle"". All by milling ""Dark Magician"" from the deck and Special summoning him next turn with ""Eternal Soul"" (triggering the effect of ""Dark Magical Circle"") .I also had the option of adding ""Dark Magician The Dragon Knight"" to the deck, which is fusion summoned using the spell card ""Secrets of Dark Magic"". I haven't used this often due to not having a good chance of a ""Magician's Rod"" nor being able to always play ""Timaeus the United Dragon"". The XYZ monster, ""Ebon Illusion Magician"" was used for this deck to special summon ""Dark Magician"" for Kashtira XYZ extensions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Kashtira's side of the fence seem pretty rudimentary as always: with ""Kashtira Fenrir"" and ""Kashtira Unicorn"" being the centerpieces for search monsters and spells for the archetype; ""Kashtira Riseheart"" being the miller (and sometimes triggering certain effects of Kashtira spells if banished, such as ""Kashtiratheosis""); and Tearlaments/Scareclaw Kashtira being lore pieces that are good for some reason. The XYZ monsters (in my opinion) are what truly make the deck into the siege weapon it was meant to be: from ""Dark Armed, The Dragon of Annihilation"" and the endless destruction looping (and material feeding for ""Kashtira Arise-Heart""), to ""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"" and the Extra Deck cherrypicking with the possible deck destruction on top of it. This alone is what truly proves that regardless of what gets thrown at them (or what ridiculous hybrids Kashtira gets mixed into), they somehow still seem to do just fine. They are just that good at carrying on their own or with another archetype you happen to put them with (within reason).</p>"

Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</p></div><p>This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.<br /><br />While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.<br /><br />I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!<br /><br />Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!<br /><br />The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell). This weakness is avoided with Pot of Prosperity and Maxx ""C"" functioning as cards that will get you starters for the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You have some backrow removal and ways to mill. Overall the deck functions smoothly when you don't draw your brick cards and is pretty combo heavy.</p><p>This deck isn't exactly consistent or tournament ready, but it is pretty fun to pull off if you can.</p>"

Was considering Nibiru, but Kashtira is less prevelant and people are playing around it better, so I figured Kaijus in side to help with any big boss monsters. Super Poly for Branded. I wanted to have 3 options for Edge Imp Chains search (assuming you hard draw Pathwork) Frightfur Reborn for I:P play, Factory if you're unable to get all the fusions you need and Fusion as a Miracle Fusion. Side deck is mostly meta calls, from my experience Fluffals struggle with trap heavy decks which is why Evenly Matched, was consdering swapping Dark Holes for Twin Twisters / Cosmic Cyclones. Dark Holes are for locks, Iblee (for mathmechs since they CAN play it) Imperm as a good going 2nd card, unsure if it's better than Ash right now. <br /><br />Hope you enjoyed, thank you for looking at the deck list!<br />Have a great rest of your day :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Have been having a lot of success with it, especially against Naturia/Runick, not much practice against Kashtira but it should do relatively well, I'll update this next week after some more practice. In the main deck, I simply replaced the Simorgh package with 2 Harpie Harpist, a Terraforming, and a Feather Duster, and I replaced my 3 Book of Eclipse for 3 Book of Moon because I feel like you mostly only need to book 1 card, and this one can't be ashed.</p><p>I also changed the side deck a little from the Simorgh variant, I felt like Advent was not enough to play for time, as it can only be used if you start, which won't always be the case game 3 so I added Dogwood. I also think Dark Hole is a good card to have in this meta, and I found D Barrier redundant with Feather Storm already in the side, so I simply added a trap trick to use as a 4th copy of Feather Storm. Nibiru is the big ""if"" in this list... It is basically only useful going 2nd, and only if you have it in your opening hand, but it helps play against Kashtira if they try the full combo.</p>"

Your trade: Your locked out of card effects when I activate mine.,"<p>This is the broken new Dark Magician Lock. The Dark Magicians can easily abuse Powersink to draw cards on your opponents while your opponent is locked out of monster effects before the Main Phase starts. Lmfao The Dark Magicians are super OP more than Dragon Knight and Dragoon. Damn! 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😆😆😆😆</p><p>If you have 2 The Dark Magicians, Secret Village, and Powersink all on the field on your opponents turn, its game over. Lmfao. Even worst, Souls can act as another draw engine to draw into your Exodia pieces. This is insanely good! DM players shouldve thought of this idea already lmfao. Its the new Mystic Mine but better than Mystic Mine. I guess you could call this deck the new Yata Lock.&nbsp;</p><p>Edit: Decklist is an idea for which cards to use to play against meta. The actual decklist is forbyou to figure out alone.</p><p>Meta decks cannot get over this deck until its with generic handtraps and it would have to depend because the handtrap thing wouldnt even matter at this point. Evenly Match could stop this deck but I doubt it. Lmfao. You could setup another Trap negate so it wouldnt matter. Just beaten Kashtiras again with this deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Will show example in the comments! Thanks!</p>"

I made an assumption that was wrong. The card can be played from HAND and GY. I must be tripping -.-<br />- Since there is no way to put Rescue Ferret back in the deck, I added a second copy to mitigate the chance of opening it in starting hand.<br />- During the combo, we summon Power Tool Dragon twice to add two specific cards: The first is D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation and the second is Telekinetic Charging Cell. That's why, we run three copies of each card to get them 100%.&nbsp;<br />- You have 3 cards in this deck you need to send to the GY: Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite, Summoner Monk and Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade. You can discard both the monsters when using Reincarnation and Phoenix Blade can be simply equiped to 1 monster before linking Isolde.<br />- If you open Cyber-Stein, Blackwing - Steam the Cloak and/or World Legacy - ""World Key"", don't worry since you can put them back into the deck using Saryuja Skull Dread.<br />- When you summon The Last Warrior from Another Planet, you need to negate its effect with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and then during the SAME CHAIN, activate Dusktopia's effect targeting The Last Warrior to protect it from Destruction.</p><p>For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on YouTube for more info.</p><p>Scroll down for the full combo. Enjoy. Peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You run 1 Swamp King just so that you can still go even if kitkallos gets banished. Then if that isn't enough you run 1 nemese to return the ishizu shufflers to deck or to return Kitkallos. You can also run nemese flag and it can be better in some instances but i choose to run umbrella so to it being an aqua water so you can use it for Fusions.</span>"
