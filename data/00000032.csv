Until then, I hope you're prepared to search an incredible amount, take advantage of the summon limit, and control the battlefield with pressure that makes control decks jealous of the hand advantage you can amass (although they've probably got us beat here when it comes to Traps and such-...) anyway here's the rundown of the new Dark Magician line-up!<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Snowball</strong>: You rack up advantage pretty quickly once you get going with this strategy. Between all of the layers of protection and nuance regarding the disruption lines on top of all of the means of searching from over a decade's worth of support? It's honestly difficult not to win after taking the lead.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Comeback Potential</strong>: Just having Illusion, Rod, Controlling the Dark Magician, or even just having Soul Servant in the GY during mid-to-late game will keep you in the game regardless of how things are going. Just don't play too zealously into something like a Trickstar Candina!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Rewarding Ceiling</strong>: While a lot of the early lines are pretty straightforward, most of the complexities with the archetype as a whole come from the usage of cards in tandem with one another. As opposed to early TCG builds where you kind of just drew cards and hoped it was enough to combo or amass a handtrap/backrow advantage, in Trinity, you'll be much more rewarded for your mastery of the cards at your disposal and how to best navigate the board you're dealt with or expecting. At times the pressure can be nigh suffocating from this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Possible to Brick</strong>: Unlike its TCG counterpart, due to the nature of the format, DM can't exactly take advantage of so much deck-thinning and draw power and while some cards like the Spellbook engine would help with the cycling process a bit, they will always be setting you a turn behind and adding more additional cards to cycle through in the long run. A brick doesn't necessarily equate to your searchers and passing, it's more of the unplayable circumstances of drawing... all of the Dark Magicians and having no way of summoning them. Hence why we've got some backrow to fall back on and ways to cheat him out in the event of a crisis.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong>: This particular list makes great use of Dark Magician Girl and cards concerning her (without playing the Magician Girl archetype of course) and as amazing as the cards surrounding her are, she herself is terrible to use. You'll be wanting to bin her whenever possible or simply control her when under gamestates like Magician's Combination. There's even a cheeky setup concerning Brain Controll (or Big Eye) and using her as Xyz material to go into Dhampir Sheridan. All of those applications aside, she (and her Signature Spell) aren't that great and don't feel that great to have until necessary for certain combos.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stat-Checked</strong>: If faced with too many monsters that are 3000 ATK/DEF or above you might run into a brick wall sometimes. You can tech in the Honests to get around this a bit better, but you'll need to hard draw those. Mahad can clear all things that are DARK and Apprentice can help the respective targets clear certain thresholds but most of the time those will be one use situations. Fortunately you can use Soul Servant to stack them from the GY to the top of deck for one final use.</li></ul><p>With introductions over, let's get into the setups you'll want to seek seek more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />Thanks to all of the years of support this archetype has received it has gained a number of searchers and retroactive searchers to help boost its consistency and lines of play to be very reliable which is a massive boon when it comes to limited formats like this one. Generally, any starter will net you the same gamestate no matter what goes down; however, there are some combinations of 2 or more cards that do require a bit more setup.</p><ul><li><strong>Manju &amp; Senju: </strong>Opening one of these cards enables you to grab Illusion of Chaos (or Sauravis if you already have it) then search Magicians' Souls. Using Souls you'll want to setup your GY with either Mana to protect your plays going down the line or DM/DMG to establish them early and get them in rotation for the later stages of the game. Then you'll pivot into either Dharc or Lyna. With Dharc you can grab <strong>Magikuriboh </strong>and use it during that same battle phase (or main phase later) to summon a Dark M agician immediately, <strong>Witch of the Black Forest</strong> if you have particularly greedy setup lines to go for in future turns with fusion plays or revival, or simply <strong>Magician's Rod</strong> who is the best starter in the deck when combined with other cards in the strategy and it's not even close! As for Lyna, <strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</strong> will be our primary find; however, <strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> isn't particularly bad either. The reason why is below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Diviner of the Herald:</strong> Using its effect to send, we'll pitch Arc Light from our Extra Deck to make it a Level 6 tuner, then we'll use Arc Light to grab Illusion of Chaos from the deck. Using Illusion, we'll pick up Magicians' Souls and send the appropriate targets like within the Manju &amp; Senju lines to the GY to summon it directly from the hand. Then we'll Synchro Summon itno <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. This card being a Level 7 who revives itself and answers the board during the SP is very handy for Rank 7 lines and getting rid of pesky monsters. It's worth noting that her banish effect to bring herself back does come up in this deck so don't use it willy-nilly. Banishing Souls is fine, but everything else in this list definitely is not. Use it within moderation as her effect can be used even on turns where she wasn't sent to the GY since it checks during each of their End Phase's. If you happen to need Rod and have a usable S/T at your disposal, you can summon her back, then use that S/T to tribute her and add back the Magician's Rod at EP to start your turn with your primary searcher. Very handy indeed.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Rod:</strong> This card probably has the highest ceiling regarding its uses since now, with Illusion of Chaos, it can search the entire archetype and its support including adding Dark Magician to the hand when necessary. You may also want to (if on the second turn or later) Link it off into Clara &amp; Rushka so that during the opponent's turn, when you activate an S/T, you can tribute the link to add Rod back to hand. One line I like to particularly setup involves using it as fusion material for <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> by grabbing <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>, that way in the event that the Fusion would be destroyed and I have a S/T I can use, I'd usually tribute away the Dark Magician girl to recycle Rod for next turn. You can also go for some pretty devastating Bond Between Teacher and Student setups when going second (or later in the game) to nuke your opponent's S/Ts or Monsters. It was this particular line of play that actually winded up getting <strong>Dark Burning</strong> <strong>Magic </strong>banned here. Oops.</li></ul><p>The majority of the time you'll want to stick to opening with one of these cards but if you happen to find yourself opening things like just DM or ways to him, it's still fine to cycle your respective S/Ts and support him as necessary. He's still the star of the deck and it's important to make sure you keep up your advantage until you can snowball the game out of controll.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where most games can end for you since the deck can swarm pretty decently after being setup or be rather controlling between Aruru and Mana being a devastating duo.</p><ul><li><strong>Bystial Baldrake: </strong>This card challenges most strategies with just its D.D. Crow effect; however, also being able to bin Dark Magicians, Rods, or resolved Manju/Senjus comes in handy for its tribute cost while still representing a lot of pressure. Additionally, it's a Dragon for a potential Fusion play into Dragon Knights and <em>finally</em>, it is a Level 6 that can be used to make Sheridan or Wollow to completely turn the game on its head proactively rather than reactively. If you can only banish out of your GY, then Servant, Mahad, and the Ritual Package should be fine banishes without any notable lasting consequences. You lose 1 draw for banishing out Palladiums but that's a sacrifice you have to make sometimes.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Eternal Soul: </strong>Don't flip this card too early without insurance, it immediately puts a target on itself and players usually try to remove it when its face-up every time. That said, it can revive DMs for free and search out your one-sided Heavy Storm whenever you want. Use it to secure a lead or establish one. The safest setup to use it under midgame is definitely when controlling <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> fusion monster, since if Eternal Soul leaves, the fusion would be destroyed but still float into the master and student, ultimately not setting you too far behind.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Soul Servant: </strong>This card's GY effect is rather potent and is virtually unrivaled when it comes to Unlimited power cards in Trinity Format. You'll usually be resolving it to draw two; however, with this build it's possible to draw up to four cards naturally from this effect- and we play TWO copies. The most important things to note about the stacking (and not searching) effect is that you can use it during the EP of your opponent's turn to rig your next draw and <em>the fact that this card can stack cards from your GY to the top of the deck</em> which is very, very potent in a limited format. Don't forget this as it might save you when piloting the deck!</li></ul><p>Should the game not end at this point and you find yourself in a complex, mind-boggling gamestate then you're probably going to want one of the following closers.</p><p><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight &amp; Eternal Soul: </strong>This combination is really rough to deal with, especially since S/T removal is very limited in Trinity, so if this is established you have virtually won. DMtDK is treated as DM so it can be revived by Eternal Soul and is constantly under its protection, additionally, Eternal Soul is protected by DMtDK's continuous effect, making this a really rough situation to navigate for the opponent in most cases. Additionally, since DMtDK is treated as DM, it works with the field spell <strong>Magician's Salvation</strong> and <strong>Magician's Combination</strong> so even something like a DMG can represent DMtDK coming back over and over while protecting said cards in the process. This card is a monster and needs to be respected when properly established.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Combination: </strong>Probably the most underrated support card this deck has at its disposal. You tag out your DM/DMG to their counterpart and negate any card or effect (just not the activation so no Damage Step shenanigans). Once the opponent has had enough and decides to blow up Combination, it even has a revenge effect to clear a card on their side of the field. You can also force this effect yourself with <strong>Timaeus the United</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Magicians' Souls </strong>turning those plays into removal.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Signature Move: </strong>Though these cards are often considered bad and I even think so most of the time myself, I cannot understate how potent their effects are when they resolve. In all of my history playtesting this deck in any iteration, the games in which the Signature Attacks of the duo have resolved have always resulted in my win. Whether that be the easily accessed <strong>Dark Magic Attack </strong>or the trickier to pull off <strong>Dark Burning Attack</strong> (though you can access it easier with Bond), the signature moves can really just blow away opponents regardless of their deck type and cut the game shorter than what they might have been expecting.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />Since the lines from the archetype itself are rather consistent, the deck can be easy to get started with, but might take a bit to get used to and master; however, it's usability allows a great deal of customizability to cater to most tech choices like Dragonmaids or the legal Bystials to establish DMtDK easier or SPYRAL to do Master Plan setups with Magicians' Souls. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>The Eye of Timaeus, Chaos Creator, Kashtira Monsters &amp; Birth, Magician of Dark Illusion, the remaining Bystials, Protecting Spirit Loagaeth, Noctovision Dragon, Mana Dragon Zimitron, Magician of Chaos, &amp; Chaos Form, Chicken Game, Destined Rivals, and Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous<br /></em><br />As always, if you've made it this far, thanks for checking this write-up out and combing over my iteration of the Dark Magician Starter. Once Chronicle Sorceress arrives you can rest assured that I'll be updating things with fresh lines and even more explosive combos since she increases the deck's consistency by a considerable margin. Until then, we'll just have to keep up a steady pace and recite the incantations of the ulimate wizard in terms of attack and defense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Of course, it's weak compared to the OCG 60 card version because we don't have Block Dragon or Grass for instance but we can still do some cool things like setting up a Savage Borreload Dragon and a Gallant Granite without a normal summon. Also, I once again included an Hop Ear Squadron (that we can search thanks to Cupid Pitch) to have more options + win in time. It is NOT a definitive deck list and it will definitely change when the next banlist is revealed around CYAC's release so please don't take for granted everything you see in here because we will have to adapt.</p>"

The Elemental HEROs and Neo-Spacians team up to bring justice.,"<p>This one's been another strategy that's been on the back burner of pet decks to boost to a somewhat competitive level while still maintaining its identity and not just falling prey to jamming in as many engines and broken backrow as possible to make it competitively viable. While this list isn't as refined as my World Chalice or Monarch builds of the past, it's been a blast to use and represents a ton of interesting gamestates with and without the use of Spirit of Neos who will potentially be retiring after this brief collaboration. Regardless, the core remains so I may as well document this while I have the opportunity, yeah?<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>OTK Potential</strong>: Fusion decks inherently have the advantage of being able to cheat the summon limit and jump straight into powerful boss monsters. Due to HEROs being pretty consistent with the over a decade worth of a support they have combined with all of the juicy warrior support cards means that the potential to just OTK from unexpected thresholds is real. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as high of a consistent threshold like Fluffal can be, but the potential can be theoretically higher depending on the hand.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Reversal Potential</strong>: Shining Neos Wingman, Absolute Zero, Acid, Favorite Contact, and Miracle Fusion produce ridiculous levels of threat leaning closely to the presence that Vision HERO Trinity used to, without the need to cram three monsters into one.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Sky is the Limit</strong>: The starters can be pretty easy, but with the Neos and Neo-Spacian cards included, a lot of the lines can get pretty complicated. That aside, mastery of the list rewards creative synergies and ways of getting around pesky material restrictions for the extra deck lineup.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Minimal Disruption</strong>: This isn't HERO Beat, so we won't be naturally expecting to jam a guy, set five, and pass (though you can still play Hero Blast recycling Neos for a pretty hilarious payoff). We mostly aim to play through established boards and end the game fast. The less the better, but for some lines, like <strong>Brave Neos</strong>, it's better that your opponent at least control something. Most of the interaction we'll have are just ways to tag out our monsters, protect them, and remove backrow.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Neo Space</strong>: Despite Grand Mole and Aqua Dolphin having decent enough effects that can and should come up, they are objectively some of the worst cards in the deck and the deck does suffer for it. They are played as Aqua Dolphin is Unbound thanks to Marine always being treated as Dolphin and it being a WATER Warrior enables it to be a target for RotA and material for Absolute Zero. Grand Mole's just a pesky boy. Dark Panther's played for Nebula since its effect is incredible when it resolves but it is definitely able to be cut. We just need to have some space for Spacians for <strong>EN -&nbsp; Engage Neo Space</strong>. They also let us use Convert Contact... I guess?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Limited Xtra Options</strong>: The Extra Deck isn't too tight with cards like Nova Master and Grandmerge being expendable as an example; however, not too many adjustments can be made to make more room for Links (to use Neo-Spacians for) or more versatile Xyzs. This is mostly just a result of trying to maintain the core identity of the archetype rather than have most games just be decided by something like Claivesolish OTK.</li></ul><hr /><p><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />The hands can be pretty complicated to unravel, so I'll only really be breaking down some of the most relevant starters. It's worth noting that the fate of Spirit of Neos in a future banlist might change a lot of these lines, so heed caution.</p><ul><li><strong>The Classic: </strong>Having a way to turn HEROs into Sunrise and pick up Miracle is great and Sunrise while expressing a decent pop effect isn't all that important when it comes to modern Trinity standards. It is mostly just our way of resolving effects like Shadow Mist and Liquid without banishing them prior or having to waste Absolute Zero like one would in the past.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Engage... not that one:</strong> Engage Neo Space is a pretty interesting card that offers you the ability to send Shadow Mist directly to GY as cost or bin an early Aqua Dolphin for Miracle Fusion setups and immediately beam out either Spirit of Neos or the OG Vanilla. The target only really matters for maintaining minimum summons for a play; however, if you go into Spirit of Neos, you can resolve the effect for Favorite or Instant Contact then tag out into OG Vanilla Neos to use as a material for something like Brave Neos on an attacking turn. Couple that with Stratos or Mist being able to search back the shuffled Spirit as a ""defensive"" search during the opponent's turn makes Engage a fairly potent card. Just gotta have the respective card in hand to activate it.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Spirit:</strong> Outside of the aforementioned lines, if you can just access this card through something like Stratos, Mist, or E Call can have a way of summoning it prior to resolving stuff like Engage, you can seriously snowball your advantage and broaden the scope of your searches. On the opponent's turn, you'll be wanting to pick up Instant Contact most of the time; however, Favorite Contact's a safer line, albeit slower. Using Instant Contact, we can cheat out all of our potent, searcher Fusions or if we already have access to a fusion method like Polymerization, then we can summon Flame Wingman (or reveal it for Over Fusion) to fusion summon <strong>Shining Neos Wingman</strong>. Yes, all of this is from Spirit of Neos... as an opener. Fast right?</li></ul><p>You'll want to assess your removal and interaction by estimating how many turns it should take you to conclude the duel. Since we aren't on a lot of recursion or that amazing <strong>Legacy of a Hero</strong> card, we can't go too late game. Most plays are one-and-done, so make them count!</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />If you're struggling to break even, you can use the following lines to tip the game into your favor.</p><ul><li><strong>Fallen Mist: </strong>If Shadow Mist was sent to the GY in a prior turn, pick up Liquid Soldier, and use him to resurrect Mist and grab Mask Change. This gives you the ability to threaten Acid for Fast Effect Harpie's Feather Duster that also lowers ATK or pivot into Xtra HERO Wonder Driver and use Mist to grab Spirit of Neos. If the opponent attacks, you can summon Spirit at Link Point under Wonder Driver and recycle a fusion method. If they simply just pop Wonder Driver instead, you can still use the float effect to summon Neos anyway just in case they plan to play it safe and have you summon Spirit. The option of a Rank 4's also always on the table when it comes to Liquid Mist, but a comfortable line is simply using Liquid to resummon Stratos. Judge the gamestate and decide if you can use the Spell/Trap destruction effect, a search isn't always needed to close out games in Trinity.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Pretty Good</strong><strong>:</strong> Liquid and Cross Keeper cycling comes up a lot. Not just for ways to close out the game easier, but also for the limited Traps we're on in this build. Almost all of them stand to end the game way faster than your opponent might expect and you showing off flashy combos from yours truly will have them respecting your backrow less and less, especially if you set Polymerization as a bluff.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Brave Neos: </strong>Use this the same way you would <strong>Spirit of Neos</strong>, but proactively through its destruction by battle, as opposed to reactively when being attacked. This card usually forces interaction on it, so be ready to trade resources. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Omni HERO: </strong>Absolute Zero, The Shining, and Nova Master are our HEROs for the job in this build. Nova Master's great in simplified gamestates, Absolute Zero's the most notable in most gamestates, and The Shining's great for looping things either banished by the opponent or by you for a Miracle Fusion (including its materials).<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Core Convergence:</strong> While <strong>Elemental HERO Core</strong> might seem like a weird choice and one you won't be summoning a lot, it makes a great late game Miracle Fusion target as it can be used to resummon <em>any </em>HERO Fusion previously used in the duel. This is great for Brave Neos but particularly for Sunrise as Sunrise triggers on any Special Summon, not just proper Fusion Summon.</li></ul><p>The games shouldn't go too long; however, in the event that does happen these are some decent options for closing things out immediately.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shining Neos Wingman: </strong>A protected card that pops things on summon and gains scaling attack based on the cards in your GY <em>and</em> burns the opponent after a battle concludes? This thing goes absolutely wild and is an incredible ender accessed through Over Fusion and Instant Contact. Polymerization's the risky way to getting to it and I recommend holding at least one Miracle Fusion for making this as a finale since you'll be able to do it as the first summon and still have room for more after the way's been cleared.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Grandmerge: </strong>Using two Neos', you can use the battle tag to go into quite literally any Fusion in the Extra Deck. If you don't see an easy line to game, I recommend tagging out into <strong>Nebula Neos</strong> and drawing a ridiculous amount of cards. You can then choose to negate itself (and still get the draw) so it doesn't return to the Extra at End Phase, or negate something else. For this same reason, <strong>Contrast HERO Chaos </strong>can be a great option since it's always treated as an Elemental HERO.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>HENSHIN!: </strong>The Mask Change options in this list aren't as snowbally as something like Anki; however, they are still rather potent. Turning your LIGHT beatsticks into Koga and using Koga to steal games is a great option that can go under most people's radar as you don't really represent any Mask Changes in this deck.</li></ul><hr /><p><br />It's not expected that the Spirit of Neos lines will last forever, but after testing without the card and just opting for a second copy of Brave Neos or Engage, it'll ultimately be fine, just not the explosive threat that it currently is. Regardless, due to the number of lines offered through Engage, Stratos, Mist, and Spirit of Neos alike, the following are great considerations for shaking up the deck:<br /><br /><em>Predaplants &amp; Chaos Monsters, Super Polymerization, Dark Magician &amp; Dark Cavalry, Rank 7s like Big Eye to summon through Spirit of Neos and Instant Contact, Infernoble Knights &amp; Burstinatrix, Fallen of Albaz, Skyscraper II - Hero City (trust me). <br /><br /></em>Thanks for reading this far if you have. The viability of this deck likely won't last in the same condition it currently exists in, but with Honest Neos, Neos Fusion, DPE, and Vyon being out of the picture, I imagine there is likely more to be expected when it comes to hitting this archetype once Maze of Memes rolls in and we get Wake Up. For the time being though, I'll continue to just play and build whatever I want, since that's what's fun about Trinity for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Flare Wingman - Infernal Rage and Shining Neos Wingman","<p>As the name implies, this deck is a shout-out to Chainsaw Man. No more spoilers, but Denji's friend Pochita is not only the Chainsaw Devil, but is also called the ""Hero of Hell."" I understand that it would have been more thematically appropriate to use Elemental HERO Wildedge, but it's honestly mid. Sure, it can attack all monsters the opponent controls once each, but if its ATK was 3000, this effect would be better. In addition to that, Wildedge doesn't deal piercing damage, nor does it have effects that increase or descrease ATK/DEF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, this deck can go second due to having 6 hand traps and 3 Forbidden Droplets. As for Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage, it's good going first or second, since if can search Favorite Contact, and tribute itself to summon Elemental HERO Sunrise if Neos was used as Fusion Material. If you go first, you can use this combo to search Favorite Contact and disrupt the opponent's board with Shining Neos Wiseman.

Dinosaur King is your destiny, yeah!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Childhood nostalgia aside, I'm glad Konami tried to revitalize Dinosaurs with the Transcendrake archetype. Not only does Ground Xeno let you search a normal Dino or a Dino tuner, but it also pops a card in your hand and lets you do a Fusion Summon. Plus, the archetype incentivizes you to play Level 4 and 6 Dinosaur Normal monsters that you might like. Gigantozowler, Drillgnathus, and Glaciasaurus are all references to 3 of those monsters that I mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So not only does Transcendrake give Dinos a leg up, but it also gives you a reason to take Megalosmasher X or Kabazauls out of your binder. This deck has 8 hand traps, a Called By The Grave, and Pot of Prosperity, so it can do fine going first or second. As for this deck's name, ""Kyoryu"" is the Japanese word for ""Dinosaur"", and ""<span>ō"" being the Japanese word for ""King.""&nbsp;</span></p>"

Gryphon Rider helps out vs. cards that would end your turn mid-combo like Nibiru. Another good bait is first using Kashtira Fenrir, since it searches for Kashtira Scareclaw, an excellent extender for the archetype. Fenrir's search isn't needed for the combo making it perfect bait for an Imperm, Ash, etc.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Scareclaw primarily functions as a turn 3 OTK deck just like Salamangreat and Tri-Brigade - Set up interruptions and board presence on the first turn, disrupt your opponent as much as possible on turn 2, then on turn 3 you OTK as you clear their board and attack for game with Tri-Heart and Accesscode.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you're going second, (depending on your hand and current gamestate) you can either immediately go for the kill or build your board after you clear your opponent's. This deck has a myriad of ways to clear boards such as Rite of Aramesir (bounce with Dracoback), Nadir Servant (pop with by sending N'Tss), Primal Planet Reichphobia (pop with 3 DEF position monsters). Monsters such as Tri-Heart, Accesscode, Fenrir and Lava Golem (searchable with Small World!) also clear boards of problematic cards.&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><br /><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal"">The best baits for interruption before you start your main Scareclaw combo are the Adventure cards and Kashtira Fenrir. It forces your opponent to use their Ash or negate on board, allowing you to fully combo off!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck easily second and either OTK or establish a board. When going second, think whether you can go for lethal or equalize the board state enough where you're ahead in resources so you can finish off your opponent for the next turn.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">When siding out cards, the best cards to exhange are 1 copy of each Scareclaw, Dogmatika Punishment and Scareclaw Twinsaw. </li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck can also use Super Polymerization reliably to clear boards, especially with Garura. (I just didn't use it for this deck build since the meta right now are Kashtira and Labyrinth, which are fairly immune to Super Poly).</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Another card this deck can use for extra consistency is Pot of Prosperity, since the only Extra Deck monsters you truly need are Light-Heart and Tri-Heart.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">If you're going first, and you think your opponent is going to board wipe you, don't commit all your resources in your hand to the board. Just have enough board presence were you can survive until next turn and swing back the game in your favour.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Board breakers like Lava Golem and Kurikara are very searchable with Small World. Both are very situational, and they can reliably out an established board so you can do your plays.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Extreme consistency means more staple cards and supplimentary engines like Dogmatika can be stuffed into this already strong deck. Synergy with the Adventure Engine means that Scareclaw can reliably play through the all-too-common and devastating Nibiru, a card that destroys almost every strategy in today's meta!</p><p>With all the support Scareclaw has received the past couple main sets and how the recent banlists worked out, they now have reached critical mass to competitively viability. The question is, does Scareclaw earn itself a worthwhile spot among its stronger Visas Starfrost lore siblings - Tearlaments, Kashtira and Manadome? Only time will tell. Time to pilot the deck to find out!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It was one of my first two decks I went for on MD with Eldlich, because I also love zombies.&nbsp; They were strong enough in season 1 to get me to gold but that is where Eldlich had to take over.&nbsp; With Rikka support, this deck can evolve into a field clearing XYZ powerhouse.</p><p>I run 2 Rikka Petal and 3 Lonefire Blossom for consistency.&nbsp; Once both Petals are in the GY, you can only use one per turn, so if you want to remove one, you can, but between these 5 cards, it makes for a very easy time getting your first petal on the field/GY to go into Snowdrop The Rikka Fairy.&nbsp; A lot of this deck revolves around Snowdrop.&nbsp; Snowdrop will allow you to mimic a cards level and change all cards on your field to that level.</p><p>Foolish Burial is amazing here.&nbsp; It is an extra way to get Petal into the GY if you don't draw Petal, Lonfire, or Snowdrop.&nbsp; If you don't need to get to Petal, it can be used to mill out Spore, Carrotweight, or Rose Lover.&nbsp; Carrotweight is best milled when you already have Spore or Rose in hand.&nbsp; This lets you get a free level 4 on the field and gives you a resource in the GY to summon from hand or set up for XYZ summon with Spore.&nbsp; Carrotweight can be brought down to a single copy in favor of Ash, Fengli, or Called by the Grave.</p><p>Sekka's Light x2 is something I am still playing with, but it is a strong card and not very punishing if you need to use it.&nbsp; Between the two copies, you can draw 4 cards and re draw 2.&nbsp; Try to save them for after you have used Foolish and Miracle Fertilizer if you can, but this is not necessary if you need the draw 2.&nbsp; These can also be swapped for Called by Grave, Miracle, or Ash.</p><p>Miracle is really strong with XYZ as well.&nbsp; It beats out Monster Reborn because it can special summon across multiple turns.&nbsp; It consumes your normal summon, but this isn't an issue.&nbsp; It's true power comes from summoning XYZ material.&nbsp; It reads, ""If a monster Special Summoned by this effect leaves the field, destroy this card;"" however, if you use that special summoned monster as XYZ material, it never left the field and it is no longer special summoned by Miracle, so detaching to GY does not destroy it.</p><p>Rose Archer is a bit of more fluid in this deck, but I run it because it works really well with plants and it is a very budget card.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can run Ash, Effect Veiler, Maxx ""C"", Ogre, or Imperm.&nbsp; Archer is also a great hand trap to combat the Imperms.</p><p>Evil Thorn could be worked out for something else, but it makes an easy way to summon Princessprite.&nbsp; Turn one with Petal can search Snowdrop, tribute Petal, summon Snowdrop and Thorn, then activate Thorn and summon the other two from the deck.&nbsp; Use Snowdrop to set their levels to 8 and summon Teardrop the Rikka Queen off of the Thorns leaving Snowdrop in def.</p><p>Using the first part of Snowdrop locks you into plant special summons, but if it survives, next turn you can set another monster to 8 and XYZ Number 97 and XYZ 97 into Number 92 if needed.&nbsp; Otherwise Number 107 and Hieratic are strong non-plant options.&nbsp; Just remember that if there are no plants on the field, Rose Archer is useless.</p><p>Dark Armed, The Dragon of Annihilation is currently in the deck, but it doesn't see much play and could be swapped for something else.&nbsp; It is a little tricky to get out as it requires at least 1 Dark XYZ to be in GY and then Snowdrop another dark monster to level 5+, but it creates a strong 1 cost XYZ.&nbsp; Alternatively, Number 87 is a strong base attack with ok effects option but has a high cost of 3 level 8 monsters.&nbsp; There is also Sacred Tree Beast which has a strong effect, but cost 2 level 9 monsters.&nbsp; This requires to Spore off one of the 4 level 8's in the deck and isn't the easiest summon, but sets up a great negate and has easy material generation.</p><p>Other Side Deck options are there as some decent swaps to the more flexible cards in the deck.&nbsp; If you want to run 3 Ash, I would personally take out 1 Cherubsprout, Carrotweight, and either a Gaurdioak or Miracle.&nbsp; Play around and let me know what you think!</p>"

With Cyberstein added, I can also add a layer of negation with Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon, or commit some foolery with Depsia Proskenion or Invoked Purgatrio (if I main deck Book of Eclipse).

Getting Haine out also protects all of these except Mechaba from being target by effects, and the Dogmatika engine leaves you with Fleurdelis in hand for an extra hand trap. Since most of your monsters are spellcasters, Vice-Madame is proccing off of them to add more resources to hand or special summon an extra monster to field.

A lot has changed since last time.</p><p>Handtrap line up consists of Nibiru, purely because it's one of the best handtraps to deal with Kashtira provided they don't run Iblee/Crossout/Adventurer. And still has utility against anything Bystial/Dragon Link related. Ash Blossom is also a must i feel. Being able to deal with cards such as Branded Fusion is absolutely key, and Impermenence because of it sheer utility.&nbsp;</p><p>The Striker engine itself doesn't really need to be explained too much, as pretty much everybody who has played in the last few years is more than aware of what it can do. Linkage is an awesome addition to the deck allowing you to kill off your opponent a lot faster making the deck less reliant on the Accesscode Talker package to close out games. Pot Of Prosperity, Avarice, ROTA and Terraforming allow the deck to grab what it needs and wants, and in Avarice's case recycle the ED monsters in case the game becomes grindy and also to alleviate the loss of ED monsters with Prosperity's effect. Harpie's, Evenly, Thrust and Talents aid the deck in being able to break boards. My tech card of choice is none other than Herald Of The Abyss. This card is actually really good in a format. Being able to out things like Shangri-Ira/Arise Heart, while circumventing the effects of Forbidden Lance and inbuilt destruction protection is a real premium. It also is very good at being able to out untargetable/unkillable/unaffected by card effects boss monsters that are typically the bane of Striker's existence as Herald affects the player, not the card. This is vital for the Labrynth matchup in particular to deal with Lady Labrynth, as that cannot be targeted or destroyed whilst there are set traps on the field.&nbsp; Other monsters such as Avramax,/Arrival Cyberse/Mirrorjade/Dragoon also fall to Herald as well, making it incredibly versatile in rogue matchups or for Jade/Dragoon in Branded.</p><p>The side deck consists of Lava Golem, as the deck has enough methods now to get to your ED monsters with Linkage, Area Zero, Drones so as to not need to heavily rely on your normal summon as much. I'm currently testing out both Lancea and Droll, so they could interchange. Cosmic Cyclone because Anti-Spell Fragrance has seen an uptake in the side deck due to the Kashtira spells often being critical for them to make the plays they require, and I don't feel like using Twisters due to the discard cost. Solemn to say no to anything that hits my backrow, D-Barrier for the meta decks and the final copy of Evenly to round it off nicely.</p>"

Burning Abyss has been competitive in the past, but I wanted to make a casual deck that uses all the B.A. cards with no full sets and staple cards outside the strategy.</p><p>My rules are to make sure to include as many archtype cards as possible. Avoid full playsets so decks are not super consistent. Include a few staples (Ash, Maxx, etc) for interaction. Possibly include another archtype (or their staples) if they have synergy. &nbsp;</p><p>Any suggestions to make this deck more fun and at a similar power level with modern structures decks would be appreciated.</p>"

Not the craziest or most well constructed deck or whatever but I think it's fun! Many discard to draw cards to get your monsters in the GY so you can start summoning your Necrofears! Venom dragons are used also to get more monsters in the GY just like Wee Witch's Apprentice and generally I just simply found them to be super useful monsters to have on the field. Your Necrofears have plenty of card removal on their own and Curse Necrofear's removal gets better with more Destiny Board Letters on the field! I would appreciate some advice or critique on this deck! All comments are appreciated and I thank you for the time you spent checking this deck out!</p>

Have i got the deck for you.<br /><br />P.u.n.k Pride is a deck that squarely fits into the T1.5 metaspace. It's concistent and powerful, with only 1 or 2 carsd missing from making the deck Tier 1. It has an extremely favorable mashup against both Labirynth and Kashtira, and has mechanics that are very hard to play around for nearly every deck. P.u.n.k. Pride is skillful and is not just a 1 card pony trick that can easily be thwarted by negates. It's the perfect deck for those that want a differnt choice this 02/2023 TCG Format.<br /><br />This deck list is ""Loosely"" based off of a list made by MBT for one of his Ten Minute Testing videos. However, for this build i did make some changes, as i did not like some of the card choices when doing playtesting:<br /><br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Dangerous Gabu: When running the deck, i found myself never really wanting to draw this card or use it.<br />- Joruri P.U.N.K - Madame Spider: Since we are running no P.U.N.K Traps, we have no need to run this card.</p><p>- Psy-Frame Negate Package (x3 Psy-Frame Gear Beta + x1 Psy-Frame Driver): Drive is such a bad garnet, and i found that ash blossom worked much better here.

I know certian builds are running 2-3 copies as E-tele targets but they tend to brick as trhe deck does not need more tuners. This in future may just become another ash blossom.<br /><br />In the extra, i cut nearly all of the Link Monsters, keeping only Gold Pride Star Nytro Head. When playtesting, i never went into any of the Links, and i rarely ever go into Star Nytro head. Star Nytro Head does have purpose for being fodder for Carrie's ability, and making Star Leon bigger, but depending on whether new support comes out in may, this card may or may not stay in the deck.<br /><br />I also removed some of the Synchros, and swapped them out for either more copies of&nbsp; key pieces (+ x1 <a class=""type-synchro-monster"" href=""/card/?search=60465049"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/60465049.jpg"" data-card=""60465049"" data-name=""Psychic End Punisher"">Psychic End Punisher</span></a> ) to help combat against Kashtira, or swapped out for cards that provided some more utiliity:</p><p>+ x1 Crystron Phoenix as an out against Labrynth Decks. Summon this to blank their backrow and graveyard, assuming they have no already activated Skill Drain. This is an effect that could see increased value if the new 1 card Super Heavy Samurai combo takes off in the TCG like it has in the OCG.this also marginally good against other decks, but is not the main goto.</p><p>+ x1 Stellar WInd Wolfrayet as an out against Kashtira. This is not super easy to go into, but non-targeting shuffle into deck is extremely poweful and very few if any decks can actually play around it. The effect is very easy to pull off as most decks need to activate 4-5 effects minimum to get into anything meaningful. And P.u.n.k. Pride can easily take the game on the crackback.<br /><br />+ x1 Hyper Psychic Riser...

This in essence could be any level 6 synchro, but this one does have some annoying properties that can make it hard for cards to go off, and is one of those cards that hurts your opponents more than it hurts you. Also, this can be an intermediary to level 9 synchros if needed. Technically,. if your store/group allowed it, you could run the Japanese Copy from Duel Disk Yusei, which on Ebay is ~$20 USD, bu your deck would not be tournament legal.<br /><br />The sideboard is subjective, and was largely just based off of the existing board list MBT made.

Getting two Recital Starlings out will get you two more Lyrilusc, and when you finish with both of them, you can use them both to go into Utopic Future and Utopic Draco Future; Assembled Nightingale can deal damage and protect your other Lyrilusc from destruction/effects; Ensemblue Robin can floodgate a few Special Summons; Promenade Thrush can take care of Traps/Spells as well as provide a boost to Attack when you want to push for game. Tri-Brigade just helps cycle through your deck and can act as backup if your board gets wiped by using their ability to go into their Link monsters. If you want to win more, send one of your XYZs into Zeus during Main 2 to ensure your opponent's board gets wiped. Evil Thorn just gives you a free Rank 1 XYZ if its ability goes through in exchange for your Normal Summon, although possibly without the protection that using your Lyrilusc cards give.</p><p>For Side Deck, you've got your hand traps and other removal if you want to counterpick based on what your opponent is using. Also using a high-attack Kaiju rather than Gameciel, since you can crash Recital Starling into it for very high damage.</p><p>If you're going first, an optimal end board is Utopic Draco Future, Assembled Nightingale, and Ensemble Robin. Utopic Draco can block a monster effect and Robin floodgates a minimum of two Special Summons, while Nightingale will protect itself and Robin from destruction with one material used. If going second, depending on your opponent's board setup, you have the potential to OTK. Get Assembled Nightingale on the board with as many materials as possible, and either Recital Starlings if you can safely crash for game-ending damage, Utopic Future to steal a resistant boss monster, or Utopic Draco Future to block monster effect.</p>"

Rogue or Stun, decks that can take on the meta need to be made in order to put a check in the game. However as we learned many times, Tier-0 decks can exist regardless of their weaknesses. Which is why today I rather ""exported"" an interesting Stun deck from the Eastern Hemisphere. The card ""Fary Tail - Luna"" is a card while on the field can return any monster (and itself) to the hand (unless it can't ve targeted). Then there is the Kaiju archetype: an archetype that can have one monster be tributed on your opponents side, and special summoned on your side. What synergy do they have? TL;DR give a Kaiju to your opponent, summon Luna, and return both of them to your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The twist with this however is that I am also running the Runick engine. I'm not gonna go into details about them, but the archetype has spells that have Kino effects in exchange for giving up your battle phase. Alongside a field spell that plays them from your hand anytime and recovers them from the GY to the deck, Runick has a lovely will spot in the Yu-Gi-Oh Stun Deck lore. How I combined all three of them is by using the Kaijus and ""Fairy Tail - Luna"" to destabilize your opponents board, and using the Runick spells to your best use and to mill resources from your opponents deck.</p>"

After taking this to locals and getting the advice of many experienced Runick players I ended on this list. You need to have 17-19 Runick Quick Play Spells in order to have consistent draws off of Runick Fountain. The main strategy is to switch between both Runick and Sky Striker cards to control the gamestate. The Runick cards should not only be used to control the game, but to summon Runick monsters from the extra deck to stop an opponents attack. You will be winning most of the time by decking out your opponent but you can also win by killing your opponent with Sky Striker monsters and especially BLS which most decks cannot out.&nbsp;</p>"

I think this might be the best positioning for the card, but even then it doesn't do a ton. Try to flip it quickly with Disturbance Strategy or Mind Wipe during your opponent's turn (NOT DURING THEIR DRAW STEP) and hopefully catch their Pot of Greeds and Graceful Charities. Once you have a couple appropriates on line you should be able to quickly draw out your entire deck and win with Exodia in hand.&nbsp;</p>"

The main goal here is to work the two parts together to create a board of heavy hitters that can overwhelm your opponent. Cards like Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment can help get your combos started, being able to get certain Gate Guardian pieces in play or into the graveyard, and fetching Branded Fusion or Branded in Red. The Gate Guardian monsters (Namely Gate Guardians Combined and Gate Guardian of Wind and Water) can help protect your monsters from various targeting and spell/trap effects, while Mirrorjade can deal with monsters by banishing them or destroying them if it leaves the field. Despian Quaeritis and Gate Guardian of Water and Thunder can reduce a monster's attack points to stop them from attacking your monsters as well as help trigger Labyrinth Wall Shadow's destruction ability. There is also the possibility of using Blazing Cartesia to go into Granguignol the Dusk Dragon which in turn can get you into one of Quaeritis or even Luluwalilith. Overall the deck works a lot better than I thought it would, but it is vulnerable to being interrupted, and if a board is broken, it's not the easiest to recover.</p>"

Usually if the opponent is able to get pass your P.U.N.K combo, Thunder Dragons' amazing recylability will net the win. Work in progress, the extra deck is iffy with Zombie Vampire (used to have more Thunder Dragons I could special if milled) and really not sure about psy-frame hand trap, unless you have enough material for Lambda, because it can basically be a brick. Admittedly, shotgun Maxx C or Ash into a free Chaos Ruler is very nice when the time comes. Also might switch Allure for Chicken Game, but the last couple of games have been spright outting my board and I only have ~5k life points after doing the PUNK combo so I'm unsure. Fun deck all the same, Thunder Dragons and PUNKs are definitely in my top 3 archetypes so I love to use them together.</p>"

The first is important once you have to use destruction Venus to recover your shineballs and the second is simply due to there being many combolines that potentially allow you to bait many handtraps or ressources and still get to a decent endboard.</li><li>With a decent hand you will generally have extra shineballs to make I:P Masquerena and the other Extras, while the minimum endboard is generally Masterflare, Elf and a synchro 10.&nbsp;</li><li>You will notice that the Countertrap search often has to be ditched inorder to get the extenders you need, but usually thats alright, if you can fill your hand with Orangelight or other handtraps.</li><li>Considering Runick is heavily played, I tend to go for Chengying instead of Baronne, if i can end on the Counter Trap or a Herald of the Arc Light to have <strong>at least </strong>1 omni negate.</li><li>The Ishizu cards are basically there to serve as 1. Link fodder if you can special summon them 2. Tribute fodder for Trias for the card draw 3. Filling the GY with Diviner, Majesty, Trias, Eva or Neptune 4. Reshuffling your own Shine Balls to keep extending 5. Get a peak at what the opponent is playing.</li><li>Once you have Neptune in Hand your mills become your second hand since you can special summon any Agent you milled.</li><li>Sadly the deck bricks every now and then, which is just natural if you play 3 Garnets and the mills can go wrong if you need them to hit well, but it just happens from time to time.</li><li>The interaction between Orange Light and Eva will many times give you the starter or extender you need.</li><li><strong>Handtraps:</strong> The deck <em>can</em> bait many Handtraps - especially with the Ishizu cards (many ash the millers and if they dont the mills can be useful) BUT it can die to an <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a>&nbsp;or <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59438930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59438930.jpg"" data-card=""59438930"" data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</span></a>&nbsp;if your hand doesn't have any follow up.

Basically, access to Isolde and a Level 5 Synchro is fully combo for the Deck and the plays are pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>2&nbsp;<strong>Super Quantum Red Layer</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Neo Space Connector</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong> to get to Isolde. 2<strong> Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong> which is a monster negate and it is very easy to Summon. You don't need to search it as you have pretty much enough interruption in your basic combo already, but it is another addition to your end-board if you do happen to draw it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for extension. 3 <strong>Infernoble Knight - Oliver</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ogier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Renaud</strong>. Renaud is great for extension, as a Summon off of Isolde, and he can grab back something like <strong>Living Fossil</strong> for more extension. Oliver is another extender and he can make himself into an equip which is important for this Deck. Ogier has more usage with the new Infernoble support, so having something that can foolish an equip or a FIRE Warrior is great with the new grave effects. Also, he can also make himself an equip which is important as we need at least 1 monster who can make themselves an equip in our starting combo. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ricciardetto</strong>. Drawing him is fine as he can basically make Isolde pretty easily depending on your starting hand if you do draw him, but he is also a pretty good Summon off of Isolde as well since he can reborn a FIRE Warrior on summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Turpin</strong> which is a free summon from hand or GY if you control an equip and he can also make himself an equip.</span></p><p><span>For Spells and Traps, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> to search our stuff. 3<strong> Infernoble Arms - Durendal</strong>, 2<strong> Infernoble Arms - Almace</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Arms - Joyeuse</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Infernoble Arms Museum</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade,&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Living Fossil</strong>. Durendal searches a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior. Almace can equip a different Infernoble Arms from Deck. Joyeuse can add back a FIRE Warrior from GY. Noble Arms Museum searches a Noble Arms card and specials a Noble Knight that is currently an equip.</span></p><p><span>ED: 1&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fluer</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Angelica, Princess of Noble Arms</strong>, 1 <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Charlemagne</strong>. Ricciardetto does Warrior lock you if you use his effect on Summon, and because you will be using that effect most of the time, you can't really play much outside of Warriors in your Extra Deck. If you aren't Warrior locked, you can make Masquerena with your extra bodies to go into Avramax or Unicorn. Angelica seraches Noble Arms Museum and if she is targeted, she can banish herself until the End Phase to foolish a FIRE Warrior from Deck and summon Captain Roland from your Extra Deck. You can target her with the effects of your Infernobles in GY that allows them to make themselves equips which then gets you to the rest of your combo. Charlemagne basically is another Charles after he equips Charles using his effect on Link Summon. Then, you can Summon your equipped Charles using Noble Arms Museum to have another body on field.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck can be whatever, but I would recommend board clearers and backrow removal for going second.</span></p><p><span>Full combo is simple: Make Isolde using whatever and dump Living Fossil to Summon out Ricciardetto. Ricciardetto revives a Level 4 non-Tuner FIRE Warrior which can be put into your GY through something like Ogier or Oliver. Synchro into Angelica and search Noble Arms Museum. Museum pay 1200 to add whatever Noble Arms you need or are missing. An Infernoble in GY targets Angelica to try to equip, and then chain Angelica to banish herself, dump Turpin, and Summon Captain Roland. Then, you can equip an Equip Spell to Roland so that you can Summon back Turpin. Synchro into Charles and equip Roland to him. Link that off into Charlemagne and effect to copy effects and equip Charles. Museum Summon out the equipped Charles. End Phase Angelica returns. If you were not Warrior locked, then you can get more bodies on field to make Masquerena, but it all depends on what you open.</span></p>"

Youtube Link inside!,"<div class=""elementToProof"">Branded currently is one of the top contenders for today's March 2023 meta. Able to consistently make gigantic fusion beatsticks with board clearing capabilities backed by a solid resource grindgame, Branded is currently the ultimate aggro-beatdown deck. Pushed into meta relevance by Konami because of it's fan favourite status as the ""lore"" deck of series 12, Branded post Photon Hypernova is a fusion powerhouse! </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">However, this Branded suffers from two major weaknesses: Ash Blossom (On esp. on Branded Fusion) and Nibiru. This version of Branded aims to fix that, by giving the pilot so much gas and plays to work with so that you can play through those devastating handtraps and eventually out-resource your opponent! This ""gas"" variant of Branded can keep playing, even though Branded Fusion is negated! Some hands allow the pilot to make Dragoon before you use Branded Fusion (so you can negate Ash) and before 5 summons (so you can negate Nibiru). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Dragoon is especially strong in today's meta vs. many meta decks since they all target/destroy, meaning this overpowered Deviantart OC is a nigh-invincible instant-win button!</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></p></div></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">This core of this deck is composed of the traditional <strong>Branded </strong>and <strong>Despia </strong>cards. The only card that isn't standard is <strong>Dramaturge</strong>. I personally like to use Dramaturge since he can negate Mirrorjade if you're going first, which enables 2 uses of Mirrorjade's effect rather then 1 - thus getting you more dumps in the GY from the ED and more resources. 3 <strong>Tragedy</strong> is included as a banish target for Allure of Darkness (essentially a +1!). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Bystial package</strong> is relatively small, since banishing Light/Dark monsters in the GY isn't very impactful and common in today's metagame. Lubellion is ""searcheable"" from deck since Branded Fusion dumps him to the GY,and Lubellion can summon itself from the GY by tributing the on-field Albion. Lubellion can activate from deck <strong>Branded Lost</strong> as extra protection/search power or <strong>Branded Beast</strong> for a quick effect pop during the main phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Frightfur package</strong> is included as another piece of ""gas"" in the deck - maintaining hand advantage since all the pieces search each other and giving access to Polymerization (a powerful boardbreaker with Guardian Chimera).</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> functions as a toolbox in this deck, since its 3 targets each serve a distinct function. <strong>Albaz </strong>can breakboards when summoned, and Albaz + Super Poly cracks most boards nowadays. If your opponent happens to field Dragon monsters, Albaz can contact fuse them away. <strong>Cartesia </strong>enables fusion summoning as a quick effect. Not only does she give access to Granguinol (which is a foolish burial), she can protect your activating monster effects on the field from targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. Finally, <strong>Dark Magician</strong> can be summoned from deck if you have all the pieces for Dragoon, so that you can have access to his omni-negate to deter Ash/Nibiru before you full combo. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">50 cards are utilized in this deck rather than around 40ish since every important piece (esp. Branded Fusion) is highly searcheable anyways. 50 cards also reduces the likelihood of drawing garnets and bricks. This ""gas"" version of Branded is designed to draw alot, search alot, and to play alot to overwhelm any sort of interaction your opponent has whether it is Ash Blossom, Nibiru or on-board interruption. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">""Gas"" Branded is designed to play through your opponent's interruption to create gigantic fusion beatsticks and overwhelm with high ATK and massive resource generation. If given even a second of breathing space, your opponent will find that they are facing down a field full of powerful fusion monsters!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Branded Fusion is both a blessing and a curse for this strategy. The whole deck revolves around searching and resolving that card, and if it's negated, your further options are likely limited. Your obvious glaring chokepoint and weakness is Branded Fusion, so it is imperative that you can bait out the Ash Blossom or fusion summon Dragoon before you use the card. It is advisable to use every other card first like Frightfur Patchwork, Branded Opening or Lubellion so that you can bait out your opponent's Ash Blossom. Also, from experience playing the deck, I've discovered that people intentionally hold their Ash Blossom saving it for Branded Fusion - so if you don't have the card, you can bluff having it and just do all your searches/summons from deck!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">End boards are very hand dependant, but here are the mainline combos: </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><em>Branded Fusion + Dark Monster + Discard = Mirrorjade (banish), Bystial Lubellion + Beast (pop), Set Branded in Red </em></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, sending Albaz + Bystial Lubellion from deck.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Fusion summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon by fusing Albaz + Dark Monster with Albion.

Depending on the hand, your opponent may also be dealing with Mercourier's monster negate, Dramaturge's monster negate, Masquerade's -600 burn, and Granguinol can summon Proskenion from the Extra Deck. Red-Eyes Dragoon can also be summoned, a much needed omni-negate that Branded needs. If you're lucky, you also have a facedown Super Polymerization - a devasting turn ending card if used at the right time. Your hand will likely also be sizeable and ready with follow-up for next turn since Cartesia, Alba-Lenatus and Albion generate resources during the end phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going second, Branded can slog through interruption, pierce through boards and beat down your opponent's monsters with big beatsticks. Branded is naturally equipped with in-engine ways to play going second. Polymerization fusing into Guardian Chimera is a nigh-unstoppable juggernaut since it's effect is often chainblocked with the fusion material used for it's fusion summon and it is untargetable since you used Polymerization. If Branded Opening is on the field, it also can't be destroyed! Super Polymerization can fuse away most boards in today's meta, especially with Garura, only needing 2 monsters with the same type and attribute. Muddy Mudragon can fuse away your Kashtira opponent's Diablosis + Ariseheart as well! Against the rare Dragon deck, Albaz can contact fuse their problematic Dragons away like Borrload Savage Dragon and Crystal Wing into Alba-Lenatus. Alot of interruption these days involve flipping monsters facedown, destroying and banishing (For example, Traptrix, Labrynth, Ninja and Kashtira does this alot) - Branded is very comfortable with that since they can fuse face down monsters and shuffle back banished monsters with Lubellion to fusion summon.</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Branded lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Backrow floodgates absolutely slaughter Branded, so if you're against an opponent using something like Rivalry of Warlords, it probably is time to proceed to next game! Be sure to side in backrow hate in those match-ups!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;Guardian Chimera is the best card to crack open established boards. With it's untargetability, beefy 3300ATK/DEF statline and non-targeting destruction, most boards fall to this offensive juggernaut. If your opponent negates Polymerization/Branded in Red to prevent Chimera from coming out, they have wasted a precious interaction paving the way for you to use Branded Fusion.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">The best cards to side out is the Bystial package, especially when the match-up doesn't call for them (for ex. Traptrix/Kashtira don't have light/dark for Bystials to banish). Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">If Branded Lost is active, Fusion effect's activation cannot be negated. Cards that negate the activation like Baronne De Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon and even Solemn Judgment cannot negate your Branded Fusion! Branded Lost is a perfect way to bait a negate or to guarantee your Fusion effect when you're against these threats. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">In certain common meta match-ups, Dragoon is untouchable by your opponent. If you can, try to summon Dragoon before you use key cards like Branded Fusion to guarantee it's resolution. Also, if you want to play around Nibiru, summon Dragoon before 5 summons. Dragoon is also your go-to answer when facing down Kashtira Ariseheart's macro-cosmos like floodgate and targeting banish.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></li></ul></div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof"">The culmination of the ""Abyss"" storyline also coincides with the strongest form that Branded has ever fielded. All the support for Branded over the last couple years creates a consistent, strong and resilient deck. Naturally playing through established boards while having a robust grind game is only something that few decks can boast. To see for youself how this deck performs vs. meta, I highly recommend you see the deck in action by watching the Youtube video linked below!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Our hero, Albaz has faced his enemies to ultimately triumph through trials and adversity.

This can search with Triamid Cruiser when you otherwise cannot get it into the graveyard. You can then go into a Level 7 Synchro with the Token summoned by Flora.<br /><br />Ideally, your Level 5 Synchro will be Naturia Beast, if you hard drew into your Field Spells and do not need to use Garden Rose Flora.<br /><br />Triamid Pulse is an extremely valuable trap.

At this point you can search Tally-Ho! with Champion Sargas and Regulus with Qliphort Genius afterwards.<br />- Try to always summon Kitt and then use Branded in High Spirits to send Sprind to the GY, end with any kind of Xyz with material on the field so that in the end phase Sargas can be special summoned from your deck, giving you a face-up removal + Champion Sargas additional removal immediately after.<br />- If you didn't use your Normal summon until the end, you can make sure Sargas is in the graveyard and Brothers in hand, and instead use two monsters to make IP Masquerena. Then on your opponent's turn you can summon Unicorn, discard Brothers to remove a card, then summon Sargas to have his removal on the field too.<br />- On the other hand, if you didn't use your Normal summon, you can add Cartesia to your hand with High Spirits, normal summon her, then use either a spare Kitt on the field or whatever Extra Deck monster is of no use to you anymore to summon either Rindbrumm or Mirrorjade. Rindbrumm allows for an additional negate and Albaz extender. If it leaves the field you can either bring it or Albaz right back, Albaz could use its effect to fuse with an opponent's monster and make either Lubellion or Mirrorjade.<br />- If you summoned Merrymaker without the field you can revive it with Tally-Ho! Then you can search Interluder with Branga to have a continuous omni-negate.<br />- Ash/DRNM/Called By can be replaced with any staples you want. If you want to make even more space for them you can also take out Pedor and 1 Branga. I'd say 1 Sargas but you REALLY want 1 in the Deck always, and it sucks if he's your dedicated discard target, plus you always want more Springans names available. If you want even more space you can take out Albaz and Cartesia (and if you do then also Lubellion, Mirrorjade and Rindbrumm).</p><p>You can very effortlessly end with a board of 2 or 3 removals and 1 or 2 omni-negates, plus a little bit extra disruption from either Number 38, Redoer or Dweller or whatever generic Rank 4 or 8 you prefer like Bagooska, Dingirsu, or even bring a UDF pack instead of Draglubion.&nbsp;<br />It's fun, easy to play and versatile enough to fit different strategies.

You can Normal Summon this card to directly set&nbsp;<strong>Dinomorphia Frenzy&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Dinomorphia Intact</strong> (whichever you are missing or need) and we are playing 3 copies just to have material to fusion with Frenzy. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dreaming Nemurelia</strong>. It is better to draw her than to place her directly into your Extra Deck. She places herself in the Extra Deck and places a Nemurelia Continuous Spell directly from her Deck. On the crackback, she can summon herself from the ED and banish a card from your opponent's field or GY face-down for every 3 face-down of your banished cards and recycles some of them if you have no other cards in your ED besides her. Most of your Nemurelia cards do enough banishing and we are playing Pots for more banishing, but your techs for banishing is up to your really. 3 <strong>Nemurelia Realiser, the Dreamaterializer Sleeping Princess</strong>. This card Summons itself by placing one of your monsters on the bottom of the Deck and it either books a monster or places Nemurelia in your Extra Deck from your Deck. It is better to summon this off of the Trap for interruption, but it can set up Nemurelia which is definitely something. It will get a lot better once we get a card for Nemurelia that gets her from ED to hand. 2&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dreameater - Reveil</strong>. It's a free Summon by banishing 3 ED cards and you don't need Nemurelia. It can also send a Level 10 Beast from hand or field other than it to GY to set a Nemurelia Trap. The one we have right now is okay, but it might get better with more releases. 2&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Couette</strong>. This is a free Summon if you have a face-up Pendulum in your ED and it negates Targeting effects. 1&nbsp;<strong>Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Oreiller</strong>.

Then XYZ summon into Gigantic Spright (or link summon into Dharc or Hiita first then into GS if you're ready to sacrifice the card advantage to double its attack.) Use GS effect to special summon Ipiria to draw another card (or Capshell if you normal summoned Ipiria to start the combo). Link summon using I:P and that card into Spright Elf. Now the enginge gets interesting because, as long as your opponent controls a monster you can use Spright Elf to continuously special summon I:P from the graveyard and, during your opponents turn, use I:P to go into your higher level Links, such as Knightmare Unicorn to send a your opponent's monster right back to the deck as soon as they summon it during their Turn. Other options are I:P into borrelsword to close the game out or Appollousa if the gamestate will continue for a few more turns and you'll need some negate power. And with I:P's ability, each of these will have destruction protection. If youre not able to go into Link 3 or 4, Lib the World Key Blademaster is another good support option, if you've already used World Legacy Succession, who can then set another of those.</p><p>There are other options for additional support, such as Thunderdragon Colossus. Since Sprights are Thunder type, Thunder Dragonmatrix can be easily discarded to up the attack of one, then tribute it into Colossus, and still be able to pull of the majority of the rest of the Spright engine.</p><p>If you are able to get Duel Academy in the Field Spell Zone, this combo is all the more effective, as it can burn for 1000 damage once per turn when you use a spell card (when you have a Thunder monster on the field, which you almost always will). Even better, it can raise one of your monsters' attack by 1000 if a monster effect is activated while you have a fiend or Fairy (which you will if you have any of the Knightmare link monsters or Appollousa on the field or if you summon Capshell by Gigantic Spright's effect).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even without all this combo, it is very possible to OTK your opponent with the main deck Spright Cards, if your opponent did not get out a sufficient opening board, as you can flood the field with Levell 2s and use Spright Gamma Burst to raise their attack by 1400 each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Really fun deck, very high win rate.</p>"

I used this in duelist cup event and got 10 wins in a row against mostly Spright Runick Stun players. If your opponent uses Maxx C you have a very high chance of winning by deck out. The nemeses monsters can be special summoned from your hand if you have a banished monster. This allows you to search protos or eschatos. Using mills you find out what deck your opponent is playing then summon reproductus to make any attribute or monster type for lingering floodgate of eschatos or protos. Even worse if you summonend reproductus using IP Masquerena. This makes it indestructable by card effects including your eschatos/protos giving you infinite potential lingering floodgating. You can use chaos creator to shuffle back your necroface from banish zone. The chances of starting with a bricked hand is surprisingly low considering the lack of draw power. The major weakness to this deck is Artifact Scythe or similar special summon floodgates as well as Droll &amp; Lock Bird. One potential change I would consider is swapping in left arm offering to search grass or card destruction to increase FTK chances.</p>

It's a burden.  It demands sacrifice.,"<p>The full <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> archetype and a littany of Psychic monsters.&nbsp; I wanted to heavily emphasize combos and lifegain with this one, and play-tested a fair number of times to tune it to my liking.&nbsp; I'm personally running two custom cards I made <strong><em>(link below)</em></strong> in place of <strong>Overmind Archfiend</strong> and <strong>Supernatural Regeneration</strong>, keeping those two to the side in case someone wants to play with official cards only.&nbsp; Originally I was trying out a Dark/Wind/Psychic Teledad deck with <strong>Ezmerin</strong> as the Deck Master, but it didn't work out the way I wanted, as what I really wanted was as pure Psychic deck, and I really liked the structure that the <strong>P.U.N.K.s</strong> could offer.</p><p>The game-plan with this deck is to be tricky and use your life and monsters as resources to rush through combos.&nbsp; One of the main plays is getting out <strong>Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin</strong> as fast as possible to search for <strong>Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy</strong> Tune or another <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> to start accumulating card advantage.&nbsp; Once you've got a decent board of punks out you can start filling out the rest of the board with various support Psychics.&nbsp; Sometimes it's better to hold off on using various effects, like <strong>Ukiyoei-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon's</strong> on-summoned effect, so you can bring a monster back immediately for more power or combos.&nbsp; <strong>D.D. Seeker</strong> is really useful if you have <strong>Soul Absorption</strong> out, netting you 1000 LP a round (4 players), and he can protect anything you control from battle, targeting and destruction as a quick effect, as well as prevent them (or himself) from being banished by Emergency Teleport at the end of the turn.&nbsp; I opted not to run a <strong>Psy-Frame</strong> package in this deck as you really want to maintain a board presence, but I did put in the synchros, who can help with control, lifegain off of <strong>Soul Absorption</strong>, and returning your banished cards to the GY.&nbsp; <strong>Psychic End Punisher</strong> is one of my favorites.&nbsp; Whether you have more or less LP than an opponent, he gains attack equal to the difference.&nbsp; He alone can end games with his permanent ATK buff every turn, but it gets even worse if you chain <strong>Psychic Fervor</strong> to his battle phase effect activation - taking 3500 to double his ATK, and if you're already lower than your opponent, he'll gain even more.&nbsp; He and some of the monsters that gain life when they destroy monsters by battle work really well with <strong>Psychic Snail</strong>, who allows a Psychic monster to attack twice for 800 LP.&nbsp; <strong>Aromage Cananga</strong> helps by suppressing your opponent's stats and getting troublesome backrow cards out of the way. It's okay if some of your dudes get destroyed, as you can punish them with <strong>Psi-Curse</strong> and <strong>Telepathic Power</strong>, and you've got <strong><em>TONS</em></strong> of ways to recycle all of your cards.&nbsp; <strong>Ultimate Offering</strong> helps get out monsters quickly at a negligble cost to a lifegain deck, and <strong>Future Glow</strong> can make your board incredibly oppressive if you banish a level 7-11 Psychic monster from your GY.&nbsp; The <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> spells and traps are essential for locking in a win.&nbsp; The field spell let's you summon an extra <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> every turn, and you get up to 2 free draws per turn if you pay LP to activate a Psychic monster's effect.&nbsp; <strong>Gagaku-P.U.N.K. Wild Picking</strong> and <strong>Number 26: Spaceway Octobypass</strong> will have your opponent's thinking twice before attacking you.&nbsp; And you can hold up your <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> traps as a political threat, waiting until someone has the audacity to target you.&nbsp; I would suggest testing this deck on YGOPRO / Project Ignis for a while before playing so you can get a handle on all the possible combos and how to maximize the deck's potential.</p><p><strong>My two custom cards for this deck: https://imgur.com/a/gf3eSiB</strong></p><p>As for my custom <em><strong>Tao</strong></em> monster type, they're summoned by using monsters and spells/traps as material.&nbsp; You can always use set spells and traps for material by revealing them to your opponent, so long as they meets the summoning conditions. For <strong>Ezmerin the Psychokinetic</strong>, you use <strong>Ezmerin the Psycher</strong> (main deck monster) and 2 Psychic/'mentions ""Psychic"" in its text' spells/traps to summon her. you can use dead-weight cards like a lingering monster or <strong>Brain Hazard</strong> to summon her, and the main deck <strong>Ezmerin</strong> makes whatever Psychic Extra Deck monster you summon with her untargetable by your opponent's. To give a basic rundown of my Tao monsters, Tao (the yin-yang symbols) are treated as levels and ranks simultaneously, and any effect that would effect those without specifying Xyz monsters or specific monster card type will affect them as well.&nbsp; They don't double up the effect of something like ""monsters you control gain/lose 100 ATK/DEF times their Level/Rank""; it's just the single buff/nerf, like any other monster.&nbsp; And that's it.&nbsp; You now know how to play them.&nbsp; I don't use either of them as the Deck Master, as that would require a complete overhaul of the deck, since multiple <strong>P.U.N.K.</strong> monsters don't fit into her Dark/Wind/Psychic domain, but she's fun to play either way.</p><p>Whichever way you decide to play this deck, I hope you all enjoy!&nbsp; <em>It's a blast!</em></p>"

Spright's many one card starters end on a board with multiple interruptions, negates and a decent grindgame.&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">Augmenting Live Twin with Sprights, this mischevious VTUBER duo are more powerful than ever before. As VTUBER and lightning flawlessly meld into each other and synergize, Live Twin's draw power/pop coupled with Spright's negates/grindgame create one of the strongest contenders in the Masterduel meta! (Fun fact, this deck was a finalist on a recent Masterduel tournament!)&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""elementToProof"">Harness the power of VTUBERs and LIGHTNING and electrify your Masterduel ladder opponents!</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

An emphasis on handtraps is particularly potent with Live Twins, since Ki-sikil draws you potentially 2-3 cards (once on your turn and another during your opponent's turn with Ki-sikil and Ki-sikil Frost). The handtrap line-up include the most common handtraps for Crossout Designator to negate.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">As we all know, 2 cards = Full Spright combo, and a normal summon of 1 Live Twin is enough to suffice for that. This makes each Live Twin a 1 card starter, and there are 10 cards in the deck that start your Live Twin combo (3 Lil-la, 2 Ki-sikil, 3 Secret Password, and 2 Sunny's Snitch).&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">8 Spright cards are also full combo (3 Blue, 3 Jet and 2 Starter), since they search pieces of the deck that summons more Sprights on board.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">With the Live Twins and Sprights conbined, this gives the deck a fantastic total of 18 one card starters! Each of these starters have the potential to end on a full board with 3+ interruptions, an ""Iblee lock"" and with several handtraps in hand!&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Spright Live Twin's gameplan is to interrupt and negate your opponent so much that they get out-resourced or they surrender since they've run out of options. Ki-sikil's draw 1, Lil-La's pop 1, Carrot's S/T negate, Red's monster negate, and Smasher's non-targeting banish are your main go-to choices of interruption. Most games you can Iblee lock your opponent so they cannot special summon except for link monsters, and if they try to link it away for a generic link 2 by normal summoning something, Lil-la will destroy their summoned monster to prevent the summon! I:P Masquerena is also an option, and she can be used to link summon during your opponent's main phase for Avramax or Underworld Goddess.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going first, you will establish a board with as many negations and interruptions as possible. Ideally in your hand, you should have several handtraps, especially those you drew off of Ki-sikil's effect.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going second, you will use your several handtraps to slow down or stop your opponent. If your opponent still has significant board presence you have the option to clear their board with Zeus. Summon 2 level 2s, XYZ summon Sky Cavalry Centaurea to eventually go to Zeus in main phase 2. From there, you can reset the board state, and play as normal next turn.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Here is this deck's mainline combo:&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Live Twin Lil-la + Spright Blue/Jet = Iblee Lock + I:P Masqurena, + Spright Elf revive (Blue/Jet/Carrot/Red) +&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted3"">Evil Twin Ki-sikil (draw 1) +&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted4"">Evil Twin Lil-la (Target/Destroy 1)</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Normal summon Lil-la.

Instead of summoning I:P Masqurena during the main combo, Artifact Dagda is summoned so it can set Scythe from deck. Lil-la pops Scythe during your opponent's main phase to start the lock!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">If you're going second and your opponent&nbsp;<span class=""ContentPasted6"">still has significant board presence, you can summon 2 level 2s, XYZ summon Sky Cavalry Centaurea to evetually go to Zeus in main phase 2. From there, you can reset the board state, and play as normal next turn.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof""><span class=""ContentPasted6"">Since this deck relies a lot on hand traps, it is important to know the chokepoints of each deck, which handtraps are effective to use, what the most optimal time to handtrap your opponent's strategy, etc. For example, always save your Ash Blossom for your opponent's Branded Fusion!&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""elementToProof"">It generally is safer during the current meta to summon Spright Red during your first combo to negate a possible handtrap your opponent may use (especially Ghost Ogre vs. Gigantic Spright).&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">You can cut Iblee and Spright Gamma Burst to bring this deck down to 40 cards, as they aren't essential to this strategy.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Don't play the ""Maxx C challenge"" with this deck, unless you are confident you can OTK your opponent the same turn. Otherwise, if you go full combo, you'll be giving your opponent 10+ cards!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Unfortunately, Dark Ruler No More and most common floodgates eviscerate this deck. You can't handtrap/stop those cards!&nbsp;</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Also the ceiling for pure zombies is quite low with the amount of cards needed to reach a decent end board and the lack of follow up if the opponent clears the board.</p><p>The branded engine is perfect for consitensy as it gets necroworld banshee into the graveyard with branded fusion and has a banish on field with mirrorjade.</p><p>Combos:</p><p>You want to see zombie world/ necroworld banshee, uni-zombie/ shiranui solitaire/ doomking balderoch and 1 of the branded starters. You will normally open 2 out of 3 of these based on the play tests I have done.</p><p>If you open all 3 of these combo pieces you can make dragoon with balerdroch&nbsp;in the grave and zombie world on the field which is an omni, floodgate, banish and monster negate</p><p>If you don't see a line from the opening hand that can get balerdroch in the graveyard and zombie world on the field, you do not go into dragoon on that hand instead its mirrorjade with balderoch in the grave for 2 banishes and a negate for the next turn</p><p>Both these combo lines also play around nib</p><p>If you don't open a branded starter or have a way to go into one you do the normal zombie combo because you should have drawn at least 1 starter (the deck can still brick as it wouldn't be zombies if it couldn't) go to the normal zombie line where you end on baronne and balerdroch or red-eyes zombie dragon lord, balerdroch and felgrand in graveyard depending on what zombies you opened.</p><p>Handtraps/ Board breakers: I went with ash because it does work well in the zombie deck and is good against quite a few of the current meta decks, kaiju's were the other tech choice as with how kashtira are starting to play around lava golem and sphere mode kaiju's remove the arise heart without taking away your normal summon. The deck struggles to play through to many negates so being able to tribute an omni or monster negate helps the deck greatly.</p><p>Side Deck: The side deck is pretty standard evenly is very strong in this meta, twin twister being able to discard one helps the deck more than hinders it, rivalry zombie world will win the game on its own, ra's disciple branded expulsion also will win the game on it's own, called by is necessary hand traps hurt the deck greatly and if they side them in heavily it's good to have when your going first, by main decking kaiju's you get to side deck one of the strongest board clears avaliable in kaiju slumber as well and get a free level 8 body on the board for synchro plays</p>"

This Deck is very versatile, as almost any of the Zombie staples can be splashed in. This Deck can be brutally effective against many other Decks, as ""Zombie World"", as well as changing all your opponents monsters on the field and in the Graveyard into Zombies, also stops your opponent from Tribute Summoning anything other than a Zombie monster. This negatively affects many commonly used Decks, such as&nbsp;<a title=""Bujin"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Bujin"">Bujin</a>,&nbsp;<a title=""Plant"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Plant"">Plants</a>, and&nbsp;<a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Fire_Fist"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist</a>. Many cards are designed specifically to work with the Field Spell, such as ""<a title=""Doomkaiser Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Doomkaiser_Dragon"">Doomkaiser Dragon</a>"" or ""<a title=""Trap of the Imperial Tomb"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Trap_of_the_Imperial_Tomb"">Trap of the Imperial Tomb</a>"" or even ""<a title=""Sacred Crane"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Crane"">Sacred Crane</a>"" or ""<a title=""Molten Zombie"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Zombie"">Molten Zombie</a>"" for draw power. Other cards have indirect merit, such as ""<a title=""Getsu Fuhma"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Getsu_Fuhma"">Getsu Fuhma</a>"", ""<a title=""Marionette Mite"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Marionette_Mite"">Marionette Mite</a>"", or even ""<a title=""Tutan Mask"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Tutan_Mask"">Tutan Mask</a>"" when used on your opponents to stop pesky Spells or Traps. Another good card to try is ""<a title=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Beelze_of_the_Diabolic_Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a>"", using ""<a title=""Plaguespreader Zombie"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguespreader_Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>"" you can go into any level 6 Synchro monster, then bring Plaguespreader back using its effect, then Synchro Summon again for ""Beelze"".</p><p>This Deck has many Zombie staples such as ""Pyramid Turtle"", ""Zombie Master"", ""Goblin Zombie"", or ""Plaguespreader Zombie"" if you want to&nbsp;<a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro Summon</a>. The key player in this Deck is without a doubt ""Il Blud"". ""<a title=""Kasha"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Kasha"">Kasha</a>"" can also be included, but remember that monsters treated as Zombies by the effect of ""Zombie World"" that are returned to the Deck are not counted towards its ATK. ""<a title=""Immortal Ruler"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal_Ruler"">Immortal Ruler</a>"" can also be used to recycle ""Zombie World"". Another excellent card to use is ""<a title=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Red-Eyes_Zombie_Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a>"", which allows you to Summon any Zombie which it destroys by battle. ""<a title=""Pyramid Turtle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Pyramid_Turtle"">Pyramid Turtle</a>"" and ""<a title=""The Black Stone of Legend"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Stone_of_Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a>"" can be used to search ""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""<a title=""Night Dragolich"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Dragolich"">Night Dragolich</a>"", while not a Zombie monster, can be used to support the Deck since the majority of its monsters will be Special Summoned from the Graveyard, if the likes of ""Doomkaiser Dragon"" are not being used (unless they are revived after being destroyed), which may not be the case for the opponent. ""<a title=""Curse of Dragonfire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_Dragonfire"">Curse of Dragonfire</a>"" can also be used with this Deck to not only destroy opposing Field Spells, but also Fusion Summon ""<a title=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonecro_Nethersoul_Dragon"">Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a>"" while ""Zombie World"" is on the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

All you need is either Rainbow Bridge, Crystal Bond, or Sapphire Pegasus.</p><p>1: Use <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=63945693"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/63945693.jpg"" data-card=""63945693"" data-name=""Rainbow Bridge"">Rainbow Bridge</span></a> to search for <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=9334391"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/9334391.jpg"" data-card=""9334391"" data-name=""Crystal Bond"">Crystal Bond</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p>2: Use Crystal Bond to add <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=7093411"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/7093411.jpg"" data-card=""7093411"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus"">Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus</span></a> to your hand, and to place <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=21698716"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/21698716.jpg"" data-card=""21698716"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle"">Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle</span></a> into your Spell/Trap Zone</p><p>3: Normal summon Sapphire Pegasus, and activate its effect to place <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=36795102"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/36795102.jpg"" data-card=""36795102"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon"">Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon</span></a> into your Spell/Trap Zone</p><p>4: Activate Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon's effect, banishing it to special summon another Sapphire Pegasus from your deck while adding <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=79856792"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79856792.jpg"" data-card=""79856792"" data-name=""Rainbow Dragon"">Rainbow Dragon</span></a> to your hand</p><p>5: Overlay the two copies of Sapphire Pegasus in your monster zones to special summon <a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=32530043"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/32530043.jpg"" data-card=""32530043"" data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</span></a> to an extra monster zone (placing it here gives you more room to summon cards with your tuner monsters.

I think you have to play more than one copy of this card, as it's a powerful interruption + a good protection for your field monsters (it also includes not Marincess monsters).

IMO, Pot can be annoying if you banish the field spell. But most of the time, you are supposed to use it after having searched your Battle Ocean.

It's for me a good way to start to play after some interruptions (Marincess is pretty weak to the handtraps in general), especially with Ash and Nibiru in the meta.</li><li>The use of some Marincess monsters is debatable.

If sniped by Danger! effect, Branded Fusion cannot be played. If going second, Fallen of Albaz can be normal summoned, attempting to use opponent's monsters as material for Lubellion (if dark attribute) or directly into Mirrorjade (if they have extra deck monsters on the board). Fallen of Albaz is usually best sent from the deck.</p><p>- Drawing more than 1 Branded Fusion bricks your hand significantly. Can remove copies as needed, but then limits the Branded combo likelihood</p><p>- Called By The Grave, opponent Ash Blossom, and Ghost Belle completely shut down Dark World grave effects and Branded Fusion.</p><p>- Deck is significantly lacking in draw power. If you utilize Danger!s, Dark Worlds, and Braded Fusion all in one turn, you can often be left without a hand. Maintaining at least 1 card in hand is absolutely essential for the Grapha fusion effect, but more cards in hand is always better for further discard power.

The branded side board is an idea I've been working on with regular Cyber Dragon Decks and if your opponent has a way like Necrovalley to keep you from your GY Dragunitys, they're able to be fully subbed out into a Cyber Branded list which can run fairly well in my experience.

MAX in March 2023's Duelist Cup.</p><p>Let's start by talking about ""missing the timing of activation."" Swap Frog's effect text has these two words ""when and ""can"" which is an indicator that this effect in order to activate, no event should take place after the effect's condition ""When this card is Summoned."" In my case, I activated Ronintoadin's effect (chain 1), then I chained Spright Elf to summon Swap Frog from the GY. Chains in Yu-Gi-Oh! resolve backwards, so Spright Elf summons Swap Frog (the effect must activate at this very moment and cannot wait), chain 2 resolved and we move to chain 1 summoning Ronintoadin. Chain's cannot be interrupted after they start resolving and must resolve fully before any card can be activated, so Swap Frog when it was summoned wanted to activate, but according to the rules that's illegal and since this kind of effect does not wait, it ends up missing the timing of activation.</p><p>Things to note about this deck:<br />- Spright Starter and Gigantic Spright lock you from Special Summoning above Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. In the case of Gigantic Spright, it locks both you and your oponent from Special Summoning above Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. The text also says ""For the rest of this turn"" which means you can still summon any Level/Rank/Link prior to the activation of the effect of any of these two cards.<br />- Avramax inherently cannot be targeted by any effect and your oponent can only attack him. With I:P Masquerena, Avramax gains protection from destruction. Avramax's effect to gain attack power during Damage Calculation can only work against Special Summoned monsters.<br />- If you don't have the materials to summon Number 65: Djinn Buster and you're summoning using Spright Elf while Swap Frog is in the GY, make sure to summon it to send another copy of itself to the GY for Ronintoadin. Having that extra Special Summon will always matter.</p><p>As usual, you can find the gameplay video below. Enjoy the replays! Peace.</p>"

But that doesn't mean Floo is unusable without their primary floodgate; it just means we'll have to adapt and rely on new weapons, including a new bird to the fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p>Simorgh's Winged-Beast and Wind typing make it an easy fit to the Floo system, with Elborz providing strong search potential when Magnificent Map doesn't get drawn, and Simorgh itself acting as good fodder for tribute summons.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrier's ban means that to remain viable (and as annoying as usual), we'll have to put greater emphasis on two familiar cards; Empen and Unexplored Winds. Empen's surprisingly oppressive and effective floodgating along with Unexplored Winds' strong, Super Poly-style disruption creates a strong core to build around.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than that, load your deck up with other knick-knacks like the (honestly, quite OP) Harpie's Feather Storm, which synergizes really well with Simorgh; Nibiru for Sprights and other combo decks; along with the interesting choice of Lancea, to be used against Kashtira, the spiritual successor to Tearlaments. They'll need a lot of banishing to get their work done, so a well places Lancea will send them reeling. Other than that, side deck options include Ultimate Slayer, Forbidden Lance, Cyclone, etc. AND ALSO D. Shifter, which has moved from main deck tyrant, to rogue side deck option. Banishing extra cards just makes things easier for Kashtiras, with Arise-Heart's Macro Cosmos-esque effect.&nbsp;</p><p>As a finishing note, you might be interested in the very out-of-place extra deck; it's used as a facade, a way to confuse opponents, particularly Kashtira fans and their frequent Diablosis uses, which can get them completely mistaken about your archetypes (pretty common Tearlaments-ish extra deck). You barely use the extra deck anyways, with Floo's inherent restrictions on extra deck summoning, so make use of it in a different way! You can optionally add a synchro monster for Ultimate Slayer, but I didn't because it might mess with the illusion.&nbsp;</p>"

And in case Baronne used it effect to negate Nibiru, you can always setup a Watapon via Benten being tributed for Doombroker. During your opp standby, activate Baronne effect to ss Diviner, send Trias and you can pop a card using Trias effect tributing Diviner + Watapon, so always 2 interruption-guaranteed.

Maybe both? The idea is to lock your opponent out of game by playing Rexterm or Plasma. At first, this doesn't seem like it works, but this deck is fun. So you have three lock out options, two you can use at the same time.</p><p>First one is Destiny Hero Dark Angel. You Fusion Destiny into Destiny Hero Dominence and place in defense mode. Three destiny heroes in GY are needed to activate Dark Angel and palce on opponents side of the field. Your three targets are Dreadmaster, Draw Hand, and Disk Commander. What you do is activate Dominence effect to look at the top five cards and stack them how you want. When Dominence is destroyed at the end phase of the next turn, Special Summon Dreadmaster, Disc Commander, and Draw Hand. Disc Commander and Draw Hand lets you draw 3 cards off their effect.</p><p>Second is Rexterm, Draw Therizia and search Frenzy. Set the card in your S/T zone, and fusion summon on your opponents turn. First into Kentrigina and then Rexterm. Rexterm prevents your opponent from activating monster effects if they are equal or more to your life points. Rexterm's quick effect is to half the life points and make opponents monsters equal your life points.</p><p>The Third is Plasma Plus D-Force, You get three monsters on the field, play D-Force to search Plasma and then play Plasma. Plasma is both Skill Drain and Relinquished at the same time. Easy way to get the three monsters on the field is play Fusion Destiny and summon any destiny hero monster from the extra deck but make sure your targets are Malicious and Denier. They can summon themselves from the GY. They're an easy summon, and can turbo out Plasma easy. Plasma + Rexterm just says nope to all effects and D-Force gives Plasma staying power. They're pretty formidable together and they annoy friends pretty easy too.</p><p>I wanted to post something different and see where this goes. If you build the deck, I promise you'll have fun with it. Happy Dueling.</p>"

Earn that Diamond 1 or MAX Duelist LVL!!!,"<div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">Spright Runick is arguably the current reigning champion of Masterduel meta as of March 2023. The ridiculously strong combination of Spright and Runick's smothering control and endless grind game create a deck that all strategies would have to fear and respect. Sprights ending on 3-5 interruptions (Red's monster negate, Carrot's S/T negate, Smasher's banish, and I:P Masquerena's quick link) combined with Runick's draw 3 and quick play spells generally stop any deck cold in their tracks. Both archetypes combined have a potential 10+ interruptions for your opponent to slog through, while maintaining a superior resource loop - outpacing most other strategies!</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">If you want to win and reach Diamond 1 or reach max rank in Duelist Cup in Masterduel with a relentlessly strong control strategy, you've chosen to pilot the correct deck!</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 elementToProof"">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</span><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><strong>SPRIGHT&nbsp;</strong>has 8 one card starters in the deck (3 Blue, 3 Jet and 2 Starter). In any case, if you don't open any of these cards, 2 level 2 monsters would create Gigantic Spright, leading to full Spright combo. Spright has immense synergy with Runick since their quick play spells summoning Hugin already fulfills one of the two level 2s needed for Gigantic Spright or Spright Elf!&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">There are 16 <strong>RUNICK&nbsp;</strong>quick play spells in the deck to maximize the chances of drawing 2-3 in your opening hand in a deck of 40 cards. Ideally, the duelist would use 1 quick play spell to summon Hugin, searching for Runick Fountain, 1 for the discard for Hugin's cost to search, and the last quick play spell to trigger Fountain, drawing you 2-3 cards. After Hugin is established on board, it is a level 2 - enabling your Spright combo.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">The rest of the deck is composed of <strong>STAPLES</strong>, designed to counter the current meta of Masterduel. 2 of each staple rather than 3 is used to lower the likelihood of drawing multiples of the same card. 2 Cosmic Cyclone is generally useful, and more so important in the common Runick mirror match to banish Fountain. 2 Lava Golem is used to tribute through established boards, especially when versing other Spright players. Lava Golem is great in this deck since it doesn't require it's normal summon. 2 Maxx ""C"" and 2 Ash Blossom are always really good in OCG-centred Masterduel format. Drawing more cards with Maxx ""C"" is great for keeping other decks in check while providing you with more Runick ammunition to play with.</div><div><br class=""ContentPasted2"" /><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Spright Runick's gameplan is to interrupt and negate your opponent so much that you out resource them. If they don't outright surrender, the strategy is to deck them out in an extended grind game as Spright Elf recovers/recycles Sprights in the GY and Runick Fountain draws you up to 3 cards every turn. Theoretically, your opponent will be so helpless and out-resourced that they cannot come close to attacking you for game, especially as you and your monsters hide behind your Avramax.</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Here is the mainline combo for this Spright Runick:</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Spright 1 card starter + Runick quick play spell(s) = Spright Elf, I:P Masquerena, 3-5 cards and possibly Spright Red/Carrot with a set Smashers.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><ol><li>Activate Runick quick play spell to summon Hugin.&nbsp;</li><li>Hugin searches for Runick Fountain. Discard a card for cost (Ideally you discard another Runick quick play to draw more with Runick Fountain You can also discard another Spright since it can be revived later by Elf).&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Runick Fountain. If you can trigger Runick Fountain with another quick play spell, activate it to draw 1-3 cards. It is best to do this after you finish all your searching with your Spright combo to increase your chances of drawing into more Runick quick-play spells or handtraps.</li><li>Activate your 1 card Spright starter. Do the full Spright combo! (Spright Blue -&gt; Spright Jet -&gt; Searches Starter or Smashers).&nbsp;</li><li>Use Hugin + Blue/Jet to XYZ summon Gigantic.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Gigantic's effect to summon your level 2 (Capshell/Iperia draw 1, Red/Carrot negate) of choice from deck by detaching the Spright material.&nbsp;</li><li>Link away Blue/Jet and level 2 summoned from deck to link summon Spright Elf.&nbsp;</li><li>Elf summons level 2 of choice from GY.&nbsp;</li><li>Link away Level 2 from GY + Gigantic Spright = I:P Masquerena.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have any other extenders, summon them, and set any cards you want to use in the backrow like Smashers.&nbsp;</li></ol><div>This combo should leave you with Spright Elf's quick summon from GY, I:P Masquerena's quick link, and perhaps a negate with Spright Red/Carrot. You may have drawn 3-5 cards due to Runick Fountain, Ipiria and Capshell, leaving you with many of interruptions ready in your hand. You also may have a set Smashers or Cosmic Cyclone.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>During your opponent's turn, you may have 3-10 interruptions ready for them (highly dependent on opening hand and draws). Your life points and low ATK monsters are protected as you link away Elf + Masquerena for Avramax (You can also link into Unicorn for the targeted shuffle or Underworld Goddess for blanket negate and GY summon negate). On top of that, you will continue to draw additional cards with Runick Fountain on your opponent's turn!&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Due to your immense pressure as you choke your opponent out of their possible plays and banish their deck, they will surrender in no time as they are out-resourced and out-matched!&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3""> GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><div><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you want to play safe to protect your combos, summon Spright Red early so it can negate the ever-prevalent Ash Blossom and Nibiru.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Verses S/T strategies, summon Spright Carrot to protect your plays. This is useful in Runick matchups and the occasional Labrynth player.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Little known fact, you can still successfully use I:P Masquerena in this strategy if your opponent drops Dark Ruler No More! CL1 your opponent uses Dark Ruler, CL2 you use one of your quick play spells, then CL3 I:P Masquerena activates her quick link effect! Ideally she links away your monsters (who would otherwise be negated) for Underworld Goddess, who is unaffected by Dark Ruler No More.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Avramax is the ideal I:P Masquerena link target, linking with Elf. After your opponent's first action in main phase (CL1), chain Masquerena's effect (CL2), then Elf's effect to summon from GY (CL3). Avramax is a monster many decks have difficulty outing since he is untargetable, indestructible (due to Masquerena) and mostly unkillable in battle! Your lifepoints and low ATK monsters are in good hands with him around!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If your opponent resolves Maxx ""C,"" don't continue with the Spright combo. It just isn't worth it giving your opponent 10+ cards. Your Runick cards are still a potent force!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Keep in mind that with Spright Runick, your Extra Monster Zone is used up by Spright Elf - meaning you can't protect your cards from destruction effects by summoning Hugin.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Dharc the Dark Charmer is full Spright combo. Dharc summons dark monster from opponent's GY -&gt; Link away into Spright Elf -&gt; Elf summon level 2 from GY -&gt; Elf + level 2 makes Gigantic Spright -&gt; Proceed to Spright combo!</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div></div><div><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div>I would say that Spright Runick is the ultimate meta deck as of March 2023 (If you pilot this deck, you are officially a hardcore, no-fun, meta sheep.

It does literally everything!&nbsp;</p><p>The key to this deck is getting to TDMs and/or your Fusion material monsters including and mainly DM (and his Fusions majority wise, using Dragons).

A rare props to Konami for their design choices for the support for this archetype. Granting an underpowered deck with one of the strongest forms of removal, Laevatein's ""XYZ superpoly"" fixes Generaider's problems breaking boards going second. Generaider's crippling limitations with level 9 bricks in hand is largely solved by Vala while simultaneously enabling rank 9 plays is genius!&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all, this older deck is granted new life for today's meta with two very strong support cards. Now, give your opponent the Boss Rush of their dueling career as you negate, hand-rip and XYZ super poly to victory with Generaiders!!!</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted6 ContentPasted9"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted6 ContentPasted9"">&nbsp;GLHF Duelists!<br class=""ContentPasted8"" /></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

When Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon was banned, the deck took a heavy hit, since Chaos Ruler helped majorly with consistency and play extension. However, the deck is not totally dead, as the new Chaos Synchro cards heavily increase the consistency of the Main Deck, allowing for far easier spamming of Level 8 Synchros, as well as the bigger boys, like Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, Bane, and of course, Red Supernova Dragon, as well as some new DARK Synchro Monsters, like Bystial Dis Pater, and some non-Dragons in case you're able to Summon them, like Chaos Angel and Chaos Beast.</p><p>The deck's win conditions are still mostly the same. Hope for a good hand, or use the many consistency tools to sculpt one, then go down the Crimson Resonator line into Red Supernova Dragon. This time, however, the Chaos Synchro cards help save your Normal Summon throughout the combo, making it just a little easier to play through interruption, and allowing you to continue your combo after the Supernova hits the field. A new major boss of the deck, Bystial Dis Pater, helps with interruptions. Being a DARK Dragon Synchro Monster, it combos perfectly with the two Traps, Red Reign and Time to Stand Up, allowing for it and either Trap to hold the field down until the next turn. Specifically, with Red Reign, you can banish all monsters your opponent controls in the middle of their combo (as long as you do so before they get a Level 10 or higher monster), then if they can continue further, Dis Pater can shuffle one of your opponent's banished monsters (or one of your own) into the Deck, then either negate the effect of or destroy the monster they were hoping to save their field with. Time to Stand Up is also a monster negate from the Graveyard while you control Dis Pater (or any other Level 10 or higher DARK Dragon Synchro Monster), and it's easy to set up, as it can banish itself the same turn you use its field effect to Special Summon some Resonators from your Deck, which you can hopefully use to your advantage next turn. If you wish to Special Summon Red Resonator and use its Special Summon effect to heal yourself for a phat 3500+ LP, activate it in Chain Link 1, please.</p><p>Other changes from my previous Red Dragon Archfiend deck include a smaller Rokket package; really just a trimming of the excess Rokkets, as you don't really need two Recharger or Synchron. A third copy of Tracer was shaved as well, as though it's a good Normal Summon, you'd prefer to Special Summon it with Quick Launch. Space can be made for a third copy, though. Some Extra Deck fluff was shaved. Ancient Pixie Dragon is no longer necessary, as making Level 6s and Level 8s are much easier than Level 7s with the new Chaos Synchro cards. Chaos Ruler was also removed, since it is now unfortunately banned. A second copy of Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend was included, as its name is useful, and its effect is serviceable, especially in the relatively low-ATK meta we're seeing right now. Some other cards that could be included in the Main Deck are seen in the Side. I couldn't find space (or necessity) for Chaos Mirage Dragon, Resonator Command, or Burning Soul, but they may be preferrable to some. Chaos Angel and Chaos Beast were only included because the Extra Deck isn't super tight, and they may be useful in the niche situation where you're bloated with Chaos monsters who don't lock you into Dragons. Chaos Angel's LIGHT material effect is extremely useful if you can bring it out, as activated monster effect immunity can be incredibly useful for securing the effects of your Red Dragon Archfiends. Chaos Beast is also nice as a self-recurring Synchro Material, finding itself useful for niche comebacks where you can manage to use it for Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend or even Red Supernova Dragon. Void Ogre Dragon is more useable in this version of the deck, as you can empty your hand fairly quickly with the banishing to achieve a deadily field. Hopefully Void Ogre Dragon is enough Spell/Trap negation to balance out the loads of monster negation and overall shafting that the other Synchros and Trap Cards provide. Red Resonator is also more useful than in some other versions, as the Chaos Synchro monsters in the Main Deck can be Special Summoned by any card effect, not just their own, making some awkward hands where you have no banish material playable, where even Crimson Resonator might be useless in that situation.</p><p>I hope this decklist is to your likings, Kings. This should hold us over nicely until Konami reveals the new Red Dragon Archfiend support cards we should be getting soon-ish from the semi-recently revealed Jack Atlas Structure Deck. We will all soon be the Masters of Faster, and we shall all soon rule the duels, Kings.</p>"

If it isn't low enough, use Kentregina to get it even lower!<br /><br />Diplos summons can provide support if Kentregina's already out, throwing Sonic or Brute into the grave to use from Kentregina.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you draw either Solemn card, have them set before you use Therizia or Lilith, or save them for your opponent's turn to lock-down the board.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ferret Flames compliments your low LP and can help clear away your opponent's monsters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gozen, Rivalry, and Mistake is nasty to use all at once, with Imperial Custom to support them, but limiting your spell / trap zone, rarely seen, but used with caution.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mistake counters your Fossil Digs, so make sure if you get one, use it before activating Mistake.&nbsp;</p>"
