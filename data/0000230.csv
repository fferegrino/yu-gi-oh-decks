In the side deck, there is a way to get into Dark Simorgh against back row decks. You can put ani-spell to synergize with the Dark Simorgh if you would like, but I found it not necessary. The overall goal is to get to Goliath or Sloth.  <strong>Pros: </strong>The deck actually has a surprisingly good win rate! The field spell can allow for your Saizo to become similar to a towers as long as you have a monster onboard and a ninja in the grave witch can be very useful. I've won games because my opponent cannot out Saizo and then I just drop a Goliath and win. This deck is NOT an aggressive deck and you win by staying up in resources. I find the deck very fun, and it does amazing in the grind game.  <strong>Cons: </strong>It is very meta-dependent. It is good against certain decks in our format, but that changes depending on the match-up. It does not have a great match-up against drytron and against flundereeze, the idea is to stop extra deck decks from going into the extra deck, but any level one decks also are not great because you have to improvise to get into Goliath/Sloth (I once pen summoned tribute fodder for my sloth using two monsters in my deck that just happened to be scales). Lastly, it struggles with monster removal.  <strong>Conclusion: </strong>The deck actually puts up a decent fight against most decks but is very meta-dependent. I hope you have fun with the deck! Feedback is greatly appreciated!"

The goal of this deck is to get out the Blue-Eyes Chaos dragon, most people will say it is the boss monster of this deck. The best way to get this monster out is by using the effect of the Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon. I use the White Stone of Ancients to special summon it during the end phase which adds chaos form to my hand, then since it is the end phase I also add the Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon to my hand. Next turn use a Blue-Eyes White Dragon to tribute with chaos form (alternative's name becomes blue eyes white dragon so that's a good choice). Once it is one the field it is usually game over, this deck has a dozen ways protect it so no need to worry. If you build this good luck."

We have different ways to send it to GY like foolish burial, LV8 summoned discarding from hand, machina unclaspare, etc.  In addition, we mix with infinitrack because make too easy summon Zeus making 8 + 4 (with anchor drill) or 10 + 2 (with citadel or ruinforce).  On this deck is too easy summon with links like Apollousa, Acesscode talker or Borrelsword.  Finally the side deck is thought to stop enemies limiting their spell cards or trap cards and negating summons with Jinzo and Spell Canceller both monsters are machina and make well combo with our ruinforce.  We hope you like it!!!"

The point of the deck is to stall while dealing effect damage, direct attacks, and generally frustrating your opponents. When I first made the deck, it won pretty frequently both online and in real life (still does).  You can experiment with your own traps since I just threw in what I had, and they work well.  The extra deck can also be expanded on, I just never really felt the need.  There are no boss monsters to this deck"

For those who don't know, the deck consists of spellcasters of various levels and attributes that activate their effects by discarding spell cards from your hand, this makes them seem resource intensive but all the archetype spells can add themselves back to the hand during your end phase. With the inclusion of the new fusion, the deck became much stronger even though the fusion spell is sort of mediocre. I found the deck suitable as a control deck that uses the extra deck as a toolbox, hence I chose not to run neither extravagance nor prosperity in the main deck as of the current moment.   </span>  <span><b>Deck starters going first</b><strong>:</strong></span>  <span><strong> Witchcrafters</strong> <strong>(level4 &amp; under):</strong> they tribute themselves and discard any spell to special summon another Witchcrafter of any level from deck; due to this they are very fragile to handtraps and negation, hence playing gamma and driver is necessary in this deck, and going into <a data-name=""Chaos ruler"">Chaos ruler</a> can help fill your GY with cards.</span>  <span><strong>- Witchcrafter Unveiling : </strong>Special summon any Witchcrafter monster in hand and can give your monsters immunity when activating their effects, the Witchcraft monsters already dodge <em><strong><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></strong></em> and <strong><em><a data-name=""Skill drain"">Skill drain</a></em></strong> well, they have a problem with handtraps, this can help play around them. </span>  <span><strong>-Reasoning: </strong>Automatic inclusion in the deck as they are diverse in levels and the smaller Witchcrafters have effects in the GY, you also don't mind having the in-theme spells and monsters in GY, as you can banish a spell along with <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter &lt;a data-name=&quot;Genni&quot;&gt;Genni&lt;/a&gt;"">Witchcrafter </a><a data-name=""Genni"">Genni</a> </strong></em>to extend play; recovery of card with <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Potterie"">Witchcrafter Potterie</a> </strong></em>with an empty hand; <em><strong><a data-name=""Magician's Restage"">Magician's Restage</a></strong></em> can activate adding the floodgate hands; worst case scenario the spells add themselves to hand at the End-phase when you at least placed a boss card on the field.</span>  <span><strong>-Gamma and Driver : </strong>mentioned a couple of times already, together they can help you go into chaos ruler and fill your GY, and they can also go into a link 2 like <a data-name=""Lyna the light charmer"">Lyna the light charmer </a>or <a data-name=""lambda"">lambda</a> and build up into a <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the master magicians"">Selene, Queen of the master magicians</a> for an OTK.</span>  <span><b>-Magicians' Soul : </b>Sends <strong><em>Witchcrafter</em> <em>Hanie</em></strong> or <strong><em>Madame Verre</em></strong> from deck to GY as cost, but also a free special summon with <a data-name=""Anima"">Anima</a> and <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> as a tech option, being a (Dark) [Spellcaster] makes it a wonderful inclusion in the deck with the <em><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Confusion"">Witchcrafter Confusion</a> spell</strong> </em>and a <em><strong><a data-name=""Super polymerization"">Super polymerization</a></strong></em> target. It can also be re-summoned by restage, and last but not least it helps you draw cards by discarding and/or sending spells from field or hands. All around good card that could be a staple in the main deck.</span>  <span><b>Deck starters going Second</b><strong>:</strong></span>  <span><strong>-Super Polymerization: </strong>it is an absolute beast of a card this meta, with a diverse set of targets that can hit most of the meta decks, best thing is there is little your opponent can do against you, they can't even play <em><strong><a data-name=""secret village of spellcasters"">secret village of spellcasters</a></strong></em> against you, this is especially useful because people are not ending on large boards with many negates this format, so super poly can hit <strong>invoked-Dogmatika</strong><em>(<a data-name=""Shaddoll Winda"">Shaddoll Winda</a> - <a data-name=""Mudragon"">Mudragon</a> - <a data-name=""Witchcrafter vice-master"">Witchcrafter vice-master</a>)</em> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Eldlich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(the mad golden lord&lt;/em&gt;""><strong>Eldlich</strong><em>(the mad golden lord</em></a><em>) </em><strong>Prank-kids </strong><em>(<a data-name=""Rocket ride"">Rocket ride</a>) </em><strong>Tribrigade/birds</strong><em>(<a data-name=""Guardragon Almarduk"">Guardragon Almarduk</a>) </em><strong>Common Dark types can be beat with starving venom/<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoveretum"">Predaplant Triphyoveretum</a>/<a data-name=""Predaplant Dracostapelia"">Predaplant Dracostapelia</a>(live-twins,DPE, etc........ </strong><em><strong>Swordsoul</strong> is probably the most difficult deck to out.</em></span>  <span><strong>-<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>: </strong>Thousand-eyes/Millennium-eyes into Restrict Anima, but that is probably a long stretch, both targets can be summoned w/ <strong>Magician's Restage</strong></span>  <hr />  <span><strong>Extra-deck explained:</strong></span>  <span>[5-6]cards of the deck is a fusion toolbox consisting of <strong>2 Witchcrafter Vice-master</strong>, Super-poly targets and/or instant fusion targets. Since the inclusion of the a Witchcrafter fusion monster, I've found success and synergy in using instant fusion, super polymerization. This can be reduced to 3 slots if you side/remove super-poly </span>  <span>[1 slot for a level 8 synchro], I've found most success with <strong>Chaos ruler </strong>since it can set up the graveyard for you and it can revive itself once very easily to go into access-code talker finisher, but the options are limitless depending on what you feel you need for the deck</span>  <span>[1 slot for a Rank8] <strong>Witchcrafter</strong> <b>Aruru, Madame Verre, and Vice-master are all level 8</b>: some viable options can include <strong>Dingirsu/Sanaphond the Skyprison/Number 38: Hope Harbinger/ Lancelot, </strong>the option to run a Rank8 is optional and running more than 1 is unnecessary since it rarely comes up</span>  <span>[Rest of the ExtraDeck is Links]</span>  <span><strong>Charmers</strong> compliment the deck very well, not only because they are cute girls as well, but because you run a diverse attribute of spellcasters. The most viable ones are probably Hiita, Aussa, and Lyna: most because they can summon handtraps from your opponents deck Ash Blossom/Ghost belle/Effect Veiler respectively, this sets up a guaranteed Link 3 into Selene.</span>  <span><strong>Selene + AccessCode</strong> Talker are an expensive duo to run, but it is a game closer, Access code's 5300 atk + Vice-master's 2700 atk = a clean 8000 damage, together you are guaranteed  from minimum 3 to 4 pops on the field at least, this will win you games on its own not much to say</span>  <span><strong>Artemis/Anima/Linkuriboh </strong>can place your Witchcrafters in deck, all 3 are good in certain situations but above all Artemis has the most versatility since it can be made by any of the small Witchcrafters and is a spellcaster, anima is also a spellcaster and it can catch your opponent offguard, but is a side option since they are less likely to fall for the same trick twice. Linkuriboh can be useful to blink Genni, souls and the restricts but sadly it isn't a spellcaster, so I don't blame you if you don't run it, but on field it can save you from an attack.</span>  <span><strong>Verte Anaconda/Psyframelord Lambda </strong>verte has 3 targets in deck superpoly/instant fusion/Witchcrafter confusion and if you are really bold magicalized fusion is a tech option, but try to banish souls/restrict/anima/any charmer instead of 2 Witchcrafters, since you can make use of the Witchcrafters effect or revive them with holiday. Psyframelord is a generic Link-2 that is light that can turn a dead gamma in your hand live in worst case scenario. </span>  <span>The healthy amount of Dark and light in the extradeck makes reborning Chaos Lord very easy, but it is banished when it leaves the field...unless you make a rank 8 and  detach it then you can do it again.</span>"

Special summon LinkSlayer and normal summon Alisteir the invoker (search him with meltdown) and summon salamangreat almiraj, after summon Predaplant verte and use eff to summon dark dragoon. If you have Parallel exceed you can do the same thing but you can special summon it from hand when u summon Almiraj.  If you special summon LinkSlayer but u use Onomatopaira combo and  the opponent use veiller or impremanence etc.. on gagaga sister , then u can special summon zubaba bancho from hand and summon predaplant verte and use his eff to summon Dark dragoon.  If you have Parallel exceed in hand , you can summon salamangreat almiraj using Gagaga sister and then special summon parallel exceed and then summon predaplant verte, use eff and summon dark dragoon.  TIP (only for onomatopaira combo): you have 2 predaplant verte in case the opponent use negate on the first one, so if you use onomatopaira combo and u summon the first predaplant verte ,make sure you use the first eff to make a monster dark antribute ,in this way u will provoke the opponent to use negate, and then summon the second predaplant verte and use his eff to summon dark dragoon.  Dogmatika combo and Invoker combo is same, i am lazy to write them, i will just mention this deck is not using Punishment in the dogmatika engine because here is 11 perfect starter cards (meltdown, alisteir, onomatopickup and onomatopaira) so believe me that u don't want to lock your extra deck!  In this deck is not terraforming and not 3 copies of alisteir and not 2 copies of invocation  because u already have 11 perfect starter cards in total...  The 2 Kaiju in the deck is usually to get rid of boss monster and is very helpful ,2 droplet is perfectly fine (u don't want more, sometimes u cant afford the cost)  Some TIPS:  if u are going first, Zeus in the extra deck is usually summoned using Traptrix rafflesia  If u want to use Zeus when u are going second , onomatopaira combo: when u summon beatrice and use the eff to send in gy utopic onomat. attack 1 monster and then summon zeus, use eff of zeus and the field is clear:D , after that use gagagarevenge to special summon bancho and summon predaplant verte and use eff to summon dark dragoon , or if u want to keep zeus on the field , use eff of bancho to sp. summon utopic onomat. from gy and summon traptrix rafflesia .  so is your choice if u want only dragoon or zeus(no materials) + traptrix rafflesia.  &nbsp;  In the side deck is sacred tree beast, u can summon it by gagaga magician and gagagawind. how:  onomatopaira combo: take gagaga sister + gagaga magician, summon gagaga sister and use eff to take gagagawind. use gagagwind and summon gagaga magician, use eff to make him level 7, use eff of sister to make them level 9 and summon sacred tree beast.  i am lazy to write more combos, the deck is good. enjoy  &nbsp;  CREATED SPECIALLY BY ME: DENIS.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Small world: this gives the deck a leap in consistency! If you banish Uni-zombie from your deck you can seach for Yuki-Musume, Hajun and Eldlich the Golden Lord.  &nbsp;  In the end Mayakashi have some nice mechanics but dont have enough extenders to make a good pure deck and the floating effects can be easily evicted by non-destruction effects.  !UPDATE:Added Zombie Reborn and Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Rocket"", known in the OCG as either ""Vullet"" or ""Varrett""[1] (ヴァレット Varetto), is an archetype of DARK Dragon monsters used by Roken Kogami/Varis in the Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS anime. All ""Rokket"" monsters are legless, mechanical Dragons, with heads shaped like various types of ammunition, and green hard-light wings (except ""Silverrokket Dragon"" and ""Rokket Caliber"", whose wings are magenta).  Sorry for the deck list, I put ""Magnarokket Dragon"" from side deck to main deck and put ""Dinowrestler Pankratops"" to side deck. So, the total of the main deck is 44 card decks.  Strategy for this deck : 1. Make sure when you use the ""Dragunity Remus"" Special Summon effect from the graveyard you already summoned ""Crystron Halqifibrax"" first.  2. You can use the dragunity engine first according to the fifth combo in this video to counter Nibiru from opponent hand.  3. ""Dragunity Remus"" can be replaced if you have an extender in hand. So, when you've used the effect to summon ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"" you can still run combos as usual.  4. For the fourth combo you must pay close attention to what you have in your hand and keep in mind that ""Dragonity Remus"" can be replaced if you have an extender in hand, so you don't need to use 2 copies of ""Dagon Ravine"".

Any feedback I would be immensely grateful, I didn't watch Zexal's anime, but I fell in love with this archetype.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Atualization 1</p> <p dir=""ltr""><span><span>portanto, deve ser ignorado quando pelo Galaxy Expedition e Galaxy Trance, a melhor combinação com ele, até onde testei, é usar o efeito Galaxy Soldier, descartando um Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon adicionado ao Galaxy Knight do deck, convoque-o para seu efeito e convoque o ""Dragão de Fótons de Olhos de Galáxia"" do cemitério. </span><span>Tirando essa carta, não há muito mais a acrescentar, Accellight ainda é uma boa carta, mas com uma limitação um tanto chata, lembro-me de uma ou duas vezes que tive Galaxy Knight em minha mão pronto para puxar um Photon Dragon do cemitério. </span><span>, mas eu não pude por causa do efeito Accellight, Return Of Dragon Lords provou ser uma ótima carta, pois além de convocar os dois dragões do deck principal (Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon e Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon) do cemitério,</span></span></p> <p dir=""ltr""></p>"

It's the only archetype from GX that I remotely enjoy, and honestly, that may be because it only uses fusions lol. Anyway, this deck should be good for use, however, the only thing I see bad with it is bricking with all spells/traps. But let's focus on the strat.  <em><span><strong>DECK STRATEGY</strong></span></em>  The first thing you want to look for is your deck to hand cards, like <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Frame"">Ancient Gear Frame, and </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Wyvern"">Ancient Gear Wyvern. Then, no matter first thing you get is </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion to get out one of ya boys from the extra deck. I would personally get out </a><a data-name=""Chaos Ancient Gear Giant"">Chaos Ancient Gear Giant since it's the only one with 3 copies in the extra deck, and it's the deck master.</a>  The next thing you have to do is hold out for more fusions cards, whether you add them to your hand or draw them. GET OUT <a data-name=""ANCIENT GEAR MEGATRON GOLEM"">ANCIENT GEAR MEGATRON GOLEM, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. It allows you to get out </a><a data-name=""Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem"">Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem without using a fusion card like </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Fusion"">Ancient Gear Fusion</a><a data-name=""Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem""> or </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"">Ancient Gear Hunting Hound.</a>  Finally, just absolutely f**kin beat down your opponent. Try your best to get out <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound"">Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound, since it can help OTK. You don't have to, but it'll help secure the win.</a>  <em><span><strong>OTHER STRATEGIES</strong></span></em>  <em><strong>Reactor Dragon Assembly Summon/Reactor Dragon Backrow Protection</strong></em>  To do this, the thing you want to do is keep searching the Ancient Gear cards that have destruction effects. For example, <a data-name=""Geartown"">Geartown lets you special summon 1 Ancient Gear monster from your hand, deck, or graveyard when destroyed. Look for cards like that, and get them on the field. And then, you NEED to get out </a><a data-name=""Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon"">Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon, so you can destroy those cards to get more summons in during the battle phase. USE </a><a data-name=""ANCIENT GEAR GADGET"">ANCIENT GEAR GADGET FOR ITS SUMMON!!! This allows it to attack twice, so you need it to maximize spell destruction and then summons.</a>"

In the Zombie Madness decklist I left the 2 new rules that will be used from now on in the series, but to summarize:  - The Deck's plyastyle must play around thier boss monster, and said boss monster must be featured at 3 at all times. However, this is one of the Structure Decks where a special case happens that more than 1 monster is featured in its cover. In that case, there has to be a combination of 3 cards along said monsters. - The Extra Deck must be built depending on the time the Structure Deck was printed and if it has any Extra Deck monsters or has access to them.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> One thing some people don't know is that this Deck forms part of an new OCG series of prebuilt decks known there as the R Series (which I'm gonna assume stands for Revisited given the nature this Decks tend to have). This series focuses on one thing: take an old Structure Deck, retrain their main Boss Monster with a better array of effects, add a few new playmakers that fill the theme of both the Deck and the current meta and it's ready to go. In this case, alongside creating a new version of Zombie World's boss monster, they also added another one and splashed some new cards that not only interact with Zombie monsters but also when Zombie World is live.  On a kind of rare situation, this Deck features 2 boss monsters. First we have <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong>, which is a retrain version of <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>. Is a Level 7 DARK Zombie Synchro monster and requires a Tuner and 1 or more non-Tuners. It gains 100 ATK/DEF for each Zombie monster on the field and both GYs. Also, when another Zombie monster is destroyed by battle, it can Special Summon one Zombie monster from any GY to your field. Even if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on the field or not, Necro Dragon can turn into a good beater that its revival effect acts more like recovery for your destroyed monsters. But if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on, its stats can go way higher, can steal some good playmakers from the opponent's GY and can use them for any Extra Deck play needed.  The other Boss Monster is <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong>, a Level 8 DARK Zombie with 2800 ATK/2000 DEF. During the Standby Phase, if this card is on the GY while a Field Spell is on the field face-up: you can Special Summon it on face-up Defense Position. Also, once per Chain you can activate 1 of these effects on response to the effect activation of a Zombie monster: -Negate that effect. -Banish 1 monster on the field or either GY. All of this effects are hard OPT, but their usefulness more than compensates for it. It returns every turn, making it a reliable material for Xyz and Link plays as well as being hard to get rid off, and his effects can be triggered by your own monsters or the opponents', so you can apply the banish effect each turn and apply the negates against your opponent.  Since the new rule says that a combination of 3 cards must be used among these cards, I went with 2 Doomkings and 1 Necro Dragon, giving that this deck can have a quite generous Extra Deck toolbox. As for their playstyle, they take the focus on GY and monster stealing that Zombie World started and reinforced it, as well as giving them new tools to access their higher Level monsters and Extra Deck faster.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>*Eldlich the Golden Lord</strong>: Easy to summon body with high stats and good effects, even if this Deck runs more monsters than backrow. <strong>*Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom</strong>: Another easy to summon monster than can tribute 1 Zombie monster to revive another one with a different name. <strong>**Doomking Balerdroch</strong>: One of the two Boss Monster of the Deck, granting disruption and being hard to get rid off. <strong>*Jack-o-Bolan</strong>: Easy summoning condition. Can revive a Zombie monster from any GY at the cost of banishing himself for the rest of the turn. <strong>***Necroworld Banshee</strong>: Main searcher and protector of Zombie World. <strong>***Gozuki</strong>: Zombie miller. It can Special Summon a Zombie from the hand if he is sent to the GY. <strong>***Mezuki</strong>: Can banish itself from the GY to revive a Zombie monster. Very useful for play extension. <strong>***Shiranui Solitaire</strong>: Can tribute any Zombie monster to Special Summon a Zombie from the Deck with 0 DEF. Gives access to 2 of your main Tuners. <strong>***Uni-Zombie</strong>: One of your main Tuners. Can dump a Zombie from the hand or Deck to change the Level of a monster. Accesible by Solitaire's effect. <strong>***Glow-Up Bloom</strong>: Your other main Tuner, but you will mostly use it for its GY effect. Can cheat out or search high Level Zombie monsters from the Deck, depending if <strong>Zombie World</strong> is on the field. <strong>**Book of Life</strong>: Good revival card for Zombie decks, but requires setup. <strong>*Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>: Backrow removal. <strong>***Monster Gate</strong>: Really useful if paired with Bloom, Mezuki or Gozuki. <strong>*Upstart Goblin</strong>: Giving that there are more non-DARK monsters on the Main Deck, using Allure of Darkness can be risky. <strong>*Card Destruction</strong>: Hand refresher. <strong>*Foolish Burial</strong>: Simple mill effect, giving that any monster can benefit from it. <strong>*Monster Reborn</strong>: Simple revival effect. <strong>***Zombie World</strong>: Your Homeland. Lets most of your bigger monsters to interact with your opponent's field and GY. <strong>*Metaverse</strong>: Can search or activate <strong>Zombie World</strong> directly from the Deck. <strong>***Rivalry of the Warlords</strong>: If paired with <strong>Zombie World</strong>, it can heavily slow your opponents plays. Prone to removal though.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong> <strong>*Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 8 Synchro that can potentially add 1 LIGHT or DARK monster from your Deck to the hand while also milling 4 cards.

If haven't read the new rules for this challenge, I'll summarize:  - The built decks now must focus on the main boss monster's playstyle and must be featured at 3 at all times. - The Extra Deck must be built around if the Deck even has Extra Deck monsters or had access to depending the era it was printed.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> Being printed during the 5D's era, Zombie World bring a whole new wave of support to the Zombie playstyle, mostly the GY manipulation part, and decides to add new cards that interact with Zombie monsters from your opponent's GY. How? Because of the namesake of this Deck is printed, <strong>Zombie World</strong>. It also decides to add a new playstyle to the Zombie mechanics, that being changing the types of all monsters to Zombies and stealing monsters from the opponent's GY.  Their featured Boss Monster is <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>. Is a Level 7 DARK Zombie with 2400 ATK/2000 DEF that can be Tribute Summoned in Attack Position using only 1 Zombie monster as Tribute. When it destroys a Zombie monster by battle and sends it to the GY: You can Special Summon it to your field. Like a repeating case with the last decklist, this deck offers another ways to Summon him quicker, although its summoning condition is not that restrictive either. If you're crazy enough, I guess you can mix Red-Eyes support to this build to search him faster or reviving him, but I'll leave that to your preference.  Giving that this deck was printed during the 5D's era, it will feature some Synchros and Fusion monsters, but I enssured no way-too-recent monsters were on it.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>Main Deck:</strong> <strong>***Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</strong>: Main Boss Monster. It steals any Zombie monster it destroys by battle and is fairy easy to summon. <strong>***Paladin of the Cursed Dragon</strong>: Solid Level 4 beater. Can revive any Level 4 or lower Zombie monster from your opponent's GY that was destroyed by battle. <strong>***Necroworld Banshee</strong>(Outside Support): Can both protect Zombie World as well as activating more copies from the hand or Deck. <strong>***Zombie Master</strong>: By discarding a monster it can revive a Level 4 or lower Zombie monster from any GY. <strong>***Mezuki</strong>(Outside Support): Can mill a Zombie OPT and it can Special Summon a Zombie monster from the hand if it is sent to the GY. <strong>***Pyramid Turtle</strong>: Really good floater. Can float even into REZD. <strong>*Spirit Reaper</strong>: Emergency battle staller. <strong>**Plaguespreader Zombie</strong>: Main Tuner of the Deck, can revive itself by returing a card to the top of the Deck. <strong>**Book of Life</strong>: Revival card for Zombie monsters but requires setup. <strong>*Pot of Avarice</strong>: Recycling and draw power. <strong>**Dragon's Mirror</strong>(Outside Support): Used to summon Nethersoul. <strong>*Card Destruction</strong>(Outside Support): Hand refresher, giving that some monsters can work well on the GY and can let you use Book of Life turn 1. <strong>*Terraforming</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs Zombie World. <strong>***Call of the Mummy</strong>: Zombie-themed Valhalla. <strong>***Zombie World</strong>: Turns all monsters on the field and GYs to Zombies and neither player can Tribute Summon except Zombie monsters. Main enabler for most of your playmakers. <strong>***Waboku</strong>: Battle protection. <strong>***Bottomless Trap Hole</strong>: Disruption for your opponents' summons. Extra Deck: <strong>**Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>: Cannot destroy monsters by battle but it reduces its ATK to 0 and spawns a Token with ATK and Level equal to that monster's. Accesible with Dragon's Mirror due to being and original Dragon-type. <strong>*Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree</strong>: Generic Level 10 Synchro with targeting protection. <strong>*Giganticastle</strong>: Generic Level 9 Synchro that can be a large beater. <strong>*Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong>: Enough explaining why, is just Trish. <strong>*Iron Chain Dragon</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro. Good beater with milling effect. <strong>*Red Wyvern</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro with potential Quick monster removal. <strong>*HTS Psyhemuth</strong>: Generic Level 6 Synchro that can banish any monster it battles alongside himself. <strong>**Doomkaiser Dragon</strong>: Steals any Zombie monster from your opponent's GY when Special Summoned by any means.

Well, after finally entering the last weeks of school I finally have some time to bring you said decklists. Also, I mentioned there would be changes in how I would continue this challenge, in the form of 2 new rules:  - Almost all Structure Decks have a portrait monster that indicates the Structure Deck's boss monster(s). So, for every decklist for this challenge from now on most feature said monster at 3 copies. In case that more than 1 monster is featured, to add a bit of difficulty, you can only use a combination of 3 cards among those monsters but all must be featured. Lastly, the entire playstyle of the decklist must play around either that monster(s) playstyle or turbo-ing out ASAP.  - To give more ambience to the Decklists for the time they were printed, depending if they have Extra Deck monsters and the time they dayviewed, the status of the Extra Deck will change. For example: Zombie Madness will not feature an Extra Deck, Zombie World will have one, but made mostly of not-so-recent Synchros and Fusions; and Zombie Horde giving that it is the most recent one has an Extra Deck with any kind of card.  So, with these explanation cleared, I bring to you the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong> for the <strong>Zombie Madness Structure Deck</strong>.  <strong>ANALYSIS</strong> As its name states, Zombie Madness is a Structure Deck based around a Zombie-themed Deck. Giving how old this Deck was printed, it did help to show how even today Zombies' playstyle, being having a lot of GY plays.  This decks' boss monster is <strong>Vampire Genesis</strong>. Is a Level 8 DARK Zombie monster with 3000 ATK/2100 DEF and it cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, must be Special Summoned from the hand by banishing 1 Vampire Lord you control and cannot be summoned by other ways. OPT: You can discard 1 Zombie monster to target another one in your GY with a lower Level than the discarded monster and Special Summon it. <strong>Vampire Lord</strong> is a Level 5 DARK Zombie with 2000 ATK/1500 DEF. If it inflicts battle damage to the opponent: You can declare either Monster/Spell/Trap cards; then your opponent must send to the GY one card of the type declared, at their choice. Also, if this card was destroyed by and opponent's card effect: It Special Summon itself back during your next Standby Phase. There's a high chance you might not recognize either of them if you played/played against current-time Vampire decks giving that both monsters can't help out with their new playstyle even if they have good Levels for their Xyz. However, said Vampire support can help out to search them out and some of the support from this same Structure Deck can cheat out Lord a bit faster.  As for their playstyle, it revolves around Special Summoning Zombie monsters and milling. Yes, milling is also consider to be Zombie's secondary playstyle.  <strong>BREAKDOWN</strong> <strong>***Vampire Genesis</strong>: Main Boss Monster of the Deck. Largest body and can bring Zombies from the GY. <strong>*Dark Dust Spirit</strong>: When Normal Summoned or flipped, it destroys all other face-up monsters on the field. One off as an emergency nuke giving its Spirit monster nature. <strong>***Vampire Lord</strong>: Necessary to summon Genesis, easy to summon and tolerable stats/self-revival. <strong>***Pyramid Turtle</strong>: When destroyed by battle, it can float into any Zombie monster from your Deck with 2000 or less DEF. Except for Genesis, it can float into any Zombie from this Deck, more importantly Lord and Spirit Reaper. <strong>***Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower</strong>: Cannot be targeted for attacks if you control another Zombie monster, including another copy of itself so you can prevent your opponent from attacking them at all. Also, each time you Special Summon a Zombie monster on your field, it mills the top 2 cards from your opponent's Deck. <strong>***Spirit Reaper</strong>: Cannot be destroyed by battle, but it self-destructs if it is targeted by a card effect. Mainly used for stalling out battles. <strong>**Vampire Follower</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs ""Vampire"" backrow when Special Summoned and it can revive itself from the GY. <strong>**Vampire Familiar</strong>(Outside Support): Searchs ""Vampire"" monsters when Special Summoned and it can revive itself from the GY. Main searcher for Genesis and Lord. <strong>***Allure of Darkness</strong>(Outside Support): Giving that this deck runs a lot of DARK monsters, it adds that necessary draw power. <strong>***Book of Life</strong>: It targets a Zombie on your GY and one monster on your opponent's GY, then it Special Summons the first target while banishing the second. A brick on turn 1 but useful later. <strong>***Mystical Space Typhoon</strong>: Quick-play backrow removal. <strong>***Call of the Mummy</strong>: Basically Valhalla for Zombie monsters. <strong>*Vampire Kingdom</strong>(Outside Support): Boosts Zombie monsters and turns Lord's and Bone Tower's mill effect into a potential destruction effect as well. <strong>*Vampire Takeover</strong>(Outside Support): Activates Kingdom from the Deck and revives a ""Vampire"". One of Follower's main searchs. <strong>*Vampire Awakening</strong>(Outside Support): Special Summons a ""Vampire"" monster from the Deck but destroys it during the End Phase. Useful to summon Familiar/Follower to search. <strong>***Torrential Tribute</strong>: Another emergency board wipe. <strong>**Compulsory Evacuation Device</strong>: Targeted bouncing effect."

Thanks to all the people who took the time to look through these decks, and possibly even tried them out. I'm here hoping everyone has fun, 'cause that's what matters when playing yugioh, right?  Thank you, goodnight."

And also a Fate/Grand Order reference.),"  My third Albaz deck in a row this week. For today, I got an Eldlich Albaz deck profile, named after one of Japan's most famous fairy tales and Fate/Grand Order's strongest Servants, Sakata Kintoki. AKA, the Golden Boy!  ...I'm not even joking. Kintoki's original name ""Kintaro"" literally means ""Golden boy"" in Japanese. And his father was a dragon, while his mother was a man-eating witch. So the name is kind of appropriate.  &nbsp;  Although this deck runs a total of 12 hand traps--14 if you count Eldlich the Golden Lord, you would rather be going first most of the time so you can set up as many negates and disruptions as possible. Eldlich is one of the best monsters to send to the Graveyard with Branded Fusion, since it can then revive itself if you send a set Spell/Trap on your field to the Graveyard.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Almost like modern day dinosaurs, thoses (almost all the time) little creatures are in every continent of our world while being one of the most common animals that you’ll see.</span>  <span>One of the most famous birds is the not so impressive </span><b>Arctic tern </b><span>(</span><i><span>Sterna paradisaea) </span></i><span>, a bird that flies enormous distances compared to another being, almost 70. 000 kilometers (in normal units) or 46. 000 miles (in burguer units), travelling literare around the world. And that journey, my fellow traveler, is where </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>starts.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Let’s begin our journey</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Above everything, the </span><b>Floowandereeze archetype</b><span> is about a journey of 3 littler Arctic terns (the </span><b>Floowandereezes)</b><span> flying in their migratory route, from Greenland or Iceland to the Antarctic continent. It has a control style of play, with so many cards that are stalls on leg, like  </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a> </b><span> who prevents any special summon  monsters from active its effect while in atk mode or, </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"">Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl</a> </b><span>who is a evolution of</span><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Ultimate Conductor Tyranno&lt;/b&gt;""> <b>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</b></a><b>, </b><span>that can flip face down any special summon monster  in your opponent field. But how does this deck work?</span>  <span>Unlike any other meta contender this deck doesn't perform any special summon. At first this sounds weird, doesn't it? But don’t fear, my fellow traveller,because our destiny point will guide us along the way. Every low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster has the effect that when you normal summon it an effect is activated and soon after you can perform another normal summon, with the down side that prevents you to special summon in this turn.</span><span> Furthermore, when they leave the field they go to the banned pile instead of  GY, while letting your GY completely empty. Thus , you lose your monster , right? WRONG!!  When you normal summon a winged beast monster the can be added to hand once more, even if it were tributed in this right moment.</span><span> “</span><i><span>The best way to describe Flundereeze is if a True Draco player and a monarch player made custom cards together” </span></i><span> once said </span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/giogio/""><b>GioGio</b></a><span>.</span>  <span>We have cards like </span><b></b><a data-name=""&lt;b&gt;Floowandereeze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp; Eglen&lt;/b&gt;""><b>Floowandereeze</b><b> &amp; Eglen</b></a><b> (</b><span>representing the USA) and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Floowandereeze &amp; Robina</a> (</b><span>representing England) </span><b>, </b><span>that are starters of this deck . The first one searches any Winged-best with +7 star then you can normal summon winged beast monster from your hand, and the latter one can search any -4 star from you deck then normal summon any  winged beast monster from you hand. That is superb because </span><b>Robina </b><span>can used as an extender to add </span><b>Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds or D. D. Crow </b><span> to your hand, and summon it after you out a big board monster or you can search any low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> to help in yours plays; </span><b>Eglen </b><span>in other hand bring to you hand cards like the already mentioning </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"">Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl</a> </b><span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a>, </b><span> and further cards like </span><b><a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>, </b><span> the </span><b>Apex </b><span>being a excellent negate and </span><b>Simorgh, Lord of the Storm </b><span> a really annoying card, but almost every time you’ll search </span><b>Empen,</b><span> because it has an ability of search any spell / trap </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> card.</span>  <span>Other low level </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monsters are </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan"">Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan</a> </b><span>(representing my home country, Brazil)</span> <span>and </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Stri"">Floowandereeze &amp; Stri</a> </b><span>(representing the Sahel region from Africa, possibly Sengal or  Mauritania). </span><b>Toccan</b><span> can add any </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>card that is banished to your hand then soon after normal summon any winged monster from your hand;  The angry </span><b>Stri is your</b><span> portable</span><b> D. D. Crow, </b><span> that can banish any card from either Gy to perform its </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>effect</span> <span>being a powerful interrupt in the opponent turn. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>The friends along the way</b>  &nbsp;  <span>As I said before, the GY is empty , so you can use the most devilish tech in this format, </span><b><a data-name=""Dimensional shifter"">Dimensional shifter</a></b><span>, a portable  </span><b><a data-name=""macro cosmo"">macro cosmo</a> that</b><span> can literally extort your opponent to pass his/her turn. And the most deadly of all, you can use it further down the duel because you GY will be almost every time empty.  Did This angry dude mess with this deck? Absolutely no, he is almost an  honorable  </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster.</span>  <span>Pots will be our “baggage” in specific: </span><b><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> </b><span>and</span><b> <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality .</a> </b><span>The first one would be better if were a Prosperity, but you can never complain about what you have, and the second one is perfect since you don’t have to special summon. They can fulfill your hand in no time and accelerate your plays. Another special  baggage is </span><b><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></b><span>, an awesome card to search any low level </span><b>Floowandereeze.</b>  <span>Our map to fortune is </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map"">Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map</a>,</b><span> which (alongside </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town</a>)</b><span> is one of the most powerful items in your journey. It grants you the ability to have an extra normal summon by revealing a </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster and banishing a different  </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>card  from your deck and then normal summoning that first monster... phew... and if you a another low level </span><b>Floowandereeze, </b><span> you can add to your hand by its effect and is not over yet: if your opponent normal summon a monster , you can normal summon a </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span>monster from your hand, in another word, in case that your opponent interrupt your plays you can know play in his/her turn like nothing really happened. </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town</a> </b><span> does the same thing, with an additional effect that you can banish this card and flip face down every monster that were special summon  in your opponent turn. Both of these cards are what make this deck so fearsome to play against.</span>  <span>For our final </span><b>Floowandereeze </b><span> card we have </span><b><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds"">Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds</a>: </b><span>an archetype Soul exchange card.

Just stick a Lvl 4 Toon Monster with Toon Kingdom and wait for the payoff. Do additional deck filtering with the strange Goblin Circus, or shut down opponent removal forever with Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell - especially since you don't always need your second Toon Table of Contents.  &nbsp;  A little hard to call this casual with the cost of Toon Black Luster Soldier and Toon Bookmark.
