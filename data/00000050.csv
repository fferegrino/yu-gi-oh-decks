Snake-Eyes has won the last 8 YCS, and a lot of duelists are absolutely bored and burnt out (pun intended lol) of this fire-centric meta that Ms. Diabellestarr has been dominating. Can't wait until this stale tier 1 deck is finally phased out for something new! Until then... It's good to learn what the best deck of the format does. <br /><br />The Snake-Eyes engine is straightforward enough - everybody and their mom knows what the cards do and what the optimal combos are by this point. The staples are included specifically to hardcounter the handtrap heavy meta of the current TCG format - hence the Crossout Desginators along with it's banish targets. The sidedeck is full of cards that metagame certain strategies. <br /><br /><a href=""/deck/wanted-seekers-of-masters-1-guide-to-snake-eye-february-2024-442326"" rel=""nofollow"">If you want a detailed guide on how to play this deck, check out my earlier article by clicking here. </a></p><p>If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!</p><p><em><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?
