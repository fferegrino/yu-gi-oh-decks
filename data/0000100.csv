Goal is to use Isolde to start Needlefibre combos that end on Apollousa or Mechaba while searching you Faris and a HERO monster for its effect. This makes Vyon into a back-up starter, which can go into Isolde through either Malicious, or Sunrise. Fire Flint Lady improves this by being full combo with Stratos, while also letting you search Mask Change by searching and summoning Shadow Mist. Armageddon Knight is full combo by itself, sending Mally, then Shadow Mist after Cross-Sheep summons it. Dark Rose fairy is a free Extender during the combo, but is here to facilitate Arma Knight combos when you see your other bricks, reducing the number of hands that brick out. Extra Deck is all about turboing out your negate(s) and then using HERO and fusion spells to top off your board. Flame Swordsman into Cross Crusader bridges the gap between Cross-Sheep and Wonder Driver, which is useful for resetting Mask Change. Flame Swordsman can also be decent to end on in this deck in low-end boards, since it has a good floating effect, while having Cross Crusader gives you back-up HERO plays you can make when you are forced to Faris early."

Going first, you can set up <strong>Zombie World</strong> and a <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong>. Going second, you have handtraps maindecked already like <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> and you can deal with backrow and negates with <strong>Twin Twister</strong> and<strong> Super Polymerization</strong>.

Maindeck supplements <strong>Balerdroch</strong> Turbo. 3 <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong> instead of 2 as <strong>D.D. Crow</strong> and <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> exist. 3 <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> for your main tuner plays and for sending cards to the grave. 2 <strong>Glow-Up Bloom</strong> to get large bodies like <strong>Doomking</strong> and <strong>Jack-o-Bolan</strong> out onto the field or to search lv 5 or higher zombies like <strong>Vampire Fraulein</strong>. 3 <strong>Shiranui Solitaire</strong> to summon <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> or <strong>Glow-Up Bloom</strong> from deck. 3 <strong>Mezuki</strong> which you can choose to play at 2 who summons zombies from grave. 2 <strong>Necroworld Banshee</strong> to ensure a <strong>Zombie World</strong> on the field. 2<strong> Vampire Fraulein</strong> for BP assurance. 3 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> since it can trigger <strong>Doomking</strong>. And 1 <strong>Jack-o-Bolan</strong> since its boneless <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>.

Spells and Traps are just ways to get grave setup. 1 <strong>One for One</strong> to summon <strong>Bloom</strong>. 3 <strong>Twin Twister</strong> for backrow and for that discard. 3 <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> to deal with your opponent's board and for a form of interruption when you set it on turn 1. 1 <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> for that grave setup. 1<strong> Card Destruction</strong> to setup your grave and to get targets for <strong>Jack-o-Bolan</strong> and <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>. 1 <strong>Called By the Grave</strong>. 3 <strong>Zombie World</strong> which is the best floodgate. 2<strong> Rivalry of Warlords</strong> for the <strong>Zombie World</strong> lock. 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> for some disruption.

Extra Deck isn't that important so you can choose to play <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong> if you want. 1 <strong>Predaplant Triphyoverutum</strong>, 1 <strong>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>, and 1 <strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong> for your <strong>Super Poly</strong> targets. 1<strong> Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong> for the mill effect. 1 <strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong> for recycling banished cards and looping cards. Ironically 1 <strong>Rampaging Smashtank Rhynosaber</strong> since it's synchro<strong> Nyarla</strong> who can tag out into materials for a lv 7 synchro which would be <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong> which is a massive body and it has a similar monster-stealing effect to <strong>Fraulein</strong>. 1 <strong>Number 22: Zombiestein</strong>. It's a body and a negate and you can make it so yea. 1 <strong>Unchained Abomination</strong> for removal. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong> which negates all banished effects and it also a potentially 2 negates per turn. <strong>Union Carrier</strong> to equip <strong>Mezuki</strong>. <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong> to summon <strong>Bloom</strong>. <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong> for draw power and tribute summoning <strong>Doomking</strong> LULW. <strong>Avendread Savior</strong> for grave set-up which is sent as cost. <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> to get <strong>Bloom</strong> into the grave.

Side Deck: 2 <strong>Kasha</strong> for shuffling your opponent's board into the deck. 3 <strong>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</strong> since it triggers <strong>Doomking</strong>. 3 <strong>Ghost Meets Girl - A Shiranui's Story</strong> to get out <strong>Solitaire</strong>. 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> for more removal. 3 <strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong> which works well with<strong> Zombie World</strong>.

<strong>Draculea Vampire</strong> is bad end of story."

No better way to surprise people than with crystal beasts.","This deck will ALWAYS put two monsters on the board using Zenith. With two crystal abundance you can OTK using Nr 60: Dugares but that isn't the deck focus.

It is purely focused on Rainbow Dragon, Rainbow Overdragon and Rainbow Neos

3x anti-spell fragrance was a tech idea I was brainstorming to encourage enemies to actually battle your monsters more (and proc the rainbow dragon traps).  Feel free to swap for any other trap/hand trap.

Deck is very consistent- only brick in deck is 2x Neos (hard brick) and 3x Rainbow Dragon (soft brick).

&nbsp;

Crystal bonds &gt; Pegasus (put Zexal in spell/trap zone ALWAYS when you get the option). Then use Pegasus effect to put another Zexal on the field as a spell.

Then use rare value or crystal beacon to milk value.

Go into XYZ / Predaplant for Rainbow Neos"

<p><span>Key Cards In The Deck/Extra Deck</span></p>

<ol>
 	<li><span> <span>Battlin Boxer <span>Sparrer</span></span> : This Card Is the best <span>Battlin Boxer</span> to date, it is an important extender and can be used to make Rank 4 Monsters. <span>Sparrer</span> has the ability to special summon it's self from hand while you control a<span> Battlin Boxer</span> on the field, but you can not conduct your battle phase that turn. this effect makes this the best <span>Battlin Boxer</span> out right now. Even though you can't go in to your battle phase when your going first you can set up a nice bored with this card.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Battlin Boxer <span>Switchitter</span> <span> : <span>While not being no where near as good as <span>Sparrer</span>, <span>Switchitter</span> Can still be very use full. <span>Switchitter</span> has the effect that if you have a <span>Battlin Boxer</span> in the graveyard you can special summon it to your side of the field. This card paired up with Foolish Burial  can get you to your best card<span> Isolde</span>. (More About Her Later) Those are the 2 best <span>Battlin Boxer</span>, now on to important extenders </span></span></span></li>
 	<li><span><span>Blue Mountain Butterspy</span> : This Combo extender can help push you to make <span>Isolde</span>. Whit it's special summon effect from hand when you normal summon a warrior can make this the best extender if you don't open up  <span>Sparrer<span>. </span></span></span></li>
 	<li><span><span>Junk Forword <span>: The last crucial piece of the deck is none other than <span>Junk Forword<span>. This card is the first card you put on the field if you open it, why you might ask? It's effect states that is you have no monsters on your field special summon this card. That's it, that's why it's the best starter. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
 	<li><span>Isolde<span> : By far the best card in your deck. If you can make this card it's like drawing Exodia, YOU WIN. Nah, but on a real note this is the main card this card is the Heart And Soul of this deck, and it won't be a warrior deck without <span>Isolde<span>. This making this card Confirms that you can get<span> Borreload Savge Dragon</span> and <span>Trishula The Ice Barrier Dragon<span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
 	<li><span> Crystron Halqifibrax <span>: The most Annoying, Degenerate, Hated card in this current format is of course played in this deck. The Deck would not be any good without this card. It allows this deck to at least compare to some decks. Now that you know the Key Cards in this deck  it's tie for the combo. </span></span></li>

<p><span><span>Combo Time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make Isolde, (Any Way Doesn't Matter)</span> <span>Isolde Effect To Send 4 Equip Spells to Grave, And Special Summon Rose, Warrior Of Revenge. </span></span><span>Next Link Isolde Into Linkross And Summon 2 Tokens.

Not as combo-heavy as a normal hero deck (less vulnerable to nibiru). Adds a lot of power.

Always get two heroes out on turn 1.

No Vyon/Increase engine or Destiny Hero fusion engine because those prevent you from special summoning (Rainbow Neos- not classified as a HERO and light type)

RA and Neos (RA with support, Neos with minimal engine still being very strong)","Mound of the Bound Creator protects all of your LVL 10 monsters from card effects.

&nbsp;

Aside from RA cards, what is the easiest and most powerful LVL 10 available? Rainbow Neos.

&nbsp;

Terraforming/metaverse to search Mound (or mystic mine if you want to tech it in- stalling is in your deck's favour as Rainbow Neos generates huge card advantage).

Field barrier protects Mound.

&nbsp;

<hr />

&nbsp;

I will draw attention to the fact that i've used Jet Synchron / combo draw package, because it is more powerful than the alternatives/lets you draw 4 cards/produce Borreload for negates. This deck likes card advantage to set up Ra OTK's.

If you want to replace Jet Synchron, use Ra's acolyte and Keeper of Dragon Magic (to search Neo Fusion)

Side Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood for HP if you're struggling- you'll have hand advantage to pull it off + big RA attacks.

<hr />

Also Eygptian God slime + Mound + Field Barrier = Indestructable to both battle and card effects with protection on the field spell

&nbsp;

Phantom of chaos becomes very strong with Ra Sphere mode in the graveyard, as well as Rainbow Neos (allows phantom of chaos to return all enemy spells or monsters to deck). To ensure this effect goes off i'd run lightning storm (to bait negates) and card destruction to accelerate GY discards (jet synchron + barricade blocker also discard).

9 Dragon XYZ's backed up by two Blue-Eyes ultimate dragons.

The Kaiba experience","IMO the strongest possible deck using fusion and the Blue-Eyes package.

<hr />

Combos:

Summon maiden with eyes of blue, activate sage with eyes of blue -&gt; two blue eyes on the field (for an XYZ)

Dragon shrine-&gt; mill a dragon spirit of white (counts as a normal monster so you get another discard)

-&gt; Then mill either: white stone of legend (summon a blue-eyes in your END phase)

OR a Kidmodo dragon (skip your BATTLE phase but special summon a dragon from your hand).

<hr />

Future fusion:

Reveal ""Five-headed dragon"" to mill 5 different dragons (more dragons in your GY are preferred for Dragon Mirror, also lets you activate GY effects).

Dragon mirror should be used for a Blue-Eyes ultimate dragon based on situation (2 available):

-Alternative ultimate dragon: Lets you destroy 3 enemy cards if you used an alternative blue eyes as material

-Neo alternative ultimate dragon: Lets you attack 3 times with 4500 atk if this is the only card you control

<hr />

XYZ guide:

Nr 97 Draglubion can SS any of the other ""number"" monsters with 1 material (giving you two dragon XYZ monsters for the price of one). This is generally the best XYZ play. The best choice for each situation is:

-Nr 100: Numeron Dragon- Will have at least 9000 attack, and 8000 more if you have any XYZ dragons other than Nr 97 out. Pick this if enemy has allowed an OTK state.

-Nr 38: Hope Harbringer- Negate 1 spell/trap

-Nr 107: Galaxy-Eyes- Change all monsters to their original atk/def

-Nr C107- Tribute 2 monsters to be able to attack 3 enemy monsters (the least useful effect- 4500 atk beatstick)

The other XYZ dragons should be used situationally, eg ""Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis"" can be used to blow up backrow

NOTE: Thunder End Dragon can only use 2 normal dragons as material (must be Blue-Eyes white dragon)

<hr />

This deck can grind, using Deep-Eyes to remove enemy monsters and Dragon Spirit to banish spells/traps.

The overall power-level of this deck is tied to the power level of the fusion cards. If you want to take the focus away from fusion (and make this deck more competitive), cut future-fusion for imperm. This deck is not meta, but it is very consistent and fun to play."

1.) Chain for Bahamut Shark to activate it's effect and either special summon Number 71 to chain for Blackray Lancer or special summon Toadally.

2.) Keep Xyz summoning until you have 3 or 4 and link summon Infinitrack. Activate Infinitrack's effect and special summon 1 xyz from the GY once per turn. Infinitrack is also a really great beat stick.

&nbsp;

Note: If you want lots of Xyz monsters on the field special summon Xyz Remora. ;)"

Stromberg provides home for the warriors and is a 1 card Isolde while protecting them for battle. Able to,"With the falling of Linkross in OCG, it brings the Infernoble ceiling low and Stromberg provides a house for them. With both Quiet Life and Stromberg, it will be hard for opponent to break our Isolde Halq board. At the same time we also searched both BLS and Immortal Phoenix Gearfried as reinforcement because you are the king and they wont fail you.

The combo is simple, as it is just another Halq/Auroradon stuff. You just need Isolde, add Gearfried/BLS, ss Grappler Angler, make Halq, ss 001, make Auroradon, ss 001, make Arc Light (for early negation), use Auroradon tribute itself and 1 token, ss O-Lion, make Vanguard Roland and use its eff chain O-Lion, make Savage, add BLS at the end phase. You can even put them all at def position cus Stromberg is there to protect.

Stromberg is our best card and main starter, it means Glife and Terraforming are essential. Glife is also a great toolbox as it is a s/t pop and can be summoned from deck by Stromberg. Iron Hans and Knight as our main target, run 2 each as backup cus 3 are too bricky. Renaud is there as it is a plus with Living Fossil. 2 Fire Flint Lady as our best extender and it replaces Grappler Angler if we draw that tuner (Fire Flint Lady ss Grappler from hand and both have same lv1, means u wont need more equip if summoned from Isolde). Quiet Life goes along with Stromberg as floodgate (this deck doesnt run any normal summon anyway). 3 Durendal as advantage cards (you can put another good equips too, like Axe of Fools, etc.). Staples are just there cus f*** meta, man.

Extra deck is just combo pieces and generic links, play double/triple Isolde as follow up play (link climb). For side deck, Gamma is good as it kills S0 while giving us Halq or lv8 synchro.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/tEGjm1y.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Consistent combo, multiple negations, floodgate, staples, and great followup.

Cons: Stromberg banishes 10 (I tried playing 40+ cards but it makes Stromberg chance lower, but at least this deck can OTK)."

Zexal is not as dangerous to this deck, but it is still a threat, so this deck has many cards such as Imperm, ghost ogre and evenly matched to stop the zexal. With multifaker back at 3, altergeists actually might have a competitive chance again, and here it is. Playing tons of traps is essential for altergeists, so we have evenly matched and imperial order in the main deck. Altergeists are also another deck that can play pot of extravagance, so 3 of that as well. Imperm is obviously a must, and summon limit is in the side deck because it is so powerful. Artifact sanctum and scythe also made their way into the side deck, it is so stunning against utopic zexal and also a trap. Altergeists do a lot of summoning on the opponent's turn, so zexal isn't a massive threat but still extremely dangerous. Secret village of the spellcasters is a really good side deck card, especially against numeron. Selene is a good extender as well."

This will be your main problem, so having as many counters to zexal as possible is a must. Ghost ogre is extremely good to get rid of the zexal so you can go into accesscode and OTK next turn (Granted you're still alive). Zexal is extremely hard to play with, so cards like ash blossom and Infinite Impermanence really help against it. You'll also want plenty of rank 4s such as bagooska and abyss dweller to stun your opponent. Traptrix rafflesia stops handtraps, especially nibiru. You could consider running artifact sanctum and scythe, which stuns most decks, but in a salamangreat deck it really isn't necessary. Cards Like parallel eXceed are good for your rank 4 plays, and also extenders. Only 2 desires are necessary, it decreases your chance of drawing more than 1 and also removes any possible chance of you drawing 2 more desires of one. In the side the the lightning storm and evenly matched can help you immensly if you're playing against zexal. You can get rid of the zexal once it has been exhausted. Summon limit and gozen match are RIDICULOUSLY good in this format, especially against things like halqifibrax and other long combos. You are technically playing 8 gazelles in this deck, so no need to worry about not drawing one. Last but now least, 2 of the salamangreat traps are really useful. You can also search them with gazelle, but they're really good to see in your hand because they are just so disruptive."

Unfortunately, Frogs do not have enough cards to make their own deck. There was a bit of hope in the Create-A-Card Project, but as you probably know, that did not go so well. So, until Frogs get more good cards, we are going to have to stick with the Paleozoics.

Anyways, the focus of the Paleozoics is to slowly snowball advantage, disrupting your opponent in earlier turns and summoning them back from the GY as monsters later on in the duel. When they come back as monsters, they become level 2 aqua WATER monsters, who will be banished if they leave the field. This makes them a perfect mix with Frogs, having the right type, attribute, and level, as well as being Xyz focused, allowing them to not get banished when detached as material.

One of Frog's benefits is that they can mix into practically any WATER deck. For example, if you were to open the following:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> + Any WATER Monster = <strong>Coral Anemone</strong> + <strong>Toad</strong> + <strong>Dupe</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Pitch your WATER Monster to Special Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>
 	<li>Swap sends <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to the GY</li>
 	<li>Bounce <strong>Swap</strong> back to your hand</li>
 	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Swap</strong> sends <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> to the GY</li>
 	<li>Banish <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> from GY and Special Summon <strong>Ronin</strong></li>
 	<li>Link into <strong>Coral Anemone</strong></li>
 	<li>Use <strong>Coral Anemone's</strong> effect, Special Summon <strong>Swap</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Swap</strong> sends <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> to the GY</li>
 	<li>Banish <strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong> from GY and Special Summon <strong>Ronin</strong></li>
 	<li>Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></li>
 	<li>During the Opponent's Standby Phase, activate <strong>Toad's</strong> effect and Special Summon <strong>Dupe</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
One big flaw with Frogs is that they are weak. Their stats are too low to be taken as a threat, hence why they prefer going first, preventing your opponent from building their board. <strong>Dupe</strong> provides a solution for that. If you have 2 <strong>Dupe</strong> Frogs out, they will prevent your opponent from attacking altogether. Notice in the combo above, we never used <strong>Swap's</strong> final effect, which gives you an additional Normal Summon, as long as it is used for a Frog. If you open <strong>Swap</strong> + <strong>Dupe</strong> + Any WATER Monster, you will be able to end on <strong>Coral Anemone</strong> + <strong>Toad</strong> + 2 <strong>Dupes</strong>.

On an additional note, since the main deck does not have any WATER Monsters other than Frogs, we will always have an extra mill in the above combo. This means we can send an extra <strong>Ronin</strong> to the GY. <strong>Nibiru</strong> is a popular hand trap right now. But, just because a hand trap is good, doesn't mean everyone knows how to make the most of it. If your opponent plays <strong>Nibiru</strong> the moment you hit 5 summons, it would be at Step 9, right after you milled for the final time with <strong>Swap</strong>. Adjust the combo so that you have 2 <strong>Ronins</strong> and 1 Frog (<strong>Swap</strong>/<strong>Dupe</strong>). If your opponent plays <strong>Nibiru</strong> right there and then, you would 2 Frogs and 2 <strong>Ronins</strong> in the GY (and a <strong>Coral Anemone</strong>, but that doesn't matter here). Banish the 2 Frogs, Special Summon both <strong>Ronins</strong>, and overlay for a <strong>Toad</strong>. Note that if your opponent is smart, they would wait for Step 10, and then they would play the <strong>Nibiru</strong>. Nothing you can do about that.

As for <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>:
<ol>
 	<li>Set <strong>Scapegoat</strong> during your turn. To get around the restriction, you need to play it during your opponent's turn, preferably during the End Phase.</li>
 	<li>During your turn, use 2 of the tokens to summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></li>
 	<li>Use the other tokens to summon <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a></li>
 	<li>Use all 3 of the link monsters to summon either <strong>Borrelsword</strong> or <strong>Borreload</strong> (note that they will have <strong>I:P's</strong> protection)</li>
</ol>
All suggestions are welcome and appreciated."

&nbsp;

The best way to summon Rainbow Neos is through the Predaplant enginge (Scorpio to SS Cobra to search Neos Fusion). That way <strong>before</strong> you activate Neos Fusion (since Neos Fusion locks you out of SS for the remainder of the turn) you can either link them into Beat Cop from the Underworld to give Neos extra protection, overlay them into The Phantom Knights of Break Sword to destroy an opponents card (only useful if going second) or overlay them into Number 3: Cicada King for disruption.

Obviously none of that compares to playing the Numeron engine Turn 1 and then crushing your opponent from there.

&nbsp;

The Predaplant engine can also be used to search Instant Fusion to SS Thousand-Eyes Restrict to link all 3 into Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians. If there are 3 spells in the GYs or field you can then SS Thousand-Eyes Restrict from GY, link Restrict into Linkuriboh and link Selene and Linkuriboh into Accesscode Talker (or any other Link-4 that works). If you used the Numeron engine prior on your last turn you will have enough Spells for Selene's effect (Instant Fusion and Numeron Calling in GY and Numeron Network on field).

&nbsp;

Since Neos doesn't provide much interaction with your opponent the handtraps and floodgates will come in handy since There Can Be Only One doesn't stop you from summoning Rainbow Neos (it does prevent you from summoning more than 1 Numeron Gate and from using the Predaplant engine so keep that in mind)."

While zombies main weakness is reliance on resolving a normal summon in the form of Uni-Zombie, Shiranui Solitaire, or Gozuki. I believe the addition of a small Synchron package in the form of Tuning, Jet Synchron, and Quickdraw Synchron, as well as Crystron Halqifibrax all but remedy the renowned fragility of the zombie deck/ archetype. The typical end-board results in Zombie World, Artifact Dagda, Doomking Balerdroch (in the graveyard or on field,) and a Crystron Halqifibrax. On your opponent's turn you can activate Halqi's effect to tag out into a T.G. Wonder Magician, allowing you to destroy your own set scythe and special summon it, locking your opponent out of their extra deck. But wait! there's more! you can activate Wonder Magician's second effect allowing you to synchro on your opponent's turn using itself and Artifact Scythe into Shiranui Sunsaga, which represents an additional interruption in the form of a pop.

Here is a simple combo replay done on

Duelingbook: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=485913-20120302</a>

There are many ways that this combo can be achieved through a versatile and pretty consistent 3 card combo."

Full Combo is Ignister A.I.Land, Achichi @Ignister, and Pikari @Ignister. The extenders you draw into determine what plays you go with which include Balancer Lord, Micro Coder, Gatchiri @Ignister, and Doshin @Ignister. Your goal is to use A.I.Land to facilitate your plays to go into Dark Templar which summons 2 @Ignisters back from the grave when a monster is summoned to one of his arrows. The monster you want to summon here is Bururu @Ignister to one of Templar's zones so you can bring back Pikari and Achichi so that you can go into synchro and xyz plays. If you have further extenders like Succession or A.I.dle Reborn, you can go into Transcode and Fire Phoenix @Ignister. If this board survives, Link everything into Firewall Dragon Darkfluid and just straight-up destroy your opponent.

No you haven't since this deck is almost unplayable in a pure Chemical Strategy and has never seen the light of day unless you,"This Deck goes first. The strategy with this deck is to get VFD on the field along with either Laggia or Dolkka and if you open with the right hand, you can set up for a Bonding DHO to shotgun into Water Dragon Cluster on your opponent's turn. TLDR, monsters your opponent controls when cluster is summoned cannot activate their effects and their atk becomes 0. You can also use it to shotgun into 2 Water Dragons for a Quick Eff. You could Otk with just Cluster summon 2 Water Dragons, but he summons them in def so you have to also play thinks like All-Out Attacks or something to switch them to atk immediatedly. Water Dragon is a basically a level 8 vanilla that can float into 3 monsters when destroyed but you need to have the specific monsters in your gy to do so. It's floating eff doesn't require for it to be on the field and it doesn't miss timing so you caould destroy it with Bahrastos to get 4 bodies on the field. Water Dragon also makes all Fire and Pyro Monsters' atk become 0 but whos playing those kinds of monsters (probably pure dino but whatever)."

Works best going first, however prone to hand traps and negates. Makes use of Wonder Xyz and Triverr.","<strong>Aim of deck:</strong> Summon Triverr on Opponents turn using Wonder XYZ + 3 Tellarknigth monsters.

<strong>Strategy:</strong> If you think you are chosen one by the stars, then you should try this deck!

Shock your opponent with your CDS Xyz summoning skills and Summon a Winter Constellation on their turn, freezing your opponents cards and forcing them into refuge! Then discard their unlikely Mirror Force and shutdown their meta deck!! (*not always possible)

&nbsp;

<strong><em>-Explanation:</em></strong>

Worse than Kali Yuga and Archfiend, much less consistent, but fun to see what happens :P.

Consistency is about 1/4 or 25% (not taking into account hand traps/negates). A lot of draw power cards are needed to meet the conditions to summon Triverr on opponents turn. If you get a bad hand you can summon other xyz monsters. Overall, its just a deck in progress and i will apreciate any feedback or questions.

Weak to lock/handtraps/ any meta.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>Main Deck:</strong>

-Danger cards: lvl 4 for xyz, and draw power, can send juggler/ or tellarknigth monsters to GY for later revival

-Double summon, to make it easier to summon 3 tellar monsters as your hand will not always be great

- Pot of desires: - only 10 tellarknigths and you dont need most cards, so it works as draw engine

-Avarice/ Ancient Leaf/ Hand Destruction - draw

-Double or Nothing - helps against strong monsters

-Skybridge - can trick your opponent when baiting them - use  Deneb add Altair - chain this to OP effect and summon Vega, Vega summon Altair.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Extra:</strong></em>

-Dugares (Number 60): for draw power

-Bagosooka: Against locks

&nbsp;

<strong>Alternative Variants:</strong>

(not sure how these work bcoz never tried any, just ideas)

-tellar dragma artifacts

-tellar shadoll

-tellar, star seraph

- tellar synchro

Feel free to edit deck as you wish.

Then discard your other card to summon it and you can synchro. Alternatively if you have a level 2 monster on the field and scrap worm or golem in your graveyard already you can use recycler to get wyvern and get out scrap golem, and use it to summon the worm and synchro trishula. Sometimes you banish jet synchron, golem, or worm with pot of desires so your fallback is borrelsword and samurai destroyer or black rose dragon; real talk on a related note leanchoilia is underrated and makes it possible to win when you'd otherwise be sol, not to mention you can use it to recycle back jack and frogs for ronin summons.

Sometimes summoning trishula is not optimal, it's more like the icing on the cake, sometimes it's fantastic by itself but usually it's better when there's a cake already you feel me. Shrub serpent, solemn no card, and back jack package are for dealing with lightning storm and the like. if you have two shrub serpents out that get destroyed, I highly recommend you summon samurai destroyer and dupe frog, trust me on this one. My preference would be for witch's strike over shrub serpent or solemn judgement for sheer maximization of cheekiness and to punish everyone for using hand traps, but unfortunately it's bugged in ygo pro. Eria is in the side deck for when you have to deal with needlefiber or mermails. Extra deck space is tight what with all your toolbox responses, so the only knightmare is the unicorn because i had to cut compulsory evacuation device to make space for cards that don't target, since your biggest hang ups will be monsters with built in protection. It's also why quaking mirror force and evenly matched are in the side deck. Wind up snail is also in the side deck because it returns a set card to the hand, but also you can send it to the graveyard to special summon swap frog. Last but not least, if you draw both a frog and a recycler, hold onto one and use the other to bait out negations and such for smoother sailing turn two. You can throw your opponent for a lot of loops they wouldn't expect from your average paleofrog deck. If I could just play scraps and have a good time I wouldn't have had to work so hard on this."

Attempt to create maximum synergy and repetitive buffs between warrior and beast-warrior chaff with duplicate buffs and,"This deck is the first in a progressive series wherein we're opening 24 of every pack in chronological release order. 50 cards in Main deck. Some cards in extra deck, just because removing them would have been too much of an effort at 10:30 on a Wednesday. The strategy is simple, create maximum synergy with the cards given. Lots of low level warriors and beast-warriors that have more than a few duplicate buffs from the pack. These act as easily buffable fodder for the opening salvos, then eventually as fodder for some high level dragons that have their own buffs built into the deck."
