This strategy aims to restrict absolutely everything which the opponent does, until their deck is empty of any useful resources, such that they can't assemble any real wincon. During the 20-30 turns it takes to achieve this, we accrue advantage very slowly with slight +1s, namely with the deck's primary draw engine, Dark Factory of More Production. By turn 20, you should have 3-4 negates on board (usually handtraps, searched by Sangan), a full grip of 6 cards in hand, and your opponent should have less than 4 cards in their combined hand/field. This means that there is no possible move for them to win the game. There are a number of ways to reduce the opponent's LP to zero, but at this point, you've already won. Generally, the final wincon (on turn 30+) is Topologic Gumblar Drago, which can lock the opponent out of drawing any cards, once they have 0 cards on field."

Build a board , support it with spells/traps , chip your opponents health , or otk them.  Feels a bit like old-school since there is actual interaction between you and your opponent.  A couple of games should give you a general idea of how the deck plays.  It utilizes the Utopia Double OTK mechanic , which is very amusing to pull off , as well as 3x Super Poly in order to disrupt your opponent.  The Magical Musket cards offer some great utility , and if you manage to get Doc out early , you should be able to keep recycling them.  Keep in mind, the column utility of the Musketeers , which will restrict your opponents zone usage , or at least they will force them to provide you some advantage.  I do believe this deck is viable in competitive play, and i will continue to tune it as time goes by.  The side deck as well as some fusion monsters in the extra deck will be replaced when i find something better , since i feel there is room for improvement  Also, the 3x Ash Blossoms could be replaced by any handtrap as well as Called by the Grave.  I am split about the usage of Pot of desires / Pot of extravagance in this deck , and although i use (at least desires) in 99% of my decks , I had better success without it , than with it. Still , there is a chance i will run 2-3 of desires in the future.  I am really open to any suggestions that you think will make the deck better , and will be sure to try them.  *I have tried the 3x Foolish burial goods + 1x Metalfoes Fusion , but the games that i started with Met. Fusion + Double or nothing , felt real bad, so i cut it out."

Current ideas: -Maindeck compulsory evacuation device, cosmic cyclones, or heavy storm duster. -Replacing ghost ogres with phantazmays or any of the above. -Trying set rotation/metaverse with necrovalley or mystic mine for additional stun options"

Use Fog Counters while evading damage and protecting yourself from all","Bringing the Cloudians back! The main strategy is to use The Sanctuary in the Sky to reduce your battle damage from Cloudians to zero, while their effect keeps them all from being destroyed by battle. All the Cloudians can work together to build up Fog Counters pretty quickly and take control of the board. Turbulence is good for bringing out Smoke Ball into free Link plays. Archlord Kristya is also a relatively easy summon, since Turbulence gives pretty good control over the number of Fairy Types in the Graveyard, and summoning Kristya at the right time just makes for an easier lock-down. It's a pretty fun deck, not meant for pro tournaments, but it can take home some surprise wins at locals. To make the deck more competitive, I would cycle out some of the weaker cards for hand traps, but I just prefer to keep my decks as pure to the archetype as possible.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

When Electrumite is summoned, activate its eff to send any lvl 8 D/D/D ( for this example we'll use Ragnarok) to the extra deck.</li>  	<li> With the effect of the dark contract, search our Savant Thomas from the deck and add it to the hand and put Thomas into a pendulum scale, at the same time activating his eff to grab Keplar from the extra deck to the hand.</li>  	<li>With Electrumite's 2nd eff, pop Thomas from the scales and send him to the extra deck, then add Curtain Raiser from the extra deck to the hand. (Don't forget to draw a card due to Electrumite.)</li>  	<li>Next, put Curtain Raiser and Keplar form your hand, to the pendulum zones and perform a pendulum summon (you can only pendulum summon D/D's at this point of time), summoning Ragnarok and Thomas form the extra deck.</li>  	<li>Thomas monster eff activates to pop Keplar in the scales to bring out a lvl 8 D/D/D monster. In this example, I'll use/special summon from the deck, Doom King Armageddon.</li>  	<li>Xyz using Armageddon, Thomas, and Ragnarok to summon out Coach King Trainer. Then activate Coach King's effect 3 times this turn. After the eff has resolved, you should have 7 cards in your hand that you can make plays with depending on what combo pieces you have.</li>  	<li>Use Coach King and Electumite as link materials to link summon Zefra Metaltron. (Curtain Raiser is still in a scale and Dark Contract with the Gate should still be on the field at this point, as long as they're not removed from the field by an opponents eff. As well as having 3 level 8 D/D monsters in the grave).</li> </ol> This is the basic combo of the deck, but to demonstrate an example if you had some combo pieces in your 7 card hand, this is what combos you can pull off.  7 Card Hand Combos: 5/7-&gt;(Any other Card)        1/7-&gt; Swirl Slime       1/7-&gt; Necro Slime         Combo <ol>  	<li>Use Eff of Swirl Slime to send itself and necro slime to the graveyard and fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Ghengis (lvl6) from the extra deck.</li>  	<li>Using Necro Slime and one of the lvl 8 D/D monsters in your graveyard that's NOT RAGNAROK, activate necro slimes eff to special summon yet another D/D/D Flame King Ghenghis (lvl6) form the extra deck.</li>  	<li> 1st Ghenghis eff activates to special summon Ragnarok from the grave.</li>  	<li>Ragnarok eff activates to special summon the 3rd lvl 8 D/D monster in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Overlay the two level 8's to make Hope Harbinger and the two Ghengis' for High King  Caesar.</li> </ol> -Depending on if you have more combo pieces in your hand, you may extend this combo. (darkwurm, vice typhoon, swamp king, etc).  7 Card Hand Combos: 4/7-&gt;(Any other Card)        1/7-&gt; Swirl Slime       1/7-&gt; Necro Slime        1/7-&gt; Lamia         Combo <ol>  	<li>Use Eff of Swirl Slime to send itself and necro slime to the graveyard and fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Ghengis (lvl6) from the extra deck.</li>  	<li>Swirl Slime Eff activates to special summon Lamia from the hand. In turn, activates Ghenghis' eff to special summon Ragnarok from the grave. Ragnarok's eff activates to special summon a lvl 8 D/D from the grave.</li>  	<li>Overlay Ragnarok with the lvl 8 D/D to make Hope Harbinger.</li>  	<li> Then, Synchro summon using lamia and Ghenghis to make Gust King Alexander.</li>  	<li> Using Necro Slime's eff in the graveyard, banish necro slime and for this example, I'll be banishing the Ghenghis, which we used to sync Alexander. Bringing out Oracle King D'arc. when D'arc is summoned, Alexander eff activates to special summon Lamia from the grave.</li>  	<li>From here we can use Alexander and Lamia to Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon (you can use Crystal Wing here too, but I prefer Savage Dragon) If you do summon Savage Dragon, its eff activates, putting Electrumite in the Spell and Trap zone for its Borreload counters.</li>  	<li>Remember that we still have a dark contract of the gate if it wasn't tampered by the opponent. We'll destroy it to activate Lamia's eff to special summon her from the grave.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon using D'arc and Lamia to summon Siegfried.</li> </ol> -Depending on if you have more combo pieces in your hand, you may extend this combo. (darkwurm, vice typhoon, swamp king, etc).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck is extremely explosive and can just continuously break through your opponent's negates and then using <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> to attack for game. The goal of this deck is to go second and OTK your opponent. You always have multiple options and many resources when it comes to your hand and making your field going second. <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is a one card engine to bait out 2 of your opponent's interruptions. You also have cards like Farfa that remove your problems from your opponent's field, allowing you to kill them. Droll &amp; Lock Bird is my choice of handtrap for this deck because stopping your opponent's turn is important so you can kill them next turn, a card like Ash Blossom stops their card permanently whereas Droll is a temporary solution, but a permanent solution only slows them down, doesn't stop their turn completely most of the time whereas Droll does. Lastly, <a data-name=""Junk Forward"">Junk Forward</a> is a nice tech I really like because it's a free special summon and it's level 3 and is earth so it contributes to Block Dragon. I hope you guys enjoy playing this deck as I have! It's pretty consistent and of course I built it from scratch like I do all my other decks for you guys."

Made for fun/casual/semi-competitive play.","This is my personal Felgrand Deck. Felgrand Dragon has been my favorite card, ever since it came out. I wanted to make a fun/casual deck, but geared to win. Strategy is to try and fill the field with strong dragons. The deck list is made of cards I personally own, and is mostly a budget deck (I'm not dropping 40+$ on a saryuja, no matter how much i want one). Any comments or advice is welcome and may be considered when I post an improved version of this deck.  The deck is not complicated, utilizes cards like dragon ravine and dragon shrine to send dragons to the grave, then return of the dragon lords and dragon knight of creation to bring them out. utilizes the basic felgrand engine with paladin of felgrand to search specific dragons.  Trade-in can help drop dragons into the grave, while helping to prevent brick hands. Upstart goblin is there for the 39 card deck. Dux and Phalanx ensure a quick synchro climb to get to crystal wing synchro dragon quickly, as well as provide fodder for using tempest, dragon ruler of storms' abilities. Red-eyes darkness metal dragon is self-explanatory, but i'm thinking of switching him out.  For utility dragons, amorphage goliath helps to stop extra deck plays from my opponents, since the dragons can beat over most things on their own. Dragon spirit of white helps use dragon shrines ability, (normal in the graveyard) to stockpile dragons, and can add a bit of removal to the deck.  Lastly, effect veiler is a cheap hand trap that targets monster effects. I don't really have any other hand traps.  The current ideal field for this deck to have is a link monster in the extra zone (lanphornychus, galaxy-eyes solflare dragon, decode talker) then summon crystal wing synchro dragon to lock down monster effects and number 38: hope harbinger dragon titanic galaxy can stop a spell per turn. Decode talker works a bit better than the other two, for the extra 1000 attack with the double link. Lanphornychus is simplest, a toolbox link 2, but i would prefer using galaxy-eyes solflare dragon for the higher attack. the price of losing one monster with 2000 attack or more isn't too steep a price in this deck.  In the side deck I have sangan and phantom skyblaster, for searching and swarming abilities, super polymerization to screw up the opponents plays and for a reason to run Starving Venom, 2 of Dogoran, the mad flame kaiju, 1 pankratops, 1 darkest diabolos, and 1 extra amorphage goliath. Also, a burst breath and royal decree for traps.  If there are any comments or advice you may have for my deck, please don't hesitate to share. I would love any advice that could help run the deck.

End Board: Hieratic Seal which floats into <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a> to search <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, Elpy, and Phantazmay.  &nbsp;  These are not the only possible combos, however. For example, you can search out WL Guardragon by linking into <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star"">Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star</a>, or by banishing a <a data-name=""World Chalice - &quot;World Legacy&quot;"">World Chalice - ""World Legacy""</a> from your graveyard. Without extenders, you can still summon out big monsters like Berserker and Phantazmay, or set up for a devastating Levianeer next turn. Each hand has new possibilities to extend the board even further.  &nbsp; <h2>Future Support:</h2> This deck has the potential to benefit from any new set, from getting new link monsters to extend combos and to finding more ways to go into Ib.  The deck also receives some support from CHIM, in the form of <a data-name=""Galaxy Satellite Dragon"">Galaxy Satellite Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>. Galaxy Satellite Dragon is the reason I play White Rose Dragon, as it allows for summoning it to put WL Guardragon on the top of my deck for next turn. While weaker than other lines of play, it adds consistency to the combos above. Striker Dragon is the bigger inclusion, allowing the deck to play through disruption of WL Guardragon to summon a 3-mat Apoullousa, Bow of the Goddess, while also enabling an opening of 1 normal dragon and 2 Mekk-Knights to make Morning Star. I have also previously tested <a data-name=""Bulge, the Spiral Dragon"">Bulge, the Spiral Dragon</a>, but found that it took too much investment to create an inferior board (<a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a> + 1 Rank 8), and <a data-name=""Seyfert, the Starliege Dragon"">Seyfert, the Starliege Dragon</a>, who lacks a level 1 dragon monsters that summons itself at will, while also not having many targets for its grave effect.  &nbsp; <h2>Other Key Cards:</h2> Spell/Trap Removal: Allows me to play the game.  <a data-name=""Card of Safe Return"">Card of Safe Return</a>: A true MVP, a regular combo will resurrect from the graveyard at least 3 times, netting massive card advantage.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>: Dumps Carboneddon, WC Guardragon, World Chalice - ""World Legacy"", normals, etc. What's not to love?  <a data-name=""Carboneddon"">Carboneddon</a>: Not only does it allow for the Oviraptor combo, but it also functions as a great card in a pinch, as it can summon Wattaildragon to make high-level Synchros, or the low level normals to make links.  &nbsp;  Well, that's it for the deck. I will update this every time a new set comes out or I find something new. <a>You can join the Trinity Discord Server here for the latest news and updates for Trinity!</a>  If you have any questions about the deck, feel free to leave them in the comments or message me in the discord."

Additionally you can also:  - Tribute your own or your opponents (via Lair of Darkness) high level monsters to for several effects (for example Ring of Destruction or a Virus card). Then, if you used your own Red-Eyes monster, you can easily bring it back with Call of the Haunted, Monster Reborn or Spirit.  - Use The Fang of Critius to summon Fusion monsters with cool effects.  - Use Ring of Defense for Blazing Mirror Force or Ring of Destruction.  The Lair-of-Darkness-engine has great synergy with the Red-Eyes-engine since you can use Ahrima to get a Red-Eyes Black Dragon or Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon to your hand and since you're gonna keep re-summoning Red-Eyes monsters, you can easily summon Darkest Diabolos (by his own effect) from the graveyard."

These are all cards he has never used in the anime (but they did see play by the King of Games in some movies).  Some cards are more obvious then others (such as the Magnet warriors, Gadgets or Magicians) and some cards are a little bit more farfetched, but when you think about they do make sense. <em>Some examples:</em>  <strong>Blazing Mirror Force</strong> = Magic Cylinder (cuz' of the burn damage, still looking for a better option)  <strong>Drowning Mirror Force</strong> = 'Original' Mirror Force  <strong>Chain Hole</strong> = Chain Destruction  <strong>Heavy Storm Duster</strong> = Dust Tornado  <strong>Snatch Steal</strong> = Change of Heart  <strong>Raigeki</strong> = Dark Hole  <strong>Soul Charge</strong> = Monster Reborn  <strong>Dark Magic Veil</strong> = Dark Magic Curtain  &nbsp;  And lets be honest, don't you just love the old monsters from the Duel Monsters-era?  Cards like Gaia the Fierce Knight, Curse of Dragon, Celtic Guardian and Giant Soldier of Stone all got improved with card effects.  This deck is still in working progress, so please let me know if you see some improvements!  :)"
