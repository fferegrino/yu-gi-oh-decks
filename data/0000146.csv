The whole point in this deck is to get out 3 negates and possibly a disruption. Only down side is no ""monster reborn"" or ""pot of aiverice"" during that time (April 11, 2016 banlist/format)/ With a multitude of combo-lines, adaptability, consistency, and low investments for high rewards; synchrons are full of fair yet broken plays and boards that (for the time) was really hard to out. Making a Quasar and maybe even another piece of interaction, to outright mind gaming your opponent with 1 hand trap (Maxx ""C"") made some games not even last past turn 1. This deck is my personal build I played with for my locals in my area at the time. I was considered a degenerate player for summoning 4 negates at one point. In this deck, you will find a somewhat irregular choice of main deck, extra and even side which was crafted to take on what I was dueling against on a regular basis where I was. Over all, this is a casual deck, that loves negations and hates being graveyard locked. Your game-plan is a tad linear with almost all your combos starting the same exact way and is easily telegraphed. In modern time, this deck would need to chew through multi-negates, disruptions and even possibly a Nibiru. This deck is not to be taken overly seriously, but on a casual level with friends, could fetch you a game or two."

This is a total casual build (<a data-name=""Spellbook of Judgment"">Spellbook of Judgment</a> is banned for a reason), made for fun and intent to use for fun, I’m not responsible for any friendship lost by this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Witchcrafter,  Artificers of magic!!</i></b></span>  <span>The Witchcrafter archetype is adorable in all artwork that is presented, linking the lore of the spellcaster universe ( Endymion, Spellbook, Invokeds), making a third force to  balance power between them. They don't store knowledge like  Prophecy-Spellbook or  use knowledge for power and war like Endymion, instead they use for  (like the name says) craft magic artefacts  that which one of the Witchcrafter are responsible for one process (pottery , glass, jewelry, etc).

Their primary goal is to use their banishing effects combined with zombies inherent graveyard synergy to OTK the opponent. This Variant opts to go second to take advantage of shiranui’s OTK playstyle and use powerful cards such as <a data-name=""Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story"">Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story</a> and the new <a data-name=""Laval Salamander"">Laval Salamander</a>. The deck also uses A small Shaddoll engine as a method to send cards such as <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>, <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>, or a Shiranui combo piece to grave.  <strong>Extenders</strong>  General Advice for playing the deck can be given as follows: Make <a data-name=""Lavalval Salamander"">Lavalval Salamander</a> as often as possible ass he is both the decks best extender and functions as removal. Hold the effects that lock you into summoning only zombies until as late into the combo as possible (ie: <a data-name=""Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story"">Ghost Meets Girl – A Shiranui’s Story</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword Shade"">Shiranui Spectralsword Shade</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Squire"">Shiranui Squire</a>).  <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> is an extra spell that lets you set up combos and give your cards protection. By sending <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a> and <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a> to grave you can summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> which can convert a spell resolving to a free monster negate and draw with an extender in grave.  The most basic Shiranui Play is to summon <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a>, Tribute Solitare, summon <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a> use <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a> to send<a data-name=""Mezuki""> Mezuki</a> to the graveyard banish <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a> from the graveyard to summon back <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> from the grave. Then use the two monsters to make a level 8 or 7 synchro. This is the core combo for a lot of other Shiranui combos and this combo is used in ost zombie decks.  <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> provides an additional special summon to get out more shiranui’s on board, but more importantly it provides a banishing outlet for what ever you special summon using its effect. For example, if you summon <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> off of <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster’s"">Shiranui Spiritmaster’s</a> effect you can perform the basic <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a> combo tributing <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> instead to have <a data-name=""Shiranui Solitare"">Shiranui Solitare</a>’s when banished effect live for later.  <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> is one of the best combo extenders. He can be sent off of <a data-name=""Uni-zombie"">Uni-zombie</a> to banish a zombie in grave to summon a zombie in hand, while also functioning as a Uni-zombie on field.  <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectral Shade"">Shiranui Spectral Shade</a> is a final extender as it locks you into zombies but provides insane recursion.  Fun to note <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus </a>triggers any Shiranui’s banish effect. It can be a destroy one, Summon a banished or a draw one discard one.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  73.57% chance to open at least one handtrap.  82.00% for at least one starter and extender  ~93.54% chance for at least one starter  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  The relevant Shiranui Package consists of <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>,<a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga""> Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>, <a data-name=""Shiranui Squiresaga"">Shiranui Squiresaga</a>, and last and least<a data-name=""Shiranui Samuraisaga""> Shiranui Samuraisaga</a>. <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> and <a data-name=""Shiranui Squiresaga"">Shiranui Squiresaga</a> are the two main OTK Enablers and extenders, both banish a card to gain attack. <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>, lets you reset your banished or in grave zombie synchro monsters for some removal while grandting protection. <a data-name=""Shiranui Samuaisaga"">Shiranui Samuaisaga</a> is only run as a target for <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword"">Shiranui Spectralsword</a>, its not good and should only be used as a forced steppingstone. This package lets the player grind out games as the Shiranui engine loops itself very well.  <a data-name=""Lavalval Salamander"">Lavalval Salamander</a> is insane Shiranui support and you can’t convince me otherwise. He draws you two cards and then puts two in grave. He banishes your Shiranui monsters in grave for removal.  The other synchro monsters and XYZ monsters are situational tools. <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is for spell and trap removal. <a data-name=""Psy-framelord Omega"">Psy-framelord Omega</a> is crazy in grindy games. <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir"">Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</a> is a backup plan for going first. Lastly, <a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragon"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragon</a> is a great pressure tool for decks that struggle with non-destruction removal.  The zombie link package is mostly for extending off of cards such as <a data-name=""Shiranui Spectralsword Shade"">Shiranui Spectralsword Shade</a> and <a data-name=""Shiranui Squire"">Shiranui Squire</a>. Its also generic link value for zombies. The Shaddoll extra deck package just covers all the possible options for what you could need. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> is the recommended choice.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>  <strong>            </strong>Ironically the side deck is mostly used for going first. <a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash</a> is an insane stuttered pop 3 that can mess with your opponent’s timings. By destroying two then banishing <a data-name=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a> to pop another, your opponent can be left at severe disadvantage. <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a> helps get <a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash</a><a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash""> out but can also get </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><a data-name=""Shiranui Style Swallow’s Slash"">.</a> <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> and <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> might seem counter intuitive but if they are used after you set up going first they have little effect on you compared to the dramatic stun effect they have on the opponent. <a data-name=""Psy-framelord Omega"">Psy-framelord Omega</a> is crazy here. <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> works similarly.  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> helps control combo decks. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> stops Trap decks. <a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duste"">Harpies Feather Duste</a>r helps stop backrow deck. <a data-name=""Called by the Grav"">Called by the Grav</a>e helps stop handtraps going first.  &nbsp;"

The deck functionally goes first since <strong>Stardust</strong> has many options to put up negates nowadays. You can get a pretty good endboard with a two card combo of just <strong>Junk Converter</strong> and <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong>. But you will get more out of it if you have <strong>Doppelwarrior </strong>as well.  Main Deck includes 3 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>, 3 <strong>Quickdraw Synchron</strong>, 3 <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong>, 1 <strong>Stardust Trail</strong>, 3 <strong>Junk Synchron</strong>, 3<strong> Junk Converter</strong>, 3 <strong>Doppelwarrior</strong>, 1 <strong>Stardust Xiaolong</strong>, and 1 <strong>Wish-Converging Dragon</strong>. <strong>Quickdraw Synchron</strong> is just <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and I guess you can use it as a target for <strong>Shooting Riser Dragon</strong> if you decide to play things like <strong>Shooting Star Dragon</strong>, <strong>Stardust Warrior</strong>, or <strong>Satellite Warrior</strong>. <strong>Stardust Synchron</strong> is a level 4 <strong>Synchron</strong> tuner which is very good already and it searches basically most of your much needed Spells/Traps, but its sad that it doesn't search <strong>Synchro Chase</strong> but that is understandable. If you discard it off of <strong>Converter</strong>, its essentially a free extender from grave.<strong> Stardust Trail</strong> is a decent card since it is a level 4 extender, but its the primary target for <strong>Stardust Illuminate</strong> other than <strong>Xiaolong</strong>. <strong>Junk Synchron</strong> is bonkers of course. <strong>Junk Converter</strong> is grave set-up, a searcher, and it gives you an extender. <strong>Doppelwarrior</strong> is just here since it makes tokens. <strong>Xiaolong</strong> is another<strong> Illuminate</strong> target. <strong>Wish-Converging Dragon</strong> gets you to <strong>Majestic Star</strong> and <strong>Shooting Majestic Star</strong>.  Spells and Traps aren't surprising. 3 <strong>Tuning</strong>. 3 <strong>Stardust Illuminate</strong> which is a <strong>Foolish</strong> and level modulation. 3 <strong>Synchro Chase</strong> since it makes sure your effects go through. 1 <strong>ROTA</strong>. 1 <strong>Reborn</strong>. 3 <strong>Arriving Miracle</strong> which is just to get you to your <strong>Majestic</strong> monsters. 1 <strong>Called By</strong> since every play in this deck is just asking to be handtrapped. 2 <strong>TTT</strong> for the same reason. 1 <strong>Black Garden </strong>to either go with <strong>Garden Rose Maiden</strong> or <strong>Garden Rose Flora</strong>. Finally, 1 <strong>Majestic Mirage</strong> since it essentially makes your <strong>Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</strong>'s 1 negate into 3 interruptions.  Extra Deck. 1 <strong>Ultimaya Tzolkin</strong> since it brings out either <strong>Moonlight</strong> or <strong>Crystal Wing</strong>. 2 <strong>Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</strong> which is an interruption going first and your OTK enabler going second. 1<strong> Blood Rose Dragon</strong> since its a thing going second or you can take something like 1 of your <strong>Junk Speeder</strong>s out and replace it with a normal <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> to use <strong>Blood Rose</strong>'s second effect as another form of disruption probably. 1 <strong>Majestic Star Dragon</strong> which is just insane and it doesn't need to return to the ED if you have <strong>Arriving Miracle</strong> face-up. 1 <strong>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</strong> and 1 <strong>Blackrose Moonlight Dragon</strong> as <strong>Tzolkin targets</strong>. 1 of the original <strong>Stardust Dragon</strong> and 1 <strong>Stardust Spark Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Stardust Charge Warrior</strong>. 1 <strong>T.G. Hyper Librarian</strong>. 2 <strong>Junk Speeder</strong>. 1 <strong>Garden Rose Flora</strong> which is just <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and a thing for <strong>Blood Rose</strong>, but you can switch it for <strong>Accel Synchron</strong> if you value the level modulation. Finally, 1 <strong>Garden Rose Maiden</strong> which is more <strong>Tzolkin</strong> fodder and it revives a Dragon Synchro from grave. It also searches <strong>Black Garden</strong> which can be used as an extender of sorts.  Side Deck is meh. 2 <strong>Nibiru</strong>. 3 <strong>Belle</strong>. 3 <strong>Majestic Absorption</strong> which is really only here for the equip effect going second. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 2 <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>. 2 <strong>Starlight Road</strong> because its a<strong> Stardust</strong> deck so why not."

However by itself it does much less, and also you have to hard draw more pieces of the majestic support to get that combo going  Dragon link is not really using the support so I don't like it.  Different speeder, in my opinion might be the better way to approach it. The goal of my deck is end on a few monsters that interupt your opponent but come back after their turn so that you can reccur advantage. Different speeder focuses much more on turboing negates to the field and opressing your opponent so they can't even put you behind. Those decks generally use <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a>, <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>, etc. You can add some of those elements to this deck by adding <a data-name=""Quickdraw Synchron"">Quickdraw Synchron, tzolkin, and abyss, and probably take out </a><a data-name=""Double Star Shaman"">Double Star Shaman</a> and <a data-name=""Cosmic Blazar Dragon"">Cosmic Blazar Dragon.</a>  But without further ado, my approach. Buckle up, it's a long ride.  There are several branches, so I will talk about the main combos the deck has.  First of all the keystone of the deck, <a data-name=""Junk Speeder"">Junk Speeder</a>.  The easiest way to summon it is with <a data-name=""Junk Synchron "">Junk Synchron and a lv 2 in grave (setup by </a><a data-name=""Junk Converter"">Junk Converter</a><a data-name=""Junk Synchron "">) or sometimes </a><a data-name=""Synchron Carrier"">Synchron Carrier + Junk Synchron or Synchron Carrier + </a><a data-name=""Cyberse Synchron"">Cyberse Synchron (cyberse synchron effect on carrier)</a>  I will cover the other easiest way to setup the first lv 2 in grave later.  &nbsp;  NOTE: Always have a monster in the EMZ if you can, it saves space  But essentially with speeder you summon every card you can (Cyberse, <a data-name=""Satellite Synchron"">Satellite Synchron</a>, Junk, Stardust)  And then <a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">Stardust Synchron can get its search based on what is in your hand right now (In order of importance you search </a><a data-name=""Arriving Miracle"">Arriving Miracle, </a><a data-name=""Majestic Mirage"">Majestic Mirage, </a><a data-name=""Stardust Illuminate"">Stardust Illuminate</a><a data-name=""Majestic Mirage"">, </a><a data-name=""Majestic Absorption"">Majestic Absorption</a><a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">) - only search absorption if you need to out a card or are going for game</a>  &nbsp;  Assuming you have nothing good in hand, stardust synchron searches arriving  Activate the arriving and stack <a data-name=""wish-converging dragon"">wish-converging dragon</a>  Next, synchro summon <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon with Junk speeder, stardust synchron, satellite, and cyberse (5+4+2+1=12)</a>  Arriving draws a card, special summoning wish-converging who can special summon <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a>  Upon special summoning, Brotaur uses its effect to discard a card, targeting wish converging, add <a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail </a>  Use stardust synchron in grave to tribute junk synchron  Use trail in hand to special itself  Synchro <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> with trail and stardust synchron  Trail summons a token here  Summon <a data-name=""Shooting Majestic Star Dragon"">Shooting Majestic Star Dragon using the token, brotaur, wish-converging, and stardust</a>  &nbsp;  Thus your end board is 1 negate and 1 board wipe  &nbsp;  Now how does this get better?  Firstly if you used converter for the setup and used illuminate already to send trail to the graveyard  Converter can special summon junk synchron from the grave after you summon junk speeder  When your field consists of Red Supernova Dragon, Stardust Dragon, token, wish-converging, brotaur, and junk synchron (extra from converter)  Banish illuminate from grave to increase stardust dragon's lv by 1  Summon shooting majestic with Stardust, token, wish-converging  Summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light with brotaur and junk synchron</a>  Now we got 2 negates and a board wipe!  Note: If you didn't use illuminate, instead of banishing illuminate, continue with the combo as normal, but instead of shooting majestic star, summon normal <a data-name=""Majestic Star Dragon"">Majestic Star Dragon using the token, stardust dragon, and wish converging, then you can summon herald with brotaur and junk synchron</a>  &nbsp;  Now time for that other way to setup the lv 2  The obvious sore thumb in this decklist is <a data-name=""petite dragon"">petite dragon</a> right?  Now comes its use, if you opened junk synchron + <a data-name=""dragon shrine"">dragon shrine you can do the same as the non illuminate variation of the above combo by</a>  Activating <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine  (send petite dragon first, </a><a data-name=""guardragon promineses"">guardragon promineses second</a><a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">)</a>  Normal summon junk synchron, special petite dragon  Summon speeder with the two cards  Speeder chain link 1, Guardragon chainlink 2  Summon all the tuners from deck (search arriving)  Use arriving to stack wish-converging  Summon supernova with stardust synchron, satellite, speeder, cyberse  Draw with arriving (use wish-converging to summon brotaur, use brotaur on wish-converging to search trail)  Stardust Synchron tributes guardragon  Trail specials from hand  Summon stardust dragon with trail and stardust synchron (trail summons a token)  Summon normal majestic star with Stardust, token, wish-converging  Summon herald with junk synchron and broataur  (Once again, having used illuminate means you can increase stardust dragon's level by 1 and can summon shooting majestic instaed of normal majestic)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Of course if you really want to have the shooting majestic, you can summon it with stardust, token, brotaur, and wish-converging instead of having normal majestic star + herald  &nbsp;  I think I should note incase someone doesnt know, Majestic Mirrage lets normal majestic star and shooting majestic star not be once per turn, so it is really good with shooting majestic because it keeps on coming back, but normal majestic star tributes itself permenantly, so after negating once you have to decide if it is worth negating and giving it up permanently  &nbsp;  There are many other paths this deck can go down but those are the main things you should keep lines you should keep in mind  HALP I GOT HANDTRAPPED:  Bait out hand traps with your searchers  Hope you have <a data-name=""crossout designator"">crossout designator, also add the handtraps you are scared of, I only have ash</a>  Also, if they stop speeder, you can still do the shooting majestic star combo by tributing speeder for stardust synchron and using trail  However, converter can chainblock for speeder to help protect from ash  Veiler/Imperm on Junk Synchron or Junk Speeder can be cirucmvented with the majestic combo  If you made Speeder with converter and they veiler/imperm speeder, converter summoning back junk synchron lets you go into crystal wing  &nbsp;  Why are you playing 43 cards git good:  I really should, once again this deck is a wip and I haven't decided which 3 cards to cut  &nbsp;  Why is your side deck so weird:  These are just cards I considered playing, not an actual side deck, put in cards you feel  are necessary  &nbsp;  Where is doppelwarrior:  If you are playing the other speeder variant it is probably more needed, but for me it was more of a brick. Whenever I could use its effect it didn't improve my end board by that much.  &nbsp;  Why is the extra bad:  I started with the base of a synchro deck I had from before jet synchro was banned, so it had some combos based on that. The cards in the extra I would recommend replacing if you want to change stuff up are:  Double star shaman  Martial Metal Marcher  T.G. Hyper Librarian ?  Stardust charge warrior  Satellite warrior  Cosmic Blazar Dragon  (That's a worryingly large amount of carsd in retrospect)  &nbsp;  Please let me know if you have any comments, any advice is appreciated!"

Just as good going second as it is going first. ,"Open Fraktall for Simorgh Lock. Use your other 4 cards to make linkuriboh or double dragon lord to protect the barrier statue. You can often also get out Abyss Dweller to make the first turn lock stronger Everything else is free value. You can often play through 3 interruptions (say Ash, Imperm, and Ghost Belle). If you lock your opponent out first turn with barrier statue, you should be able to do lethal if not close to it by the following turn. There are a lot of moving pieces with some interesting chain blocks so the interactions are interesting and the deck's grind game is very good.  One of the best parts is the revolt, which I think is extremely underrated. Use it to bring back nervall, kit, and any of the lower links (usually at least Ferrjit) to link summon Shuraig. This lets you non-target banish, search a tri-brigade, send a tri-brigade, and cycle a card in hand, all off of 1 card. If that doesn't sound too good, note that this comes up very often."

(Dupe frog can ""miss the timing,"" making some effects not allow Dupe Frog to activate at all.)  -Toadally Awesome is at 3 now. You don't have to bounce Toadally back to the Extra Deck after it leaves the field *every* time anymore. Try bouncing Swap Frog back when Toadally Awesome leaves to load your graveyard up with Ronintoadins and Frogs, which you can use to summon more Toadally Awesome's  -Use Sea Lancer to bring your banished frogs back to the field as equip spells. Link summon something using Sea Lancer as material to return these frogs to the graveyard, where Ronintoadin can banish them to special summon itself repeatedly.  -Avoid banishing Swap Frog from your graveyard for Ronintoadin's effect without either a Sea Lancer in your hand to return monsters to your graveyard from the banish zone or unless you really need a frog on the field.  -Transmodify will let you get Swap Frog on the field by sacrificing a level 1 Water/Aqua monster on the field to the graveyard. Using a level 2 Aqua/Water Monster (most frogs), It will also allow you to Special Summon Glacial Beast Polar Penguin, activating its exceedingly rude field removal effect (back to hand), Gora Turtle, which stops anyone from attacking with anything higher than 1900 ATK, or Graydle Alligator, which, when Destroyed by either Spell or Battle, allows you to take control of an opponents monster.  -Salvage Swap Frog and another Frog when it's convenient. Load your graveyard up.  -Build up to Accesscode Talker using link monsters of a lower link level and a single Ronintoadin bouncing itself back to the field repeatedly. This will allow you to give Accesscode Talker a metric shit ton of Link monsters to banish in order to activate its omni-removal effect."

Your main plan is too summon as many level 3 monsters as possible and xyz into Cicada King and Scaradiator. This deck prefers to go first since it allows it to play with a smaller chance of being disrupted.  <strong>Detailed analysis of every card:</strong>  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Centibit"">Digital Bug Centibit</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. You can switch this card to defence position with cards such as stumbling in order to use its effect and go into a rank 3 monster. Very good card to have in your oppening hand if you have stumbling as well. Its xyz effect can allow easy otk's and destruction of the opponets monsters.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. Probably the best one depending on your situation. Its effect allows to special summon any level 3 insect from hand which makes it easy to summon any rank 3. It can also change other Digital Bugs to defence and trigger their effects. Its xyz effect is by far the best one and will give you a major advantage against your opponet. It changes all monsters they control to defence and also makes their attack 0 which makes them easy targets. It also gives you an easy way to summon Mother Spider.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Cocoondedenser"">Digital Bug Cocoondedenser</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. This one is great to have in the late game where you will likely have a Digital Bug in your graveyard. Other than that its xyz effect is good in order to counter any battle traps your opponet may have.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug LEDybug"">Digital Bug LEDybug</a>: One of the Digital Bug cards. Its good in order to add cards like Websolder or other combo extenders to hand. Other than that its xyz effect can give you some draw power which is always good.  <a data-name=""Mirror Ladybug"">Mirror Ladybug</a>: One of your combo extenders. While you only control one level 3 monster you can special summon this card and make it level 3 in order to summon a rank 3 monster. It is not the best combo extender since it requires for you to have only one monster which will likely only happen during early game however it is still good enough to run at 3 and make the deck more consistent.  <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker"">Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</a>: One of your combo extenders. This one is just insane since you can summon it for free with almost no draw backs and it is a level 3 insect. This card is great to have during any moment in the duel and it is also a good monster to search with LEDybug.  <a data-name=""Galaxy Worm"">Galaxy Worm</a>: All you need to do is normal summon this card and you have a rank 3 xyz. It is a very good card to have during your oppening hand but it can prove to be much less useful during the rest of the game.  <a data-name=""Kumootoko"">Kumootoko</a>: Its a level 3 insect normal monster. The only reason you play this at 3 is for Giant Ball Park. You just need to hope you dont draw it and everything will go well. You can also summon it with Giant Ball Park if it is in gy when a monster you control is sent to gy which is a nice addition to its primary effect.  <a data-name=""Mother Spider"">Mother Spider</a>: Very good card to ruin your opponets board. It is usually easy to resolve this effect with cards like Websolder and Stumbling so its a great addition to the deck. The only reason I play 1 is because it is a brick during your oppening hand.  <a data-name=""Speedroid Terrortop"">Speedroid Terrortop</a>: An easy special summoned which will give you a rank 3 xyz. When summoned make sure to add Taketomborg so that you can special summon it and go into a rank 3.  <a data-name=""Speedroid Taketomborg"">Speedroid Taketomborg</a>: A card which you dont want to draw ever. Its only use is being searched with Terrortop and going into rank 3. You can also special summon it if you control Cicada King which makes it more useful.  <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>: This cards purpose is being sent to gy with Giant Ball Park or foolish burrial so you can add any insect you need at the time. You do not want to draw this.  <a data-name=""Giant Ball Park"">Giant Ball Park</a>: A very strong field spell and great addition to the deck. This card can special summon two Kumootoko's with its effect which gives you access to any rank 3. It can also summon Kumootoko from gy if a monster you control is sent to gy which is a nice effect to have.  <a data-name=""Stumbling"">Stumbling</a>: A very good card to have in this deck since your monsters gain alot of effects from changing their positions. Basically all the you have to do is just summon a card like Digital Bug LEDybug in attack position and then Stumbling will trigger which puts it in defence giving you the effect. It also slows down opponets plays and prevents them from otking you.  <a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>: You can use this card in order to summon your other xyz monsters. Normally a card like this will not be needed however it can be very useful in times where your opponet has the advantage. You can also activate it when your opponet would destroy an xyz monster you control in order to replace it with another one.  <a data-name=""Photon Lead"">Photon Lead</a>: Special summon monsters from your hand to extend comboes.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burrial"">Foolish Burrial</a>: To send Gokipole to gy.  <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: To add Giant Ball Park.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Scaradiator"">Digital Bug Scaradiator</a>: An easy negate and also change your opponets battle position. It also attached cards it destroys as materials. You will probably want to summon this after you have summoned Cicada. You can also use it to summon the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage.</a>  <a data-name=""Number 3 Cicada King"">Number 3 Cicada King</a>: The best card in the deck. This shoul be the first xyz you summon. It can negate a monster effect and also summon the insects that it detaches which makes it easy to summon other rank 3 monsters. If you manage to xyz summon this using Digital Bug Websolder then you will have a great advantage.  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a><a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">: Summoned with Digital Bug Scaradiator or Bug Signal. It is good for certain situations.</a>  <a data-name=""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"">Digital Bug Rhinosebus</a>: You will almost never summon this but it has destruction effect and could be used in situations where you need to kill your opponet fast. <div class=""page-header__main""> <div class=""page-header__main""></div> </div> <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a>: This card is great to have since it can practically negate a monster effect and also provides draw power.  <a data-name=""Inzektron Extra-Stag"">Inzektron Extra-Stag</a>: Your primary target for Bug Signal since it can easily get rid of your opponets monsters and also remove cards from their gy.  <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>: Backrow removal.  Number 28 Titanic Moth: For the otks.  <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">Seraphim Papillon</a>: The only decent link monster for this deck. This card can bring back alot of insects from your gy in order to make rank 3's but it can also be used as a beatstick"

Some starters for this deck include all of the <strong>Adamancipator</strong> <strong>Tuners</strong>, <strong>Doki</strong> <strong>Doki</strong> and <strong>Madolche</strong> <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong>. The most interesting monster has to be <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong> because has you probably know it has seen play in <strong>Adamancipator</strong> decks before but what has not seen that much play is <strong>Anjelly</strong> ,but it comes in useful in this combo. <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong> eff, special summon <strong>Anjelly</strong>, <strong>Anjelly</strong> eff, summon <strong>Petingcessoeur</strong>, overlay into <strong>Gallant</strong> <strong>Granite</strong>. Has you can see if you played <strong>Madolche</strong> before you'll know that they have a level five monster and since <strong>Petingcessoeur's</strong> effect reduces level why not play that monster, simple because I'm also playing <strong>Gigantes</strong> and its effect banishes 1 earth monster to special summon itself you can banish <strong>Anjelly</strong> to special summon it and since <strong>Adamancipator's</strong> like to swarm the field. Any way another oddity is why I'm playing 2 <strong>Adamancipator</strong> <strong>Crystals</strong> the reason is it makes <strong>Seeker</strong> much less bricky and its practically a plus 2 when you special summon it onto the field with an <strong>Adamancipator's</strong> effect another is that if you choose to play <strong>Toadally</strong> its also a great target for that. Finally here's a combo you will want to miss out on the up to 3200 Atk wall and a draw yay. This combo requires a level 4 monster plus <strong>Halq</strong> and it also has to be your opponents turn.  <strong>Halq</strong> eff, summon <strong>Formula</strong>, summon <strong>Nothung</strong> use on strong monster. I would like an opinion on this deck so plz tell me."

Arc V series.,"Fluffals are a strategy able to go both 1st and 2nd. Going 1st the deck can quite consistently summon 1 VFD using multiple Frightfur Cruel Whales. This can usually also be accompanied by a Toadally awesome and sometimes even more interruptions. The key to the deck is really in abusing the non-once per turn search cards and the ability to draw crazy numbers of cards each turn to fuel your fusion plays. Going 2nd: the deck can quite easily beat over large boss monsters using Cruel Whale, Sabre Tooth, Kraken and Tiger. To facilitate going 2nd, this list runs a total of 7 handtraps: 3 Ash, 2 Nibiru &amp; 2 Edge Imp Scythe which if drawn in addition to any Fluffal monster can quick effect fusion summon Cruel Whale to destroy cards on field (any more handtraps results in poor turn 1 consistency but that is a legitimate route to take if opting for a more Go 2nd oriented build)"

This sets the field up so that you can go for a Blood Rose Dragon (blow up field) or a Crystal Wing (negate) on your opponents turn using Halqifibrax's second effect to special summon a turner synchro monster such as Formula Synchron or Shooting Riser Dragon. The deck is very consistent at performing this set-up; here are few ways to do so:  I: Predaplant Scorpio <ol>  	<li>Summon Predaplant Scorpio and activate effect to summon Cobra from deck</li>  	<li>Cobra adds instant fusion</li>  	<li>Activate instant fusion to summon Theseus and go into Halqifibrax to get Red Rose Dragon</li>  	<li>Use Red Rose Dragon and left-over Predaplant to go into Marjoram</li> </ol> II: Witch of the Blood Rose and White Rose Dragon or Wheeleder <ol>  	<li>Summon Witch of the Blood Rose to add Witch of the Black Rose and stack Rose Fairy on top of deck</li>  	<li>Summon Witch of the Black Rose to draw Rose Fairy</li>  	<li>Rose Fairy activates to special summon itself</li>  	<li>Special summon Wheeleder and go into Halqifibrax. Alternativately, make Halqifibrax first, then special summon White Rose Dragon</li> </ol> III: Righty Driver and White Rose Dragon or Wheeleder <ol>  	<li>Summon Righty Driver to special summon Lefty Driver</li>  	<li>Use Lefty Driver's second effect to make itself level 3</li>  	<li>Special summon Wheeleder and go into Halqifibrax. Alternativately, make Halqifibrax first, then special summon White Rose Dragon</li> </ol> Lonefire Blossom makes it so you can pull Witch of the Blood Rose or Predaplant Scorpio out of the deck for added consistency. Rose Princess also allows you to save your normal summon to go for a more extended play or bait an Ash Blossom. With any of the set-ups listed above, you can end with 1 negate (Crystal Wing) and 1 pop (Crocodragon,) or 1 pop and 1 field clear (Blood Rose Dragon.) Lefty/Righty Driver can be removed and replaced with Ash Blossoms or other negate cards.
