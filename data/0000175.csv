I think this deck is definitely a solid contender for a spot as a rogue deck once it comes out.

<strong>Combo #1 (Spell Negate/Monster Negate/OTK) Two monsters on board and a rank-up in hand (this can also just be an Ascended Sage +Â  one more monster)</strong>

Overlay for Utopia and use whichever rank-up spell you have access to and follow depending on which you have:

<strong>ZEXAL Force (Monster Negates):</strong> Make Leo Utopia Ray (put whatever card on top), effect, equip Pegasus Twin Saber. (If you have access to it then equip the lighting blade as well for protection)

<strong>Hope Force (Spell Negate/OTK):</strong> Make Dragner, Make Draglubion, (Spell Negates:) Make Hope Harbinger, (OTK:) Make Number 100

<strong>Combo #2 (OTK Combo): Two monsters including an Arms Sage (or an Aura Strike in hand)</strong>

Make a Utopia Double, rank up into Utopia Beyond, equip Aura Strike, attack for game"

<span>Average Pure Lyrilusc Enjoyer:</span>

<span>Hi guys, this deck is not 100% original, its an ""improvement"" to a deck that i saw, if you want the original deck list here is the link https://ygoprodeck.com/lyrilusc-bird-call-deck-2021/</span>

<span>Here are the combos (Note: Because the combos don't need too many cards and can be searched easely you can made more than one in a turn):Â </span>

<span>Lyrilusc nest thief: When you have a Lyrilusc monster in your field, use Swallow Nest to search for sparrow, then add beryl canary with sparrow effect and summon the lyrilusc monster in your GY with canary (This also work with One for One and the canary target will be the discarded monster).</span>

<span>Blue and turquoise are the best team: Thanks to swallow effect, you can summon turquoise from your hand with her, and you can summon another monster from your hand or GY (If you summon sparrow search for canary and do the nest thief combo)</span>

<span>These are some combos that come to my mind, but this deck has too much potential. I always liked Lulu deck and with the new support are more than powerful. Note: Yeah, Eater of Millions can't be used as an XYZ material, but is a level one free summon so it's good.</span>"

<h2>DECK LIST:</h2>
<h3>MONSTERS:</h3>
2x Raiho: this is really the main reason I even play the Ice Barriers in the first place because it's effect its almost the strongest in the archetype, just below Trish and maybe Trish Zero. The only reason i'm not running 3 is because it can brick a lot easier if you run more than 2

3x Wayne: Insanely good starter, fetches Medallion on summon and is the perfect target for Zuijin's effects.

3x Revealer: Also a really good card, fetches Hexa Spirit and get's your combos going.

2x Speaker: Only reason i'm not running 3 of this is because i didn't want to play 41 cards, but other than that you should definitely run it at 3 because its a free body on board and can give you a token if you need it (it doesn't come up too often but it's still nice to have).

3x Prior: Free extender, helps frog combos and can get cards like Wayne and Raiho beck from the grave, the main reason the two have synergy.

1x Zuijin: mostly just the target to send off of Hexa Spirit and if you see it in your hand, discard fodder, but it's also an extender with Wayne being the perfect target for them.

2x Hexa Spirit: the tuner for Revealer to special from deck with, use it's effect to send Zuijin or Prior if you cant send Zuijin.

1x Fishborg launcher: My target tuner of choice for Halifibrax, basically just jest synchron for waters

3x Swap Frog: Best frog. Its a free special summon and if you open Zuijin it's the perfect discard fodder, plus it dumps off a frog on summon in addition to a self bounce for a second normal summon for a frog.

2x Ronintoadin: would play 3 but i didn't want to play 41 cards, its your frog extender that is used for Toadally materials

3x Dupe Frog: Forces Attack targets to him which can be handy to stop an OTK from something like a Borrelsword and it searches a frog when sent to grave.
<h3>SPELLS:</h3>
Monster Reborn, enough said

Called by the Grave: this deck has trouble playing around handtraps, this is the perfect answer to them and at worst you have a D.D Crow when needed.

3x Medallion: ROTA for the Ice Barriers, that's really all i need to say

3x Freezing Chains: A monster reborn for the Ice Barriers and has some nifty protection that comes up every once in a while.

2x Winds: this card is handy to have and can setup both your grave and field with Ice Barrier monsters you need.
<h3>TRAPS:</h3>
3x Dinomischus: The best Paleo card in the archetype and is a free summon for Toad plays or link climbing

2x Strike: one of the best traps in the format negating monster effects and summons.
<h3>EXTRA DECK:</h3>
Trish Zero: non-targeting banish removal which is really good in a format like this one, also it can summon trish from deck but it's not that good.

White Aura Bihamut: this may seem like a weird option but its a free token generator that is a major beatstick that can help seal in games or just used as Coral Anemone fodder, which is also good.

Trish: play it at 3 if it ever goes back, Some of the best removal in the game from each of the resources to consider that doesn't target

Dragite: Don't know whether to play 2 or not but it's a Spell/Trap negate for free so there's that.

White Aura Whale: Literally a Mirror Force on summon and can double attack along with Piercing to seal games. Plus when it's sent to the GY, you can just bring it back and make it a tuner if your into that!

2x Coral Dragon: This may seem like a weird option but hear me out, the main reason i play it is because it's a tuner synchro that you can just play for some removal if you need it and then synchro again for a free draw! It's one of my favourite things about the deck.

Desert Locusts: your target off of Halqifibrax, its a free hand rip and another synchro summon on your opponent's turn

2x Toadally Awesome: The main reason to run the Frog engine, it has everything you could really ask for in a card.

Abyss Dweller: Locks the Grave from effects so it's a handy card to have especially in this format.

Bahamut Shark: Gets toad out if your frogs can't.

Halqifibrax: A must in any deck that uses Synchro cards.

2x Coral Anemone: Brings back waters from grave

&nbsp;

That's about it for now, I'll put in a deck guide later (if i remember to), <em>addio!</em>"

You can also go into Borrelsword right away, or Knightmare Phoenix / Linkuriboh if you need to. You can start setting up ABC now, getting the field spell out is very important. ABC needs a few turns, and Appliancer can stay alive for a turn or two generally with Laundry Dragon spam. Storming Mirror Force and Quaking Mirror Force can actually put a large wrench in opponent's plans as these are non-targeting. We also have a Magic Cylinder, and it works pretty well. Because this back is pretty backrow heavy, we play triple Waking the Dragon to catch a Harpie's Feather Duster or any sort of spell/trap removal as it allows us to go into Ultimate Falcon which can often be GG. I run two ABC Dragon Busters beacuse I am limited in the extra deck, and we can go into two sometimes. Appliancer Reuse is like a monster reborn and helps us go into our Lanudry Dragon play again. Appliancer Electrilyical World makes the Appliancer plays a lot more consistent, but the real star here is triple Union Hangar as it is crucial for ABC and beacuse of that we also run 1 Terraforming.

As for my side deck, Lancea is pretty standard, counters Dino, Pankratops is self explanatory, dirt cheap, Kaijus help for something like a boosted Dragoon that not even Ultimate Falcon can beat, Effect Veiler is here because we don't have the budget for Ash Blossom or even Droll or Ghost Ogre. Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon is a huge easy to summon beatstick with ABC, but this can be swapped out for whatever you like. 2 Cosmic Cyclone for extra removal, 3 Solemn Warnings because we're on a tight budget, and 1 Red Lotus. The side deck is up to you, as it can really just depend on what you want to counter, or what sees a lot of play at your Locals.

Overall a really fun to play deck, I know it's not very competitve, but it really can put in some work (I've gotten Borrelsword + 2 ABC out before quite a few times in testing, and you could even get a Raidraptor out) and it's dirt cheap. (would be even cheaper before YT videos got made on Appliancer) I hope you enjoyed this deck list."

Forbidden drip evenly match and lightning storm are great at breaking apart most decks turn 1

After breaking it getting out dragoon is not hard but not a guarantee. Chance of having no follow up is too high.

Not enough starters to be as good as top meta decks but def not a bad deck

The free special summons from the Battlewasps help make Picofalena and get your combo rolling. Ideal endboard is a 3-mat Baboozling Gossip Shadow, 3-mat Apollousa, Cicada King, and Seraphim Papillon.

Now on to the card breakdown.

The Inzektors:

Dragonfly: The reason this deck works. Turns out having a special summon effect that's not once per turn is <strong>pretty strong</strong>. Who'd have thought. Summon Centipedes with this until you run out of them, then summon whatever, you're just going for link/xyz materials.

Centipede: The searcher. Once again an example of why cards are usually once per turn. Use this to search what you need, usually the Giga-Inzektors or Zektkaliber to pop with Hornet to get more Dragonfly summons.

Ladybug: The most compact way to trigger Centipede or Dragonfly, and you can Insect Imitation it into a Dragonfly to start your combo. Also good for level manipulating into the ED Inzektors.

Hornet: The Big Guns. Use this to wipe your opponent's whole board, or pop the Giga-Inzektors and Zektkaliber.

Giga-Mantis: Equips from hand so you can equip it to Dragonfly or Centipede for more effects, plus it summons from grave when you pop it with Hornet.

Giga-Weevil: Once again, equips from hand to bypass the once per turn for Dragonfly and Centipede, plus summons from grave. Slightly less useful unique effect compared to Mantis, when are you gonna need a 2600 DEF Inzektor? Never, that's when.

Zektkaliber: Equips from hand. You should know why that's good by now. Also lets you get Inzektors in your grave back into your hand for discard fodder.

Next, the Battlewasp engine.

Sting the Poison: Searches the other two, plus can be Insect Imitationed into the good Inzektors.

Twinbow the Attacker: Special Summons itself from hand, plus it's level 3 so you can use it for rank 3s. Locks you into insects though, so ideally use it after you've set up your Apollousa/Bamboozle.

Pin the Bullseye: Specials from hand, good for making Picofalena, and doesn't lock you into insects. What's not to love? Plus, it has the most powerful card in the game, Sparks, built in!

Summoning Swarm: Did someone say Soul Charge?

Finally, the oddball stuff.

Digital Bug Websolder: Level 3 and summons level 3 insects from hand, which is <em>checks notes</em> 40% of the deck and most of your good monsters.

Insect Imitation: Turns Parasite Paranoid, Sting the Poison, and Ladybug into Dragonfly or Centipede.

Parasite Paranoid: Stops your opponent's monster from targeting your bugs, plus is a Imitation target if push comes to shove.

Foolish Burial: Searches Hornet and Ladybug.

Now, on to the extra deck.

Borreload Savage Dragon: Easy omni-negate. This deck makes level 8 synchros pretty easily.

Hama the Conquering Bow: OTK tool.

Azusa the Ghost Bow: A stepping stone synchro, plus it re-summons itself if you kill something with Hama.

Herald Of the Arc Light: An omni-negate and Macro Cosmos welded together. Can be a little inconvenient to summon.

Martial Metal Marcher: Level 3 for rank 3 plays, synch Sting and Pin into this then revive Sting.

Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus: It's Zeus, your opponent will not be able to keep anything on the field.

Inzektor Exa-Stag: Can be a Big Dumb Beater&#x2122; or yoink something valuable out of your opponent's graveyard. Plus it can trigger Dragonfly/Centipede and get rid of an opponent's card at the same time.

Cicada King: A negate that can summon an insect from grave.

Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: A negate, plus a good rank-up for Zeus considering it can have 3-4 mats.

Borrelsword: An easy OTK tool, you'll have no problem getting enough mats.

Apollousa: You can pretty easily get 3-4 negates on this thing.

Seraphim Papillion: Quick effect insect res. Good for triggering Sting or setting up a Dragonfly.

Crystron Halqifibrax: Turns a Sting into a Papillion.

Picofalena: Starts your combos. Get a Hornet or Ladybug from deck, or if you're really in a pickle a Dragonfly to res next turn with Papillion.

&nbsp;

Now go and make Weevil proud."

The basic combo requires just any two Igknights and Zefraath(which I have 3 of + 6 searchers) in your opening hand. Pendulums were hit hard because of master rule 5 so isolde is there to help open up as much zones for extra deck pendulum summon as possible and search a scale. The deck is best suited for going second, it can be quite easily crippled by negation. Ash hitting Igknight search effect for example is very devastating. But once you establish your negate board, it's very hard for opponent to break it. Even Dark Ruler No More doesn't help against the counter traps. The deck does tend to brick a bit more often than I'd like it to. It also can't run much handtraps since it requires quite a lot to set up. </span>

In advance, director Simon McQuoid has talked a lot about wanting to be true to the violent roots of the ""Mortal Kombat"" games as much as possible with the new film, which I can safely say that they have succeeded with.Â <a>https://fastandfurious9denmark.wildapricot.org/film/10544581</a>

Already three minutes into the film, the blood begins to splash and after two hours, body parts have had time to fly in all directions, the head has been pointed and the intestines have been exposed. Whether it succeeds on other fronts is a completely different matter.Â <a>https://blockhelden.de/community/profile/fastandfuriousgerman/</a>

Just like in the games, the premise is that humanity must take part in a battle tournament against the evil kingdom Outworld, in order to prevent Emperor Shang Tsung from conquering the earth. However, a prophecy says that a group of fighters will unite and defeat the darkness.Â  <a>https://treasurechest.com.ua/community/profile/fastandfurious9/</a>

Here we meet the mediocre MMA fighter and brand new character Cole Young (Lewis Tan), who is suddenly chased by the emperor's icy right hand Sub-Zero. Cole has a birthmark on his chest that resembles a dragon's head, like a legendary warrior who fought in tournaments hundreds of years ago.Â <a>https://treasurechest.com.ua/community/profile/wrathofman/</a>

After escaping the cold villain, he meets other fighters from the games such as Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Jax (Mehcad Brooks) and Kano (Josh Lawson) with the same mark on their body, which turns out to be a sign that they are selected to fight for the fate of the earth.Â <a>https://www.verticalvic.fr/community/profile/fastandfurious9france/</a>

Weather painters is a control base deck which relies on low level fairy monsters to gain quick effects via their corresponding continuous spell/trap. All of the continuous spell/traps in the deck have the monsters banish themselves as cost so they can easily avoid danger and easily control the number of monsters on the field, then having them selves special summon back to the field during either player's stand by phase. This deck is mainly good at slowly gaining advantage over time by either searching cards via continuous spell, bouncing monsters back to opponents hand during combat, or by running lots of destruction card such as torrential tribute or needle ceiling then banishing your monsters as cost for other effects to avoid destruction. This deck also HEAVILY relies on many forms of floodgates such <a data-name=""SKILL DRAIN"">SKILL DRAIN</a>, LOSE 1 TURN, MACRO COSMOS, DIMENSION FISSURE, NECROVALLEY, and MYSTIC MINE. Be warned this deck does use lots of complicated mechanics like constantly using the cost of banishing to your favor and a good amount of timing rules need to be learned to play this deck properly.

<span><strong><span>Summary of weather painters</span></strong></span>

<strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>

<strong>ALL</strong> weather monsters have the effect: during the standby phase of the turn after this card was banished from the field to activate a ""The Weather"" card's effect: You can Special Summon this banished card.

<strong><span>Weather Painter</span></strong><span><span>Â </span><strong>Snow (lvl 3) </strong><span>she is the searcher of the deck, must play at 3 copies, and when she is normal summoned she </span><b>places 1 </b><span><b>weather</b></span><b> canvas </b><span><b>continuous</b></span><b> spell/trap from deck,</b> since she places directly from deck this can work around things like anti-spell fragrance. When normal summoned normally place onto the field her respective weather canvas snow which is the decks searcher.</span>

<strong>Weather Painter Thunder (lvl 3)Â  </strong>he is the highest atk level 3 weather painter and can send <strong>ANY </strong>face up continuous spell/trap for cost ""including your generic floodgates like skill drain"" toÂ <strong>Place</strong> a different weather canvas from deck to field, must play 3 copies.

<strong>Weather Painter Cloudy (lvl 3)</strong> works in combination with thunder or can be used to protect your weather canvas backrow, if a weather card leaves the field target up to 2 weather canvas' from grave and <strong>PlaceÂ </strong>them face up, play 2 - 3 copies.

<strong>Weather Painter Sun (lvl 3)</strong> he can special summon himself from grave by sendingÂ <strong>Any</strong> continuous spell/trap from field to grave and replacing it with another weathery canvas from hand, he is used incase you need to trigger torrential tribute or for link summoning, play 1.

<strong>Weather painter Rain (lvl 3)Â </strong>when she is special summoned, place a weather canvas from hand to field, this is used if your opponent destroyed a weather canvas during your turn and you need to activate another canvas for you opponents turn, not particularly useful as both weather painter cloud and aurora can do this job better, play 0 - 1.

<strong>Weather Painter Aurora (lvl 6)</strong> when she is normal summoned place a weather canvas from deck to field, also when she is face up on field your opponent can not target or destroy your weather spell/traps. Play 1 but you will most likely just special summon her from deck using weather canvas rainbow.

<strong>Weather Painter Rainbow (link 3)</strong> she rarely gets played but has an amazing effect, if a weather painter is under a zone she points to, banish that weather painter andÂ <strong>Negate any card effect or activation</strong>. Furthermore she can tribute herself toÂ <strong>Negate special summon.Â </strong>This deck doesn't ever use the extra deck so just play 3 of her incase you want to use her and don't want her to get hit by pot of extravagance.

<span><strong>Spells/Traps</strong></span>

<strong>ALLÂ </strong>weather spells/traps are continuous and gives the monster directly in front and adjacent to it a quick effect which allows the monster to <strong>Banish themselves as cost, and activates effect in banish zone</strong>. Then during the next standby phase the weather painters have an effect to special summon themselves.

<strong><span>Weather snow canvasÂ </span></strong><span>is the searcher of the deck play 3. When using this card also use it to avoid danger such as if your opponent plays raigeki, simply banish all monsters this spell points to and banish them then search your 1 card, though this card states that you can only search 1 card per turn with this effect, you can stillÂ <strong>pay the cost of banishing</strong> your monsters to avoid danger.</span>

<strong>Weather thunder canvas</strong> when a weather painter you control battles a monster, banish the weather painter to return the opponents monster back to hand, this can be useful when playing a kaiju engine to kaiju your opponent then return kaiju back to hand, furthermore this effect is non targeting and can get rid of boss monsters with destruction and targeting immunities. Play 2 - 3.

<strong>Weather cloud canvasÂ </strong>banish your monster then target 1 monster on the field and half its atk and that monster can attack directly, if you don't have weather snow canvas on field and need to quickly avoid danger use this card instead, and this could be used with mystic mine as well, if your opponent can't get less monsters on feild then you, you an easily half one of your monsters and let it attack your opponent directly. Play 0-1.

<strong>Weather sun canvasÂ </strong>banish a weather painter you control then target 1 monster you control and tribute it then special summon 1 weather painter from your hand, do not play this.

<strong>Weather rain canvas</strong> banish a weather painter to target 1 spell/trap you opponent controls and return to hand, this can do a soft spell lock as you can also run anti-spell fragrance forcing your opponent to set their spells then use this card to bounce it back to hand, this can also bounce your opponents mirror forces before you attack. Play 0-1.

<strong>Weather aurora canvas </strong>you can banish a weather painter when anyone adds a card from deck to hand, banish that added card and they draw a new card, can be used to snipe key combo pieces. Play 0-1.

<strong>Weather rainbow canvas</strong> banish a weather painter monster to special summon 1 weather painter from deck to field if your opponent controls at least 1 monster. Normally used to summon aurora, cloud, thunder, summon aurora for dmg or protecting backrow same as cloud, summon thunder to replace rainbow canvas with snow canvas. This card also combos well with torrential tribute as you can easily special a monster from deck then chain that summon with torrential tribute during your opponents turn. Play 3.

<span><strong><span>Deck Techs</span></strong></span>

<span><strong>Board Nukes</strong></span>

<span>There are a few ways to easily play board nukes in this deck but mainly playing torrential tribute and needle ceiling. For <strong>needle ceiling</strong> you can simply wait out as long as possible before activating needle ceiling then nuking the board, then chain all monsters on the field by banishing themselves for cost to either search a card from deck using the weather canvas snow or by targeting 1 monster on the fieldÂ  and halving their atk with cloudy canvas. <strong>Torrential tribute</strong> can also be activated extremely easily in this deck as well, by using the weather canvas rainbow, you can ""at the end of opponent main phase 1 or start of battle phase"" special summon from deck any weather painter monster then activate torrential tribute, then simply banish all monsters on your field as cost to activate your continuous spell/traps. Furthermore <strong>Nibiru</strong> can be easily played around as well similar to needle ceiling, right at the end of main phase or beginning of battle phaseÂ  simply first activate effect of weather rainbow canvas, then Nibiru, then banish your remaining monsters with weather canvas snow.</span>

<span><strong>Mystic Mine</strong></span>

Since weather painters can easily control the number of monsters on your side of the field at all times, mystic mine can be played around. To use this card you must always have to guess how many monsters your opponent will have on board at all time, if you know your opponent does not play generic link monsters can cant link all of their monsters for a single monster then you can leave more monsters on your side of the field, else just banish all of your monsters on field using snowy canvas or cloudy canvas effect. Furthermore you can easily get rid of mystic mine at the end of your opponents turn by either using <strong>needle ceiling</strong> then banishing your monsters away or by using weather rainbow canvas to special summon a monster from deck and then activating <strong>torrential tribute</strong>, then chain and banish all your monsters again to avoid destruction, at the end of your opponents turn both players will not have any monsters each and mystic mine is destroyed.

<span><strong>Floodgates</strong></span>

<strong><span>Skill</span><span> drainÂ </span></strong><span>can be played around as ALL of your weather painters will first <strong>banish themselves for cost, </strong>thenÂ <strong>Activate in banish zone,</strong> this is good as skill drainÂ <strong>Only</strong> negates monsters on field. SimilarlyÂ <strong>lose 1 turn</strong> does the same however requires the activation for you to have no special summoned monsters on field, to work around this the turn you set lose 1 turn, banish all your monsters first, then on opponent standby phase activate lose 1 turn first then special summon all of your banished weather painters back.Â </span>

<strong>Macro cosmos, Dimensional fissure, and Necrovalley</strong> aren't going to be an issue for you as no monsters should ever go to grave except potentially weather painter sun but he can float back to the field or by using weather painter thunders effect to destroy an old continous spell/trap andÂ  place a new canvas with weather painter cloud on field to bring back destroyed weather spells/traps.

<strong>Anti-SpellÂ </strong><b>fragrance</b> can be played around as weather painters thunder, snow, and aurora all place weather canvas' directly from deck to field and <strong>DOES NOT</strong> <strong>activate them</strong>.

<span><strong>Hand traps</strong></span>

<span>Play any hand traps you desire as you can easily empty your field to resolve gamma, and you don't need a graveyard so dimensional shifter wont effect you. Herold hand traps could also work asÂ <strong>ALL</strong> weather painters are faries.</span>

<strong><span>General traps</span></strong>

<strong><span>Mirror forceÂ </span></strong><span>line up especially drowning as you can easily banish all monsters on your field leaving you wide open for a direct attack thus allowing you to use drowning, mainly use mirror force line up if you are getting constantly monster destruction on you field and your opponent can easily otk you when your board is empty.</span>

<strong>Waking the dragon and artifact sanctum</strong> can both be used to blind set if your opponent regularly uses lighting storm, and artifact sanctum can also get into artifact scythe for an extra deck lock.

<span><strong>Strategy</strong></span>

First and foremost this is a <strong>Control deckÂ </strong>and is mainly relying on wildling down your opponent and poking them to death, it cannot otk even on an empty board. Your main strategy is to stall and hold out as long as possible before triggering you board nukes then banish your weather painter then attack on your next turn. With cards like weather canvas thunder you can get rid of lots of boss monsters that have destruction and targeting immunities by simply bouncing them back to hand. Since majority of the floodgates are monster negation stalling out should be even easier as you steadily gain advantage over time. The deck list currently shown is for going blind in a match so it is middle ground for either going first or second without an issue however it is not optimized for either.

<strong>When going first,</strong> side in more floodgates and board nukes can you can easily sit on them and wait for your opponent to act. Hand traps could be useful for going first however hand traps are just 1 time use so floodgates are greatly more valued as it can last for multiple turns.

<strong>When going second,Â </strong>running 3 mystic mines an terraforming is necessary as you opponent most likely has a large board. Reducing the number of trap field nukes would be good as you won't be able to activate them right away, but keeping a few copies wont hurt as you can easily stall while getting ready to use those traps on your opponents turn. Siding in more hand traps is greatly valued and dark ruler no more, black hole, or raigeki can always help as well. Kaiju package would also be useful as they can easily be returned to your hand once a turn so you can easily kaiju 2 trouble card every turn.

<strong>Siding</strong> when siding never lower the amount of your standard weather painter monsters or spells/traps that will greatly reduce your consistency mainly focus on all of the tech cards, the weather painter portion of the deck only takes up 19 cards, the remaining 21 can be switched based on the match up but be cautious when siding out your draw power."

Control doesn't have to be set 5 pass.,"My take on modern control with some spice! Recommendations welcome.

Update:Â  Trying to make the deck have a more reliable end game.Â  Added some higher attack Punishment targets in the extra.Â  Underworld goddess is just a 3000 atk option as well as the slight chance of actually pulling it off.Â  The same can be said about 5-headed link.Â  Just use it to get over really high atk monsters with Punishment but occasionally you technically could summon it.

Update 2:Â  Added Redoer as a toolbox option since it synergizes so well with Shade Brigandine.Â  I should also note that you should banish whatever you don't foresee yourself using with Prosperity.

Update 3:Â  Removed Vanquish Viking for Network Trap Hole.Â  Vanquish doesn't seem as relevant after some testing and network is online against most matchups.Â  It's especially potent against Eldlich.

Update 4:Â  Dropped a copy of Horror House to add back 1 copy of Vanquish.Â  This is to prevent some bad hands and technically give the deck a bit more versatility.Â  I think the new ratio of 2 and 1 is a bit better.Â  If Konami does add a better option than Vanquish as a secondary Amazement trap, I'll be sure to test it."

On a surface level, Springans don't need a normal summon and Time Thiefs brings a powerful normal summon, Time Thief Regulator, a archetypal Rescue Rabbit to the board. Additionally, Springans' core field spell, Great Sand Sea- Gold Golganda, prevents OTK when Time Thief Redoer is threatened.

Taking a closer look at the individual cards, Time Thief Bezel Ship and Time Thief Winder find easy materials to detach from the shared effects of all Springans monster to attach themselves to their archetypal XYZs while Time Thief Chronocorder is happy to trigger itself off Merrymaker and sit under the protection of Gold Golganda. Springans brings the firepower to the table with the unique board destruction effect of Exblower, and enables 4 materials Zeus.

&nbsp;

Cards Choices and Ratio Explanation:

2 Branga: Springans sucks to draw in multiples and level 8 Springans are even more useless when you are cutoff from the field spell. There are 3 major targets to consider when searching, Springans Rockey, Springans Watch, and Springans Blast. Springans Blast is the one you should consider the most, but Merrymaker's effect to send Sprind, the Iron Dragon effect for a follow up is powerful too.

2 Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda : While central to the Springans Strategy, with Pot of Prosperity, Springans Watch and Springans Booty, it is easy to find a copy of the field spell. What you don't want to find is the second copy of Gold Golgonda. It is a dead card that you can not even discard to summon a Springans XYZs.

2 Time Thief Winder - Brings the total target of Time Thief Regulator's target to 4, and is a body that can special summon itself.

1 Time Thief Flyback - The most questionable choice in the list, It finds the missing Chronocorder or Bezel Ship when you make Time Thief Redoer and attaches Time Thief Retrograde from deck when you make Redoer without Regulator.

1 Springans Blast - Worst Discard for Gold Golganda and might brick.

2 The Phantom Knight of Shade Brigandine - Free Level 4 body that enables Redoer. It bricks at 3 :)

Drill Driver Vespenato - DO NOT BANISH this off prosperity, it removes Merrymaker from the board so you can summon the Exblower.

Sprind the Irondash Dragon - Merrymaker can foolish this to grave, and is essentially a +2 when you summon Rockey and add back the Brothers in grave.

Dingirsu, the Orcust of Evening Star - It is possible to make rank 8 in this deck, but it doesn't come up alot, don't hesitate to banish this for prosperity if you don't think you can make it. I like Ding because it outs indestructible cards.

Time Thief Perpetua - Reborns Time Thief Redoer, and help attaches Flyback for removal or a monster when using Zeus.

&nbsp;

Gameplay( What I usually do) :

1: Make Merrymaker and Redoer, depending on the hand, you can choose to summon Captain Sargus for a pop, or make a abyss dweller. Evaluate your hand and see if you have any follow-up.

2. Survive, You usually have a spell negate, a attack negate, and the odd handtrap.

3. Make Exblower and start blasting. Maybe make a Zeus, search Springans Blast and make any Rank4.

You make a Firewall And a Tri-Gate Wizard (or a Code Talker) and pass on your first turn.

&nbsp;

<em>Powerful.</em>

&nbsp;

On your next turn, you should be able to make either an <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> or a <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> and hit for game.

Most hands should make this board pretty easily, with Clock Wyvern and the <a data-name=""Mathmech"">Mathmech </a>monsters being your main starters. opening at least 2 Mathmechs (most often with different names), an extender (<a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a>, Code Talkers, <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a>), and an eXceed will easily make your desired endboard and will be more than enough going second.

When you go second, you have 2 opinions. Either:
<ol>
 	<li>You have extra material on board and link your Tri-Gate and extender to make <a data-name=""Spartoi"">Spartoi</a>, search <a data-name=""Cynet Fusion"">Cynet Fusion</a>, and hit with Clock Dragon for 8500
OR</li>
 	<li>If you do NOT have extra material, link both into Accesscode and go from there.</li>

The story of Emilio D'Alessandro is like taken from a movie. At the age of 18, he decides to leave his hometown of Cassino in Italy to seek his fortune in Britain. He moves to London, struggles between different jobs to finally get a job at a car repair shop thanks to his accuracy and punctuality.Â <a>https://elukovafinland.blog.se/fast-and-furious-9/</a>

It also turns out that he is extremely skilled behind the wheel and soon a seed is sown for a dream in racing, more specifically Formula 1. But fate has a different plan for the young Emilio.Â <a>https://elukovafinland.blog.se/hiljainen-paikka-osa-2/</a>

Emilio's accuracy and punctuality is something that also appeals to the cherished and at this time extremely successful director, and he quickly makes a difference and hires the young driver. What at first feels like another odd job for Emilio turns out to be a life-changing story where for 30 years he becomes one of the closest people to one of film history's foremost directors.Â  <a>https://voyagersfilm.wildapricot.org/news</a>"

","A beginner-friendly trap deck oriented around summoning Uria, Lord of Searing Flames to inflict high outputs of damage.

Trap Tactics
<ul>
 	<li>Metal Reflect Slime and Statue of Anguish Pattern have very high defense, set these early on to have a solid defense while your opponent has weaker cards.</li>
 	<li>Abyss Stungray is useful as a stall card because it doesn't get destroyed in battle when activated in defense position, despite it having 0 defense. Remember to be careful of piercing attacks though!</li>
 	<li>Use Fake Trap when either Tiki Soul or Tiki Curse is active, due to the Tiki's having a low defense stat when compared to the other cards.</li>
 	<li>Booby Trap E is good for when you need just one last card to meet the Uria Summon conditions.</li>
</ul>
How to Inflict Damage without Uria
<ul>
 	<li>Zoma the Spirit is a decent way to do damage while you wait to acquire what you need for Uria. When summoned in defense position, if it gets destroyed, it reflects the damage of the attack done to it before going to your GY.</li>
 	<li>Use The Calculator as a way to do very surprising amounts of damage to opponents! Remember its damage scales off the level of all the cards on your side of the field x 300.</li>
 	<li>It's also not a bad option to have The Calculator out alongside Uria, it'll have at least 3600 attack when summoned.</li>
</ul>
Uria Advice
<ul>
 	<li>Remember to use Fallen Paradise whenever Uria is on the field, doing so makes it so Uria cannot be targeted by card effects, and you can draw two cards.</li>
 	<li>Try and set Hyper Blaze when you have at least three other traps on the field and Uria in your hand. Hyper Blaze allows you to use <strong>face-downÂ </strong>traps as tributes for Uria's special summon conditions, instead ofÂ <strong>face-up</strong> traps. If you've set cards like Fake Trap or Booby Trap E, they can be used as summon materials, and you get to keep your continuous traps on the field.</li>
 	<li>Remember with Hyper Blaze active, Uria's damage scales with the number of trap cards inÂ <strong>bothÂ </strong>graveyards, meaning Uria can do all the way up to 114,000 damage! Realistically though, with this deck, I've done up to 14,000 damage on more than one occasion.</li>
</ul>
Extra Advice
<ul>
 	<li>Use Pot of Duality whenever it appears in your hand just to give you a better chance of getting Uria, a trap card, or whatever else you need.</li>
 	<li>Save Mystical Space Typhoon in case of something like Magic Cylinder or another card that counters.</li>
 	<li>Use Effect Veiler to stop any card effects that remove The Calculator from the field, and Fallen Paradise does the same for Uria.</li>
 	<li>Use Dark Beckoning Beast to summon Chaos Summoning Beast to put Uria into the field instantly! Only use when traps are already in your graveyard, otherwise, its attack will be at 0. Also useful to have Hyper Blaze and Fallen Paradise up and active beforehand.</li>
 	<li>Magic Planter is a good way to burn your trap cards to send them to the GY and lets you do more damage when Uria is special summoned.</li>

<span>Using many combos and other things to exploit people's greed for card advantage while gaining life points so you can survive while they deck out. For example you play graceful tear and give them pot of desires. By removing their deck because people care about card advantage so much, they don't realize they are getting played. It also uses kaijus as defense.</span>

Melffy's all share the effect:

""if your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster(s) (except during the Damage Step), or if an opponent's monster targets this card for an attack""

Then they summon a mellfy or add one to your hand. Where after they return to the hand this provides a nice defence but each melffy may only use each effect once witch means some times you will have to rely on cards like rainbow life / mirror force - ish cards

additionally you get to SS all melffy's from your hand at the end of the turn (one of each kind).

So the overall strategy is to lay out your protection then SS as many as possible with spells to summon Joyous Melffys who can attack directly if you detach a card witch allows you to poke for 2000-4000 a turn then on you opponent's turn they can summon Melffys equal to there remaining matirals to set up protection again. And repeat...

Note:

This deck is still Meta and doesn't even has any hand traps."
