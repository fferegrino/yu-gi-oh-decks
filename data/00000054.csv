Long time ago, I have won with Destiny Board as <a href=""/deck/destiny-of-yataroll-430674"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Panda.</strong></a> So, I decided to make this deck even simpler with Junk Speeder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgnF93uKKZU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Draw until you find these combo pieces: Yata + Droll + Miracle Locus + Disturbance Strategy + Destiny Board. Then, set Disturbance + Miracle + Destiny and end your turn by discarding everything but Yata + Droll + Letters...</p><ul><li>Before doing so, if you have ""Chicken Game"" present onboard, destroy it with Baronne and change the button on lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"". You need to be on your toes, should the opponent tries to disrupt you.</li><li>Although I couldn't draw letter ""L"" in this clip, it doesn't matter. I could have discarded Sword instead to not deck-out anyways. Besides, ""Destiny Board"" can find letters from hand and deck.</li></ul><p>2) During your opponent's Standby Phase, activate Miracle to let your opponent draw a card. Then, activate Disturbance and chain into Droll. What will happen is Droll denies for either side to add any card to their hand. Therefore, by shuffling your opponent's hand into deck with Disturbance, they won't be able to draw/add any card afterwards, all thanks to Droll.</p><p>3) Your opponent has nothing to do but pass the turn back to you. That means you can start placing letters with ""Destiny Board"".</p><p>4) When it's your turn, Normal Summon Yata and place Sword on it. Attack the opponent with Yata, which denies your opponent from drawing any cards. When you end your turn, Yata returns to your hand and Sword is sent to GY, which makes Sword to be placed on top of your Main Deck to not deck-out by any means.</p><p>5) Repeat what was done in #3 + #4 until you win with ""Destiny Board"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Reinforcement of the Army"" can be found by completing the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found either within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Packs to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Yata-Garasu"" can be found within ""Souls of Sublime Gods"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

This is not a very smart idea to start with, but with the help of ""Bad reactions to simochi"" or ""Darklord Nurse Reficule"" you can transform the healing to burning. There are many words to describe this kind of pseudo-archetype like: nurse-burn, anti-cure, anti-heal but I call it Heal-to-burn.</p><p>The problem with this deck as I said earlier is that it's not an archetype, which means there is not searchability through cards and we have to make it decent with generic support. Most of the times we need stun-lock, to find time to gather (draw) the cards we need.</p><p>While there are other burning cards that are doing their job better than this deck, you might be able to OTK (one turn kill) with this one. Cards like ""Lava golem"" and stun-lock can be enough to win vs CPU your offline duels, while the Timelords archetype is so strong that doesn't need this outdated mechanic to win at all. But if we run cards like them, then we lost the point of the theme of this deck, where the point is heal to burn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can use cards like ""Kuribandit"" and ""Jar of Avarice"" to search through the deck easier, or even drawing cards through ""into the void"", ""card of demise"", ""Ledger of Legerdemain"" but it doesn't feel fair to have many copies of them, while they have drawbacks too...</p><p>I am very sorry to say these 2 things:</p><p>1) The main deck is not extremely optimized and I am not using the best cards (there is no spell/trap destruction).</p><p>2) The extra deck could be better, but I am kind of tired/bored to optimize it, while I run ""Pot of Extravagance"" which can destroy my try to make it better.</p><p>It might be better to run ""gravity bind"" or ""Level Limit - Area B"" as floodgates rather than stun-lock of battle phase.</p><p>Cards like ""Lilith, Lady of Lament"" and ""Trap Trick"" are quite good but they cannot search for ""Bad reactions to simochi"" at all.</p><p>You can always run an engine I've created that supports all trap cards, but it's quite slow. x3 ""A Cat of Ill Omen"", x3 ""Super-Nimble Mega Hamster"", x2 ""Necrovalley"", x2 ""Gravekeeper's Commandant"" which is a 10 card engine.</p><p>Kuribon might be a bad decision and you can remove it for something better like ""dark cure"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Meta expensive cards like S:P ain't that much of an upgrade from Unicorn, and Thrust or Fuwalos are side deck cards at best.</p><p>This list is mainly focused on going first, putting up an oppressive board while hand-ripping your opponent. There are a few good extra deck options for going second but ideally, you should let the side deck do the work. Main deck is pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary except for maybe Thunderbird which can be replaced with any card of your choice.</p><p>Losing Apollousa doesn't really affect DW because we can just make Gryphon instead. Tri-gate takes a bit more effort to set up, but the result is a stronger endboard than if you were to use any other rank 8 staple. That makes The Zombie Vampire our best rank 8 atm as it can help us play under Droll for a bit and still quite decent going second alongside with Dharc.</p><p>Magical Spring is very good in the current format against heavy face-up backrow decks like Snake-eyes and Yubel. Radian is a personal preference to out certain boss monsters while still keeping your normal summon. Puppetry is grave-hate therefore nothing more to say.</p>"

Then, Special Summon Kuriboh with Saryuja. You can also Special Summon Black Luster Soldier with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop and get rid of anything excess in MMZ if needed.</p><p>2) Place 1 x Amplifire + 2 x Generalprobe and Special Summon Guitariss from your hand. Next, Synchro Summon Rockks with Panda + Guitariss and activate Rockks to have Guitariss in your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>3) Use Rockks to pop itself and place it on Pendulum Zone besides Guitariss. If you have done everything right, you should have 3 x MMZ reserved for Basses + Synthess + Gaap. Pendulum Summon these three.</p><p>4) Activate Synthess to copycat Basses. Then, use Synthess + Basses. If you have noticed, from #2 to #4, activating ""Symphonic Warrior"" cards accumulates counters on Amplifire and Generalprobe. So, why not start using counters to burn with Amplifire? Know that after using Amplifire, activate 2nd copy to reset Amplifire and use its burn ability again.</p><p>5) Activate Lance and target on Gaap. Next, play ""Book of Eclipse"", which results into flipping down anything but Gaap thanks to Lance. However, Gaap lets them open up. This step is needed to reset Synthess and Basses in order to repeat what was explained in #4 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Book of Eclipse"" can be found within ""Beastly Claws of Terror"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Forbidden Lance"" can be found within ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gaap the Divine Soldier"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" + ""Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon"" can be found within ""Evoked Dragon of Miracles"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

An increased deck size decreases chances of drawing box or unclaspare, while increasing starter count to 14 gives it 85% chance to draw a starter. Including new Clockwork Knight gives interesting lines with Scrap Recycler. Best combo is Redeployment + Switchyard + 1 discard, which results in 2 Super Dora, Knuckle + Bullet loop, Regulus, and Citadel in the gy. Pretty resiliant to handtraps if ordered correctly. Engine isn't bad going into boards, but pairing it with 14 non-engine makes it consistent at breaking boards. Switchyard makes rank 10 plays much easier. Machinas are best into boards, and infinitracks are great for consistency and recursion. Sargas is great on the crack back, where you can insulate otk line with Regulus. Cards are relatively cheap, so this is a budget deck that gets better and more fun with more repetitions.</p>"

Next, set ""Yang Zing Unleashed"" and end your turn.</p><p>4) When it's your opponent's Draw Phase, activate the Trap you set, which locks your opponent into Battle Phase.

Well, the reason I'm not playing bonfire is because I just kinda wanted to get the deck down to 40 cards because I couldn't make a 41 card deck look good, which is very important to me. However, for the other two (as well as a few other things) I do have legitimate reasons for not running them, which is the first thing I'll go into.</p><p>1 - More Fiendsmith engine (Tract, Lurrie, Sanct, Necroquip Wave High)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously given that this is a Fiendsmith deck instead of a Fire King deck, you would expect it to be running all of these staples of the Fiendsmith engine, right? However, there is one important detail that heavily influences my decision: Almost nobody is running Nib this format. Wave High is certainly a very good card, but it's main use is undeniably to stop Nibiru. But unfortunately, Silvia has taken his job from him and so now Nibiru is suddenly a lot less useful. And you would be right to think that having 2 ways to stop Nib isn't inherently bad, but the thing that I'm really getting at is that there are so many ways to stop Nib now that running it would be a liability, therefore I don't see much use in running Wave High anymore, or Necroquip by proxy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you might think that's also the entire reason I'm not running Lurrie/Tract/Sanct, but you'd actually be wrong, because there's a whole other reason, and it's that they're basically useless. You can make Wave High on top of the current board by just drawing Lacrima or Engraver and tributing/sending them to use the main Azamina combo if you run Agnumday (which I'll get into later, don't worry). AND, on top of that, the Wave High turbo combo makes Wave High as the 6 summon, so if you do that first than you lose a negate because they'll just Nib after you summon Engraver, and the 2nd negate from Wave High is now gone.</p><p>2 - Knightmare Phoenix</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will admit, I have a bit of a grudge with this card. I just don't think it's very helpful a lot of the time, but even I can't deny that it's a good card which is worth running.</p><p>3 - Kashtira engine</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid as hell tbh</p><p>Now that I've gotten that out of the way, it's time for the fun part: The cards that I AM using, when any sane person would say not to.</p><p>1 - Morrian</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get the elephant in the room out of the way, there are a couple reasons behind running Morrian. First off, it's the best card to search with Silvia (I bet you forgot it could do that, didn't you?) and in case you were wondering, yes it does come up, but I will admit that a lot of the times it comes up are going 2nd against another Snake-Eye deck, because 99% of players will use Princess on Silvia right when they get the chance. The 2nd reason is the 2nd effect, because that means it's essentially a free discard to summon Diabellstar since you can get it right back after summoning an Azamina monster, and this card specifically is a very good option for mitigating that cost because of interactions with Debtors that I'll get into later. But as for that 1st effect... it really is quite mediocre, huh?</p><p>2 - Subversion</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, if your starter is Diabellstar (not Seeker) then Poplar has nothing to add when you summon it with Flamberge turn 2, so running another Snake-Eye spell is definitely a good idea. But as for Subversion specifically, it's actually a surprisingly good board breaker, both to draw and to search. And to remind you, it can be searched not only by Poplar, but also by Diabellstar, Rcielago and... well, Rcielago because it's also a Sinful Spoils. You'd really be surprised by how good a very searchable 1 for 1 trade actually is going 2nd, and it's also a good thing to add going 1st if you have extras, because the other option would be something like another Seeker.</p><p>3 - Agnumday</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might think that running Agnumday when I have so little of the rest of the Fiendsmith engine is contradictory, but actually it isn't. If you go through the main Azamina combo that uses 2 discards (which you have to go through if you opened Deception and no other combo), you end up with 2 extra pieces of material and Agnumday is unironically the best thing to use one of them for (the other free material isn't used, in case you were wondering). You can just use a Snake-Eye that you summoned with Flamberge + Sequence to make it, then you just link it away anyways. To be specific about it, the point of Agnumday is that on turn 2 if your opponent outs Desirae, you can use Lacrima to summon Agnumday and then use Agnumday to summon Desirae.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously going into Agnumday isn't always worth it, but if you go first and you draw something like Seeker + Fuwalos + Fuwalos, then you might as well, huh?</p><p>4 - Dominus Impulse (x2)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea behind Impulse is that going 2nd, you can side out Lacrima and Engraver for it. The only things it stops in this deck are Fuwalos and the Fiendsmith engine, so you can just shotgun any Fuwalosses and not go into the Fiendsmith engine, and lets be honest here how often do you go into Desirae going 2nd? You could run something like Nib instead, but that's a lot of risk when this deck doesn't even have 3 Imperm.</p><p>5 - Debtors (x2)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason to run Debtors is to stop Impulse, but it also has a very good use in recycling Silvia on turn 1. It's pretty simple to see the application in chaining Debtors to an Impulse that's chaining to your Hallowed, but Debtors can do so much more than that. For example, the simple way you can use it to recycle Silvia is to send it with Diabellstar and then use the 2nd effect to summon her back. But, the other thing you can do is, instead of using the Hallowed 2nd effect to put back Rcielago then using it to make Silvia, you can use the Debtors to make it instead. Then, if you have to use Silvia on turn 1, you can then use the Hallowed 2nd effect to put back Silvia and use it with a Sinful Spoils in your hand (something like Morrian or Subversion) to get her back, AND you'll also still have the Debtors in GY to get Silvia back on turn 3. Alternitavely, you could just run a 2nd Silvia and then you wouldn't need the Sinful Spoils in hand, and could just use Deception on the opponent's turn.</p><p>6 - Goddess</p><p>WHITE WOMAN JUMPSCARE!</p>"

For the October 2024 version of this deck, I opted to put in ""A Hero Lives"" package with Elemental Hero Prisma for extra gas, since it copies Visas Starfrost's name and from there you can one card combo without even using your normal summon. This version of the strategy also maindecks Mannadium Reframing, a searchable omni-negate counter trap since it helps stave off those pesky boardbreaker spells Tenpai likes using so much. Even if you're not facing Tenpai, Mannadium has a ton of potential to power through established boards and to play through handtraps with its immense boardbuilding ability.<br /><br /><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/masterduel-guide-to-mannadium-december-2023-403015"">If you want a thorough guide on how to play this deck, check out my earlier article!</a><br /><br /><em><strong>Want to see the deck in action!

TRADING CARD GAME, and are at the core of the brand new Geargia Rampage Structure Deck! Geargia cards are versatile and really good: their strategy is based around teamwork and Geargia monsters can Special Summon more Geargia monsters, or add them to your hand for free. Since Geargia monsters are also Machine-Type, you can even use them with other Machine monsters from other Decks to perform some explosive combos. Things only get better for Geargia strategies with the introduction of three new monster cards including a brand new Geargia Xyz Monster that can shut down your opponent&rsquo;s cards during battle. New Duelists can now get their hands on these popular cards while advanced Duelists can support their existing Geargia Decks or other Machine-Type Decks to bolster their strategies.</span></p>"
