It has two main modes an XYZ mode using XYZ universe from the side deck and replacing the ritual cards or the ritual mode adding the two extra advance ritual arts from the side to the main alongside the lone Blue-eyes chaos dragon.

Mystic Mine OTK,"Going second OTK deck built around going second, and then either OTKing or breaking boards with Machina Citadel or Accesscode talker, while setting up Super Dora or  Apollo. The idea is to use Machina Citadel as a powerful recursive boss monster by stacking the GY with them, and then kill in one shot with Liebe. You also have the insane power of using Urgent Schedule to summon Scrap Recycler and Machina Citadel, which going second is an excellent way to break boards with DRNM, particularly with the Knightmares in the extra deck. Crystron Rosenix and Machina Fortress are included as Scrap Recycler targets, and Golem as the Scrap Wyvern Brick (though placing it in attack position on your opponent's field will open up OTKs.) Irradiator and Megaform can help make trains and stack multiple Citadels, and are mostly here because  Machina Redeployment is such a nuts card, and you need more targets. Still, the cards are good and help make trains where you'd have Citadels. Derricrane and Bullet Train are both Obligatory, because trains. Derricrane attached to Super Dora + Apollo is pretty good going first. both have useful side effects, and make rank 10s easily. You only need 1 Knight Express to search out with Switchyard (itself a busted card), at least in the Machina builds. Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede is just here as a Switchyard target, but in a pinch it is a dope normal summon. Rather than run 3 Switchyard, we're running 1 Switchyard, and 2 Mine, with Set Rotation, and Terraforming. You don't need as many copies of Switchyard as Mine, and Mine is basically here to be spell negate bait, though it also opens up easy Train OTKs. Gadarla is run over Jizikiru, who has synergy with the deck, simply because some Dino players are using Simorgh to Barrier Statue lock people. I think Kaijus are really good in trains, and are good right now - Dragoon is outed with 1 Kaiju, and Kaijus help out all kinds of cards you can't destroy (which is one of the things this deck excels at going second. Dark Ruler No More is basically obligatory in a deck that is dedicated going second. Infernoble makes this card a lot worse, but Infernoble's board is relatively easy to break after hand loops, and we can bring in hand traps for that matchup. Lightning Storm is likewise a going second staple, should be pretty obvious what the card is for. Urgent Schedule has fringe benefits going first if you see it alongside Scrap Recycler, adding a Level 10 Machine to your hand when you pop it with Wyvern. Unchained Abomination destroys spells and traps in control matchups, and is good for breaking boards in some instances over Accesscode. I love the card. Genius is some good going second negation, which can help turn off protection, force out negations, and enable board breaking. Pentestage and Underclock Taker are here for enabling OTK's. You don't need Anger Knuckle now that link zones aren't a thing for XYZ monsters."

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Thunder Dragon"" is an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Thunder monsters, used by Psychic Tendo in Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures. Their first member was introduced in the Vol.7 Booster Pack, while their first support was introduced in Soul Fusion. The general design and effect of each ""Thunder Dragon"" monster is based on and inspired by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", all of them being electrified dragons with a green, yellow, black or gray color scheme. ""Thunder Dragon Titan"" is especially influenced by the original ""Thunder Dragon"", which looks like a three-headed version of that monster, similar to the design of ""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"". ""Thunder Dragondark"" is a directly retrained version of the original ""Thunder Dragon"" as it has the same Type, Level, ATK, DEF, opposite Attribute, and similar effect of searching another copy of itself.

What a better way to bring out the excitement by expressing the horrifying fear that comes along before getting all the candy? Be prepared to join on this thrill ride of virtual trick-or-treating YuGiOh style!

First off, you can't go trick-or-treating without the perfect costume! Well, I've got you covered with options for everyone! There's the traditional superhero so Hero Kid is the perfect emphasis that shows every kid's dream to be their favorite superhero. Perhaps,  Disney princesses are more your thing so Cinderella has got you covered as well! But maybe superheroes and princesses are not your thing, perhaps you want to spice it up by throwing in your Sci-Fi favorites! The Kozmo series gives many options if you're a Star Wars fan and Mandalorian season 2 is right around the corner so #hyped. Jedi? Sith? Stormtrooper? Whatever you want! Lastly, this is a YuGiOh Halloween contest after all so the classics are here too, Dark Magician... Dark Magician Girl... even the robe and rod is offered for a build your own Dark magician costume! Kaibaman is there too for all our Seto Kaiba fans because let's be honest, Kaiba &gt; Yugi. Remember to bring your pumpkin!

You've picked your Halloween costume and you're prepared to go trick-or-treating. Well, it's not going to be your usual travelling door-to-door as the Ghostrick are here to give you that frightful fear as you progress through the night. Will you be brave enough to get through Stein? Ghoul? But don't worry because not everything Ghostrick is there to spook you as the Ghostrick Fairy is there to keep you on your feet!

If you've managed to get past the trials of the Ghostricks, you're one step closer to getting the candy! But first, you've reached the haunted mansion of Toon World. Do you dare to go inside? Of course! As the creeped door opens, you find yourself uneased but you have to keep pushing forward for that candy! Welcomed by the ghost of Shadow Toon as it follows you wherever you go, the creeping skull heads jump you for that sudden surprised! Of course, in the world of Toon World, Toon Summoned Skull will be the master of disguise behind these trickery. You don't know where it is but it could out any moment so be prepared! However, we're brave and nothing will stop us from getting our candy. We continue onwards and we see the Lady in Wight, Jack-o-bolan, Saggy the clown but it hasn't been too bad. Hey, this haunted house isn't as bad as the author puts it as! You prepare to exit through the door to the outside when you least realize it, the Toon Summoned Skull pops out from its shadows and drags you into the depths of the graveyard...

Into the graveyard, we see the lost souls of the victims to the Toon Summoned Skull. The grim reaper guards the lost souls from ever escaping.. is your life doomed? Are you stuck here without ever getting that candy? I guess that's it then.

...

...

...

But wait there is one way out! The Ghostrick fairy who's stuck alongside with you this whole time to keep you from giving up has come to bless you with the chance at revival. With such bravery shown so far and never giving up, the fairy is impressed at your strong will and grants you the ""Call of the Haunted' allowing your escape. Unfortunately, as you leave though, the Ghostrick fairy has to bid you goodbye, having to stay behind in the graveyard as the call can only grant the escape of one being and the fairy has been searching for the ""one"" which is you.

Thankfully, with the Ghostrick fairy at your side, you managed to survive this Halloween adventure. Sadly, at the cost of the fairy though, but her sacrifice was necessary to save you. The Pot of Avarice congratulates you on your survival and grants you all the candy for you to enjoy even a Chocolate-a-la-mode! Though, the powers of the Pot gives you the chance to call back another from the graveyard but at the cost of no candy. Do you give up your candy treat to revive the Ghostrick fairy? The decision is yours."

I guess so,"&nbsp;

Been playing around and made a few changes to my previous iterations of this deck to what is the most competitive version yet.

Dragoon is the goal of the deck, sometimes it can feel like Dragoon or bust, but most of the time it’s VERY possible to get into Dragoon and even with a Flare Metal and/or disruption. Dragoon is almost always live but you don’t need him to stick. With Soul Servant, you can play a very consistent Dark Magician grind game until you can push for game.

Added dragon’s mirror because it’s cute with dragon knight and borreload furious. I might cut it, but I’ve been liking it so far, at the very least it’s way better than poly."

&nbsp;

Myutant Nemeses V1.

&nbsp;

This deck is central around the Myutant archtype and designed to get access to Myutant Ultimas asap

&nbsp;

The deck plays well with Nemeses as you can see Myutants offer different types and attributes to help bring the boss monsters out if needed.

The Nemeses monsters offer good type and attribute removal if against any themed decks or types.

It is fun to play and is competitive and once i revamp the deck more and more it will be viable in tournaments."

","The Dogmatika archetype is an archetype that is against the extra deck, since they send cards from the extra deck to have effects, and they lock the player out of the extra deck. This archtype can be meshed into most decks usually invoked, or even buster blader more recently. Today I am testing it with Dinosaurs, and I find that it works pretty well. The strategy is to do all of your dinosaur combos, then do the dogmatika stuff to get a even more powerful board. Typically if you open Miscellaneousaurus, Babycerasaurus, and Nadir Servant, you end on Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, Evolzar Dolkka,  Dogmatika Ecclesia The Virtuous, Dogmatika Fleur De Lis, and a set Dogmatika Punishment. Side deck is self preference.

The ""U.A."" archetype is based on various pop culture references regarding ""Future Sports"", mixing a solid amount of already existing sports in one giant mash-up (even including race cars since some of the newer ""U.A."" support also counts as ""F.A.""). During the game, they are played as a Hybrid deck, being a mix of both beatdown and aggro strategies while also allowing field control via negates when it counts. To allow such a smooth transition, all ""U.A."" monsters (except one) can Special summon themselves by returning an ""U.A."" monster to the hand, giving you the option of attacking normally during your Battle Phase only to switch your monster line-up during Main Phase 2 to have disruption ready during the opposing turn.</p>
<p>The monsters are almost entirely from the ""U.A."" archetype, except for the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"", who I run for the obvious negation via handtrap; ""U.A.s"" have a good amount of consistency boosters and do not really lose any tempo by putting a few handtraps in, so run whatever option you either deem is the best or, alternatively, the most budget-friendly. The ""U.A."" core consists of three copies of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Midfielder"">U.A. Midfielder</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a>"", who both have solid switch effects to be able to even switch out monsters during the opposing turn, but I cannot stress enough that they are also there to provide non-tribute Normal Summons, something which the archetype was and to a certain extend still has problems with. Without a monster on board, you cannot start the switching schenanigans, which will leave you with quite a few bricks in form of monster cards. Talking about switching, the options you can go into are two ""<a data-name=""U.A. Perfect Ace"">U.A. Perfect Ace</a>"" who negates a card for discarding one from your hand, a copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker"">U.A. Blockbacker</a>"" who can switch the position and then negate the effect of a Special summoned monster, a copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Mighty Slugger"">U.A. Mighty Slugger</a>"" who works like a ""U.A."" version of an ""Ancient Gear"" monster and therefore prohibits the opponent from activating stuff during his attack and two copies of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>"" sporting both piercing damage and destroying a card whenever he is able to inflict damage to the opponent.</p>
<p>The last monster in the deck is ""<a data-name=""U.A. Playing Manager"">U.A. Playing Manager</a>"", played at three copies (although you could lower the ratio to two if necessary). This card is a beast, because he can Special summon himself when a switch is happening, giving you some swarming and an additional beater. But whenever he is Special summoned, he can decide whether he wants to destroy a card on the field or negate the effects of all non-""U.A."" monsters, which is even better. He is easy to recycle, since you can simply bounce him to your hand as cost, Special summon another ""U.A."" monster, then bring him back in because his summon effect triggers, giving you another activation of his effects if he has no use them during that turn. And with the help of the Level 4 monsters, you can even switch him out and bring him back in during the opposing turn, even giving you another disruptive option.</p>
<p>The Spell/Trap line-up has various staples that you will find in other ""U.A."" decklists aswell; simply because those cards are that useful. Both ""<a data-name=""U.A. Hyper Stadium"">U.A. Hyper Stadium</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" are played at three copies, giving you a solid amount of helpful effects which could look something like this: Play ""<a data-name=""U.A. Hyper Stadium"">U.A. Hyper Stadium</a>"", search a Level 4 monster via its effect, use the second effect to reveal a ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" in your hand to gain an additional Normal Summon for the turn, play ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"" from your hand, Normal summon the searched Level 4 monster giving you another search via the first effect of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>"", play another Level 4 monster via Normal summon (either because it was already in your hand or because you searched it with ""<a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium</a>'s"" effect) to gain another search into a high-level monster and continue from there. The Field Spells are crazy useful and the ratio works fine in my mind. I even run one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" to get the missing piece more often. The three copies of ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"" are mostly for ditching ""<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a>"", which can search a ""U.A."" Spell card when banished from the graveyard, giving you yet another searcher for the Field Spells or for the single copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Powered Jersey"">U.A. Powered Jersey</a>"", which in combination with ""<a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>"" can end games rather consistently. ""<a data-name=""U.A. Signing Deal"">U.A. Signing Deal</a>"" is both a playstarter, since it puts a monster on the field, as well as a search option because you can easily bounce the card and then resummon it with its effects activatable; the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" serves a similar purpose. The deck works very well without touching the Extra Deck, therefore the maximum amount of ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" serve as very solid draw options. The generic rest is one ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" to search for the Level 4 guys and therefore get them into my hand more consistently, which allows different searches via the Field Spell line-up and one ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" against opposing backrow. One argument that I have encountered against ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" is that you always have to discard a card, which can be pretty damaging to ""U.A."" but I do like to have the option of getting rid of a potential copy of ""<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a>"" in my hand; but feel free to run a different backrow removal.</p>
<p>The Extra Deck, as is often the case, mostly features options for various situations in the game. ""<a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>"" makes Field Spells reuseable, ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" can be used to push a little harder since the entire ""U.A."" line-up is Earth Attribute, the ""Knightmares"" are well-known and provide various removal effects, ""<a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a>"" can be used to search but will often not be necessary, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is a counter option against graveyard-heavy decks, ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" can serve as a field reset, ""<a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" brings non-destruction removal, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" is another anti-backrow option, ""<a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">Number 61: Volcasaurus</a>"" can sometimes be used to burn for game, ""<a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>"" can steal monsters from the opponent which clears the field of one monster to get over while also providing you with another attacker, ""<a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>"" provides tokens and further removal and ""<a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>"" will bring Spell negation. Similar to the ""B.E.S."" deck I posted a while ago, ""U.A.s"" are not really in need of summoning any of those cards, but it is nice to have the option instead of leaving the Extra Deck empty (which would be a bad choice anyway due to ""Pot of Extravagance"").</p>
<p>There are two deckbuilding details I want to mention still: Some decks run as little of the ""U.A."" monsters as possible, potentially running only one copy of every high-level monster because they are easily searchable and accessable. That is a valid strategy and can be played as such, I simply wanted to have the option to still have some of my playmakers after losing one to destruction effects or being forced to discard them. Pick whatever approach seems best in your mind. Number two is about the Extra Deck: Since ""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" banishes six cards, there are decks that run about five Extra Deck monsters at maximum copy count to increase the chance of still having copies of everything after banishing. This is also a solid approach to take, the only thing you need to ask yourself in order to find out what is best in your deck is whether you like a plethora of options pre-""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"" or if you want access to all of the card post-""<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>"". Those are only some pointers I found noteworthy when building the deck.</p>
<p>""U.A."" is certainly a quite unique and powerful deck to play. The option of turning an Aggro-board into a disruptive wall is both strong in-game and fun to pull off. If you are interested in the rest of the ""U.A."" archetype and want to read my opinion on all things ""U.A."", you can visit my blog, where I recently posted a ""U.A."" archetype analysis, here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/20/archetype-analysis-u-a/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/20/archetype-analysis-u-a/</a></p>"

Jar and Pot are potential bricks, added to clear graveyard of either non-madolches to help the princesses activate or recycle useful spells and links

Aimed for generic and accessible; a good pick for locals, with a couple tech picks to compensate for a lack of hand traps

-Trap hole suite with Traptrix. With called at 1, this helps pick up a bit of slack in defensive responses outside of queen's spin

-xyz import combos nicely with gameciel, pops problematic monsters while refreshing on board XYZs

-side deck is a work in progress. More then likely will cover the standard triple impermance and evenly matched, if budget allows. Looking for feedback on any other meta relevant picks that don't clog the hand or graveyard"

Don't ask. Anyway, here we have a slow Phantom Knights deck, focused on slowing the opponent with us with the use of our traps. And yes, we're running Mystic Mine. Yes, I betrayed all of my morals. Anyway, onto the deck guide.
We have the core Phantom Knights cards, with the main monsters. We have:
3 Ragged Gloves, for a extra 1000 buff (which is permanent) and, you can banish it from your GY to send a ragged cloak to search out a Boots
3 Anchient Cloak, which can buff another monster but that's never used, unless you're in a tight position. It's best to send it to the graveyard and then banish it to search a Boots or Gloves to your hand, or if you don't need to summon any more monsters, a fog blade to fuck around and find out.
3 Silent Boots, which easily special summons itself out for a rank 3. Staple card, and it can also banish itself to search out a Fog Blade or whatever else you need
Now, we have the Phantom Knights spells/traps
1 Phantom Knight's Spear, for protection in the GY and extra burn damage
2 Phantom Knight's Rank Up Magic Launch, for when you have a XYZ monsters with no materials left
2 Raider's Unbreakable Mind, to get a free destruction if you rank up.
3 Fog Blade because... It's Fog Blade. I don't need to explain this.
1 Phantom Knight's Sword, for an extra 800 buff for an OTK finish.
1 The Phantom Knights's of Dark Gauntlets, for sending Spear and other good spells/traps to the GY that you want in the GY
2 Vambrace, which is great for slowing down the opponent and protecting your monsters.
3 Raidraptor- Phantom Knight's Claw, which is a great negation for when you have XYZ monsters on the field
2 Mist Claws, which can recycle more recources for extra plays.
1 Shade Briganade, to stall out an attack
Misc. main deck cards
1 Tschukinoko, which special summons itself easily, gets a draw, and can discard a card you'd want in the GY (although it's random, so it might discard something you want to save)
1 Jackalope, same with the above
3 Ash Blossoms, ez negate, gg bro
2 Ghost Ogre, understandable have a nice format
3 Allure of Darkness, strong draw power
3 Mystic Mine, to slow down the opponent, especially if it's a swarm deck like most decks in the meta rn.  I hate myself for this
1 Lost Wind, cripples the opponent's boss monster
Hee hee, extra deck go brrrr
1 Rusty Bardiche, Rusty Bardiche is really good if you have a hand for spamming  out enough monsters for a link-3 and getting out another XYZ. Can also search out a Fog Blade and shit easily
1 Megaclops, good for late game, in case I grind out 3 XYZ monsters (have done that before when testing this)
1 Raider's Knight, can be summoned if you special summon monsters off of Break Sword's destruction effect
2 Break Sword, the monster you wanna summon first with Ragged Gloves, to get a 3k beater with a destruction effect
1 Dante, an alternative rank 3 in case you run out of or lose your Break Swords, with a great mill for extra resources
1 Utopia, for a Rank 4 in case Break Sword is destroyed
1 Utopia the Lightning, to rank up Utopia from
It do be a side deck doe
3 Nibiru, to completely counter decks that summon 5 or more monsters.
1 Pankratops, for going second and to get an easy pop
3 Gamaciel, in case your opponent runs strong monsters you can't beat over normally
1 Mind Control, for easy stealing when going 2nd
1 Raigeki, to break your opponent's board when going 2nd
1 weird book thing, to slow down the opponent's plays
I hate myself for making this, have a good day. Any suggestions are appreciated"

<span>This deck aims to use Chaos Thunder Dragon's swarm abilities to put up enough link material in order to set up the field with enough link material to make a Simorgh Bird of Sovereignty, Union Carrier and a Thunder Dragon Titan. In case you do not know how infinite negates work, Simorgh summons Mist Valley Apex Avian from the deck with it's effect during the end phase, and Carrier equips Mist Valley Thunderbird to your Simorgh. Apex Avian can negate an opponent's card effect by bouncing a 'Mist Valley' card you control back to the hand and Thunderbird can summon itself when it returns to the hand, neither effect being once per turn. So you can infinitely negate your opponent's card effects by using Avian to bounce back Thunderbird and Thunderbird summoning itself. If your opponent attempts to attack over Thunderbird you can just 'chain titan eff' to pop the monster you are attacking with, further boosted by the fact that Thunderbird is a thunder-type monster, so it also triggers titan's effect.This is of course susceptible to Dark Ruler No More, Forbidden Droplets, Kaiju's, any quick effect card that can negate as chain link 3 (Imperm, chalice, gamma, etc) and super poly (after baiting a negate). There are probably others I missed, but apart from that you can't really bait these negates nor realistically play through them.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>CHAOS THUNDER DRAGON GUIDE
</span><span>For unfamiliar people, Chaos Thunder Dragon is a strategy where the 'Chaos' part refers to monsters that can special summon themselves by banishing monsters of a specific attribute (usually LIGHT and/or DARK). Next comes the 'Thunder Dragon' part. These are cards that gain effects either by discarding them or them being sent from the field to the GY or getting banished (The effect gained by being banished is the same as the one gained by being sent to the field to the GY) and since they are all LIGHT or DARK, they synergise pretty well with the Chaos engine. Some notable cards include Thunder Dragonroar, who can summon another 'Thunder Dragon' monster from the deck if banished, Thunder Dragondark, who can search any 'Thunder Dragon' card when banished, Black Dragon Collapserpent and White Dragon Wyverbuster who can summon themselves by banishing a LIGHT and DARK (respectively) from the graveyard and can search the other monster if sent to the GY and The Chaos Creator, who banishes a LIGHT and DARK to summon itself and can summon back a banished monster, along with recurring other banished monsters.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>OTHER NOTABLE CARDS
Dark Beckoning Beast/Opening of the Spirit Gates: Opening either one of them can lead to a 1 card 'Curios, The Lightsworn Dominion' who can set up your graveyard. I won't tell the combo here, so I recommend searching up '1-card curious' on Google or Youtube.



Apart from a few cards, which are mainly techs or staples that aren't necessarily required for the deck to function, i would say the deck is relatively semi-budget, clocking in at the 100-150 euro range, so it's definitely a fun deck to try out. It doesn't necessarily have any 'combos' per say, as it really does come down to the hand you draw and it is very open-ended.</span>"

Main Attribute, Type: Earth, Rock

The main focus of the deck is to go first and either end on one of your Extra Deck monsters with protection effects (Nephthys, Bagooska, Crumble Logos) or some form of interruption with your Megaliths (Aratron, Phul (quick effect into Bethor), and Och (quick effect into Chaos MAX)).  Then on the following turn, utilize Fossil Fusion, Megalith Phaleg, and Gaia Plate to help put high attack rock monsters on the field and attempt to OTK. Ideally, Megalith Bethor has already cleared most of your opponent's field at this point so that your OTK enablers can attack directly. 1 Megalith Portal and 3 Doki Doki can be replaced for other cards depending on personal preference (consistency boosters are highly recommended). The Impcantation engine can be used to boost consistency but be careful as the engine is counter-intuitive to the Fossil strategy by locking you out of your extra deck."

Shien's Spy can also be used to hand off one of your ritual monsters for Chaos Max to swing into, since they also have 0 DEF. On top of this, you can just hand off the only Impcantation on your field (besides Chalislime) so you can unlock your Extra Deck until the end of the turn.

If you draw a BEWD, it helps to discard it with Trade-in or Chalislime so you can just banish it with Chaos Form, or use 2 Impcantations to tribute summon it then XYZ with another level 8 into Draglubion. I recommend summoning Neo-Galaxy Eyes with its effect.

Normally the best/easiest card to ritual summon with it Advanced Ritual art, especially for the non-MAX Dragon.

Make sure to ALWAYS ritual non-MAX with a BEWD, so you can use its effect which helps you beat over big monsters.

Happy Summoning!"

<strong>Introduction</strong>

With the release of Phantom Rage around the corner, I figured some people might be looking for how to use the new Melffy support card or perhaps interested in a more unique Tri-Brigade variant than Zoo. This is the most up to date version of the Melffy Tri-Brigade deck that I have been toying with over the past couple of months.

<strong>General Deck Theory:</strong>

The Melffy engine generates plenty of advantage and interaction off of their one card starters, but lacks ways to push damage and affect the board on their own turn. This is where the aggressive Tri-Brigade sub-engine, <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, and <em>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</em> come into play, as they all provide big bodies and effects that chew through the opponent's field. Also, given that Melffy play off of 1 card starters, we are free to include a generous helping of handtraps (13!). Combined with the instant board breaker <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, it reasons that going second is not necessarily a death warrant for this deck, even against combo. However, this is still a blind first deck, as we would prefer to set up our wall of Melffy advantage before the opponent gets on board.

<strong>Common Opening Lines:</strong>

Note: When I refer to a ""pop,"" I am referring to an effect that destroys an opponent's card, in this case at quick effect timing.

Obedience Schooled = 2 pops + 1 search for follow up or negation

Activate <em>Obedience Schooled</em> to summon <em>Kalantosa Mystical Beast of the Forest, Melffy Puppy</em>, and  <em>Melffy Catty</em>. Overlay the 3 Level 2 Beasts into <em>Excited Melffys.</em> On the opponent's turn, use <em>Excited Melffys </em>to resummon the 3 Level 2 beasts, which will no longer have their effects negated. <em>Kalontosa</em> will pop a card when it is resummoned, <em>Puppy</em> can summon another <em>Kalantosa</em> from deck, and <em>Catty</em> can search for a follow up play, like <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>, or it can search <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> to immediately summon a <em>Herald of the Arclight</em> on the opponent's turn. Be very careful to not search <em>Hop Ear</em> when the opponent can already run over <em>Herald</em> in battle, as wasting the search can be costly, especially if you have no follow up.

Rescue Cat = 2 pops

Activate <em>Rescue Cat</em> to summon <em>Kalantosa </em>and <em>Melffy Puppy. </em>Similar to the last opening, we overlay these 2 Beasts into <em>Excited Melffys</em>, which can bring back the 2 Beasts without their effects negated.

Nimble Beaver = 1 pop and 1 conditional negation

Activate <em>Nimble Beaver</em>'s effect on summon to summon another copy from the deck. Overlay the <em>Nimble Beavers </em>into <em>Melffy of the Forest</em>. Activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to search <em>Melffy Puppy</em>, or, if you have a copy in hand already, search <em>Melffy Cat. </em>Assuming we only end with <em>Puppy </em>in hand, summon it in the End Phase using its own effect. During the opponent's turn, when <em>Puppy</em> returns to the hand to summon <em>Kalantosa</em> from deck, you can activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to negate one monster permanently and prevent it from attacking. This negation is rather situational, since it only triggers  exactly right after a Melffy returns to hand and thus cannot stop on summon effects, but it is important to know that it is there.

Rescue Cat/Nimble Beaver + Tri-Brigade Airborne = 1 Banish + 1 Pop + 1 or 2 Floating Effects (effects that search when the monster is sent to GY)

Activate Rescue Cat to summon two <em>Melffy Puppy</em>s from deck or <em>Nimble Beaver</em> to summon a copy of itself from deck. Overlay the two Level 2 monsters for <em>Melffy of the Forest.</em> Activate <em>Melffy of the Forest</em>  to search <em>Melffy Puppy</em>, or, if you have a copy in hand already, search <em>Melffy Catty</em>. Now, activate <em>Tri-Brigade Airborne</em> <em>Assault</em> by targeting <em>Melffy of the Forest</em> to summon <em>Tri-Brigade Nervall </em>from deck. Link Summon <em>Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</em> using <em>Forest</em> and <i>Nervall </i>as material. Since it was sent to the GY, activate <i>Nervall</i>'s effect to search <i>Kerass </i>from deck. Next, activate <em>Ferrijit</em>'s effect to summon <i>Kerass </i>from hand. There will now be 4 or 5 monsters in the GY at this point, depending on which starter you opened with. Either way, activate <i>Kerass </i>and banish 4 cards from the GY to summon <em>Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen.</em> If there are 5 cards in GY, avoid banishing <em>Nervall</em>. Lastly, Link Summon <em>Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller</em> using <em>Ferrijit </em>and <i>Kerass </i>as Material. When <em>Ferrijit </em>is sent to GY, you get a small redraw to fix the hand. During the End Phase, summon from hand the <em>Melffy Puppy</em> that we searched earlier. During the opponents turn, we can resummon <i>Kerass </i>or <i>Nervall </i>(better because it floats) using <em>Rugal </em>to trigger the banish effect of <em>Shuraig </em>at any time during the Main Phase and we can pop a card with <em>Kalantosa</em> off <em>Puppy</em>. <em>Shuraig </em>also floats into almost any card in our deck, because why not.

<strong>Card Choice Discussion</strong>

I don't claim to be an expert deck builder or believe that I have completely broken the meta with this semi-casual Melffy deck. I do, however, believe that I have put enough thought and experimentation into this deck to justify every inclusion and exclusion, with room for disagreement. Below, I talk about some deck build choices that may be surprising or flat out incorrect to many people.

Why no <em>Simorgh </em>with <em>Barrier Statue</em> or Mist Valley Infinite Negates?
<ul>
 	<li>They aren't fun. The great thing about Melffy is that you are slowly building up advantage while interacting with your opponent in a very careful and meaningful way. Building the deck around setting up one of these locks removes all of that complexity and strips Melffy of its unique identity and strengths.</li>
</ul>
The Tri-Brigade ratio seems weird. You should be playing <em>Fraktall</em>, he's the best one to open with.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Fraktall</em> sends <em>Nervall</em>, who searches <em>Kerass</em>. With the discard from <em>Kerass</em>, you have 3 cards in GY. Now you banish them all to summon the Link 3 <em>Rugal</em>. You can even link off what you have into <em>Shuraig</em>. Now what? You used 2 cards in hand to end on a big guy that sits there and floats. In short, <em>Fraktall</em> is not a starter.</li>
 	<li><em>Airborne Assault</em> is clearly not a starter either, so why play it over <em>Fraktall</em>? Well, as an extender, it's just pound for pound better card advantage than <em>Fraktall</em>. It summons <em>Nervall</em> from deck, who then gives you a +1 when used as material. Meanwhile, when you send <em>Nervall</em> to GY with <em>Fraktall</em> and search a Tri-Brigade monster, you only go neutral in terms of card economy</li>
</ul>
1 <em>D.D. Crow</em>?
<ul>
 	<li>The <em>D.D. Crow</em> is included strictly in lieu of playing a second <em>Nervall</em>, which is not great to draw. <em>Crow</em> is more of an engine piece that doubles as a handtrap. In the combo I mentioned earlier with <em>Rescue Cat</em>/<em>Nimble Beaver</em> + <em>Airborne Assault</em>, if you draw both your 1 <em>Nervall</em> and an <em>Airborne Assault</em>, then you use <em>Airborne</em> to summon <em>D.D. Crow</em> from the deck, Link Summon into <em>Ferrijit</em>, and summon from hand the <em>Nervall</em> that you opened with. You still have 4 or 5 cards in GY to banish for <em>Nerval's</em> effect, so the rest is the same.</li>
</ul>
<em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> kind of sucks...
<ul>
 	<li>I agree. 80% of the games I would rather search a more impactful and less risky card with <em>Catty</em>. However, those 20% of games where we pop their normal summon and can successfully <em>Herald</em> negate their next play make the 1 of <em>Hop Ear</em> better than playing a single extra handtrap. Also, a funny play going second is to <em>Gamma</em> the opponent on their turn and immediately use the <em>Driver</em> on field and <em>Hop Ear</em> to summon <em>Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</em> (or <em>Psyframelord Omega</em>, both have merit).</li>
</ul>
Why so little Melffy cards? They're all searchable, you know.
<ul>
 	<li>The other Melffy cards are mediocre to bad. <em>Melffy Pony</em> is reasonable, but it relies on you already being extremely set up and your GY is often taxed by the Tri-Brigade already. If Pony could recycle <em>Rescue Cat</em>, my opinion of it might be higher, but often the only Level 2 beast in GY is <em>Kalantosa</em>.  Now that <em>Excited Melffy</em>, which wants all of it's materials intact, is our go to Melffy XYZ, <em>Melffy Playhouse</em> doesn't play well with our opening board. Bringing back one Melffy with <em>Melffy Tag</em> does not push any significant plays through, and if we really want to get a Melffy back in rotation, we can just use <em>Excited Melffy</em>. <em>Melffy Hide-and-Seek</em> is a slow <em>Upstart Goblin</em> that conflicts with the Tri-Brigades' GY resource usage. <em>Melffy Mommy</em> and <em>Melffy Fenny</em> I won't go over because just glancing the card text, it's evident they do nothing. Overall, I would nearly always rather search either <em>Melffy Puppy</em> or <em>Melffy Catty</em> over any of the cards I mentioned.</li>
</ul>
If this is a go first deck, why play 3 <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts? </em>You could just play 1 and search it with <em>Catty</em>.
<ul>
 	<li>The card is just that powerful. Going second, it is the best card in the deck. Going first, it ensures that you have a follow up to control the board. All of your duels are going to be grindy because of the Melffy playstyle, so having access to beater that can preserve itself by returning to hand will always impact the duel. Given the low attack of Melffy, you can freely summon this card, even on the third turn with monsters on your field. It doesn't hurt that it has synergy with <em>Rescue Cat</em> and <em>Obedience Schooled</em> in bouncing back the negated cards they summon. For example, you can access the Tribrigade engine by summoning <em>Kerass</em> off of <em>Rescue Cat</em>, bouncing it to hand, and then Special Summoning the <em>Kerass</em> from hand. Additionally, you can bounce back some Melffy summoned off <em>Obedience Schooled</em>, who will then summon themselves back from the hand.</li>
</ul>

What you want for a hand is either  <span>Pahunder </span><span>Mahunder</span>

These will help you summon more level 4 monsters like sishunder or brohunder

If you can try to summon Pahunder then Mahunder via Pahunder effect to get 3 monsters on the field.

Spirit converter or any other spells that add other overlay can be very usefull on cards like Utopia kasier or Thunder spark dragon

Thunder dragon with 5 overlay units can wipe your opponets board.

Utopia kasier is the main monster you want on the field. Keep add overlay units on to it because the more overlay units with different names. Kaiser summons Rank 9 or lower monnsters with 3000 Attack or less but there effect are negated and you do half the battle dmg that turn.

Sorry if this is long and you can even move and get rid of cards if you want. Also you can comment to give me feedback which helps me learn

Since the release of Phantom Rage on August 8, 2020, Phantom Knights quickly came back from the dead in the competitive scene. The new support cards is the main reason on why this deck is back: with Tear Scale having multiple effect that gives the user a huge advantage, it's also one of the key cards to complete the combo, also let's not forget about Raiders' Knight and Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon, this 2 cards is the card you need in order to OTK your opponent. This deck can run a ton of extenders while still having space for handtraps and anti-handtraps card, that's why i can safely say that this deck is BROKEN. When building this deck, I really want to add the level 3 Danger! monsters here since it's always plus card even if it's discarded, I know that it's not common to run Dangers! when you have handtraps and anti-handtraps card, but I want this build to be unique and fit my playstyle so I've added it.

&nbsp;

Do not take this to a competitive event since you will lose unless your luck is unbeatable. Use cards like  Time Wizard to wipe all of your opponents monster off the field at once, or one at a time with Snipe Hunter. For the Battle Phase there are cards like Sasuke Samurai #4 to destroy cards before the Damage step or Fairy Box to reduce your opponent monster's attack to zero. These cards and more with a little of luck will lead your way to victory. Again don forget this is just a fun causal deck that 99% of the time will not will at locals."
