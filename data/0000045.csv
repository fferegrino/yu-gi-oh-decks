Dragon and Blue Eyes White Dragon, which are kind of opposites.  Idea of this deck came after seeing and using Return of the Red-Eyes, which is a card in the Red Eyes deck to make your Red Eyes B. Dragon return from the GY but I noticed that for some reason it also allowed level 8 monsters to be returned. Realizing that Blue Eyes White Dragon is a level 8,  thought why not?  There's not much special in this deck, no new combos but it's fun to play. The generic combos are used in this deck, but I'll write them below anyways: <ol>  	<li>If you have a BEWD (Blue Eyes White Dragon) in your hand, use Melody of Awakening Dragon to bring BEWD Alternative and Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon to hand, SS BEWD Alt., Remove an opponent monster, then normal summon the Odd Eyes and you can take down another one while dealing damage. Just hope there's no Bottomless trap hole or anything else in the opponent's trap zone. Odd-Eyes Advance is pretty useful.</li>  	<li>I added a kaiju in there for removing any annoying cards in the opponents field like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon (more annoying if it's summoned by a windwitch effect)</li>  	<li>Kidmodo gets useful, especially is you use dragon shrine to get rid of it from the deck and since it's in the GY it's effect activates and you can SS a Blue Eyes from your hand.</li>  	<li>Use the Black Stone of Legend to summon a REBD (Red-Eyes B. Dragon) and then summon an Alternative from your hand, do this cause a) It has the same attack so there's no difference, b) If something like Raigeki or Mirror Force or something comes you can SS REBD with double the attack, 4800 is a lot of attack.</li>  	<li>Keeper of the Shrine is just useful in a dragon deck.</li>  	<li>I added Lightning Vortex cause it was useful to get a lot of cards like Red-Eyes Wyvern, Clear Kuriboh, The White Stone of the Ancients, etc. in the GY, it also clears your opponent's field so two birds with one stone.</li>  	<li>Back to the Front (Return to the Frontlines) is good if you have a BEWD in the GY and one on the field, so you can xyz summon a Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon and then move on to Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon after that. If it gets destroyed then bring out Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon and summon Galaxy-Eyes Full Armour Photon Dragon and detach a material to get rid of a monster on the field (preferably the one who sent Cipher blade dragon to the GY). Galaxy-Eyes Tachiyon Dragon is good for monsters that are buffed and have their attacks increased. Choose to bring out either Tachiyon or Cipher dragons wisely as the situation may demand it.</li>  	<li> I put Deck Devastation Virus especially because of the fact that we can bring out REBD easily using Return of the Red-Eyes or Return of the Dragon Lords or the Black Stone of Legend and sacrifice that for activating this card. Return of the Red-Eyes can easily bring it out again.</li>  	<li>A Wild Monster Appears! was added because of all the times I got frustrated losing just because I had only a BEWD Alt. and nothing else in my hand, so i can't SS it and just end up taking battle damage. The card allows it to stay for a fairly long time so you can use to bring out BEWD Alt. and buy some time to get a game changer card like Return of the Dragon Lords or One Day of Peace which buy more time.</li>  	<li>One for One was useful as it just summoned Black Stone of Legend on my first turn which allowed an instant REBD on the field, or a Red-Eyes Baby Dragon if I want to buy some time for a better card next turn or if the opponent has too many monsters on the field.</li>  	<li>Unhappy Maiden because a) Easily allows a one turn survival against most decks, b) I honestly just like the card.</li>  	<li>I put ""First of the Dragons"" in the Side deck because it's honestly a good card but most decks run cards that just remove cards by effects so it wouldn't be of much help.</li> </ol> If anyone has any better cards to improve/add better combos, do inform me. Also, if anyone has any good DARK tuner that allows me to synchro Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons please help, it's a favorite of mine.  This deck was made just as an experiment to see how well I could combine the two archetypes famous in the old days inspired by Return of the Red-Eyes. It won't stand much of a chance against the more powerful meta decks like altergeist, but it has a chance against Cyber Dragons depending on your hand and how well you play it. This deck can alone clear all the computer decks in the YGOPRO: The Dawn Of A New Era game in the vs DuelTek 760 and also stands against most decks in the vs Dueling Robot.  Edit:  I messed up and forgot to put Red Eyes Alternative in the deck, it's there now.  I added ""Lair of Darkness"" in the deck for three reasons, the first one being that IO actually forgot to the first time. The second being, if you combine it with Deck Devastation Virus (DDV), you can sacrifice any monster the opponent has (Over 2000 attack, and it's a dark monster now, so no worries even if it's originally a light or fire or whatever) for DDV, removing a monster from the opponents field and also now any monster below 1500 attack from their hand.  Third reason, since every monster on the field is now a dark monster, you finally have a dark tuner, meaning you can finally summon Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons! I've wanted to add this card for a long time for the sole reason that this card alone can rival and single-handedly take down a pure Blue Eyes white Dragon deck. Since no card effects can destroy it, BEWD Alternative is useless, and any xyz monster like Galaxy Eyes Cipher Blade or Full Armour can't destroy it, and even if they attack for damage, you'll take the damage once and that value will get added to Beelze's attack, just making it stronger than before. In a pure BEWD deck like in the single player, nothing i've seen in that deck can take this down, but just to be on the safe side, destroy all the annoying monsters first.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Try doing it on your opponent's turn~,"The main deal with the strategy is simple. The go to is to get down crystron needle fiber, then depending on whether you got a level 2 in the banish or level 3 in the grave, you wanna choose crystron rion for the SS (if you have crystron prasiortle banished) or crystron citree for the SS (if you have a level 3 in grave) with crystron needlefiber. The wait for your opponent's turn. When it's their turn you can wait for when they special summon a monster, but if you dont wanna just use rion's/ citree's effect to synchro summon into crystron ametrix, then chain with needlefiber after you summon him to special summon crystron quandax. Now before your opponent ends their turn use quandax to synchro summon with ametrix to get Crystron Phoenix. Now it's your turn. Now you wanna summon a crystron non-tuner monster. Then use their effect to pop rosenix then SS a tuner that'll add up to 5 with the monster you summoned ( so with smiger get citree, with prasiortle get rion), then chain with rosenix to revive crystron quandax in your GY.Now use all your monsters to get Crystron Quariongandrax and bam! The boss monster is out."

Side deck options will vary greatly depending on your match-ups, so tweak the side deck to suit your specific situation (i.e. I didn't really know what to put so I filled it with staples and some decent alternative cards for the deck). For this guide <strong>I will bold hypothetical combos to provide an example of some things you can do with the deck. If you'd rather figure it our for yourself or just know the deck well enough already, ignore those bolded portions.</strong>  &nbsp;  This deck likes to go first as you run several powerful floodgates in the form of Rivalry of Warlords and Zombie World, as well as have access to a strong omni-negate counter trap with Vampire Domination. Doomking Balerdroch is also far better used when going first to prevent your opponent from setting up. That said, the deck <em>can</em> also go second somewhat thanks to Doomking's ability to break boards and the inherent ability of Vampires to hit things real good (as well as Vampire Red Baron's creature swap effect).  The main goal of the deck is to open a combination of either Uni-Zombie or Shiranui Solitaire and Glow-Up Bloom, Necroworld Banshee or Zombie World. <strong>Opening Uni-Zombie and Glow-up Bloom, for instance, will allow you to pitch Necroworld Banshee from deck to get Zombie World and then discard Glow-up Bloom to summon Doomking Balerdroch (AKA standard Zombie World Control stuff). Obviously what you pitch from your hand/deck will depend on your exact opening hand.</strong> This is your primary combo and is what you want to be aiming for if you can help it. Handtraps ruin this combo so Called By the Grave is a mandatory 3-of to counteract the Veilers and Ashes that will be thrown at your poor Uni-Zombie. 1 copy of Gozuki and Foolish Burial provide potential alternative combo starters should you fail to open Shiranui Solitaire or Uni-Zombie, though they require more specific opening hands to fully access Zombie World and Balerdroch. Other ways of accessing the combo exist, <strong>such as normal-summoning Glow-up Bloom with Zombie World up and making Linkuriboh to summon Doomking Balerdroch from the deck</strong>. Often a ""completed"" Zombie World play will end on Uni-Zombie and Doomking Balerdroch, which you can then link away into Vampire Sucker as Balerdroch will summon back from the grave on the following standby phase, netting you a draw off of Sucker.  The standard Zombie Synchro play is still possible here, enabled by a single copy of Gozuki. The only level 8 Synchro I'm running that you can make off of Uni-Zombie, Shiranui Solitaire and Gozuki alone is Psy-Framelord Omega as I've never found another level 8 to be worth it (without links in the grave for Borreload Savage Dragon), but other options are possible. I am also running a few fusions with Super Polymerization in the side deck for extra removal if you have to go second. You could main-deck Super Poly if you so choose as it's very good with Zombie World up, I just find it to often drain your hand at inopportune times.  The addition of Vampires somewhat complicates things as they both provide you with alternative opening plays while also occasionally clogging your opening hand. Often, if you fail to open the full Zombie World ""combo"" you can instead divert your attention toward the Vampire portion of the deck instead. If you open a way to discard or mill any 1 monster you can typically access a Vampire combo, although the specifics will depend on your exact hand somewhat. The main goal of Vampires is to put bodies on board and hopefully end up with a Synchro or XYZ monster to suit your purposes. While the deck wants to go first, Vampires are awkwardly stuck in a position where they both want to go first to set domination and avoid their weird battle phase restrictions while they also want to go second to steal/tribute the opponent's monsters and generally break boards and gain LP. There aren't really many defined Vampire ""combos"" and what they can do is largely determined by your exact opening hand, but I'll attempt to provide a sample combo for reference:  <strong>A Vampire-capable hand would be something like opening Uni-Zombie, either Vampire Familiar or Retainer and at least 1 other Vampire card to discard. Opening Uni-Zombie, Vampire Familiar and Vampire's Domain for instance would allow you to mill Vampire Retainer off of Uni-Zombie, activate Vampire's Domain (and use its effect for an additional normal summon), then send Familiar from hand to the GY to summon Retainer from the GY using its effect to search out either Vampire's Desire, then send the face-up Vampire's Domain to the GY to summon Familiar from the GY and search Shadow Vampire off its effect. At this point your field will have a face-up Uni-Zombie, Vampire Familiar and Vampire Retainer (both of which will be banished when they leave the field), with at least Vampire's Desire and Shadow Vampire in hand. You could potentially go for a level-8 Synchro play here if you so desired. Alternatively, activate Vampire's Desire to mill any desired Vampire you wish to summon from the GY (either Fraulein or Red Baron, depending on if you'd like to go for an XYZ play or not), then link any two monsters into Vampire Sucker and use your additional normal summon from Vampire's Domain to tribute the third monster for Shadow Vampire. Off of Shadow Vampire, summon Vampire Scarlet Scourge from the deck, which will trigger to special summon whatever Vampire you milled earlier (either Fraulein or Red Baron), and Vampire Sucker will let you draw a card. At this point your exact ending board will depend somewhat on what you decide to go for and what the two remaining cards in your hand are (a rank 6 XYZ for instance, like Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal can allow you to extend your combo and potentially get out Balerdroch/Zombie World depending on the two unused cards in your hand).</strong>  This deck has a ton of level manipulation, which enables you to easily make Synchros with a variety of hands. I run a decent Synchro package of level 7's and 8's as those are the easiest to make in the deck, but you could theoretically make Synchros of any level with this deck thanks to the wide variety of levels, tuners and level modulation of Vampire's Desire and Uni-Zombie. Obviously other links could be played as well, though I find the ones I've listed to generally be sufficient.  The Zombie World support and Vampires do have a great deal of synergy that is worth noting. Having Zombie World up on the field allows you to tribute any of your opponent's monsters for your tributes so long as Vampire Sucker is on the field, which comes in handy surprisingly often in longer games and lets you easily get around problematic monsters. Glow-up Bloom also lets you search (or special summon with Zombie World up) <em>any</em> level 5 or higher Zombie monster. This means you can search out or summon Vampire combo pieces as well, mainly Vampire Scarlet Scourge or Shadow Vampire (Fraulein can also be searched if you need to beat over something big). Vampires allow you to make big boards and do lots of damage while sustaining yourself, while Doomking Balerdroch and pals give you a somewhat more consistent goal to reach for and offer an insane level of control thanks to the sheer power of Balerdroch (with Zombie World up, of course). Part of the beauty of this deck is its versatility, as no two games will ever go the same way. Unfortunately, while this variety is the deck's most entertaining element and makes it extremely fun to play, ultimately the unpredictable nature of the deck results in poor consistency and easily-interruptible combos.  &nbsp;  TL;DR  The main idea of the deck is to go first and be annoying, but going second is also possible. Your primary goal should be aiming for Zombie World control status (Zombie World up and Balerdroch in play). Vampires can extend plays beyond this point depending on your opening but are more hand-specific and should be regarded as secondary to the primary goal. If the primary goal cannot be achieved using your opening hand, aim to end on whatever board is possible given your opening, whether that be Synchros or XYZ monsters.  This deck isn't very competitive but this list is what I've found to work best against a wide variety of decks of varying power levels. Good luck and have fun!"

To clear your opponents board from annoying monster effect and simultaniously  boosting our own ATK we use Kaijus which synergise way too well with Crusadia. This deck profile prefers going second but going first is also possible.To achieve a full Crusadia Rotation (Crusadia Magius -&gt; Crusadia Regulex -&gt; Crusadia Equimax) we need atleast two Crusadia monsters in our hand. <h3> Why I use...</h3> <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></li> </ul> He's basically a free Special Summon, which can be really handy since you can also trigger your Crusadia Link Monsters with the summon. In my opinion playing two is more enough because starting second isn't guaranteed and he could also brick your hand.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a></li> </ul> We're using two kinds of field spells which synergise way too perfect together ( Black Garden -&gt; Crusadia Revival ) which makes terraforming a must in this deck profile.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a></li> </ul> This card is insane because we can literally erase all monsters on the field and Special Summon two Kaijus, one on each side of the field, which also helps us because Kaijus synergise so well with Crusadia Link Monsters (Regulex &amp; Equimax). We also use this card as negate bait since its a nice to have but not necessarily a must for us to build our board. <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Crusadia Testament"">Crusadia Testament</a></li> </ul> This card is our draw power, after attacking the enemy (and if he still lives which doesnt happen too often) we can active this card to draw as many cards as the links of our attacking link monster (so mostly 2-3 cards)  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Crusadia Revival"">Crusadia Revival</a> &amp; 2x <a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a></li> </ul> Finally, we get to meet one of the most OP combos in this deck. The Goal is to active Black Garden at the start of your turn (before summoning monsters) so we can fill our enemies field with 800/800 Tokens. You may ask why this is an advantage for us? Thats's pretty easy, because we can search for Crusadia Revival with <a data-name=""Crusadia Regulex"">Crusadia Regulex</a>.

Because of that i've changed my general strategy around <a data-name=""future Fusion"">future Fusion</a> a little bit. To make the deck faster I try to get <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> as fast as possible in my Hand with either <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> and <a data-name=""Aprrentice Illusion"">Aprrentice Illusion</a> and eventually on the field with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> and <a data-name=""Cosmo Brain"">Cosmo Brain</a>. Also I run 3 <a data-name=""The Eye of Timaeus"">The Eye of Timaeus</a> so I can summon <a data-name=""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</a> with that DM on the field. The problem with future fusion is that it is just too slow and the deck is already lacking consistency and speed. For that I also play <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a> instead of Duality, which seems to work pretty well. Sadly I had to cut out <a data-name=""Dragon Revival Rhapsody"">Dragon Revival Rhapsody</a> completely because I don't run 3 Future Fusion's anymore which means I wont have that many Blue-Eyes in my GY all the time.  <strong>*Update* 2</strong>  I've added a new card for this deck: <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a>. The good thing about this card is that you can fusion summon DM the Dragon Knight, by banishing the materials from your GY, which gives you an additional way to summon your main Monster. Also if you activate Future Fusion and set this card you can already special summon 1 additional DM the Dragon Knight in your 1st Standby-Phase with <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a>. Because of this I've changed the ratios of <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""The Eye of Timaeus"">The Eye of Timaeus </a> and <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>. I'm actually pretty surprised how good this deck turned out to be... It is still nowhere near competetive but I think I've managed to improve the draw power and general consistency of the deck significantly.  <strong>Why?</strong>  '<a data-name=""Blue-eyes white Dragon"">Blue-eyes white Dragon</a>' and '<a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>' have always been one of my favourite Monsters in this game and I've always wanted to build a deck which incorporates both Monsters. Well, after lots of thinking and testing, I think that I have build a deck, which is by no means competetive, but it can be very fun to play and actually surprisingly strong against certain match ups.  <strong>Strategy</strong>  The main goal of this deck is to summon <a data-name=""Dark Magician The Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician The Dragon Knight</a> as fast as possible. Allthough he is not very easy to summon, once on the field he can protect all of your Spell and Trap-cards, like <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a>, <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> and even <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>(which is the card you can use to summon him aswell). If you want to make your board with him even stronger you could side in <a data-name=""Dimension Guardian"">Dimension Guardian</a>(which can be protected from him aswell) and equip it to him so he can't be destroyed by battle or card effect. Once you have him on your board you don't have to worry about cards like <a data-name=""Twin-Twister"">Twin-</a><a data-name=""Twin-Twister"">Twis</a><a data-name=""Twin-Twister"">ters</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare-Pheonix"">Knightmare-Pheonix</a> or other annyoing cards. Also if your opponent wants to get rid of your Spells and Traps they need to deal with a 3000 ATK Monster first which may give you the advantage.  <strong>Why I use...</strong> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a></li> </ul> Magician's Rod is a great card to open up with because it can search <a data-name=""Dark Magicial Circle"">Dark Magicial Circle</a>, <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> and even <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a> if you need it. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX</a> and <a data-name=""Magcian of Chaos"">Magcian of Chaos</a></li> </ul> The thing I like about this deck is that you can summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX</a> relativeley easy either by <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> or with<a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art""> Advanced Ritual Art</a>. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Cosmo Brain"">Cosmo Brain</a></li> </ul> This card can be useful if you have either a <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> or a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> in your hand which you can't use at the moment. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The Eye of Timaeus"">The Eye of Timaeus</a> and <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a></li> </ul> The good thing about future Fusion is that it puts your <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes white Dragon"">Blue-Eyes white Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> in the GY in the 1st Standby Phase and you generally want to see them there. The problem is that it is a very slow card and prone to Spell and Trap removal.  You could run 3 <a data-name=""The Eye of Timaues"">The Eye of Timaues</a> instead of 1 if you also run 3 <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>. Then it is rather easy to get your DM on the field and actually use The Eye of Timaeus. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a></li> </ul> A very powerful card that can protect <a data-name=""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</a> aswell <ul>  	<li>only 2 <a data-name=""Chaos form"">Chaos form</a></li> </ul> I only run 2 because it is searchable and advanced ritual is almost always the better option to use <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality or </a><a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a></li> </ul> At first I didn't even put Duality in my main deck because there was no space... The thing is, you really need to run 3 in this deck to give this deck some kind of draw power. You almost always want to pick <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a> with Duality if you can. The problem is that you can't special summon during the turn you activate duality which slows down the deck even more. If you don't like Duality that much try out <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a>. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Judgment of Anubis"">Judgment of Anubis</a></li> </ul> This is also a very powerful card to protect your spell and Trap cards from your opponents Spell cards. If you know that your opponent runs something like 3 <a data-name=""Twin-Twisters"">Twin-Twisters</a> you could stack this card up to 3 if you want.  &nbsp;  <strong>Summary</strong>  This deck will probably not win you any tournaments but I think it is really fun to play and acutually viable against certain match-ups. It's just so satisfying to swarm your board with 'Blue-eyes-' and 'Dark Magician-' Monsters and if you're lucky you can make pretty insane boards which can be annoying to deal with. I recommend you try it out yourself or give me some tips or suggestions on what I can improve. Please leave a comment, I would like to hear your thouhgts and opinions.  &nbsp;"

That was, and I know it sounds questionable but, due more to my inexperience than the effectiveness of the deck. I had no prior experience facing off against Sky Strikers or Mystic Mine, and guess what I faced in the first three rounds? :D And if I'd been more comfortable playing with a timer, I would've defeated the Mystic Mine, as well. I'm not trying to brag, I still lost, I'm just saying the deck performed above my expectations.</em> <em>My loss to Salamangreats, on the other hand, I have a harder time explaining, but it prompted me to put Called By The Grave in the side as well at 3.</em> <em>My only major regret was not siding more hate for Sky Strikers in at the time, but I have since addressed that balance with 3 Twin Twister in the main (as opposed to 2 in the previous incarnation) and 2x Eradicator Epidemic in the side. I've also decided to toss my hero, Vanity's Ruler, into the side as well, because I think if I get out Vanity's Ruler and an Eradicator on turn 1 against Orcust or Sky Striker, I might just be able to do the job. ""  </em>Post-July Banlist Note: Whew! That was a close one. Nessie and Jackabunny to 2 does kinda suck, but with the sheer draw power of this deck, it's not much of a hit. Not compared to a few decks I could mention. &gt;_&gt; I look forward to seeing what new and wonderful boards I can try to break this coming season. :D <em> </em></div></blockquote> The overall strategy is simplistic; go second, break whatever board they have over your knee, preferably with a sickening snap, and run them over with your big bois.  There's card draw for days if you get the deck going even just a little bit, and if you're unlucky enough to be forced to go first, a Hope Harbinger and a Felgrand isn't the absolute worst turn 1 ever, just don't overextend for it.  And for anybody who asks about why Grapha is in here, instead of culling the excess Dark World for more famous cards (like Blackwing Zephyros or hand traps or something), the answer is that, on average, we can bring Grapha back 3 times in a turn. Overlays, link summons, beaters, you name it. Ol' Grampa Grapha is the dilapidated boss monster for the job. And recurring 8's, easy 8's, are a big boon for one of our most fun draw cards: Coach King Giantrainer. Draw 3 cards, most likely inflict a free 2400 damage if you're getting close to running out of time in your match! Yes, I am a bad person! :D But Phantom Skyblaster is really just a personal preference. I've been using that little punk for years, well before it was cool, so I don't really wanna stop now that he's got a decent task to perform. You could just as easily swap him out for Zephyros or Genex Ally Birdman to bounce your Dangers and just keep drawing, if you wanted.  Yay for choices!"

The said Synchro Monsters are <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Side-unique"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Side-unique"">side-unique</a> and have 2 effects, following the pattern below:  <i>● If your Synchro Monster whose original Level is [two Levels higher than its own original Level] is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect while this card is in your GY: You can banish 1 other Zombie monster from your GY, and if you do, Special Summon this card.</i> <i>● If this card is Special Summoned from the GY: You can [...]</i>  The only exception to the first effect is ""<a title=""Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gashadokuro,_the_Skeletal_Mayakashi"">Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi</a>"", a Level 11 monster that requires a Link monster to be destroyed, instead. The archetype in fact has a Link monster, the Link-2 ""<a title=""Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Onna,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</a>"", that cannot be targeted for attacks while pointing to a Synchro Monster and that halves the ATK/DEF of a monster when a Synchro Monster is destroyed by the opponent.  The second Trigger Effect of the ""Mayakashi"" monsters range from immunity against destruction/effects to card destruction and Deck milling. They can be used by being preemptively Special Summoned from the Graveyard by generic effects such as ""<a title=""Book of Life"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Life"">Book of Life</a>"", ""<a title=""Mezuki"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>"", and ""<a title=""Call of the Haunted"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"", for example, or by ""<a title=""Mayakashi Metamorphosis"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mayakashi_Metamorphosis"">Mayakashi Metamorphosis</a>"". The two latter can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays, by Special Summoning the ""Mayakashi"" during their turn. Also, if their second effect is triggered by their own <a title=""Condition"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Condition"">condition</a>, they can be combined with ""<a title=""Shiranui"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shiranui"">Shiranui</a>"" monsters, that can have their effects triggered when banished, especially ""<a title=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shiranui_Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a>"".  “<a title=""Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Musume,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi</a>” adds more versatility and consistency to the deck, as she makes it easier to quickly link summon “<a title=""Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Onna,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</a>” and continue climbing the Synchro ladder. In addition to that, her effect to send any Zombie of your choice from your deck to the GY once she’s special summoned from your hand or GY means that cards like “<a title=""Doomking Balerdroch"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Doomking_Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>”, “<a title=""Glow-Up Bloom"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Glow-Up_Bloom"">Glow-Up Bloom</a>”, and “<a title=""Necroworld Banshee"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Necroworld_Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>” are now more realistic options for the deck, and also allow a “<a title=""Zombie World"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_World"">Zombie World</a>” engine to be more viable.  “<a title=""Mayakashi Winter"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mayakashi_Winter"">Mayakashi Winter</a>” also helps with the OTK strategy by reducing the ATK of your opponent’s monsters, and it helps that multiple copies will stack on top of each other while on the field. Usually when you’re done climbing the Synchro ladder, you’re left with a “<a title=""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dakki,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi</a>” on the field that’s not doing anything so you can use this card’s effect to send it to the GY to draw a new card.

Witch Cyberse Wicckind in  the extra Monster Zone, one or possibly even two of the Deck-Masters in the Zones Linked to it will render your Opponent unable to target your Monsters, Attack them or Destroy them wich Card Effects. The basic Combo here is to brimg out Link Disiple first and summon Link Devotee into his Zone, to be tributed and to exchange one card in your Hand for a possibly superior one, since getting Cynet Ritual, Fusion and Magican is strangely often. Devotee then will give you two tokens to summon Cyberse Witch. She will search you Cynet Ritual and Magician but more importantly, she special summons one level 4 or lower Monster from your Graveyard to freely go into Cyberse Wicckind. This Card protects itself from Battle and Card effect destruction when Link-Summoned and Cyberse Monster, to wich it points. There is a simple combo to mention here. When Cyberse Wicckind banishes Balancer Lord for its Effect to search a Cyberse tuner Monster (Synchron), balancer Lord allows you to special summon Synchron immediatly after the search, so there won't  be problems with bringimg him out. If you don`t manage to bring out two of the three ace Monsters, you can simply Link two into Honeybot and make your Ace unable to be targeted by effects and be destroyd by battle. Update Jammer and Transcode Talker are a neat lttle combo for 2800 attack with untargetable Monsters. The side deck is a simple disruption based thing wich safes your plays and makes some decks unable to function normally. This deck is heavly susecptible to Zombie world, since most effects are Cyberse Based."
