If you guys want to see my new Mekk-Knight Invoked build with or without a YouTube deck profile, go leave my newest Trickstar deck a like and or comment to reach that 4 likes goal! After a lot of testing with this new idea I had of combining the Dinosaur OTK engine and Sky Strikers, this is the conclusion I've come to. I really like this deck. While looking around at cards in general I realized <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a> isn't a once per turn and can get you spells in the graveyard fast, as well as the other spells that Pure Dinosaurs use like <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> and <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a>. So I figured it'd be a good idea to test this theory out. And it was amazing. It might sound silly at first combining these two archetypes, but Dinosaurs have one of the most powerful boss monsters, <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a> and other monsters to support its ability to OTK fast like <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> while Sky Striker stuns your opponent. Sky Striker lacks this ability to OTK fast, so combining Dinosaurs with it helps fix that problem. This deck can go first or second since it can OTK but also uses the Sky Striker engine to control your opponent. I also put in a <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> Turbo engine which is just <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a> and <a data-name=""Glow-up Bulb"">Glow-up Bulb</a> just in case your opponent decides to make you go first game 2 or 3 and you don't open any Sky Striker cards. The deck has a pretty low brick rate I'd say, at least from my experience. I've also found that while testing this deck and making final edits that in the grind game, this deck easily out grinds your opponent because of the Sky Striker engine. Also I want to say that I really like <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a>, I feel like people underestimate this card when really it's super good. Sometimes using Book of Moon to flip the first monster they summon face-down can make them end their turn. It messes up a lot of decks, especially combo decks because most of the time they will try to summon two monsters to make a link 2 and using Book of Moon to flip that second monster face-down prevents them from link summoning since you can't link summon with a face-down monster because it is considered unknown while face-down. I hope you guys really like this deck as I worked hard on it just like all the other decks I post! Stick around for more!"

To make the most out of <em>Magical Merchant</em>'s ability, <em>Danger! Response Team</em> is returned to the bottom of the deck by discarding a <em>Danger!</em> monster before flipping <em>Magical Merchant</em> face-up.  Other cards like the <em>Danger!</em> and <em>Shaddoll</em> monsters help cycle through the deck and get monsters out for Extra Deck card resources. <em>Destrudo</em> specifically is used to both Synchro summon <em>Black Rose Dragon</em> and as a way to get that one more monster you need on your field for a Link summon. <em>Dark Grepher</em> and <em>Armageddon Knight</em> are used to help trigger graveyard effects of other monsters. <em>Broww</em> is used solely as draw power off <em>Danger!</em> effects and <em>Marron</em> is used to ensure you don't deck out.  There's a OTK combo which mainly relies around emptying your deck into the graveyard with <em>Magical Merchant</em> and then summoning <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> and attacking for lethal on the same turn. To support this combo there's a couple of contingency plans for when things aren't optimal: <ul>  	<li><strong>If <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> is in the GY:</strong> <em>Wee Witch's Apprentice</em> can be used to recover <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> from the GY.</li>  	<li><strong>If you Need Opponent's Cards Gone:</strong> <em>Black Rose Dragon</em> is used to wipe the field to get rid of any annoying cards.</li> </ul> In the ""worst"" case scenario (Not <em>really</em> the worst case...) where <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> is in the graveyard and your opponent controls cards that'll stop your attack from going through, you can use both <em>Wee Witch's Apprentice</em> and <em><a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a></em> to return a copy of <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> to the hand and wipe your opponents field before summoning the <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> and banishing all your remaining monsters in your GY to gain lethal attack. (This relies on there being enough cards in your GY though, so keep that in mind).  &nbsp; <p>I'm more than appreciate feedback and suggestions, I just thought making a deck around <em>Rainbow Dark Dragon</em> would be a fun thing to try :)</p>"

Double Valk can lock your opponent from attacking and give you time to summon a more powerful monster as well. In fact, stall is the name of the game with this deck. Keep yourself alive until you draw the card you need, whether it be to make a comeback or to summon a powerful monster. As true to the character as you can get."

To break it down, the key strat of Ishizu is decking her opponent out using Exchange of the Spirit. However, for some ungodly reason, Konami errata'd it and made it completely unplayable. So in order to make her deck, I had to improvise. I felt just making Gravekeepers was lame and uninspired. I didn't completely take them out of the equation though...  This is basically Mudora beat down with some anti meta tech tossed in. Necrovalley stops your opponent from messing with their GY and Kotodama, while keeping with the EARTH Fairy theme, prevents monsters with the same name from being face-up on the field. Also, since all your monsters are EARTH, doesn't hurt to run a Gozen Match, ya?

It isn't game over if you do get them because Pittore exists, just make sure you ditch them asap. Haine is typically a better starter monster to end on then Verre, but if you can get both then that's perfect. Make sure you get Schmietta in the GY early on to banish so you can have Bystreet ready to go at all times, the deck simply wouldn't work without it.  Before doing ANYTHING, if you have Instant Fusion, summon Millennium-Eyes. This will save you from any stray hand traps the opponent may use. Beware of Called by the Graves. Them hitting you when you pop off Schmietta is borderline game ending. If you play correctly, you can typically out grind most if not all your opponent's moves, thanks to Witchcrafter's amazing recovery.  Reasoning is the nuts. Activate it only when you know you aren't going to get ashed because you don't want that to be wasted.  Side could use some work but I think I got the Main Deck down."

I did not receive any comments telling me to do a YouTube video of me show casing the deck, therefore, I didn't. After many banlist hits, this deck has become less and less consistent. This build that I've come up with from scratch is pretty consistent, it performed well in testing, and with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> back at 1, this deck can be a killer. This deck always goes second unless your opponent forces you to go first (which they most likely will game 2 or 3, and I have prepared a great side deck for that). The goal of this deck is to go second, handtrap your opponent, make them end their turn and then OTK them using the Mekk-Knights and <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> or <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>. I know nobody really plays <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> anymore, but I personally like it because it helps clear your opponent's field so you can OTK faster. Playing many handtraps is essential in this deck as you need to have your opponent end their turn when they go first after hitting them with 1, or several handtraps. As long as you know the meta and what to handtrap for each meta deck, you should be able to make your opponent pass their turn, allowing you to go in for the OTK. A tip I want to give you guys about <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> in this deck, I'm sure not everyone likes this card in this deck, or even in general because it can banish the core pieces in your deck you need to play. This is why I play 3 <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> etc. As you can see, in the deck most of the cards I chose to play are at 3. This is to help prevent you from banishing all the core pieces like 3 Invocation or 3 Aleister, etc. But the tip that is helpful, is I strongly recommend, if you have Pot of Desires in hand, it is best to search Invocation using Aleister first before using desires, and or searching <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse"">Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse</a>. This way you won't have to worry about banishing your core pieces since you already have a copy in hand! I hope this helps those of you who dislike desires, at least in this deck. As for the side deck and your opponent forcing you to go first, a card that has made a big comeback recently is <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a>. This card is awesome against most of the meta decks. It stops Sky Striker from adding back Engage from their graveyard or any Sky Striker card they want to add back from their graveyard to their hand. It stops <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a> from special summoning itself from the graveyard. Its good against so many other decks and tactics, you get the point. Anyways, if your opponent makes you go first, siding in D.D. Crow is amazing because it is dark and I realized you can fusion using Aleister and D.D. Crow into <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> which can be a hard monster to get over depending on what deck your opponent is playing, for example it will probably be hard for Salamangreat to get over it since they need to activate more than 1 monster effect per turn. Plus you can boost its attack with Aleister in hand if they attempt to attack it. Also, D.D. Crow is just a great handtrap to begin with, so even if you end your turn immediately after you draw, being able to use D.D. Crow on your opponent could really hurt them, leaving them vulnerable to an OTK the following turn. Also <a data-name=""Shared Ride"">Shared Ride</a> is another huge commotion currently. Siding these bad boys in will definitely make your opponent think twice before searching when they force you to go first! Most of the other side deck cards are pretty self explanatory, but of course if you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment or direct message me. I really hope you guys enjoy this deck, and stick around for more!"

However; Ankuriboh(there newest card) is one of the card that I only use once, but I have it at 3 because it gives you a free monster during the battle phase, and it can search out monster reborn(not that you will need it). called by the grave is there to protect yourself from any hand traps that get in the way which happens quit often with this deck(even though it only affects a small amount of the deck). Black luster soldier is in there to get some power on the field. and one of my favorites, Rainbow Kuriboh, can help negate attacks from the hand or GY. as for some of the spicy tech choices in the deck, I have decided to go with mimiclay, the reason for this is because it can target any of your Kuriboh/Synchron monsters on the field,  and summon a copy of it from the deck. I honestly love the card and I would recommend it  to any deck that utilizes level 2 or lower monsters(**Couphcouph** krawlers). multiply is a good card as a replacement for scape goat, and foolish burial is good for an early set up with kuriborn. <h2>The Extra Deck</h2> The extra deck is proabably the same old same old extra deck that every one runs with some miner adjustments. lack rose dragon is a synchro version of bomber dragon and is a decent option if your in a tight jam. Thousand-Eyes restrict is there for the instant fusion/removal target and can also be used to get link kuriboh on the board for your needlefiber plays. and lion heart is there incase you need a decent power house if you have used up your borreload dragon. skull dread is obviously there for draw and special summoning power and is one of the main cards for the deck. summon sorc is extra summoning power, trigate is for negations, the knightmare engine is for removal and GY set up, needle fiber is for the main combo, and linkuriboh is to help deal with the power on the board. apart from underclock taker(who doesn't do much in the deck), the extra deck is completely necessary for almost most of your combos which involve Jet Synchron and Needlefiber. <h2>The Side Deck</h2> the side deck is not really that important, in fact all the cards in the side deck actually slow the deck down, but they are some good options if you want to play a slower and more cautious game. I'm not going to go to much detail into the side deck because it is literally just like any other side deck. <h2>The Combo</h2> this is a very combo oriented deck, however, it is not that hard to learn because they are the same combos that you do with jet synchron, glow-up bulb, and needle fiber. the only difference is that the cards actually help you set up by dumping kuriboh cards from your hand or deck to the GY so you can set up for later plays. you can also help extend the combo by using flute of summoning kuriboh so you can go into a skull dread and get your draws. like the side deck, I'm not going to go into much detail with the combos because not only are they mind melted to my brain, but because I'm already tired from writing this article. they really aren't that hard to learn. <h2>What Do I Think of The Deck?</h2> the deck is actually not that bad, you do brick on some occasions, but they are fixable with allure of darkness and upstart goblin. you can possibly fix the consistency issues by adding dark world dealings, but it also may cause problems since it might give your opponent that ash blossom they so desperately needed to clog up your turn. aside from consistency boosts, not a lot of hand traps affect the deck because they deck does so many things that it will make your opponent k harder to break your combos harder then breaking Donald trumps border wall.  anyway that is all for this article, feel free to use this deck yourself and give me some tips on how I can upgrade the deck. the are a lot of the veriations of the deck such as danger!

Introducing a new spicy engine to a legendary deck!,"So after spending some time away from the deck, I decided to come back to it ready for the next format. Although my previous build, containing Windwitch, was consistent and powerful - I felt it was time to update my deck list as well as my playstyle. This is where the introduction of Xyz summoning comes in.  I have always loved Xyz Summoning. And with that, comes my love of Raidraptors. I've spent a few weeks coming up with a way to mix the two archetypes together and I believe I have done it. As you will see, the Trickstar lineup of cards is very standard with most builds you will find at events, the same can be said for the Artifact engine. However, where my build differs is with the introduction of Raidraptor - Last Strix and the accompanying Rank-Up-Magic Skip Force. This gives the deck a arsenal of monsters to choose from within the Extra Deck to act as a Boss Monster. Going first, my preference is to bring out Ultimate Falcon and slowly burn my opponent or attack over every monster they bring out. Going second, I opt for Revolution Falcon and OTK my opponent through it's effect.  With the Artifact engine, you have the potential to shut down your opponents plays with their Extra Deck through Artifact Scythe. I play two copies so I can lock my opponent out a second time if needed. The Moralltach can be swapped out for a different Artifact of your choice, but I use it to single out problematic floodgates or field spells.  For the Extra Deck plays, I have included Scapegoat to lead me into different plays that are needed at the time. If you need to dig deep into your deck, try and make Saryuja Skull Dread to draw 4 cards, and place 3 back into the deck. This allows you to find those important resources for follow-up plays, such as Raidraptor pieces or a Reincarnation. You can replace Saryuja for a Borreload or Borrelsword Dragon if you so choose, but I do not see them as necessary with Ultimate Falcon making for a brilliant Boss Monster.  Overall, I am happy with this list and sharing it with the community will hopefully encourage some more creativity into this upcoming format. We have seen a lot of Orcust and PK shenanigans this season, maybe it is now time for the Raidraptors to shine as a threat to the meta.  Enjoy the list,  Many thanks,  - Jack"

You can use Jumbo Drill and Harvester to bring up your most strong cards and special summon them. With Rank-up you can XYZ summon fast once you first XYZ summoned, if you don't want to use the infinitrack Link monsters. The Infinitrack Fortress is the hardest to summon, so that is why I used Decode Talker and Borrelguard Dragon, to increase the number of XYZ I could do and bring Megaton."

After that, summon Magnus to the field  How to Accomplish:  Use the monsters to swarm the field. (Info Below)  &nbsp;  Monsters <ul>  	<li>Danger!

You can banish this card to search the Trap card or Boots.</li>  	<li>Spell Striker - A free monster to summon if you have Spells to banish.</li>  	<li>Psychic Wheelder - If a level 3 monster is on your field, you can Special summon this card.

It is also an Equip card that Isolde can send to GY.</li> </ul> <ul>  	<li>Overdone Burial - If you discard a level 4 card, you can grab a level 3 card from the GY. If you discarded Destrudo, you can grab a level 4 or 3 card from the GY. It is also an Equip card that Isolde can send to GY.</li>  	<li>Autonomous Action Unit - You can use this card if your opponent has a monster in the GY you can use, or you can steal a monster that can help you win the game. It is also an Equip card that Isolde can send to GY.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Trap Card <ul>  	<li>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine - You can summon this card as a Warrior monster.

It can also be used as a wall.</li>  	<li>Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow - Its the XYZ that will give you extra materials to Number 27.</li>  	<li>Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus - Its the XYZ that Number 27 will summon. Its unaffected by any effects at 4 or more materials with different names. It also locks your opponent from drawing and searching by card effects (6 or more materials with different names). It can also send a card to the deck without targeting (this can help is something will beat it over or to prevent from abuse of other monsters you control).</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Side Goal:  If you go first, or if you can't summon Number 27, or if you need to do something imporant, you can go to these Extra Monsters for backup  &nbsp;  Extra Deck Cards (Side Goal) <ul>  	<li>Cyberse Quantum Dragon - a Level 7 Synchro you can summon. This card will return an attacking monster that can beat it over. It also prevents attacking other monsters you control.</li>  	<li>Black Rose Dragon - a Level 7 Synchro you can summon. This card can clear out the entire field if there is a board setup.</li>  	<li>Number 39: Utopia/Number S39: Utopia the Lightning - It helps you beat out almost any monster in battle, but only once.</li>  	<li>The Phantom Knights of Break Sword - Helps you destroy a card on your opponents field. You can target Magnus to prevent destroying one of your cards, provided that Magnus has 4 materials.</li>  	<li>Borreload Dragon - A boss monster that you can summon if needed. It can steal monsters and it is immuned to monster targeting effects. It can also lower an attack and defense of a monster.</li>  	<li>Borrelguard Dragon - A boss monster that you can summon if needed. It prevents one attack and it is immuned to effect destruction. It can also revive a monster that was destroyed in your turn.</li>  	<li>Borrelsword Dragon - A boss monster that you can sumon if needed. It prevents also one attack and it is immuned to battle destruction. It can attack twice if you use the postion changing effect.</li>  	<li>Troymare Pheonix - Destroys a Spell/Trap card.</li>  	<li>Troymare Cereberus - Destroys a Monser card.</li>  	<li>LANPhorhynchus - A substitution for Isolde just in case.</li> </ul> The main problem of this is that it is reliant to your opponent on what monster it will summon, but you have backups, so you won't be dead on arrival.It can also be disrupted by your opponent by non-destruction removal or negation. I believe that this deck is almost consistent on bringing out Magnus, but you can adjust the deck if you wish.

But ever since then i have made a few changes to make it better. Still Accepting Suggestions  Anyway The Point of this Deck is to try and Get your Silent Magician on the field that can negate spells once per turn as well as your boss monster which would be lv 8. She is also got a handy effect that if she is destroyed by battle or card effect you can Speciel Summon a lv 8 to the field from your deck or hand.  And you can use the traps and stuff to try and protect said deck from its weakness which is mainly traps. If you can get Royal Decree down it is a Good Continuous trap to keep your opponent from activating any traps on you. Only Downfall is it prevents you as well.  But the Traps in this Deck can be used to try and keep traps from harming you and attacks till you can get set up. Anyway as i said this is my first deck i built custom and it got me to the finals on a Tournament Online. Also if anyone has any suggestions to help make it more efficient i would greatly appreciate it.

Xiangke Magician is to help enable you to get off Ranging dragons effects so you can make an easy OTK on your opponent, Zero and Dark worm are there to enable plays with chrono graph sorcerer and Electrumite, Odd-eyes Persona and Mirage dragon are there mostly for extra pendulum crap and destruction triggers for sky iris, allure of darkness is for your casual draw power, Spiral flame strike and duelist alliance are your search cards of the deck which might be the best search cards in the game to be honest, and the rest we don't need to talk about because they are just stuff for obvious reasons. as for consistency, the odd-eyes deck can certainly get a lot of stuff done, but the problem is that there is barely any protection for the deck other than the usual solemn cards(which people don't really play any more). <h2>The Side Deck</h2> the the side deck is your usual same old same old from my previous deck proviles except there is no ash blossom because I find it two bricky in a deck like this. in stead I have replaced it with phantazmei because not only can you use it as xyz material for absolute dragon, butt you can also help protect some your board for the next turn. affect valor is a good negate plus a great tuner for the deck if you are in a match so you can go into savage dragon. called by the grave for hand trap protection, twin twisters for back row hate, and infinite impermanence for those annoying monsters you need to deal with. <h2>The Extra Deck</h2> the extra deck is where I was going to have to get a little more creative because the Odd-eyes archetype has a plethora of extra deck monsters, so it made is a little difficult for me to choose. for the extra deck we have the obvious absolute, raging, vortex, meteor burst, and rebellion dragon. Borreload savage dragon is to help negate your opponents pesky cards, skull dread for draws and extra summoning power, zefra Metal dragon(because why not), the good old knightmare engine that everyone plays, underclock taker, and electrumite which literally ties the whole deck together with a pretty bow on top.  sadly there is no combo section for the profile because I was to lazy to find any combos for the deck. <h2>What I Think of The Deck?</h2> Well its defiantly not a salamangreat deck, that's I can say. the deck is fine in terms of consistency, but the deck will stull struggle to keep boards on the field, which will make it harder to recover(which is why I put affect valor and phantazmei in order to help protect them). would defiantly think it would be cool if Odd-eyes got some more support like a link monster or something like that because lets be real, its not like you are gonna win a YCS with this deck or anything. but what I can say is that the deck is really fun and defiantly brings some nostalgic memories from the arc-v era. sadly that is going to the end of the article, please don't for get to like not just because I'm desperate, but it will also let me know if you want to see me bring back other decks from the past and make them a little more competitive."

(OCG),"Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to view this deck recipe I've concocted and actually applying irl in our local scene. I am hoping I'll be able to share my ideas about deck-building for this Archetype and find new ways to make it viable.  Without further ado, let's get started with the breakdown:  <a data-name=""Malefic Cyber End Dragon"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon</a> x1 - This deck runs a field spell and you will need a body the opponent has to get over in battle or to bait out their counter trap.  <a data-name=""Malefic Stardust Dragon x1"">Malefic Stardust Dragon</a> x1 - This card doubles as a beatstick and protects your field spell from destruction.  <a data-name=""Red-eyes Toon Dragon"">Red-eyes Toon Dragon</a> x2 - A Toon monster that has the ability to summon another Toon from your hand. Can be used for Rank 7 xyz plays. This current build can make one brick unless you want to run the alternative <a data-name=""Seven-Star Sword"">Seven-Star Sword</a> or <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>.  <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a> x1 - A Toon monster that can either search a Toon spell/trap or summon a Toon from the deck. Very reliable but can be tricky to summon outside of Red-eyes. I only run one because of the lack of tools to summon it consistently.  <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician Girl"">Toon Dark Magician Girl</a> x3 - A Toon monster that serves as the deck's main core and win condition. Certain errata has stopped her from being easily summoned from the deck so we run <a data-name=""Berry Magician Girl"">Berry Magician Girl</a> to search her. Simply direct attack your opponent while the other cards of this deck help you disrupt your opponent.  <a data-name=""Toon Cyber Dragon"">Toon Cyber Dragon</a> x1 - A Toon monster that serves a new purpose of being a searchable Toon and contact fusion spot removal for <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>. I run only one because of the one copy of said <em>Megafleet</em>.  <a data-name=""Necroface"">Necroface</a> x1 - <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>'s ""<em>cost</em>"" in addition to <a data-name=""Eater of Millions"">Eater of Millions</a> demands this card to help replenish your deck to keep going in the midgame. That is, if this card doesnt end up being banished face-down itself.  <a data-name=""Berry Magician Girl"">Berry Magician Girl</a> x3 - she keeps the whole thing going with her ability to search and be used by <a data-name=""T&lt;a href=&quot;http://Toon Dark Magician Girl&quot; data-name=&quot;oon Dark Magician Girl&quot; data-wplink-url-error=&quot;true&quot;&gt;oon Dark Magician Girl&lt;/a&gt;"">T</a><a data-name=""oon Dark Magician Girl."">oon Dark Magician Girl.</a> You can go for the alternative to run other <em>Magician Girl</em> cards to make the most out of her.  <a data-name=""Eater of Millions"">Eater of Millions</a> x3 - this deck doesn't heavily rely on the Extra Deck and this card can take care of boss monsters that get in your way.  <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> x3 - a budget-friendly option and this card can protect your field spell and/or disrupt your opponent. Adds the option to use Synchro Monsters in the extra deck.  Construction in progress... Come Back Later!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Absolutely so and it's still degenerate as ever. This deck turns the devastating costs cards like Pot of desires into huge pluse,"The point of this deck is to do three main things:  Cut off your opponent's graveyard  Heal for massive amounts of life points  Feed ""Da Eiza""  &nbsp;  If you have been playing on ygo pro lately, you have probably seen a variation of this deck. However, my deck has several built in win conditions. This done through a few simple combos. Lets go over a few:  Toll Hike or Extra Toll / Gravekeeper's Servant + Banisher of the Radiance / Macro Cosmos / Dimensional Fissure / Dark Law  This combo does not allow your opponent to even declare an attack. However, Toll hike doesn't allow you to make one either. Therefore, only use that as a last resort. This can stall for a while until you get Gren Maju Da Eiza. You also can use Lava Golem to put your opponent on an 8 turn clock. Lastly, you can use Battle fader (or Gren Maju Da Eiza if you do not have any banished cards; you can perhaps use necroface then have your Gren Maju Da Eiza have zero attack for this) and attack Lava Golem in order to activate Inferno Tempest (I on run one at this time. Even in a 60 card deck, I couldn't find any space for a second one. But two is not bad).  Ledger of the Legerdemain or Seer's Passbook / Inferno Tempest / Eater Of Millions / Pot of Desires + Soul Absorption  What makes this combo so op to me is that you're actually benefitting from the cost requirement of these cards. In most decks, the cost of Pot of Desires or even Pot of Indulgence is devestating. However, in this deck it's a huge plus. It allows for you to use the powerful draw engine card Ancient Leaf.  Trade-In + Danger! monsters (With or without banish cards)  Trade-In triggers the effects of Danger! monsters even when they're banished. This is just another bonus in this deck as everything fits well with each other.  Funky one ofs:  Balance of Judgment: This card is incredibly op to me and no one is using it. It has no draw back to it  Gold Sarcophagus: I'm more surprised that Necroface didn't get limited rather than this card. In any case, I primarily use this card to activate necroface's effect while also adding it to my hand.  D.D. Sprite: I use this card to further abuse Necroface. I also used this in an older version with instant fusion and  thousand-eyes restrict.  Fossil Dyna: You don't actually have to special summon much in this deck, so it doesnt' really stop you from gaining an advantage as much as it nueters your opponent.  Please try the deck and leave me any feedback on what cards you took out and maybe would put in. Would be greatly appreciated.  &nbsp;"

The main goal is to XYZ Summon ""Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale"", able to directly attack your opponent and, by removing XYZ material, can keep itself on the Field without the player losing LP. It is important to swarm the Field with as many Level 1 monsters as possible for this reason. All of the Main Deck monsters that are not ""Lyrilusc"" contributes to swarming and/or protecting the player from battle/effect damage.  Highly recommended that ""Assembled Nightingale"" is XYZ Summoned only when ""Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow"" is able to become XYZ material because of its effect that gives ""Assembled Nightingale"" immunity to becoming target of opponent card effects.  General ATK power is very low, so ""Borreload Dragon"" and ""Borrelswoard Dragon"" are in the Extra Deck in case of situations that require higher ATK.  ""Psychic Blade"" is used to boost ""Assembled Nightingale""'s ATK to achieve OTK. ""Instant Fusion"" is used to Summon Fusion monsters if needed and also serves as a method to swarm."

Enjoy!,"I beated a lot of decks with this. I think this is flawless, but it could have some counters. Anyway, I made it that you try to control the field with Zombie Synchros and use them to win.  <strong>My Favorite Cards in Deck:</strong>  Doomking Balerdroch: King of Zombies/Makes the Decisions  The ""zukis"": One triggers and one revives.  Glow-Up Bloom: Helps Assemble the group  Everliving Underworld Cannon: Why not add a little spice to our show?  Field Barrier: Protecting the Realm of Zombies  Zombie World: The Key to Victory!  Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy: Protects my Synchros from card effects  Shiranui Sunsaga: Can dominate a lot of the field (Make sure you have banished Synchros before doing this)  &nbsp;  Tip: Save Sunsaga until the end. You need to have a good number of banished synchros to make his effect better. (You will enjoy it. Trust Me)  &nbsp;  That's all. Enjoy the Deck :)  &nbsp;  Edit: Deck has been remade.  <strong>Noticeable Changes:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Majority of cards were removed such as the Shiranui Synchros (except Shogun)</li>  	<li>Many cards originally are not there; are replaced</li>  	<li>Quantity of certain cards changed (ex.  3 copies of Solitaire + Uni-Zombie)</li>  	<li>Some Extra Deck Monsters replaced</li> </ul> I hope this deck is much better than the first one.

Rota is there to search beat if you don't draw him first turn(which happens more often than not). foolish is to send your ""Orcust"" cards to the GY for your combo, monster reborn and Mayhem are there for swarming and possible misplays such as sending the wrong card to the GY. and ""There can be only one"" is there to lock out your opponent so you can protect your board. as for the ""Orcust"" engine (which is what makes the deck so consistent). the engine consists of 1 world wand, 2 orcust knightmare, 1 Harp horror, 1 Cymbal skeleton, 1 Orcust Return, 1 Orcustrated bebel, and 1 Orcust climax. you wont be uing the spells as much, but they are good options if you feel like using Galateas effect to search out a card from the deck. but the most important cards are the iconic trio(knightmare, harp and cymbal), these cards are the entire reason you are able to pull off the combo in the first place, and on top of that, the fur hires are the cards that help enable those plays because they can be used to summon mermaid to help bring out the best board possible. World wand is also there so you can bring back your ""Orcust"" cards either for extra material or in case you need an extra card for Galatea or Rusty. the other engine in this deck I decided to add is the ""Phantom knight"" engine because not only does it work with the ""Orcust"" cards, but it also lets you protect your board even more by searching out both fog blade and the Rank-Up magic card in one turn.</p>  <h2>The Extra Deck</h2> <p>The main combo in the deck also requires you to run the ""Orcust"" link monsters as well, which consist one 2 Galatea, and 1 Longearsu. the other important cards are Calamities, and Sheorcust Dingirsu. the reast of the cards are just filler for the extra deck except for folgo which can be used in the deck with your ""Orcust"" cards, butt we don't use him in the combo, he is mostly meant for a late game option so you can bust out Rafal for your negates. the knightmare's can also be used in the deck because not only are they flexible in every deck, but they are vital to the combo that I'm about to show you guys.</p>  <h2>The Combo</h2> Requirment: any 2 fur hire cards <ul>  	<li> summon the two fur hire cards</li>  	<li> use them to make cerberus</li>  	<li> use cerberus to make mermaid</li>  	<li> use mermaid to summon Knightmare Orcust and use them to summon Galatea</li>  	<li> trigger Knightmare orcusts effect to send harp horror to the GY and use horrors effect to summon cymbal skeleton</li>  	<li> link away cymbal and galatea to summon Rusty and use its effect to send silent boots to search the Rank-Up magic.</li>  	<li> use cymbal skeleton to summon galatea from the GY and summon Dingersu by using galatea as material, than use rusty's effect to destroy and prevent Dingersu's destruction.</li>  	<li> now summon Calamities on your oppoents turn we Rank-Up-Magic card.</li> </ul> <h2>What do I this of the deck?</h2> <p>this is probably by far one of my favorite decks because it is so consistent with what it does. yea you technically have to go first in order to pull off the negate, but it doesn't change the fact that you can pull of an awesome board even on the second turn(assuming your opponent doesn't have hand traps). speaking of hand traps, the deck is also a good option if you don't like to run hand traps because its not really effected by ash blossom as much as other fur hire builds. however, there has probably only one occasion where I bricked with the deck, but that is what the ""Orcust"" cards are there for, to make the deck more consistent and help protect the boards ""Fur hire""(yes I just made that joke. fight me about it). anyway, that is going to be the end of the profile, if you have enjoyed it. please leave a like and comment down below on how I can make this deck even better than it can right now.</p>"

Very much searches, and an interesting draw power. The standard starting field i use is Lancer Dragon and Persona on field with at least Arc in scale ( Pendulum Dragon popped at he end, and summoned Lancer through that). Most of the metas use extras  to combo and swarm so one good negate from persona can be enough to stop it a bit and Lancer is there to def Persona, and if Persona is defended with anouther Odd-eyes, probably another spec with Arc ( probably another Persona to negate) could happen. Btw, the extra deck is like a toolbox(like the entire deck) with powerful, monsters, and with so more other combos. Here some example: Stardust can come out relatively easy, even with nobledragon spec on a lvl 8, or Synchron in scale with two monster( one atleast lvl7) and after defending from destroy, it coming back to main monster zone so extra is freed,  Soul pendulum+Smile sorcerer with other monsters on the field can give a lot of draws, after soul pendu can raise your scale to 9, can pendu summon out sorcerer with others and after soul pendulum got a counter boosting probably your entire field and sorcerer give card about how many monsters including him. I've got 8 card drawed with him in one turn(with soul pendulum, extra pendulum summon). I could write some page with possible combos, but if you're interested you can try it out. Have fun!"

It is the build that I play in real life and I have a ton of fun playing it. I will continue to ask you guys if you want to see a specific deck profile or not. After testing with Trickstar Sky Striker for some time now for you guys, this is what I have come up with. The deck is very powerful and hardly ever bricks. The main objective of the deck is to go first, fill up your graveyard with as many spell cards as possible, use <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> to gain resources and use <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones"">Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</a> to go into <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku"">Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</a> during your end phase. After going into Shizuku you want to summon your Trickstar monsters like <a data-name=""Trickstar Candina"">Trickstar Candina</a> and <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> which will inflict damage to your opponent during their turn. The reason this deck is so good is because the Trickstar engine goes so well with the Sky Striker spells since <a data-name=""Trickstar Light Stage"">Trickstar Light Stage</a> is not a once per turn and you can activate multiple of them in the same turn, allowing you to fill up your graveyard with <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> and Light Stage(s). After you go first, it is hard for your opponent to get over your monsters since Shizuku says your opponent's monsters lose 100 attack and defense for each spell card in your graveyard, while you control a 1600 attack monster (Lycoris). Your opponent most likely won't be able to get over this because most of the time you will have handtraps on top of the board you've established. Handtrapping your opponent at the correct time, even once can mean the ending of their turn. Plus you may end on <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> set and or <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> which are two really powerful spells. Twin Twisters is so good in this deck because it allows you to discard another spell card which just fills your graveyard with even more spells, plus the Twin Twister you activated. I hope you guys enjoy the deck, it has seen a ton of success on ygopro when I was testing and building it from scratch."

It's quite a simple deck, using Battlelord's effect to prevent your opponent from activating cards of a certain type. Sure, it's not the most efficient. However, it gives the deck the ability to activate search effects without any fear of hand traps. If Battlelord would be destroyed by a card effect, most likely Revendread Executor will do the job. I honestly thought about using Revendread Slayer to make a Shiranui engine, but pure Vendread does far better."
