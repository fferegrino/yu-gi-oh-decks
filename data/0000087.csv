Not for everyone I guess, but it's fun when you are bored.","There's no strategy, you just draw cards until you get it, it's simple as that :)  A friendly tip, don't get your cards banished or you might not be able to summon exodia!  My settings for hosting a match so that none of those 1 turn monster decks show up: <ul>  	<li>Banlist: No Banlist</li>  	<li>Allowed Cards: OCG</li>  	<li>Master Rules: Rule 1 (Original)</li>  	<li>Turn Timer: 3 Minutes</li> </ul> Hope this deck helps you.

Weakness is a freaking Kaiju like legit if you get rid of calamitas your extra deck lock is gone.  Also Nibiru hurts the deck i wouldnt say this deck is meta relevant it is weak to handtraps.  Also Dark Ruler No More is GG vs This Deck.

Although the deck doesn't consist of incredibly powerful cards that can win the game in a single attack, it requires careful placement and an effective plan of attack to use effectively.  Atlantean Attack Squad and Mystical Space Typhoon are effective at keeping the board clean while you attempt to build your forces. In the event where Atlantean Attack Squad is destroyed, it can be recovered by using salvage.  A Legendary Ocean and Tornado wall are the driving point of this deck, protecting your weaker monsters such as Starfish and Jellyfish while you prepare to Xyz or tribute summon for Shark Drake or Hyper-Ancient Shark Megalodon.  Before battling take note that Hyper-Ancient Shark is a CRUCIAL unit as its ability to destroy a monster you opponent controls after dealing damage can deal with monsters that are a great deal stronger then it. if it can attack any monster on the field, fish depth charge can deal with them for you or you can power up Megalodon with aqua-jet"

You also have the negations of hand traps to disrupt your opponents plays during their turn. I'm only using the Time Thief Engin to expand plays it is optional to have the Time thief engin.  Keynotes: Hand trap ratios can be changed as well as the extra deck, this is pretty much a budget option to play Zoodiac, at least making the deck viable against the meta. Try using it as a stepping stone to make other Zoodiac decks.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

It is a really good card that literally is an instant Holly angel because it provides 2 tokens. Otherwise it can be used for  more burning if you already have an angel on the field. You can use Set Rotation or Terraforming to get a mystic mine or Trickstar Light Stage to the field, whichever one you need. A play I like to make is using Set Rotation to set Light Stage to my field and Mine to the other when my opponent has more monsters. This way They will either have to activate Mine to get rid of Light Stage, blocking all attacks and monster effects from him, or leave the Mine set, not allowing him to destroy Light Stage.

You can change out the Sky Striker cards, I just used them and they seemed like an extra utility just in case your opponent tried to stop your play. You can also change out Monster Reborn for World Legacy Succession because you can search for it with Worl Legacy - World Crown, but even though that's there, Monster Reborn seemed more versatile than Succession because it doesn't limit you to special summoning to a zone a link monster points to. Back to the Sky Striker cards, the links can be replaced with other cards like Borrelsword Dragon or another boss monster. But normally with this deck, you won't have a turn 3 because you will most likely OTK your opponent.</span>"

Doki Doki is also a recruiter that summons from deck, with a low cost and can be used as an extender  Brilliant Fusion doubles as a free body as well as a foolish for all rocks/Painful Decision  Ties of the Brethren works as a combo finisher (at the end of Union Combo) or as a stun option (worth spending Trinitys on if you want to toolbox)  Last Will helps with Union Combo and toolboxing from deck  Adamancipator Risen - Dragite is a blowout card that can break boards (and gains protection form Block Dragon)  Barrier Statue of the Drought + Koa'ki Meiru Overload is to much for most non Earth decks to handle, and you can turn off your own Barrier by turning it into Gallant"

Ritual summon Vrash with Cyber Petit Angel, Idaten and Diviner in the GY.  Idaten's effect activates, turning your Vrash into a 4k beatstick permanently.  Note that adding 1000 atk to Vrash isn't Vrash's effect, so using impermanence or veiler won't remove it. one of the ways to stop this is by activating Called by the Grave to banish Idaten after the Ritual summon.  &nbsp;  Dragma combo:  Activate Disciples of the Nadir, search for Ecclesia, sending Bastard to the GY  Normal summon Ecclesia, add Dogmatic Nation to the hand  Activate Dogmatic Nation so your opponent will risk losing a monster if they attack Ecclesia  End your turn.

If you don't, just use them to summon our deck boss Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL, and force your opponent to quarantine. And if you had the Generaider Boss Stage, don't worry and use it, so in the opponent turn you can summon a Generaider Boss of your choice and up to 4 Generaider Tokens; you can use the tokens either to use the effects of the Generaider Bosses or to Summon the Trias Hierarchia, Tributing 3 of those tokens you are able to destroy 1 enemy card and also draw 2 Cards.  Another useful combo is summoning Accesscode Talker, if you had in your hand the Effect Veiler, you can normal summon him, and if you already had a monster on the field you can Link Summon the Crystron Halqifibrax, and due to their effect you can bring another Effect Veiler, from you, deck or graveyard, and if you do, use them to special summon Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians, but be aware that you need at least 3 spell cards in the field or both players graveyard, so, you can bring back the Effect Veiler and use them to Link Summon the Accesscode Talker, active their effect in Selene' in order to gain 3000 atk points, and he is also able to destroy up to  2 cards on the field by banishing the 2 link monsters used in this combo. this is a generic combo, but very effective though.  <strong>Deck:</strong> Numeron Generaider Boss. <strong>Type:</strong> Lockdown, <em>OTK</em>. <strong>Difficulty:</strong> 5/10. <strong>Handiness/Consistency:</strong> 6/10 (the first turn matter? yes. How many cards do you need to extract 100% of this deck? 2 initial cards. It is easily counterable? yes). <strong>Draw power: </strong>4/10, Conditional (can I use pot of desires? no). <strong>Recovery:</strong> 2/10. <strong>Comeback:</strong> 4/10. ""This deck is recommended for Medium duelists, <strong>Average final turn: 5</strong>"".  <strong>The perfect initial hand at the first turn:</strong> Numeron Network, Generaider Boss stage, Trias Hierarchia, Memories of Hope, and 1 bait card -like terraforming or planet pathfinder. <strong>The perfect initial hand at Second turn:</strong> Numeron Network, Generaider Boss stage, Dark Ruler no More, Nibiru the primal being, Lightning Storm, and Memories of hope.  so, as you can see, all we need is Numeron Network and Generaider Boss stage, and both are field spells that can be easily searched, by cards like terraforming, planet pathfinder, numeron wall, generaider boss fight, etc.  I hope everyone could enjoy this guide, I pretend to make more guides in the future, If you want to make constructive criticism or add more information, feel free to comment below!

Both of those cards are super easy to fetch, Time Wizard by using Fusion Deployment and Time Magus by Instant Fusion (can be via Verte too, means you can wipe the board anytime with 2 monsters). Going first, we use regular Halqifibrax/Auroradon combo for Borreload Savage and Herald of the Arc Light, while the going second strat has many ways to break the board. The Scrap lineup is very versatile, not only it can go to Halqifibrax, it also provides backup combo while can fetch Time Wizard via Desperado Barrel Dragon for further grindy game.  Mathematician, Scrap Recycler (free link 4 or Verte while searching Time Wizard), Jet Synchron, and Tuning are our starter, making us playing 11 starters. Ghost Ogre (Crossout target, can replace it depends on popularity), 2 )-Lion (ensures Auroradon effect), 2 Time Wizard (easily searchable, its effect aint that good too), Magicalized Fusion (free Time Magus for late game), One Day of Peace (prevents damage from both Time Magus and Wizard), 3 Second Coin Toss (for big brain gamble), Millenium Eyes Restrict (negate discarded monster handtrap), Borreload Dragon (non-targeting non-destruction monster removal), Auroradon (combo piece, non-targeting destruction), Scrap Wyvern (backup combo, non-targeting destruction), Secure Gardna (prevents taking damage, summoned via Linkuriboh), Linkuriboh (enables Jet Synchron to Halqifibrax).  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/0/06/JoeyWheelerDSOD-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent, great going first or second while still have follow up play, have big slot for staples.

Combo videos, explanation of Red-Eyes engine, and budget options in","<strong>Index:</strong>  <u>1 Intro</u>  <u>2 Red-Eyes Engine/cards</u>  <u>3 Combos</u>  <u>4 Budget options</u>  <u>5 Side Deck</u>  <strong> </strong>  <strong>1 Intro</strong>  This is a Dragon Link deck that does Dragon Link deck things but with a Red-Eyes twist added in. Namely, I’ve expanded the Red-Eyes engine in the deck to exploit Black Metal Dragon’s effect not being a hard once per turn. I’ve also updated the deck with Eternity Code’s Noctovision Dragon and found Room to add a couple Pot of Avarices. Pot of Avarice gives the deck a lot more recycling of resources to play longer games than a normal Dragon Link deck would be able to. I have also done an extensive number of test hands to determine that this deck is just as consistent as a conventional competitive Dragon Link deck while making stronger boards.  &nbsp;  <strong>2 Red Eyes Engine/cards</strong>  The Red-Eyes cards are present for the most part not to make a Red-Eyes board but to smooth out or slightly beef up conventional Dragon Link combos. The primary way the deck expects to acquire these cards is by sending Black Metal Dragon to the GY. Red-Eyes Malefic can be used to turn a Romulus into a Hieratic before the deck Dark locks itself. Red-Eyes Alternative exists if you draw the normal Red-Eyes or don’t have a field spell to play Malefic. Red-Eyes Fang with Chain can target Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and add another disruption onto your board.  &nbsp;  I took out Borreload Dragon for a Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon because it fit thematically and there are enough lvl7 monsters to summon him somewhat reliably. That said I’m not sold that this card is actually a good pick and can be replaced with another extra deck monster or the original Borreload Dragon if you aren’t sold on him either.  &nbsp;  <strong>3 Combos</strong>  Here are some Youtube videos of different combos you’ll be looking for in this deck and how to perform them (Each video is about a minute long). Notably these combos are all done with minimum resources and can end on stronger boards with more resources invested.  1 card combo with Black Metal Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TDyHNmjLwA</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Noctovision Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSwGUosIoAo</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Quick Launch  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BUC_x_3lBU</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Absorouter Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny6Rl6a24V4</a>  Playlist with all Combos:  <a>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4wvY6W8_pobhm2edgCy0rZypqEcJbtdX</a>  <strong>4 Budget Options</strong>  3x <u>Dark Ruler No more</u> -&gt; Effect Veiler is a good budget handtrap  3x <u>Called by the Grave</u> -&gt; D.D. Crow. Doesn’t protect your combos but is a really strong affordable hand trap right now.  1x <u>Borreload Savage Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi is much weaker but still provides a strong level 8 synchro disruption to end on.  1x <u>Borrelsword Dragon</u> -&gt; Borreload Dragon  1x <u>Red-Eyes Fang with Chain</u> -&gt; another Red-Eyes B. Dragon or else any other card you so choose. This card should be reprinted in Legendary Duelists: Season 1 so it should come down in price (hopefully).  &nbsp;  Other budget options: Borreload Excharge Dragon, and Borrelguard Dragon, the Topologic Monsters, Galaxy Satellite Dragon, Barricadeborg Blocker, Saryuja, Wee Witch’s Apprentice, and Booster Dragon.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>5 Side Deck</strong>  There are so many options for the side deck at the moment at so many different price points I felt that I didn’t want to hold the deck back or make it really expensive by trying to recommend a specific side deck. Feel free to use whatever tech cards you think are best for current meta.  &nbsp;"

I also put a dragma engine in to deal with threats from the extra deck.,"Using the new Dragma cards as a toolbox, this deck can lock your opponent out of special summoning pretty easily and swarm the field with cyber angels. The Herald of Perfection is used as an omni-negate. what's good about it though is that is isn't once per turn, as long as you have a fairy in your hand. I dislike running too many impcantations as they brick if you don't have a ritual card in your hand. The extra deck is purely used for the Dragmas to destroy (except Herald of Mirage Lights) so don't try to get them on the board!  My rating:  Attack: 5/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 3/5  Strong Against: General decks that love the extra deck, e.g. Salamangreat, Invoked  Weak Against: Altergeist, Mystic Mine Burn/Exodia  Dragma combo:  Activate Disciples of the Nadir, search for Ecclesia, sending Bastard to the GY  Normal summon Ecclesia, add Dogmatic Nation to the hand  Activate Dogmatic Nation so your opponent will risk losing a monster if they attack Ecclesia  End your turn. At the End Phase Bastard in the GY will activate, allowing you to SS Maximus Dragma from the deck.  &nbsp;  Vanity Lock combo:  Get any 2 impcantations onto the field, searching for Benten and/or Machine Angel Ritual if you don't have them  Ritual any monster using Benten as a tribute  Benten's effect now activates, adding a Vanity's Ruler to the hand  Normal summon Vanity's ruler, using the Impcantations as tributes.  Vanity's Ruler stops your opponent from Special Summoning completely, meaning he can't even use Kaijus to get rid of your monsters.  &nbsp;  Also, if you want to add in a Dragma engine into your deck, here it is :  1 Maximus Dragma  2-3 Ecclesia  3 Disciple of the Nadir  1 Dogmatic Nation  1-3 Bastard the Ashen Dragon  1 Psy-framelord Omega (for recycling your cards)  Any removal/versatility that your deck lacks, like N'tss for targeted destruction or Wind Pegasus for a Knightmare Unicorn-like effect.  Hope you like this deck and the Dragma engine! Have fun!"

Now the main card in the deck, dragon ravine, is a dragunity search, a foolish burial for dragons and extends your plays by a lot, just keep sending your tuners to the graveyard and revive them for easy synchros, leyvaten plays a big role in the deck, he can revive himself if there's a equipped dragunity monster on the field, equip a tuner from the gy and go on a level 10 synchro.  Other plays involves dux or senatus and kuse, normal summoning one of the winged beasts guarantees a level 6 or 8 synchro like luin for further plays with kuse, gae bulg for dispaching problem monsters that you can't destroy via effects, gae dearg for adding a level 4 or lower winged beast or dragon at the cost of sending one to the graveyard, vajrayana for other level 8 synchros and crystal wing for negation.  Another layer to the strategy is the dragon ruler in this deck, even at one copy this bad boy can help you in so many ways, searching a wind attribute monster if banished, a dragon type monser if discarded alongside another wind monster and self reviving and returning to the hand, lightning the dragon ruler of draft is for easily bringing out the big guy."

With Generaider as a backup strat, a","So, enough people have been asking for the decklist of the one-Halq four-negates-and-VFD-and-OTK combo I came up with that I decided to upload the more refined version. Long story short: It's a very consistent lockdown that, once put up, could only be brought down with a SuperPoly... but because it's so weak to disruption, about half the deck is dedicated to a Generaider backup strategy and generic disruption of my own.  This is a more refined version of a decklist I posted about a month ago, with some big improvements in the decklist and none in the actual combo.  (Quick breakdown: 20 one-card combo starters, 9 generaider field spells, 14 bricks, 17 disruptions)  ----------------------------  Basically, the whole deck exploits that Halqifibrax is a pseudo-FTK from only one card, and there's so very many cards that do that. So:  -60 cards instead of the usual 39 or 40. Normally, you want small decks so that you draw your best cards, but when you've got several dozen 'best cards', you want as large as you can to avoid drawing the combo bricks.  -Because you don't need to have more than one card for all this, you only need to use half your deck on this, which makes a whole bunch of room for disruptions and backup plays.  -Outside of generic disruption, there's basically only two options for non-normal-summoning, non-ED-using archetypes: Eldlich and Generaider. The advantage with Generaider is that it's *also* a one-card-starter archetype, so it leaves room for a heck-lot of disruption.  Hence, you have a deck that in a 5-card hand has an 88% chance of a pseudo-FTK, and a 57% chance of a Genraider Stage as backup, with an average of 1.4 disruption/going second cards."

Use the Machina monsters and their spell and traps to build field advantage set up bigger and bigger plays. Cards such as Machina overdrive and Machina Citadel to bring out the Meklord Emperors or set up the graveyard. You can also do the reverse and use the Meklords to bring out the Machinas in the graveyard, namely citadel by using the Meklords effects to destroy any earth machine to bring Citadel out of the graveyard or grabbing cards from the graveyard and putting them back into the hand with Machina defence perimeter which can also be used to make your Emperors untargetable by attacks and effects  The deck over all is very consistent and has tons of searching and recovery from all the search cards and recursion cards the two decks bring together."
