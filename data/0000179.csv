It will only perform competitively in the most casual of settings.  <strong>UPDATE 10/25/21: </strong>Embarrassing as they may be, these two early Blue-Eyes White Dragon decks were my re-entry point to playing YuGiOh after nearly 18 years since I last played. In the time since I built this initial deck from a single copy of the Saga of the BEWD structure deck, I've learned the basic theory and game mechanics of YuGiOh and run an incomparably better deck. This is a good reminder that less than six months ago, I didn't know a damn thing about this game."

I’m actually super happy about this new support because I did ask for it before, now that it’s here I’m extremely happy to present to you, deciphering the ciphers (pun COMPLETELY intended)! So I had an overview of the new cards, the new biplane is worth playing triplane of. Double exposure became a 3 of because it wasn’t searchable and did have some neat effects. The cipher interference was actually put at one, the only thing it does is push for game and it’s searchable. For the ciphers that already exist all main deck monsters are at 3 except entangler who’s at one. I put 3 rank up and the traps are mostly useless but one double cipher can be played, if you don’t want to play double cipher you can definitely replace it with upstart goblin. For the extra deck I have 2 X dragon because it self overlays, one Neo cipher because it’s a solid boss to do a very hard push for game, 2 cipher blade dragon for the free rank up, and 3 of the original cipher dragon because that’s what powers up and makes plays for the deck.  For the techs you’ll probably understand most of them but I’ll explain anyways:  Storm cipher has the namesake of the cipher and is searchable via cynet mining, its only there for those reasons  Number 97, 38, and 100 are the dragobulon engine, it’s an otk engine that’s really good because of the sheer amounts of ranks you make in this build.  I also added a utopia engine (with photon) using utopia double, double or nothing, the new version of number 99, photon thrasher, and number 90. Using double to summon number 99 and then summon number 90 with number 99’s effect. Next turn 90 attaches a thrasher from your deck to itself for another negate. This also provides 20 rankings on the field for numeron dragon.  And of course Zeus because that’s the xyz monster to end all xyz monsters.  &nbsp;  I hope you like it! Thanks for reading and I’ll se you next time!"

""Hail to the Deadites"", a documentary that pays homage to the film series and the culture around it, will be released this summer. <a>https://cruellaukraine.wildapricot.org/</a>  The documentary, produced and directed by Steve Villeneuve, is based on several interviews with people who have been involved in the films. Participating are not least the main character Bruce Campbell, but also names like Betsy Baker, Theresa Tilly, Ellen Sandweiss and Ted Raimi. <a>https://conjuring3filmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  At the same time, we get to go to big conventions, where we get to meet a number of dedicated ""Evil Dead"" fans, who talk about their passion for the films . <a>https://conjuring3ukraine.wildapricot.org/</a> In October, it has been 40 years since ""Evil Dead"" first hit theaters, and its popularity and endless cult status have so far resulted in four movies, the TV series ""Ash vs Evil Dead"", comic books and more. By putting a lot of its focus on the fans, ""Hail to the Deadites"" explains why the film series has actually become as beloved as it is.  Check out the trailer for the documentary below: <a>https://aquietplaceukraine.wildapricot.org/</a>  ""Hail to the Deadites"" premiered (and was praised) at the Canadian Fantasia Film Festival in August last year, and is now getting a digital release on July 27.

Or pendulum summon them with the Dragoons of Draconia cards, which also give your normal monsters battle effects! Since rituals and normal monsters have great synergy, I fit in a small ritual engine with Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms to search Knight of Armor Dragon, Sonic Bird to search the ritual art cards, and Nowruz Elise/Armed Dragon Lv5 as special summoning targets.  The 1 Tribute WIND monsters were mainly chosen for their high attack values, but each one has some utility as well.  The one non-WIND tribute monster, Knight of the Red Lotus, is also able to cheat itself out like DAD but for normal monsters.  I don't know why I made this crappy deck!"

Worth looking at if only for the funsies!,"Truly awful with just what they had in Blazing Vortex, Lightning Overdrive brought a lot of much needed support for this archetype.  S/T removal with Mammud and Big Blow and effect negates with Dignity.  Still a very battle focused archetype it can at least stand a bit of a chance against other decks now.  Opening hand should have you opening with Mountain (or Terraforming at the least), and one or two monsters.  The deck certainly has enough searchers in it now to have a consistent opening rip.  Mammud and Orpis can normal themselves with no tribute and Gactos can special himself if you normaled that turn.  Fortia, Wento, and Gactos can search if your opponent sends them by card effect; Fortia to hand, Wendo and Gactos special summon.  Two Extravagance for slightly more consistence and Cross Over to help remove monsters.  Big Blow is essentially an archetype Heavy Storm Duster when your opponent makes a War Rock leave the field: basically everything except for battle destruction as it can only be activated in the Main Phase).  I use Spirit as a Battle Phase Monster Reborn but I am sure other people smarter than me could make better use for it.  Extra deck is all Link Monsters for various toolbox needs you might have but I think putting some XYZ Monsters in wouldn't be a bad idea.  I just am not sure which.  Side deck isn't anything special, Monster Reborn, Expendable Dai, and Mind Crush I'm all a little iffy on.  Alternates I would put in are a third Solemn Judgment and Infinite Impermanence.  The rest of the deck are all staple powerhouses.  Some fine tuning can be done if you feel.  I think it's actually not a completely awful deck now.  &nbsp;  EDIT: Removed two Borrelswords for Verte Anaconda and Dragoon.  Moved Pots to side deck; added third Judgment as well.  Added third Dignity to main deck as well as RE Fusion, Dragon, and DM."

Keeper of the Shrine can be tributed to normal summon out Diabolos or Dark Horus from the hand.  Ahrima and Lilith tribute themselves and bring out Diabolos from the hand or GY.  By using Lilith's effect to choose the 2 viruses (or InfImp) we want and trap trick, we can always get the virus we need while only main decking 2 copies of each, saving deck space. Virus cards give info, rip cards from the opponent's hand, and can tribute our opponent's monsters while we have Lair of Darkness active.  Lair of Darkness also allows the deck to reliably use Super Polymerization to fuse away 2 or 3 of the opponent's monsters into Predaplant Triphyoverutum or Starving Venom Fusion Dragon at spell speed 4.  I would love to hear any suggestions to improve the deck!"

Here we meet Usnavi (played by Anthony Ramos) who leads the audience through his sun-drenched neighborhood of Washington Heights, where song, dance and flirty glances are found around every corner. <a>https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/27110-unnamed-draft</a>  ""In the Heights"" is the Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda (""Hamilton"", you know) which is now being directed by Jon M.

Participating are not least the main character Bruce Campbell, but also names like Betsy Baker, Theresa Tilly, Ellen Sandweiss and Ted Raimi. <a>https://sessizbiryer2film.wildapricot.org/</a>  At the same time, we get to go to big conventions, where we get to meet a number of dedicated ""Evil Dead"" fans, who talk about their passion for the films.  <a>https://archello.com/brand/der-streaming-guide-von-fast-and-furious-9</a>"

Dangers! can out themselves.  Also both are targets for allure and Trade-In. Solemn and Ash for defense.  Perfect opening board is 2 beasts with fallen paradise and Awakening of the Sacred Beasts to create a skill drain effect. Main extra deck cards are Armityle and Almiraj.  Almiraj is to get Beckoning Beast in the GY so it can be a target when you use Spirit Gate to pitch Dark Summoning beast.
