With this deck beat your opponent as fast as you can while throwing monkey wrenches into your opponent's plans using Cosmic Cyclone, Bubble Barrier, and Performance Hurricane. (Mimiclay is not the best option for this deck, but you might want to try it out!)  Use Performapal U Go Golem's ability to summon the Extra Deck cards on your command.

This is done by destroying cards your opponent controls during both player's turns while you preferably control 3 or more Fur Hire monsters. This is done by the effects of twin twisters and special summoning Fur Hires while you control Donpa or Recon with Mayham Fur Hire and No. 29, ect.  Remember this deck is fragile as its a glass cannon so preferable go 1st game 1 set a decent board and get a destruction effect during opponent's turn and repeat.

Dawn Dragster"" and ""Rafal, Champion Fur hire"". so yea you just sit on dragun plus any other negates that you have. you also wanna make sure that your opponent can't hand trap you as well, which is what Restrict is for. anyway this is REALLY!! good and i hope you guys have a fun time messing around with this deck. as you guys know it is my mission to make ""Fur Hire""s good again and if not, just good in general. and even if my Orcust variation is busted now since the new banlist. i feel like i have broken new boundaries thanks to ""Dragun of Red-Eyes"" and if dragun of red-eyes does get banned, then i'll find another way to get around it. that is why i like this game, because it is so adaptable to the current game."

The basics like gadgets and Galaxy Soldier are still here to start the same loops that the classic builds.  &nbsp;  So the specific cards you'll find are :  The Psy-Frame package, that is usefull to negate an Ash Blossom targetting a draw card or Terraforming/Union Hangar to have 2 monsters to start boards pretty effectively, or just use Psy-Frame Lambda's ability to negate cards during your opponent's turn to add disruption to your established board. Note that they are light attribute and are potential targets for Galaxy Soldier's effect.  The Sky Striker package is really good in this deck sinse it can search out multiple Sky Striker cards and cycle the deck when having good effects to handle the opponent's board. Kagari is a machine monster and can be used to summon Platinum Gadget. With Sky Striker Mecha - Shark Canon and Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor you can handle annoying monsters in the graveyard or in the field like Plasma Destiny Hero, and steal opponent's monsters to rapidly gain access to Avramax and Borrelsword for OTK strategies.  Monster Gate can deblock hands by sending somme letters to the graveyard that would trigger summoning or searching effects and can bring out monsters like Silver Gadget or Gold Gadget to spam the board and gain access to ABC Dragon Buster even with a bricky hand. Note that you can send spells to the graveyard and instantly gain acces to the full power effects of the Sky Striker cards.  Twin Twisters are Added main deck to send a needed letter to the graveyard and break backrow cards and floodgates that could stop the deck in some situations.  The extra deck is quite generic, we Simply run a Gear Gigant X to search the last letters for the summoning of ABC Dragon Buster, and Crusadia Equimax to have a simple way to summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with the Sky Striker combos or bypass the biggest beatsticks and potentially gain access to simple OTKs.  &nbsp;  The side deck :  Dark Ruler No More is a great card against combo decks like Guardragons and won't be negated by Mystical Beasts monsters from Pendulum decks, it's also a spell card so it will allow us to triger the full power effect of Sky Striker cards more easilly.  Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners is an alternative way to handle monsters and is a safe way to break through monsters that prevent special summons like Vanity Fiend or monsters with annoying disruption effects to start our loops, it is searchable by Engage.  <span>Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay is a good way to draw cards when going second against decks like Orcust, and can pressure opponent's play that set monsters with disruption effects</span>  The artifact package is an excellent option to lock combo decks when going first with Artifact Scythe and can stop Orcust and Thunder Dragon with Artifact Lancea.  Lastly Anti-Spell Fragrance is a way to shut down Sky Striker and Pendulum when going first and won't be a problem after we set our board."

They don't make the most impressive boards but can make some that easily win you the game (They also have a OTK, for those who want). This Dino deck really depends on going second and going first with the wrong cards in your hand can hurt sometimes.  Lost World Dino is one of my favorite decks and I will show you why. Dino's have a very simple strategy; putting big beatsticks and negates on the board. This is mostly possible with ULTIMATE CONDUCTER TYRANNO, the EVOLZAR duo and PANKRATOPS. The main plays start with OVIRAPTOR and a combination of MISCELLANEOUSAURUS and/or LOST WORLD in your hand, this is why you play 3 FOSSIL DIG to search you combo starters. I play 6 handtraps to disrupt opponents plays and 2 to get rid of powerfull boss monsters.  The OTK is having an token on your opponents field with LOST WORLD (OTK is still possible without token, you opponent just needs a monster on their side of the field), getting DUGARES on the board with UCT, activating DUGARES's effect to double UCT's attack, linking DUGARES and another card away for PENTESTAG (that points to UCT), destroy a monster in your hand to change your opponents monsters to face down defense position, attack every monster with UCT for 7000 piercing dmg (and directly after all monsters are gone.

It has a problem establishing strong first turn boards. I also tried a Zombieworld variant but ended up liking this build better. Vampire Sucker can take advantage for Zombie World but I just never ended up using her opponent's monster tributing effect. For me Vampire Kingdom felt to work better. I also like this version better because it focuses more on the actual vampire cards. Vampire Fraulein and Vampire Domination are probably my favorite cards of the Deck.

This deck doesn't have a side deck because I am still kind of new to yu-gi-oh, I am not the best at swapping cards from my decks, I try to put in any cards that counter other cards in right away, I don't know what kind of cards to counter directly, and I always go for the max of 60 cards in the main deck."

Any hand that opens with at least 1 Mekk, 1 Traptrix, and 1 spell/trap is capable of creating a somewhat strong opening board.  Going first your best bet is to establish a column by turning any main deck Traptrix monster into Sera and using any spell/trap to create an opening for your Mekk-knights to be summoned. Once you've done most of your Mekk-knight plays, you can either turn any level 4s on the field into a Traptrix Rafflesia or a Time Theif Redoer or using 3 cards to create BLS - Soldier of Chaos. This deck is capable of opening only monsters or only spell/traps, but it is usually a healthy mix of both.  The best hand I've experienced with this deck was:  Myrmeleo, Purple Nightfall, Kagetokage, Shade Brigandine, and Secret."

That's what I did here, using the Arcana Force archetype for the Main Deck, and mostly filling my Extra Deck with Utopia monsters.  Adding Ties of the Brethren, Shining Angel and Nova Summoner for a bit of consistency, this deck is meant to use these Level 4 LIGHT Fairy monsters to Summon the various Utopia forms and hopefully bring victory. With 'Utopia Double' and 'Double or Nothing!' included in the deck, an OTK is possible if the opponent controls an ATK position monster with max 2000 ATK. Honest can help make an OTK, such as this one, easier. Note that Honest cannot be used in conjunction with Utopia the Lightning's effect, as Lightning's ATK change happens after the final chance to activate Honest."

Going first you can go 1 of 2 ways: 1) If you know your facing a Nibiru, make Apollousa by 5th summon. You can use will, archiver, and your natural extenders to do this. 2) If you know there's no nibiru, just perform the standard salamangreat combo, you should be able to end on 2 negates on field and at least 1 hand trap in the hand for 3 disruptions. Ghost belle is a very strong hand trap this format, being able to hit every one of the top decks. Orcust- stops cymbal skeleton and Yellow Martin for the LunaLight build. Strikers- Stops raye and kagari. Salamangreats- what doesn't it stop? Thunder- Stops hawk preventing the thunder player from extending combo.  &nbsp;  The side deck is more diverse able to handle a wider variety of decks. Red reboot would be your flex spot, if you feel like adding a 3rd twin twisters or another sanctum feel free. You'll notice no nibiru, this is because nibiru isn't really as strong as you'd believe right now. Its a blow-out vs rogue decks but hurts the meta decks very little. If you disagree, you're welcome to experiment with it, I feel its a waste of space better used for more effective hand traps or stun cards like the artifact package. I have included trap trick in the side deck as a 3rd sanctum. The idea behind this is that trap trick is a way to thin 2 cards from your deck upon activation. Even if you open with sanctum and trap trick, you can use the card to grab an impermanence and thin 2 cards from your deck and increase consistency."

Desde Yu-Gi-Oh!GX, quando o Jaden Yuki invocava aquelas lindas fusões clássicas, sempre tive um enorme desejo em fazer esse deck, ao qual, admiro muito.  Bem, pra quem não sabe, o deck gira em torno de monstros do tipo guerreiro, dos mais variados atributos, que envolve principalmente invocação do deck extra de monstros fusão, sendo eles definidos nas seguintes tipos de HERO: <ul>  	<li>Herói Elementar</li>  	<li>Herói do Destino</li>  	<li>Herói Mascarado</li>  	<li>Herói da Visão</li>  	<li>Herói Maléfico</li>  	<li>Neospacial</li>  	<li>Herói Xtra</li> </ul> E bem, e a mecânica do deck é até que muito boa, no qual você busca as suas matérias de fusão e pelos mais variados efeitos, busca meios de usa-las para trazer seus HEROS mais fortes. E por muito tempo, o deck foi bem abalado, tendo a carta ""Um Herói Vive"" limitada, e só recentemente, o Herói do Elemento Stratos saiu completamente da banlist, após quase 5 anos banido/limitada, e claro, o Herói do Destino - Malicioso, que com mais uma cópia, te dá acesso a mais combos e monstros a serem trazidos.  O seu campo Core, é sempre passar o turno, se for você quem começa, com um Herói Destino - Plasma, que nega todos os efeitos de monstros de face pra cima no campo do oponente, uma habilidade extremamente forte, forçando seu oponente a ter que interagir com você e gastar recursos, e mais um monstro para se dar a Mudar a Máscara, que vai ser setada e utilizada no turno do oponente, com o objetivo de trazer a Lei Negra, o Herói Mascarado, que todas as cartas do oponente são banidas em vez de ir pro cemitério, e claro, a sua habilidade de que se o oponente adiciona cartas na mão do deck, ele descartar uma carta, o que faz o seu oponente perder ainda mais recursos. Também pode se por um Herói do Destino - Distopia sendo apontado pelo Herói Xtra Dizimador Horrífico, que aumenta o atk dele e de monstros HERO em suas zonas em 100 pra cada HERO de nome diferente no cemitério, e claro, Distopia destrói qualquer carta no turno de qualquer jogador, contanto que ele esteja com o atk alterado, o que é sempre bom ter em mãos, o Neos Honesto, para dar muito atk as seus HEROS, servindo tanto para bater no seu oponente, como para defender seus HEROS.  E como jogando por segundo, fazendo os mais variados combos para trazer o Herói Elementar Sunriser que te dá acesso à Fusão Miraculosa, podendo assim trazer o Herói Elementar Zero Absoluto usando o Herói Elementar Liquidman e outro Herói Elementar, para se dar uma Mudar a Máscara no Zero Absoluto, com o objetivo de ""triggar"" os efeitos do Zero Absoluto e o Herói Mascarado Acid,  que, quando Zero Absoluto saí do campo ele destrói todos os monstros do oponente, ""trigga"" o efeito do Acid, que quando entra no campo, destrói todas as cartas mágicas e armadilhas do oponente, deixando o campo livre para um OTK, sendo para mim, um dos combos mais fortes dos HEROS.  O deck ainda irá receber os futuros suportes, mas o que já se percebe, que o deck de HERO chegou chegando, e vai causar bastante barulho, muito certamente."

The ""Kaiju"" cards are a good way of wiping out monsters and getting a better board for you. For example: if you have ""Gameciel, the sea turtle kaiju"" and ""Jizukiru, the star destroying kaiju"" in your hand while your opponent controls a monster, you can tribute ur opponents monster to summon gameciel to their field and u can now special summon jizukiru, who has 3300 ATK while gameciel has 2200 ATK.U know what to do now."

You also want to see it as it can battle monsters that cant be destroyed by battle, by instead banishing them for the phase.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Knight(x2) <ul>  	<li>This is at 2 because you dont want to see it in your hand as much due to it being a brick. You want to search this card from the effect of Galaxy Soldier (you should discard Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon for the effect of Galaxy Soldier). This card does take up a normal summon from you but in return can summon another level 8 for you to go into your XYZ monsters.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Soldier(x3) <ul>  	<li>One of the best cards in the main deck as it allows you discard a card to special summon itself and search a ""Galaxy"" monster. This card will generally be summoned by discarding Galaxy-Eyes Photon dragon to search Galaxy Knight, assuming that you have not normal summoned prior to Galaxy Soldiers special summon. Having more than 2 Galaxy Soldiers can also result in you summoning Cyber Dragon Infinity.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Wizard(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card is your main normal summon and a great card for searching and setting up. This card can also turn into a level 8 thus helping you with your XYZ summons. Futhermore if able to summon this card, with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in the GY and Photon Vanisher or and other body on the field, then you can tribute Galaxy Wizard and search Galaxy Trance which you can make Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord. On your opponents turn you can search Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon via Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lords second effect. This gives you two distruptions on the field and and other such as Tachyon Transmigration.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Orbital(x3) <ul>  	<li>Now we get into cards which are mainly used for utility. This card just gives a free search which this deck likes. This card can also be used as Galaxy Soldier's discarder or Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon's discarder.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Vanisher(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card allows the deck to basically get a free Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon in your hand. This helps alot and can even be used to special summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon or Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon. This card can be used as discard material.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Main Deck(Spells) - <ul>  	<li>Accellight(x1) <ul>  	<li>Acts as the 4th copy of Galaxy wizard and shall only be used for the purpose. (That's how good Galaxy Wizard is in this deck).</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Expedition(x3) <ul>  	<li>This card Extends your plays and I just cant see why you wont run 3 of this. This card and Galaxy Wizard is a free Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Trance(x2) <ul>  	<li>This card is <em><strong>EXTREMELY GOOD </strong></em>but we only run two because it's a card you want to search off Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord as a way to get an XYZ monster after your opponent destroys all your cards (if they do). The card can also be bricky as you may have no way to send Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon to the GY.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Monster reborn(x1) <ul>  	<li>Extender.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Photon Sanctuary(x3) <ul>  	<li>A free Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon, allowing you to summon more XYZ monsters from the Extra Deck</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Return Of The Dragon Lords(x3) <ul>  	<li>A better monster reborn as it protects your Link and XYZ monsters</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Trade-In(x3) <ul>  	<li>Pot of Greed is banned and this card allows you to get your Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from your hand to the GY. If you bricked and you have Trade-In, Photon Vanisher and a card you can normal summon, it will make you refresh your hand with some bodies on the field.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy Zero(x1) <ul>  	<li>You can summon XYZ monsters for free and the XYZ summon using them and bypass Galaxy Zero's effect or this card can be used to extend. This card is not searched usually and you want it late game.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Called By The Grave(x3) <ul>  	<li>Your deck does search and can be irritated by hand traps. But you can still play on even if your opponent has a hand trap. This card is just here for extra backup and support. It can also be used to distrupt your opponent on their turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Main Deck(Traps) - <ul>  	<li>Tachyon Transmigration(x3) <ul>  	<li>A negate dedicated for Galaxy-Eyes, why not run 3?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Extra Deck <ul>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card destroys a card and can summon a Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon. So summon Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon (Effect: Steal a monster from your opponent) &gt;&gt; XYZ summon into Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon (Effect: Destroy a monster) &gt;&gt; XYZ summon into Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon (Effect: Destroy a card). But you cant attack.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>Good for XYZ summoning better XYZ monsters and can control the field with its effect.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>Good for destroying monsters... also has 4000 ATK</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>A great card for battle negation and for Tachyon Tansmigration.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card can gain big attack for OTKs.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord(x2) <ul>  	<li>The card you'll summon the most. This card is a negation and a searcher. You must run 2 minimum.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card can make it the focus of attacks and negate spell cards which are used a lot in decks.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand(x1) <ul>  	<li>Great for protection or negation</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Thunder End Dragon(x1) <ul>  	<li>This card should be a card of your choice. Maybe a Rank 4 or a Link monster (Borrelsword)</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Number 97: Draglubion(x1) <ul>  	<li>Unless you've been restricted by card effects which have stated that you cannot summon other monsters except light monsters, this card is great as with its effect you can summon Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon and used its effect to have 7200 ATK for OTKs. (This card replaced Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon. RIP Dark Matter, your fellow Galaxy-Eyes XYZ monsters missing you)</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Nova(x1) <ul>  	<li>To summon Cyber Dragon Infinity</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Infinity(x1) <ul>  	<li>A great negation on the field.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon(x2) <ul>  	<li>This is your Link card and you'll be summoning this card the most as well to get more XYZ monsters on the field. Its summoning effect allows you to get back a card which it mainly would be (in order of piority): <ol>  	<li>Galaxy Solider (for Cyber Dragon Infinity)</li>  	<li>Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon(For its own effect). (This can also be 1st place just depends on the situation)</li>  	<li>Photon Orbital (if used as material for the Link summon or sent to the GY as a discarder) so you can use its search effect</li>  	<li>Any Photon or Galaxy monster for (its own effect again)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Side Deck <ul>  	<li>Personally, I think you should make it yourself. Not because im lazy. Look above, I did all of that typing for you.

But this time both of them will be supported by the recently released <em>Curse Necrofear</em> and the Dark Spirits from <em>Legendary Duelists: Immortal Destiny</em>. Foremost by the Dark Spirits - their effects allow us to special summon those heavy hitters Emperor and Empress from the grave during the damage step if your enemy attacks or if your enemy activates an effect, after you discarded them for twin twister for board clear or searching costs for the also new released <em>Dark Spirit's Mastery </em>spell<em>. </em>And don't worry about them effectless - you extend your board with the help from <em>Archfiend Palabyrinth</em>.  The Extra Deck choices are kind of optional, because <em>Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror </em>only allows other fiend-type Monsters in his entourage, but Monsters like <em>Number 49: Fortune Tune </em>and<em> Wind-Up Zenmaines </em>can help you stall for a while, if you bricked a little. And with their effects they can also get off <em>Archfiend Heiress </em>search effect. Except <em>Coral Dragon</em>, which is a good card, let's you draw and you can go for higher Synchro Monsters if you want, the others are Archfiend Cards, which can later be used for the effect of <em>Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror </em>and <em>Archfiend's Roar </em>(which is also a Archfiend Card for Emperor).  At the moment I have no clue what to put into the Side Deck, because in the current Meta Archfiends have not the slightest chance to compete."

Experiment-XYZ (Going Second),"Alright so the story behind this deck concept is that I had a fan named Experiment-XYZ reach out to me on discord telling me he really enjoyed playing my Musket Shaddoll list which made me feel great that I have people who appreciate my hard work for the community. He asked me, why not do a Magical Musket Invoked variant too? And I was like, yeah thats something I didn't think of that could be a really cool concept. Big shoutout to Experiment for coming up with this concept idea and allowing me to make it a reality! I love it when fans reach out to me, even just to tell me that they really like my decks. Because Aleister is an additional normal summon I only wanted to play 1 since we don't want to open many normal summons. The main target for <a data-name=""Inovcation"">Invocation</a> is the Aleister link two, <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker of Madness"">Aleister The Invoker of Madness</a>. The reason for the second Invocation in the side deck is in case your opponent is playing the Invoked engine, this way having two Invocation means you can use their graveyard and their Aleister(s) to fusion summon with as fusion materials. My ratios for the Musket cards have already been explained in my previous Musket builds I have posted. The Cyber Dragon package is insane. While testing I knew that a lot of people are in fear of <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> in this format because it can wipe your opponent's entire board via contact fuse if they are playing Orcust or any machine deck, or, also just wiping their extra monster zone can be enough to tear right through your opponent's board. I really like <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> because it gets rid of your opponent's support cards permanently so you don't have to deal with them later on in the game, like <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>. My last comment I want to make is that I know the side deck is a little weird but it works. This deck is specifically for going second to break boards and Stun / OTK your opponent. But the side deck prepares you to go first as well in case they force you to go first and you know they will like if you win the die roll and you force them to go first, then game 2 they're going to make you go first since you purposely picked to go second the first time. The reason for 2 Nibiru and 1 Artifact Lancea is because I wanted to have multiple options for interruption cards since Nibiru is a hard once per turn, if you draw Nibiru and Lancea you can use both instead of being stuck with 2 Nibiru. It's more of a logical strategy that I came up with. Again, shoutout to Experiment-XYZ for helping out with this deck profile and I hope to see you guys stick around for more awesome decks!"
