It does have a slight inconsistency issue in that you dont so much get to search the cards you want but excavate them which can be a tad unreliable which is why I can't label this a tier 1 deck. You want to run a lot of rock monsters to really maximize your chances of excavating a rock monster. The extra deck is diverse to pile on negations, can perform hand loops, and can even lock your opponent out of special summoning on their turn.

You special summon the higher lvl (boss-)monsters/masters by tributing the low lvl students in addition of discarding a spellcard. They cost seems to be high, but don't worry, the discarded spellcards, you haven't activated the same turn, will come back from the graveyard to your hand or direct on the field. You also have multiple layer of protection, negation- and destruction- effect, removal and recovery options.  This specific profile don't use ""Pod of Extravagance"" and ""Magician's Souls"" wich other build prefers, cause of budget reasons. The Deck performce very well without them and have a good consistentcy by it self. Beside the already mentioned spellcard recycling mechanic, i built in much drawcards. Together with ""Spell Chonicle"" and the new trap ""Witchcrafter Patronus"" you can generate a big card advantage, especially in the lategame."

With that combo alive, it makes Valkyr","Should this site change to EDOPRODECK? Hmm. Anyway the recent EDOPRO (previously YGOPRO Percy) simulator now can work with Mischief of the Time Goddess, making playtesting full power Valkyrie with future/prereleased cards possible. Basic combo is to OTK your opponent using Time Goddess (double battle phase) or Borrelsword Dragon for easier setup. Going first, we can make Apollousa or True King of All Calamities from Diviner of the Heralds. The combo is normal summon Diviner, dump Trias Hierarchia, use Trias tribute Diviner ss Trias, use Diviner ss Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, overlay Trias and Sigrun for True King of All Calamities.  The Valkyrie cards ratio is medium because most of them are not too good, only some you wanna see the most, also we dont rely on Ride of the Valkyries that much as it makes our monsters shuffled to the deck going first (doesnt even worth the no damage taken for 2 turns). One copy of Time Goddess because its searchable and mostly a dead card (we can OTK with Borrelsword anyway).  The supports: Hecatrice + Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen (free fairy, triggers our Sechste too), Galaxy Cyclone and Night Beam (backrow pops, work with Vierte as both are normal spell, similar to D-Hero Diamond Dude but faster), One for One (for Sechste, Vierte target), Raigeki and Herald of the Abyss (monster pops, Vierte target, we didnt play Lightning Storm as it conflicts with Valhalla), double Dark Ruler No More (only 2 cus while we can do 2 battle phase, this card makes us unable to OTK cus no damage on first battle phase), Reasoning (mainly for Sechste, our Valkyries have different level too), Pots (can be Desires, Extrav, or anything, Valkyrie deck needs so many draw/search cards as much as possible), Monster Reborn and World Legacy Succession (extender, possibly triggering our Valkyries from GY), Tuner's High (Diviner searcher by using Sechste as fodder). Can put Utopia Double if you want but it will be very dependent on our hand.  Extra deck: We're using Extravagance, means multiple copies of our important cards.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/txgCsBr.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Going first is much stronger than previous build, have multiple ways of OTK (more if with Utopia Double), bunch of removal/breaking board cards, can put in handtraps.  Cons: Only has Diviner as great starter (other ways we might need extenders), Ride of the Valkyries is very bad on first turn (it means drawing multiple Valkyries going first is kinda bricky sometimes).  Cards to think of: Honest (great card but dead going first and we can just remove opponents monster anyway), other Valkyrie related spells (some arent that good and some only provides small advantage), Parshath supports (the link 3, the level 9, and the continuous spell can be good in recycling our Valkyries if we play grindy games)"

Broken control, broken recovery, broken general support, broken generic cards... This deck is by far one of the most degenerate and evil decks I have ever played. It was only a matter of time before people figured out how to secure this deck a spot in the meta... and it turns out that embracing the fact Eldlich is a trap deck is the way to do it. After studying and mastering this not so difficult to play deck, I have realized just how easy and fun it is to watch your opponent squirm and rage trying to get rid of the incredible recursion offered by this archetype's spells and traps. The fact that this deck doesn't require a normal summon adds further insult to injury in the fact that you can run 3 more mini-skill drains in the form of inspector boarder, which also happens to have 2000 attack which can come in handy when you're grinding your opponent into submission, oh by the way, did I mention the deck doesn't require a normal summon? Because going second you can just side in lava golems and sphere modes and let your opponent kiss their 30 minute board setup goodbye.  P.S. This deck is reallllllyyyy easy to play, but if you can't figure it out on your own feel free to reply and I'll see what I can do or like this post and give me clout and I might make a tutorial video. (It might be pretty boring and short considering this isn't exactly a combo deck)"

It is a beatdown,"Hello,  I have been playing Ancient Warriors since they were released in IGAS and have put many hours in to playing them in locals and online games. This is what I believe to be the most consistent way to play the deck at the moment.  I will do a basic overview on the main goal of the deck - you very much have to play with the hand you get and work out which path is the best to take. It can struggle going first but as most decks do, it you get the right cards you will be able to set up a bit of a headache for your opponent.  So it is a blind second deck with the focus on getting multiple AW's on the field. Three Visits is the card you want to see in your hand every time as this really allows you to play. Going second this combined with Loyal Guan Yun gets you a beater with a pop on to the field and the ability to search for another AW.  If you are still outnumbered by the opponent Virtuous Liu Xuan will gain you further advantage by being able to special summon out another AW - usually this will be Masterful Sun Mou.  Sun Mou in my opinion is the best monster in this deck. His search ability sends as cost so combined with Three Visits and an AW in hand, even if you dont get to search you should get the special summon. More often than not off Sun Mou's search you will be adding Valiant Zhang De as by this point you should have 2 AW's on field to make use of his ss ability.  Zhang De summon can be used to trigger Sun Mou's bounce effect which really starts giving some pressure. Speaking of Mou's bounce effect, in the battle phase with Liu Xuan in play, you can attack with Mou to trigger Xuan, draw 1, then trigger Mou to bounce before the attack goes through (if you haven't already bounced this turn).  Graceful Zhou Gong is ok. He is very situational but does allow the deck to OTK by using his search effect to get Ancient Warrior Saga - Sun-Liu Alliance to hand. If you are taking this route you will have most likely gone second and be out numbered by your opponent and either special summoned it with Xuan or by popping Three visits to special summon it from hand. I never find it worth while to normal summon him unless you have Three Visits and need the search for a second AW.  With Gong and hopefully 2 other AW's on field you will be able special summon Zhang De to trigger some effects including Alliance which will give them all a 1200 atk boost and should give the OTK.  &nbsp;  The Draco engine in this deck really gives it the consistency it needs and the ability to cause more problems to the opponent. Not only does it have great synergy with the AW's ability to send cards to the graveyard, the added backrow and monster removal its a great equaliser and the search from Heritage and Disciples comes up more than you would expect. Also being able to summon Dinomight and Ignis on your opponents turn and pop a monster with Apocalypse is very handy.  Nibiru and Gameciel are musts in most going second decks and with the amount of combo and break my board decks they are really handy. A great interaction between Sun Mou and Gameciel is that you can use Gameciel to tribute a troublesome card, Mou effect to bounce it back to hand and then use Gameciel once more to get rid of a second card.  Metaverse and Mystic Mine are insanely helpful especially when you are waiting on one more piece to allow you to push for game. With many cards in deck that will allow you to get rid of your own mine, it is just an added level of protection incase you dont get the cards you needed.  Many decks you will see will run Fire Formation - Tensu for the extra normal summon, personally i found this card to be a brick / do nothing card most of the time so chose to run Gyokkou instead. The ability to shut down a backrow spot and force your opponent to use resorces to deal with it is insane and when anti spell is sided in you can lock down important combo starters ect. I know this is a point people will disagree with me on, but if you feel strongly about it then you can always side it for going first, however it is a brick when you cant use it.  I hope this helps anyway, once the new support comes out a pure version might be more conisitent and powerful than this, but I will continue to play test and deck build and hopefully will post another one once the cards are released and I have had time to play with it all."

It's about as field-nukey as field nuking can get. The original Demise is not once per turn, so you can keep blowing the field up if your opponents has floaters, as long as you have the life points. Big Demise is a nuke with no cost most of the time. Ruin is okay, she's mainly there for OTKing, especially the big one. It is a ritual deck, so it's about as consistent as any deck can get (that's a joke, by the way. Rituals have never been consistent without being broken, look at Gishki and Nekroz). The two normal monsters are there for Advanced Ritual Art. Since there's no real way to summon them, I just picked two that I like. There's no extra deck, because this deck doesn't really keep up enough field presence to have one. It's an absolute blast to play, because who doesn't like blowing up a field your opponent spent five minutes making?"

Card advantage is how TYZ is able to get a leg up on other decks and overwhelm them Non-effect monsters and synchros. The main play of the deck is to use one of the 3 one card starters (Souleating Oviraptor, Draconnet, Mathematican) to synchro summon Denglong and search Nine Pillars (Pro tip don't set backrow until you search Nine Pillars to ensure your opponent doesn't know where you set it). Then afterwords, use Denglong's effect to send a Tenyi from deck to GY (the best one to send, most of the time, is Ashuna) (BTW the level change isn't that important). Then on the opponent's turn negate something with Pillars and off of denlong being sent to GY summon Bi'an, then you revive Denlong with either Buddy Force or Back to the Front, use denlong to search Yang Zing Path (for card advantage), and when you see an opportunity use Bi'an to synchro with Denlong into Baxia and shuffle 2 cards on the opponent's field (Pro tip don't chain Bi'an to a card effect because if you do Baxia will miss timing, also Bi'an gives Baxia battle protection). That's the main bread and butter combo of the Deck that's a +2 in card advantage and gives you a way to recycle the Yang Zings (and draw 2) and puts a Tenyi in the GY. Trinitys: Trap Trick &amp; Draco Masters, Denglong &amp; Vessel, and Nine Pillars"

Send ""supreme king dragon darkwurm"" and we use his effect in GY. We SS him and we use his second effect. We add to hand ""supreme king gate zero"". Nowe we activate ""black fang magician"" in pendulum zone. We use ""duelist alliance"" and we add "" Pendulum Call"". We use "" Pendulum Call"" we discard ""supreme king gate zero"" and add ""Oafdragon Magician"" and ""harmonizing magician"". We activate ""Oafdragon Magician"" in second pendulum zone. Nowe we pendulum summon 2 ""harmonizing magician"" and we use effect one of them. We SS ""black fang magician"" from deck. On 1 ""harmonizing magician"" and ""black fang magician"" we SS ""crystron needlefiber"" from extra deck and  we use his effect we SS ""jet synchron"". On ""crystron needlefiber"" we SS ""linkross"" we use his effect SS 2 tokens. ON 1 token and ""jet synchron"" we SS ""formula synchron"" we draw 1 card. Nowe on ""formula synchron"" and token we SS ""tin musical battlemech"" and we use his effect we SS ""formula synchron"" from GY. On ""linkross"" and ""formula synchron"" we SS ""predaplant verte anaconda"". On ""supreme king dragon darkwurm"" and ""harmonizing magician"" we SS ""union carrier"". We use ""union carrier"" effect on  ""predaplant verte anaconda"" and we equip him using ""dragon buster destruction sword"".

On ""tin musical battlemech"" and ""jet synchron"" we SS ""I:P Masquerena"". Nowe we use ""Oafdragon Magician"" effect in pendulum zone and we add ""harmonizing magician"" to hand. Finally we use ""predaplant verte anaconda"" and we SS ""dragun of red eyes"". In the next turn we use ""I:P Masquerena"" effect  on ""I:P Masquerena"" and ""union carrier"" we SS ""mekk knight crusadia avramax"". In the next turn more Dragun and what you need :)  Pay attention to this: if enemy will destroy our ""dragun of red eyes"" we can simply resurrect him. We can activate ""black fang magician"" in pendulum zone and reduce the attack one opponent's monster then we can SS ""dragun of red eyes"" from GY. Small synergy but enjoys ;)  For the introduction of this archetyp in 2020 year asked me one of the users of this page. I tried to change as little as possible from old deck list, but modern ygo is guided by its own laws. I hope you like it. This is not the final form of this deck yet, but thanks to this you can do it yourself or wait for update.  Side deck is just an example of what can be useful.  &nbsp;"

Better to go second deck.  Best starting hand would be: 1 Rescue Rabbit, 1 G.B. Comeback, and the third and possibly a neccessary fourth card can be a few different card(s), but your first main goal is to get Test Panther and one Gladiator Beast on the field, along with having two other Gladiator Beasts that are in your hand and/or your GY with the GY being more preferable.  The best way to OTK:  Use a rescue animal to get two Andal's/Samnite's on your field and either use double summon, instant fusion an Essedarii/Thousand Keys (Definitely the least preferable option.  You'll understand why later.), Unexpected Dai an Andal (before the rescue animal), etc. to get three monsters total on the field.  If you used Rescue Rabbit and get just one Andal in your hand as well, you can link summon Link Spider with one of the Rabbit's Andal's and then use Link Spider's ability to Special Summon the Andal in your hand.  There are quite a few possible ways to do this, some scenarios can even get four or more monsters on your side of the field before the next step, but if you have enough Gladiator Beast monsters in your hand to pull off the next few steps efficiently, the best option is to use Mind Control on an opponent's monster and use it to link summon in the next step.  Your first goal is to link summon Test Panther with two of your three monsters and have one G. Beast leftover on the field.  So, if one of your three monsters isn't a Gladiator Beast, make sure you use it in the link summon.  Once you link summon Test Panther, you can add G.B. United to your hand from the deck.  When using the other ability of Test Panther, swap out the Gladiator Beast on the field with Test Pather, with Attorix from your deck and use its ability to send an Augustus to the GY from your deck.  By doing this, Attorix is considered Augustus in both name and level for the rest of the turn.  If you have G.B. Comeback, use it to special summon the Augustus in the GY to the field (This step can, if possible, can be done anytime before the battle phase).  Then special summon Andabata with G.B. United.  For the three monsters you use, if you can special summon Augustus from the GY with G.B. Comeback, use the Attorix that had it's named changed when you sent Augustus to the GY as a substitute for Augustus, and leave Augustus on the field.  And then use two other monsters, besides Augustus, from your GY, field, and/or hand, preferably the GY.  If you can't special summon Augustus from the GY, leave Attorix on the field when special summoning Andabata.  Do not use both the Attorix on the field and Augustus, if possible, when using the G.B. United.  Andabata can special summon Gyzarus who can then destroy 2 cards on the field.  Destroy all your opponents monsters with this ability if you can.  Next, use Andabata and Gyzarus to contact fuse and summon Tamer Editor.  Tamer Editor can then special summon another fusion Gladiator Beast, so pick either Heraklinos or Domitianus.  If there aren't any monsters on your opponent's field by this point, Heraklinos is preferable to destroy any possible spells/traps, and if you can get Augustus on the field, you'll have exactly 8000 attack points between Augustus, Tamer Editor, and Heraklinos.  Keep in mind, because of G.B. United, Test Panther can't attack the turn you use it.  (If you have Instant Fusion in your hand when you summon Tamer Editor, you can have Tamer Editor special summon Gyzarus instead, destroy two more of your opponent's cards, and then you can use Instant Fusion to special summon Essedarii.  Gyzarus and Essedarii can contact fusion into your second Tamer Editor and use it to special summon a Heraklinos or Domitianus.  A great alternate if you don't have Comeback.)  If everything goes right you'll have 8000+ attack points between all your monsters by the time you enter your battle phase, and hopefully no monsters on your opponent's field, so you can OTK.  And if that's not possible, you have many options to hold your own.  There are other slightly altered ways to do it besides what was just stated.  For example, if you get 1 Augustus in your hand at the start, instead of Attorix, you can use Test Panther to special summon the Augustus in your deck, who can then special summon the Augustus in your hand to the field.  I would only do this if you don't have G.B. Comeback, because if you go the Heraklinos route, you'll want to have as many cards in your hand as you can spare.  If you get the optimal hand, and there are more than a few different combinations to accomplish it in this deck's setup, you can OTK your opponent if you go second.  And between the main and extra deck, the only card in this deck that is selling for more than $4 is Evenly Matched, which many could do without.  This deck isn't very expensive considering how effective it is."

By using break swords effect to destroy its self and origins SS effect you can go into 2 xyz monsters off the 2 effects and possibly go into the 2 utopic monsters if you choose to run them or go for a full lock down with Ophion and Redoer or Utopia. To do this you will need to special summon kerykeion off of Origins effect and then use kerykeions 2 effects to add one of the monsters used to link summon Origin (which will be both evilswarm) then normal summon it to your field, the 2 monsters brought back by break sword will both be level 4 so by doing this you can go into 2 xyz off of this combo."

Going first and going full combo will end on board with Borreload Savage Dragon at 4200ATK with 3 negates, a Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres which will act as a disruption and tribute into Amorphage Goliath which will lock your opponent out of the Extra Deck(and yourself but stopping your opponent from doing anything is the strategy). Going second you can easily link climb into a Borrelsword Dragon and a Borreload Savage Dragon for a quick OTK. The deck doesnt use too many resources so even if you go full combo first you still have most your extra deck and main deck."

Might have regional potential with the right format and pilot.,"The main point of this deck is to control your opponent by linking of their important materials and popping their cards before they are able to capitalize on them. The deck takes practice and requires you learn the balance of popping your own cards versus popping your opponent's cards. There are a lot of times where you intentionally die by battle just to proc effects and extend plays. This deck also has a lot of battle phase shenanigans with Rakea, Abominable, and Escape of the Unchained.  A few explanations:  Interrupted Kaiju Slumber: Dark Hole that gives both players Kaijus. Notably this allows you to use Unchained Soul of Disaster to link with the Kaiju given to your opponent. 4 Kaijus is a good ratio I believe. You can certainly run more, but I don't think the field spell is a great inclusion because it isn't searchable and doesn't always give you the value you would like. Opening Kaiju Slumber, any twin, and the field spell however can end on Soul of Rage backed by multiple negates, so if you can find a consistent way to do so, run wild with it.  Dark Spirit of Banishment/Malice: Self-recurring handtraps that summon your level 8 unchaineds out of grave, with Banishment also redirecting an attack in the process. Note that they negate the effect of the summoned monster so you can't then use Abominable to pop or Disaster to link off opponent's monsters, but if Disaster is destroyed his grave effect will still fire.  Witch's strike: Popping backrow against Unchained is just a bad idea. I'm doing that myself half the time anyway. This is a very nice power trap that blows out the opponent. Helps a lot in the Guru matchup. This can be replaced with any 3 cards of your choice.  The extra deck: You pretty much just need the Unchained links, the other stuff is really just utility. Unicorn is nice because you can make it on the opponent's turn to get that additional shuffle. BLS link is pretty easy to make with a level 7 or higher. Dingirsu allows you to handle things you can't normally. Borrelsword exists for the sole purpose of outing Ultimate Falcon, you typically don't OTK or when you are in a position where you could you're probably locked into summoning Fiends. Masterking is really only made when you have a Dark Spirit summoned off of Tour Guide you need to put in grave. There is so much flex space in this extra deck. Everything in here has come up once or twice at least, but there's probably better situational links/rank 8s."

With strong resource management and cards that offer heavy disruption and utility on your opponent's turn, Eldlich is definitely going to be a strong rogue-option moving forward in the yugioh meta. Though the TCG lacks a few of the cards that make the stun build of Eldlich more deadly, adding handtraps is always a solid way to make sure your opponent can't really play the game. Eldlich The Golden Lord makes going second or recovering from previous turns more bearable by offering additional removal and pushing for game."

I played Shaddoll HERO Traptrix Cyber Dragon, a kind of 4-way meta mash. I played it because HEROdolls were not hit since last cup and they were clearly best deck and I did pretty well last cup for my standards. Additionally Traptrix added another engine that wouldn't allow me to run out of gas. The general idea was to add a goal for all the HEROdoll advantage, and Traptrix gave them interruption, if my opponent didn't play into the Traptrix stuff, then I could play HEROdolls with extra backrow. Cydra were just a light engine to send off of Shaddoll Fusion for Construct since I heard not abusing Construct was playing the deck wrong but it was mostly useless.  What tech choices did you play?  I mostly picked my tech choices from an article/decklist Mika made on the most impactful side-deck and tech cards for this format, most of the spice is on the side deck, different Trap Holes for different decks. I guess running 3 Myrmelio is kind of a tech, mostly because I didn't want to run the other bad Traptrix.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  I didn't prepare for the meta more than reading the article mentioned above and implementing Traptrix as another way to never lose momentum. I don't think any of the big components of this deck will survive the next banlist, but in retrospect, 1 of the Myrmelio I was running could have been another Shadow Mist so I could play with the HERO part of the deck more often.  How were your matchups?  First game was against an illegal decklist. Second game was Mekk HERO which was really strong. Third game was pure-ish Traptrix, match was fun but since I was playing Traptrix too, I managed to steal Myrmelio and make Sera, game was always in my hand tho. Forth game was Spyral HERO and I got completely and utterly destroyed, Sleeper destroys this deck single handedly, beats over Wynda, pops Construct/Sunriser, immune to Absolute Zero and nobody would summon it to a Sera board. 5th game was against Traptrix Synchro and it was a tug of war, really fun but again was never in a losing position due to my advantage.  In the top 8 I rematched Mekk HERO and got a win via a topdeck war, which this deck seems to be adept at, then I played vs Gem-Knight which were sadly demolished by convinient hand traps, and lastly was defeated by Spyral in a way more interactive duel than I was expecting.  Most of these games I was safety netted by my deck just being strong and my luck being incredibly generous, except for the Spyral games."

I decided to play dinos, because I’d always really enjoyed them and the last time I was going to play them, I changed decks at the last second. That’s about it  What tech choices did you play?  For tech choices, I was running Sales Pitch in the maindeck and Big Burn in the sideboard, along with the classic Pacifis cards. Sales Pitch is an amazing card, just due to the fact that its capable of searching any card in your deck. Combine that with the fact that most decks that were being played searched multiple times each duel, and the card has a good-fair chance of being live when drawn. Big Burn is my special anti-GY card. When it resolves, every monster in the GY is banished. Due to the fact that I’m playing dinos, I’m carrying a couple ways of recovering/playing around that (Giant Rex and Overtex Qoatlus), while a deck like Dark Spirit Unchained will become severely crippled upon resolution. Pacifis was included simply because Kabazauls and MegalosmasherX are the best cards in the deck, so why would I not want to play around them?  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  Due to the meta being rather GY oriented and floaty (floating on destruction/sending), I ran a number of cards in the Main Deck and Sideboard geared to counteract that (D.D. Crow, Called by the Grave, Big Burn, Jelly Cannon, Karma Cut, Paleozoic Dinomischus, Storming Mirror Force.) Was also maining Sales Pitch due to the level of searching that I expected to be occurring. Lastly, due to how Extra Deck focused most of the decks appeared to be, I was siding Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag in order to steal their monsters from the Extra Monster Zone and use them against my opponent.  How were your matchups?  Most of the matchups were fine. The only difficult matchups I had were vs Chaos HERO Dolls and Dark Spirit Unchained. Both decks have incredible recover and are capable of going extremely positive in card advantage, so it’s rather difficult for Dinos to deal with them without niche options.  How would you change the deck going forwards?  In the future, I’m looking forward to ETCO introducing Jewel Beast – Argosaurus which is an incredible card for dinos, due to it being able to search Double Evolution Pill, D.D. Crow and Masked Chameleon. I would aim to shift the deck from 60-card pacifis to lower decksize with more combos and easier access to specific cards."

Hero and Shaddoll are both very strong fusion decks at the moment with good consistentcy to search out fusion spells and the ability to easily trigger graveyard effects in both archetypes. Chaos Dragons are a powerful reward for using fusion plays to place cards in the GY and send cards like eclipse wyvern and brotaur to search big rewarding monsters. Neos fusion serves as an additional way to get to important play starters.  What tech choices did you play?  Added more light monsters since just a light with a fusion spell and shaddoll monster can enable access to the loop of recurring construct and other shaddoll fusions with the revival trap. For this reason I added seyfert and extra neos, though they were pretty unexceptional outside of fusion material. I tried to main as many consistency cards as possible knowing that targeted negations and handtraps would probably only come in from my opponent past game 1. After game 1 I can rely less on consistency and more on side cards. Hero lives was pretty questionable though and I didn't feel great about it.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  The main deck out values most decks, In subsequent games I tried to gain an advantage by siding handtraps that dealt with the vyon combo turn 1 and removal for traptrix, also some gy hate for spirits. That's pretty much it.  How were your matchups?  My side behaved extremely well this month. Mainly I only lost to sleeper and disruption. Ariel is extremely good vs spirits. Otherwise I just pretty much had the proper removal to deal with threats until top 8. I need more interaction I think, because I was always scared of aggro."

SPYRAL HERO DM. I played it because it was the last list I sent to Pandor from the previous tournament I played (a locals) and I didn't have the time to build a deck for the Cup. Oddly, I lost both matches I played on that locals with this deck, while I finished undefeated the YTC.  What tech choices did you play?  I decided to play Apprentice Illusion Magician and Dark Magician as my secondary Soul targets. I also played Magicalized Fusion with the intention of using DM and any Spellcaster from GY to make The Dark Magicians, but the idea did't work and I ended up siding out the card every match (I made TDM a few times with Polymerization, tho). I also played SPYRAL MISSION - Recapture because I think it's actually good, since it both protects the Sleeper Summon from some common backrow cards like Torrential Tribite or Bottomless Trap Hole and the effect to take control of a monster is not that rare with all the revival I was playing.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  I'll 100% cut Magicalized for Oasis of Dragon Souls. I would also cut Apprentice since 2 Soul targets are enough. Also, with current proposed hits in mind, I would remove either Sleeper or Sleeper+Last Resort and Sunrise+Miracle Fusion, while going for 55 cards to keep Liquid Soldier.  How were your matchups?  Round 1 I played against Labcoat's Unchained Traptrix. It was very difficult because the Unchained big guy has non-targeting destruction, to the point I thought I was going to lose, but I managed to win since Sleeper is that strong. Round 2 was against Jmax's Machines. Sleeper did most of the work here. Round 3 vs WTrain's Unchained Shaddoll HERO. Opened really good both games. Won G1 thanks to Sleeper and G2 thanks to Fully Armed banishing both Construct and Winda. Round 4 my opponent was Tactic Lu. They oppened badly both games. Round 5 vs GuiltyGearxx's Chaos HERO Shaddoll. G1 I open badly and he opens really good so I lose. G2 I win thanks to Fully armed banishing Winda. G3 I summon Sleeper on my 1st turn and enters unninterrupted. Top 8 was vs Spiderking on Synchro Traptrix. G1 I went for a T1 Sleeper that got BTH'd, but since I was ahead on resources and I had enough responses I managed to summon Sleeper a second time. G2 he opened badly and I opened Vyon. Top 4 was vs Wtrain again. G1 I lose since he has more responses than I had starters. G2 I manage to outresource him. G3 it's literally Super Agent Beatdown, since he bricked and I summoned both Super Agent and Tough to use their effects and attacked. Finals was vs Tactic Lu. G1 I summoned Sleeper but got outed, and in the end my opponent attacking with Sera into Tough (It was set to avoid the trap Holes) and equipping Fully armed to him won me the game. G2 I could play through the interruptions my opponent had and I negated his Vyon. In the end I won by attacking into a timelord and activating Forbidden Chalice on it for Exact lethal damage."
