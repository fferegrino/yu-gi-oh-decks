This enables access borreload dragon or Skulldeat the chained dracoserpent.</li>  	<li>The drop in of number 47. First of all because it is able to be summoned by bahumut and able to attach xyz materials. Second of all, mermail abssdine grants access to number 47. Third of all, number 47 and Abyssmegalo could bite huge chunk of blood off the opponent without monsters standing in between.</li>  	<li>Mermail Abyssmander and Abyssturge grants more access to the bahumut shark, at the same time Abyssmander grants access to the True King of All Calamities.</li>  	<li>Elemental lord is added in because it could be easily searched by Atlantean Dragoons.</li>  	<li>the sea turtle kaiju added for destruction of the board</li>  	<li>Surface added for consistency into later games.</li>  	<li>Typical deep sea diva synchro pathway kept.</li>  	<li>Mask change 2 and Masked Hero Acid could be added against opponents like paleozoic frogs</li>  	<li>Abyss-Squall could be added for consistency and late game.</li> </ol> Play this deck, enjoy, and give suggestions in the comments section below.  &nbsp;"

Their FLIP effects disrupt your opponent, gather or recover cards, and help swarm, and if your opponent decides to negate one, they'll probably do so with a card that also destroys, triggering their powerful effects to swarm further directly from the deck. As you build up resources, you can spend them on their Link Monsters, which turn these innocent insects into powerful attackers with stacking buff effects, and if your opponent does deal with them, you get the resources you spent to make them back.  Some specific techs of note in detail: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Block Spider"">Block Spider</a> can be Special Summoned by the effect of <a data-name=""World Legacy in Shadow"">World Legacy in Shadow</a>, triggering its effect for a cheap Link or an attack lock.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, besides just being general Link assistance, is usfeul for a specific combo: use one <a data-name=""Sheep Token"">Sheep Token</a> to create <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> in the Extra Monster Zone, then two more tokens for <a data-name=""X-Krawler Synaphysis"">X-Krawler Synaphysis</a> beneath it, then the Spider and your last token for a second Synaphysis next to it. Their effects affect each other, and the Extra Monster Zone is free to put something else with down-facing arrows in there.</li>  	<li>It's worth noting that besides other Krawlers, <a data-name=""Verdant Sanctuary"">Verdant Sanctuary</a> can also search <a data-name=""Maxx"">Maxx ""C""</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a> may seem out of place, but with how slow-paced the deck is, Link Monsters remaining in ATK position, and a lot of action happening on your opponent's turn, it hinders you little enough to be worth using it against a Special Summon heavy opponent.</li> </ul> As Side Decks are largely dependent on what you expect to face, I've opted to use it to illustrate other options instead. Besides extra Krawlers for tweaking ratios to taste, and Book of Eclipse - which can blow out certain match-ups but is near-worthless against Link-heavy decks - it contains some spicy techs. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Karakuri Strategist mdl 248"">Karakuri Strategist mdl 248 ""Nishipachi""</a> is a Level 3 Tuner that can get you to <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> with only 1 Krawler non-Tuner, as well as flipping a face-down Krawler to apply its effect. However, the deck can't afford any more Normal Summons.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Junk Synchron"">Junk Synchron</a> can revive a Krawler to make <a data-name=""Junk Warrior"">Junk Warrior</a>, which can gain ATK from any Krawlers you control. This is nothing more than a meme.</li>  	<li>Speaking of memes, <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> can theoretically be summoned with 3-4 Krawlers and any of the deck's odd-leveled Tuners.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Inzektor Picofarena"">Inzektor Picofarena</a> can help recover resources, as well as an interesting interaction with the Krawlers' floating - it works from the Spell/Trap zone. In addition, you can play actual Inzektors for their effects, and they can be summoned from the deck by tributing a Krawler with <a data-name=""Insect Imitation"">Insect Imitation</a>.</li> </ul>"

You can also use brilliant fusion to allow you to link summon Pahntom Core allowing you to special summon more monsters augmenting Lapis Lazuli's effect. There are many other combos that you can do but I find that it is easier to learn them yourself and maybe even make modifications.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

The most interesting thing i implemented in the deck is that kaiju and jurrac dino give access to star eater, and tyranno and aeolo does the same thing. kaiju and aeolo could also gain access to Chaofeng, Legend of the Yang Zing which could replace dragon of the ice barrier. Although we have to agree that dragon of the ice barrier is strong but the fact that it needs 3 or more monsters to summon makes it hard bring out on to the field. true kings and aeolo give access to Leo the gate keeper.  For more resistance, drop a few PSY or ash blossoms and ghost orge into the deck, replace the kaijus with them. Yazi yang zing and mare mare could be added into the deck.  The down side of this combo is that mare mare is a water wyrm monster and could not be summoned by Bahrastos (but it helps with the summoning of Bahratos).  true draco phoenix Marriamne and black ptera could also be added into the deck, but i suggest not because it is hard to summon. Although tornado dragon and Castel was added help with it, but again, it works better with Yangzing dino because there is Pulao, wind of the Yang Zing.Although deng long was a body blow to yang zing dino, it is still playable. If you want look at a true king yang zing dino deck, go check out snavar98's deck. Elemental Lord Pyrorex could also be dropped in, but i suggest against it since it could not be summoned by the pill and has a very limited summoning condition. Tyranno infinity could dropped in to cover some attack weaknesses.  the effect of lost world and its uses go find in the article, they do a better job of explaining it.  The above are my suggestions for true king dino arch type, hope you find it helpful.  Changes to the deck: <ol>  	<li>Chaofeng, Legend of the Yang Zing has been added of its easy summon condition and that the fact it grants easier passway to sychro. There is also the fact it could possibly summon mare mare or the other true kings.</li>  	<li>Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing and mare mare has been added. I have realised, after reminders of others, that Yazi itself fits in a more aggro play style, whereas the ancient fairy dragon that have been replaced fits with a combo play style. Whereas ancient fairy dragon could be useful, i believe that Yazi itself is a much more useful monster in terms of its effect and the fact that it could bring mare mare to the board, opening more room for synchro.</li>  	<li>The seven sins has been added as i realised one of the weaknesses of the deck. Sometimes when we have the ultimate conductor and the True King of All Calamities on the board there is simply not enough resistance. Also the two monster have a very similar effect in terms of controlling the opponent's monsters. There are specific situations where Number 77 would prove as much better choice.</li>  	<li>I have come to realise that there is no possible way to summon overtex coatls because the pill does not work on him and the fact that there could be no possible 5 banished dinosaurs. however, Overtex Coatls could be considered being put into the deck along with Soul Release and Tyranno Infinity.</li>  	<li>Soul Charge was added into the deck. Although true king dino has an incredible ability of building up a strong board, its power to build up a new board after the old one was destroyed proved weak. So therefore soul could very much help you in mid or late game.</li>  	<li>One of the two  Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju has been taken away because of adding of mare mare.</li> </ol> Update for V0.3 link format update (as i have recently just studied link format) <ol>  	<li>Crystron Needlefiber is added for new path to synchro, Celestial Double Star Shaman is added for Crystron's effect, as there are probably a few Babycerasauras and Petiteranodon in your hand or graveyard. Number 77 is removed to make room for the link monsters. Also, as Crystron is water, it also applies to Bahrastos' effect</li>  	<li>Chaofeng has been removed as i realised we could come with few situations of being able summon the monster. Whereas PSY Framelord, can be easily summoned by Celestial or Jurrac Dino +Hi-Speedroid Chanbara.</li>  	<li>Castel has been removed as it is one of the least frequent played monster while encountering different situations.</li>  	<li>Firewall Dragon has been added because of its easy to summon conditions and its second effect.</li> </ol> Please give more suggestions on improving the deck.  &nbsp;"
