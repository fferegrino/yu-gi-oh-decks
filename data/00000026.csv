Since they send from deck to graveyard, that helps, thin out your deck, and gets more banish material for Double Pill for UTC or Overtex.

As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• Standard Metalfoes ratios (x3 <a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a>, <a data-name=""Goldriver"">Goldriver</a>, <a data-name=""Silverd"">Silverd</a>, <a data-name=""Steelen"">Steelen</a>, <a data-name=""Melcaster"">Melcaster</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Bismugear"">Bismugear</a>)</strong> - <span>Your core cards. Self explanatory. Can't play a Metalfoes deck without Metalfoes monsters. They all do the same stuff, the only difference is their Levels.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Baobaboon"">Baobaboon</a></strong> - <span>Free mulligan/hand fix, also free Metalfoes targets and a free Rank 3 on board. Works well with Cross-Sheep.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Red Rose Dragon is your 1 card <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a>. Roxrose Dragon is your searcher for the Red Rose and also its target.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Summoner's Art"">Summoner's Art</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a> searcher. That's it lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Igknight Reload"">Igknight Reload</a></strong> - <span>pretty much an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> and a <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a>, but better.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Counter"">Metalfoes Counter</a></strong> - <span>We can afford to play x3 of these because expect N/R only format to be slower compared to standard and we need as many search/consistency cards as we can get.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a></strong> - <span>Mithrilium being just a Rare is the reason why this deck is even playable, honestly. Orichalc is one of your offensive beat sticks.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></strong> - <span>If your Pendulum deck can afford to make Rank 7 monsters, then you have no reason not to play this neat free negate package. Meteorburst shuts down any damage step shenanigans or monster effects during the Battle Phase.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Scrap Archfiend"">Scrap Archfiend</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a></strong> - <span>Nirvana High Paladin is more of a win more card, but still a strong boss monster and helps you OTK faster. Scrap Archfiend could be any Level 7 Synchro monster you want, it's just a bridge to Nirvana High Paladin.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 74: Master of Blades"">Number 74: Master of Blades</a></strong> - <span>A neat form of interruption/negation, especially in a format where <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> will definitely be a staple.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>A 2600 DEF body on board that has an interruption in the form of a replacement effect in response to an opponent's monster effect, your go-to monster from <a data-name=""Baobaboon"">Baobaboon</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Amalgam"">Heavymetalfoes Amalgam</a></strong> - <span>I'm actually considering bumping it up to 2, just because of the fact that it can destroy cards you control and it can either summon itself back or equip itself to a ""Metalfoes"" monster you control and boosting it up with 1000 ATK. It's not <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, but it's not as bad as most people think.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a></strong> - <span>Your two main ways of dumping <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> to cheat out <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a>. Cross-Sheep is a must have in any Fusion based deck that can swarm and Link Summon, and Gravity Controller is also a neat card, especially against monsters in the Extra Monster Zone that is hard to out.</span></span>  <span>Additional notes:</span>  <span>Also, honorable mentions in which I forgot to include are <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Magical Abductor"">Magical Abductor</a>, <a data-name=""Metalfoes Adamante"">Metalfoes Adamante</a>, <a data-name=""Firewall eXceed Dragon"">Firewall eXceed Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a>, <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Powercode Talker"">Powercode Talker</a>. Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is a great omni-negate especially if you're playing the archetypal field spell <a data-name=""Metamorformation"">Metamorformation</a>. Adamante is just an additional 2500 body non-effect monster that would be great in case you plan on playing their field spell, that means he gets the benefit of its protection. Firewall eXceed Dragon works well with either <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> or <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, if you ever decide to play both of them, bumping it up to 4000 ATK potentially, but if you plan to do so, I highly suggest also playing <a data-name=""Magical Abductor"">Magical Abductor</a> as a bonus searcher, Pendulum Scale, and mainly an additional Level 4. Defender of the Labyrinth is our best Link 2 monster for this format, considering the fact that we don't have many relevant Link 2s with both downward left and downward right arrows for the purposes of Pendulum Summoning, apart from Cross-Sheep. Gem-Knight Pearl is also a great addition especially if you're playing Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Powercode Talker is another good alternative win condition since it's not only a good beater, but his effect to tribute a monster it points to also triggers both <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> and <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a>'s effect to replace itself or pop a card on the field, respectively.</span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>There's a lot of ways to build this deck. You could splash in x3 <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Delta"">Psy-Framegear Delta</a> (for Spell negation), x2 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Zeta"">Psy-Framelord Zeta</a> (for interruption and recycling), and a <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> as an easy way to either interrupt your opponent's Spells or make a Level 8 Synchro during your turn. You could also use <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a> to search <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> as a Normal Summon. You can splash in low rarity Kaijus as well for Mithrilium to bounce. If you're feeling spicy, mix it with some Yosenjus. Make it a staple city and it'll also probably work itself out. There's a lot of room for options when it comes to Pendulums, especially Metalfoes, and that's why I love it. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

The card allows for otherwise dead hands in prior builds to flourish and gives the deck a greater  degree of consistency, an expanded level of versatility, and allows for the creation of stronger first turn boards. I've chosen to utilize Dragoon over Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer given the Dragoon's ability to negate, the fact that it can facilitate the swift depletion of your opponent's field and/or LP, and the fact that Dragon Buster already has a quickplay banishing effect. The only problem I see is that both Dragoon and Dragon Buster require you to discard to activate their best effects. While my previous ABCDragoon builds utilized Mystic Mine over Pseudo Space, I've decided to go back to using the latter as it further bolsters consistency given a simple combination of Union Hanger and Pseudo Space allows you to build a suitable board with Buster alongside I:P or a Dragoon summoned by the Verte. The fact that both Dragon Buster and Dragoon rely on discards, something I saw as a weakness in the past, also means that it's beneficial that you can further increase your card advantage by engaging in shenanigans via playing Pseudo Space after already having activated and utilized Union Hanger's effects.  I'm still running a decent line-up of handtraps so as to increase one's ability to stand firm should one's opponent be going first. I'll always have a soft spot for the PSY-Framegear Gamma engine and am still running a copy of PSY-Framelord Omega given how devastating it can be for your opponent if you summon that card after negating a handtrap used against you on your own turn before you've summoned a monster.  I've been thinking over the extra deck but believe Borrelsword is a worthy addition considering how easy it is to summon when utilizing materials left behind by Epigonen's effect. It's allowed me to win on the second turn of a game in a situation where I would have otherwise bricked if I wasn't running Epigonen. Accesscode and the Knightmare package will always be stables in any Link-focused ABC deck, though, considering how easy it is to link climb into Accesscode, itself. Epigonen actually makes such a climb even easier.  Part of me is still considering the benefits of Lambda given how Nibiru can still be a problem should your opponent refuse to wait for Dragoon's summon, perhaps anticipating Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer or some sort of Brandish monster instead, without an Unauthorized Reactivation in hand to protect Dragon Buster. You can still summon a strong Appolousa on your first turn through Epigonen shenanigans if you know your opponent has Nibiru in their main deck or side deck.  I'm still tinkering with my own side deck, though, but I'm not so deluded as to think this deck is the best an ABC deck. that utilizes Epigonen, can offer. There's always room for improvement especially in a game like Yu-Gi-Oh! where the meta constantly evolves.  &nbsp;"

I'm torn as to whether I should keep Lamba in spite of that. Reintroducing Link Spider or Lyna the Light Charmer might not be a bad idea in Lambda's place. 'm also torn between Pseudo Space and Mystic Mine as I've been in  other recently posted ABC builds.

Not only is Electrumite legal but we also have access to Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom, so if you want to go for a pesky FTK then its fully possible.  With the exception of 2 Astrograph, 2 Chronograph, 2 Double Iris, a Darkwurm and a Harmonizing all of the cards which made Pendulum Magicians Tier one back in 2017-2018 is here, only one Double Iris hurts and the more Sorcerers legal the better but compared to the TCG this deck is far stronger.  The main aim of this deck is to get out Electrumite pre-Pend summon and win from there. Selene lets us play around Nibiru and aside from Droll, most common handtraps are nothing but a annoyance, sometimes Nibiru against a bad hand could end it or gamma on the Electrumite but as soon as Electrumite resolves we're most likely winning and thanks to the FTK potential you can even just ignore Maxx ""C"" unless your opponent draws into another handtrap or more so is best to ash/call it anyway.  This build is more geared towards going first for the FTK but if you want to cut the FTK package then maybe consider adding in a few boardbreakers like Evenly or DRNM.  One thought i had in i think a single Dragonpit Magician in here somewhere to out Skill Drain Exactly couldn't hurt but I'm not quite sure what to cut, possibly the Time Pendulumgraph since we only have one Double Iris and we aren't planning on going into the grindgame or even going past turn one if we can help it, although Time Pendulumgraph alsoouts Skill Drain so I'm 50/50 on that one"

After having played with various Gravekeeper's deck builds for months there is no doubt that the Field Spell  Necrovalley is the heart and soul of this archetype. Some Gravekeeper's deck builds focus specifically on trying to get Necrovalley up as soon as possible and trying to protect it at all costs. (In other words Necrovalley deck builds and not as much Gravekeeper's.) This Gravekeeper's pure deck build focuses on all that both Gravekeeper's AND Necrovalley have to offer.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck breakdown:  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Recruiter - ran at two because 3 is just too much. Gravekeeper's Recruiter is mainly used to extend into either Gravekeeper's Commandant to extend to Necrovalley OR if Necrovalley is already up on field (and depending on the situation) Gravekeeper's Recruiter can be used to extend to Gravekeeper's Spiritualist (if there are enough resources in hand or on field to then fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist) OR if there is a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist in graveyard Gravekeeper's Recruiter can be used to extend to Gravekeeper's Headman to then be summoned triggering Gravekeeper's Headman effect to then special summon Gravekeeper's Spiritualist from graveyard and then go into a fusion summon with Headman and Spiritualist to fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Nobleman - ran at 1 because having to rely on opponent having to attack is a drawback. Though it is ran at 1 this card may just be one of the biggest extenders in the deck. Usually Gravekeeper's Nobleman is used to help extend to any of the Gravekeeper's flip effect monsters. Depending on whether Necrovalley (field spell) is up or not really depends on what can be done with Gravekeeper's Nobleman. If Necrovalley is up on field then Nobleman's effect can be used to set a Gravekeeper's Spy to then be flipped and special summon a Gravekeeper's Shaman (Only if enough Gravekeeper's monsters are in grave to boost Shaman's defense) OR Gravekeeper's Spy can be used to special summon a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist setting up the field for a fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. If Necrovalley is not on the field then Gravekeeper's Nobleman can be used to extend into Gravekeeper's Recruiter to then get a Gravekeeper's Commandant to hand and then extend into Necrovalley OR depending on how many monsters are in the Battle Phase Gravekeeper's Nobleman can be used extend to Gravekeeper's Spy (Gravekeeper's Spy would be special summoned face-down because of Nobleman's effect) to then be flipped and further extend out to Gravekeeper's Recruiter and Recruiter then extending out to Gravekeeper's Commandant and Gravekeeper's Commandant extending out for a Necrovalley field spell. OR Greaveekeper's Nobleman can be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Guard to help bounce a monster off the field (Gravekeeper's Guard would be special summoned face-down due to Gravekeeper's Nobleman effect). Depending on how many Gravekeeper's monsters are in the graveyard Gravekeeper's Nobleman can also be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Shaman.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Headman - ran at 1 because of low stats YET a VERY strong extender that can help change a tied of the game. Gravekeeper's Headman's effect is triggered when either normal OR special summoned. Depending on the scenario and on whether Necrovalley field spell is up on the field Gravekeeper's Headman can be used in various ways. If Necrovalley is up Gravekeeper's Headman can be used to special summon a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to then fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist using both Headman and Spiritualist. OR Gravekeeper's Headman can be used to special summon any level 4 Gravekeeper's  monster from graveyard face-down. (Targets include Gravekeeper's Spy, Gravekeeper's Guard, Gravekeeper's Ambusher, Gravekeeper's Descendent, Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, Gravekeeper's Commandant, Gravekeeper's Heretic, Gravekeeper's Cannonholder, Gravekeeper's Assailant). If both Gravekeeper's Headman and Gravekeeper's Spiritualist are in the graveyard and a Gravekeeper's Chief is tribute summoned, Gravekeeper's Chief effect can be used to target Gravekeeper's Headman to special summon it then triggering Gravekeper's Headman effect to then special summon Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to then go into a Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Spy - Ran at 2. Gravekeeper's Spy helps set the board up depending on scenario.  Usually a Gravekeeper's Spy will be 2500 defense if Necrovalley field spell is on field OR if both Necrovalley Field Spell is on field and Necrovalley Temple is set this boosts Gravekeeper's Spy's even further (Necrovalley Temple reduces opponent's monsters ATK and DEF  by 500 as along as both a Necrovalley field spell is up on field and a Gravekeeper's monster is on field). This theoretically gives Gravekeeper's Spy a 1000 Defense boost meaning that even a monster with 3000 original attack would not be able to out Gravekeeper's Spy while in defense position.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Guard - Though a very strong card with the ability to bounce Gravekeeper's Guard is ran at 1 because it does not help further synergy the deck and board. Similar to Gravekeeper's Spy, Gravekeeper's Guard is difficult to out when both Necrovalley and Necrovalley Temple are up and active on field.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Cannonholder - VERY underrated card and ran at 1 because similar to Gravekeeper's Guard it does not help further synergy the deck. Is mainly used to inflict damage without having to attack. Mainly used to tribute Gravekeeper's Recruiter to both inflict 700 Damage with Gravekeeper's Cannonholder effect AND to trigger Gravekeeper's Recruiter searching effect. Depending on the duel  and opponent's life points sometimes a board/duel is locked and set up with various Gravekeeper's being in defense position. Gravekeeper's Cannonholder can be used to inflict deadly burn damage before OR after a Battle Phase.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Assailant - Run at 1 and mainly used to prevent opponent from gaining field advantage with monsters. Aside from Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, Gravekeeper's Assailant is a very offensive card that helps clear the board 1-by-1. Gravekeeper's Assailant effect to be able to change face-up monster's battle position also helps get rid of monsters that have high DEF yet low ATK.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Commandant - In other words Terraforming on legs. Can easily be ran at 3 though I run it at 2 and here's why. There are various ways to get to Gravekeeper's Commandant as mentioned above AND because Necrovalley Throne is being ran at 2. Necrovalley Throne not only acts as another normal summon for a Gravekeeper's monster BUT can be used as a primary way to extend out to Gravekeeper's Commandant. Gravekeeper's Commandant is mainly used to extend out for Necrovalley field spell. Can easily be aran at 3 to learn the in's and outs of main deck by swapping out a Necrovalley Throne.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Descendent - Ran at 1. Mainly used to get rid of Spells or Traps. Can also be used to trigger Gravekeeper's Recruiter effect.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Ambusher - Ran at 1 - Depending on whether Necrovalley is up on field and whether opponent has a card in graveyard that has of benefit by being graveyard, Gravekeeper's Ambusher flip effect can target a card in opponent's graveyard and return it to the bottom of their deck. Not only that but if Gravekeeper's Ambusher is successfully flipped and sent to graveyard after being flipped face up Gravekeeper's Ambusher can add 1 ""Necrovalley"" card from graveyard to hand. (being Necrovalley field spell, Necrovalley Temple, Necrovalley Throne, Hidden temples of Necrovalley or Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley)  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Heretic - Ran at 1. A beast in itself when Necrovalley is up on the field. Gravekeeper's Heretic is unaffected by all other card effects as long as Necrovalley is on the field meaning that ironically Gravekeeper's Heretic does not even get the ATK/DEF boost from Necrovalley. Gravekeeper's Heretic is powerful because not only is it unaffected by all other card effects BUT by having Gravekeeper's Heretic up on field many of the other Necrovalley Spell/Trap activation requirements are met.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Spiritualist - Ran at 2. Mainly used to fusion into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist through various routs as mentioned above. Depending on cards in hand the best targets to fusion summon with Gravekeeper's Spiritualist are the higher level Gravekeeper's monsters (Gravekeeper's Chief, Gravekeeper's Visionary and Gravekeeper's Oracle because of Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist effect). When Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist is fusion summoned Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist gains x100 ATK/DEF equal to the combined levels of the fusion materials used to fusion summon. (This on top of Necrovalley field spell's 500 ATK and DEF boost).  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Chief - Ran at 1.  Mainly only tribute summoned if other Gravekeeper's monsters are in graveyard to gain the most benefit out of Gravekeeper's Chief effect. Can be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Headman to then extend out to another Gravekeeper's monster AND/OR can be used to extend out to a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist in graveyard helping set up a board to fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Shaman - Ran at 1 though truly a Gravekeeper's tank alongside Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Helps protect Necrovalley from being destroyed, helps prevent opponent from activating a field spell card, gains 200 DEF for every Gravekeeper's monster in your graveyard AND negates all monster effects that activate in the graveyards except ""Gravekeeper's"" monster effects. Is usually only special summoned through Gravekeeper's Spy effect after having multiple Gravekeeper's monsters in your graveyard. Can be tribute summoned as last resort to protect both Necrovalley and life points and to prevent opponent from activating monster effects from their graveyard. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Visionary - Ran at 1. Gains 200 ATK for each Gravekeeper's monster in your graveyard. Usually only tribute summoned after a couple of Gravekeeper's monster are in your graveyard. Can be protected from being destroyed by discarding 1 Gravekeeper's monster from hand which helps prevent it from being destroyed and helps boost ATK by 200. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Oracle - Ran at 1. Usually only tribute summoned to reduce all opponent's monsters ATK and DEF by 2000 though can be used in many various ways with its other effects. Only requires 1 Gravekeeper's monster for it to be tribute summoned though can use 2 or 3 Gravekeeper's monsters for tribute to resolve more of Gravekeeper's Oracle effects. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Raigeki - Generic monster removal  &nbsp;  Royal Tribute - Ran at 1 though VERY powerful card if it resolves early in the duel. Can easily be ran at 2 by taking Field Barrier out.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Stele - Ran at 2. Very powerful in that it can bring back resources that are needed in hand such as Gravekeeper's Commandant to search Necrovalley OR if Necrovalley is already active Gravekeeper's Stele can help bring back Gravekeeper's Spiritualist with another Gravekeeper's monster to then fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Can also bring back to hand Gravekeeper's Recruiter to help search Gravekeeper's Commandant after Recruiter has been set or summoned and sent off field into graveyard.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley - Ran at 3. The heart and soul of a Gravekeeper's deck.  &nbsp;  Field Barrier - Ran at 1. Used to protect Necrovalley.  &nbsp;  Hidden Temples of Necrovalley - Ran at 1. Very powerful if its activation is patiently timed. Usually only activated after a board lock has been slightly established OR if Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist is on field alongside another face up Gravekeeper's monster. Can only be activated and stay up on field if both a Gravekeeper's monster and Necrovalley are face up on field. As long as Hidden Temples of Necrovalley stays up on field neither player can special summon monsters except ""Gravekeeper's"" monsters.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley Throne - Ran at 2. Can help normal summon 1 gravekeeper's monster in addition to the turn's normal summon OR can help search a ""Gravekeeper's"" monster from deck and then add to hand. Another extender to Gravekeeper's Commandant and is ran at 2 because Gravekeeper's Commandant is ran at 2. Can also help set up a board for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist depending if Necrovalley is up on field.  &nbsp;  Reload - Ran at 1. VERY underrated card. Helps free up an ""brick"" hand and can refresh a hand if different cards are needed. Can be ran at 2.  &nbsp;  Twin Twisters - Spell/Trap removal that is being ran to benefit Gravekeeper's Stele, Rite of Spirit and Gravekeeper's Headman.  &nbsp;  Rite of Spirit - Ran at 2. VERY useful in helping bring back ANY Gravekeeper's monster from your graveyard and is unaffected by Necrovalley. Very useful in bringing back a Gravekeeper's Recruiter or can also be used to bring back a Gravekeeper's Headman triggering Headman's effect to further extend and bring back another Gravekeeper's monster from Graveyard.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley Temple - Ran at 2. VERY underrated Gravekeeper's/Necrovalley card. As long as Necrovalley and a Gravekeeper's monster are up on the field Necrovalley Temple helps reduce opponent's monsters ATK and DEF by 500 in addition to Necrovalley already boosting Gravekeeper's monsters ATK and DEF by 500. Not only that but Necrovalley Temple plays a bigger role in a Graveekeper's/Necrovalley deck. During the Main Phase if there is no Field Spell on your field zone you can activate a Necrovalley from your hand or graveyard. (Meaning that if a Necrovalley was destroyed and sent to the graveyard during your OR your opponent's Main Phase, Necrovalley Temple effect activates which allows to to either activate 1 ""Necrovalley"" field spell from your hand OR re-activate the same Necrovalley that was just destroyed and sent to your graveyard). On top of all of this if Necrovalley Temple is destroyed on the field and sent to the graveyard (regardless of it being face-up or face-down/set) Necrovalley Temple allows you to set 1 ""Necrovalley"" Spell/Trap from your deck except for Necrovalley Temple onto your side of the field (Whether it be Necrovalley, Necrovalley Throne, Hidden Temples of Necrovalley, or Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley).  &nbsp;  Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley - Ran at 2. Pretty much this deck's Solemn Judgement. As long as both Necrovalley and  Gravekeeper's monster are up on the field Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley can negate a spell/trap of monster effect activation and destroy it. Usually only used when guaranteed that the card opponent is using is an attempt to out Necrovalley or an established field/board lock.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist - Ran at 3. The tank and main protector of Gravekeeper's and Necrovalley. Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist has VERY strong effects that synergies with the whole Gravekeeper's Necrovalley archetype. When fusion summoned gains x100 ATK/DEF equal to the combined levels of the fusion materials used to fusion summon. (This on top of Necrovalley field spell's 500 ATK and DEF boost). As long as Necrovalley and Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist remain up on field, neither Necrovalley nor Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist can be destroyed by card effects. During the Main Phase Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist effect can be activated allowing to search and add either 1 "" Gravekeeper's"" monster or 1 ""Necrovalley"" card from deck to hand during that same turn's End Phase. A must at three since it is the only Gravekeeper's extra deck monster currently available.  &nbsp;"

Pend","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with the actual Metalfoes list that I'm supposed to be posting first before the N/R only Metalfoes, so I don't know what else to say but Fusion and Pendulum best deck, presenting Metalfoes. As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span><strong>Why play this deck?</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite is legal, most importantly.</span></li>  	<li><span>Astrograph Sorcerer is also legal.</span></li>  	<li><span>No DPE, no problem. We still have Scythe lock access.</span></li>  	<li><span>It does not xeno lock you into anything, which means freedom for extra deck tech choices. (You'll be seeing me saying this a lot in this list.)</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Why not to play this deck?</strong></span>  <span>I honestly don't know any reason not to like playing this deck, aside from you having spite against Pendulums, I guess. But don't worry, it's a Pendulum deck that does not require much reading, if that's your main concern.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• Standard Metalfoes ratios (x3 <a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a>, <a data-name=""Goldriver"">Goldriver</a>, <a data-name=""Silverd"">Silverd</a>, <a data-name=""Steelen"">Steelen</a>, <a data-name=""Melcaster"">Melcaster</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Bismugear"">Bismugear</a>)</strong> - <span>Your core cards. Self explanatory. Can't play a Metalfoes deck without Metalfoes monsters. They all do the same stuff, the only difference is their Levels which can often be relevant.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a></strong> - <span>This is just a one card <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> or <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>. Your main normal summon.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> - <span>Pot of Greed, basically, that gets even better if you sent <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes Combination</a> for its draw effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Summoner's Art"">Summoner's Art</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a> searcher. That's it lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></strong> - <span>Also another access to <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. Tutors out 9 of your Metalfoes monsters from the deck for free.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes Combination</a></strong> - <span>Your main fodder for Magicians' Souls draw effect, because it provides you a search by doing so, and it's not once per turn.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic"">Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</a>, <a data-name=""Mythical Beast Jackal King"">Mythical Beast Jackal King</a>, <a data-name=""Reflection of Endymion"">Reflection of Endymion</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a></strong> - <span>The first three are your usual <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> targets to be sent to the GY. Mighty Master is also a great negate on board as well as Jackal King, if you ever plan to play more copies of <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a>, it's also fine. Reflection is also a good form of non-destruction removal, as well as a good Level 7 monster alongside Mighty Master for your Rank 7 plays if you need them. Astrograph Sorcerer is your primary target for <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, it's a guaranteed Rank 7 monster on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Parametalfoes Fusion"">Parametalfoes Fusion</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Fusion"">Fullmetalfoes Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Metalfoes Fusion is a Fusion Spell that is also an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, also a great discard for <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>. Parametalfoes Fusion is your most important Fusion Spell, you'll loop this with your <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a>. Fullmetalfoes Fusion is what you'll be using to bring out <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Alkahest"">Fullmetalfoes Alkahest</a> during your opponent's turn as an added form of interruption, most of the time.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Counter"">Metalfoes Counter</a></strong> - <span>We only play 1 because we have access to more powerful high rarity starters.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a></strong> - <span>Mithrilium is a great archetypal boss monster. Low rarity, has recycling effect, non-destruction removal, she also replaces herself, she's wonderful. Orichalc is a good support monster for the archetype, effectively turning your Metalfoes monsters into pseudo Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragons, he's also a removal upon getting rid of. You can bump either of them by 1 if you feel like doing so.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Alkahest"">Fullmetalfoes Alkahest</a></strong> - <span>This card is wonderful. As per usual, it's a non-destruction form of quick-play removal and interruption, that also enables you to use your opponent's monsters as Fusion Material, provided that they're equipped to her.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></strong> - <span>If your Pendulum deck can afford to make Rank 7 monsters, then you have no reason not to play this neat free negate package.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a></strong> - <span>The main reason as to why a lot of people hated Pendulums apart from the fact that they can swarm so fast, and the reason why the first thing that comes to people's minds is ""does this enable/break Electrumite?"" whenever a new Pendulum archetype/support gets released. I really wish the TCG gets her unbanned already, in order for the Pendulum decks to see more competitive play. She places any Pendulum monsters from your Deck to your Extra Deck face-up, she fixes your zones/scales and is also a draw in doing the latter.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Amalgam"">Heavymetalfoes Amalgam</a></strong> - <span>He can destroy cards you control and it can either summon itself back or equip itself to a ""Metalfoes"" monster you control and boosting it up with 1000 ATK. It's not <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, but it's not as bad as most people think.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a></strong> - <span>I cannot believe that this is legal in Master Duel. If you play in the TCG/OCG, you must already know about the ""Scythe Lock"", and if not, let me walk you through it. Artifact Scythe has an effect that if it's Special Summoned during your opponent's turn, your opponent cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck for the rest of that turn, and Artifact Dagda is a card that sets it from the deck, by simply triggering its effect by activating any of your cards' effect. We do not have access to <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (yet) in Master Duel, but the way people used to pop Scythe during your opponent's turn is by the effect of Tornado Dragon. If your deck can make a Rank 4, and it can easily bring out 2 monsters with different names, you got absolute ease of access to this package.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>This is purely out of personal preference, but it's always great to be able to have access to an alternate win condition. Other alternatives are Knightmare monsters or other Link 4 alternate win cons like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> - <span>It's a non-once per turn monster negate. You can also make her using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> during your opponent's turn, providing her with a protection against <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>What you'll usually be using to send <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> to the GY, since Absolute's effect to summon Vortex from the Extra Deck also triggers its effect to summon a Level 4 or lower monster from your GY. Useful when climbing to Selene or Apollousa.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  <span>This is not necessarily how you would side for this deck, rather than just a discussion for the other tech choices as I have stated before.</span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Qliphort Scout</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Qliphort Monolith"">Qliphort Monolith</a></strong> - <span>Gives you <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> access through <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>. A classic Metalfoes tech back in the day.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Crowley, the First Propheseer"">Crowley, the First Propheseer</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a></strong> - <span>Provides more draw power. If you wanna play more than 40 cards and more Endymion Pendulum monsters, feel free to use this as your Normal Summon instead.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a>, <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>The first two are just generic Rank 7 monsters, the former being a banishing extra deck and GY removal, and the latter being a non-destruction removal as well in the form of stealing your opponent's monsters, albeit both requiring targeting. Number 75 is always a neat negation for any deck that can bring out Rank 3s with ease.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>As I have stated before in my N/R rarity only Rose Metalfoes guide (here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/rose-metalfoes-master-duel-n-r-rarity-only/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/rose-metalfoes-master-duel-n-r-rarity-only/</a>), most Pendulum decks leave a lot of freedom when it comes to tech choices, and is seen by most people as just one big archetype instead of a summoning mechanic because of its toolbox-y nature. You could also play this deck with Pendulum Magicians and it'll probably work itself out just fine. This deck is one of the first Pendulum decks that I have learned to play and I'm glad that it's this one, because if I were to teach someone how to play Yu-Gi-Oh and have the need to introduce them to the Pendulum Summoning, this will definitely be one of if not my first choice, considering that it already contains a familiar mechanic in the form of Fusion Summoning in it, which is as I have stated multiple times already, my favorite summoning mechanic, and one that is not as taxing to learn compared to the others (with a few exceptions, of course). So that's that, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Before, both Squamata &amp; Hedgehog were at 3, but from testing I've noticed that it was a bit slow, so I cut them down to add more utility. At least we could still do the Shaddoll resource loop of Resh + Ariel/Falco + Hound. I'm actually considering playing 2 copies of both Falco and either Ariel or Hound for corner cases.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Magistus (x3 <a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Magistus Invocation"">Magistus Invocation</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Magistus Vritra"">Magistus Vritra</a>)</strong> - <span>This is one of our two ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"". I mean, it searches Invocation... Magistus Invocation. Hey, at least it's an Invocation that also uses monsters you control and not just monsters in your hand. Magistus Vritra is just a reborn spell. Before, this list also had Zoroa, but he serves no other purpose in testing but only as a beater.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Impostors (x3 <a data-name=""Beastking of the Swamps"">Beastking of the Swamps</a>, x2 <a data-name=""The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Goddess with the Third Eye"">Goddess with the Third Eye</a>, <a data-name=""Mystical Sheep #1"">Mystical Sheep #1</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Versago the Destroyer"">Versago the Destroyer</a>)</strong> - <span>Now this is the real cope version of Normal Summon ""Aleister"". At least we don't have to search for Invocation, because that's Rilliona's job, and because The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion acts as both the Fusion Material and the Fusion Spell. D/D Swirl Slime, before it was cool, and when it was slower. Also, I've cut it down to just 2, because it's only useful on established boards where you already have a Fusion monster. The other four is pretty much just here because they also act as names for the purposes of fusing for the Invoked monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Lunalight Black Sheep"">Lunalight Black Sheep</a></strong> - <span>This is as close as we can get to King of the Swamp, we need more access to Fusion Spells because our targets suck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>You need to see this as fast as you can.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Sinister Shadow Games"">Sinister Shadow Games</a>/<a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a></strong> - <span>Sinister Shadow Games is actually a better <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> for Shaddolls, at least. Paleozoic Dinomischus is a staple in every Trap Shaddoll build because it's a banishing removal and a WATER attribute for the purposes of our Fusion Summons. Before, this list also had Torrential Tribute, but this deck is too slow to recur back resources without Wendi. Trap selection is up for preference.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a></strong> - <span>The only Shaddoll targets that we have, aside from <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Wendigo"">Wendigo</a>, but we're not using her. Anoyatyllis stops every reborn effects OR just straight up kills Ritual Summoning, which I love because I hate Drytrons with a blazing passion of a thousand suns, and Wendigo is just a body on board that sits on defense position for us to stall out with or something.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Invoked (x2 <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Cocytus"">Invoked Cocytus</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>)</strong> - <span>The only Invoked targets that we have. <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> is pretty weak without <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, but it works best in tandem with Purgatrio, which can be equipped with <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a> if you want and just sit with it since it can attack all monsters your opponent controls anyway, mitigating your damage output but it works I suppose. Magellanica is literally just a big rock, so no. Augoeides and Cocytus are the two most worthwhile Invoked monsters to be summoned if I'm going to be honest, since Augoeides can both be good offensively and defensively depending on the board state, and Cocytus is just a cope Superheavy Samurai monster that is also a Towers. Sadly, <a data-name=""Power of the Guardians"">Power of the Guardians</a> is an SR, so the Purgatrio beatdown idea is not as strong.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit"">Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</a></strong> - <span>It's a 2800 DEF body <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a>, so long as the monster can be targeted.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Muddy Mudragon"">Muddy Mudragon</a></strong> - <span>One of our ""Aleister the Invoker"" copies. It's also a Fusion spell in itself.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker of Madness"">Aleister the Invoker of Madness</a></strong> - <span>He's here because he counts as ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"", and we need cards that can count as such for the purposes of Fusion Summoning our Invoked monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>Staple in every Fusion deck. More bodies on board = more Fusion/Link materials. Sadly it's not as relevant because we don't have much good targets for Link climbing.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Battlin' Boxer Veil"">Battlin' Boxer Veil</a></strong> - <span>The Duel Links special. It's a hand trap that nullifies damage, so long as it's not lethal. It's a FIRE attribute that's only relevant because of Invoked Purgatrio. That's... really all there is to it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Invoked Magellanica"">Invoked Magellanica</a> </strong>- <span>For the reasons stated before, alongside the x3 copies of <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Enlightenment Paladin"">Enlightenment Paladin</a>, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a></strong> - <span>The only relevant Synchro and Link monsters to climb to, in all honesty, at least in this event.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a></strong> - <span>Our cope version of <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>/<a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>. Also a SDSH special. (Although you could argue that this might be better compared to the latter two on certain occasions, but I'll leave that up for contention.)</span></span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>I do not know why for some reason, Konami made it so that all the DUEA archetypes have their most relevant cards all at SR or UR. I don't know if it's nostalgia bait or what, but it hurts for Shaddolls, not having access to either <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, or at least <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, or at least having one of the two relevant Fusion Spells between <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, or at least <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, in a low rarity event like this. Either way, I don't really expect this deck to perform as best as one might think, but it needs more testing, which you can't do in a ladder as cancerous as Master Duel's. Anyway, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Dinosaur real good?,"So the idea behind this one is simple, which is to be highly reliant on a mix of hand traps and trap cards backed by UTC, but with common Apollousa starts backed by the occasional Rank 4. The list emerged close to fully formed, this is a very ""feelsy"" Dinosaur deck rather than a meticulously crafted statistical engine. Some spicy tech is a pair of Token Collector, which combos really nicely with Lost World, but also provides a recurring way to kill Brave tokens and gut Auroradon's schtick.  No Kaiju, which is weird, but again, I have no explanation. This is literally a 40 card pile of cards I would want to run in Dinosaur, so I'm trying not to sully that.  Changed things up, mostly just down Extravagance and Solemn Strike and up Zefra Divine Strike, but also incorporating the Scrap package. The deck needs its extra deck more than the extra cards, but while space is tight I think it might be a good shell for Divine Strike, which IMO is actually kind of insane if you can make the extra deck space for it.  Kept the basic structure, but I'm above 40 cards now, to facilitate more babies, which was starting to come up. This does water down the Spell negates slightly, but seems to be working okay. It feels mostly like the same deck, except the combos can extend further sometimes.  Okay, so round 1 I ""felt"" it out, round 2 I bumped things up to see what I liked... Round 3 is when I did some maths, and made some hard cuts. So, I like this deck in this meta. Lancea is not that common, while it has some utility against Brave and DPE+Scythe, it isn't really as big a blowout, and Drytron isn't everywhere maining it. Scythe isn't free to play against, and I feel like there are some decks in this meta where that is basically true, but also the deck has a lot of plays it can make even if the Scythe goes off. NS Baby/Pill is hilarious against DPE+Scythe, provided you've answered the Brave Engine. Token Collector is already an insane combo piece in Dinos, but is also actually a hyper-relevant engine of a hand trap that reads ""FU"" vs Brave, and the deck has room for 15, count em, 15 interactive cards, with only a few minor sacrifices to get there. The basic idea is simple - decide whether to play around Nib or not, decide which Boss monsters to make, and then use them in tandem with interaction to narrow your opponent's lines of play down. Let's go through the card by card.  3 Lost World. So, back in the day, I thought this card was insane going second, but often unplayable going first. I've only sort of changed my mind about that - the protection from targeting alone is super clutch, there is no HOPT on the damn card, it combos off with a few cards just by itself, (including Token Collector+Dino). The card basically has 2 modes - going first it is either a complete waste of cardboard, or it just took over the game, THEN it is completely bonkers going second. Run this card. TBH I'd love to run a Terraforming, I think mathematically the 4 allowed copies works pretty well, but given the ratios of the deck at that point, and the ratios I wanted to run in the interactive suite, and the fact that too many Lost World can be bricky, it seemed like the 1 card to cut to keep everything where it needed to be. 41 cards actually fs things up a lot for where this version was going. This + Scrap Raptor is full combo, this + Oviraptor is full combo, it is insane with Scrap Wyvern in general, and my fave start for this deck is the occasional weirdness where you're using Accesscode Talker to pop a Lost World Token to start your actual Dinosaur combos (it does happen, and it hilarious), although I've since included Knightmare Cerberus to do that job quite well since that happened, so it is probably not a thing you'll ever do going first anymore.  3 Fossil Dig. So, these are effectively 3 more copies of all of your main Dinosaur combo cards and extenders, this is the glue that holds the combo together. I agonized slightly on whether to include 2 or 3 of these at some point, but I do think the full 3 copies are pretty close to necessary, even if it does open you up to more interruptions than some other starts - it does so marginally, and is otherwise the card that ties the consistency together.  1 Foolish Burial is effectively another copy of Misc, because Misc starts are insane. You give up the protection, but it does the combo, and realistically there are still a lot of great choke points when you Misc anyways, the important thing is specialing a Dino. It actually doubles as a third copy of token Collector, and in a pinch usually has something to send for value (usually Giant Rex, which sort of makes it a ""free"" extender, or a baby, which Oviraptor specials to extend combos, usually using the Scrap engine). But ideally, this is either Misc or Token Collector.  1 Misc. This is such an important card in the deck, it makes it very hard to interact with my Dinos if I see it in the hand. Probably more importantly, it specials dinos from the deck out of the GY, usually Archosaur to pop baby search pill, or else banishing itself and Archosaur to special baby, then use Oviraptor to pop baby (summon baby, summon Scrap Raptor, etc). The main card in the deck! Also, Sometimes this is Pankratops, and that's always fun.  2 Oviraptor made the final list. The math is like this - this is 7 copies of Misc I have to start my combos, just under a quarter of the deck, or rather a card I am very likely to open. There are also 5 copies of Oviraptor itself to start plays, counting the 3 Fossil Dig. That means I'm reasonably likely to see 1 copy, but reasonably likely not to see 2 - now consider that 3 of those redundant copies are actually full combo with Oviraptor, and that Oviraptor gets searched out by Archosaur + Baby, which is still full combo... But meanwhile, I'm pretty unlikely to see both actual copies of Oviraptor at the same time (and worst-case scenario, a back-up for follow-ups or to destroy with UCT is pretty sweet anyways) and I literally cannot clog on this card - there aren't technically enough copies. I did consider a 3rd copy for the grind game (sometimes, weirdly enough, full combo will use 2 Oviraptors even though the 2nd is bunk, killing followups) but mathemathically it really was a choice between Fossil Dig and Oviraptor, and the fact that Oviraptor x2 is not full combo and Oviraptor + Dig is makes things feel a lot better this way.  2 Token Collector have to make the cut. Honestly, it could be 3 in this deck, however, my mentality towards hand traps and cards in general with a HOPT has shifted - it isn't that I think they are bad, or would never run 3, but it seems like there's a glut of good interactive cards that exist in the format, and I'd rather run a pair of hand traps to do a job and know that I'm less likely to see multiples of the same hand trap, and this has actually even been increasingly true of my engine cards too, particularly when there are consistency cards I can run instead of my engine card. With Foolish Burial there are a lot of great Token Collector combo starts, and the fact that the card is often insanely live as a combo piece (sometimes even literally being the card that pulls a bad hand together) makes it do double duty. I think it is great to have this here with Brave being everywhere, and Auroradon still, y'know, existing, being present, and while I'm not convinced it should be a Dino staple, this format it puts in work being 2 of my interactive cards vs Brave going second (3 going first) and a good combo piece that's also a lvl 4 extender (and maybe STILL an interruption??). This mentality towards HOPT hands traps could shift, but I think it would take Maxx ""C"" or something equally as powerful and centralizing to do that tbh.  I'm running 1 Ash because I heard 1 Ash = GG.  Okay, okay, this is card #3 vs Brave engine, which is what I'm maining for. It makes the cut because it is flexible, and because I'm trying not to run too many HOPT cards next to each other.  Ghost Ogre is actually good right now, which makes me a liar, because I swore Ghost Ogre was just always bad. But it is good - it can help answer Gryphon Rider and Adventure in a great way and has some actual utility against a lot of the engines these Brave DPE decks tend to merge well with. Also weirdly good against a lot of the Rogue decks that might have a chance of countering this Meta, since many of them have either a Field Spell or a Continuous Spell or Trap that they use to game the system. It definitely helps that against ""The Meta"" it is THE thing that does the job, and that against the Rogue decks that actually stand up to the Meta it still does work. Ofc you still can't count on it to singlehandedly win you games the way some higher impact cards can, but it also is just the best at what it does right now.  1 Called By was always making the list, but I'm being a cheatyface and pretending this is a good answer to DPE+Scythe. If you're worried about the Scythe lock it can do work, and it can also catch out DPE (assuming you dealt with the Gryphon Rider) or even in some sitchs be the way you keep Celestial from helping them outgrind you, so it does have applications. But also, the card is just nuts in general, and obvy ends up being a great way to answer hand traps going first (which is why it is kind of cheating to think of it as a tool against DPE+Scythe engines - you'll often use it on something else first!)  1 Cosmic Cyclone is also coming in on the basis of being a DPE + Scythe card, and it does technically keep the Scythe lock from going up. But it makes the cut over something more obvious like Effect Veiler for being a very good very specific out for problematic Spells/Traps that TECHNICALLY has utility against DPE + Scythe. Funnily enough, it has utility against Adventures too, which makes it kind of a nice bridge between the two suites.  3 Imperm is 3 Imperm. The card is obviously nuts in general, this is one of those hand traps that always makes my decks even when I'm not too keen on running a lot of hand traps. But also, in this meta, you can hold one copy for Verte or burn an extra on Dagda, or even hold onto it for your turn and use it to push through your board. The fact that it isn't a HOPT, as well as the silly stuff you can do with the spell negate, at least on occasion (even if they never play into it, I can set it where I want, capiche?) makes it something between a staple and an all-star (and I'd argue they might even want to consider semi-limiting it, it sees at least as much play as Called By did back when they limited that). These are copies 3-5 of the anti-DPE package.  So, we have 5 ""Solemns"" and 2 of them are Judgment, and 3 of them are Zefra Divine Strike. Divine Strike is basically just Strike stapled to Judgement, except you can't negate summons, and it costs a space in your extra deck... Sign me up! These are primarily here to answer Spells and Traps, particularly blowout Spells and Traps, but also particularly Countertraps. Divine Strike is well worth running over Judgment, it can end chains the same way Strike can while also answering Counter Traps and Spells - freaking wild, and well worth the 3 spaces in the Extra deck. It does mean no Extravagance, but TBH I've had some serious problems with Extravagance in Dinosaur for as long as I can remember - I dunno, I feel like Dinos needs MOST of its extra deck, and then has a FEW extra slots it doesn't need, but randomly banishing Secure Gardna and seeing a low-end UCT you can no longer make feels bad, and that kind of thing happened to me in Dinosaur a lot with Extravagance. Regardless, my approach was to pile on spell negates, pretty reasonable since Apollousa is the main boss monster we're trying to make, if only to bait out the Nib, and we're running Imperm. Still, that both of these flex as answers to Monsters as well as ways to end chains and respond to Countertraps make them a sweet suite.  2 Archosaur and 2 Pill is pretty standard. It is pretty simple logic - you would run 1 of each, but if you see the first copy of either your combo would often get killed and/or gimped in that case, so you run 2 of each, which works great actually, because Archosaur + Baby is full combo, and Baby + Pill (or even Archosaur + Pill or Archosaur + dino) equals an easy cheesy UCT. I actually love these numbers given the little packages of 5 (1/8th) the deck creates because, oh, look at that, 3 Dig + 2 Archosaur = 5.  Holy Babycerasaurus Batman! Yep, I'm on all 3 Babies (+1 Petiteranodon). There's some reason for this. It largely does, in fact, boil down to the card not being a HOPT. In your usual combo, what I typically call ""full combo"" you'll use up either 3 babies, or 2 babies and 1 terano. That means, really, you only need to run 2 babies and 1 terano to do full combo. And in terms of starting hands, 2 Babies, 3 Fossil Dig and 1 Petiteranodon for the ""mini"" combo is actually acceptable, to say the least. It may even be better, at least in some ways, since you can NS baby and pop baby in hand for some of your combos, but the third baby is just UCT bait. But the deck summons babies from the deck like wild, it pops babies in the deck like wild. A 3rd baby is the difference between access to Pank and not. A 3rd baby is the difference between 2 Lost World being redundant, and 2 Lost World being freaking wild. A 3rd baby just in the deck sometimes is all the difference. Also, having all 3 Baby when Baby is needed for most of your combo starts does slightly improve the number of hands that combo off. It also slightly increases the general ""brickiness"" problems created with some hands (For instance, it makes possible the 5 ""baby"" hand, and while that is an extreme case, 2 babies and 3 hand traps remains sad) but I think the trade-off is quite acceptable considering the utility this offers you during your main combos. Giant Rex is the ""unnoficial"" baby. This guy makes Rank 4 Xyz plays and Lvl 8 plays possible mostly, but is a decent little beater in his own right, and you're basically choosing between this guy and Petitteranodan at the end of your main combo, depending on the rest of your plays and your matchup.  The Scrap engine is here. Scrap Raptor is a Dino and can be summoned off of any baby (including terano). It can pop itself to instantly make Scrap Wyvern, which in turn can extend your plays by popping babies, or even better, popping Lost World tokens to pop babies from the deck. It can also just pop a baby by itself before going into Wyvern - Wyvern pops Raptor, Raptor searches Chimera, NS Chimera, Summon Raptor, BOOM Rank 4 Xyz. With a little work this can also help set up Omega, and with Apollo you can force Nib while enabling UCT, meaning if they Nib early it might not be enough, but if they Nib too late they've just given you a lot of free advantage. Also, just nutty going second. Raptor + Lost World is a great combo by itself, which weirdly enough really helps the deck by creating more Dinos that just straight combo with Lost World by themselves.  2 UCT, 1 Pank. What is there to say? UCT is like, the main point of playing Dinos, especially right now. Pankratops seems a little weak this format, but the card is always insane, just generically, and this is Dinosaur, where free Panks from the deck are just, like, always on the table. I want more Panks, quite badly, which is probably a good sign this is a good limit.  In the extra deck, we have 3 Zefra Metaltron. TBH this just enables our Strikes, but you will occasionally use Metaltron as a stepping stone for Apollousa and Accesscode, and oddly enough, the banish ability is actually pretty relevant, since the deck can flood the board. However, in general, don't summon this card, unless you really have to - this is a brick for Divine Strike. If you just, like, run 3 Judgment and tech in stuff like Red Reboot and Feather Duster you'll make back all of those points against Trap decks, but lose a lot of utility against generic board breaking spells, as well as the ability to end chains. Solemn Strikes could end chains as a replacement for these as well, but again, you lose points against Backrow and Sweepers. Mind you, don't feel married to 3 Divine Strike if you have other tech calls to make (main or side). There's every chance that Ice Dragon's Prison and I:P is better in your meta - but consider this - Divine Strike really does do the better part of both of the best Solemns.  Scrap Wyvern is nuts, this is the main combo engine of the deck, the Needlefibre as it were. This is the broken Link 2 that pulls it all together going first, AND pops cards going second. I actually forgot this one in the feelsy list, but by the second attempt it was in.  1 Unicorn. I like Unicorn. Wyvern into Unicorn into Accesscode is just... Really good. Especially if you made an Almiraj somewhere.  1 Knightmare Cerberus. This one is... Weird? But I kept running into situations where I simultaneously wanted a generic way to pop a Lost World token and a way to discard, and this is that. Also, under Wyvern it draws a card, so that's neat. This could really be Tornado Dragon or Phoenix if you're expecting a lot of Eldlich or Geist or even backrow heavy versions of other engines, and those might be better at the rogue level for locals. But Cerberus is still an interactive card most of the time, and is also a weird consistency card in this deck. It's a lot easier to make a Cerberus to start combo plays than Accesscode after all.  Apollousa. Just a way to make sure you bait the Nib, make the Nib math hard. Also, I've heard it negates monster effects sometimes. Bagooska will help this not get beaten over.  Accesscode. What is there to say? If I'm going second, I want to pop a bunch of cards and beat in for game.  Evolzar Laggia is the only Evolzar to make the cut in the deck. Dolkka is better in terms of pure value, but this deck actually specifically needs ways to negate Spells and Traps a lot more than monster effects, so Dolkka seems redundant, whereas this is just good insurance.  Bagooska is great. Go you drunk animal, go! I'm fond of this card with Apollousa, but I'm also fond of this card going second to really force people's hands. Don't make this with Token Collector or Giant Rex tho, unless you really need to.  Abyss Dweller is Abyss Dweller. Not only is it generically quite good right now, it adds to the complexity of the simplified game state, or to put in another way, it reduces the lines of play opponents have to make in a situation where their lines of play are already limited by other factors. Also, UCT can eat it pretty much right away, and in a pinch it can even send something like a Giant Rex to the GY right away to help extend while creating a floodgate effect. Obviously, its utility will vary by matchup, but I like that it does some work against both of the ""main"" engines this format, for obvious reasons.  Almiraj and Linkuriboh are here to make a bunch of easy cheesy UCTs and fill the GY with Link monsters with different attributes. Summon Kurbioh or Almiraj early and often, before summon 5 if you can, to help ensure Pill isn't trash.  Omega is a grind game card. If your opponent's plan is to burn down their hand to disrupt you, making Omega becomes more appealing, but weirdly enough the best thing about the card is recycling Misc. Also great with the Gamma in the side. This is the card you use when you're pretty sure you can simplify the gamestate and live the turn, but aren't sure if your board will be broken. For example, against Tenyi and Swordsoul cards, you might be really hard-pressed not to end up in a pretty simplified board state no matter what, or against Prank-Kids as well, or against Rank 8 Spam. Sphere Mode is going to hurt, and there's no way of getting around it. Even weaker, grindy stuff like Salad might just keep you from making much aside from UCT and then just set up for the long haul. But limiting your opponent's options, setting yourself up for recovery, and knowing something is coming back at the start of your turn? That's priceless.  Side deck is wild man. Okay, I wanted more Cosmic and 1 Reboot, and that is pretty standard for me. But I decided I didn't really need Evenly, and I'm really not feeling it right now. Instead I decided to pile up on 2 ofs of hand traps, all chosen on the basis that they have some utility against Brave, DPE, or Scythe (or more than 1) while also being blowouts depending on the engine run with Brave, DPE + Scythe. At that point, I was also running all of the hand traps that scare me, including literally Ghost Ogre (wait, that's not correct is it?). So, I decided throw in 2 Gamma, which is half-decent as an anti-handtrap card in this deck sometimes and is also insane going second a lot of the time, and 3 Crossout, which now has amazing targets, including Gamma, for 5 more anti-handtrap cards to go with Called. I also included 1 Driver, because Gamma deserves a friend, and Gorramit I do too!  I'm an idiot, but a smart one. Solemns in, reading the card explains the card! XD"

Epigonen already provides a lot of versatility and consistency. Having a copy of Emergency Teleport in hand, while running PSY-Framegear Gamma allows for one to go an extensive combo so the have a decent starting hand consisting of Union Hanger, an ABC piece, or some other combination. This combo relies on one going into Coral Dragon and then into Baroness. By popping a summoned Platinum Gadget with Baroness, you can then special summon Gold Gadget to summon another ABC monster from your hand to go into the like of either Verte or I:P. If you start with Epigonen, as well, you can end up with both Verte and I:P, allowing for you to summon Destroy Phoenix Enforcer which you can then use to pop Verte, itself. I typically detest bloated ABC fields which stop Dragon Buster from tagging out which is why I prefer running DPE rather than Dragoon here. Besides, Baroness has the capability to negate by itself.  I'm also running Mystic Mine here since the combination of Coral Dragon, Baroness, Dragon Buster, and DPE should give you plentiful means to pop it should you be forced to give it to your opponent as a result of Set Rotation.  Still, I should once again make it clear that this ABC build is extremely experimental and is constantly being adjusted. The number of soft garnets in the deck is room for concern so I'm not sure if having more than forty cards in the main deck is necessarily a bad thing but do have other variations of this which run less than forty-two cards in the main deck."

Added deck strategy.  A flexible deck, every other duel you could draw the cards needed for invoked summoning, or shaddoll summoning. Either work very well, or if you're lucky both.  Invoked strategy: You draw an aleister the invoker? Normal summon, and add invocation to your hand, you link summon Artemis the magistus moon maiden, and then fusion summon Invoked Mechaba using Invocation.  Dogmatika/Albaz strategy: I use dogmatika and albaz for a monster negate and monster removal, useful for monsters that cant be destroyed by battle or card effects. I use albaz to tribute opponents troublesome monsters. Dogmatika monsters have OTK potential, and could be used as fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct and Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll strategy: You want to efficiently use your flip monster effects here, Reeshaddoll Wendi is a great card and the most aggressive. Ideally you would want to get Winda out there as a special summon limiter. Shaddoll Schism is your ace in the hole, you will want it in a long game.  My thoughts: I like to run 3 Cosmic Cyclone here because Skill drain is such a terrible card to encounter. And 3 Crossout Designator because I was sick of my opponents always playing handtraps, both have been good additions.

I made this decklist inspired in another one really similar from the Public Decks in the MD Deck Create room, and it showcases that D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kali Yuga is a real problem if the combo made to summon it to the Field isn't stopped properly, just like many other cards in the cardpool (Herald, Rhongo, etc., you can figure the rest).  The problem is, this deck can make the full combo that stops your opponent for entirely playing the game alongside getting 8k+ damage for the turn 3 with only 2 specific cards or any 3 card combo that can leave Force Strix + ANY DARK EXTENDER. Obviously, you need to play uninterrupted, and that's why the deck is equipped with a full-on Crossout Designator package that includes Ash, Nibiru, Infimp, Maxx ""C"" (at 3, that card may be the best card in the entire game period) and Called by (which you obviously want to see in your opener too). 5/40 cards are there to stop your opponent from stopping you, since you can't make full combo and also get a negate before the 5th summon, and Nib absolutely screws your plans.  Anyways, Tribute Lanius (or Summoner Monk + Spell for that matter) + Raider's Wing is full combo. Normal Tribute, effect to send to GY, send Mimicry (the one you never want in your opener), Mimicry effect in GY to search Pain Lanius, Pain effect to summon itself paying 400 targeting Tribute, XYZ summon Force Strix, search Singing Lanius, Raider's effect to summon itself detaching from Force, Singing summon itself because you have an XYZ monster. You now have 3 monsters in the Field and 3 cards in hand.  Link summon Wise Strix using everything but Raider's Wing (to avoid banishing it in any case the combo fails), summon from the Deck any Raidraptor (here you want Mimicry if you couldn't mill and search from it before), XYZ into another Force Strix, search literally anything and activate the 2nd effect of Wise to set a  PK Rank-Up Magic Force from the Deck (you will clearly be activating it this turn). Notice you will be keeping the last 3 cards in hand, and you now have a searched card from Force. If you opened a copy of Strangle Lanius, don't search it specifically, you will be summoning one from the Deck later, and also it locks you into DARK monsters, which you want to avoid if your opponent disrupts your next play.  Next, bring out Rusty Bardiche leaving the XYZ monster with 1 material (and that makes a lot of difference, it truly matters), then Rusty effect sending Boots to the GY to set Shade Brigandine. You don't want to set the RUM Launch (specially going second) to avoid any S/T destruction your opponent may have. Boots effect in GY next banishing itself to search Launch. If everything goes as planned from here, you won the game 99.99% of the time.  Activate RUM Force targeting Force Lanius and summon Arsenal Falcon, it should keep 2 materials. Arsenal effect (leaving Force Strix as material) to summon Strangle from Deck, and activate its effect to bring back any LV4 Raidraptor from the GY. Here, overlay the 2 LV4 monsters you have to XYZ summon Gagagaga Magician in a zone Rusty points to, to prock Rusty's destruction targeting Arsenal Falcon. If Arsenal has a ""Raidraptor"" monster as material, when it's sent to the GY, he will bring out Ultimate Falcon and attach itself as material. Inmediately after, detach from Ultimate to lock your opponent out of monster effects but, most importantly, getting Arsenal to the GY.  Last but not least, activate Gagagaga Magician's effect to bring back the Arsenal Falcon from the GY with no XYZ materials, and if you're going first, you can perfectly pass from here before setting the Launch. As soon as you're allowed, activate said RUM Launch to summon Kali Yuga on top of Arsenal Falcon, and anything your opponent did and does in/after the chain you're summoning Kali Yuga will be negated. Your opponent can't play the game really (Kali Yuga's Azathot like effect procks instantly and last until the end of the turn), and you have 2k + 3.5k + 3.5k + 2.1k damage (well over lethal) and a Quick-Effect Harpie's Feather Duster.  This painful combo happens quite consistently and with the correct cards, your opponent will need 3 interruptions to make it unviable. Your backup plan is UDF to negate and steal, Zeus if you're going second and can't OTK, or most likely if you lost the coin toss, Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon, summonable with Raider's Knight.  Even if you can't full combo, almost always the deck can end on a Arsenal Falcon that needs to be banished or bounced in order to avoid its floating effect to bring an inmune 3.5k beatstick that can shut the opponent down from monster effects, burns and decreases attack on top. But anyways, Force Strix + a DARK monster (considering you haven't used Raider's Wing effect to get there) is full combo uninterrupted, and you can play from there really.  Never banish 6 from Prospy. You always want to banish 3, and in my consideration the cards you for sure don't miss if you get out of your EX are Zeus, one Force Strix and one Gagagaga Magician. The rest is quite important. Maybe the UFD package is missable if you're going 2nd and can't OTK through Prosperity, but consider your options.  A board going 2nd with Rusty, Ultimate Falcon, Gagagaga Magician and Arc Rebellion has 10600 ATK. OTKing the turn you used Prosperity is viable, but you need your opponent having some monster(s) on the Field.  Kagetokage and Curtain Riser are in the deck as a XYZ enabler post and pre Normal Summon respectively. And you don't really need Shade, but any extender is welcome in this combo festival.  Important note, if you can full combo going 1st to get to Kali, Maxx ""C"" is not a problem really, considering you have ways to stop Ash and Nibiru specifically (e.g Called by and Crossout, both of them), so, if in your opener you have full combo + the 2 anti-handtrap measure cards, your targets should be those 2 and not Maxx ""C"".  Considering Prosperity is a HOPT (and thank God for that) and that this decklist plays 3of, you may want to replace one copy of Prospy for an Effect Veiler or a Ghost Belle, to make sure you have enough Crossout targets. I don't recommend it, but it's viable.  The deck is not really fun to play in the long term, nor cheap, nor interactive in most cases, but it wins, it wins a LOT, it isn't a pure coinflip (since you have your contingency plans or cards specifically made for going 2nd such as Droplet, Zeus, Arc, LS or Duster), it's somewhat versatile (even if the best it can do is the full lockout I explained before) and, in my experience, most of my opponents didn't know when to interrupt it correctly (the best disruption window is CLEARLY the Wise Strix summon, even more if you can destroy it with a Gamma for example). But most important, 7/10 times the combo goes off (or is for sure going off and the opponent knows that) the surrender is inmediate and you almost feel you made your opponent lose their time. So take that in mind if you decide to run this abomination."

Focusing on playing a pile of extender with just the right ratio of hand traps to open with 80% chance 1 and with 50% chance 2 with the other cards being extender.  The main goal of the deck is to set up sphere + 2 negates or Auroradon + 2 negates and a set up gy for the next turn if you went first. If you went second you usually can push straight for game against most boards.  &nbsp;  The spice lies in having the new meteor dragon as a way to loop black metal dragon into Ravine + Sphere while only using your normal summon and combo from there into either Sheou + Savage or go all out into Auroradon.  The deck takes some time to get used to to play but rewards you with plenty of lines of play even through negates and you will rarely stand there without interaction durring your opponents turn, if you go second or first.

Also more fun to play and bann list safer,"Alright, there are two reasons why you are here and not looking at tournament decks. Either you bought a full Swordsoul core and not want to spend more money just to swap to the new hot stuff that gets banned soon and now search for a way to keep playing the expensive cards you got OR you have no patience for Punk dia note and want to play this Amazing ( dragon ) archtype already.  Oh boy I got just the list for you. This deck does just what adventure tenyi rose dragon swordsoul ect. Does but cheaper and with a bit more explosive plays that catch people by suprise. The downside is a slightly higher brick chance ending with to many hand traps / traps. So if you dont mind that every tenth game, than this deck will still be something for you.  So lets go into this card by card followed by some combos.  First of all the classic cards :  3x Red Rose Dragon  1x Roxrose Dragon  1x Basal Rose Shoot  3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara  3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna  3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda  This is the most classical part of the deck. The main thing about it, is summon a big tenyi , summon red rose dragon , make baroness than use the rose dragons to go into Halq which is protected by Baroness omni negate. There are other ways to make this but this is the most simple version and usually the safest.  The Swordsouls:  1x Swordsoul of Mo Ye  1x Swordsoul of Taia  1x Swordsoul Strategist Longyuan  You rarely want to open them as they require a other card in hand and your normal summon, Long is probably still the best of the bunch to burn and make Baroness but usually you want to get to them later in your combo.  The Punks :  3xNoh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune  2x Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin  1x Joruri-P.U.N.K. Madame Spider  1xJoruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu  3x Emergency Teleport  Iam gonna include Etele as punk here even though you can also summon Ogre of it. But the punks are basically 1 card Halqs / replace the Rose dragons when it comes to make a Baroness without normal summoning. Madam spider also spins use a nice little negate to hand for time win / discard fodder/ or simple negating stuff. They allow us to either set up a safer enviroment for our combo / play through negates / bait hand traps and make sure carbogeddon gets to gy. Including Ghost ogre we also have 3 names for Amazing Dragon which is really Amazing to have when playing Amazing Dragon  Spice like mayonaise :  2x Carboneddon  1xFlamvell Guard  1xAlexandrite Dragon  This is a new combo piece that recently came up in a few lists. You have a few more normal monsters that allow you to use the tenyi effects in gy and sending / discarding Carboneddon allows you to also get free extender material. This also makes Carboneddon a 1 card halq through Almirah. See ? Salamangreat are still good and playable. Just dont play the bad cards lmao  1x Deskbot  Its deskbot. you love him you hate him Konami will take him~  1x Fairy Tail - Snow  Send it somehow to gy and just loop it while your opponent asks themself why this card came of the list while you agree followed by asking for response knowing you just ruined their day &lt;3  1x Foolish Burial  Sends carboneddon/ Snow to be live or any tenyi you wanna use.  Hand traps :  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  2x Effect Veiler  3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit  3x Nibiru, the Primal Being  2x Forbidden Droplet  2xInfinite Impermanence  Basically you will see to 80% one of them and to 50% two. It helps your even weaker boards to usually hold the game in your favor and going second will make the board of your opponent soft enough to crack.  1x Swordsoul Blackout  Blackout pop 2 or banish to extend. Nothing to interesting to see here. Its as blant as its rarity.  Extra deck :  1x Baronne de Fleur  the card protecting Halq basically and one of Konamis meanest jokes to push display sales  1x Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing  Spins cards back to deck and extends afterwards, would love to play 2x  1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi  Just to push for games, can probably cut it for Baxia  1x Geomathmech Final Sigma  You see Floowander birds, you make this. And you just win. Nothing more to say, they cant out it, and you dont need to think anymore after making it. Win Win  1x Herald of the Arc Light  A lot of decks cant play under this and also its a free negate. You usually make it when you do your halq combo and have an ashuna in gy  1x Shooting Riser Dragon  Makes sure you can also syncro summon in your opponents turn, makes a negated Halq useful and can send either Snow / Token Collector which wins a few match ups. Its also the card you usually use for Amamzing Dragon  1xSwordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao  Searches your extender and is a negate  after wards. Yeah this card is broken  1x Swordsoul Sinister Sovereign - Qixing Longyuan  The best level 10 Syncro in the game as it stops a lot of the current meta decks and singel handly wins the Invoced match up. Also the burn comes up a lot against all the current decks who pay 2000 for verte / stall for time  / pay half for destrudo etc  1x Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon  This card allows you to break boards, bounce 3 in opponents turn and push for game in yours. Its just AMAZING! and a Dragon .... well a sea serpent  1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing  The heart of your Halq combo and way into the Swordsouls. Pop it with baroness or your auroradon and get a free 8 sync + level 10. This card sadly will take the fall for Halqs sins I feel  1x Crystron Halqifibrax  Summon desk bot in your turn or shooting riser in the opponents.  1x <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</span>  Summon deskbot......wait Deja vu  2x <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Monk of the Tenyi</span>  Can probably go to 1, but makes your Tenyi live  1x Salamangreat Almiraj  You only play this to make carboneddon live really, but I guess the effect can come up?  The side deck is pretty standart so not much to say. Usually I either side the rose dragon engine out or the carboneddon depending on how much I need to side in.  &nbsp;  For any questions , just write in the comments and I will get to it.  &nbsp;"

The entire deck is dependent on Elemental Hero Sunrise. It only takes two HERO monsters to fusion summon it onto the field. When it's summoned, you can grab a miracle fusion from the deck and immediately summon another powerful Elemental Hero fusion summon from the extra deck. Sunrise is very powerful because when you attack with another HERO monster, you can destroy a card on the opponent's side of the field. This includes the monster you are attacking. This makes it easy to remove pesky spells/traps when in the battle phase, as well as removing monsters that are difficult to destroy through battle.  This deck makes it very easy to get fusion spells out of the deck with Elemental Hero Blazeman and Sunrise. It's also very easy to search for any elemental hero card you want out of the deck using Elemental Hero Stratos, Elemental Hero Shadow Mist, Masked Hero Dian, and E-Emergency Call. There are plenty of special summoning cards and graveyard padding cards to make it very easy to get cards onto the field to activate their effects.  There are also several cards that allow you to draw outside the draw phase. Elemental Hero Liquid Soldier can be used as a draw 2 and it can send cards to the graveyard from your hand. There are also cards like Pot of Duality, Masked Hero Divine Wind, and Elemental Hero Nova Master that draw cards.  This deck also has plenty of spell/trap removal using Stratos, Sunrise, Masked Hero Acid, Masked Hero Blast, and R-Righteous Justice.  One of the best combos in the deck involves Masked Hero Acid and Elemental Hero Absolute Zero. When Absolute Zero leaves the field, all monsters the opponent controls are destroyed. When Acid is summoned, all spells/traps the opponent controls are destroyed. Using a Mask Change on Absolute Zero can bring Acid onto the field and completely board wipe the opponent. I usually go for this combo when going for lethal.  Using this deck, I have consistently summoned 2-4 fusion monsters on the field in one turn. This deck works really well as a ""go second"" deck since it has plenty of answers to any traps that could have been laid. There are also times where this deck can FTK.  Elemental Heroes have always been one of my favorite archetypes and this is one of the most fun decks I've ever played!

Epigonen, the Impersonation Invader is a crucial card which is why it's featured in so many of my current ABC builds. The card revitalizes otherwise dead hands and gives the deck a better degree of consistency, an expanded level of versatility, and allows for the creation of stronger first turn boards. Typically, you'll want to end on Dragon Buster, Dragoon, Masquerena, and Verte with this build.  You can even prevent a card like Veiler or Impermanence from negating Verte's effect by banishing Verte from the field with Dragon Buster. This variation of the deck utilizes Dragoon over DPE as I appreciate Dragoon's ability to aid in OTKing and its negation effect.  I'm still running a decent line-up of handtraps so as to increase one's ability to stand firm should one's opponent be going first. I'll always have a soft spot for the PSY-Framegear Gamma engine and am still running a copy of PSY-Framelord Omega given how devastating it can be for your opponent if you summon that card after negating a handtrap used against you on your own turn before you've summoned a monster.  While I prefer running two copies of Union Driver, I've decided to run only one in order take full advantage of the fact that Skill Drain is unlimited considering its interaction with ABC Dragon Buster, itself. I'm tempted to cut a copy of Skill Drain, though, or some other card in order to bring the deck back down to forty cards with a forty card build being another variation of this deck that I'm testing.  It's worth noting that running only one Union Driver isn't as detrimental anymore when you have Epigonen considering you can tribute a copy of Crush Wyvern via Epigonen's effect, special summon Union Driver with Wyvern's effect, and proceed to equip Driver to the token summoned by Epigonen before proceeding with the regular shenanigans.  The side deck is still up to major debate as is whether to utilize Pseudo Space, Cynet Universe, or Mystic Mine in the main deck. I prefer Pseudo Space, at the moment, since it serves as an extender which better enables the creation of optimal boards and aids in the accumulation of card advantage, a necessity given how both Dragon Buster and Dragoon require cards to discard to activate some of their most useful effects. There's also no fear if you give it to your opponent as a result of Set Rotation.  I also could see an argument for adjusting the extra deck a bit considering that while Omega is devastating, it only appears in quite specific scenarios whereas something like Knightmare Cerberus, Lambda, and Lyna the Light Charmer can be more consistently brought out with each of those cards having their own benefits.  I'm torn between Borrelsword and Avramax, with Borrelsword being a great boss monster to fall back on while Avramax is a great boss to summon with Masquerena in the event of your Dragon Buster being hit with a card like Called by the Grave after attempting to tag out. Borrelsword, on the other hand, is rather easy to summon with the aid of Epigonen especially when you run Link Spider.  Link Spider is a necessity in the extra deck, regardless of whether you run Borrelsword or Avaramax, considering it can be used to easily summon Verte so long as you open with Epigonen and any other summonable monster, even Ash Blossom, no matter how dead the rest of your hand is. . That last point also ties into another reason why I prefer Dragoon to DPE is because if you start with that aforementioned nearly dead hand, ending on a lone Dragoon is usually more difficult to get over than a lone DPE.  Link Spider is also necessary if you want to summon an Apollousa with four negates on your first turn which is a valid option if  you either know or  believe your opponent has Nibiru."

Random extender combos  2 lvl 7's and a random card into the absolute&gt; cross sheep&gt; vortex combo then use cross sheep and the random monster to go into dagda or verte.  Using mithrilium as link material so it floats into a Metalfoes monster then do the dpe scythe stuff easier.  Using metalfoes monsters to set 2 combination, then using magician souls to send the 2 set metalfoes combination to draw 2 and add 2 etc etc I suck at writing the guides so have a video that explains better.

In case you didn't already know, Fallen of Albaz is, hands down, my favorite card in all of YU-GI-OH!. So how could I come join this community (I only just joined yesterday) without showing you all the deck I love most? The answer is I couldn't! And so now all of you get to view my very own creation:  Albaz Despia Dogmatika.  Not only do I love Albaz, I also get a good groove playing it's partners-in-lore: Despia and Dogmatika. Yes, you heard me right: Albaz is a story that plays out in the cards, a card lore. Search on youtube.com 'Albaz lore' to learn more!  Anyway, about the deck. My baby is based off of the very lore of Albaz, but that does not mean I didn't think that Despia and Dogmatika were actually good achetypes to partner Albaz, though some of you might think it a terrible idea to play Dogmatika with a deck whose main win condition is it's Extra Deck. Well, for those who think that look at this way: Not only does the deck prevail in Extra Deck plays, but it also has an engine which can counter the very familiar meta decks that use it. And, please, notice that you <em>can</em>, if need be (which, tbh, need probably will be), replace the Dogmatika cards with those from the ever helpful Side Deck. You don't have to use Dogmatika; it's just there if you wish to. And now about the deck.  You'll notice that the deck is OCG, even though I myself only have ever played the TCG. That's because in this profile I wanted to include the new cards that are getting released in <em>Structure Deck: Albaz Strike</em>, which is coming out on April 8th. Other then those cards, all the other cards are available in the TCG, so once <em>Albaz Strike</em> is released and <strong>Tri-Brigade Mercourier, Springans Kitt, Unlikely Swordsoul Allies, Paradise Branded, Branded Fusion, Branded Condemnation, Branded Blade, Lubellion the Searing Dragon and Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong> with it, this deck will be fully TCG.  My beautiful (my deck) mainly focuses on turboing out the Albaz fusions, but it can also win with the Despian fusion monsters and even the Dogmatika monsters, when used with <strong>Dogmatika Nation</strong>. The new <strong>Tri-Brigade Mercourier </strong>is a nice negate, and <strong>Unlikely Swordsoul Allies </strong>can summon any Dogmatika except <strong>Dogmatika Nexus</strong>.  If you use any fusion card to sent <strong>Despian Tradegy</strong> to the GY or banish it, you can add any Despia monster except itself from your deck to your hand, which allows instant combos, especially if you add <strong>Aluber the Jester of Despia</strong>, which lets you search any Branded Spell/Trap and also is a very powerful negate.  Going second is always your go to with this deck, because then your opponent can set up their board for you to break it. If they don't have the right monsters for you to fuse with, no worries! <strong>Radian</strong> and <strong>Jizukiru</strong> are there to help. Remember this is just a example of what the deck can look like. Feel free to play three of the best cards and also add your own, like <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> and <strong>Super Poly</strong>. Not to say the deck I made isn't playable or isn't any good, but for sure, you can definitely follow your own deck building flow. Tbh I didn't play three of some cards because I wanted to make room for others. I still think my deck is totally sweet, though.  You can bring out <strong>Mysterion the Dragon Crown</strong> by using a Dogmatika as material, and <strong>Keeper of Dragon Magic</strong> gets you materials and searches <strong>Fusion Substitute</strong>. Some might say <strong>Masquerade</strong> is a waste of time, but trust me, it's better then you think. Same with <strong>Maximus</strong>. You can also side out Extra Deck monsters you think are not necessary for different ones.  <em><strong>And Now Comes The Most Important Part!</strong></em>  Have fun.  I know it might sound cheesy, but having fun is what YU-GI-OH! is all about. I have no doubt that that is the full intention of the game: to make memories, to smile.  Have fun with this insane and sweet <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> deck. Enjoy, and feel free to share any ideas in the comments."

Currently it works quite well, it can still be improved and with the next season we hope to be able to optimize the deck more.  For more details here I leave the sample video:    The main strategy consists of quickly summoning Beta and then being able to ritual summon Idaten (it will return our ritual spell card to our hand many times) to be able to perform various combos. Then with another Beta and the Diviner of the Herald we can special summon Ultimaya and F0 Utopic."

A single (uninterrupted) Hajun can turn into an Absolute Zero and a veritable Drident that floats on destruction. This paired with Balerdroch's continuous board prescnce and Eldlich's recursiveness (and generic zombie support) creates what I think can may be able to break into the meta. Granted, this deck is not going to be tier 1 or higher, but I believe it will be a semi-competitive deck that can actually see some success in the wake of Adventure, Phantom Knights, and combo Eldlich.  &nbsp;  Some notes:  <span>3x Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi:</span> This card is what is going to help push Mayakashi into meta contention. A link-3 that special summons the synchros from the GY on a quick effect best thing the archetype could have recieved, and is why I think it should be ran at 3 copies. The awesome part about this card is how it works with the link-2. If you link into the link-2, special summon Dakki, and the link up to the link-3, you can link back down into the link-2, special summon Dakki, and link back up again, letting you dump 2-3 of Icicle to the grave in a single turn. This does force you to play two of the link-2, which isn't great but is necessary.  <span>x2 Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi and Shiranui's Tale:</span> This card, in my opinion, is more of a gimmick than anything else. It's effect is absolutely busted, don't get me wrong, and will absolutely win you games if you can resolve it, but if you don't have access to your synchros or links it's more or less just a brick in hand. The number one issue with Mayakashi is how easy it is to stop it's main combo. An Ash, Imperm, or Veiler, will pretty much kill your Hajun's effect (which is why having Eldlich to fall back on is so important), and if your combo gets killed then you can't really make use of this card. Only playing two makes it so you can draw it sometimes but almost never in multiples. You can always search it if you know you can resolve it.  <span>No Crossout Designator</span>: I don't really think Crossout Designator is worth it in this deck. Crossout is really amazing when it is imperative that your combo go through, but is eh when you have cards to fall back on (like the Eldlich cards). I would rather have more extenders or Eldlich cards than draw a Crossout because Crossout is really a brick if you draw it at the wrong time or if you draw multiples. Granted, the Mayakashi half will lost to Nibiru every so often because there are no Crossout's to protect them, but if that happens you'll usually have the Eldlich cards to fall back on. Also, you'll usually be going hand neutral with your opponent's Nibiru if you've only used Hajun from the hand for your Mayakashi combo, which really isn't too bad.  &nbsp;  I really love Mayakashi and want to make this deck the best it can be. Any and all comments/critiques are appreciated, though I may take a while to respond."

The OTK is simple <ol>  	<li>Kaiju your opponent's monster</li>  	<li>Summon your tokens (Hippo Carnival spells)</li>  	<li>Leeching the Light (can be cast multiple times!)</li>  	<li>Attack with everything</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Other combos <ul>  	<li>Kaiju into Kaiju. Normal summon Neo Spacian Mole and bounce enemy's Kaiju back into your hand. Can be repeated every turn if your opponent doesn't can't deal with Mole.</li>  	<li>Try to bait out MSTs throughout the game by setting Waboku, Draw Muscle and Jar of greed. Set Tenyi the turn before you drop the combo.</li>  	<li>Angmarl the monarch can be summoned using your battle fader, performapal hip hippo or anchafroumite to search for whatever spell you need, usually Defence Muscle for draw. Leeching - Angmarl - 2nd Leeching if you want to commit hard.</li>  	<li>Summon anchafroumite BEFORE hippo tokens to get a 6th monster (extra monster zone) to swing with during your Leeching the Light turn</li>  	<li>Token Sundae is good to clear your board of tokens when it's clogged, while also removing enemy's backrow and battle immune or defence position monsters</li> </ul> The rest of the deck exists just to stall and draw for combo pieces. You probably want to go 2nd because cardcar d is your only turn 1 play.  Most games you can stall long enough to see 2x Leeching the Light and Delg the 3rd. But if you use up all your leechings (max combo 3 times) you probably lose. This deck gets countered pretty hard by itself (cards like battle fader, waboku, etc.)  Hippo tokens can wall off the opponent in a pinch but don't count on it. Piercing damage will hurt a lot. Use them for Defence Muscle draw and Token Sundae instead.  Use Waboku and Battle Fader to stall.  &nbsp;"

Now, it's actually really good. Even at 60 cards >:)","Okay, so I'm back with a revision to this chimera of a deck I made after I failed to read Adamancipator Analyzer's effect properly thinking it would work on Megalith. However, when I realized it didn't work I did however realize that they synergized well and after that went full-blown mad scientist and added in a Thunder Dragon engine and the deck worked well enough that I decided to stick to the idea and improve upon it.  If you want you can see the original deck here: https://ygoprodeck.com/adamancipator-megalith-thunder-dragon-no-this-isnt-a-joke/  So first I feel like I should explain the changes I made and why I made them.  C1: Ratio changes.  I have changed the ratios for the deck greatly to improve general consistency. Now the Adamancipator and Thunder Dragon decks are the core parts while the Megalith part is more included for some spicy plays like Numeron Dragon. I upped the previous thunder dragon package to a full engine to ensure I get Colossus more often and can set up Titan as well. I improved the Adamancipator Package by adding Guardian, I had to take out Leonite to account for the second Titan because I encountered a situation where I desperately needed it a few times. I also upped the Researcher to 3 but that was just to improve the deck slightly. I completely removed Friends because it really didn't matter. I removed the Impcantations because they did little to improve the deck and often ended up clogging the board which hurt the deck greatly. I changed around a few other cards and if you want to compare them you can check out the original list.  C2: Strategy changes.  Really the biggest change is that Thunder Dragon does the most legwork for the deck and the Adamancipator portion can get you some time to set up Thunder Dragon, or just win the game by itself in some cases. I added Verte to improve the Thunder Dragon portion and it has been a lifesaver on a few occasions. Other than that nothing has really changed since if the Megalith stuff happens the deck can really pop off, but even if it doesn't happen the deck can end up wild. In one case by turn 3 I tested how far I could go and ended on a Titan, Colossus, Access code, Borrel, Draglubion, and Numeron Dragon. Really the Numeron Dragon was just for fun but it was probably the single most explosive turn I had although if I played the deck better it could probably go higher.  C3: Changes in weaknesses.  These really haven't changed other than cards like macro or Dimensional fissure actually help the Thunder Dragon part greatly, you still get hosed pretty hard by skill drain if it gets set up for too long. Really, if I could add in some back row removal I would love to, if anyone has suggestions for a card to replace please tell me, I would love to know. My best guess would be to remove the Preparations and the Called by and put in 3 twin twister since it would help the Thunder Dragon portion with its discard effects. Ash blossom of course hurts but it can be managed.  C4: Changes against meta.  I'd say the only meta deck that counters the deck heavily is Eldlich but that's just because of the floodgates mostly. I haven't seen any Drytron yet and if an opponent had it they might have surrendered before I could find out. Chances are it's because I haven't hit Platinum yet but I'm close. I really just haven't had the time to play. Work and other obligations have gotten in the way. But I'll try and if I get there I will come back to update this portion."

Also, so long as a deck gives me an excuse to play <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a>, I will do it, since it's my favorite Pendulum Monster.</span>  <strong><span>The Main Deck:</span></strong>  <span>Might as well call it ""WIND Spellcaster, the deck"" because you'll be reading that a lot.</span>  <span><strong>• The Majespecters (x3 <a data-name=""Majespecter Fox - Kyubi"">Kyubi</a>, <a data-name=""Majespecter Toad - Ogama"">Ogama</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Majespecter Cat - Nekomata"">Nekomata</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Majespecter Crow - Yata"">Yata</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Bunbuku</a>)</strong> - Well... we can't really play a Majespecter list without Majespecter cards, so... self explanatory. They're all WIND Spellcaster Pendulum Monsters with Pendulum Scales of 2 and 5 that surprisingly does not have any Pendulum effect, and does something when Normal or Special Summoned, which are the following:</span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Fox - Kyubi"">Kyubi</a> searches a Majespecter Trap.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Toad - Ogama"">Ogama</a> sets a Majespecter Spell/Trap directly from your Deck.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Cat - Nekomata"">Nekomata</a> searches a Majespecter card.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Crow - Yata"">Yata</a> searches a Majespecter Spell.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku"">Bunbuku</a> searches a Majespecter monster.</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a></strong> - <span>He's a 2100 ATK beater, that is a WIND Spellcaster, which is relevant for the purposes of both our Majespecter cards and Xyz Summoning. We could also always retrieve him with <a data-name=""Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess"">Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess</a> anyway, which is one of our primary defenders. His effect isn't as relevant since we're not really playing other Pendulum Magicians, which most of them are all at high rarity and there's not a lot of good pay off for them anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a></strong> - <span>Our only Tuner, because she's the only good low Level WIND Spellcaster Tuner at N/R rarity, and she's Level 1, so it shouldn't be hard to Synchro Summon with her.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a></strong> - <span>Our <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, and we can only play it at 1 because Konami limited it for this format lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Majesty's Pegasus"">Majesty's Pegasus</a></strong> - <span>The archetypal Field Spell, non-searchable so play it at 3. Gives your Majespecters boost in ATK and DEF for added pressure because, they're honestly pretty frail. It also allows you to Tribute ANY WIND Spellcaster to Special Summon a Majespecter monster from the Deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Majespecter Spells (x3 <a data-name=""Majespecter Storm"">Storm</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Majespecter Cyclone"">Cyclone</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Majespecter Sonics"">Sonics</a>)</strong> - <span>We only play a few of these because this is still a Pendulum deck at the end of the day and we'd much rather search it through the effects of our Majespecter, except for Storm which is always nice to have. Don't worry, there are no <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in this format, so hurrah. Their effects are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Storm"">Storm</a> tributes a WIND Spellcaster monster to target a monster your opponent controls and shuffles it to the Deck.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Cyclone"">Cyclone</a> tributes a WIND Spellcaster monster to target a monster your opponent controls and destroys it.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Sonics"">Sonics</a> is an archetypal <a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a> but halves the damage it deals.</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• The Majespecter Traps (x3 <a data-name=""Majespecter Tempest"">Tempest</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Majespecter Tornado"">Tornado</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Majespecter Supercell"">Supercell</a>)</strong> - <span>This we could afford to play fewer of, except for Tempest which is a counter trap, because we have more access to Trap searchers than Spells. Their effects are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Tempest"">Tempest</a> is an archetypal Solemn Strike at a cost of only tributing a WIND Spellcaster monster, which is great in a low rarity format like this.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Tornado"">Tornado</a> tributes a WIND Spellcaster monster to target a monster your opponent controls and banish it.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Majespecter Supercell"">Supercell</a> is a Continuous Trap that makes it so that while you have a Majespecter card in your Pendulum Zone, the activation and effects of your other Majespecter cards cannot be negated. It also allows you to recycle Majespecter cards (including itself) in your GY and draws you a card. Currently debating playing more of this for insurance.</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Igknight Reload"">Igknight Reload</a></strong> - <span>Consistency piece.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Synchro monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2300 ATK Level 4 WIND Synchro monster that's is a <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> when sent to the GY as a monster, and a permanent <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a> when removed while equipped to a monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2200 ATK Level 5 WIND Synchro monster, who is only relevant because she's a WIND, and that means she gets the protection that <a data-name=""Windwitch - Snow Bell"">Windwitch - Snow Bell</a> bestows when used as a Synchro Material for a WIND Synchro monster. You could play <a data-name=""Crystron Ametrix"">Crystron Ametrix</a> if you want a 2500 ATK beater instead, which is also neat because she switches all Special Summoned monsters your opponent controls to Defense Position upon her Synchro Summon.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Kendama"">Hi-Speedroid Kendama</a></strong> - <span>Another generic 2200 ATK Level 6 WIND Synchro monster that deals piercing damage and can revive itself on corner cases.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a></strong> or <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Zeta"">Psy-Framelord Zeta </a>- <span>A generic Level 7 Synchro monster that is a Battle Phase floodgate for monsters. It can also Special Summon 1 monster from your Pendulum Scale for the purposes of your Majespecter Spells/Traps. Zeta is just another generic Level 7 Synchro monster that can get rid of any of your opponent's Special Summoned monsters by banishing the two of them until your next Standby Phase, although requiring that monster to be in face-up Attack Position. Good against Xyz monsters.</span></span>  <span><b>• <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a> </b>- <span>Your main focus is not summoning this card as fast as you can, but if you can make this card, at least you have it when you need it, because it makes OTKing easier in a deck as slow as Majespecters.</span></span>  <span><strong>Xyz monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 25: Force Focus"">Number 25: Force Focus</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 6 monster with a Quick Effect targeting negation on any of your opponent's Level 5 or higher effect monsters. Also a good body at 2800 ATK and 2400 DEF. The only good Rank 6 option besides <a data-name=""Sword Breaker"">Sword Breaker</a>, which is a budget <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> for mono-type decks.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Firewall eXceed Dragon"">Firewall eXceed Dragon</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 4 beatstick, which is only here because we're playing Link 3 monsters, so we can pump it up to 4000 ATK.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board, which is neat because Majespecters do allow you to Pendulum Summon Level 4 monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 82: Heartlandraco"">Number 82: Heartlandraco</a></strong> - <span>A generic Rank 4 beater that gains a protection against battle, provided that you have a face-up Spell, and we're playing Pendulums and their Field Spell, so yeah. It can also attack directly by detaching an Xyz material.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess"">Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess</a></strong> - <span>A Rank 4 EARTH Rock Xyz monster that requires Spellcasters as Xyz material, in which we have plenty of, with an effect to detach an Xyz material to add a Level 5 or higher Spellcaster monster in your GY to your hand, which is why we can play <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a>. We can't really make full use of both its equip effects, being a Spell/Trap destruction and allowing a monster equipped with her to attack twice because we're not playing any enablers for it, but she's fine as a 2400 DEF blocker.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>A 2600 DEF body on board that has an interruption in the form of a replacement effect in response to an opponent's monster effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a></strong> - <span>It's a small towers monster, that can recycle itself and 2 of your Level 3 Majespecters in the GY upon getting sent there from the field.</span></span>  <span><strong>Link monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle"">Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle</a></strong> - <span>A Link 3 monster that requires 2+ WIND monsters, which we play plenty of. It's our main beatstick for the deck, which also happens to have good Link arrows for the purposes of Pendulum Summoning. Also messes up your opponent's GY set up.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a></strong> - <span>A generic Link 2 WIND Insect monster that's only here for the purposes of Link climbing.</span></span>  <strong><span>Additional notes and final thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>I'm not gonna lie, I've had a little bit of choice paralysis when it comes to building this deck but before everything else, free Kirin already Konami, I'm serious, this deck has a lot of versatile control tools, but lacks offensive pressure. This deck is so reliant on the Extra Deck and maintaining tempo to gain advantage, it's not even funny, but once you're able to pick up and keep it up, you'll most likely be fine because that's just the nature of control decks in general. I'm not really the type of person who are big on decks like this, so I'm sure anyone could pilot this more efficiently than me, but if I were to describe it, it's almost similar to playing Altergeists and even Salamangreats to an extent. You don't win by overwhelming your opponent, you win by burning their resources out, and in a slower format like this where only N/R rarity cards are legal, I think it's a pretty strong contender. Also, you could choose to play this deck at full control, by cutting out the Tuner and and other consistency pieces that you're comfortable not playing with and using Counter Traps or chainable Traps instead, but I think this deck already got more than enough back row to deal with your opponent's monsters mainly, so if I were to do it, I'd probably splash in some <a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a>, <a data-name=""Dust Tornado"">Dust Tornado</a> or <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon </a>to deal with back row, <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a>, <a data-name=""Pulling the Rug"">Pulling the Rug</a>, or <a data-name=""Forced Back"">Forced Back</a>. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

With an Egyptian twist! With generic rock support, a powerful midrange deck that turbos out Extra Deck monsters is made possible. A deck ","A deck specifically made for Master Duel's N/R Rarity Event.  Rock spam... With an Egyptian twist! Most of the rock support that had been racking up the last couple years have been largely untouched in the N/R event, and it comes together here in Triamid Adamancipator.  Triamid is a solid rock archetype that also has strong recursion and removal in the form of their field spells. In particular, Triamid Pulse does EVERYTHING for rock types: spot destruction, reviving a rock from the GY, and GY recycling of fieldspells with +1 draw! Triamid Loading makes every rock type monster float into a Triamid monster, and as an added bonus, searches out any Triamid S/T.  Just like in the usual Adamancipator strategies, the archetype is splashed into rock archetypes (in this case, Triamid) for easy access to bigger Extra Deck monsters and enhanced consistency.  Miracle Rupture has four targets in the deck to send to the GY and they each provide beneficial effects:  1. Nemeses Keystone (banish fodder for Gigantes, free summon and recycles banished monsters), 2. Tackle Crusader (Book of the Moon/Bounce S/T), 3. Revival Golem (Free body on board), and 4. Sentry Soldier of Stone (Free body on board).  With Adamancipator and Triamid working together coupled with generic rock support, a powerful midrange deck that turbos out Extra Deck monsters is made possible.

ZEXAL. Anyway, here I am presenting you one of the most cheesy beatdown deck in existence, Dark Mist turbo.</span>  <span>Why play this deck?</span>  <span>Well, the main goal of this deck is to bring out either <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Number 96: Dark Mist</a> or <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Number C96: Dark Storm</a>, and I'd say it's pretty fun, and you got access to one of the strongest Rank-Up-Magic spells in the game which surprisingly is just a R rarity, <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force</a>, which is a <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or more precisely <a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">Kali Yuga</a> except just for any face-up cards, especially in a format where Metalfoes will be everywhere.</span>  <strong><span>The Main Deck:</span></strong>  <span><strong>• The kitchen utensils (<a data-name=""Malicevorous Knife"">Knife</a>, <a data-name=""Malicevorous Fork"">Fork</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Malicevorous Spoon"">Spoon</a>)</strong> - <span>Number 96's archetypal monsters, the Malicevorous. Have three of them in grip and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a>. Have three of them and a Rank-Up-Magic and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Dark Storm</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Live Twins (<a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil"">Ki-sikil</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la"">Lil-la</a>)</strong> - <span>Either of them is a guaranteed two Level 2 bodies on board. Have either of them and a <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a> in hand and you have a guaranteed <a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a></strong> - <span>A free body, provided that you have at least 1 DARK monster, but can only Special Summon itself once per turn this way.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a></strong> - <span>Your crustiest Normal Summon. It's a Level 2 DARK Tuner, so I guess it works with <a data-name=""Caligo Claw Crow"">Caligo Claw Crow</a>. Gives you room to play Synchros, however much it matters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Giant Germ"">Giant Germ</a></strong> - <span>Your floater. The worst thing you could do in a turn is to set this card and pass.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Rank-Up Spells (x3 <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force"">Numeron Force</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force"">Limited Barian's Force</a>)</strong> - <span>They're Rank-Up spells, the only one that we have access to that are generic, in fact. Limited Barian's Force is just your bare bones Rank-Up spell while Numeron Force, as for the reasons I have stated previously, is the best going second against an established board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psychic Blade"">Psychic Blade</a></strong> - <span>More Damage. You could also use <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a> instead, I guess.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - <span>Back row removal for coverage.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> </strong>- <span>Good against monsters with problematic effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dark Illusion"">Dark Illusion</a></strong> - <span>Greatest protection that we have access to, since most of our boss monsters are all DARK, and it's a Counter Trap, and we need to play as many protection as we can get since our boss monsters are pretty frail outside combat.</span></span>  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  <strong><span>Xyz monsters</span></strong>  <span><strong>• Number 96 (<a data-name=""Number 96: Dark Mist"">Dark Mist</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Number C96: Dark Storm"">Dark Storm</a>)</strong> - <span>Our main boss monsters. Although very fragile against card effects, I haven't seen anything in the N/R format that can trump this card in combat. Dark Storm is a bit sturdier, since it has an added protection of battle protection.</span></span>  <span><strong>• Number 65 (<a data-name=""Number 65: Djinn Buster"">Djinn Buster</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Number C65: King Overfiend"">King Overfiend</a>)</strong> - <span>Our second boss monsters. Djinn Buster has a quick play monster effect negation that also burns your opponent, while King Overfiend is a one-sided <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. That itself should speak volumes to this card's power in an extremely limited format like this.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a></strong> - <span>He is a walking <a data-name=""Prohibition"">Prohibition</a> or <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> against any of your opponent's face-up card, provided that he himself also stays face-up on the field. He's also pretty tough, having a 2200 ATK body.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Number 43: Manipulator of Souls"">Number 43: Manipulator of Souls</a></strong> - <span>If all else fails, and we need to stall, we could always summon this card that is indestructible by battle or card effects, provided that we equip a ""Number"" card to it by its effect, in which we will most likely do since all Xyz monsters that we have are ""Number"" monsters.</span></span>  <strong><span>Synchro monsters</span></strong>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2300 ATK Level 4 WIND Synchro monster that's is a <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> when sent to the GY as a monster, and a permanent <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a> when removed while equipped to a monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Underworld Fighter Balmung"">Underworld Fighter Balmung</a></strong> - <span>A generic 2100 ATK Level 4 DARK Synchro monster that replaces itself upon getting destroyed by a card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Crystron Quandax"">Crystron Quandax</a></strong> - <span>A generic Level 4 Synchro Tuner monster, whose purpose is only to Synchro climb with <a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a> into <a data-name=""Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon"">Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon</a> in which if it wasn't obvious enough, clearly cope, but since we don't have anything else better to do anyway, why not?</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a></strong> - <span>A decent generic 2500 ATK Level 6 Synchro monster that mills the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck upon dealing battle damage.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon"">Stardust Chronicle Spark Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Summon this if you want/can, but don't focus on it. It's just here because of big number and because you could make it when the situation allows you.</span></span>  <strong><span>Honorable mentions</span></strong>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Cherry Inmato"">Cherry Inmato</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Plant Tuner that floats upon getting destroyed by battle.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Krebons"">Krebons</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Psychic Tuner that can just sit on the field and avoid battle destruction by paying 800 LP to negate an attack directed towards it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""T.G. Metal Skeleton"">T.G. Metal Skeleton</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Zombie monster just here because it can Special Summon itself after a monster (in your possession, most likely) is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Blackwing - Gust the Backblast"">Blackwing - Gust the Backblast</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Winged Beast monster that can Special Summon itself if you control no other cards.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Dark Rose Fairy"">Dark Rose Fairy</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Fairy monster that can Special Summon itself from your hand if a Tuner monster(s) is Special Summoned, and can recycle itself by sending a card from your hand to the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Doppelwarrior"">Doppelwarrior</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from your hand if a monster(s) is Special Summoned from your GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Spear Cretin"">Spear Cretin</a></strong> - <span>A Level 2 DARK Fiend monster that can set up an annoying battle phase loop where having access to at least 2 of these and 1 of them being in the GY is full ""combo"". After getting flipped, use its effect to Special Summon another Spear Cretin from your GY in face-down Defense Position. Its effect is not once per turn.</span></span>  <span>Final thoughts</span>  <span>I don't expect this to be a ""top tier"" deck, since it's not really the most versatile deck available for the N/R format, but I can see a potential with this deck alongside possibly having access to more control tools instead, and considering the other tools at its disposal. I'm definitely going to be testing more of this throughout the event, since there's a lot of other good extenders and/or starters that are rarity locked, like <a data-name=""Ret-time Reviver Emit-ter"">Ret-time Reviver Emit-ter</a>. Overall, it is a one trick pony deck that aims to abuse a very powerful Rank-Up spell and punish your opponent for unnecessarily overextending. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Not much lot else to say about the deck, especially if you've been playing this game for a long time, by now you should know how annoying Fairy monsters are. Yes, this deck plays slow but who cares if your opponent is unable to play at all.</span>  <span><strong>The main deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>The Fairies</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a></strong> - <span>Yes, this card is only a R rarity. If you've played or against Drytrons, yeah... you already know. It's your main monster negate, and you can recycle it with <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">The Sanctum of Parshath</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Bountiful Artemis"">Bountiful Artemis</a></strong> - <span>Your main source of draw power. It's not once per turn, it's not once per copy of the card, it's one draw per Bountiful Artemis, each time you activate a Counter Trap.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Meltiel, Sage of the Sky"">Meltiel, Sage of the Sky</a></strong> - <span>Your way of gaining LP, and interruption in the form of non-targeting destruction, provided that ""<a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a>"" or <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">The Sanctum of Parshath</a> is on the field, since the latter counts as the former.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a></strong> - <span>The main reason why you're still alive, even after activating all that Counter Traps, although we're not really using Counter Traps that pay LP for cost, so the only thing this card will mitigate is the discard cost to maintain card advantage.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Minerva, Scholar of the Sky"">Minerva, Scholar of the Sky</a></strong> - <span>Your main beat stick, and recycler, provided that ""The Sanctuary in the Sky"" or The Sanctum of Parshath is on the field.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a></strong> - <span>Normal Summon Condemned Witch, add <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">The Sanctum of Parshath</a></strong> - <span>One of your most important cards. It protects your Set Spells/Traps from targeting and destruction, it recycles your Fairies and Counter Trap cards from your GY and stacks them to your Deck, and it counts as ""<a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a>"" for the purposes of our monsters' effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - Back row removal for coverage.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a></strong> - Walmart <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Imperm</a>, except it can be activated during the Damage Step.</span>  <span><strong>The Counter Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Seven Tools of the Bandit"">Seven Tools of the Bandit</a></strong> - <span>Trap negate at a cost of paying 1000 LP.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a></strong> - <span>Spell negate that forces your opponent to -1 just to negate this.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a></strong> - <span>Spell negate for the rest of the Duel at a cost of discarding a Spell specifically, that's why we can afford to play <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Chalices</a> and <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">MST</a>s for fodder.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Forced Back"">Forced Back</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Normal Summon and waste it by returning it to the hand. Not good in terms of card advantage but good in terms of ramping up tempo.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Special Summons (that does not start a Chain) and destroy that monster for no cost.</span></span>  <span><strong>The side deck:</strong></span>  <span>Yes, no Extra Deck, because the available Fairy tuners suck so... yeah. Anyway.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Aurora Paragon"">Aurora Paragon</a></strong> - <span>YEP floodgate. You can afford to just set monsters anyway so it's not much of a big deal for you, plus you can recycle it with <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">Sanctum</a>, so that's that.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Chaos Trap Hole"">Chaos Trap Hole</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Special Summon of LIGHT or DARK monster(s) and banish them at a cost of 2000 LP. Works well with <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""The Selection"">The Selection</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate your opponent's Summon of a monster, provided that it shares a type with a monster that is already on the field. Strong consideration since mono-type decks will be the go-to strategy in this format.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Pulling the Rug"">Pulling the Rug</a></strong> - <span>A way to negate both of your opponent's monster's activation and effect that is activated upon a monster's Normal Summon and destroy that monster for no cost.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Divine Wrath"">Divine Wrath</a></strong> - <span>Monster negate at a cost of discarding a card.</span></span>  <span>Final thoughts</span>  <span>I mean... it's Counter Fairies. Everyone who plays this game pretty much already knows what the strategy wants to do, or what it wants you not to do. It's a heavily reactive resource management based deck that always wants to go first to be able to set up plays, pretty much loses to massive consecutive board wipes, has weak recovery against faster decks, but in a slow format like N/R rarity only, I think it's got a good shot at finding success. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

All of the ""Edge Imps"" possess helpful abilities on their own, such as ""<a title=""Edge Imp Chain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>"" searching your ""Frightfur"" Spell and Trap support whenever it hits the Graveyard, ""<a title=""Edge Imp Saw"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Saw"">Edge Imp Saw</a>"" providing extra draw power, and ""<a title=""Edge Imp Tomahawk"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_Imp_Tomahawk"">Edge Imp Tomahawk</a>"" being able to substitute for any of the other ""Edge Imp"" monsters should they not be available in the hand or field.  The Deck responds badly to too many out-of-archetype cards, as they cannot be fused with, and the other Summoning methods are not nearly as important as your Fusion Summoning. However, Fluffals can potentially be merged with archetypes such as <a title=""Gem-Knight"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gem-Knight"">Gem-Knights</a>, <a title=""Shaddoll"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shaddoll"">Shaddolls</a>, or <a title=""Invoked"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Invoked"">Invoked</a>.

Right now in this deck with both Adventurer engine and DPE engine there are more than 2 openings in this deck. It can go from Infinity and 1 handtrap to ABC+DPE+Masquerena with it's openings. Currently for this deck I made there are around 5 openings which is alredy a big plus for this deck that lost so much from getting his best combo card, Union Carrier, banned. You can start from classical Union Hangar opening or Galaxy Soldier opening to a brand new Adventurer opening. You can also open with DPE or with Gadget+Destrudo opening. Those alone can solidly for a rogue deck alone, but if openings are combined together, they can go against meta decks like Virtual World or D/D or Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika (ok the last one is bad to be honest but it is still played a lot online so I consider it a kind of meta deck). If you think that there are any better options for this deck, every idea is welcome."

Me neither.,"This deck is very simple. Tribute on opponents monster for a kaiju, and summon one of your own if you have it in your hand. then use a Mysterune spell to summon a Mysterune fusion monster. Attack the kaiju with the fusion monster to take 3000 damage to activate inferno tempest. Unless your opponent is playing Sky Striker or Eldlich, Inferno tempest should banish most of their deck, and since 3 Necroface have been banished, both players banish an additional 15 cards. Then finally finish mulling your opponent with your other Mysterune quick play spells and Hand Destruction. Called by the grave was added in incase your opponent tries to use hand traps on your draw cards. This decks big weakness is its hard to draw inferno tempest, and this deck is second going, so if you go first you just have to pray you can stay alive for a turn. Also Secret village of the spellcasters completely shuts this deck down. At the end of the day, this has been the best Inferno Tempest mull deck I've played, hope you enjoy!  <strong>EDIT:</strong> Oh! Don't forget, Mysterune spells skip your next battle phase, meaning you have to summon your Mysterune fusion monster during your battle phase and NOT your main phase, otherwise you can't attack and the combo is ruined."

Basically summoning beat sticks and shattering your enemy. Only thing is that you need to rely on ""Malefic World"" for most matches. Nonetheless ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" is a life-saver for this deck as well as ""Malefic Divide"" since you'll be discarding and banishing monsters quite a lot. I believe it's quite a risky deck but def worth the fun and truly powerful when you learn how to play with it. Also, I believe that two ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" might not be enough, as well as the one ""Malefic Divide"", so maybe adding an additional copy would make it better or perhaps add a ""Monster Reborn"" or smth.  The cards on the side deck are alternatives for some of the cards in the deck. ""Effect Veiler"" can replace ""Skill Drain"", and the extra ""Malefic Paradox Dragon"" can replace ""Baronne De Fleur"". Unfortunately, I can't think of any other replacements for the rest of the deck, in case some might be too expensive."

Fun deck to keep up with the Meta in Master Duel","If you're looking for a deck to help battle the meta slaves, this might be the one. Aside from the huge upfront cost to build this deck, it is super fun and sets up unbeatable boards like those at the top of the tier list.  There are no single line plays for this deck so it can take a while to get familiar with it but the general gist of how to play it goes something like this.  Step 1: Get two pendulum monsters on the board.  Step 1.5: If you can complete step one while having an additional Mythical Beast Jackal King, you're gonna have a good time. This will stop many hand traps from ruining the rest of your combo.  Step 2: Link Electrumite and put Astrograph Sorcerer into your extra deck  Step 3: Pop a pendulum spell with Electrumite and return Astrograph to your hand, special summon him, add one card to your hand and draw a card.

Step 6: From this point there are a few way to go, a lot of time time your board will be stacked enough to just end, but sometimes you need to flex more so go into Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon and pop him with a Mighty Master or if you have enough material on the board, use Vortex Dragon and another card to go into Masquerena to go into Apollousa next turn for more negate.

This is my attempt at casting the Invader of Darkness as a viable boss monster within a worthy deck, focusing on graveyard revival strategies, Squires and Dark Spirit cards for his consistent summoning and shutdown of quick-play spells (Chalice, MST, E. Teleport, B. of Moon, Super Poly, Cyclone, Controller, Twisters, etc). Depending on the match-up, Vanity's Fiend and Lair of Darkness can further shut down your opponent's ability to summon monsters and defend against the Invader!  I enjoy Allure and Upstart as draw cards that help prevent bricking, along with the first effect of Dark Spirit's Mastery as the primary search card for the Invader of Darkness (IOD). Usually, hard-drawing IOD isn't absolutely terrible: seeing him <strong>or</strong> Mastery in your opening hand, with Edea <strong>or</strong> Reinforcement, will bring out Invader of Darkness on your first turn. Play Mastery (If you don't have IOD in hand) to Discard 1 &gt; Search &amp; Add IOD &gt; Normal summon Edea (or use Reinforcement to search Edea first) &gt; Special summon Eidos &gt; Use Eidos' effect to tribute both Squires to Tribute summon IOD. If you hard draw IOD <strong>and</strong> Mastery: Play Mastery &gt; Discard IOD &gt; add another IOD from your deck. (IOD is decent in the GY if you control a Dark Spirit monster). If you don't have / aren't able to get IOD to hand while controlling the Squires, Extra Deck plays can save you (thinking Phoenix / Unicorn). You can rebuild a board the turn after Tribute or Link summoning away the Squires: Banish Eidos from GY &gt; Special summon Edea from GY &gt; Special summon Eidos (from deck). The Squires' special summoning effects thrive when they're in the GY together.  I've tried Double Coston and Doomdog in the deck for reliable tribute summoning and searching for IOD, but think the Squires' ability to re-build a board (after being sent from Tribute / Link summoning or your own board wipe with Torrential Tribute), in <strong>addition</strong> to making tribute summoning easier in general is just too good for me to pass them up. The downsides are that their stats are terrible, Edea is a LIGHT type, and you need 3x of each to fuel the Squire engine but you do NOT want to hard-draw into Eidos; he is only useful in your deck, graveyard or on the field. (That's where Allure can help, along with cards like Mastery and Reincarnation that allow you to discard 1). If anyone has better ideas for low-level monsters, please share - I'm not currently incorporating Tuners / Synchros though I understand there's great DARK support in the Synchro world (Thinking Beelze).  GY revival strategies (however cheap they are), also work in summoning IOD quickly; Foolish Burial can send IOD while Reborn or Call of the Haunted can special summon him. By quick-effect, either Dark Spirit monster card can trade places with IOD in the GY. Foolish and a Malice in your opening hand, for example, means IOD will make an appearance on your field within a turn: Play Foolish &gt; Send IOD to GY &gt; Normal summon Malice &gt; (set traps) &gt; pass turn &gt; Swap Malice for IOD (quick-effect) when your opponent does basically anything. (IOD loses his effect when summoned by a Dark Spirit, simply becoming a 2900 beatstick / eventual XYZ material, so this is not the primary strategy).  Vanity's Fiend is my current back-up boss monster for this deck, with his timing being crucial and summoning being conditional (a level 6, not searchable, can't be special summoned, etc). Ha Des and Neosphere are alternative back-up bosses in the side deck. Dark Necrofear could also work well (being a level 8 and searchable by Mastery, summonable with the Dark Spirits). In the extra deck, Zombiestien, Lancelot, Zombie Vamp and Queen of the Night can step in when the IOD isn't cutting it. Zombiestein is a beatstick with a single negate at the cost of detaching one and switching him to defense (DEF/1000). Lancelot can attack directly, pop one monster <strong>and </strong>negate one spell/trap. Queen of the Night requires 3x Level 8's so she hardly ever comes out, but two of her effects are useful: detach 1 to negate 1, or detach one to give a little attack boost to another monster. Thanatos (Rank-4) is great if Armageddon and Grepher are on the field and I want to make a heavy-hitter that becomes immune to card effect (quick-effect) by detaching 1. Break Sword is a great Rank-3 if you end up drawing several Dark Spirits, with his ability to destroy 2 cards (one of your own, one of your opponent's).  Lair of Darkness can really shut down some decks' engines if they are attribute-specific, so my side deck runs 3x copies. It doesn't do much against certain decks, sort of like Zombie World, which has a similar effect and is usually only sided-in for specific match-ups. Torrential Tribute can devastate your opponent and leave you relatively unharmed if you control the Squires. Once banished from you GY, Eidos will special summon Edea from the GY, who can special summon another Eidos from the Deck, allowing for a very easy Tribute summon of IOD (if he's in your hand), all while your opponent's board has been wiped. If you had Call in your back row when you activated Torrential, and you destroyed an IOD on your field, you can bring him back out through Call's revival.  If there are any suggestions, please let me know - thanks!"

The idea was a super-pure combo deck that uses Cherubini to send a Shaddoll, Rusty to help set-up Requiems into Isolde to access Dark Law into Verte for Magicalized Fusion to make Winda. The combo actually works pretty well when you see Tour Guide or enough Extenders, but doesn't really leave room to play interaction, which makes siding hell and going second pretty rough. Still, I love this type of extended combo, I love putting up weird boards, and I wanted to manifest that in this deck.  This is take 2. Accesscode is decent for breaking boards and OTKing, but in the backrow matchup I really want Unchained Abomination. Cicada King is only an on-field monster negate, and truly wasn't worth making nearly as often as I thought, so I popped in Tornado Dragon. This gives me some sort of plan against Trap decks. To help the situation going second, I added some interactive cards - TTT isn't really great going second right now, but it certainly isn't bad, and it helps the deck play through hand traps and gather information going first, so it's lower risk than some other options. Imperm always seems sweet, but here a bluff is extra value. I don't think Droplets is that good in this deck going first, it is a very very card hungry deck, so these are mostly just discard fodder, but going second these can help break those unbreakable boards, and for amazing value. This makes siding less miserable, going second at least possible, and rounds things out in Trap matchups, but also makes the inconsistency problems the deck has worse, since you won't be seeing that broken starter (Tour Guide) as often. Still, being able to actually play Yu-Gi-Oh is nice, and reducing the brickiness of the deck is also nice.  It became a problem not to run 2 Dark Rank 4 Xyz for the Break Sword combos, so I cut Abyss Dweller, which was redundant with Dark Law anyways, and added Time Thief Redoer. Because you can often make a Rank 4 with a Trap and a Monster, Redoer seems like the best bet - there are a couple on-field negates, a versatile Book of Moon or two, and a couple very specific ways to negate summons, and not a lot else interesting in terms of Dark Ranks 4s, and Redoer does a half-decent Tornado Dragon impression while maybe sneaking extra value vs Spell heavy decks. I cut down interruption cards - while it is important to have some, the deck also already had some consistency issues, and the interruption suite made them a lot worse, so I'm trying to do damage control without giving up on going second."

This is what I came up ultimately. This is a hyper aggressive combo deck, that's why we play 31 monsters. Trust me, if you get into your combo, this deck is almost unstoppable. Unfortunately the original Red Dragon Archfiend, Red Nova Dragon and Hot Red Dragon Archfiend are no longer good anymore. The next best level 8 synchro monster is Chaos Ruler, that's why I play two copies. Supernova outpowers Red Nova in every sight, I replaced that one. I don't play Burning Soul, because you need to have combo to make this card live and if you want to make King Calamity in your opponents turn, it misses timing if you want to add a card from your graveyard. Don't get me wrong you still can play this card, but I would recommend not to. I choose Effect Veiler over Imperm, because it's a light tuner monster which comes in clutch for Supernova and Chaos Ruler.  Combo 1: Crimson Resonator + Wandering King Wildwind <ol>  	<li>Specialsummon Crimson, since you control no monsters</li>  	<li>Specialsummon Wildwind, since you control a fiend-type monster with 1500 atk or less</li>  	<li>Go into Red Rising and use its effect to bring back Crimson</li>  	<li>Effect Crimson, since you control only crimson and one dark-dragon-synchro monster</li>  	<li>Specialsummon one Creation Resonator and one Synkron Resonator</li>  	<li>Go into Supernova using Crimson, Creation, Synkron and Red rising</li>  	<li> Effect Synkron, add back Crimson to your hand</li>  	<li>Congratulations, you haven't even normalsummoned</li> </ol> Combo 2: Crimson Resonator + Ascator, the Dawnwalker <ol>  	<li>Specialsummon Crimson</li>  	<li>Effect Ascator, discard one, specialsummon Ascator from your hand and the fire ant from your deck</li>  	<li>Use fire ant and Ascator to go into Chaos Ruler</li>  	<li>Chaos Ruler effect: (You wanna see Synkron, Handtraps, Wildwind, Red Reign, Red Familiar etc.)</li>  	<li>Crimson effect: specialsummon one Chain Resonator and one Synkron from your deck (or two Synkron, depends)</li>  	<li>Go into Supernova using everything</li>  	<li>Effect Synkron, bounce back one Resonator you need</li> </ol> This is only the tip of the iceberg, there are way more combos.

Preferably go for White Wing Magician and Purple Poison Magician so that you can summon Timestar Magician, or an alternative is Harmonizing Magician. What we are going for here is trying to maximize our way to get Z-ARC out right now, Timestar being summon after using Pendulum Call will basically mean it and your other ""Magician"" monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects until your opponents end phase. With Timestar out you can also send the materials you need to grave using it's effect if the opponent attempts to destroy your pendulum scales, so if you have Double Iris and Black Fang already send White Wing and Purple Poison and vice versa. Then next turn search out Astrograph/Chronograph and bring out Z-ARC, united we stand is in there so that you can equip it onto Z-ARC so he can't be destroyed in battle unless they destroy the equip spell or they gain Z-ARC's attack points, United We Stand gives Z-ARC an extra 800 points per face up monster on the field so start bringing out a bunch of preferably strong monsters so you can back him up without worry! I've been playing Supreme Kings since they came out and built the deck the way I like it."

Other cards like Spiritual Forest and Wall of Thorns can further stall attacks, especially if you control all of them at once. The offensive strategy comes into play when the deck's powerful Synchro and XYZ boss monsters reach the field, with efficient help from low-level Tuners like Hope Ear Squadron and Rose Girl. Board-clearing traps (like Torrential and Wall of Thorns) are built in to reinforce the risk of backfire, so your board is protected and allowed to build each turn.  Lonefire is an amazing going-first Normal summon, with an effect allows you to special summon any Plant monster from your Deck by tributing itself (or another Plant you control). If you have set Wall of Thorns and control Lonefire in Attack position, you can Bait an attack on Lonefire and destroy their attack-position monsters, but if they don't attack, you benefit from Lonefire's effect each turn until it's off the field. Rose Paladin helps get main deck bosses to your hand and onto the field as quickly as possible via discarding herself to allow you a Deck search. For the Tuners, Hop Ear lets you Synchro summon during your opponent's turn, while Rose Girl recycles herself back to your hand and, being a Level 3 Earth type, can XYZ summon Meliae who can either give you a foolish burial effect (to send Hermitree), or the special summon (in defense) of any Plant from your Deck (almost always going to be Chirubime).  Foolish Burial is almost always used to send Sylvan Hermitree to the GY, which by effect, allows you to re-arrange the top three cards of your Deck in any order, giving you more control over your next turn. Chirubime sets up a wall, special summons other Plants from the Deck, is an Earth-type and serves as excellent Rank-8 material. Any card effect that lets me special summon a Plant directly from my Deck is almost always going to be used on Chirubime in DEF for her amazing effects. Talaya is like a more offensive Level 8 Water-type version of Chirubime, who protects your other Plants from card effects while giving herself an ATK boost off of them. I'm still looking into alternative boss monsters for the Main Deck (Level 8 or 9 for the XYZ summons) and am absolutely open to hearing suggestions!  The Synchro and XYZ monsters are what will give your opponent the most trouble. Ideally, Black Rose Dragon is summoned at the correct time to clear the field and go in for game. Queen of Thorns is super useful in this deck, especially if Ancient Forest is at play. She does 1,000 Burn damage to your opponent for every non-Plant monster they summon until she's dealt with. If she's destroyed by battle, your opponent's attacking monster is too (if you control Ancient Forest), and if Spiritual Forest is also on the field, she's protected from one attack per turn (you still take battle damage). Fairy King (XYZ) is extremely easy to bring out as well, using Rose Paladin and/or Eco. In addition to being great XYZ material in this deck, Eco can dual-serve as a hand-trap when/if burn damage is dealt to you, being special summoned rather than discarded.  The World Tree, if preserved, grows counters when Plants go to the GY, two of which can be removed to destroy one card on the field. Plenty of Plant monsters end up in and out of the GY with this Deck, so this effect can usually go off once per turn as long as the tree stands. You can use Frozen Rose to send one Plant to the GY to draw two and feed the World Tree one counter. Wall of Thorns is like running three copies of Mirror Force, enforcing the deck's overall defensive-yet-aggressive strategy when you bait an attack. I think Spiritual Forest is stupid good in this deck as well, putting up yet another reason why your opponent would<strong> not</strong> want to declare an attack, forcing them to use card effects to get rid of your board."

The goal was to work with Sephylon's difficult summoning condition and make him a viable boss monster in a deck, where the Level 8 Fairies he can summon also perform well on their own as powerful bosses in their own right (Primarily Kristya with 1x Hyperion as a backup boss (interchangeable with Vanity's Ruler, Guardian Eatos (although not searchable), Phosphorage, Majestic Mech - Goryu, Splendid Venus, or whatever high level Fairy you choose)).  The Herald of Perfection can grant you at least one, usually up to three, negates per turn, by discarding other Fairy monsters from your hand (Heralds are hand-traps in and of themselves). I run 3x Purple Herald in the side deck in case I face a trap-heavy deck (thinking Eldlich). The Heralds' discard effects quickly fill your GY and make summoning Sephylon possible, who can be searched by Card of the Soul (while you have 8000K Life Points) or Power Angel Valkyrie. Power Angel can search Sephylon from the deck if she's on the field while you negate something your opponent does, most easily accomplished by discarding a Fairy while you control Perfection. An alternative is to activate something like a Solemn trap while you control Power. The Agent of Creation / Shine Ball engine is not only great for getting 3-4 Fairies in the GY quickly, but also for the obvious Link-summoning capabilities. Manju makes getting Perfection on the field doable within 2 turns.  While Sanctum of the Parshath is on the Field, you can Link summon Celestial Airknight Parshath and use its effect to add Sephylon to your hand from your Deck. This card with Hyperion allows you to pop two cards per turn by banishing Fairies from your GY, which shifts focus from the Sephylon strategy to a different one, where Fairies are being <strong>removed</strong> from the GY and thus casting aside fuel for Sephylon's summoning. Foolish Burial is just plain helpful for filling the GY with monsters more quickly. Valhalla is there to special summon Kristya or Hyperion to avoid bricking with them. Terraforming is still in the Side Deck only because I once ran a single copy of The Sanctuary in the Sky to protect against battle damage."

This is a Blue-Eyes Trap-Control build with an extended discussion on deck-building theory and ,"No audacious claims here that this is 'the best, most consistent, least bricky Blue-Eyes deck ever'. Players would do right to view any claims like that with a lot of skepticism, especially if they lack documented success in competitive play. For my part, I have not competed with this deck in a tournament yet, though I plan to take it to locals while Skill Drain is still at x3--if for no other reason than to have fun playing Blue-Eyes again.  But the reason I've embraced this build at all is because of the success of other players who have taken similar builds--the Blue-Eyes Trap Control build--to locals and won. HaltessiaGaming (YouTube channel name) has won several OTS local tournaments playing this variant of Blue-Eyes, gradually over time moving towards a heavier fusion build. Credit to HaltessiaGaming, his YouTube deck profiles and combo videos go over the theory behind his deck-building strategy in great detail. Whether players take up the trap-control build or not, they're worth studying for competitive players because of how fearlessly they cast away long-held deck-building dogma around 'how you have to run Blue-Eyes'. Practice is the sole criterion of truth, and the fact that no other Blue-Eyes builds are seeing success--let alone topping--tournaments speaks for itself.  <strong>Dogma is Dead</strong>  I was skeptical of the Blue-Eyes control build for some time--mainly turned off by how fragile a strategy revolving around True Light seemed. But what really got my attention with HaltessiaGaming's build was that, originally, he played the vanilla Blue-Eyes White Dragon at x2 and the Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, which is treated as the vanilla on-field or in-grave, at x1.  That's basically heresy among Blue-Eyes players, who have feverishly insisted that the vanilla is played at x3 and the Alternative White Dragon at x2 (some die-hards insist on playing it at x3 but this is no longer widely accepted). Of course this is Blue-Eyes we're talking about so the x5-6 level-8 dragons--all of whom are considered 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' on the field or in-grave, mind you--are joined with a host of other level-8 dragons. The high probability of opening with an unplayable hand necessitates running other cards like Trade-In at x3, which Blue-Eyes players have rationalized as a 'draw engine' (in fact, Trade-In mills the deck but only replaces itself and the level-8 monster discarded, making it a +0). ""It's called Brick-Eyes for a reason,"" says the old saying. Of course the deck bricks. It's loaded up with unnecessary monsters that certain players feel an attachment to including but rarely go live by themselves!  In my other deck profiles, I've talked in some detail about deck-building theory as it relates to Blue-Eyes and bricking. Blue-Eyes decks haven't had an issue searching their signature monsters or getting them out onto the field. The main issue is how overloaded these decks have been with extenders and boss monsters, who not only show up in opening hands in place of critical starters but, more importantly, take up valuable deck space that would normally go towards hand traps, board-breakers and other cards you would traditionally associate with 'going second'. Its consistency is problematic, sure, but even the boards it creates have tended to lack staying power into turn-2.  Worse still, traditional Blue-Eyes staples like Trade-In are absolutely devastating targets for an opponent to hit with Ash Blossom, blowing out 33-40% of a player's opening hand depending on whether they went first or second. A lot of the Blue-Eyes staples have had similar vulnerabilities, notably Melody of Awakening Dragon (played below), but the generic discard-1 cost of Melody is easier to fulfill and can often mitigate the damage of disruption (for example, by discarding either of the White Stones).  <strong>What did the Battle of Chaos support do for BEWD?</strong>  Thanks to the new support released in Battle of Chaos, a lot of the fundamental weaknesses associated with Blue-Eyes decks can be fixed. Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon has practically replaced Alternative as the main level-8 extender to get on the board with its powerful, non-targeting bounce effect, its field protection of other cards, and its outrageously simple summoning requirements. Jet Dragon is a boss monster that can easily function as a hand trap--its one drawback being its requirement that a Blue-Eyes White Dragon be in grave.  Similarly, Dictator of D. is a badly needed special summon that foolishes Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the deck for cost and can easily bring out any of the deck's big dragons from the grave. Its effect designating the target for opponent attacks comes up less frequently but can make an impact in shoring up an established board. It acts a lot like Magicians' Souls does for Dark Magician decks, albeit without the now-coveted draw power of the latter, and gave the deck another essential starter alongside Sage With Eyes of Blue, the White Stone of Ancients and--sometimes--the White Stone of Legend. I won't go into the specific combo lines here since others have outlined this and more in detail already, but Dictator + Sage practically gets the deck to full-combo.  Ultimate Fusion, too, is an outstanding extender that really ties a tighter fusion build together with the trap-control variant. When using Blue-Eyes White Dragons from the field, it pops face-up cards on your opponent's field. More importantly, though, it recycles its fusion materials by shuffling them back into the deck. This singular function enables Blue-Eyes decks to play fewer level-8 bricks since it keeps replenishing search and summon targets for cards like Dictator of D., the White Stone of Ancients and Melody of Awakening Dragon to grab. It's also a quick-play, allowing it to synergize exceedingly well with traps like True Light (which can also search and set Ultimate Fusion).  Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon, a two-year old card, has finally found its moment too. It's able to search and add Jet Dragon to hand during the End Phrase when summoned off the White Stone of Ancients and serves as a level-8 body for Formula Synchron to make Baronne de Fleur off Halqifibrax's second effect. Polymerization at x1 helps potentially get a Blue-Eyes from hand to grave without recycling it back into the deck, but Abyss Dragon also searches it to net a +1 on summon--provided a BEWD is in the graveyard already. But equally significant, in-grave, players can banish Abyss Dragon to give their dragons a +1000 ATK boost, allowing two Blue-Eyes White Dragons and/or Jet Dragon to OTK an opponent. Obviously the card has skyrocketed in price, and while it's certainly optimal, it's also not necessary. Neither of HaltessiaGaming's two builds, for instance, used Abyss Dragon.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Trap House &amp; Skill Drain</strong>  Konami's decision to return Skill Drain to x3 had major implications for the format. Eldlich decks saw an immediate boost from the infamous continuous trap's return to unlimited play. But as HaltessiaGaming's deck profile and theory discussions have pointed out, Blue-Eyes decks can benefit immensely from Skill Drain too. Even when it was limited to x1, most Blue-Eyes decks played Skill Drain. The reasons are clear: Most of the monster effects that summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon and its counterparts resolve off the field, allowing the deck's core beatdown strategy to play around the otherwise devastating floodgate. Most Blue-Eyes monsters are at 3000 ATK or more, effects aside, making them formidable in matchups with decks that require an elaborate choreography of monster effects to climb into big extra deck monsters. Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, the new fusion monster released in Battle of Chaos, is also unaffected by trap cards, meaning that if the Tyrant Dragon is already on the field when Skill Drain resolves, its effects are not negated.  But Skill Drain isn't the only advantage Blue-Eyes has in this format. With so many decks using Artifact Scythe to restrict use of the extra deck, Blue-Eyes trap-control builds can play around another devastating floodgate. With the amount of on-field protection offered by main deck cards like True Light and Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon, players can maintain and even win with a board without relying on the extra-deck.  These are just features of the format. Some obnoxious Blue-Eyes dogmatists have flippantly dismissed the trap-control build for relying on Skill Drain x3 to win, arguing that without the trap, the deck couldn't win. Sure. That's true. But that's exactly the nature of any format. The restriction or un-restriction of certain cards changes the lineup of decks that can perform well or poor. What works in one format won't necessarily work in another format, owing in part to a particular deck's strengths and weaknesses. Blue-Eyes decks have a lot of weaknesses, even now, but this is a format that also showcases its potential strengths. Not only is there nothing wrong with playing to those strengths in the format; it's a necessity for competitive-minded players looking to bring out this iconic creature of destruction.  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  Blue-Eyes probably isn't a viable strategy beyond the local level, even with the new support. The deck still has consistency issues, albeit much fewer than previous eras, and there's a lower power ceiling for the deck in general. Some of this is mitigated by playing more hand traps and real traps, but other than making Baronne de Fleur via Halqifibrax, you're not able to throw many negates on-board. With that in mind, the trap-control variant plays a longer game than many Blue-Eyes players are familiar with--a long game that makes liberal use of True Light to keep pace. That brings obvious vulnerabilities too. And while I'm convinced that playing 2x BEWD, 1x Alternative White Dragon is a better ratio for consistency in general--you want to be able to play your opening hand, after all--occasionally you run into the issue of not being able to activate certain effects without a BEWD on-field or in-grave. Cards like Foolish Burial, Dragon Shrine and obviously Dictator of D. tremendously help with this.  In closing though, I appreciate those players who take a look at new support and aren't afraid to roll back existing deck-building dogma. They're seeing some success--the most Blue-Eyes decks have seen in at least a year--and that's worth taking note. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.  Good luck and have fun, comrades."

The decks still have that old school yugioh feel to them. Card advantage is key and you always try to play around staples like Heavy Storm and Mirror Force, giving it that chess feel to it. Yet it feels somewhat modern in that decks are capable of being very aggressive and generating advantage on the spot. If you're not careful your opponent can easily push for game or create a game state that's hard to out with just one or two cards.</span>  <span>While every format has its own meta, with some deck being better than others, I've tried a variety of decks and have yet to see one that feels straight up bad. And I've played Brainwash Turbo so that really says a lot! (I'll get to that one at a later date) There are a lot of decks to play and have fun with.</span>  <span>Sadly, most people don't commit their time to writing decklists for a 12 year old format (shockers, I know). Also there's edisonformat[dot]com, a website for Edison decks, tournaments, rules and cardpool. However when it comes to creating and sharing decks no website beats ygoprodeck so I decided to start uploading my Edison decks here in hope to inspire people to create and share decklists of their own.</span>  <span>As of now the deck's I have created are all heavily inspired (or in some cases almost completely copy and pasted. What, am I not supposed to play Mirror Force and co.?) by decks found on edisonformat[dot]com so I'll try linking the original deck/deck that served as a basis for my decks here, too.</span>  <span>With that being said, let's get into the deck that first got me into Edison: <span>Flamvell Synchro Assault Mode</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>This idea is to destroy monsters by battle using </span><span><a data-name=""Flamvell Firedog"">Flamvell Firedog</a></span><span> to then summon <span><a data-name=""Flamvell Magician"">Flamvell Magician</a></span>, turning Firedog into a 1-card Synchro 8. In most cases you'll go into <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> but this deck is on a large Synchro Toolbox, allowing for a variety of Synchro plays. Once you have your Flamvells in rotation, <span><a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a></span> allows for immediate advantage, resulting in <em>at least</em> a Synchro 8.</span>  <span>The Assault Mode engine gives you access to both a 1900 ATK beater as well as consistent access to <span><a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a></span> thanks to <span><a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a></span>. Once you've summoned Stardust Dragon you can tribute it for <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a></span>. This card is decent by modern standard, meaning it's absolutely broken by 2010's. It's your classic negate everything kind of omni-negate. But that wouldn't be modern enough now, would it. So obviously, in good old 2022 fashion this card also floats. If your opponent manages to out it you get to summon a Stardust Dragon from your GY.</span>  <span>The Flamvell engines is pretty good by itself but getting to Firedog is key. The Gravekeeper engine allows to keep on pressuring your opponent without committing to too many staples to even out the board state. Either wall up with two <span><a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Spy"">Gravekeeper's Spies</a></span> or use <span><a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Descendant"">Gravekeeper's Descendant</a></span> for removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>I've already talked about the Flamvell engine, consisting of 3 of each Flamvell Firedog, Flamvell Magician and Rekindling</span>  <span>The Assault Mode engine consists of the 3 Assault Beasts and one copy of each Assault Mode Activate and Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. Assault Beast is still a good beater at worst.</span>  <span>Since this deck is a Synchro Toolbox deck it runs <span><a data-name=""Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"">Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a></span> for Synchro 6 and 7 plays. Plague can also be used to put Stardust Dragon/Assault mode on top of your deck the turn you want to summon it, since Assault Mode Activate cannot Special Summon from hand.</span>  <span>Rekindling is an unsearchable power card so <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span> helps accessing it consistently.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a></span> can't search your Flamvell engine nor can it search Assault Beast but it can search cards for almost every game state. I can add Spy to stall, <span><a data-name=""Sniper Hunter"">Sniper Hunter</a></span> for removal and either a level 2, 3 or 4 Tuner.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Credits to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/rogue-decks-gravekeeper-flamvell</span>"

I will go over some of the combos that can be done with this deck. The extra deck was cut down to 13 to combat DD Dynamite bots in Master Duel but if you arent as worried about that, you can add standard staples such as zeus, bagooska, tornado dragon, etc. The main downside of this deck is its cost (in master duel) the majority of the cards are URs/SRs so there are a lot of expensive cards. The packs you'll wanna target are champions of hope and onomatopair-up (and the recontract universe structure deck for astraltopia) <h3>Full Combo:</h3> Starting Board: Three (unique) onomat monsters  Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf -&gt; Utopic Sage + Ascended Sage + Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf (returned via effects, first utopic, then dodododwarf)  Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf + Zubababancho -&gt; Primathmech + Astraltopia (summoned via 3 card effect)  &nbsp;  Alternate Start: Utopic Onomat + Zubababancho + both ZS monsters  Utopic Onomat + Ascended/Armed Sage -&gt; Utopic Sage + Ascended/Armed Sage + Utopic Onomat (returned via effects)  Utopic Onomat + Zubababancho + Ascended Sage -&gt; Primathmech + Astraltopia (summoned via 3 card effect)  &nbsp;  Rest of Combo:  Primath + Utopic Sage -&gt; Utopic Future -&gt; Utopic Draco Future  Astraltopia + Discard -&gt; Zexal Construction  Astraltopia + Ascended Sage -&gt; Utopia Double -&gt; Utopia + Double or Nothing  Zexal Construction + Double or Nothing -&gt; Phantom Knights Rank-Up-Magic  Utopia -&gt; Utopia Prime -&gt; 4 material Utopia Dragonar  4 material Utopia Dragonar -&gt; 2 material Utopia Dragonar + 1 material Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray  1 material Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray -&gt; Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray w/ Equipped Pegasus  Set Phantom Knights Rank-Up-Magic and pass turn (set activity queue from auto to on if in master duel so you get earliest chance to activate dragonar)  Opponent's Turn:  2 material Utopia Dragonar -&gt; 0 material Utopia Dragonar + 0 material (important for rank-up-magic) Diablosis  Diablosis + Rank-Up-Magic -&gt; Kali Yuga w/ Full Board Negation for turn (persists through removal, and negates your board too)  &nbsp;  Final Board: Utopic Drago Future w/ monster negate and steal (if on board), Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray w/ two monster negates (on board), Dragonar w/attack negation quick effect, and Kali Yuga with (both sides) spell &amp; trap removal  &nbsp;  Potential Modifications:  If you draw the phantom knights rank-up magic/zexal construction, or astraltopia, you can skip primath and instead use two material to summon gagaga magician (which can be used to summon utopia-&gt;C39 Utopia Ray-&gt;Utopia Lightning if you choose to add them to your deck) as the second material for utopic future  If you draw double or nothing, skip utopia double  If you draw pegasus, use zexal construction to replace it in the deck instead of double or nothing  &nbsp; <h3>Partial Combos:</h3> PC1: If the best you can start with is something like Utopic Onomat, Zubaba, and one ZS monster (or any other setup where cant get 4 material on the board after utopic sage), you can skip the utopic draco future summon and just go for dragonar alone. In this case, you will summon hope harbinger instead of diablosis on your opponent's turn for a single spell negation.  PC2: Worst Case senario that you can still get a combo off is when you can only summon two monsters to the board. This usually happens when youre going second and need to use most of your hand to negate the opponent's monsters through effects such as droplet. In this case, just go utopia double-&gt;utopia + double or nothing. Certainly not as powerful as the previous combos, but if your opponent has an attack position monster with 2k or less attack (or 4k if one of the two monsters you got out was armed sage, allowing you to get asura strike) you can still end the game in that turn if you negate your own attack and then activate double or nothing  There are likely other partial combos i missed but most of them are likely just going to be bits of the full combo, so go out there and experiment and find the combos you prefer."

Synchros. Let's combine the two!","If you know me, you know i love the Phantom Knights archetype. But what most people don't know about me is that i love synchro spam decks. So I got to thinking, how can i mash these two concepts together into one deck? well here it is, the fruits of my tomfoolery have led me into a slippery slope of jank madness. If you want a quick description of the deck I have presented to you here, it would be that this deck is literally just Infernoble Knight, but without the Infernoble Knights  Unlike the ""PK but it's a Fusion Deck"" counterpart to this list (which you can find here <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/phantom-knights-but-its-a-fusion-deck-now/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/phantom-knights-but-its-a-fusion-deck-now/</a>), this deck is leagues more complicated when it comes to combos. So let me show you what this deck is supposed to do.  The key cards for most of your combos are as follows: Isolde, Halqifibrax, Auroradon. (kinda like Infernobles)  &nbsp;  Most combos go as follows: <ol>  	<li>get 2 warriors on board to get <a data-name=""Isolde"">Isolde</a>, anything will do</li>  	<li>use Isolde's second effect to get your tuner of choice (I chose Comrade Swordsman of Landstar cuz it's funny)</li>  	<li>use Isolde and tuner of choice to make <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and use the effect to get <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a></li>  	<li>use Halq and 001 to make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> and use his effect to get 3 tokens, triggering 001 to special from grave.</li>  	<li>use 001 and 1 token to make <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></li>  	<li>use Auroradon's effect to special <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> from deck by removing the other 2 tokens</li>  	<li>use Coltwing's effect to get 2 tokens, triggering 001 again</li>  	<li>use Coltwing, 001, and 1 token to make <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> (coltwing is level 6 because of his effect)</li> </ol> End Board Results: Auroradon, Herald (omni negate), Baronne (2nd omni negate) and a spare token.  It's also important to know that the combo listed above is entirely possible after making Bardiche, which means you can stack a <a data-name=""fog blade"">fog blade</a> or two if you want to make the combo longer"

The two ""best"" decks of the Edison format are arguably Diva HERO and Vayu Turbo, yet neither of them was played back in April 2010. The decks played back then weren't bad. Many of them, like Jeff Jones' 1st place Dandywarrior Quickdraw, are still viable today. However, after spending so much time with a specific format people found new decks and strategies. One of them is <span>Diva HERO</span>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>Diva HERO decks constantly try to put pressure on your opponent, thanks to almost every card generating advantage. You have <span><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a></span> that can search you another monster to keep the card advantage going. <span><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a></span> not only provides a body for free but makes summoning <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> laughably easy. </span>  <span>Pressuring your opponent with Synchros and impactful main deck monsters like <span><a data-name=""Caius the Shadow Monarch"">Caius the Shadow Monarch</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span> is pretty good on its own but what makes this deck shine is it's capability to completely abuse one of the only few generic HERO Fusion monsters that were released back in 2010: <span><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a></span>. This card is very difficult to out and you can potentially summon more than one a turn.</span>  <span>With every card generating you advantage and keeping on the pressure you'll often find yourself in an advantageous game state during which you can then push for lethal with Absolute Zero, Stardust Dragon, DAD, etc.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>For the HERO half of the deck you're obviously on the aforementioned Stratos and two Malicious. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Diamond Dude,""><span>Destiny HERO - Diamond Dude</span>,</a> who despite its low ATK stat and inconsistent effect still proves to be quite threatening since its effect can be very strong if it resolves and worst case he'll get you closer and closer even to your powerful spells even if its effect misses. If you have Caius or a Malicious in hand and don't mind commiting your normal summon to him you can also search <span><a data-name=""Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy"">Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy</a></span>. It's a free Special Summon which makes for great tribute fodder. If you tribute it for Malicious you'll even get a draw during the End Phase.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a></span>, although technically part of the HERO package, deserves it's seperate mention. It summons Absolute Zero by banishing materials in the GY. Nothing's easier than putting a few monsters in the GY in a format in which games take longer than a single turn. You play a large amount of WATER and HERO monsters and will barely ever find yourself out of luck.</span>  <span>Thanks to cards like Malicious and Miracle Fusion it's very easy to control the number of DARKs in your GY. That means that you can easily set up a Dark Armed Dragon even if you draw into him late into the game.</span>  <span>Now onto the Diva engine. The engine consists of a playset of <span><a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a></span> and a <span><a data-name=""Spined Gillman"">Spined Gillman</a></span> as the target. Don't forget that Diva can summon itself to link climb into a Synchro 8 with just another level 4 monster. I'll include <span><a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a></span> and two <span><a data-name=""Snowman Eater"">Snowman Eater</a></span> here since they are still WATER monsters that provide advantage and are used as material for Absolute Zero afterwards, even though they're not searchable by Diva.</span>  <span>Last but not least I quickly want to mention <span><a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a></span>. Pre-errata this card sends the materials to the GY when it resolves. This allows to mill both Treeborn Frog and Malicious and sets up your GY for Miracle Fusion, too. Fantastic.</span>  &nbsp;  General credits to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/category/diva-heroes"

NR is a Master Duel Festival format with only N and R rarity cards. I've been testing this list for two weeks, and I think ","Welcome to this Marincess NR deck profile. NR is a Master Duel Festival format with only N and R rarity cards. I've been testing this list for two weeks, and I think I've came up with a solid and fun to play list. Marincess Sea Horse is the most important card in this deck, as it allows us to combo easily. Tin Goldfish is very useful in this recipe because it allows us to summon from hand any of the other LV4 we carry. Mermail Abysspike is an awesome card, as it allows us to search for Marincess Sea Horse when needed. Silent Angler is a good extender, but can be difficult to use in the first games due to the restriction it sets after being special summoned.  Tenyi Spirit - Shthana should always be special summoned first if it is in hand on our first turn. Marincess Basilalima isn't as good as I'd like, but we run it because we can Link 1 summon with it and it is a LV4 that can be summoned from hand by Tin Goldfish. Silent Sea Nettle is a very good water extender that allows us to recycle cards from both Main Deck and Extra Deck. Both Magical Mallet and Moray of Greed give us a lot of draw power, allowing us to risk sometimes unimportant cards to get the extender we need. Forbidden Chalice is a staple in this format. We also use Paleozoic Dinomischus and Marincess Wave to disrupt.  When it's not possible to summon both Marincess Blue Slug and Marincess Sea Angel in the same turn, opt for Marincess Sea Angel and prioritise getting Marincess Battle Ocean.  One of the basic non-standard combos in other Marincess variants that you're going to see a lot here is as follows: <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Mermail Abysspike, discard 1 water monster, search for Marincess Sea Horse.</li> </ul> You need an extender here, Tin Goldfish before Mermail Abysspike, Tenyi Spirit - Shthana before anything else, or an extender like Silent Sea Nettle now. <ul>  	<li>Special summon Silent Sea Nettle.</li>  	<li>Link 2 with Mermail Abysspike and Silent Sea Nettle. Link summon Marincess Crystal Heart.</li>  	<li>Special summon Marincess Sea Horse to a zone Marincess Crystal Heart points to.</li>  	<li>Link 1 with Marincess Sea Horse. Link summon Marincess Sea Angel and use Marincess Sea Angel's effect to search for Marincess Battle Ocean.</li>  	<li>Activate Marincess Battle Ocean.</li>  	<li>Link 3 with Marincess Crystal Heart and Marincess Sea Angel. Link summon Marincess Marbled Rock and use Marincess Battle Ocean's effect.</li> </ul> Now we have Marincess Battle Rock in the Extra Monster Zone with protection, with two different Marincess Links equipped and an attack above 3000.  That's a basic combo without the best cards, you can do it from many starters and sometimes get Marincess Blue Slug and equip it as well, Marincess Battle Rock achieving an attack of 4500.  Put Forbidden Chalice, Paleozoic Dinomischus and Marincess Wave to good use, don't be too greedy and use them when they would do the most damage to your opponent.  Don't worry too much if they only destroy Marincess Battle Ocean, you can recover it with Marincess Marbled Rock's effect and activate it again. Your Marincess Marbled Rock will gain its corresponding attack bonus and regain its protection against opponent's card effects.  Feel free to customize this list to your liking."

Its targeting protection requires a roll of 3 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Terrorking Archfiend"">Terrorking </a>- <span>A DARK Fiend monster with 2000 ATK that negates the effects of monsters it destroys by battle. Its targeting protection requires a roll of either 2 or 5 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Infernalqueen Archfiend"">Infernalqueen </a>- <span>A FIRE Fiend monster that has an effect that boosts an ""Archfiend""'s monster's ATK by 1000 during the Standby Phase, until the End Phase. Its targeting protection requires a roll of either 2 or 5 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Darkbishop Archfiend"">Darkbishop </a>- <span>A WATER Fiend monster that does not have a unique effect, but its targeting protection requires a roll of either 1, 3, or 6 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Imprisoned Queen Archfiend"">Imprisoned Queen </a>- <span>A Level 8 DARK Fiend monster that has an effect that boosts an ""Archfiend""'s monster's ATK during only your Standby Phase, until the End Phase, although it requires you to both have a face-up ""<a data-name=""Pandemonium"">Pandemonium</a>"" and it to be in the GY.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>There is also <a data-name=""Skull Archfiend of Lightning"">Skull Archfiend of Lightning</a>, a <a data-name=""Summoned Skull"">Summoned Skull</a> retrain that is also an honorary Chess Archfiend, since it also has a targeting protection that requires a roll of either 1, 3, or 6 to negate an opponent's card effect that specifically targets itself, and destroy that card.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Archfiend General"">Archfiend General</a>, <a data-name=""Archfiend Commander"">Archfiend Commander</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Archfiend Cavalry"">Archfiend Cavalry</a> - <span>Your classic combo usually involves pitching General to search for Pandemonium and activate it, Normal Summon Cavalry, Special Summon Commander, then mandatory destroy Cavalry. This will trigger two things, both your Pandemonium to search and your Cavalry to Special Summon itself. Do keep in mind that for Cavalry to trigger its Special Summon effect, you'd need to have at least 1 more ""Archfiend"" monster in the GY. Playing more copies of either of the three is fine.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror"">Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror</a> - <span>Your boss monster. A Level 8 DARK Fiend monster that has an effect that enables it to be Normal Summoned without Tributing at a cost of halving its ATK and DEF, and if it was summoned this way, it is destroyed during the End Phase. It also has a targeting removal effect that banishes an ""Archfiend"" card from your hand or GY to destroy a card on the field.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Trance Archfiend"">Trance Archfiend</a> - <span>The one of, in which you'd usually play more copies of in a regular build since it allows you to recover your banished ""Archfiend"" cards for the purposes of Archfiend Emperor's effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Brain Control"">Brain Control</a> - <span>Semi-limited in the N/R rarity only format. Adds more pressure and helps you get rid of problematic monsters, provided they can be targeted.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> - <span>Back row removal. This could also be <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a>.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> - <span>Also another way of dealing with high ATK monsters, so long as they can be targeted. Could literally be any card of your choice.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Archfiend Staff of Despair"">Archfiend Staff of Despair</a> - <span>Another way of you dealing with high ATK monsters as well, and can recur itself back to the hand at a cost of 1000 LP. You could choose whether to play this card or not, usually the latter in favor of another copy of the next card.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Falling Down"">Falling Down</a> - <span>A <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a>, but costs you LP instead of healing your opponent, and also destroys itself if you do not control another ""Archfiend"" card but hey, a nerfed Snatch Steal is still a Snatch Steal.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Pandemonium"">Pandemonium</a> - <span>The reason why you're still not dead despite all that maintenance cost, because it makes it so that neither player has to pay LP during the Standby Phase for the effect of ""Archfiend"" monsters. It also allows you to search an ""Archfiend"" monster with a different Level upon the destruction of one.</span></span>  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Archfiend's Roar"">Archfiend's Roar</a> - <span>It's <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, but it requires you to pay LP and it destroys that monster during the End Phase. Your best target for this usually is Archfiend Cavalry, at least in this list. Some people only play 2 of these, which is understandable and completely fine.</span></span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Call of the Archfiend"">Call of the Archfiend</a> - <span>It's also <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, but only for Level 5 or higher Fiend monsters and requires you to discard a Fiend monster specifically as a cost. Some people only play 1 of this since it requires set up, but I like the added security in case my opponent outs the first one.</span></span>  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  <span>None, you absolutely could play this deck by itself and it'll probably work itself out just fine, but in a full power build, you'll usually either run <a data-name=""Archfiend's Manifestation"">Archfiend's Manifestation</a>, <a data-name=""Archfiend's Call"">Archfiend's Call</a>, and <a data-name=""Archfiend's Ascent"">Archfiend's Ascent</a> and sometimes <a data-name=""Archfiend's Awakening"">Archfiend's Awakening</a> too, and a copy or two of <a data-name=""Masterking Archfiend"">Masterking Archfiend</a>, with either <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, or <a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a> since you run a plenty of Level 6 monsters, for consistency. You could splash in some <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>s and high ATK targets as well, that'd be acceptable too.</span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts</strong></span>  <span>This deck performed better than the 2 other decks that I'm still currently testing lately for the N/R rarity only event, I'll give it that, but not having access to both <a data-name=""Archfiend Heiress"">Archfiend Heiress</a> and <a data-name=""Archfiend Empress"">Archfiend Empress</a> really hurts, since it could've definitely been faster with the addition of the said cards and <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> as well. Not having access to high impact staples and floodgate really hurts too, since the main deck monsters usually aren't enough by just themselves. Overall, It's fine, but is being carried by the staples even more due to the lack of access to the high rarity support. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Main strategy is the good ol' Rank 5 into Nova and Infinity, for the omni negate and monster absorbtion, by either luckily drawing Core, Nashe or Hertz + Duplication, or Galaxy Soldier Shenanigans, using Nashe to revive a regular Cyber Dragons...  Having a Cyber Dragon on the field (or ready to be summoned) + Kaiju = Remove anything from the board by summoning Fortress Dragon.  Megafleet does the same but without the Kaiju, you need the opponent's monster to be on the extra zone tho.  Zeus is there a bit just because I have him, never really used it, but could be useful I guess.  Almiraj sends Hertz to the graveyard if you have nothing else.  If you manage to summon Rampage and Sieger you can potentially OTK very easily, Rampage can even win you the game by himself if there's no monsters on the opponent's field and he's at 6300LP or less.  To link climb from Hiita to Accesscode, you'd need to have summoned almiraj at some point and have him on the graveyard, then summon Hiita, so normal summon an Ash Blossom or, link her away with something and then you want your opponent to have another Ash on the GY, (or another fire monster) to revive it when you summon Hiita, then link them away to summon Transcode Talker, and use Transcode's effect to revive Almiraj, and then finally Accesscode, made from a link 3, so 5300ATK.  I haven't really used Eternity, but it is really hard to remove, as long as you have some other fusion machine monster on the GY, and that's easy to do with megafleet and fortress dragons, Eternity will be untargetable and inmune to all effects, so it can only be killed by battle or by dropping a Kaiju on it.  &nbsp;"

Imma be real with you, this is a weird one. I present you: <span>Brainwash</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>Essentially, this is an OTK deck. You're trying to give your opponent multiple strong monsters, return their control to you - the owner - and OTK on an empty board. Although this isn't always possible. Sometimes you have to settle for trading a <span><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a></span> for a potentially bigger threat or just to wall up.</span>  <span>You'll be trying to stall your opponent with cards like <span><a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a></span> (who's great tribute fodder for <span><a data-name=""Nightmare Archfiends"">Nightmare Archfiends</a></span>), <span><a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a></span>.</span>  <span>Do keep in mind your opponent's life total. Your trying to maximize on consistency with a 38 card deck + 2</span> <span><a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a></span> <span>(which simply trade for the next card in your deck) so your opponent might have 10000 LP when you're trying to push for lethal only for you to realize that you can only deal 9000 damage.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Remove Brainwashing"">Remove Brainwashing</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Owner's Seal"">Owner's Seal</a></span> are your win conditions. All your beatsticks are summoned to your opponent's side of the field and with these two cards you can return them to your control. While Remove Brainwashing seems better than Owner's Seal since it doesn't apply it's effect at a singular moment like the latter, it is easier for your opponent to remove it than it is to negate the activation of Owner's Seal so keep that in mind when searching either with <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span>.</span>  <span>I've already talked about Lava Golem, the card you're probably the most familiar with anyways. Besides it there's our honorary Knightmare and nightmare for many who've been around when he was still legal: <span><a data-name=""Grinder Golem"">Grinder Golem</a></span>. He summons himself while giving you two token, which can be used as tribute fodder for Nightmare Archfiends or <span><a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a></span>. <span><a data-name=""Volcanic Queen"">Volcanic Queen</a></span> has less attack than Lava Golem but you can't always tribute 2 monsters and you can send another monster after missing lethal to deal another 1000 damage with her effect. </span>  <span>Nightmare Archfiends is like Ojama Trio on steroids. Requires a monster/token on your side of the field but has a huge payoff if you manage to take back control. That's a total of 6000 ATK points.</span>  <span>While Cyber Valley helps drawing into your combo pieces while stalling the game Battle Fader has surprising synergy with the deck as some cards require you to have a monster/0 ATK monster on the field.</span>  <span>2 of each</span> <span><a data-name=""Magic Planter"">Magic Planter</a></span><span>, Upstart Gobling and Gold Sarcophagus help getting to your win con.</span>  <span>Backrow is omni-present in older formats so this deck is on a lot of backrow removal to ensure you are OTK'ing whenever you're ready. <span><a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Cold Wave"">Cold Wave</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></span> should get the job done.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Necessary Rulings</span>  <span>Volcanic Queen doesn't say it on her card text as she is lacking any reprints but her effect that burns a monster by sending a monster you control to the GY sends for cost. That means you cannot send Tokens for the effect.</span>  <span>Cyber Valley's effect to banish and draw 2 does not banish for cost. You can banish it and a token and still draw 2.</span>  <span>You are legally allowed to activate Remove Brainwashing and Owner's Seal even if you don't have enough free monster zones available. In that case you return as many monsters as you can and the rest are sent to the GY and considered to be destroyed by game mechanic. That means that if you cannot take control of all Nightmare Archfiends-Tokens they are destroyed while in they are in your opponent's posession and your opponent therefore takes the 800 effect damage per destroyed Token.</span>  <span>Once a monster's control has been given to its owner the control will not change back when Remove Brainwashing is removed from the field. The monster is yours for the keeping.</span>  <span>Cold Wave does not negate already applying continuous-like effects. If you already control a face-up Remove Brainwashing you can use Cold Wave and still apply its effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Credits to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/rogue-brainwashing-beatdown</span>"

My attempt is semi budget since it doesn't include the expensive Despia cards ,but utilizes a small Thunder Dragon engine.  With this deck, you can end on a board of Mirrorjade + Dragostapelia + Titan + Mercourier in hand, but you can also brick horroibly and just set 1 pass.  The card Fusion Gate is a very cool budget option in this deck. With two Dark monsters with different Types in hand (optimal TDroar + Mercourier) you can go into Dragostapelia while also searching for Kitt, which will get you to Branded Fusion.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt;Edit:  I upgradet the decklist.  Reduced TD's since the only real starter for that line is Dragonroar. Added the Gizmek and Albion instead. Albion dump Branded Blade to draw one and recycle is really nice. Some other minor changes to  enhance gameplay. Endboard stays fundamentally the same. &gt;&gt;"

I'm just bringing and updated version of my deck. Didn't change how the engine works by itself, but i adpted it for the current master duel meta and some necessities that the deck has. i will explain:  &nbsp;  On the last version i focused on using the tech slots to play against Maxx 'C' using 3 ashes 2 gammas and 2 called by the grave. it definitively works, but it takes away some of the consistency that this deck could have. (since ash blossom is a fire monster). So i decided to change some of the techs and put 3 veiler + 2 meister. They're meta relevant (plays against drytron, eldlich, tri-brigade, etc.) and they are light and dark monsters which makes Chaos Ruler effect's more relevant giving it a plenty of options to search.  &nbsp;  that's it. I will drop one of my videos that shows what this deck is capable of. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as i do :)  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Qn8DHYOvU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>"

Added deck strategy.</span>  A flexible deck, every other duel you could draw the cards needed for invoked summoning, or shaddoll summoning. Either work very well, or if you're lucky both.  Invoked strategy: You draw an aleister the invoker? Normal summon, and add invocation to your hand, you link summon Artemis the magistus moon maiden, and then fusion summon Invoked Mechaba using Invocation.  Dogmatika/Albaz strategy: I use dogmatika and albaz for a monster negate and monster removal, useful for monsters that cant be destroyed by battle or card effects. I use albaz to tribute opponents troublesome monsters. Dogmatika monsters have OTK potential, and could be used as fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct and Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll strategy: You want to efficiently use your flip monster effects here, Reeshaddoll Wendi is a great card and the most aggressive. Ideally you would want to get Winda out there as a special summon limiter. Shaddoll Schism is your ace in the hole, you will want it in a long game.  My thoughts: I like to run 3 Cosmic Cyclone here because Skill drain is such a terrible card to encounter. And 3 Crossout Designator because I was sick of my opponents always playing handtraps, both have been good additions. I am missing one more ""Dark Ruler No More"" it has been an excellent card and I like it a lot more than Effect veiler, Forbidden droplet, and Infinite impermanence.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You want to go second because you can't really do anything going first if you don't open exactly Test Tiger, a level 4 or lower Gladiator Beast and either <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attoric"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a> or <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a> in hand (you can go into Draglubion with those 3 cards). Going second gives you an extra card, allows you to attack to  start combos and makes <a data-name=""Ancient Warrior - Loyal Guan Yun"">Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun</a> a lot better, who is especially good in this deck because he opens up attack possibilities for your Gladiator Beasts. The deck is mostly build to make XYZ of different levels consistently. The huge downside is that you either have to attack (especially difficult after your first turn because you opponent can make it harder by only having monsters with high ATK and nothing in defense) or use multiple cards for that. <a data-name=""My body as a Shield"">My body as a Shield</a> is pretty bad, but this deck loses hard to <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, so I have it in for now (you can try <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a> instead, but that isn't perfect either).

You'll almost always have enough monsters on the field to OTK with it. Thunder King's effect is amazing for the OTK because it can negate card activations before you go for the Leeching the Light combo, so you don't get surprised by a battle phase hand trap or book of moon or something like that. Make sure you don't give your opponent Jizukuru before your combo with Kyoutou up because they can use its effect to negate Leeching the Light.  Kuraz can pop your own marshmacaron, baobaboon, tokens or chainable backrow for draw or clear some of the opponent's field before OTK. Refer to my other list for combos and tech choices. It's an easy deck to pilot  with a simple game plan :)  https://ygoprodeck.com/hippo-carnival-n-r-event/"

This deck is for fun, but it is more of a template for you to build onto so it can hopefully be a lot better. But I like decks with no hand traps and playing against bots on Nexus and testing hands on Edo, so I didn't add any, but Nibiru which is fun to watch your opponent cry as their entire board is destroyed in seconds. But because I don't like them, I didn't add many, it makes the deck more fun in my opinion? It can still beat decks even if they have a few negates out, but you need a really good hand to do so.

It gave us some really cool monsters that are still fan favorites to this day like Yubel, Elemental HERO Neos, Cyber Dragon. People tend to be really fond of Hydrogeddon and Crystal Beasts and Volcanics have dedicated fanbases, yearning and screeching until the day they receive playable support. Although HEROs are Jaden's signature monsters I always found the Neo-Spacians and Neos monster pretty cool. Sadly, there were anything but playable if we don't count Grand Mole as a removal tool. So you can imagine that I was incredibly stoked to see that someone created a deck in Edison that actually made use of the Neo-Spacians! And I gotta say, this deck is the reason I started writing these Edison decks in the first place. Now here's a quick disclaimer: I've only recently build this deck and played it much less than the others (as in test hands and nothing else as I've been really busy ever since I got this deck). But I gotta say this deck is incredibly fun on paper, the 50-ish test hands I had were so cool and the idea behind the deck is awesome. Here's to probably one of my favorite Edison decks: <span>Neo-Spacian.</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>In short, this deck revolves around card advantage. Almost every card in your deck interacts with <span><a data-name=""Cross Porter"">Cross Porter</a></span>, who will then add you a Neo-Spacian to hand.</span>  <span>All you need is a Cross Porter in the GY and you can summon Synchro monsters almost every turn while gaining Neo-Spacians in the process. The Neo-Spacians themselves are somewhat of a toolbox. While the monsters are pretty weak by themselves their effects can be pretty good in niche situations, some more niche than others.</span>  <span>You could consider this deck baby Diva HERO. It's a little less explosive and summons <span><a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a></span> more often than it does <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> but what it lacks in explosiveness and pressure it makes up for with the Neo-Spacian toolbox and the crazy amount of draws and adds at your disposal. <span><a data-name=""Snipe Hunter"">Snipe Hunter</a></span> will almost always have plenty of discards available and <span><a data-name=""Tragoedia"">Tragoedia</a></span> will pretty much sit at 3000 ATK constantly. You can manipulate the GY to incredible detail ensuring <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span> is live the second you want it to.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>The heart and soul of the deck is Cross Porter. When it is sent to the GY you can add a Neo-Spacian from deck to hand. Note, that it's an optional when effect, meaning it being sent has to be the very last thing to have happened in the previous chain/action before the trigger is met. If you discard it for cost, say for Snipe Hunter, it will not trigger as the last thing was the resolution of Sniper Hunter's effect. You can trigger it with <span><a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a></span> and it meets the criteria for both <span><a data-name=""Debris Dragon"">Debris Dragon</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Junk Synchron"">Junk Synchron</a></span>, who'll both negate Porters effect on the field but you only care about the effect in the GY anyways. Once you perform a Synchro summon the trigger will be met and you can add a Neo-Spacian to hand, while putting up pressure on board.</span>  <span>Since you'll be adding a Neo-Spacian to hand almost every turn <span><a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a></span> is not only a draw 2 with little to no setup required but also sets up your GY for <span><a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a></span>. This means that <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a></span>, who's limited for a reason, can be recycled multiple times. Almost all your monsters are DARK so you'll always have a card to banish with Allure of Darkness. If you don't know what to banish you can just add <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Dark Panther"">Neo-Spacian Dark Panther</a></span> and banish a copy of that one.</span>  <span>Let's talk about the Neo-Spacians. The previously mentioned Neo-Spacian Dark Panther can copy the effect of an opponent's monster. That means you can steal the pwerful effects of Dark Armed Dragon, <span><a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a></span> to name a few. Besides Dark Panther this deck is on a copy of <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a></span> and Neo-Spacian Grand Mole. The former is most commonly knows by Isolde handloops, back when Linkross was still around. You can still handloop when you have a Synchro on board but most importantly you gain knowledge into your opponent's hand. Knowing your opponent has for example <span><a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a></span> in hand can be game changing. Grand Mole bounces itself and the monster it is battling back to hand, which is a great out to many strong monsters without having to commit much. You'll be giving up your board presence but that's well worth being able to summon Grand Mole again on a later turn.</span>  &nbsp;  Credits go to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/rogue-neo-spacian-toolbox"

The adventure engine uses the brave token to allow the effects of the ridable dragon, and wandering gryphon rider to go off, and uses the effect of water enchantress to add rite of aramesir that special summon the token and activates fateful adventure from the deck (which allows you to add gryphon rider from deck to hand and equip rideable dragon to the token).  The DPE engine allows you to summon Destiny Hero - Destroy Pheonix Enforcer and use his effect to destroy your opponent's cards ( at a cost of destroying one of yours) and weaken your opponent monsters for every hero in the grave and if he were to be destroyed special summons a destiny hero from the grave including himself. As a bonus Destiny hero - Dasher during the draw phase if you draw a monster you can special summon that drawn monster without cost (but you can only do this once) and if you have no cards in your hand you can banish Destiny Hero - Celestial and one other Destiny hero to draw 2 cards."

Being able to send Fraktall, Kitt, and Nervall to the GY, but not add Kerass can still be useful since you are adding materials for Tri-Brigade Link Summons. Tri-Brigade monsters can also summon Gladiator Beast Dragases, allowing you to summon additional Gladiator Beasts, either through Dragases's own effect or by using Test Tiger.  You can use your first Augustus to summon a second Augustus, who can then summon a third Gladiator Beast. Tamer Editor's effect to summon Fusion Monsters is only once per turn per copy, so you can summon a second Tamer Editor and summon a new Fusion Monster. If you cannot summon both Heraklinos and Domitianus, the early turns of the duel will likely depend on which one you choose, depending on whether you are more concerned with monster effects or Spells and Traps. Discard costs for Heraklinos and Twin Twisters will trigger Nervall and Kitt's effects, making them viable to keep in hand for the next turn."

Sycthe Lock(For Those Who don't know): Only do this if you brick and are going first TBH, it's a very breakable board but just start by getting at least 2 monsters out to make Dagda and then start a chain with another card in your hand to trigger and set<a data-name=""Artifact Sycthe""> Artifact Sycthe</a> then get a third monster out and go into verte so you can copy <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> to Summon <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>. On Standby of your oppnent's next turn trigger Phoenix Enforcer's effect and pop your own sycthe and one other card on your field(or itself if you must) to trigger Sycthe and lock your oppnent's plays from extra deck that turn. Very effective against decks like D/D/D or Dragon Links but not very effective against Flowandereeze. If you're unsure then you can wait till Mainphase 1 do this simple chain if it wasn't Flowandereeze or use enforcer to disrupt w/e deck it is that doesn't use extra deck like popping their key cards..  Let's say you start on a good hand, it doesn't matter which drytron you start with as they can eventually extend to each other but ideally you want to end with Beta fafnir and send Metonis if it's not in your hand to the grave and then add it back with it's effect. If you don't have Benten try to get to it as this deck thrives on more rituals being in the grave for Megalith's Bethor's disruptive destruction effect or Aratron's negates. If you go for the megalith plays you go from <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> (To get Hagith)-&gt;Megalith Hagith to add <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal </a>in your hand from Hagith's effect or if you already have it get <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> -&gt; Then with <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron </a>summon back Ophiel field to add Megalith Phul -&gt; Use Hagith's effect to ritual into Phul and end your turn there-ish. These are just the barebones combo's but your Keycards are Hagith, Ophiel, and Phul. Och is in the deck in case you have a somewhat deadhand and want to use it's Dark World Dealings effect, it also has the benefit of being use as a medium to ritual summon like the other megalith's but like Phul it can do it on the oppnent's turn.  After that you just  go for what you need using Phul's effect, if your oppnent is combo-ing wait till they have 2-3 cards on board to triggle <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>and pull <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from your deck using the ritual monsters on field and hand to summon it as it gets to pop one card you oppnent controls for each ritual based monster in your grave. If you're finnishing off your oppnent then use Phul's effect to get Phaleg whic boost your atk/def stats by 500 for all monsters on your field for every ritual monster in your grave. Aratron is just in here in case your board is strong but lacks protection and you don't need Bethor's effect to popping and just want extra protection. Like for instance you end on Masq +Utopic Draco Future/Divine Arsenal Zeus.  Yes if you get desperate you can summon the handtraps as materials for your combos, they're not just for tech options. Crossout is there at three bc oh boi you're like the beta dragon links where you're Special summoning for days to get to your key cards so nibiru is your biggest threat, Ash blossom is kinda of a hit if you open with dupe Drytrons but this deck can live through at least most hand traps. Droll and Lockbird will slow you down the most so if you get hit with that but no cross-out to respond then just do the weak ass Sycthe lock and pray your oppnent has no out to it next turn. Dark ruler no more is preferred over Droplet as you want to keep a card advantage and it's just a Going 2nd filler card for this deck. Side deck has backrow hate that can be tossed in if your you're dueling a trapbased deck.  There's a lot of whack and weird boards but this is mostly a for fun deck as it's end board is not insane as Prank kid's adventure or Swordsouls.

It is not. It is an N. I checked. I don't know why it believes this is the case. But if you clicked here because of the comedy of 'haha this loser's using an SR in the N/R' format, hi! Enjoy the decklist!)  The N/R Festival is here in Master Duel; a chance to try decks far more interesting than anything in the Platinum ladder with essentially no cost. As someone who climbed into platinum using none other than a Paleozoic deck already, I decided 'hey wouldn't it be funny if I did that here too'? And so here we are!  This deck combines the powers of the Paleozoic trap-""monster"" lineup, the few decent Frogs at N/R, and the severely-underrepresented Aquaactress archetype into a single deck that boasts both disruption and sheer unga bunga power on tiny little aquatic entities. It's heavily based off <a>this list</a> made by DevilDeckYGO and direYGO (read: I netdecked for the groundworks and modified it from there), so credit where credit is due on that one. With that said, let's get into how the deck works! <h2>Step 1: Setting the Stage</h2> The heart and soul of this deck is your Field Spell and your trio of Continuous Spells. <strong>Wetlands</strong> gives all Level 2 or lower Water Aqua monsters 1200 attack; this is functionally your entire monster lineup (save two), because for some reason the Aquaactresses are Aqua despite <em>clearly </em>being fishes. Well, I won't complain. Meanwhile, the Aquarium trio all provide benefits to your WATER monsters and/or your Aquaactresses, and revive an Aqua from the grave if your foe ever removes them.  Three <strong>Aquaactress Tetra </strong>provides a scary amount of consistency; the longer it's allowed to stay on the board, the more cards it can fetch you, and you can even activate multiples of it in one turn! For this reason, <strong>Aquarium Stage</strong> is one of the most ideal searches if you're not going on the offensive - it gives your WATER monsters battle protection and your Aquaactresses specifically protection from -all- monster effects. I can't count the times foes have attempted to fire a Malevolent Sin or Relinquished only to accomplish nothing.  <strong>Aquarium Set </strong>provides a moderate 300 ATK boost to all WATER monsters and an additional 300 to Aquaactresses specifically. It's a decent choice if you already have Stage or are up against a deck that primarily uses backrow-based removal, and it's also very funny to put a new meaning to the phrase ""Set, pass"". <strong>Aquarium Lighting</strong> is the weirdest of the three, doubling attack when battling enemy monsters, but only for Aquaactresses specifically. Don't take this one unless you specifically both already have an Aquaactress and either Set or Wetlands online.  Of the other two Aquaactresses, <strong>Guppy </strong>summons an Actress from hand, and <strong>Arowana </strong>searches one from deck. I'm only running one of each of these because Guppy's useless unless you already have one of the others in hand, and Arowana needs you to tribute. Which isn't super difficult in this deck - it's easy enough to get a Paleozoic or Ronintoadin on the field - but it's still an investment (and one that can end up falling down a Bottomless Trap Hole all too easily). Needless to say, Tetra is the best of the three. <h2>Step 2: A Chorus of Croaks</h2> No Toadally Awesome in this format, but wetlands girls make do. Your frogs are an excellent way to squeeze out value over the opponent, and can become surprisingly bulky with Wetlands up.  Whether you've seen its lock or simply its advantage-gathering, you probably already know what <strong>Dupe Frog</strong> does, but <strong>Flip Flop Frog </strong>is another story. It's similar to the PACMAN cast of reusable flip-esque monsters, but unlike them, its effect fires even when flipped face up by an opponent's attack. This means Flip Flop Frog at least trades with anything attacking into it, but it gets better for three simple reasons; <ol>  	<li>Flip Flop Frog's effect is <strong>non-targeting, non-destroying removal</strong>. This means it gets around annoying thorns in the meta's side such as Invoked Cocytus or Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon (not MAX, the other one).</li>  	<li><strong>The more Frogs you have on the board, the better Flip Flop gets.</strong> Ronintoadin is a frog while it's on the field, so it's easy to bounce two or more cards on your turn and then go for a lot of damage.</li>  	<li><strong>Aquarium Stage is Flip Flop Frog's best friend. </strong>Your opponent attacks into your Flip Flop Frog, gets bounced, and Flip Flop stays alive, ready to return more cards to the hand the next turn.</li> </ol> And then we have one copy of <strong>Unifrog</strong>, who... exists. It's a bit of a silly high-roll tech choice, and you can cut it if you want, but it's searchable off Dupe Frog and gives you a way to pick away at backrow-heavy decks beyond just your Paleozoic traps.  We also have two monsters that -aren't- frogs but will be included here for brevity's sake. <strong>Dewdark of the Ice Barrier </strong>is a beatstick and Gagaga Cowboy-esque gamecloser tool. He has 1200 ATK normally, 2400 under Wetlands and more with an Aquarium Set or two involved, and can attack directly. This list runs him at 2, but feel free to modify up or down based on preference. Finally, my extreme jank tech, <strong>Mother Grizzly. </strong>Yes, a recruiter from 2004. Why? Because this format is slow enough that set monsters aren't necessarily being destroyed by effects a majority of the time, and she is one of the only ways you can search either Flip Flop Frog or Aquaactress Tetra, the two most crucial monsters for your plans. <h2>Interlude: The Back Row</h2> The Paleozoic lineup to this deck is really quite simple. 3 apiece of <strong>Olenoides, Canadia, </strong>and <strong>Dinomischus.</strong> (Oh and a single <strong>Torrential Tribute.</strong>) Olenoides is the primary form of backrow removal you have access to. In a format this slow, it's going to be very handy. If you can, fire it during the opponent's End Phase after they've set cards in order to render them inactive. Canadia is a fantastic form of disruption by setting your foes' monsters face down, and Dinomischus is the most powerful by banishing ANY face up card... but has the cost of a discard. Perhaps more notably in this deck than any other, Paleozoics can revive upon either player activating a trap card! They start off at 1200 ATK, <strong>but easily reach 2400 or higher after a Wetlands, </strong>just like Dewdark. Extra notable (and often forgotten) is that they're also immune to all monster effects when summoned this way, making them powerful beatsticks that are difficult to out via monsters! Just remember that they -will- be banished upon leaving the field unless you tuck them snugly under an Xyz Monster. <h2>Step 3: Special Guests from the Extra Deck</h2> Hoo boy. The Extra Deck options in the N/R Festival are... messy, let's say. But there's a lot of fun in that mess, so here's the rundown on the Extra Deck options this deck plays! You don't go into these super frequently, in all honesty.  <strong>Number 54: Lion Heart </strong>and <strong>Number 39: Utopia Roots</strong> are both made via three or two Tetra respectively, and either bounce battle damage and have battle immunity or negate attacks and power up vs. Xyz decks, but... well, you'll make these once in a blue moon at best. Feel free to cut them for more copies of the relevant extra deck.  The rest of your Xyz are all Rank 2, and thus more accessible. Of them, the best two are <strong>The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin, </strong>which negates a monster's effect and sucks its attack to 0, and <strong>Number 45: Crumble Logos the (et cetera), </strong>who has higher attack (2200 vs. 1600) and can negate backrow <em>or</em> monsters (as well as all other cards sharing that card's name while it remains on the field), but can't lower attack. We play 2 Javelin and 1 Logos here; if you cut anything from this extra deck, you probably can't go wrong with adding a second Logos. Out of the other Rank 2 Xyz, <strong>Herald of Pure Lights </strong>cycles cards from grave to hand to deck, but doesn't provide much advantage unless you URGENTLY need a monster from grave to hand, and <strong>Cat Shark,</strong> who is a wall you could also use to make your Logos a 4400 ATK beatstick sometimes.  The other half of the Extra Deck is links. Starting off with the two you'll be going into the most - <strong>Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</strong> is an excellently sized body for a link-2 that even revives itself once on destruction (though this won't help you against Bottomless Trap Hole), and <strong>Geonator Transverser, </strong>a serious contender for underrated MVP of the deck. Being able to swap spare weak monsters with your foes' main powerhouse comes up more often than you'd think. Watch the zones and wait for your chance.  If your opponent isn't using backrow-based monster removal, <strong>Doublebyte Dragon</strong> can just straight up win you the game, and <strong>Gravity Controller</strong> is an out for if your foe tries to do the same against you. <strong>Pentestag</strong> lets those Wetlands-boosted beatsticks break through wally foes, and <strong>Powercode Talker </strong>is at once both beatstick and effect negation. <strong>Triple Burst Dragon</strong> is just okay, feel free to cut it.  Finally, <strong>Marincess Marbled Rock</strong> is a water link. Yup, that's it. You literally can't use any of her effects, but tragically enough, you have <em>no</em> better options. <h2>Step 4: Okay, So How Do I Actually Play The Deck</h2> The number of traps you have, as well as monsters that activate best on destruction, means that first and foremost you want to go first. Don't activate your Aquariums (except for Stage) if you don't have to (i.e. not summoning an Aquaactress turn one) - the lack of information means leaving your opponents uncertain of your deck and thus less likely to play around Paleozoics/Flip Flop Frog/etc. If you have Stage and Dupe Frog in hand, it's sometimes best not to activate Stage at all, letting Dupe Frog die and thus loading your grave for an eventual Ronin as well as finding you Flip Flop. This is up to your own preference, though. Your main goal early game is to disrupt your foe's plays with your Paleozoics and Frogs before pivoting into violence through Wetlands. Some games you won't draw Wetlands at all, and that's fine; you can either chip down your opponent or attempt to use the Extra Deck instead. Don't fall for the temptation of going into your Extra Deck at the first moment, though! A lot of the times it's better to leave your aqua monsters on the field to be protected by Stage or to get the effects of cards such as Tetra or Dupe Frog. Keep a card in hand for Dinomischus where possible. Your ideal discard is Ronintoadin as an excellent way to get it into the grave, but anything works. Also, remember; both Stage-protected Aquaactress monsters and Paleozoics are immune to monster effects. This means your main threats are backrow removal (backrow that destroys monsters) and backrow removal (cards that get rid of your spells and traps). Watch your opponent's traps and make careful guesses as to what they might be; a well-timed Torrential Tribute can put you out of the game altogether. Other than all of that, this deck isn't too complex to pilot once you know what you're doing. Good luck, and enjoy your time frogging! <h2>Afterword: Other Options</h2> <strong>The ratio and types of backrow </strong>this deck uses is entirely up to you. <strong>Lost Wind, Bottomless Trap Hole, </strong>and more copies of <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong> are all great for disrupting plays.  <strong>Moray of Greed</strong> could prove useful with a higher quotient of monsters, but the fact that we're at almost exactly a 20:10:10 ratio means it's less likely to activate.  <strong>Dragon Queen of Tragic Endings</strong> is very very funny - summoning itself when you control 3+ Continuous Spells, drawing a card and making the foe discard when it deals battle damage, and reviving itself by sending a continuous spell to the grave, which also triggers your Aquariums' revive effects. It's a bit too highroll-y for my liking, but hey, give it a shot if you feel like it. <strong>Magical Broker</strong> is another way to trigger your own revival effects and also stalls for time if need be. Hooray for slow formats.  Given that Dewdark is a tuner, you could probably choose to run them at 3 and a Level 4 Synchro of your choice, of which this format has a grand total of six. Out of them, <strong>Old Entity Hastorr </strong>is probably your best bet.  <strong>Every single Paleozoic backrow </strong>is N/R. Customize as to your want.  <strong>More backrow-removing tools </strong>is highly welcomed; as both your Paleozoics (by default) and Aquaactresses (under Stage) are immune to monster effects, backrow-based disruption is their Achilles' heel. <strong>Mystical Space Typhoon, Nobleman of Extermination, </strong>and <strong>Mythical Beast Garuda</strong> are all fair options.  You can attempt to run a heavier Marincess package; both of their Link-1s are available at Rare, plus the sheer power of <strong>Marincess Wave</strong> is not to be overlooked. If you want to simply splash one in to recover off Marbled Rock, <strong>Marincess Basilalima</strong> is the most generic, I guess.  And of course, for sheer style points, accept <strong>Frog the Jam </strong>into your heart and deck-- eh? whaddya mean it's called <strong>Slime Toad</strong> now?  Thanks for reading, and feel free to comment with any severe deckbuilding issues I may have made down below!"

From there, you can get out the boss of the morphtronics, power tool dragon, or baronne de fleur for the powerful negate effect.  You can get out halq with any tuner and another monster, so you're relying on celfon to get out a tuner, or scopen to pull a non-tuner level 4 out of your hand. scopen plus a level 4 can also just lead into a level 7 synchro, and remoten helps fish scopen or more copies of celfon and smartfon. smartfon is a good fisher and a tuner you can special summon out of your hand, which also helps fulfil halq's summoning requirements.  Overall, it's not a meta deck, it's not even rogue, but it can win pretty well against other non-meta decks and can even lock horns pretty well with rogue decks like melffy or ghostricks. Baronne de Fleur is really good destruction power and a negate, you get out Accesscode talker pretty easily, and the fact that smartfon and celfon aren't limited to once per turn helps you swarm the field, especially if you manage to land machine dulplication on celfon.  An important note is that smartfon is a special summon monster, so it's not a valid target for machine duplucation. You'll be using that on celfon and remoten.  Some substitutes: radion is a thunder monster rather than a machine, so feel free to swap it out for another boomboxen or slingen, but tbh radion's attack boost is genuinely good when you have a swarm of morphtronics out. In addition, trident warrior can always be swapped for another goblindburgh for the ability to get out celfon with it, too, but sometimes trident warrior's 1800 attack does end up mattering when against a bricking deck that has a decently sized monster on the board."

Thankfully, with the power of reprints from the Albaz Strike structure deck, and some staples from the Charmer and Cyber Strike Structures to really enhance the playability of the strategy in these times of DPE Scythe spam for the budget, but realistically this deck, even full build with Prosperities and Small Worlds, albeit extremely consistent, does not put up a strong board on it's own. The deck puts up one negate, and a GY shuffle. Another issue is it's absolutely required, yet disgusting brick in Madolche Messengelato. The cards in this deck that you would use to summon Messengelato, which would be Puddingcess Chocolat-A-la-Mode and Hootcake, CANNOT summon from hand. If they would please give us something to shuffle Messengelato back and more in-archetype interruption, I think it'd make it go from rogue to absolutely able to handle the meta.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Surprisingly, this fan favourite girl has most of her cards available in Normal/Rare! This means that a somewhat functional albeit weaker Sky Striker strategy is viable in the N/R format. There is no Engage, Kagari, Shizuku, Widow Anchor, Zeke, and Hornet Drones, but these ladies can still pack quite a punch!  The usual Sky Striker strategy is used - wear down your opponent with net gain trades using spell cards to win in a drawn out grind game. 6 potent equip spells are in the deck to allow the Strikers to beat down your opponent's monsters.  The Extra Deck Strikers only feature 3 Hayate and Kaina. The rest are rank 4 toolbox and generic link monsters.  And remember... RAYE IS BAYE!!!

Of course, Beetrooper doesn't exist in Master Duel but many of the cards used in the deck are available for use in <strong>Event N/R</strong>. Among them, the <strong>Battlewasp archetype</strong> and the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> engine stand out, which has <strong>synergy with Normal Insect monsters</strong>, allowing you to play fun games throughout the duel. The main idea of ​​the deck is focused on taking <strong>advantage of the floating effects of the main Insect monsters</strong> of the deck that even if they are destroyed or leave the field they <strong>give you an advantage</strong> in the form of Special Summoning from the Deck or adding Insects to the hand. These cards are:  <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Sting the Poison"">Battlewasp - Sting the Poison</a>, basically it is a <strong>""Stratos""</strong> from the <strong>Battlewasp archetype</strong> and normally you will add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand which is a great <strong>Follow Up</strong> for your next turn by Special Summoning <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> back to the field and <strong>allow you Synchro plays</strong> such as SYNCHRO-6 <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a>. If you already have the Arbalest in your hand you can add 1 of the <strong>Battlewasp Extenders</strong> in place like <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> or <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> so they enter the field allowing you to make Synchro plays like the SYNCHRO-5 <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> or some LINK-2 like <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a>. The <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> and <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> Extenders also have field effects, with the <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> dealing <strong>200 damage</strong> to the opponent and the <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> being able to do <strong>2 Attacks during the Battle Phase</strong> which means inflicting 2000 damage per battle. (Remember that Twinbow the Attacker <strong>locks you into Insects for the rest of the turn</strong> if you Special Summon it by its own effect).  - <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>, this is one of my favorite Insect monsters because if it is <strong>sent to the GY</strong> you will be able to <strong>add a Level 4 Insect to your hand</strong>, and if you add a <strong>Normal Monster</strong> with this effect, you can Special Summon it. and <strong>destroy a Monster on the field with ATK equal to or greater than that of the Normal monster</strong>. That is, in this deck, he will either add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand that as I said is a <strong>great Follow Up</strong> to be your Normal Summon or it will be <strong>an interaction</strong> with the opponent by adding you to Vanilla <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;"">Shiny Black ""C""</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;&quot;&gt;Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Squadder""> Squadder</a> that will enter the field and <strong>destroy an opponent's monster with 2k ATK or more without targeting</strong>. It happens a lot that you set <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> face-down and the opponent destroys him in battle and you use your interaction effect by bringing Vanilla from the deck and destroying his monster by taking him by surprise because no one expects that to happen. (Detail that you have to pay attention is that he <strong>can destroy your monsters too</strong>, so in <strong>Master Duel</strong> if the opponent doesn't have a monster that can be destroyed but the <strong>message to destroy a monster on the field appears, you click No</strong> because what will happen would be to destroy your own monster).  - <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> besides being a <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> of the Small Insects in Normal Summon (Special Summon doesn't work), it has <strong>excellent Floating effect</strong> when destroyed by an opponent's card you <strong>Special Summon a Battlewasp Monster straight from the Deck</strong> which is very beneficial. So even if your opponent negates his Normal Summon effect with <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> you can go into the battle phase and <strong>crash the Arbalest into an opponent's monster</strong> just to Special Summon <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> straight from the deck which will add another Battlewasp Monster on top of that to the hand.  Just by knowing what the 3 main monsters in the Main Deck do, you can see why the deck works: You can have <strong>plays every turn when Looping your own monsters</strong>, for example: <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> Add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> and Arbalest the Rapidfire Reborn Sting the Poison that can add you another Arbalest the Rapidfire so the Loop never ends. Same goes for <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> where Gokipole Add Arbalest and Arbalest Reborn Gokipole and <strong>did all the Resource Loop again</strong>.  - Finally, speaking of <strong>Floating effects</strong>, we have the excellent Field Spell <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> that whenever any monster you control is destroyed by an opponent's card effect, you can <strong>Special Summon a Normal Insect from your GY</strong>, which in this case will always be <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a>. But <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> main function is its <strong>Damage Calculation effect</strong> which allows you to avoid taking battle damage (either you or your opponent) to <strong>send a Level 4 or lower Insect from your Deck to the GY</strong>. Then we can send the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> that will activate its effect of adding an Insect to the hand that you will choose if it will be <strong>Follow Up</strong> through <a data-name=""Arbalest"">Arbalest</a> or it will be <strong>interaction</strong> through Vanilla or even more interesting is to send the <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> because like you sent a Normal Monster by the effect of <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> you will simply be able to <strong>Special Summon any number of copies of it to the field</strong> of your hand, Deck and/or GY which means having 3 <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> on the field to attack with them and do a lot of damage and in Main Phase 2 make Synchro, Xyz or Link plays.  Talking about the tech cards used in the deck: <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a> and <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> <strong>don't have such a high cost</strong> in this deck because both <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> are good discards since with <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> you reborn Vanilla from GY and <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> becomes a Search from <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> or Vanilla to enter the field and destroy an opponent's monster. So basically you can <strong>still get value out of your Monsters even after discarding them</strong> to the GY even if you discard a Battlewasp as you can use <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> to bring <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> back to the field and still get a Search for free.  Speaking of <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a>, it allows you to make very strong plays, especially in the Grind Game, such as giving Reborn from <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> that adds <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> and as you didn't spend your Normal Summon you still bring the Arbalest to the field that goes give you Reborn from another GY Insect and in the end with <strong>just one card you managed to bring three Monsters to the field</strong> to make plays mainly from Synchro and Xyz RANK-3. On top of that <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> has an excellent effect on the GY of targeting an Insect you control like <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> and it <strong>cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects until the end of the opponent's turn, including your cards</strong>. So even if you use <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> you will still have the monster protected.  <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> is very valuable in this deck because you will continue to generate an advantage by destroying monsters like <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> for example, so losing cards on the field is not that big of a problem for you. <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> has the versatility of being able to destroy both Monsters or Spells/Traps too because if the opponent has a monster with <strong>1700ATK or less</strong> you send the <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a> to the GY instead of the <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a> and it has GY effect banish yourself to <strong>target and destroy a Spell/Trap</strong> on the field. So even not using <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> you still have 6 Spell Trap outs in the deck which are 3 <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>. <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> I'm just using it to receive rewards of causing Burn on the opponent, you could be using <a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a> instead for example it's a card that does the <strong>same role as Torrential Tribute</strong> but only for <strong>Face-Up monsters</strong> so if you have a monster Face-Down and your opponent has 3 Monsters Face-Up you use Needle Ceiling and destroy all their monsters but keep your monster on the field.  The main Extra Deck Monsters are the Synchro Battlewasp <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> and <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a>, being Azusa a card that has a <strong>good effect of causing Burn</strong> to the opponent but the main factor is <strong>that it is Tuner</strong> so if you use <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> + <strong>any Lv3</strong> Monster to make it and have <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> on the field you use both to make <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> which is the <strong>deck's win condition</strong> because it basically takes away <strong>any monster with 5k or less ATK</strong> in battle as it cuts ATK of the opponent's monster in half which means <strong>trigger the effect</strong> of <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> to <strong>return to the field from GY</strong> and that way you have both Synchro of the archetype on the field to control the game.  <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> is such a <strong>good Boss Monster in this format</strong> that for example there was an Infinitrack Gadget Train player who did turn 1 the <a data-name=""Ravenous Tarantula"">Ravenous Tarantula</a> and on top did <a data-name=""Pain Gainer"">Pain Gainer</a>, followed by The <a data-name=""Seven Sins"">Seven Sins</a> which means ending up with a <strong>4k ATK monster with 4 materials and protection against destruction</strong> when detach 2 Materials. But with only 1 <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> <strong>and 1 Extender</strong> I dealt with this boss monster because I added <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand (Follow Up) and brought <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> to the field and set <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> and on his turn if he gave summon any monster I would activate <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> and chain <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> to <strong>Tribute Pin the Bullseye</strong> and <strong>negate the effects of Seven Sins</strong> and that way he would <strong>lose protection from destruction</strong> and the entire field would be cleared. My opponent was smart and decided to go into the battle phase to force negate the Sting the Poison I used and then decided to spend the turn playing around Torrential Tribute. But since I had <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> from Follow Up I simply Normal Summoned it and reborn <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> which added <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> to enter the field to be Sting the Poison's tribute to <strong>negate</strong> <a data-name=""Seven Sins"">Seven Sins</a> again and this time I didn't even need to use Torrential Tribute once because it was just <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> that I took it out in the Battle Phase by cutting its ATK in half. That is, the <strong>deck has outs within the engine itself for practically all boss monsters of this format</strong>, either negating their effects and destroying them with the traps used or taking them out in battle.  About the Extra Deck's Link Monsters, <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a> is very good in this deck because you <strong>easily put two monsters on the field</strong> and often they are of levels that don't allow you to Synchro or Xyz Summon so what's left is for you to use them to do it this Codebreaker that has <a data-name=""absurd 2300ATK"">absurd 2300ATK</a> which is very high for a Link-2 monster and its main factor besides ATK is that it has <strong>excellent Floating effect if the opponent destroys it either by card effect or by battle it will return to the field in the End Phase</strong>. And this is relevant because not only does it <strong>keep card advantage but as it leaves the Extra Monster Zone</strong> you can return it to one of the columns of the Extra Monster Zone that are not occupied and on your turn do the <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a> pointing at it which means that the opponent <strong>can't target the Shinobi for attacks</strong> so it's a card that stays on the field for a long time until you come back into play. Shinobi as well as <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> has the function of <strong>punishing players who place their monsters in the wrong zones</strong> so you can take advantage of that.  The <a data-name=""Number 20: Giga-Brilliant"">Number 20: Giga-Brilliant</a> and <a data-name=""Number 70: Malevolent Sin"">Number 70: Malevolent Sin</a> as they are Insect-type Xyz monsters can be used as material to make the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top which in addition to good ATK status has an excellent effect of <strong>shuffle a monster in opponent's defense position into deck</strong> and can even <strong>attach Insects from your GY</strong> to it to keep using this effect again. Just be careful that as you need to <strong>detach 2 Xyz materials to summon</strong> the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top if you use the effect of one of these Xyz you won't be able to do the Corebage on top later.  <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a> is a utility card that <strong>survives on the field for several turns</strong> as it cannot be targeted by cards and still protects itself from destruction including your cards like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> while <strong>giving you 500LP every Standby Phase</strong>. And when the opponent finally takes him out of the field you use his effect to return him and two level3 monsters to the deck <strong>recycling their cards</strong> to do it again if necessary. <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a> and <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> are the best possible interactions to do in this N/R format. <a data-name=""Gossip Shadow"">Gossip Shadow</a> is a <strong>monster negate</strong> as the effect makes <strong>both players draw 1 card</strong> and <a data-name=""Mech Beast Grampulse"">Mech Beast Grampulse</a> is a <strong>Spell/Trap pop every turn</strong>.  Disregard the Side Deck, they are just examples of cards that you can test in the main deck.  &nbsp;"

Yes. They're actually fun to play, test them before you judge me.  Anyway, presenting Rikka Aromages.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  This deck is surprisingly good enough in a slower format like the N/R rarity festival, because not only is it a control deck that utilizes your Aroma Spells/Traps for disruption, it can also combo out of nowhere and OTK with Xyz plays through your Rikka monsters. It also does not give a fuck about Kaijus, which is absolutely great, for the reasons that will be explained later. I'll go further in details in the list.  <strong>The main deck:</strong>  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>• The Rikka monsters (<a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore</a>, <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop</a>, <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica</a>, <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Petal</a>)</strong> - <span>Your main combo engine. They all do something about Tributing and in response to a Plant monster getting Tributed in any way, shape, or form. These are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore </a>- <span>A hand trap that negates the effects of your opponent's monsters' activated effects. It can also Special Summon herself from the GY by Tributing any Plant monster but banishes herself when she leaves the field.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop </a>- <span>Your main combo starter. You're usually starting with either her and either Hellebore or Erica. Special Summons herself and 1 other Plant monster in your hand at a cost of Tributing a Plant monster. She also helps you with the Xyz plays by modulating the levels of all Plant monsters you currently control depending on the target's Level.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica </a>- <span>The Level 6 monster that you'll mostly be using for combos, and also the one you're gonna be searching the most with Petal. She's also a hand trap that boosts a battling Plant monster's ATK/DEF by Tributing herself, and like Hellebore, can also summon herself from the GY with the same said stipulations.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula </a>- <span>Your extender of the deck. Special Summons herself when a Plant monster you control is Tributed by any means (which will be relevant soon), and can also modulate the Levels of your two targeted Plant monsters by increasing their Levels by 2.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Petal</a> - <span>Your main searcher of the deck. She searches any of your Rikka monsters during the Main Phase, except a copy of herself, and either adds it to your hand or sends it to the GY. She can also Special Summon herself from your GY during your opponent's End Phase, if you control no monsters, or all monsters you control are Plants.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Aroma monsters (<a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Angelica"">Angelica</a>)</strong> - <span>Your main control engine. If you play Duel Links, you most likely already know what they do but regardless, these are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a> - <span>Your game ender. If your LP is higher than your opponent, he grants all Plant monsters you control piercing, also if you gain LP while he's on the field, he gains 1000 ATK and DEF until the end of your opponent's next turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Marjoram</a> - <span>Your GY disruption. If your LP is higher than your opponent, she grants you battle damage protection from attacks involving your Plant monsters, also if you gain LP while she's on the field, she can banish cards in your opponent's GY, up to the number of Aroma monsters you currently control.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a> - <span>Your field disruption. If your LP is higher than your opponent, she grants your Plant monsters an <a data-name=""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"">Armades</a> effect but only for monsters, also if you gain LP while she's on the field, she can change the battle position of 1 monster on the field. This is not a hard once per turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Angelica"">Angelica</a> - <span>Your main Tuner, if you ever feel like Synchro Summoning, but more importantly, she's a hand trap that can discard herself as a Quick Effect to gain LP equal to a targeted Aroma monster's ATK in the GY. She can also Special Summon herself from the GY if your LP is higher than your opponent's and control an Aroma monster, but banishes herself when she leaves the field.</span></li> </ol> <strong>Spells</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - <span>Backrow removal. Could also be <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a> if you wanna game harder.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aroma Garden"">Aroma Garden</a></strong> - <span>The archetypal Field Spell, at least for the Aromas. Its effect can be used to gain 500 LP and boost the ATK and DEF of all monsters you control by 500, if you control an Aroma monster, even if it leaves the field. Also, it heals you for 1000 LP when an Aroma monster is destroyed by battle or card effect, and this effect is not once per turn, which we will be abusing most of the time through our interactions.</span>  <strong>Traps</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a></strong> - <span>Targets and destroys a card your opponent controls for a cost of Tributing, which is the most important part about this card, since it triggers our Rikka monsters' effects.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> - <span>Your 3-in-1 interruption. Just hover over the highlighted name to read, since they're too long lmao. Also, the main reason why most if not all of our Extra Deck monsters are Plant monsters.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dried Winds"">Dried Winds</a></strong> - <span>Destroys an opponent's monster upon gaining LP, also allows you to pay LP if your LP is at least 3000 LP higher than your opponent's to destroy all of their monsters whose total ATK is less than or equal the amount paid.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Humid Winds"">Humid Winds</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher, at a cost of paying 1000 LP, also allows you to gain 500 LP if your LP is lower than your opponent's.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a></strong> - <span>An aggressive Counter Trap, which can be used in response to a potential Summon of an opponent's problematic monster at a cost of Tributing 1 monster, which makes it even better.</span>  <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  You'll notice that most if not all of these cards are Plant monsters since they're recyclable by <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>, although, one could obviously adjust the ratios of each card however much they see fit. I'm just saying.  The only Link monsters  <strong>• The Sunavalons (<a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Dryas</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryades"">Dryades</a>)</strong> - <span>There's no reason not to play these cards, especially since we're playing all Plant monsters.</span>  The Xyz monsters  <strong>• <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a></strong> - <span>Your Rikka boss monster, kinda, since she's the easiest to bring out turn one. She's a Rank 6 Plant Xyz monster that has an effect to detach an Xyz material when a monster(s) is Tributed and Special Summons a monster in either GY, but negating its effects, also makes it so that it is treated as a Plant. She also has a card effect destruction protection by Tributing 1 Plant monster from your hand or field as a replacement, but only once per turn.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Number 50: Blackship of Corn"">Number 50: Blackship of Corn</a></strong> - <span>A Rank 4 Plant Xyz monster that allows you to send a monster your opponent controls to the GY and inflict 1000 damage to your opponent, so long as it can be targeted.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Number 87: Queen of the Night"">Number 87: Queen of the Night</a></strong> - <span>Your ACTUAL boss monster, I think, since she's got the arguably best effects of all your Extra Deck monsters, while also having the best stats. She's a Rank 8 Plant Xyz monster that has a once per turn Quick Effect that can be one of the three effects in selection. Hover over her name to see the full details.</span>  The Synchro monsters  <strong>• <a data-name=""Periallis, Empress of Blossoms"">Periallis, Empress of Blossoms</a></strong> - <span>She's a Level 7 Plant Synchro monster that can once per turn Special Summon any Level 5 or higher Plant monster from your hand or GY. She also gets her ATK boosted by 400 for each Plant monster you control, except herself. This effect actually applies for both of its copies if you have two or three of her.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Splendid Rose"">Splendid Rose</a></strong> - <span>She's a Level 6 Plant Synchro monster that can be used to get over some problematic high ATK monsters that can be targeted, at a cost of banishing a Plant monster from your GY. She also has an effect that enables her to attack twice, at the same cost as stated but also halving her ATK until the end of the turn which may or may not come up.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Queen of Thorns"">Queen of Thorns</a></strong> - <span>Your main floodgate. She's a Level 6 Plant Synchro monster that makes it so that each player must pay 1000 LP for each monster Normal or Special Summoned from their hand, except for Plant-type monsters. Obviously, this will never be a downside for us.</span>  <strong>The side deck</strong>  More optional cards, as per usual.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Fairy Archer Ingunar"">Fairy Archer Ingunar</a></strong> - <span>A Level 6 Plant monster that could be a great extender if you wanna go more heavy on the Rikka engine for more Rank 6 plays.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""World Carrotweight Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a></strong> - <span>Always a good one of extender from the GY that can also set up your GY for Plant decks.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Evilswarm Mandragora"">Evilswarm Mandragora</a></strong> - <span>A Level 4 Cyber Dragon for Plants, commonly seen in Rank 4 toolbox decks back in the day.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aromage Cananga"">Aromage Cananga</a></strong> - <span>A Level 3 Plant monster that can be used as coverage for more Spell/Trap disruption by bouncing that card to the hand, also has an effect that makes it so all your opponent's monsters lose 500 ATK and DEF if your LP is higher than theirs.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aromage Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a></strong> - <span>A Level 1 Plant monster that's a good extender if you wanna go more heavy on the Aromage engine for more Synchro plays, since it has an effect that it can make a non-Tuner Plant monster a Tuner if you gain LP. It also makes you gain LP upon getting sent to the GY by any means.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aroma Jar"">Aroma Jar</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a> that makes you gain LP during the End Phase. Great for a more stall dedicated strategy.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong> - <span>Free Link 2 on board while burning your opponent, and more importantly, it Tributes for cost.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a></strong> - <span>Tribute either your Hellebore or Snowdrop; Draw 2 cards. It's not once per turn.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Share the Pain"">Share the Pain</a></strong> - <span>A non-targeting, non-destruction removal, that also Tributes for cost. Bro...</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a></strong> - <span>A decent combat trick that allows you to either switch a monster's battle position, OR better yet, Tribute a monster for cost to take control of an opponent's monster until the End Phase, so long as it can be targeted.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Wall of Thorns"">Wall of Thorns</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> for Plants.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Spiritual Water Art - Aoi"">Spiritual Water Art - Aoi</a></strong> - <span>This is unironically good with this deck, since most of our main deck monsters are WATER monsters, and the best part is as per usual, it's a <a data-name=""Confiscation"">Confiscation</a> that Tributes for cost.</span>  <strong>• The utility Paleos (<a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Canadia</a>)</strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">MST</a>, a <a data-name=""Dark Core"">Dark Core</a>, and a <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a>, respectively. Also works with Spiritual Water Art - Aoi, funny enough.</span>  Honorable mentions are the usual staples such as <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a>, and many more.  <strong>Final thoughts</strong>  This deck is actually fun to play. It does not require a lot of negates to interact with and disrupt your opponent. Even though it can easily be as aggressive as much as you want it to be at any point, it's also not hard to just go back into the defensive whenever something goes wrong, but since you're still utilizing some control cards, you still need to keep constant track of your resources. In fact, I've had so much fun playing this deck that I might actually build this in MD in the future and test more versions of Rikka as a more consistent and coherent strategy, because I just love building under explored and underestimated archetypes. But I gotta say, there will be awkward hands that won't be straightforward to play, so you just gotta be mindful of making plays with them. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

The deck name ""Heresy"" is from a youtuber named Hardleg Gaming and the build is inspired by several handful of other Witchcrafter+Dogmatika builds I was able to find online.  The deck utilizes the Witchcrafter Engine, mainly, and is heavily reliant on tributing themselves in order to search out their spell cards as well as summon each other with very little effort. Because they resolve off-field when tributing themselves you get to play with cards like Psy-Frame Gamma when your opponent attempts to stop any of your effects with Ash Blossom.  Because all of the Witchcrafter spells add themselves back into your hand this allows for you to also play cards like Different Dimension Reincarnation, Phoenix Wind Blast, and Paleozoic Dinomischus if you wish.  &nbsp;  Highly recommended for players that aren't looking for anything hyper aggressive or spending ten minutes comboing off.  &nbsp;  **EDIT: Removed one of my Charmers from ED that aren't as common of an element for an additional Titaniklad.

But best later than never I guess. So, back to the memes we go.  Recently discovering the existence of Numbers Evaille from the recent article here, which completely flew over my radar, I had a thought on how to use it as an engine. Basically, Seven Sins turbo. And what deck loves banishing? Well you clicked on this so you know. This might just be my memiest (that a word?) deck this far, apart from the Gustkraken loops I keep to myself, so grab a seat and get comfy, cuz this is about to get real. Shout outs to Therarely and Alice_YGO for making me entertain the idea of creating this abomination.  To explain the use of each card in the Deck: <ul>  	<li>Lord of the Heavenly Prison: Okay, this deck is more on the trap heavy side, so a beefy body while protecting your stuff doesn't hurt. Helps with otk and adds protection.</li>  	<li>Gizmek Orochi: A staple in Gren Maju decks, this fella banishes to summon itself and it even has a neat effect on field. Only a fool would run less than 3. Great discard fodder for astraltopia but that is another story.</li>  	<li>Dimension Shifter: Banish, banish and banish some more. Yeah it should be blindly obvious at this point.</li>  	<li>Necroface: If gets to banish then gren become stronk. Simple as that. Can even recycle your extra deck from cards like prosperity if need be.</li>  	<li>Astraltopia: The searcher for the engine. Unfortunately will use your NS but it is worth it. Discard Orochi if possible.</li>  	<li>Gren Maju Da Eiza: The boi himself, the heart and soul of this deck. NS after banishing tons of cards and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Eater of Millions: Banish for boi that removes by banishing. Need I explain why this is good?</li>  	<li>Numbers Evaille: Use this to summon the Seven Sins. Useless going first and against decks like monarchs, but you can change your side deck accordingly. Make sure to summon Orochi first before activating.</li>  	<li>Reinforcement of the Army: The searcher for the searcher, allowing essentially seven copies of Evaille.</li>  	<li>Pot of Desires: You would play three if possible but I guess those days are past us. Draw power and banish, what more do you want?</li>  	<li>Gold Sarcophagus: Banish Necroface, give chonk to Maju.</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity: Banish your ED for add power, all in all great.</li>  	<li>Storming Mirror Force: ""Lol no"" your opponent's monsters. With Heavenly Prison, this becomes quite threatening.</li>  	<li>Torrential Tribute: Last ditch move. If you have only Orochi, not that much. And with macro cosmos this becomes even better.</li>  	<li>Macro Cosmos: Steroids for the deck what else can I say?</li>  	<li>Solemn Strike and Judgement: Negates for rubbing insult to injury or for when you don't manage to otk.</li> </ul> The Extra Deck doesn't need that much analysing cuz it boils down to Seven Sins turbo. Select everything else and voila. A 4-material nuke with protection and a big chonk. 3 nukes at best, none at worst.  The side deck is moreso some S/T removal since the deck struggles with that and an alternative, more controllish engine with Harmonizer Gradielle for extra stalling until you stack up enough banished cards to finish your opponent in one blow.  Aaaaand that is it! As always, hope you like the deck, this is moi signing out. And remember, memes are the DNA of the soul."

It is a blind going second Mekk-knight deck that has a side deck for boarding into going first with mainly an Orcust focus, the cost of this deck currently is about 220$, but it can be made for around 160$ if you replace 3 evenly matched with 3 Raigeki. I made this deck because I wanted a somewhat budget deck to play in the TCG after I found that I have a locals nearby. I have been playing Mekk-knights on master duel for about 2 months now, so I think this is the deck I would want to take to a locals. The other decks I play are a bit too complicated for me to play outside of a simulator or are much too expensive.  The side deck is to board out of all the going second cards for backrow and Scraps which act as Orcust starters. (manly board; Pankratops, 3 Evenly matched, 3 Dark ruler, 3 Gameciel, Mekk-knight red, Mekk-knight yellow, 1 Mekk-knight blue, 1 Mekk-knight indigo, and 1 World legacy memories, for everything in the side deck).  The main starters are Mekk-knight purple nightfall, Girsu and Mekk-knight blue sky. World legacy memories is a good starter if you are going second, but be careful as this card locks you into Mekk-knights, which will stop you from making Linkuriboh, Almiraj or summon World legacy tokens with Girsu's effect, which are used to create a column."

After testing out a Rokket Engine and a Metalfoes engine I landed on Scraps which have been the most profitable with working with the xenolocking of Unchained. <ul>  	<li>You only get locked into Fiend types if you use the effects of the Unchained Twins Aruha and Rakea. So Sarama is a great card if you have a way to dump one of the other twins from your deck/hand right away.</li>  	<li>Scrap Raptor can give you super easy access to Wyvern or 1 of the synchros. (Personal favorite of mine is using Scrap Twin Dragon to destroy one of my small Unchained or one of the set Spell/Traps, just for a double bounce of 2 cards.</li>  	<li>The Spell lineup can be mildly cloggly, so the ratios can be altered pretty easily.</li>  	<li>If you are able to end your combos on the xenolocking small Twins you only have to worry if you dont need to go into Accesscode Talker in that moment.</li> </ul>"

With these monsters you can then link off into traffic ghost and then if you have two more effect monsters you can summon Codebreaker Virus Swordsman (make sure you summon Virus Swordsman directly beneath traffic ghost) who will summon Codebreaker Zero-Day, with these you can then link off into Virus Berserker who will re-summon your two codebreakers whilst being able to destroy up to two spells and traps. Then with the two codebreakers you have just summoned, you want to use Traffic Ghost and Zero-Day to make a Rasterliger which can gain attack equal to a link monsters attack that's in either player's graveyard. So for example if your opponent has a Tri-Brigade Shuraig in their grave, you can then make Rasterliger gain 3000ATK making it have 5000ATK, meaning by the end of your turn you could have up to over 10000 damage on your field giving you more than enough to OTK your opponent.  Use cards like Dust Knight to put Gokipole in the grave to add a normal insect which you can then special summon and destroy a monster  Use Giant Rat to special summon any monster you might need with 1500ATK or less  Use Baobaboon to fix your hand so you have the cards you need (it's also a great way to put Codebreaker Zero Day on the bottom of your deck to stop you from bricking as you want it in your deck) and to also have multiple effect monsters on the field to help with your link summons  If you wanted to replace any cards then you could replace or even remove cards Like:Doom Dozer which can be replaced with something like Super Armored Robot Armed Black Iron ""C"", you can replace Man-Eater Bug with one of the Swarm Flip Monsters, you can replace Gigantes with Aztekipede, the Worm Warrior and then the back row can be anything you want as well as the XYZ monsters used in the Deck.  &nbsp;"

My personal favorite deck of all time. I've used Junk Stardust, Pend Magician / Z-ARC, Galaxy-Eyes, Elemental Heroes, Utopia, and Slime / God Card decks, and nothing so far tops this one in terms of fun for me. The combos are pretty simple and mostly revolve around getting Crimson Resonator out so you can get Supernova out on turn 1. Summon Crimson as the first monster so you can special summon it, and summon whatever Level 4 you have (preferably Wildwind so you still have a normal summon, but any of em work), go into Red Rising Dragon, use its effect, summon 2 more Resonators and go into Supernova. I'd recommend summoning Mirror Resonator and Creation Resonator so you can use Mirror Resonators effect in the future, or use it for plays with Chaos Ruler or Red Risings second effect. If Crimson gets negated, that's fine too, just go into Chaos Ruler and excavate the top 5 cards, and hopefully, that'll give you a counter play if you don't have a potential one in your hand already.  The main Extra Deck priorities are Red Rising, Chaos Ruler, Abyss, and Supernova. Red Rising is what allows most of the plays in the deck. Abyss is a once-per-turn Quick Effect negate and can summon more Resonators. Supernova can banish the opponents' entire field should they use a monster effect, and if they negate that, it still has a ton of ATK, getting 500 for each Resonator in the GY (which is a lot if you use combos correctly). Other cards, such as Samsara or Ancient Pixie, are there to fill space in case you don't get levels matching up to 6 or 8 with monsters you have in your hand (for example, if you only have Creation and Wildwind). Samsara is a good general defensive option, and Ancient Pixie has some very rare potential should you have Tilted Try up on the field. If you don't want to use Ancient Pixie, replace it with Exploder Dragonwing. Honestly, you could replace stuff like Galaxy Cyclone or Tilted Try with more meta cards, like Solemn Judgement / Called by the Grave / Forbidden Droplet, I just like using them because Skull Meister can function as a searchable but slightly weaker version of Called by the Grave, and I have a Royal Tilted Try (and it gives Ancient Pixie actual functionality), so I just like running it.  The main deck mostly consists of Resonators (Tuners) and 4* cards with search potential (WotBF, Wildwind, Stygian Street Patrol). Ascator is there in case you get a brick hand and only have him, so you can go into Chaos Ruler and potentially make a comeback. Ash Blossom and Maxx C are there just as basic hand traps. Red Reign is useful should you only have one Synchro on the field, or if you want to use it mid-turn before you start summoning other cards. Chain and Mirror are mostly there for low-level Resonator spam and for Chaos Ruler plays.  For an example of gameplay: https://youtu.be/0Yh9rMZ4hxA"

But before talking about what has changed in the decklist, first I will say what for me is already clear that is perfect in the deck: - the <strong>Impcantation engine's ratio</strong> is ideal for Megalith. - Engine spells and traps are also what you need to play. - The number of main deck tech cards is 10 cards: <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>, <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. I would only put a <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> from main deck if I knew what I was facing in ranked but since it's <strong>singles games</strong> I don't mind getting lost because my opponent won on the dice and flip <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, I'm going straight to the next game. In a Master Duel tournament, there are ways to prevent the best players from losing because of stupid cards that exist in the game: there are several Swiss format rounds so that this variance of going second decreases and in the top cut there is an improvised side deck so that the matches are better than 3 and that way you will destroy any deck that is really good by going first to put outs against the stupid cards those decks use.  What really changed my theory about were the following cards:  Overall <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> makes your Megalith engine plays much better in terms of <strong>End Board and Follow Up</strong> and that's why I started using it in place of the third <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and the consistency remains impeccable. Using <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> allows you to play around <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in Megalith Phul because you use Phul eff and bring <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> who adds <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to the hand and with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> to the field and use Och and Ophiel to bring Bethor to the field at the same time as <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> adds Megalith Phul to the hand for example. Not to mention that Megalith Och <strong>counts as 1 more pop</strong> for Bethor in his standard deck play. It only has <strong>conflicts with plays involving Benten</strong> and <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> that I will talk about in detail below.  One thing I noticed a lot about the deck's End Boards was the fragility they had for cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> destroying Spell/Trap like <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. So I decided to test the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> on the deck and the results were excellent. It is a <strong>negate of Spell/Trap when discarding Fairy monster</strong> from the hand and it will always be done in the plays involving <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> that will be the discard to activate its effect. That way you can negate any <strong>power spell that your opponent activates</strong> and in modern Yugioh there are several decks that can only develop a good play when resolving power spells like <a data-name=""Sky Striker"">Sky Striker</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked"">Invoked</a> Shaddoll Dogmatika. And your opponent will think twice before wanting to take the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> out of the field because if it is <strong>sent to the GY</strong> because of an opponent's card (including being used as a fusion material for <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>) you <strong>add 2 Ritual cards</strong> of GY for the hand. Seen because I use <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> in the deck, just know that plays involving making him <strong>should access Benten back to the hand</strong> and so you shouldn't add <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> but the <strong>second Megalith Hagith</strong> already that <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> will be used exclusively to add <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> back to the hand to have <strong>spell/trap negate</strong> and not the Hagith that would be needed to access Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. This will be clear in the combos.  Now I'll talk about <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> because my theory about him being worse than <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> for this deck has changed: What I thought was a crucial difference for <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> to be better than <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> in the deck is the fact that it gives you <strong>access to Synchro moves</strong> and can send <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> to the GY and be an interaction but I ended up realizing that for o Megalith you gain a lot of value by having a <strong>Level 4 Monster on the field</strong> to make <strong>XYZ RANK-4 moves</strong> and that using <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> means decreasing the number of Xyz and Link monsters to put <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and other Synchro Monsters which doesn't give you the same <strong>versatility that the current Extra Deck allows</strong> you to mainly go second to break the field. Not to mention that if <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is denied it will continue to be Level 4 different from <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> which will <strong>not gain any Level</strong> so even Synchro moves you expected to make with her will not be possible.  Finally, what I like most about <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is that it allows you to access <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> even if it is not a ROCK Type Monster and EARTH Attribute because you will <strong>always use it as Xyz Material</strong> from <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> that will add <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> to the hand and then using it and another Megalith on your field to do the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> and have <strong>Spell/Trap negate</strong>. So one of the main moves of the deck is <strong>only possible by using Manju</strong> instead of <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>. So in this Megalith build <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> not only serves to add a Normal Summon to the hand but also becomes a Spell/Trap Negate, the same goes for <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> which is no longer just a card to add Nibiru to the hand, it is needed to make the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// // //////////////////////////////////////////////// //<strong>COMBOS:</strong>  Put the continuation of the link on the website: <strong>duelingbook</strong> after <strong>.com/</strong>  <strong>Combo 1: (Chalislime + Discard) + Hagith/Ophiel (Full Combo)</strong> (example with Ophiel)  replay?id=813757-37517621  Gamestate: Phul(Lv4) + Herald of Mirage Lights + Portal + Emergence /in Hand: Phaleg + Benten + Nibiru /in GY: Inception + Chalislime Opponent's Turn:  - You have the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> Spell/Trap Negate (even if you discard Benten it's no problem because just activate <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and give Hagith Reborn and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> eff Add Benten to Hand). - It also has <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> eff tribute itself and <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> Ritual <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from Deck and Bethor eff cl1 and Benten eff cl2 Add Manju(Follow Up). - There's <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> if all goes wrong to tribute the entire field against Combo decks. - You had a <strong>Plus 5</strong> without counting the two cards in your starting hand that you didn't even need to use.  /////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 2: Chalislime + Inception</strong>  This is a combo that at first you might <strong>think is very specific to happen but actually not</strong> because let's assume you have brick and just opened it with <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> moves. You add <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> to the hand and use the effect by discarding any other card from the hand and Special Summoning <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> from the deck to add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and on <strong>your next turn you will be able to do this combo</strong> because the first monster you give Special Summon doesn't matter so even if you've already spent Candoll just Special Summon <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> instead and the result will be the same. In short this is the <strong>closest to 1 Card Combo from the deck but you need 2 turns to do it</strong>.  replay?id=813757-37518128  Gamestate: RANK-4 Gallant Granite + Portal + Emergence /in Hand: Nibiru /in GY: Phul + Och + Inception + Chalislime  /////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 3: Hagith/Ophiel + Unformed</strong>  replay?id=813757-37518826 You could also bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> straight with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and add <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> with <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and tribute Ophiel and Hagith to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> out of the deck but this time you <strong>would have 3 pops</strong>.

Expect to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> out to the field to use the <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> because otherwise you will <strong>have one less Pop</strong>.  <strong>Megalith's Quick effects to Ritual Summon</strong> are still the best ways to <strong>play around interactions that target or destroy your monsters</strong> because you trigger the effects of <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a>, or <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> in a chain to <strong>get rid of the monster</strong> that would be targeted by cards or destroyed by card effects and <strong>maintain advantage of monsters on the field</strong> and breath to continue playing after interactions. That's why <strong>going second</strong> is very important to know how to use your <strong>Starters and Extenders</strong> to build the final board even with several opponent interactions as you always want to access <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> while dealing with the opponent's threats on the way or part of them because <strong>Megalith has the property to play on the opponent's turn</strong> so what you can't handle on your turn you leave to resolve on the opponent's turn.  <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is so absurd that you can use it to <strong>Ritual Summon itself from your Deck</strong>. This is good for example using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> on the opponent's turn and Reborn Phul and eff Ritual <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> from Deck and eff Add <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> to Hand per example and that way you get a <strong>Follow Up</strong>. Of course, you only do this if you're <strong>sure the interactions you had were enough to stop the opponent's turn</strong> and you can use <strong>Megalith Phul to add Follow Up</strong> to the hand instead of bringing in <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a>. Interaction <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: If you don't have good Follow Ups because you didn't open well but you have <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and Megalith Phul on the field you can <strong>first wait for the opponent to play to give Nibiru</strong> and Tribute the whole field and if he stops the turn after Nibiru for not having plays you simply Reborn Megalith Phul and make <strong>Phul eff to tribute himself and bring another Phul from the deck to add a Ritual to the hand</strong> and have excellent follow ups, the fact is that using <strong>Megalith Phul eff after Nibiru is much better</strong> than first Phul because it gives you more <strong>versatility on what to bring to the field with Megalith Phul</strong>, remember that you will be able to use Nibiru itself on the field to Special Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from the Deck if needed. It is only recommended to use Megalith Phul eff first if the opponent's deck is very oppressive which happens with some decks like <a data-name=""Adamancipator"">Adamancipator</a> which is absurd with <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> so try to stop his plays as soon as possible.  <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> trigger effect even if your <strong>opponent Special Summons a Megalith monster</strong> having applications in <strong>Mirror Match</strong> and <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> first eff of taking <strong>ATK from opponent's monsters</strong> is excellent in <strong>Mirror Match</strong> as well.  My opinion on using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> hasn't changed, in fact I'm much more convinced of how good it is in the deck, having many applications in terms of making your <strong>End Board resilient and recycling your monsters every turn</strong> allowing for <strong>RANK-4 or LINK plays</strong> monsters.  <strong>Biggest MISSPLAY</strong> I've ever committed when using the deck: If you spend the turn with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> on the field and <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> in hand, you always prevent the opponent from <strong>denying Megalith Phul</strong> and just give him chances to deny some card of yours in the summon of the <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> because for example if you chain <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> to an <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> that will bring <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> it is <strong>much better than waiting for the Mechaba</strong> to enter the field for the following reasons: If it negates Phul with Invoked Mechaba you not only <strong>don't bring Bethor to the field as Phul goes banned</strong> which is horrible given the various ways to add this Phul from the GY to the hand or give Reborn <strong>and you didn't tribute to Benten who would add a Follow Up</strong> in the form of <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> making his <strong>turn less explosive</strong> and more susceptible to interactions. Not to mention that you <strong>can still Chain Block Megalith Bethor eff of destroying cards</strong> with <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> so <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> always solves, that is, you practically lose the game if you don't make the <strong>right decision when solving Megalith Phul</strong> on the opponent's turn.  Drawing Bricks from the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> allows you to <strong>make unorthodox plays that are really fun</strong> like being able to use <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> eff Add 1 Ritual on the GY on your 1st turn like Benten. With <strong>training you will realize that you will need to use the Impcantation engine differently depending on your cards in the starting hand</strong>, for example if you don't have any Ritual monsters like <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> in your hand but you have <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> to Ritual Summon you bring <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> with Penciplume <strong>instead of Candoll</strong> because adding a Ritual Monster is what you need to play and <strong>not adding Inception</strong> which would do no good to Ritual Summon. I've even found myself in the situation of having <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> in hand and Normal Summoning <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> to add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and being able to use <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> eff of bringing an Impcantation from the deck and playing. One thing I have to make clear about Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> is that before I said that you <strong>could Manju 1 Card Combo</strong> by Ritual Summoning with Inception <strong>using Manju as part of the tribute</strong> and this is <strong>wrong because Impcantation Inception must tribute only Impcantation monsters to Ritual Summon</strong> so you can never use <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or a <strong>Hand Trap</strong> or a <strong>Megalith Monster</strong> to Ritual Summon with <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> and therefore this combo is not possible. Using <strong>hand traps</strong> like <a data-name=""Psy-Framegerar Gamma"">Psy-Framegerar Gamma</a> in addition to working as a <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> in this deck as you activate <strong>many hand effects that require opponent's response</strong> while you don't control monsters like Impcantation and in this way Gamma can negate the Hand Trap of it, the <strong>Level 2 and Level 6</strong> of the <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a> are good to add with the <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> for example for you to activate <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and bring a Megalith from the deck because if the <strong>sum is 8</strong> you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> and if it's 4 you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>. Of course, it's <strong>not cool to use your Hand Traps to Ritual Summon</strong> but if you have to do that to play then you have no choice but to exchange Hand Traps for plays and I consider it <strong>very important to be able to get out of inertia as soon as possible</strong> rather than passing the turn with nothing on the field. Of course, if for example your hand opens from <a data-name=""Unformed"">Unformed</a> + <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> + <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> + <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> for example you have so much interaction to stop the opponent that you don't even have to worry about trying to play this turn, but if the <strong>hand comes very weak</strong> and your only move is to use <strong>Maxx ""C"" which is your only hand trap as a tribute you do this</strong>. Generally the <strong>top deck of Megalith is very good</strong> because the deck is very consistent so it is a balance where you have to predict what is best to do: <strong>use my hand traps as a tribute</strong> to <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> or be sure that these hand traps will stop the opponent's turn and on the return I have many chances to draw that helps me play.  <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> discards a card from your hand <strong>by effect and not by cost</strong>, so if your <strong>opponent negates it</strong>, you don't lose any cards from your hand. The <strong>same goes for the other Impcantation</strong> like <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> so if the opponent gives <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in the effect of Chalislime or Penciplume you will still have the same number of cards in hand and <strong>will be able to use its effect again next turn</strong>. This is one of the reasons the <strong>Impcantation engine is so good against interactions</strong> as the other reason is the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> <strong>eff on the GY</strong> which is a very good push against opponent interactions.  <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska"">Number 41: Bagooska</a> interacts very well with Spell/Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to buy time and get back into the game. One thing that happens a lot <strong>going second</strong> is you can do the Megalith combo and <strong>access Portal and Emergence</strong> but the opponent has a <strong>boss monster that you can't take out of the field</strong> on your 2nd turn and you <strong>need to somehow nullify that monster's threat</strong> on the turn of the opponent and on these occasions is that <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> shines because you do it and <strong>practically skip the opponent's turn</strong> at the same time that the opponent's annoying boss monster won't be able to use its effects that would hinder you too much. So what you do is with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> you are going to use this combination of effects to <strong>special a Megalith and add a Ritual Monster from GY to the hand twice</strong>, once on your opponent's turn and once on your Standby Phase and that way you will already have <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> and <strong>at least 2 Ritual Monsters on the field</strong> and in Main Phase 1 you can use these Ritual monsters to <strong>Link Summon</strong> monsters that will deal with the opponent's Boss Monster like <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>.  That's why I consider it an <strong>essential card in the Extra Deck</strong> because there were several times I needed to do it to <strong>avoid my opponent activating an effect of his Boss Monster</strong> and with the two Monster Reborn from <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> (1 on his turn and another on Standby Phase of my turn) I already had a way to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> for example and destroy his monster and win the game by taking his Boss Monster away. An example of this interaction I can give was against an ABC player who used the <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> effect of <strong>banishing a card I control</strong> but held back too much on the absurd effect of tribute himself and <strong>bringing 3 banished Light Machines</strong> back to the snedo field he still had <a data-name=""Union Hangar"">Union Hangar</a> to equip a piece on one of the monsters, so I made <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> which messes up his whole turn by making him just pass and I made <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> to destroy him and play good. He still used the <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> effect to try to bring the banished monsters but <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> <strong>negates the activated effect</strong> of any Defense Position monster so it doesn't do any good for you to <strong>tribute the monster as a cost</strong> like <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> that the effect will be denied in the same way.  A very simple way to play around <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> in <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is to <strong>activate Emergence but not use the effect</strong>, but in the <strong>resolution use the effect</strong> because if you take <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> at least Trap <strong>Emergence will remain on the field</strong> to be able to use effect again next turn, this is something every Shaddoll player should know because the same goes for <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>. Another tip when using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> on <strong>your turn is to use GY's Special Summon effect in the Standby Phase</strong> because this summon won't count for <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, which only counts the summons that happen <strong>during the Main Phase</strong> of the turn player.  Several times I took <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and managed to make a super simple play of <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> Add <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and pass turn with <strong>potential 2 Pops</strong> with Hagith as you <strong>use Unformed on the opponent's turn</strong> Tributing Hagith bringing <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> who makes <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a>.  XYZ <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vesperato"">Drill Driver Vesperato</a> is very useful in the deck mainly in conjunction with <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a> or <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> because you use their effects and in the end <strong>they run out of XYZ material</strong> and you do Drill Vesperato for up to end the game or have a monster with <strong>great Floating effect</strong>. Just remember that <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenate"">Drill Driver Vespenate</a> <strong>cannot be used as material for AA-ZEUS on the turn you Summon it above a RANK-4</strong> by the card's own restriction. And speaking of <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a> I consider it an excellent addition to the deck's <strong>RANK-4 Toolbox</strong> because in Modern Yugioh several decks have <strong>Follow Ups in GY</strong> such as Virtual World <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>, Sky Striker <a data-name=""Engage!"">Engage!</a>, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> among several other cards and Number 80 is a Double <a data-name=""D. D. Crow"">D. D. Crow</a> to deal with these problems. <a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a> is one of my favorite XYZ RANK-4 in the game, it is the best way for you to threaten <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> because it protects itself from <strong>destruction by battle or card effect</strong> and its interaction effect is very good in Yugioh Modern, even more than at the time it was used in everything that is the game's deck in 2015 if I'm not mistaken it <strong>forced everyone to put Extra Deck Monsters in Defense</strong> but <strong>LINK Monsters can never play around this card</strong> so you can deal with cards like <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> made with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or attach as material a LINK Monster from <strong>Sky Striker</strong> like <a data-name=""Shizuku"">Shizuku</a> and <a data-name=""Raye"">Raye</a> won't come back from GY because <strong>Xyz material is not considered as a card that left the field</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //  The XYZ RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> are cards that I recommend using if you have them in Master Duel and you can't craft some of the <strong>Xyz RANK-4 monsters I present in the Extra Deck</strong>. I don't even have all these Xyz in the Master Duel Extra Deck, but the ones I'm using in the Extra Deck are the <strong>ideal monsters to have in the Megalith deck</strong>. Of the Extra deck LINK monsters we have the ones that are mostly only <a data-name=""useful going first"">useful going first</a>: <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> is what you do practically whenever possible going first and if the hand is really good you do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> if you have <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> on hand. The <strong>Knightmare Link Monsters</strong> are cards to clear the opponent's field, especially <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> that surprised me in how efficient he was in several games where he dealt with problems before he even needed to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>. <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a> I saw that he was very redundant in games and I <strong>practically didn't use him</strong> because every match I could do I chose Knightmare Link to deal with problems in the opponent's field. But it's still a <strong>great win condition against Control decks</strong>.  <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Aratron"">Megalith Aratron</a>: I consider <a data-name=""Aratron"">Aratron</a> an unnecessary card in the deck <strong>unless you are using Block Dragon</strong> in the deck that adds the monsters needed for you to Ritual Summon on the opponent's turn with Aratron eff. One thing about <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> in Megalith deck is the synergy between <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> with <strong>Level 8 Monsters</strong> be it <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a> for example. This allows you to make excellent plays and even <strong>loop Black Chaos MAX with Megalith Phul and Megalith Portal</strong>. No wonder Block Dragon was excellent in the deck but I consider that the way the deck plays today is much <strong>more resilient to interactions and you use your resources much more efficiently</strong>.  <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> is a card that would be used in the Extra Deck to be sent to the GY by <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> but as I already explained <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is better in the Megalith deck. <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> is a good Tech Card to use in your deck and can help you play around <a data-name=""Nibiru,"">Nibiru,</a> but I realized that it was <strong>Win More</strong> because if you got to the point of adding it to your hand it's because you're <strong>already winning the game </strong>and he was taking up a <strong>Hand Trap space</strong>. I thought he was good for being able to deny Nibiru but most of the times I took Nibiru playing with this deck I <strong>managed to extend plays and pass with the deck's standard field</strong> and there are times when you open with a weak combo and there's no way to play around Nibiru from no way so it makes no difference having the Herald of Orange Light on the decklist. <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> is a card that I recommend at least in <strong>Megalith side decks</strong> if they exist in Master Duel someday because it is searchable by <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> and is good against many decks that ban cards to play.  <a data-name=""Extra-Foolish Burial"">Extra-Foolish Burial</a> is an interesting card if you use <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> in Extra Deck because it does the <strong>same thing as Diviner of the Herald</strong> of sending those cards to the GY and becoming a Search of Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell or a pop of an opponent's card going second. But the <strong>main conflict of this card in the deck is</strong> the restriction of ""<strong>you can't set Spells/Traps during the turn that activates this card</strong>"" which means you can't set <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> which is one of the main spells/traps that the deck uses.  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, it's just here for me to comment on some specific cards I'm not using in the decklist but they are common to see used in Megalith deck.  &nbsp;"

Try to set Marshmallon to the field facedown ASAP since it can not be destroyed by battle, also when flipped face up it inflicts 1000 damage to your enemy. Activate Marshmallon Glasses as soon as Marshmallon is flipped face up, thus making your opponent only able to attack Marshmallon while you have other monsters on the field, thus stalling your opponent. <strong>ALSO</strong> , try to activate Dark Snake Syndrome(DSS) ASAP to drain both each others life points to end the game quicker. While DSS is activated, try to summon Des Wombat, making your opponent the only person to take damage from DSS. Also, Marshmallon Glasses prevents your enemy from destroying Des Wombat. Your <strong>main</strong> 4 spell cards you need to play as soon as you draw them are Dark Snake Syndrome, Level Limit Area B, Wave Motion Cannon and Scapegoat. You are mostly going to be using your trap cards to inflict damage to your opponent and negate attacks if they destroy your spell cards. If you are going first on TURN 1 and drew ''Secret Barrel'' from your 5 cards, set it , and activate it (Secret Barrel) at the beginning of your opponents <strong>TURN 1-MAIN PHASE 1</strong> to instantly inflict 1200 damage to your opponent.  Be sure to use ''Poison of the Old Man'' to either instantly inflict 800 damage to your opponent or gain 1200 LP to your own LP. Great card to use since your are both losing LP every one of your stand-by phases  from DSS. <strong>Stall and burn, Stall and burn, STALL AND BURN!</strong>"

Treasure Panda here we go","EDIT: YGOProDeck claims Tune Warrior is a UR, but I guarantee you it's an N card on MD. Please also be aware this is exclusively for the N/R Festival and there's no point to playing this outside of it. Thanks!  I'm a jank deck player by heart, and while examining the N/R Master Duel event I noticed that it has a lot of the Exodia support cards and even every Forbidden One piece... except Exodia's head, which is SR. So there goes the whole strategy, right? ...Right?  This deck aims to take advantage of 3 cards, Treasure Panda, The Legendary Exodia Incarnate, and amusingly enough, ""Obliterate!"". Your main goal is to get Treasure Panda on the field through either summoning it or Giant Rat activation after you've put a few spell/traps in the GY, so you can then spam out either Exodia pieces or other Normal Monsters as tuners and whatnot to summon a variety of Extra Deck monsters. Treasure Panda also unlocks L.Ex.Inc.s in hand, who can otherwise be pretty nasty bricks, and lets you get a weird unaffected monster that can get reasonably large with support OR just loop Forbidden One cards back to hand every turn.  So why do you want to loop Forbidden One cards anyway? The answer is Obliterate!, which is actually really crazy in this format. See, people play Compulse in N/R format because it can end someone's turn in a flash and trades 1 for 1 with really big monsters your opponent minused to go into, or otherwise just disrupts people's turns at Quick-Play speed. So what if I told you that Exodia decks get to just play a card which Compulses the opponent EVERY TURN while Foolish Burialing at the same time? Obliterate! is the main way you can survive more proactive opponents' aggression, bouncing key cards like Heart-Earth Dragon or Megaliths halfway through their summon chains, and it doesn't set off destruction protections like a lot of other removal has to in this format. Even if your opponent blows it up, you can use the second effect to get back a Legendary Exodia Incarnate or something and then start going ham.  The rest of the deck is more or less designed to assist this plan. Exodius is a weird card that normally won't be doing a lot, but its biggest advantage is recycling your graveyard - he's a free special summon for Link Plays (or even Xyz summoning Ravenous Tarantula -&gt; The Seven Sins), and he gives you a full reload of Obliterate!, increases the length of your Giant Rat chains, turns Treasure Panda back on, and so forth. Hand Destruction is just one of the few ways to bin a lot of stuff so you have cards to banish to Panda, White Elephant's Gift combos nicely with Panda or Normal Monster decks in general, Tri-Wight gives you extension in the late game for last minute Extra Deck plays, and Gizmek Makami gives you a very late game option if you want to try to shuffle your banished Exodiuses back to start all over again.  The Normal Monster lineup looks a bit weird, but serves specific purposes. Flamvell Guardian is a level 1 tuner, so you can make a level 5 or 2 synchro with it fairly easily. Tune Warrior is one of the biggest options available to you and also a Tuner for going into PSY-Framelord Zeta, a very powerful piece of interaction. It also gives you an option for if you want to get 3 cards out of the GY to summon the Gizmek later. I've experimented with other stuff like Galaxy Serpent, but I think the nature of the available cards in the format makes this a reliable engine. Bunilla probably looks pretty strange, but it's an Earth you can summon off of Giant Rat in an emergency.  The trap lineup is a bit standard, although I think it could be better. Paleozoic Dinomischus is a mandatory staple for many decks in the format and given our lack of Spell/Trap removal it's even more important here as a multifaceted card that can make use of useless LEIs in the hand. Jelly Cannon was added as a means to get 1 for 1 trades that beat common protection in a deck that needs stuff to do its job and then be banishable by Panda. Torrential Tribute can win a game on its own and is particularly notable for not killing LEI due to its card effect protection, it also has interesting potential with a card in the Extra Deck. Compulsory is just another card that both acts as a Jelly Cannon effect and can reuse a Treasure Panda target that you have sitting around uselessly on the field.  The Extra Deck is by no means perfect and probably shouldn't be so varied, but it features a variety of options I enjoy. Let's start with the smallest set, the Xyzes. These are fairly self explanatory - Slacker Magician is a tolerable stall play, Lion Heart occasionally wins games through ""Burn BS"" and is not too hard to make with Treasure Panda, and Ravenous Tarantula + Seven Sins is a decent enough combo in a deck that occasionally gets both Exodius and LEI on the board with low attack stats or ends up with much lower LP than the opponent.  The Link Monsters are also fairly basic - Cross-Sheep, Geonator Transverser, and Berserker of the Tenyi are respectable format staples for just getting big man on the board or removing problem cards. You have 2 other types of monster in your deck so you can take advantage of Cross-Sheep's ATK modifying abilities. Powercode Talker is basically just a negate you can make in an emergency, but also is a good card if you can spam out enough Monsters because it can win combat by having something to tribute for once. Doublebyte Dragon I have never summoned but can think of scenarios where you'd really want it, so it's here just in case we need to beat over an annoying Xyz monster or something. Defender of the Labyrinth, finally, is pretty mediocre and probably shouldn't be here - but I love having an excuse to play it in a deck that might actually take advantage of it. You can summon Berserker of the Tenyi with this, you know!  The Synchros are where the most room for examination lies. Honestly, you could probably dump this part of the deck entirely if you wanted and just go for Link + Xyz spam, but I like several of these cards enough to keep them around. Puralis is simply a way to convert 2 Treasure Panda summons into a larger Tuner with a small effect, although we don't have a 6 to complete the combo with Panda itself, you can still Link it off or something for a coup de grace. Framelord Zeta is one of the most powerful cards in the deck and you could honestly try to make the list into Zeta turbo if you wanted by playing more copies + more Tune Warriors, I've gone ahead and stuck with one for now because I haven't made more. Crystron Anetrix is a weird option but as a generic 5 you can do much worse, it punishes opponents that play monsters with low defense and can even swing a game in certain contexts, having Summoned Skull ATK is quite appealing as well. The oddest choice in this deck is probably the twin Balmungs - many would rather run the Entity card that occasionally steals opponent's monsters. My reason for avoiding that is that I don't have any actual Spell/Trap destruction, so I don't have a good way to get rid of it and trigger its more impressive effect.  The real thing I like about Balmung, though, is that it's a non-once per turn card that doesn't rule out itself. In other words, if your opponent has some sort of aggressive destruction effect that repeats over and over, you can actually cycle through two Balmungs indefinitely so long as none of them are destroyed by Battle. Even better, Balmung on its own reborns all sorts of cards you particularly care about like Treasure Panda and Giant Rat, as well as your defensive normal monsters and tuners. Balmung doesn't even care who blew it up, so you can activate Torrential Tribute in response to your own summon to wipe the board and get a card back. Isn't that cool? I think a truly better version of the deck would probably replace Balmung with the Entity and then a summonable 6 for Puralis lines, but I don't think this version is too troublesome.  I would say that the main things this deck is looking for if you want to try to improve it are ways to get cards into the graveyard faster and ways to protect Treasure Panda. Unfortunately, there are no generic level 11 or 12 Synchros in N/R format, so it's impossible to use the Exodias and our Tuners to make Star Eaters or something. A version of this deck focused exclusively on Link spamming with a small Rank 10 package could work, but I like some of the options Synchros offer in a deck that makes Cross-Sheep regularly, so it's really up to personal taste.  The most cuttable parts of the deck right now are probably Exodius, the Gizmek, and some of the traps. Gizmek doesn't work very well because the big Exodias don't have the same ATK as DEF, so it's exclusively a way to give an already slow deck a longer grind game. Exodius is tolerable and serves an important niche but is also usually relatively useless - perhaps if there were more monsters with GY effects in the deck he'd be a better roleplayer (did you know he bins effect monsters and not just the Normals he counts? I forget lol but I guess it makes sense if he needs to send the head). Hand Destruction is ok but I can't help but feel like there's more spell/traps that cycle through the deck I'm not finding. Nevertheless, I've had a reasonably enjoyable time seeing this deck actually do something, even if it's occasionally an agonizing stallfest of sitting under Obliterate as you bounce a card every turn until you draw something relevant. Overall, I'd say play this if you think Exodialess Exodia is funny, and to make people misplay trying to stop you from assembling all 5 in hand because they don't know the head is banned!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Especially considering it was made at a whim off of a random combo line idea lol. Starting off, I do not think this is a ""rogue"" strategy at all, this deck is only amazing in BO1 going first, otherwise known as MD format, for this to be a rogue deck it would actually need to be able to survive a single Ash Blossom. The deck falls off in a BO3 with no real good board breakers or combos going second that can survive any somewhat competent board. You could probably win a small event with less people who only play meta decks, I suppose. Unfortunately this deck has no real 1-2 card combo's that don't lead to ending your turn if you get interrupted by a hand-trap. I would love to play Utopia at a meta level, but Konami typically prefers to keep casual and meta archetypes separate. Not gonna call it a Fun/Casual deck either, not much ""fun"" when you get Kali Yuga'd turn 1. This deck is more of an experiment with Utopia, to see what could it do at peak performance and no interruptions. The deck is built for more of an environment where you might run into some meta decks that play a more consistent number of handtraps, but you can remove them to make room for more consistency boosters like <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin, or more copies of </a><a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>, <a data-name=""Zexal Field"">Zexal Field</a> and potentially a <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> if you want to. For the most part the only non-typical Utopia deck card in the Main Deck is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch. The extra deck has been of altered from a typical Utopia deck of course, to fit the Kali Yuga package of </a><a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, </a><a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch""> (or </a><a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, just needs to be a Rank 7 Dark Number XYZ), </a><a data-name=""Number 71: Rebarian Shark"">Number 71: Rebarian Shark</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, and </a><a data-name=""Number 56: Gold Rat"">Number 56: Gold Rat</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">.</a>  This deck uses the Onomat engine to get to the three main Onomat cards used in a normal utopia full combo, as well as using <a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a> + Astraltopia to get to the same combo.  The first few ""pre-combos"" funnel you into the main combo.  Bricks/Garnets are Double or Nothing, and either of the 2 ZW's. Drawing any of the combo pieces you intend to search, like Zexal Field or any of the Rank-Up-Magic cards can be bad in some situations but the combos are simple enough to adapt based on what you drew in your starting hand.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  PRE-COMBO 1:  Onomatopaira + Any 1 Onomat monster + Any 1 Random Card  Onomatopaira searching the 2 Onomats you don't have in hand discarding 1 random card.  PRE-COMBO 2:  Onomatopickup + Onomatopaira + Any 1 Random Cards  Onomatopickup to search Utopic Onomatopeia, Paira to search the remaining 2 discarding the random card  MAIN COMBO 1:  Summon Utopic Onomatopeia  Use Utopic Eff to summon the other two Onomats  Using Utopic and Bancho summon Utopic Sage  Utopic Sage eff summon Ascended Sage  Use Bancho to summon back Utopic Ono  Use Glove effect in GY to SS back on field  Use the three Onomats to summon Primathmech, activating its optional effect on summon to search for Astraltopia  Summon Astraltopia using it's effect  Use Sage and Primathmech to make Utopic Future and then Utopic Draco Future  Use Astraltopia effect either sending Onomatopickup if you went that precombo route, or a random card in hand to GY, searching Zexal Field. If you have Zexal Field, search out Numbers Protection for an additional omni-negate if you for some reason need it on your next turn after you Kali Yuga them.  Activate Zexal Field  Use Astraltopia and Ascended Sage to make Utopia Double.  Activate Utopia Double's optional effect, and Zexal Field's effect in that order. There's no particular reason to order it in way to chain block since at this point you would have been interrupted at this point if they had anything. DO NOT CHAIN UTOPIA DOUBLE's EFFECT YET. Attach Rebarian Shark and search Hyper Rank Up Magic.  Use Utopia Double's effect to summon Utopia.  Use Utopia to summon Utopia Prime.  Use Hyper Rank Up Magic to summon Dragonar, I recommend summoning in defense to avoid lightning storm.  Activate Dragonar's effect, make sure to detach Rebarian Shark, to summon Gold Rat.  Activate Hyper Rank Up Magic's optional GY effect  Activate Rebraian Shark's GY effect to put Phantom Knights' Rank up on the top of the deck  Use Gold Rat's effect to draw one, and return any other card in hand.  Set Phantom Knights' Rank Up (and Numbers Protection if you have it)  In the draw phase, use Dragonar to summon your choice of Rank 7 Dark Attribute Number (Big Eye or Mind Hacker, I went with Mind Hacker for aesthetic).  I recommend summoning it in defense to avoid lightning storm.  DO NOT ACTIVATE HYPER RANK UP MAGIC's OPTIONAL EFFECT.  The first moment you can chain Phantom Knights' Rank Up, Zexal Field will make it in-respondable, ensuring Kali Yuga will hit the board.  I recommend waiting until they either attempt to activate Droplet, Imperm or any form of a negate/board breaker, to circumvent them attempting to chain to Kali Yuga's on summon effect.  During the end phase I would recommend activating Kali Yuga's effect to clear the board of any spell and trap cards on the field, this will include your set numbers protect, so if you wish save numbers protect until your turn and then Kali Yuga after you've used it.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  COMBO 2:  ZS - Ascended Sage + Astraltopia + Any 1 Random Card  Special Summon Ascended Sage  Normal Summon Astraltopia  Use Astraltopia, discarding 1 random card to search Zexal Field  Activate Zexal Field  Use Astraltopia and Ascended Sage to make Utopia Double.  Activate Utopia Double's optional effect, and Zexal Field's effect in that order. There's no particular reason to order it in way to chain block since at this point you would have been interrupted at this point if they had anything. DO NOT CHAIN UTOPIA DOUBLE's EFFECT YET. Attach Rebarian Shark and search Hyper Rank Up Magic.  Use Utopia Double's effect to summon Utopia.  Use Utopia to summon Utopia Prime.  Use Hyper Rank Up Magic to summon Dragonar, I recommend summoning in defense to avoid lightning storm.  Activate Dragonar's effect, make sure to detach Rebarian Shark, to summon Gold Rat.  Activate Hyper Rank Up Magic's optional GY effect  Activate Rebraian Shark's GY effect to put Phantom Knights' Rank up on the top of the deck  Use Gold Rat's effect to draw one, and return any other card in hand.  Set Phantom Knights' Rank Up (and Numbers Protection if you have it)  In the draw phase, use Dragonar to summon your choice of Rank 7 Dark Attribute Number (Big Eye or Mind Hacker, I went with Mind Hacker for aesthetic).  I recommend summoning it in defense to avoid lightning storm.  DO NOT ACTIVATE HYPER RANK UP MAGIC's OPTIONAL EFFECT.  The first moment you can chain Phantom Knights' Rank Up, Zexal Field will make it in-respondable, ensuring Kali Yuga will hit the board.  I recommend waiting until they either attempt to activate Droplet, Imperm or any form of a negate/board breaker, to circumvent them attempting to chain to Kali Yuga's on summon effect.  During the end phase I would recommend activating Kali Yuga's effect to clear the board of any spell and trap cards on the field, this will include your set numbers protect, so if you wish save numbers protect until your turn and then Kali Yuga after you've used it.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Additional Info:  So you may notice that the side deck is literally the entire Numeron Package. Utopia is unfortunately kind of... bad going second for the most part. Paira will most likely be negated if they have a spell negate set up, Ascended search will be negated most likely and odds are you don't have lethal if you some how make it through all the negates and make something like Utopia Double OTK combo, which is a 10k beat stick basically will almost certainly not kill them if they do not have any monster out with 2k atk. Numeron Package is basically just... dome them in the most cheap way possible through what they have setup, they most likely will not be prepared for it depending on how many negates they have. While not listed you can theoretically include the Scythe Package of 2 Artifact Sanctum and 1 Artifact Scythe in there as well if you really want to be """"""meta"""""".  There is not any particularly any other amazing targets to go into, though there is one target if you're playing MD, which is er uh, VFD using Number 23 as base material. Number 23 allows you to activate Hyper Rank Up's GY effect giving you one omni negate before going into VFD if ya nasty like that.  I highly recommend reading this deck list:  https://ygoprodeck.com/utopia-master-duel-feb22/  This decklist goes through all the real combos this deck can do that aren't a little bit toxic, and is overall an amazing decklist, I think it's one of, if not the best Utopia decklists available online, though don't just copy and paste and call it a day, experiment to your liking.  The deck is currently made to allow for alternate combo's in case of brick, though you could most certainly edit it to be more consistent with the kali yuga combo, Utopia is not brick proof due to the high investment combos, so I do not recommend trying to replace all the side combo lines just to Kali Yuga turbo slightly more consistently, but potentially brick more.  This is not the only Utopia deck of this caliber that I have but it is the one that is most refined, and most consistent of the bunch due to the 6 searchers and 9 Onomat count in main deck. The other combo is Scythe Control Utopia, which I'm not particularly proud of, very reliant on drawing Sky Striker Engage (yes its a utopia deck with link monsters) or just hard drawing scythe or the artifact trap card. Extremely hard to optimize since it goes out of its way off the main combo route to do that.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Cut-able/Swap-able Cards:  Zexal Construction:  VERY easy to cut out of the deck and replace with any other card you feel you need more of. An inherent minus one, but can unbrick your hand as a result of it.  ZW cards:  In the main kali yuga combo drawing the ZW's can be bricky, if you want to still keep one in case you need to go into leo ray, keep Pegasus Twin Saber.  Double or Nothing:  So this one is much more tricky, you don't need double or nothing to do the main combo, since you detach rebarian shark with dragonar, but this is also for the less optimal hands where you can only go into leo ray potentially. This is the second most cut-able card if you feel like the deck is consistent enough for you to not need the double lines. Combo would basically be the same but you hard summon Utopia instead of summoning it with Utopia Double.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Final thoughts:  I've loved Utopia since I was a kid, was my first structure deck and everything so I keep trying to keep this deck even vaguely relevant in this day and age, especially since Lyril Tri doesn't summon UDF anymore so I don't really get to use any utopia cards if I play a meta deck. Overall this deck can let you compete against some meta decks if they don't have any meaningful interaction, or if you somehow have enough to push through them and win still. I don't expect to see Utopia ever top a real tournament despite some lists on this site calling this deck ""rogue"" or ""meta"" because they beat the people at their locals who don't have meta decks at the top level. Have fun with this deck and let me know if you think there's any potential cards to add or change to boost its consistency that bit more without just ruining the core identity of the deck. If you want to do this consistently, I think Phantom Knights can still do this but I honestly have no idea to be honest."

Its effect is the best among the three mini bears since it allows you to add more options to your existing hands.</li>  	<li><strong>Miktanus</strong> will be the one to recycle the Ursarctic bears you need once you've filled up GY with bears used as tributes/materials for Polari summoning process. Primary target of Polari revival effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Mikbilis</strong> will be the least desired mini bear to be used, but is a good summon/revival target for swarming or triggering Radiation's effect.</li>  	<li>The level 8 mega bears are the Tuner and work as main handtrap of the deck, which <em>enable you to disrupt your opponent with their effects during their main phase.</em></li>  	<li><strong>Megatanus'</strong> pseudo Book of Moon effect is the one that you'll frequently use, as flipping face-down opponent's starter monster is often an effective way to halt their combo.</li>  	<li>The effectiveness of <strong>Megabilis</strong> D.D. Crow-like banish effect varies depending on your opponent's deck, as banishing opponent's key combo piece could be a great loss for them. Also works as huge beatstick with its highest ATK among the mega bears.</li>  	<li><strong>Megapolar's</strong> MST-like single backrow destruction is a nice utility. But considering the capability of other package/monsters in the deck, this mega bear's effect will be less likely used.</li>  	<li>It is optimal to have 1-2 mega bears in your hand ready at the end of the turn so that you can play them during opponent's turn as needed.</li>  	<li>I keep <strong>Big Dipper</strong> at 1 copy for reasons: 1) It is a potential brick, since you'll prefer to have it searched by Polari's effect, 2) It is recycle-able by Radiation, unless it's banished.</li>  	<li><strong>Departure</strong> is a decent searcher card that keeps your hand stocked with the bears. To avoid potential loss, it is advised to only use it after baiting opponent's ash/negates by starting out using other search effect first, such as Mikpolar or Crystal Girl.</li>  	<li><strong>Radiation</strong> allows you to offset the tribute costs that the bears used by its (potential) 7 draws. It will also allows you to: 1) Dig further into the deck as you summon the bears, gaining either more tribute fodders or other combo lines' pieces 2) Chain-blocking Ursarctic monster search effects by its triggered effect as Chain-2, thus protecting Mikpolar/Polari's effect (that's activated as Chain-1) from Ash Blossom interference.</li>  	<li><em><strong>D</strong><strong>o not be tempted and extend your play too much that you're using up Radiation's 7 draws just in one turn</strong></em>; having to draw 2-3 times per turn from its effect is usually enough to replenish your hand resources for the turn.</li>  	<li>Radiation's GY recycling effect can be used to remove and recycle duplicate bears from the GY, thus avoiding interference from Called by the Grave's effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Slider</strong> works either as: 1) Nice extender if you're lacking of playable bears and tributes, 2) As additional disruption once you've piled up GY or banished cards. Its main selling point is the ability to revive banished face-up bears, thus allowing you to banish the bears in GY (from Big Dipper effect) without worry and access them later on.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Instead of rushing to climb into the level 7 synchro bears on the starting turn, I think it may be better to keep Polari on field to start off.</strong></em> Its recycling/revival effect can be used on later turns if it survived next opponent's turn, and it alone satisfies the requirement to activate Big Dipper's monster-stealing effect. Having it destroyed also won't be large loss unlike getting level 7 synchro bears that you rushed to summon being destroyed instead.</li>  	<li>With <strong>Quint Charge,</strong> you can take opponent by surprise during their turn by summoning appropriate level 7 synchro bears using the available Polari and mega bears. It also serves as backup option to recover some bears in GY, thus preserving the deck's resources especially in late-game. You'll prefer to get this trap later on and not in the starting hand, thus its status as the package's garnet.</li>  	<li><strong>Grand Chariot</strong> is a good candidate for this Quint Charge summon effect since destroy 2 effect during opponent's turn is quite beneficial/fatal. Else, you can prioritize summoning it if you'd like to protect Big Dipper from any targeting removal.</li>  	<li><strong>Septentrion</strong> is the main selling of the archetype (for most people) since it's able to lock out Xyz or Link-based decks. It is better summoned once you've recognized what deck opponent is playing. The search effect is a good additional effect that lets you adapt to opponent's move in their turn, either by: 1) Getting a mega bear for disruption, 2) Preparing a recovery option through Departure.</li> </ul> <span>-- Melffy/Beasts package --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Catty</strong> will be the main part of the package, since it's able to fetch various cards from your deck, mainly: level 7 mini bears, <strong>Bigfoot, Alpha, Kerass,</strong> and <strong>Hop Ear.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong> is the key that gives level 7 mini bears another utility as Synchro material. It enables you to gain access to level 9 Synchro monsters during opponent's turn, which are able to create powerful disruption (see more in Level 9 Synchro monsters section). Getting level 10 Synchro monsters using Hop Ear is also possible, but it's very less likely to happen compared to summoning level 9 Synchro monsters.</li> </ul> <span>-- Danger! package --</span> <ul>  	<li>Even though their effect won't activate from being tributed for the bears' summoning cost, the deck has enough discard effects that can make use of the package's potential: Departure and Ravenous Crocodragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Nessie's</strong> useful mostly for preserving hand advantage by getting Bigfoot on your hand. If Nessie is summoned to the field, it can be used alongside level 8 mega bears to call Polari as the level 7 material.</li>  	<li><strong>Bigfoot's</strong> destruction effect is pretty much self-explanatory.</li>  	<li>The package's ""random self discard, then draw 1 if it isn't discarded"" effect may prove useful to unbrick unplayable hand. However, since it depends mostly on luck for both random discard and one draw, you're not guaranteed to get a good result from it.</li> </ul> <span>-- Swordsoul/Wyrm package --</span> <ul>  	<li>The main reason it is included in the deck to get easier access to level 10 Synchro monster, especially <strong>Qixing Longyuan </strong>as going first play. Without the package, the deck can reliable enough to get into level 10 Synchro by using level 8 mega bears with increased amount of level 2 monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Bixi</strong> enables you to access Qixing Longyuan by using up your normal summon and one level 8 mega bear on field.</li>  	<li><strong>Longyuan</strong> can turn another copy of itself or other Wyrm monster as an easy access to level 10 Synchro monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Chengying</strong> is pretty much the most powerful and reliable boss monster available for the deck. Combined with Big Dipper/Departure GY banish effect (for substituting bears' tribute cost) or Megabilis' GY banish, you can trigger Chengying's removal effect easily.</li>  	<li><strong>Qixing Longyuan</strong> is a good boss monster to have in turn 1. Its immediate banish effect may prove useful to disrupt opponent's starting play if they're going second.</li>  	<li><strong>Vishuda</strong> fits really well with this package while serving as eligible Ursarctic tribute cost. With the presence of normal monster (Swordsoul token or Monk of the Tenyi), its bounce effect adds more option to chip away opponent's board. Being able to be summoned instantly from hand if there's no effect monsters on field, Vishuda can be a good optional starting point to get into Polari thus making it less of a brick.</li>  	<li><strong>Monk of the Tenyi</strong> enables you to use Vishuda's effect without needing to wait for Longyuan's Swordsoul token, thus making the three copies of Vishuda as a consistent going second card option.</li>  	<li><strong>Longyuan</strong> in the hand can possibly become quite a brick, sadly. It really needs another Wyrm in hands to activate, and being level 6 makes it not legible as Ursarctic tribute cost. If there's no way that you'll draw another Wyrm monster soon enough (such as by betting on Radiation's draw effect), you can use it for discard fodder whenever possible, instead.</li>  	<li>If you don't feel like playing this package, you can take it out from the deck and replace it with alternatives (refer to alternatives section below).</li> </ul> <span>-- Going 2nd cards --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Gameciel</strong> pretty much does what people expect from Kaijus: removal by tribute. Being a water attribute monster enables it to be searched by Crystal Girl. Else, a tribute fodder for the bears.</li>  	<li>With its quick effect, <strong>Pankratops</strong> enables the deck to: 1) Have better way to break a bit of opponent's complete turn 1 board, 2) Protecting your combo play by pressuring your opponent by its chainable effect. Same as Nessie, being a level 7 makes it a good material to summon Polari (although you'll prefer to use it more for its removal effect). If you're going first, it can serves as tribute fodder for the bears, instead.</li>  	<li><strong>Alpha</strong> fits well with the deck mostly because of Melffy package; It is searchable by Catty as I've mentioned before. Once it is used for its bouncing effect, you can tribute it to proceed on Ursarctic line of combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Eldlich</strong> has unique roles in this deck: 1) Even though the chance of happening is low, Eldlich enables you to make use of other copies of Departure or Radiation that is bricking your hand, 2) Non-ED easy access to high ATK monster, as long as you can sacrifice one of your available spell/trap cards. Keep in note that its high level count isn't compatible to be used as Synchro material.</li> </ul> <span>-- Tri-Brigade package --</span> <ul>  	<li>Tri-Brigade package will be mostly used as late-game strategy, considering the GY is likely to be filled up with enough materials at that time (Ursarctic, Melffy, Hop Ear, Bigfoot).</li>  	<li>Considering<strong><em> Ursarctic monsters lock out monsters without levels because of their summoning condition</em></strong> and the package doesn't include other Tri-Brigade main deck monsters to fuel the GY early on (since they'll most likely to be brick), <em>the package is unable to function in turn 1.</em></li>  	<li>Since <strong>Kerass</strong> fits the requirement to be searched by Catty and can easily special summon itself, it is more preferred compared to his fellow Nervall and Kitt. Other than being used for its Link summoning capability, being a level 2 makes it compatible with level 8 mega bears as Synchro material. Considered to be a garnet you don't want to see in your opening hand.</li>  	<li><strong>Shuraig's</strong> banish effect can be triggered by any Ursarctic or Hop Ear's quick summoning effect, so you can take advantage of it during opponent's turn as long as you have enough resource to do so.</li> </ul> <span>-- Level 9 Synchro monsters --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Shenshen</strong> that's summoned during opponent's turn is pretty much a powerful GY lock move, effective especially against GY-reliant strategy/decks. Since the deck contains enough diversity of types and attributes, you can easily revive Shenshen on later turns (such as banishing Hop Ear or Bigfoot with any mega bears). The primary target for its recycle effect is <strong>Crystal Girl,</strong> which enables you to revive it again and triggers its search effect after special summoned.</li>  	<li><strong>Ravenous Crocodragon</strong> fits well with the deck. Its draw effect on summon at least relieves our hand resource a bit, while the discard -&gt; destroy effect is able to make use the Danger! package and any bricks that are clogging the hands. Once it lived out its usefulness, you can use it alongside level 8 mega bears to bring out Polari.</li>  	<li><strong>Stellar Wind Wolfrayet</strong> is another decent pick for level 9 Synchro monsters roster. Its field-wide, non-destruction monster removal effect is sure powerful and gives similar pressure as Big Dipper, but easy for the opponent to play around. It is also noticeably lack of removal protection, thus having Almiraj is recommended if you're planning to get it on the field.</li> </ul> <span>-- Other cards --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Crystal Girl</strong> is one of the most desired starters beside Mikpolar. Use its on-summon search effect to: 1) Getting level 8 mega bears ready for next turn, 2) Add Gameciel for later turns usage, 3) Bait out Ash Blossom from confused/inexperienced first-time opponents. It also enables you to access level 9 Synchro monsters by using it as materials alongside level 8 mega bears. Since it has revival effect (which requirement is pretty easy as long as you have any bears or Ravenous Crocodragon on field), you can send it to GY by using it as discard fodder (especially for Departure). In doing so, you can use normal summon of that turn for something else.</li>  	<li><strong>Pot of Desires</strong> should've not be limited due to its usefulness for the deck. It pretty much gives the deck lots of advantage: 1) +2 new cards in hands for further play, 2) Thinning out the deck once you've got all important pieces like Big Dipper on field/hand/GY, 3) Powering up Chengying by a mile. It is advisable to use it after you've activated Big Dipper on the field, as it'll be detrimental having the only one important field spell banished accidentally, unable to be salvaged.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn</strong> works well as extender and recovery option. Keep in mind that Ursarctic ED monsters can't be special summoned using this, thus making the other ED monsters as more suitable revival target.</li>  	<li><strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> pretty much has similar pressuring GY lockout role like Shenshen, while also offering one-time omni negate. <em>(Considering recent changes of the deck recipe where Melffy Puppy and Kalantosa are removed, it'll be quite hard and less consistent to summon this monster.</em> <em>It is recommended to add those monsters if you'd like to add more consistency on summoning this monster.)</em></li>  	<li><strong>Almiraj</strong> pretty much slightly covers the deck's lack of protection from destroy effect. Be aware that you can't summon it after Ursarctic monsters have summoned themselves and locked out the ED. Thus, the best time to summon Almiraj is after normal summoning Crystal Girl from your starting play.</li>  	<li><strong>Trishula Zero</strong> is a pretty nice accessible surprise that can be made by the deck, although it won't appear very often. It is usually summoned by using level 8 mega bears, any level 2 monster, and Crystal Girl (which usually just revived itself). Since it'll be a waste to not make use of its last effect, I decided to include normal <strong>Trishula</strong> to take advantage of it. Normal Trishula is nigh impossible to summon beside using Trishula Zero effect, thus eating up one of important ED slots.</li> </ul> <span>-- Alternatives --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> can be used as the another copy of <strong>Catty.</strong> Having it alongside Catty on the field is also useful to ensure Catty search effect not being negated by Ash Blossom, since you can make a chain block of Catty &gt; Puppy. Add <strong>Kalantosa</strong> alongside Puppy if you'd like another form of sudden disruption, but keep in mind of their status as potential brick.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> is a niche one; it enables you to summon level 7 mini bears during opponent's turn even though you're not having level 7+ monsters as eligible tribute.</li>  	<li><strong>Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun</strong> is a good budget pick for going 2nd card, which covers up similar role as Pankratops (but worse). Being a Beast-Warrior type also synergetic as Tri-Brigade GY link fodder. 2 copies at most.</li>  	<li><strong>Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</strong> can be an alternative to replace Gameciel if you'd like to anticipate facing wind barrier statue lock.</li>  	<li><strong>Tri-Brigade Nervall</strong> is a good normal summon candidate, which can also be used for Synchro materials/discard fodder while it triggers the search effect to fetch Kerass to your hand. 1-2 may be quite enough.</li>  	<li><strong>Ultimate Flagship Ursatron </strong>may give you more option on handling Ursarctic-based resources. However, its lack of protection and the complications you'll need to get through to summon it don't justify its usage. The best way to summon Ursatron is probably by using Quint Charge, but you'll need to give up one Polari on the field as a cost and the summoning method is considerably slow due to Quint Charge status as a trap card. Using <strong>Drytron Fafnir</strong> + <strong>Ursarctic Drytron</strong> sounds nice, but having to run additional bricks/garnets while also using Big Dipper on field as material (which have more impactful effects) are quite risky choice.</li>  	<li><strong>Linkuriboh</strong> for people who prefers battle protection instead of Almiraj's.</li>  	<li><b>Hraesvelgr </b>is a good summon target for Tri-Brigade package if you don't have enough materials in GY, or if you'd like to use its effect before climbing with Kerass into Link-4.</li>  	<li><strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> is an alternative Link-4 to climb after summoning Hraesvelgr by using Kerass. Potentially a better finisher compared to Shuraig. For ones with enough money or Master Duel players.</li>  	<li><strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong> is self-explanatory. Again, for ones with enough money or Master Duel players.</li>  	<li><strong>Vermillion Dragon Mech</strong> is a nice alternative if you don't like Ravenous Crocodragon's steep discard cost. The easily paid cheap cost for the destruction effect is nice, but since it's not a quick effect and the recycle effect can only trigger if this card is destroyed by card effect... I feel that Ravenous Crocodragon is a more flexible and rewarding option.</li>  	<li><strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> is a good option if you feel like having a near-invincible boss monster. However, it lacks of good effects on field beside from being a large beatstick and using level 10 Synchro monster (that has more utility) as material is not justified.</li>  	<li><strong>Trade-In</strong> and <strong>Sacred Sword of Seven Stars</strong> can be used as additional draw engines. Trade-In is able to trigger Bigfoot's effect, while Sacred Sword is able to make use of unused level 7 monsters. Keep in mind that you'll need to slot in large amount of monsters with appropriate level, and these two will be a fatal brick if other stuffs in the hand don't match well (especially with Melffy package). It is also prone to Ash Blossom and other negations, leaving you with less hands than it used to be. Recommended to only insert 1-2 copies total.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> can be combined with a copy of Ursarctic Drytron to make a substitute tribute cost in GY that works similarly like Departure. The substitution effect can be used immediately after being sent to the GY, which is the combo's only superiority compared to Departure. It is better to use the slots for additional level 7+ monsters (especially going 2nd cards), since those monsters may have more utility while also serve as tributes for the bears.</li>  	<li><strong>Heavenly Zephyr - Miradora</strong> and <strong>Bahalutiya, the Grand Radiance</strong> seem to be a nice additional handtrap beside level 8 mega bears. After some testing, I felt that their effect is too mediocre and their summoning/activation condition is too inconsistent, making them end up only as tribute fodder most of the time. Thus, their niche status. Only slot them in if you think they're cool.</li>  	<li>Unlike the fellow dragons above, <strong>Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</strong> have a decent draw effect to refresh available options in your hands. Keep in mind that its summoning condition requires your opponent to play Link-based deck, which limits its usage.</li>  	<li><strong>Popular handtraps</strong> (Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre, Effect Veiler) and <strong>generic staples</strong> (Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, Dark Ruler No More!) can be used to replace going 2nd cards and Swordsoul package if you're more inclined to use their powerful effect. In exchange, adding them may hit the consistency of having enough Ursarctic tribute fodders due to higher ratio of lower level monsters and spell/trap cards, thus requiring you to tweak the deck's card ratio further. Recommended for current Master Duel builds or people with enough money irl.</li>  	<li>For further customization, you can increase the amount of these following cards by max. 1 copy by also replacing some cards/package you find redundant: <strong>Crystal Girl, Catty, Alpha, Gameciel, Vishuda, Eldlich,</strong> <strong>Big Dipper, Quint Charge, Desires (if the banlist allows), Bigfoot, Nessie, Hop Ear, Kerass, Chengying, Shuraig, Ravenous Crocodragon.</strong></li> </ul> <span>-- Gameplan --</span>  -- Early Game -- <ul>  	<li>Normal summoning Crystal Girl to start is the best opening move to bait out Ash/negations. Then, immediately use it as a Link material for Almiraj.</li>  	<li>Starting the turn by summoning Vishuda for free is another good opening move. From there, you can: 1) Get into Monk of the Tenyi if you're going second and want to chip away opponent's board using the bounce effect, 2) Summon a mega bear and use Vishuda alongside it to start the Ursarctic combo line by summoning Polari.</li>  	<li><strong><em>The base philosophy of the deck to make its first opening board is to keep it humble in appearance, while you have resources ready in hands and GY.</em></strong> For the field, have at least Polari and/or a level 7 mini bear alongside one other usable monsters (Catty, Ravenous Crocodragon, Qixing Longyuan). As for the hands and GY, make sure you have some quick effects or handtraps ready (level 8 mega bears, Hop Ear, Bigfoot for discard cost, Departure in GY for tribute cost, any bears as Slider's target).</li>  	<li>It is recommended to prioritize summoning Polari + set up Big Dipper in this first turn if you're confident on able to pull off without getting interrupted or having backup plays/extender in hands.</li>  	<li>Use Polari's effect to do one of these setups to finish the turn: 1) Revive one level 7 mini bear whose effect hasn't been used yet 2) Retrieve a level 8 mega bear to the hand 3) Revive a level 8 mega bear and use it to get into level 9/10 Synchro monster.</li>  	<li>If you're going second and have enough cards to summon and activate level 8 mega bears, it is a good idea to use them as soon as possible for interruption during opponent's first turn/opening play. Else, rely on going second cards if you have them.</li>  	<li>Trishula Zero's banish 3 effect is a decent option as last resort in attempt to break opponent's board.</li> </ul> -- Mid Game -- <ul>  	<li>Once you've found out what strategy opponent deck is using, use the ED monsters to deal with each case accordingly.</li>  	<li>Most of Level 9 Synchro monsters are better summoned during opponent's turn. Use their effects to remove opponent's key combo pieces or bring major disruption.</li>  	<li>Bringing out Chengying alongside Polari + Big Dipper is a good move to put pressure on opponent; Big Dipper's ticking counters and Chengying's banish effect will be annoying threats for opponent to deal with on following turns.</li>  	<li>Keep in mind to at least have enough stock of Ursarctic monsters and their fodder in hand (or GY if Big Dipper is active).</li>  	<li>Bring out Septentrion as soon as possible if opponent's cards indicate they're mainly using Xyz or Link strategy.</li> </ul> -- Late Game -- <ul>  	<li>Almost similar to Mid Game, but you'll rely on the byproduct from previous turns in the GY.</li>  	<li>Shensen revival should be easy to do once you've used up bunch of different cards; Keep the opponent pressured with its continuous banish effect.</li>  	<li>Tri-Brigade package can be a good last push to remove the remaining threat. Keep in mind to make it as the first play of the turn, since you'll be locked off from using this package after you summon any Ursarctic monsters from hand.</li>  	<li>Late game Chengying is a powerful finisher, especially after you've banished enough cards from previous turns.</li> </ul> -- Afterwords --  This deck recipe is my attempt to salvage the unique Ursarctic archetype by inserting bunch of happy accidental synergies, which do really help the archetype much by adding several layers of alternate gameplans. Even though the initial flaw of Ursarctic at its core still presents and limits the deck from reaching competitive-tier power level, I think I did my best to make the deck fun to use. I recommend you to use and try the deck in non-meta or casual play, especially if you're aiming to have fun, back and forth interactions.  Really, with all these non-Ursarctic cards, it does really feel like being an anime protagonist that can pull off new unpredictable strategies in every fight... Of course, not counting the brick rate and such.  Thank you for reading this far if you did. Again, please do try out the deck and comments with your test result for future considerations and update!  (Updated: Bumped up deck count to 44, removed 49-cards deck option. Tweaked the number of copies for cards in Melffy and Swordsoul package. Replaced one Ravenous Crocodragon with Wolfrayet in ED. Added Monk of Tenyi as main ED monster alongside write-up of its influence. Cleaned up some writings. Added Eldlich.)"

Surprisingly it was actually pretty nuts.  This build is engineered to be essentially a blind second otk deck using accesscode and unchained abomination, the deck is pretty nuts in action.  The combo for accescode and abomination (socketroll/copybokle and electlyrical world):  Activate world  grab socket or copy (whichever you don’t have)  summon socket  copy socket  summon third socket with the original sockets effect  link for cell  recycle socket  socket effect  link one of the non link appliancers for kappa  kappa revive the other appliancer  link soket and the other appliancer for virus swordsman  Summon zero day  link for berserker using the codebreaker stuff you have  beserker effect summon the other stuff  pop spells and traps if any  link cell with swordsman for abomination  link berserker and zero day for accesscode  pop and attack for game.  &nbsp;  If you run into me on Master Duel my tag is Crysgoyle (I liked the idea of a crystal gargoyle, and amorphage is apparently an illegal name due to words or something)  My ID is 495-405-702  if you want to find me  Have a good one!"

This Deck is fun to play and battle your opponent's strongest decks.  This Deck comprises Elemental Heroes, Vision Heroes, and Destiny Heroes. The main objective is to summon your Elemental and Destiny Fusion Monsters for the strongest effects and High Attack power.  The only weakness this Deck has is against negate cards since Heroes by themselves don't have to negate effects, and very few of them have counter to monster negation tactics. Still, this is a good competitive deck against decks in the Silver and Gold ranking.  I also added a few support cards if you plan on using Destiny Hero Plasma which is a great card to play when going first as he negates your opponent's monster effects, and with D - Force, he is an unstoppable beast."

Because <strong>Masked HERO Dark Law </strong>get them away from graveyard effects and just messes with there graveyard in general and, with <b>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer </b>send it to the gave plus an opponent card you can do some major damage to your opponent. Then when you add <strong>Evil HERO Malicious Bane </strong>You can destroy all monsters your opponent controls with ATK less than or equal to <strong>Evil HERO Malicious Bane</strong>, also it gains 200 ATK for each monster destroyed that way. plus if you can get <b>Vision HERO Trinity </b>out whos ATK doubles making it 5,000 ATK.  If you don't have / cant afford <strong>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer </strong>or <strong>Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier </strong>then you will want to get <strong>Destiny HERO - Dangerous </strong>and two <strong>Effect Veiler a</strong>nd only one <strong>The Warrior Returning Alive </strong>that will keep the deck at the same amount of cards and give you another hand trap  This deck can always do something to help even when it doesn't look like the best hand in the world. Defiantly give it a try and if you know a good way to improve on it let me know im always down to make my hero deck better."

Good amou","This is the ice barrier deck i have been playing for a while, Theory crafted over a few months The general strat is to get the stealth kragen out turn one using the revealer, Speaker, silent sea nettle and in a pinch you could use the deep sea city effect on a tuner or prior of the ice barrier. or if you get really lucky you can get out the crystal wing synchro dragon turn one, with usually a surface, hexa spirit and either a silent sea nettle or speaker. using the effect of hexa, making it level 3 then summoning gungnir, mid combo you can use its effect to destroy before getting out the crystal wing synchro dragon. I have found alot of success using the stealth kragen to prevent combos from being played and if that manages to get through you always have the ice barrier trap card as well as the torrential tribute and fury of kairu-shin to help out too. trishula you can get out any time with minimal combo of just using revealer, speaker and the effect of revealer to get speaker out. although it is possible with general wayne too you have a solid removal tool in santa claws as a smaller kaiju, now it does draw on end phase so best to remove. Kaijus i found are too high atk for any of our cards to do much, but it is well enough to be slapped down to prevent the effect! this deck is about recycling the cards used in the graveyard, so don't be scared to discard a few, as most turns you can get everything back out of the grave for what you used to synchro summon!  Side note, you don't always have to synchro summon, you can just keep defender of the ice barrier out as well as another ice barrier card to prevent them from attacking, especially if it is something scary!

Churn through the deck and make Link-4s without even ever normal summoning.,"""oh it's 50 cards"" shadup... this lets me run more bricks Gates of Dark World over Allure since barricadeborg blocker can tutor it, Dragged Down to The Grave over Dark World Dealings since if you're not stupid you can just set the stuff you don't want them to discard. It's also way more chad and a major flavor win with Called by the Grave  Can probably use more handtraps, this deck is pretty all-in on the combo. Again, 50 cards to maintain density of stuff you want to discard but also not just fold to any sort of interaction. Imperm is the handtrap of choice because you can ""hide"" it from your discard by setting it. You could argue for more, but this deck doesn't really need Halqi lines  Crossout Designator exclusively for Droll and Lockbird, that card shuts this deck down instantly, but I'm sure you can find other cards to use with Crossout. Prohibition is there for a similar reason, but it's just another thing to find with Barricade Blocker if you think the game is going to go that long.  I considered two Apollousa since this deck makes her extremely easily but ultimately decided Abyss Dweller is way better.  Number 46 because I'm poor and don't want to buy something more expensive than that for the Numeron engine, you can probably run something you can actually go into.  I considered number 68 but ultimately decided I wanted powercode talker. He's fantastic with accesscode and isn't terrible on his own either (although he's mostly a link climber and food for accesscode)  As with any deck, season to taste, this probably isn't the best build of this deck, but it's my take on it."

It's a fairly competent going second deck that can break through an opponent's first turn board and deal lethal damage on your first turn. The whole goal is to use your going second cards to pick the opponents field apart, summon Raviel or Hamon with the Sacred Beast engine, and use the Dangers to swarm the field and deal 8000 damage on your turn.  Now this is a going second deck, so in an ideal world you'll go second every time. I'll go over each card and some main combos and what to do if you're ever made to go first. Also your notice the small 10 card extra deck, this is exactly here to counter the Banquet Of Millions OTK whenever people get off that deck feel free to bring it up to 15 with whatever generic Links you like. <h2>The Main Deck:</h2> <strong>Chaos Summoning Beast</strong> - This card is how you get the Sacred Beasts out simple as that, this card is pretty easy to find and activate since it's effect tributes itself. Though it is very susceptible to Called By The Grave so keep that in mind. You can also banish this card from the graveyard to add Fallen Paradise to your hand, so this card is very important. Luckily it's super easy to search with the Sacred Beast cards. Finally do keep in mind this card's effects are all on a hard once per turn so if it get's negated, that's it.  <strong>Dark Beckoning Beast</strong> - This card finds whatever you need for your Sacred Beast combos, it's a great searcher and allows you to normal summon Chaos Summoning Beast once you have everything you need. Like with Chaos Summoning Beast this card is a hard once per turn and is pretty susceptible to interruption so keep that in mind.  <strong>Dark Summoning Beast</strong> - This card isn't super special, you can banish it from the graveyard to search a Sacred Beast and it can tribute itself to summon a Sacred Beast from your hand or the deck, but then you can't attack. It's really just useful for it's search effect or the rare occasion where you have to go first.  <strong>Raviel, Lord Of Phantasms</strong> - Your preferred win condition, you cheat it out with Chaos Summoning Beast and it hits really hard. It has an handy effect where you can tribute a monster you control to increase it's attack by that monsters original attack which helps you push for lethal. It also allows you to special summon a token when your opponent normal summons, but that rarely comes up. Also this monster has no inherent protection, so try not to have it on the field without Fallen Paradise as well or it won't last too long.  <strong>Hamon, Lord Of Striking Thunder</strong> - The back-up plan, you also cheat this card out like Raviel. It is able to burn your opponent for 1000 damage if it destroys a monster and sends it to the grave and that can help push for game. But usually Raviel is better at that. However, Hamon is good if your being made to go first and you can stick it on the field in defense with Fallen Paradise up. Then your opponent has to find a way to overcome it's 4000 defense with Fallen Paradise's protection since when this card is in defense your opponent can only target it with attacks. Also same as Raviel this it is very vulnerable without Fallen Paradise.  <strong>Danger!? Jackalope?</strong> - Pretty much all the Dangers are here for the same reason, they easily swarm the field for link plays and help you cycle through your deck quickly to find what you need. Jackalope's discard effect is really good with Raviel as you can summon Bigfoot or Thunderbird off it and turn the defense position Danger into attack points for Raviel.  <strong>Danger!? Tuschinoko?</strong> - Tuschinoko probably has the weakest discard effect besides Thunderbird but it still does guarantee a body for a link play or extra damage so it's better than nothing.  <strong>Danger! Nessie!</strong> - The searcher of the Dangers find whichever one you need in the situation you find yourself in.  <strong>Danger! Thunderbird!</strong> - Probably the weakest discard effect unless your facing exactly Eldlich then it can help clear out their backrow or force them to activate it prematurely. Other than that it's a big body to tribute for Raviel.  <strong>Danger! Bigfoot</strong> - Definitely the Danger you want to see the most, a big body for closing out games and a pretty good effect on discard. Popping a face up card is always nice.  <strong>Kaijus</strong> -Not going to give each Kaiju their own entry they all have the same purpose. They're here to blow up the opponent's board with Interrupted Kaiju slumber or get annoying boss monsters off your opponents field on their own. They also all have big bodies for Raviel's effect. Keep in mind there are only 4 in the deck so you don't really want to draw too many or search them off of slumber's effect or you'll turn slumber off.  <strong>Maxx ""C</strong>"" - The necessary evil of Master Duel right now. It's the only hand trap I play in the deck and I shouldn't need to say why. Make your opponent chose between giving you a bunch of cards and you blow them out or ending their turn early and you blow them out. I hope this card get's banned soon, and once it's done I'd probably replace it with Ash Blossom.  <strong>Fallen Paradise</strong> - This field spell is crazy. Gives all the Sacred Beast targeting and destruction protection limiting your opponents options to get rid of them. Then once per turn if you control a Sacred Beast you can just draw 2 Cards, which will definitely help you OTK your opponent.  <strong>Opening Of The Spirit Gates</strong> - This is a searcher just like Dark Beckoning Beast, lets you find whatever Sacred Beast combo piece you need when you activate it. However it has some other neat effects. You can discard a card to special summon a 0 attack fiend from the graveyard, combos really well with Chaos and Dark Summon Beasts. Then if you control a Sacred Beast you can add a continuous spell from the graveyard to the hand, which really only let's you recycle other copies of it and rarely comes up.  <strong>Allure Of Darkness</strong> - Let's you draw cards and you play lots of dark monsters. Pretty good card in this deck.  <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> - Dark Hole that let's you get a Kaiju on both your field and your opponents. Always give them Gameciel. You can also banish it from the graveyard to search a Kaiju, but you can't do that the turn you use this card so it rarely comes up.  <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> - Great going second card for blowing up all your opponent's monsters or their backrow, whichever is going to be a problem. Pretty self explanatory choice.  <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> - This is a newer card in the deck, but it's really here because of exactly Rhongomyniad. Otherwise it's just helpful for negating really annoying monster effects, halving attack points, and setting up your graveyard. <h2>The Extra Deck:</h2> <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> - It's basically here to let you send Chaos Summoing Beast to the graveyard for whatever reason. Otherwise it's on field effect can be useful in you find yourself in a pinch.  <strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> - An easy way to send Dark Beckoning Beast to the Graveyard, with a decent on field effect as well.  <strong>Knightmare Cerberus</strong> - Let's you pick off special summoned monsters in your opponent's main monster zone.  <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> - Let's you pick off spell and traps.  <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> - This card is really for when you're going first or your opponent stopped your Sacred Beast plays. Set it up with enough Material to make an Accesscode on your opponents turn and hope for the best.  <strong>Barricadeborg Blocker</strong> - Let's your recycle Spirit Gates or Fallen Paradise if they get destroyed.  <strong>Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion</strong> - This card helps you when you get a really bad starting hand. Let's you just mill whatever you need to the grave. Get a Chaos Summoning Beast so you can summon it with Gates, or banish to find Fallen Paradise. Or send Dark Summoning to find a Sacred Beast. Just hope you don't get unlucky with the random mills.  <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong> - Just get rid of one of anything your opponent has you don't like. And a great card to make Accesscode with.  <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> - If all else fails this card can win games by itself and it's really easy to make with all the swarming potential you have. Gives it self a big attack boost and can pop cards on the opponent's field. This is definitely Plan C but sometimes you get put in a position where this is your only win condition.  <strong>Underworld Goddess Of The Closed World</strong> - A good card for stealing cards on your opponents field, a bit harder to use than a Kaiju but can definitely catch opponents off guard. And it's on field effects can win you games against certain decks. <h2>The Ideal Starting Hand:</h2> In a perfect world you always go second and you want to open like this. At least 1 of either of Dark Beckoning or Spirit Gates, At least one of Chaos Summoning, Dark Summoning, or a Sacred Beast. And some Dangers or other cards to break your opponent's board. Let's go over some combos: Let's say your starting hand is:  Dark Beckoning Chaos Summoning Bigfoot Kaiju Slumber Jackalope Maxx ""C""  Once your turn comes probably start with Kaiju Slumber to wipe the board and get some Kaijus on the field.  Summon Dark Beckoning and search Spirit Gates. Activate Spirit Gates and search your preferred Sacred Beast. Then use Dark Beckoning's effect to summon Chaos Summoning. Then banish from the graveyard Chaos Summoning to search Fallen Paradise. Activate Fallen Paradise and draw 2 cards then just use your Dangers to amass enough presence and make links you want to win the game.  Now let's say your starting hand is:  Dark Beckoning Tuschinoko Bigfoot Kaiju Slumber Jackalope Maxx ""C""  Just Dark Beckoning isn't ideal but with Curious you can still go full combo. Summon Beckoning to find Spirit Gates and use Spirit Gates to find a Sacred Beast. Then use your Dangers to get enough Material for Curious and mill Chaos summoning to the Graveyard. Then you can use Spirit Gates to discard a card from your hand to get Chaos Summoning on the field and summon a Sacred Beast, then banish it for Fallen Paradise and push for game.  These Scenarios assume you never used your Maxx ""C"" but this is just some of the combos you can do in the deck. I definitely recommend just playing some games with the deck, there's a lot of combos you can do to win the game really quickly. <h2>Going First:</h2> If your opponent makes you go first then it's time to cry lol, but in all seriousness this deck isn't great going first. The best you can really do is try and stick Hamon in defense with Fallen Paradise up and/or I:P with enough material for an Accesscode or Unicorn. There's just not many options for a strong board going first so avoid it if at all possible. <h2>Conclusion:</h2> Well that's the deck, I'd love any advice or tweaks I could make to it and I'm completely open to answering any questions you might have about the deck.

Let's go to some analysis:  <span><strong>Strengths</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</strong> is there to use. It is simply a card that can help you to quickly activate <strong>Astrograph Sorcerer</strong> effect, which means that you can add 1 card that was destroyed that turn. Moreover, you can get to draw another card. Especially, except for the draw effect of Electrumite, the others are not once per turn. You can simply recycle it with the support of <strong>Metalfoes Mithrilium</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Metalfoes Alkahest</strong> can steal one effect monster (they will be frustrated lol)</li>  	<li>The effect of Metalfoes monster in your main deck can help you search all  Metalfoes spells and traps easily, and you will have more chance to fusion summon</li>  	<li>Endymion and Mythical Beasts monsters can help <strong>Magicians' soul</strong> activate its effect</li>  	<li><strong>Magical Abductor</strong> can help you search <strong>Magician's Soul</strong> or any pendulum monsters providing you can provide enough Spell counter for her</li>  	<li><strong>Magicians' Soul</strong> can help you draw card(s) when you are brick, or you can send <strong>Metalfoes Combination</strong> and <strong>Metalfoes Fusion</strong> to get some card advantages</li>  	<li><strong>Super Polymerization</strong> can shut down your opponent's combo easily lol...</li> </ul> <span><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Too dependent on starting hand</li>  	<li>If you cannot summon<strong> Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</strong>... Game over</li>  	<li>The average atk of this deck is not so good (main dmg from the piercing effect of <strong>Metalfoes Orichalc</strong> and <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>)</li> </ul> <strong><span>Summary</span></strong>  You need to have practice to master a deck, and this deck will take you lots of time to do that because the combos depend on your hand and your thinking way.  <strong><em>Thanks for spending time reading and having a look at my deck. I welcome all suggestions from you guys.</em></strong>"

","You always want to go second with numeron decks.  The strategie is simple; first you summon <strong>numeron network </strong>on the filed, you can search this card with( <strong>numeron wall, planet pathfinder </strong>and <strong>terraforming)</strong> then special summon 4 numeron monsters from your extra deck. Then use <strong>memories of</strong> <strong>hope</strong>( if you have it in  your hand) to draw 4 cards.  Attack your opponent monster and you won. If your opponent is somehow still alive, summon one link monster( you can choose any link monsters depending on your situation) and end your turn. The best link monster to summon in most situation is <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""><span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess (  you can negate your opponent monsters effect 4 times.)</span></h4> You can easily destroyed you opponent board  and get rid of their boss monsters with the <strong>kaijus, raigeki, lightning storm </strong>and <strong>harpie's feather</strong>.  You also have other cards like <strong>ash </strong>and <strong>infinite impermanence </strong>to interrupt your opponent plays.

What if I told you that these said nice things came in a form to be called one of the best structure decks since the pandemic? Well either we are truly in luck or we are just opted to not get set to the curb like we would've gotten as always. Alba Strike is the endgame of lore building, and competitive viability that US (the players) have at least tried to maintain in an age of darwinistic vitality. However for a $10 structure deck, it's veeeeerrry solid.  As usual, we are given at least 40 cards, but there is something interesting with this one. Besides <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance </a>and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> (which the latter of the two I did not play for this demostration), We are given 5 (Yes 5) powerful fusion monsters that actually do things. Also you have your familiar faces like <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdeis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdeis, the Knighted</a> and <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>. However what was unexpected was that they added pieces from Dragon Link in this Structure Deck: Mainly <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyvernburster"">White Dragon Wyvernburster</a>, and <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>. The support in this set that truly took this structure deck home however was the support for the ""Branded"" sub-archetype.  For one, we got the new fusion spell, <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> (which allows you to fusion summon a fusion monster using a ""Fallen of Albaz"" monster), and the new searcher <a data-name=""Springans Kitt"">Springans Kitt</a> (Which Special Summons herself if you control a Fusion monster listed as ""Fallen of Albaz"", then if successful can search out a ""Branded Spell/Trap that from your deck or that is Banished or in your GY). <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Mercourier"">Tri-Brigade Mercourier</a> is another new piece which acts as an archetype based negator, and if banished can search out <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or a monster with the name listed in its text. <a data-name=""Paradise Branded"">Paradise Branded </a>is basically just Magical Meltdown; but only activates it's search effects after you fusion summon your monster, and only with a ""Fallen of Albaz"", or a monster with the name in it's text (you still got that sweet anti-negate protection though, so that's nice).  As a sweet bonus, I mentioned earlier we get 5 powerful fusion monsters that were only expected to be released in core sets. First comes the original three of the lineup: that being Albion the Branded Dragon, Brigand the Glory Dragon, and Sprind the Irondash Dragon. However 2 news pieces of Branded support have been added into the structure for the sake of ""lore"" (or to increase sales the trust of structure decks had been falling off).

An infamous deck from way back in the days of old. Appearing first in Strike of Neos as a cute little beatdown deck but had something unique about them, if one was to be destroyed by battle you can choose a different six samurai monster instead which gave the deck a fighting chance against the might of Gladiator Beasts, and Lightsworns at the time. This deck also gave birth to some of the most infamous cards out there in the form of Legendary Six Samurai Shi En which is a soft once per turn spell/trap negate meaning if you had two or three of this chad out you could do 3 negates and combo that with Naturia Beast and Barkion at the time and the deck became feared. The next cards being the ever so loop heavy love couple of Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai as well as Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho. The big enablers of the infinite bushido counter loop amassing almost infinite counters to abuse with Mizuho also being a soft once per turn allowing you to just keep reviving your Shinai or Kizan for field clearing or FTKs with Amazoness Archer or Cannon Soldier. The third being Legendary Six Samurai - Kizan which is just a free non once per turn special summon from hand giving you access to free field spam and letting you go into a ton of synchro, XYZ, and Link plays. The final card being the infamous and still hated to this day GATEWAY OF THE SIX which every single time a six samurai monster is normal or special summoned place two Bushido Counters on it which if you build up enough counters lets you make an unbeatable almost unbreakable monster floodgate board but enough gushing about this deck. Time to say what the main field you want is.  &nbsp;  The main end field you want for this deck is- Apolousa with 4 counters, two Shi Ens for two spell/trap negates, a Great Shogun Shien (I believe this card is amazing this format with Adventure and Despia running around and he has priority so Despia Players can now cry when they can't resolve their Branded in Red, Branded Opening, and Branded Fusion all in the same turn), a Naturia Beast because of Non Once Per Turn spell negation so you can laugh in the face of Despia and Adventure package players when they can't resolve their Rite of Amersur (I don't know how to spell it), Faithful Adventure and for Despia their Branded Fusion, Theater, Red and Opening. The last monster slot can be anything if you play your cards right. I typically like to have either Break Sword or Shadow Shien in the last slot. The ideal spells would be Gateway and 2 Dojo or at least 1 Dojo and bith have a good number of counters on them in case I want to push for game and the last spell being a Divine Sword Phoenix Blade just as an additional power up to a warrior I control. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION. Another ideal monster for the last monster zone can be Secret Six Samurai - Rihan just as a surprise summon and because it is a banish opponents monster contact fusion (also because I think it would be based as fuck to summon)  &nbsp;  In the end, my build is just I consider to be more negate heavy. Hope you find this enjoyable to read and are more informed."

Once you are able to activate map (and usually reveal a Robina or Eglen, to be able to grab Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds without wasting a summon/search) and go into Empen, you are easily able to grab the Dreaming Town trap card and set up with a skill drain in Empen, and a near perfect floodgate with Stormwinds. The second Stormwinds is definitely a scum move, but for problem decks that can full combo after the barriers destruction, it might be necessary to bring the second Stormwinds to the field. You can use  the effect of Dreaming Town on their main phase (ideally after their normal summon) to grab Robina -&gt; Stormwinds,  to still further prevent them from making their plays possible. The deck has many fun combos to explore, and has infinite ways to get to the same board state. This deck is versatile, and at the ratios provided, I believe it has the lowest potential for a brick, and the highest potential to win. Remember. Deck thinning, is game winning."

Set up your Doomking negate with the Zombie World package. Also use glow up bloom to add Voivode to hand then kaiju summon Voivode using 2 of their monsters when Sucker is active, spawning 2 of their monsters to your side of the field and  rank 8 into Zombie Vampire with 3 materials (then overlay AA-Zeus!)  The main goal with the deck is to take control of your opponents monsters that might annoy you and keep them out of their reach. The deck makes great use of graveyard effects and can combo like crazy.  This deck is completely BONKERS to be honest! The only problem I've had really is a very slight consistency issue but I'm always open to trying other cards in here. Possibly Allure of Darkness."

Cybernetic Fusion Support also could aid this weakness: the effect is similar to Chimera. It is in side deck because of the traps I added (useful but there is plenty of choice). Obviously, at least two copies of Imperm can be inserted here instead of other traps. &nbsp;</p>"

Great for Advanced Players who can read the board and know the decks they are facing. In depth tutorial.,"This is a work in progress!  Quick introduction to me! My name is MoboFett, and I have been in and out of yu-gi-oh since I was ~6. My first deck was summoned skull and I fell in love with the deck, but eventually lost my cards. Around a 3 years ago my little brother had me get back into yu-gi-oh because my love for it when we were kids sparked his enjoyment for it. I struggled to find a deck I truly enjoyed and eventually found the Invoked archetype, and it quickly became a favorite. With a lot of testing and enjoyment from this deck, I then dug for means to make the deck compete with top tier decks and came up with the following. I hope to ever evolve this deck, and I hope this deck helps someone fall in love with the game,  This is a control deck with a lot of negation/destruction.  Generally you want to go first, but you can easily make this a 2nd turn deck.  Going first! You are looking to bring out some form of negate, and the strongest form of negation in this deck is Mechaba (This does not mean it is limited to just him.) The ideal starting hand includes Aleister the invoker, Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous, Invocation, Magical Meltdown, and Shaddoll Fusion. First bait out the hand traps with magical meltdown as this will only bring an Aleister to hand and prevent the negation of fusion summoning. If you notice they don't have hand traps then proceed to summon Aleister, and get another invocation ( you will appreciate this when you realize people will negate everything you do.) with Aleister, special summon  Artemis, use invocation to bring out Mechaba, then activate Eccclesia to special summon her to the field in defense postion and use her effect to search for dogmatika Punishment. You now 4 negates on the field (I'll explain momentarily.), and a free cannot be destroyed by battle with extra deck monsters. During your opponents turn you can then bully them with Mechaba, if they still try to do something use Dogmatika Punishment to destroy 1 of their cards, send N'tss to the grave and enjoy destroying one card on top of the punishment destruction, you can then use Fleurdelis as a hand trap to negate the effect of one face up monster your opponent controls. This deck typically will roll if the opponent does not understand your combos.  &nbsp;  Going 2nd is the same idea except you need to get maximus on field, to send psy-frame lor omega and N'tss to the GY and you have destruction and recycling with N'Tss. When I am more available I will extend this for more combos. I do not know how to add the tab that shows negates and boss monsters for decks as this is my first deck submitted."

Galaxy Serpent because no Normal Light Fairy monsters exist, Halq material.  Zera lets you add sanc for no battle damage. You can also use Zera while Mokey Mokey is on the field to destroy itself (No Sanctuary on field) to gain the Smackdown boost.  Burial from D.D for Eva Effect.  Swing and Wight since there is a lack of gy presence.  League of Nomenclature if your Smoke Ball or Mokey Mokey survives.  6 Prosperity Targets, The extra copies of spider, kuriboh, and almiraj can also be used for another pot if need be.  Halq for extra summons, Can also go into Wizard.  Spider to unbrick hands.  Wizard to double damage, or reset some of your damage from prosperity.

After that it is to lock down the board with the use of Skill Drain, and Macro Cosmos. Originally, I had in place 2 copies of torrential tribute, and 2 copies of Summon Limit. I have relegated the Summon Limit to the extra deck when you know you are going first in a game 2 or game 3 scenario. Torrential Tribute was completely removed from this decklist due to the fact that Tearalaments now exist. There are other options available that include Solemn Strikes and/or some Solemn Judgement cards instead if so desired.</p><p>The main cards you want to see and utilize is Weather Painter Snow, Snowy Canvas, and Weather Forecast. These cards are integral in how you pump out your end-board to take control of the game. Some cards are included to directly access the cards you desire in case you draw a brick. Pot of Prosperity is the new replacement for the original searcher for this deck (Piri Reis Map) since the new reprint of the Pot of Prosperity has allowed it to be much more affordable. This will provide you a much more consistent search without the drawback of cutting your life points in half and being Ash'd at the beginning of main phase 1. Terraforming allows access into a copy of your Weather Forecast field spell.</p><p>As other recent deck postings have stated before, this deck archetype was very slow in comparison to other decks in the current state of Yugioh. The archetype allows you to out-grind your opponent after setting up a board with Rainbow and 3 omni-negates. If you can't get through it then you are fighting a losing battle and you won't be able to beat it.</p><p>Post-DIFO support (Konami, please give us Weather Painter Red!): The new support is very welcome as it allows the deck to be quicker to establish control of the board. Moonbow itself allows it to freely float into Rainbow if it gets destroyed while being a bit niche as it allows your main Weather Painter monsters connected to its arrows to have the effect to temp banish your opponent's monsters until the next standby phase. If any of your Weather Painter monsters are banished when Moonbow is link summoned you can summon one of those Weather Painter monsters. Weather Forecast is an absolute unit of a card as it puts this deck on turbo mode to push out Rainbow/Moonbow, hopefully on turn 1 via the ability to use your Weather Painter spell/trap cards to link into Weather Painter Rainbow/Moonbow and then add in a normal summon of a Weather Painter monster to one of the arrows to gain their effects.&nbsp; With the ways things are there are multiple ways to support this archetype. The deck is not very strong going second so it is a good idea to have something to interrupt your opponent. Dimension Shifter allows significant disruption with the current high tier decks floating around that utilize the graveyard. Droll and Lock Bird can be an option to be put in this deck to limit the amount of resource gain your opponent can make. I chose to go with Effect Veiler to have access into a solid monster negate and an easy option into a big Accesscode Talker via the integration of the Selene package using an Aussa Charmer link monster. One other that comes to mind is also playing kaijus with a single copy of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. If your opponent slams a big monster on the field that can interrupt your plays, kaijus can come in clutch and knock your opponent's plans around and allow you to more freely get Rainbow out and re-establish control of the board.</p><p>Extra Deck: The extra deck is as follows to have 3 Rainbow and 2 Moonbow. If the need arises you can create Moonbow and on destruction float into a copy of your Rainbow. I feel that 3 copies of Rainbow and 2 copies of Moonbow is pretty balanced. The XYZ monsters are fairly straight forward. The idea is to sling out a Zeus through Fortune Tune and Downerd Magician.</p><p>Non-Weather Painter Link Monsters: 1 x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians 1 x Accesscode Talker 1 x Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable 1 x Knightmare Phoenix 1 x Knightmare Unicorn 1 x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</p><p>Knightmare Phoenix is to protect Rainbow before climbing into something like Underworld Goddess of the Closed World. One other card that came to mind in the creation of this deck was a specific extra deck monster, Topologic Zereboros. I had not included it in the extra or the side as I felt it could be a bit too situational but interesting nonetheless. If you utilize Macro Cosmos and/or Dimensional Fissure early on to have your opponent banish a lot of their cards, then it can be seen as beneficial to summon a monster that gains attack for each card banished. Along with that, Topologic Zereboros has the ability to blanket banish wipe out the board with a summon to one of its arrows and summon itself back to be a big boss monster. I am curious what others might think of the card and how it may interact with this deck but if it is too situational then I feel good regardless as to where I left the extra deck in its place. It is my first time submitting a deck here and I am curious what others might think of this deck setup and how it can be improved. Keep in mind I am an older player that got back into the game a few months ago after originally stopping in 2005 so I know I may have included some cards that are not as great as other cards that can be included in this deck and my descriptions may not be as well articulated as others.</p>"

Rather getting your cards get negate and popped with mechaba and DPE or skill drain and conq ? :p  the only card I can fear is evenly matched, banishing is not a great option in here (even tho I can pop DPE and a backrow to continue the card advantage)  Plus Accesscode is nice addition thanks to halq, and verte is fair and balanced lmao  &nbsp;"

Set the 3 Gift Cards.  Activate the Gift Cards during your opponent's draw phase, and if your using Bad Reaction, activate it last so it resolves in the chain first. Because of Nurse Reficule or Bad Reaction, your opponent will die instead of gaining life.  Because it's unlikely you'll get all 3 gift cards right away, there are plenty other traps to use the same way and also some spells. Most of the extra deck is just for Tri and Guess, but you can summon Utopia or Bagooska.  Have fun!"

So, the deck is a pretty simple, straightforward Tri-Brigade deck with a small Zoo splash. I'd call the deck aggressively midrange: Appollousa - Pass really shouldn't be as good as this is, but Revolt is an insane card. You also have some pretty wild combos, and often they rely on only 1 or 2 cards to have high impact, meaning we can jam good interruptions to fill out the roster. The Zoo engine is primarily for Zeus, which rounds out the going second plays, but being able to fill the GY with Beast-adjacent monsters for Tri effects is super clutch, and with Drident and Chakanine you'll often actually just use this engine to make Ferrijit while filling the GY. It does increase consistency quite a lot while improving your going second hands in general. The deck is the best deck in the format in my opinion, and it isn't even close - there are no extremely bad matchups, provided your interruptions are clutch, and even if you misplay bad the deck often has the pure power to push through for game anyways. You have to watch out for Trap based strategies when you're going second, and you have to really worry about strategies that can gain an enormous amount of advantage throughout a turn, like Prank-Kids for example, but the deck feels almost unstoppable going first, and pretty damn good going second.  Master Duel is a BO1 format, and that impacted the card choices. It is also a Maxx ""C"" format, which kind of makes a bunch of ulties basically mandatory. I feel like that actually serves this deck well, as Evenly is not commonly maindecked, not nearly as often as Harpies or Lightning Storm, which both can be obnoxious but are a far cry from a perfect answer. Evenly also isn't a perfect answer in and of itself. Hand traps are also kind of lower impact - Gamma doesn't mean much, Ash usually means less, and while Maxx ""C"" can be backbreaking the deck can make some plays without giving up too many free cards, which helps, depending on the matchup.  So, card choices.  3 Fire Formation - Tenki. This card is freaking nuts. So, with 3 of these and 3 Fraktall, +1 Rescue Cat we have 7 1 card starters for our Tri plays. But also, these double as more copies of our 4 Zoo monsters. I think they should probably limit this card, Tri is already pretty powerful without it, and this is the card that low-key pushes the Zoo builds way over the top. Rescue Cat is a better combo than just Fraktall, but in terms of mitigating the risks of interaction, I'd always rather see a Tenki or a Fraktall.  4 Zoo Monsters - 2 Thoroughblade, 1 Whiptail, 1 Ramram. The theory behind this is pretty simple - if I have to see 2 Zoo monsters, I'd almost always like to see Thoroughblade first, to mully while setting things up for a Chakanine. This is genuinely the maindeck zoo effect you will use most often. However, Ramram's Trap protection effect is clutch, if niche, and probably the best of the Zoos for when you're ending on Drident turn 1 just for its defense points. Whiptail makes the Zoo pile have another removal option built-in, but in reality I've used the ""attach as material"" effect more often than that. You could make a case that it should be 3 Thoroughblade or 3 Whiptail or 3 Ramram first IMO, depending on the meta. I think Thoroughblade is the best of them, but I like the utility of searching out the Zoos that are relevant.  3 each of each Tri (and a Kitty) - I've already talked a little bit about how Fraktall + Tenki + Cat gives 7 starters, but I really do feel like you have to max out on your  Tri monsters. With Almiraj pretty much any 2 Tris end up being full combo, so having high numbers of all of them are good. Also, you're sending lots of Tris to the GY, and banishing cards from the deck with Pot of Desires, so I do genuinely go through ALL of my tri names in a single game, sometimes.  3 Revolt - The best card in the deck. It is searchable off of Bearbrumm, and that's nice, but you'd almost always rather open it than search it, since Bearbrumm has some tough restrictions and also puts a card back into the deck. This is basically a Dinomiscus, except it generally adds 1 or more cards to your hand while setting up your GY instead of discarding a card. Nutty. Also, you can fire it off in response to Spell/Trap removal, to gain all that advantage and get ahead on the board. This card is wild.  2 Pot of Desires. You could maybe argue that I should be running 3, but tbh I've always found that even in decks where the first Desires is fairly ""free"", the second is usually not, and the third is dead. Yeah, you kind of want to open it more, but not at the cost of interaction or actual combo cards - the best part about the card is still that it is Ash bait. Still, this is a deck where Desires #1 is basically completely free almost all of the time, and where the second is often still pretty damn good, especially if you sequence your searches correctly. This is one of those silly cards, where on the one hand maybe they should limit it like in the TCG, but on the other hand you might actually be doing decks that run it a favour by limiting it. I like 2.  So, it's a Maxx ""C"" format, so we're on 3 Maxx ""C"" plus 3 Ash, plus 2 Called By for hand traps. Maxing out on the ""C"" seems obligatory - sometimes the card is a little bad or kind of dead, but it is game-winning when it resolves most of the time. The rhetoric for these numbers is simple - with 5 ways to answer Maxx ""C"" I am more likely to answer the Maxx ""C"" than they are to draw it, and by relying on Ash and Called By, these are really solid interruptions even if my opponent isn't on the insect. Meanwhile, I like free wins. Sometimes I draw 0 cards and the card still feels good. 3 Imperm fill out the hand trap suite, because Imperm is a hand trap that doesn't die to Called that is good for pushing through on your opponent's turn or your own, can't be negated by things that answer monsters effects, and is great as a generic Trap card to boot. If you're encountering more Maxx ""C"" than I am you could consider Crossout, but Crossout does require deckbuilding to be more centralized than it seems to be just on the ranked ladder - I'd be more inclined to play it in Tri in a competitive Master Duel event, but for laddering, it seems really hit-or-miss.  Lastly, we have a few tech options. I actually like Cosmic main a lot of the time even in BO3, but some kind of Spell/Trap disruption seems completely essential in BO1, and I think Cosmic is the best of the bunch. Solemn Judgment is kind of a pet card of mine, while Strike ends chains better, Judgment is just a good all-around answer that hits back-breaking Spells/Traps, while also answering most things that would hit the field in general. It feels really good here, since we're Apollousa spam and slightly weak to Lightning Storm, Harpies. I've used this on Twin-Twisters, I've used this on Harpie's Duster, I've used this on Boss Monsters, I've even used it on occasion just to kill Rotas in the absence of Ash. Very flexible card.  I think the Extra deck is pretty much completely optimized. You'd like 2 Bearbrumm or 2 Ferrijit or 3 Shuraig, but in reality, Accesscode Talker, Double Dragon Lords, and Almiraj are going to give you more ultility in the first 2 cases, and more consistency in the third case."

Prisma can act as a replacement for a Crimson Nova. This works in tandem with cards like Cubic Dharma, where you could discard Cubic Karma, bring the Crimson Nova that Prisma threw away back into your hand, and then banish the discarded Cubic Karma for the third (second technically, but Prisma changes its name) Crimson Nova. Then just use any poly card you have. Greater Poly is the best IMO because of the Piercing Defense, but the first effect if making it unable to be destroyed by card effects is largely useless because Crimson Nova Trinity already can't be destroyed OR targetted by effects. Super Poly is there just for shits and giggles to potentially make Starving Venom or any other Fusion you could throw in there. Fusion Conscription is there to search for Crimson Nova. Emergency Call can search for Prisma. Summoner Monk can summon Duza at the cost of a spell (you want to discard Cubic spells, especially Karma, since they have secondary GY effects). Duza can then throw ANOTHER Cubic card to the GY, which you would want to be another Karma (or any other Cubic spell/trap you want if you already have what you need to summon Crimson Nova Trinity).  Most of the Extra Deck (specifically Fusionist and Sanwitch) are there as fodder for Pot of Extravagance. Starving Venom can potentially be made, Tapir is for stalling, Zeus is there if (for some reason) you attack with Tapir, Linkuriboh is there for more stalling, Pentestag for piercing, and Verte in case you don't draw any Poly cards.  Crimson Nova Trinity is definitely the best card in the deck, and you should be going for it, but you don't necessarily NEED it to win. Crimson Nova on its own is already an amazing card and can dish out OTK's easily. Vijam can stall insanely well, and Cubic Causality can make stalling even easier, with both cards essentially making your opponents' monsters useless by putting Cubic Counters on them.

Side deck will need more attention, and extra deck is the best it can be, until more cards get release. The reason it is 42 and not 40 is because of Orochi. Having a 40 card build is very small when he's in the deck, also I will be adding a Drytron summon/effect list. By the Gizmeks having 50 in their attack it can be very hard calculating, however here are two to start with: Crystron + Deskbot = Drytron effect. Another one is Makami + Arakami = Drytron effect and summon. I did not add Pot Of Desires because I do not like the card, plus with Orochi your deck thins out very quickly! That's why Small World is a great addition to the deck! That card plus Naganaki make very good resources! Also with Naganaki and PSY-Framelord Omega; facedown banish cards does not effect you as much, so replacing Infinite Impermanence with Evenly Match would not be a bad idea. Another thing to keep in mind is that the babies (Inaba, Naganaki, Taniguku, and Arakami) banish face up. That is why Burial from a different Dimension is in the deck. Pot Of Acquisitiveness was in the deck, until I realize it is best to have your cards either in your hand, field, grave, or banish. In the deck is fine, but not as fine when you need a combo, or card. Also, Burial can target your opponents banish, so if your playing against a deck that use banish cards, or a card that targets banished cards you can chain it with Burial. Also Burial is up to 3 monsters while POA (Pot Of Acquisitiveness) is 3 monsters, so keep that in mind. The board I try to land on is Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, Hearld of Arc Light, and F.A Dawn Dragster. It is not the best broad, but it is the best we got, until Konami give us more support, or better generic extra deck monsters. All in all, it is very bittersweet when playing this deck. Every Gizmek has two effects and one of those effects are great! while the other one is not so much! Like the card Gizmek Inaba for example, seems like this card is suppose to be your starter, yet Konami made it have a ""when this card is normal summon"" instead of ""If this card is special summon or normal summon"" or ""If this card is normal summon"". I have yet to miss timing with Inaba, but one day it will happen! And when it does I might explode! Also, why special summon in defense!? If you're going to make me normal summon why can't I control how the other monster will be summon!? Another thing is that you can not combo with it with Naganaki. That would have made this deck VERY good! but a man can dream! you can combo Inaba with Yata. It is a weird combo, but it is one. Also, Inaba first effect is not once per turn, so keep that in mind. The second effect of Inaba hardly comes up because it uses the monsters ""original attack"" would have been better if it just said monsters attack, but a man can only dream. I gave up playing SowrdSouls for this because I wanted a deck of my own to play in meta. I never liked machine monsters, but Gizmeks name and look always got to me. Although, I spent a year putting in time, and money to make my dream of winning a YCS with a deck hardly no one plays, I am uploading this deck profile just in case I can not do it. My dream is not about me winning the YCS with a deck hardly no one plays, but for anyone can win a YCS with a deck hardly no one plays. I know! Better said than done, but hey! A man can dream!"

I haven't played since shaddolls, qliphorts and tellas were meta. I used to play a really fun deck that is known to be a great deck built right. Chaos Dragons has always been my favorite deck since I started playing when Dragon's Collide structure deck came out. I've been looking around for some viable options of builds for Chaos Dragons but haven't really found anything that has interested me until now.  I found this awesome video that I was very happy to see someone putting together a newer, more modern version of Chaos Dragons called Chaos Dragon Lightsworns. I've done it up a bit and have summitted an example of what I could play and played around with some good cards that could go well with deck.  Let me know if ya'll have any suggestions of how I could make it a little better. I really want to help revive Chaos Dragons.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Ka5wCclFI"

Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>“Why play this deck?”</strong></span>  <span>Well… if it still wasn’t obvious enough in most of the lists that I’ve posted, I love Fusion Summoning, and this deck features two decks that do both, being Despia and Shaddolls, and Dogmatika is always a great engine to be splashed with any Fusion strategy that needs LIGHT targets such as the two previously mentioned and of course, Invoked, but unlike the latter, this actually has a better draw power and can play a lot better around and through Ash Blossom. I’ll discuss the other intricacies further in the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Despia (<a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>, <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>)</strong> – <span>Your substitute to the Invoked engine. Does it play around Ash? Yes, and arguably better than Invoked. Is it better? Debatable. Here are their effects.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber </a>– <span>The successor to the best Normal Summon in the game, Aleister the Invoker. Allows you to search any “Branded” Spell/Trap from your Deck, much like his aforementioned precursor, and has a semi-relevant effect that Special Summons himself from the GY when a face-up Fusion Monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent’s card effect, to target and negate the effects of an opponent’s monster until the end of the turn. Not the best negation effect, but it’s better than nothing.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a> – <span>The semi-brick of the deck, since you don’t really mind drawing him though you’d still much rather search for him. Has an effect that Special Summons himself from the GY or when banished after getting used as Fusion Material while he’s in either your hand or field. Also has an effect that negates the effects of any targeted monster when a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster is Special Summoned, which comes up occasionally.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a> – <span>Your main searcher. Mandatory 3 of in any list that runs Despia cards, don’t believe anyone who tells you otherwise. There’s literally no reason not to run 3 of these. Upon getting sent to the GY or banished by a card effect, it searches you any “Despia” monster, which makes your Allure of Darkness essentially a +1 in card advantage. It also allows you to recycle your “Branded” Spells/Traps from your GY by banishing itself, although you can only use either one or its other effect once per turn.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• The Dogmatika (<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Fleurdelis</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Maximus</a>)</strong> – <span>Standard monster ratios for the Dogmatika engine. We’d have to run 3 Ecclesias since she also acts as a LIGHT Attribute Fusion Material, and because Nadir Servant is still at 1 for some reason. Just hover over their names to see their effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Shaddolls (<a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Beast</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Genius</a>, <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Ariel</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Hedgehog</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Falco</a>)</strong> - <span>Much like the Invoked variant, you only really want to run 1 of each of these, but run just enough so that you still have a pretty decent chance of drawing one of them if you need them. They all have pretty simple effects, so just hover over their names to see what they do.</span></span>  <span>Hand traps could literally be anything. <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash </a>is just generally good, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Veiler</a> is also great for being a LIGHT target so is either <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru </a>or <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Lancea</a> (which is also great for being a Fairy). It's really up to you.</span>  <span><strong>The Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong> - <span>Your main draw power. As I have stated before, is a +1 when combined with Despian Tragedy.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a></strong> - <span>A lone copy of this is still worth playing, since we're still playing Psy-Framelord Omega.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>One of the most revolutionary Fusion Spells in the game. A generally good splashable Fusion spell that people love crying about since it uses Fusion Materials from the Deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>Utility 1 of and GY setup. Also instantly triggers the effects of all your Shaddoll monsters and Despian Tragedy.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Makes pushing for game easier, dodges both Ash and Droll during the Draw Phase.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - <span>Hand trap protection.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher spell, and primary way of summoning Aluber. It discards as a part of its effect, so it also triggers your Shaddoll monsters, allowing you to chain block the Aluber you've summoned. Also provides your Fusion monsters a protection from destruction effects as a substitute by banishing itself from the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>Great removal spell, great combat trick, easily abusable by this deck due to it only caring about two attributes, which so happen to also be the most popular and ubiquitous ones in the game being LIGHT and DARK, only at a cost of discarding. This card has no reason to be at 2, but it's better than being at 1 or nothing.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - <span>Your main search target for Aluber. It's a Field Spell that's also a Fusion Spell. It also allows you to Special Summon any Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster from your GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster is destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>The (only two) Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a></strong> - <span>One of your revival spells. Allows you to negate multiple times with Apkallone, to revive Winda from the GY after getting outed, or to help you with the grind game by looping your Ariel and Falco. If you want added security for the grind, I suggest adding <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Hound</a> to loop this easier.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a></strong> - <span>The bane of every Special Summon that starts a chain, for its most popular application of allowing you to summon Winda during your opponent's turn, but is also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal, provided that you're summoning a ""Shaddoll"" Fusion Monster that shares an attribute with an opponent's monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>Note: I've made this semi-budget, because I'm still saving gems for the Darklord cards and more staples necessary for that build which I may or may not be sharing soon. I'll see.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - <span>A non-Despia Fusion Monster that is actually one of your best boss monsters. Provides all your Fairy monsters protection from targeting, which includes El Shaddoll Construct. Also allows you to Special Summon a Fairy monster from either your hand or GY during the Main Phase at a cost of 1000 LP, which includes El Shaddoll Construct.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Despian Fusions (<a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Proskenion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Quaeritis</a>)</strong> - <span>Proskenion is a Despia Fusion Monster that requires 3 Fusion Materials, including a LIGHT, a DARK, and a ""Despia"" monster. Allows you to either banish or steal an opponent's Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster from their GY (and it does not negate their effects). It also burns your opponent equal to a monster's original ATK or DEF when it destroys it by battle (whichever was higher). Quaeritis on the other hand only requires a ""Despia"" monster and either a LIGHT or a DARK monster. It also has an effect that allows you to modulate the ATK values of all monsters currently on the field to 0, except for Level 8 or higher Fusion monsters, which essentially makes your opponent's Apollousa useless.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Shaddoll Fusions (<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">Construct</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">Apkallone</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">Winda</a>)</strong> - <span>Construct, the once banned darling of Shaddolls, notorious for resource looping due to its non-once per turn effects and for its non-targeting combat removal. Apkallone, the newest addition to the family and is a very much welcome one, offers you a PERMANENT targeting negation, which not a lot of players are aware of, and an effect that lets you loop ""Shaddoll"" cards in your GY or search them from the Deck. Winda, the most infamous of all of them, she's the resident floodgate that a lot of players love crying about. Two of her is the minimum, even as just a splash for the Dogmatika engine.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Super Poly targets (<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>)</strong> - <span>Two of the best generic Super Poly targets, one being against the most common Attribute in the game, which is DARK, and the other for the weirder ones, mainly WIND, especially now that <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> is already in the game.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Essential for murdering your opponent's Extra Deck with the Dogmatika engine.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a></strong> - <span>A generic Link 2 for your Fairies.

I for one am happy about it, but of course, I know that a lot of people weren't, especially in a format where Verte Anaconda is legal, which gave them trauma from Fusion Spells that use materials from the deck, which is arguably the least of their problems, in a format where Artifact Scythe is legal. Regardless, expect this archetype to only get better over time, and don't listen to people who only trash archetypes because of how bad they were at first, especially if it's a Fusion strategy. There's really not much else to say about this deck that I haven't said already, instead as per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

The combos are pretty much the same: You activate ""Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda"", discard 1 Springans monster, summon ""Springans Merrymaker"", then, based on what you discarded and/or what you milled with Merrymaker, you can choose what to do.  The problem with the old version of the deck was the Great Sand Sea, because, without it in your starting hand or a way to search it, it was a 100% brick, but, thanks to ""Springans Kitt"" and ""Branded in High Spirit"", you can do an xyz summon with just one card. The only problem with this new deck are the handtraps. Cards like Ash Blossom, Artifact Lancea, Ghost Belle, Etc... literally kill this deck, so, cards like Called by the grave and Crossout can literally save your games.  This is just a for fun deck, and pretty budget too (Expect for F0 Utopic Draco that you can change with a lot of rank 4/8 xyz monsters), so, if you are a new player and/or you like Xyz monster, this deck is, in my opinion, perfect. Have fun guys!"

We use the Halqifibrax Auroradon combo for 2 extended combos and 1 base combo to put multiple negates on ,"In the current meta, add 3 Diviner of the Herald with 1 copy of Trias Hierarchia in place of the Cyberse package. The combo for the Diviner package: summon Diviner of the Herald and activate its effect to send Trias Hierarchia to the graveyard. Avtivate Trias Hierarchia's effect to summon itself from the graveyard by tributing Diviner of the Herald. Now, activate Diviner of the Herald's effect to special summon 1 Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from your hand or Deck. Summon Crystron Halqifibrax and go on from there.  This deck uses 2 extended combos, so choose which one you want to run. That's in Duel 1 &amp; 2. The cards for the 2nd extended combo are in the Side Deck. The base combo with one Deskbot 001 is in Duel 3. This deck is mainly a going 1st deck. We use Archlord Kristya in this build to lock Special Summoning. There are cases you might end up with more than 4 fairies in grave because you used one of the Heralds in hand effects. Pot Of Avarice could help with that at the end of the combo if you have it in hand. Other than that, they are extra fodder for Herald of Perfection. Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended is to protect you from hand traps.  https://youtu.be/CDiwDYEzLh4"

Use Poly or Fluffal Owl to fusion summon Frightfur Tiger, using your Edge Imp and at least 1 Fluffal. Use it's ability to clear your opponent's monsters and anything else that would stop it from attacking directly.  Use Frightfur Fusion to summon Frightfur Wolf using Edge Imp Sabres and 2 Fluffals as material. Wolf can attack 3 times, and gets a boost thanks to Tiger. Attack for game with both Frightfurs.  Fluffal Dog is in the deck to search Owl and Keeper of Dragon Magic gets you Poly. A bunch of negates stops your opponent from getting their ideal end board and of course the other fluffals are for fusion material.  Have fun!"

We are playing Despia with a small splash of Aleister because we didn't get all the Despia cards we wanted from this patch sadly. But we got our main boys and Fallen of Albaz which is insane. This deck is running 5 super polys essentially, fallen of albaz's effect is like super poly minus the ""Neither Player Can activate cards or effects in response."" it's still insane. First of all this is a turn 2 deck, if we go turn one we hope to open invoker as we really don't have many turn 1 strats besides opening the field with a super poly face down and <a data-name=""invoked mechaba"">invoked mechaba</a> to protect the backrow. This deck has 1 shot capabilities with <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> being able to come back after being used as materials with a whooping 3k attack but overall the reason I love this deck is how versatile it is with all our swiss army knife options in the Extra Deck. Since Master Duel is a best of one format having a plethora of extra deck options for every occasion helps in alot of ways. We run Artemis for Aleistar as we do not have many light monsters in the deck so this gives us a cheap easy way to get into Invoked Mechaba. Main boss monsters you want to get into are Despian Quaeritis and Despian Proskenion as they are very annoying to deal with for the Opponent. This deck still could use some ironing out as there are alot of cards I want to test this deck out with but Honestly it's been doing really well against meta decks so I wanted to share it."

Failing that, setting up a Guardian Chimera play with Branded in Red during your opponent's turn is a good fallback strategy as well. Remember that Ad Libitum can bring back any of your Despia or lvl 8 or higher fusion monster from the grave or banished in a pinch, so don't be afraid to use some of your boss monsters as fusion material in those situations.  Something else to stay aware of is the negation effect of Dragostapelia, making affected monsters lvl 1. This can be important for the Quick Effect of Quaeritis. Summoning Masquerade for decks that need to activate a lot of effects to set upa board can be and be a recipe for an easy win, especially for decks using the same Adventure engine. Like with any other deck, thinking through your plays beforehand and staying aware of as much as possible (field, GY, banished, deck, once-per-turns, etc.) for both you and your opponent is paramount to success. Keeping plays simple and making optimal choices will see you through to the end. Have fun and enjoy."

Drytron + Stein,"&nbsp;    After many months I was finally able to craft my Drytron-Stein deck with which I had been playing for several months on Nexus.  There are two ways to play:  &nbsp;  1 - The first way is by using lirilusc and the effects of Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom and Wind Witch - Crystal Bell. Causing 8000 damage on the first turn and thus victory.  2 - The second way is using Exterio , Apollousa and The Last Warrior from another planet , we can negate invocations and effects leaving the enemy in a difficult situation.  It's pretty simple. hope you like."

If the Tuner is <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion make sure you link chain Halqifibrax at 1 and O-Lion at 2 to protect against Ash. </a></li>  	<li>Jet Synchron into Salamangreat Almiraj then use jet Synchron to get into Crystron. (this will alter how your turns are played throughout the game though. Which is why I think adding Deskbot 001 and removing 1 O-Lion might be the move)</li>  	<li>any level 7 or lower monster summoned into <a data-name=""Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson</a></li>  	<li>Any monster with Tenyi Spirit - Adhara special summon</li>  	<li>Tenyi Spirit Vishuda or Ashuna special summon, Link into Monk of the Tenyi, then Special summon Adhara.</li>  	<li>Last but not least the most Obscure way would be summoning any tuner monster and having your opponent <a data-name=""effect veiler"">effect veiler</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> it then using <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>'s effect to special summon it to the field.</li> </ol> 1st Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax , This will allow you to search out </a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> which is you're main tuner to enable the combo. (</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> can be replaced with </a><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> if you wish) </a>  2nd Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, This will allow you to get 3 lv 3 tokens which will be important. </a>  3rd Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing , Use Auroradon's ability to sac 2 tokens(if you have a monk of tenyi on the field if not you want to sacrifice Auroradon and a token) to summon </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion. You then will synchro summon into </a><a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing which doing so two triggers happen, stack Denglongs trigger first and follow it with </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion's effect to protect against Ash. You want to grab </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> with Denglong's effect. Then you want to use Denglong's activated effect to send a level 7 tenyi to the grave, if you do not have </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> in the graveyard send her. This will make Denglong into a level 7 tuner. </a>  4th Objective of this deck is to make Baronne De fleur, Synchro summon using the level 7 <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing and 1 level 3 token to make De fleur. Denglong's effect will activate when sent to the graveyard which in most cases you should grab Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing and set in defense position. </a>  5th Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi , Remember sending Ashuna to the graveyard? This is why, we need to activate jet synchrons effect to summon him back to the field first because if you activate ashuna first she will stop you from special summoning anything that isn't a Tenyi Monster. Then Remember why we sacrificed the link 3 instead of the token? because we need the token to activate ashuna. So now you activate Ashuna from the grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi""> from the deck. Use Vishuda and jet synchron to make </a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>  Now unless your opponent has a ton of board breakers they now have to face against 2  Omni Negates and 1 Semi Monster Negate. This deck produces another Omni Negate if you open with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> or <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> as you send <a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing to the Graveyard. Doing this means when you use </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing on your opponents card and destroy </a><a data-name=""Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing"">Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing, when you special summon </a><a data-name=""Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing"">Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing you can also bring back </a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing""> from the graveyard and with Bi'an's effect synchro summon on your opponents turn into </a><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light.</a>  &nbsp;  As you can see the deck if very good and I urge everyone who is sick of being a Meta Slave to give the deck a try!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

If the Tuner is <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion make sure you link chain Halqifibrax at 1 and O-Lion at 2 to protect against Ash. </a></li>  	<li>Jet Synchron into Salamangreat Almiraj then use jet Synchron to get into Crystron. (this will alter how your turns are played throughout the game though. Which is why I think adding Deskbot 001 and removing 1 O-Lion might be the move)</li>  	<li>any level 7 or lower monster summoned into <a data-name=""Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson</a></li>  	<li>Any monster with Tenyi Spirit - Adhara special summon</li>  	<li>Tenyi Spirit Vishuda or Ashuna special summon, Link into Monk of the Tenyi, then Special summon Adhara.</li>  	<li>Last but not least the most Obscure way would be summoning any tuner monster and having your opponent <a data-name=""effect veiler"">effect veiler</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> it then using <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>'s effect to special summon it to the field.</li> </ol> 1st Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax , This will allow you to search out </a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> which is you're main tuner to enable the combo. (</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> can be replaced with </a><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> if you wish) </a>  2nd Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, This will allow you to get 3 lv 3 tokens which will be important. </a>  3rd Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing , Use Auroradon's ability to sac 2 tokens(if you have a monk of tenyi on the field if not you want to sacrifice Auroradon and a token) to summon </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion. You then will synchro summon into </a><a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing which doing so two triggers happen, stack Denglongs trigger first and follow it with </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion's effect to protect against Ash. You want to grab </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> with Denglong's effect. Then you want to use Denglong's activated effect to send a level 7 tenyi to the grave, if you do not have </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> in the graveyard send her. This will make Denglong into a level 7 tuner. </a>  4th Objective of this deck is to make Baronne De fleur, Synchro summon using the level 7 <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing and 1 level 3 token to make De fleur. Denglong's effect will activate when sent to the graveyard which in most cases you should grab Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing and set in defense position. </a>  5th Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi , Remember sending Ashuna to the graveyard? This is why, we need to activate jet synchrons effect to summon him back to the field first because if you activate ashuna first she will stop you from special summoning anything that isn't a Tenyi Monster. Then Remember why we sacrificed the link 3 instead of the token? because we need the token to activate ashuna. So now you activate Ashuna from the grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi""> from the deck. Use Vishuda and jet synchron to make </a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>  Now unless your opponent has a ton of board breakers they now have to face against 2  Omni Negates and 1 Semi Monster Negate. This deck produces another Omni Negate if you open with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> or <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> as you send <a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing to the Graveyard. Doing this means when you use </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing on your opponents card and destroy </a><a data-name=""Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing"">Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing, when you special summon </a><a data-name=""Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing"">Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing you can also bring back </a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing""> from the graveyard and with Bi'an's effect synchro summon on your opponents turn into </a><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light.</a>  &nbsp;  As you can see the deck if very good and I urge everyone who is sick of being a Meta Slave to give the deck a try!"

[April 2022],"<span><strong>Overview</strong></span>  While Darklords were good before, they just got even better with the addition of Despias. We didn't get <em>every</em> piece of support for Despias, so this decklist will be subject to change for the future whenever it gets added. Why combine Darklords and Despias together? They complement each other! Aside from most of everything being Dark-Fairy monsters, Despia's fix the consistency issue that Darklords have, and Darklords in turn help swarm the field and carry out OTKs with their high attack points. In addition to that, the main tech card I use is <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> . This card is a floodgate; it locks everyone out of special summoning- and more often than not will be an auto win if you can get it out whilst going first.  <strong><span>Pros and Cons</span></strong> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Consistency </span></li>  	<li><span>High search and draw power</span></li>  	<li><span>High potential to OTK</span></li>  	<li><span>Ability to lock the board down</span></li> </ul> ------------------------------------------------ <ul>  	<li><span>Weak to effects that banish cards</span></li>  	<li><span>Very little spell/trap removal and negation</span></li>  	<li><span>Difficult to recover if your board gets broken</span></li> </ul> <strong><span>How Consistent?</span></strong>  Your opening hand is very important since this deck has a tough time recovering later on if needed. Out of 100 opening hands (assuming going first with 5 starting cards) these were the results:  Good Hands: <strong><span>65/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>65%</span></strong>)  -- hand has multiple draws and searches that could allow playing through handtraps and other negates.  Okay Hands: <strong><span>26/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>26%</span></strong>) -- hand has a tech card or handtrap(s), but still has potential to search and draw.  Bad Hands: <strong><span>6/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>6%</span></strong>) -- hand has very little or risky options (ie. allure of darkness and no dark monsters).  Dead Hands: <strong><span>3/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>3%</span></strong>) -- can't do anything, forced to end turn.  Overall, pretty consistent with only around a 10% of not having at least a decent hand. In general this deck performs better going first compared to second, but can function fine going second if needed.  <span><strong>Key Cards and Combos</strong></span>  <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> - Functions as both an extender and card destruction if used as fusion material for <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> . Can combo with <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> where it can swarm Darklords to your field depending on the number of effect monsters on your opponent's field. Can also be used as an <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> target if there are no better options.  <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> - One of the best Darklords in the deck. She does 3 things: draw from the deck, set up the grave, and can copy Darklord spell/traps from the graveyard. Depending on which spells/traps are in the grave, she can effectively be an extra searcher/extender/negation.  <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> - Summons itself to the field when used for fusion material and is a negate to anything summoned from the extra deck. Can be very useful for going into Rank 8 xyz monsters.  <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - The best extender in the deck since its revival effect isn't once per turn. You do need to be careful not to miss the timing on the revival effect- quick effect copying a <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> from the graveyard will cause you to miss timing as well as using <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> 's revival effect during a chain. To avoid this, use your revival effects from the hand and not during a chain. Superbia can also revive <strong>any</strong> fairy monster from the graveyard, including <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> for synchro plays.  <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> - Your main floodgate of the deck; prevents both players from special summoning. More often than not- if you can manage to get Kristya on the field turn one while going first, it's an auto-win. If you're going second- you can also use Kristya as fusion material from the hand for your Despia fusions.  <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> - Your best searcher in the deck to search for your Despia spells and also has a graveyard effect.  <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - Bit of a double edged sword since she gives your opponent a monster, but also functions as a decent searcher for Ixchel, Superbia, or Morningstar. Ideally would want to give your opponent <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Nergal"">Darklord Nergal</a>, or one of your Superbias. I don't currently run this in my deck, but she also combos pretty well with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> . Keep in mind you are locked into only Fairy effects for the rest of the turn after using her effect.  <a data-name=""Darklord Nergal"">Darklord Nergal</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> - Nergal has the same copying effect as Ixchel and also gives you piercing damage while Capricious powers down your opponent's monsters when it gets sent to the graveyard. These are tech cards that can be substituted if needed. Bit situational, but I have won duels by beating over 0 ATK/DEF monsters.  <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> - The only handtrap I currently run in this deck, it can protect your searchers from other handtraps and set up the grave. It's also a Light monster that can be used for Despia fusions. It also combos <strong>extremely</strong> well with <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> .  <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> - Your best target for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> since it turns the card into a +1 for your hand. It can also recycle your Despia spells back to your hand if your field spell gets destroyed.  <a data-name=""The Sanctified Darklord"">The Sanctified Darklord</a> - The only trap I run in this deck; it adds a bit more control and LP recovery. You can also use this trap on your own <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> so that you can special summon monsters during your own turn. This can also be substituted for any other Darklord trap of your choosing. <a data-name=""Darklord Rebellion"">Darklord Rebellion</a> is a good alternative if you want more spell/trap removal.  <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - Your main beater and extender. Being able to summon him became insanely easy because of <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> . He can potentially board wipe your opponent if you use Morningstar as material, else he makes an excellent extender being able to summon <strong>any</strong> fairy monster from the hand or graveyard. A good way to surprise your opponent is to quick effect summon <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> during their turn.  <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> - Reduces the ATK of any monster that isn't a level 8+ fusion monster down to 0. You can combo this effect with Numeron Dragon for an OTK if you aren't locked into only fusions for the turn. This effect can also combo with Apollousa where her ATK will reset to her original value even after having lost ATK from negating.  <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> - A very powerful synchro monster as long as you aren't locked into fusions or fairy abilities for the turn. Ideally you want to summon her with <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> . During your standby phase you can have her recycle Superbia from the grave- and it will in turn revive Orange Light from the grave as well and you'll be ready to summon her again. You can effectively loop this into summoning her during your turn for a free card pop and omni negate.  <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> - As long as you aren't locked into only Fairy effects for the turn, this card can help facilitate you summoning <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>. The draw 4 is too good to pass up since there isn't an easy way to search Kristya.  <strong><span>Other Options</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>If you aren't keen on using <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> , <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> is a good alternative since it's also a light monster (and a tuner).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> can combo with <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> and is a great going second card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> is another good hand trap to consider if you have the room for it. Keep in mind- the more handtraps you run, the more often you will brick; this type of deck relies on having plenty of resources.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> can be added to make up for the lack of spell/trap removal.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> can help prevent your cards from getting banished. Despias usually don't mind being banished, but Darklords can't do anything while banished.</li> </ul>"

Crimson is the best one here in my opinion, being able to almost singlehandedly summon Red Supernova Dragon on the first turn (if you don't get interrupted, of course). Red allows you to summon a 4* to pair to go into Red Rising. Synkron and Creation can special summon themselves. Chain can be used as intended if you want, but I use it as Light-attribute banish fodder for Chaos Ruler. You can replace it with basically any other Light monsters, even a Kaiju if you wanted to just have that at hand. Wildwind can special summon itself when a Resonator is on the field.</span></li>  	<li><span>Assault Mode - The Assault Mode engine allows for some really quick and easy synchros, and works even better alongside Resonators. All the cards are pretty self-explanatory. Psi-Reflector can search and special summon Assault Mode monsters from the GY and manipulate their levels to go into the exact synchro you want. It's a lot more consistent than relying solely on Resonators, which can occasionally brick. Emergency Teleport is to get out a Psi-Reflector when you don't have it in hand.</span></li>  	<li><span>Other Main Deck Monsters - Iron Dragon Tiamaton is there as a level 4 that special summons itself. It also has a niche but cool column destruction effect whenever it's summoned. You can replace this with something like Witch of the Black Forest (searches after going from Field to GY) or Skull Meister (level 4 GY-negate handtrap). I don't find those necessary as I feel the deck has enough searches, and Called By is just a better Skull Meister. If you want you can throw in a Kaiju, I would recommend Radian (level 7 Dark Fiend) or Thunder King (level 9 Light Thunder). Radian is better because it has low stats but Thunder King can be used as banish fodder for Chaos Ruler. Hydride is there to be summoned by Halqifibrax, I'll explain that later. Of course, I also run 2 Ash and Maxx C. </span></li>  	<li><span>Spells &amp; Traps - Resonator Call is self explanatory, it searches for Resonators. Emergency Teleport is there to get out a Psi-Reflector for the Assault Mode engine.  Burning Soul is so you can Synchro summon on enemy turn if you want to, and it also provides targeting protection for Level ≤8 Synchros. It also fetches a card from the GY to your hand, so if you want to reuse a handtrap or if Chaos Ruler milled something like Assault Mode Activate or a handtrap, you can grab those back. Assault Mode Activate is just there for the Assault Mode engine, you'll never actually be placing it down. Imperm is a generic negate trap. Red Reign is absolutely amazing and self explanatory, it's a monster banish wipe except for the highest level monsters. </span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><span>Extra Deck - Samsara is there for coverage in case all you get is something like Synkron/Chain and Wildwind, or if you want to do some funky stuff into Supernova (I've done it a couple times, it's nice to have). Red Rising starts up most of the summon spam combos when not using Assault Mode. Scarlight is the basic Level 8 to go into cards like Abyss, Bane, King Calamity, Nova, or Supernova. Chaos Ruler can excavate the top 5 cards of your deck, take 1 Light or Dark monster, and then send the rest to the GY (which really isn't a bad thing in this deck, as a lot of cards have GY effects). Abyss is a free once-per-turn negate and can summon Resonators when it does damage. Bane can tribute a monster to summon a Red Dragon Archfiend monster from the GY, and can also summon Resonators when it does damage. King Calamity and Red Supernova are the powerhouses of the deck. In terms of how good they are, I think King Calamity &lt; Red Supernova. Red nova is a pretty simple big beatstick, but it can't be destroyed by card effects and can negate an attack by temporarily banishing itself. King Calamity stops your opponent from activating cards the turn it's summoned. When it destroys a monster by battle, it does burn damage equal to that card's attack, which means if that monster was in attack position, you'll always be doing 4000 damage. It also revives a level 8 or lower Dark dragon Synchro when it dies so you won't be left open. Supernova is by far the best card in the deck. Huge beatstick that can banish wipe your opponents' entire field, and bring itself back in your next end phase, and as a cherry on top, it can't be destroyed by card effects. King Calamity has an advantage though, where because of the lockout effect, you can use Burning Soul or Shooting Riser to summon King Calamity during your opponents turn and completely lock them out of everything. You can replace Burning Soul with something like Synchro Call or Synchro Transmission if you want, I just like Burning Soul because it adds a later of protection in case I use it during my turn or if King Calamitys effect somehow gets negated. Halqifibrax is there for the dreaded all-Tuner brick hand. This way, at the very least you'll have a way to get at least 1 solid monster out. Get 2 tuners out, summon Halq, summon Hydride, then during your opponents turn proc Halq to summon Shooting Riser (Do / don't use it's effect, all depends what you want to go into) and use Shooting Riser + Hydride to go into either Baronne (if you didn't use Risers effect) or Chaos Ruler / Scarlight (if you used Risers effect and dumped a level 2). </span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>Side Deck / Replacement Cards - Most of these are just cards you can use to replace things you either don't have or don't want. Hat Tricker is an easy-to-use card you can just throw in there. Nibiru, Solemn Judgement, Lightning Storm, and Feather Duster are all good and generic cards if you want to switch things around (for example using CBTG instead of Skull Meister). Ancient Pixie and Zeta are both good level 7 Synchros in case you somehow brick with only something like Creation and Wildwind. I don't run these because it's such a small chance of that being your only play that it's negligible. Beelze and Dark End Dragon are both good replacements for Scarlight if you're not planning to run Nova (not a super important card anyway), especially Dark End Dragon. Dark End sends cards to the Gy rather than destroying them, which bypasses cards that ""can't be destroyed"". You can run Tyrant if you want to, I only run 13 cards because of the current D.D. Dynamite deck going around. Nethersoul Dragon is also another good Level 10 if you want one, with a plethora of good effects. Now, if you want to be really annoying, you can technically run the Very Fun Dragon. Abyss works as one of the level 9 materials, and you can either summon a second Abyss or run the Trishula fusion by banishing monsters, no poly needed so you don't need to change main deck cards around. But you'd have to somehow get 2 Abyss' out on one turn, then somehow have both of thems survive until the next turn where you'd XYZ summon. Not worth imo especially because you'd be cutting down the rest of your extra deck.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Overall a super good and super fun deck. The previous deck I made got me to Plat, and this one's even better.</span>"

And I decided to copy his play stile of the deck and combine it with the actual Dragon Rulers, and voilà, Floodgate Rulers.  I think, this would be the best way to play the Dragon Rulers in a pure version of the deck, if all came to 3 copies.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

A small Rokket package is included so that if you start with an above average hand, you can use <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> to search a <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong> to pitch an <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> to search a <strong>Rokket</strong> <strong>Tracer</strong>. By that point of the combo, you should have already gone into <strong>Striker Dragon</strong> for <strong>Boot Sector Launch</strong>. Only thing to do is to link off <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> and another Dragon into <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</strong> to have a link in the GY for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>.  Important thing to note with the deck are the Small World bridges. Only ones you super need to worry about are making sure the second card is a <strong>Black Metal Dragon</strong> or a <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong> since that basically searches your entire deck."

Effectively, if you can summon 1 rank 4 + an extender, you have a board with 3-4 effect negates, 1 omni negate, 0-1 spell/trap negates, and 2 disruptions. It's gross, and super fun.  But, these builds struggle against any sort of interruption of your normal summon (ideally, this is regulator). That's why we run the gamma engine and called by. Is that enough to keep up with today's metagame? Absolutely not.  So, how to fix this? Take some inspiration from D/D/Ds and pendulum summon you some dark monsters to victory. We keep the deck super slim, running 4 spells and traps (all except 1 is searchable, how's that for consistency?). We also run Danger! Mothman to help unbrick your raider's wing/bezel ship, and Armageddon knight to dump one of those two after a pendulum summon (or normal + raider's wing). Even better, we have Curtain Raiser as a free special summon that can also be pendulum scaled with Supreme King Gate  When going second, they're probably going to s/t removal, so just get rid of the pendulums for some board breakers (which can include Forbidden Droplet/Lightning Storm, if you pay that much for cardboard). As an added bonus, D.D. crow is another dark winged beast, in addition to helping with scythe locks, this deck's worst enemy.  In the extra deck, the high level raidraptors can easily be subbed for abyss dweller/tornado dragon. Lambda can also be subbed for Omega, but searchable gamma is very nice.  This is budget AF, is super fun to play, and has great thematics behind its cards. Give it a spin."

This is an OTK deck that wants to Go Second, interrupt of break your opponent's first turn plays and run them over in turn 2.  The deck's main goal is to attack with a 6000 ATK <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> with an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a> as material, supported by <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a>, for an untargetable, undestructible OTK.  <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a> can be Link Summoned by tributing any 1 Infinitrack monster and can be sent to the graveyard to trigger its attach effect by either one of the Level 5 Main Deck monsters, any of the Xyz Infinitracks already in the GY, or by linking it up to a <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a>. You want to have a <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> already summoned when you do this, something the whole deck is designed to turbo out in any way possible. Then you can Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> on top of the Gustav Max, activate its effect and attack for game. There are also a lot of handtraps and backrow removals to help you clear any inconveniences before you begin your plays.  <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is here to help deal with the meta's most annoying turn-1 play, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>. Swordsouls always have a <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> on the field as well, our <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> can use both of them as materials and is also Level 10. Despias have <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a>, our <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> can use both of them (or another Despian if DPE is not on the field). <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a> is the only guy that can see <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> as material and is remotely possible to be Fusion Summoned. Even if you draw <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and there are no valid plays with it though, it can either bait an opponent removal effect or be used as discard fodder for <a data-name=""Revolving Switchyard"">Revolving Switchyard</a>.  Note 1: Be aware that although <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a> is a great piece of support for your Xyz Machines, its Rank-Up effect restriction can lock you out of <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>, <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. It can always be activated after these cards though, without problems. <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a> has the same restriction on its search effect.  Note 2: There is a Side Deck section in this deck that lists a number of handtraps. These cards have all been tested and proven less useful against the meta, but they're still quite strong, and more importantly, they're quite strong against us. If you find yourself losing to any of them consistently, you can add a single copy of them into the deck as a target for <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>.  <strong><span>May '22 Changelog</span></strong>  It's the <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> era, and we have to adapt to it. Also, Swordsoul and Despia decks are everywhere and they're annoying, so it's time someone punishes their hype. - <a data-name=""Ruffian Railcar"">Ruffian Railcar</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede</a> have been removed from the deck. They are both too slow for the current format. Both ended up just serving as <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> targets, but since neither can link into an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a>, they were suboptimal even then. - <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> went up to 3. A better <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> target that the two above, also its NS effect can become a lot more relevant due to other additions in the deck that block <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a>'s self SS effect. It's now the second main NS of the deck. - <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Night Express Knight</a> cut down to 1. Takes up the NS of the turn, which is suboptimal and slows down the deck, also room was needed for more handtraps. Stayed to 1 instead of being removed completely because it's still a target for <a data-name=""Revolving Switchward"">Revolving Switchward</a> in a handtrap heavy opening hand that needs a way to trigger one of the other two Level 10 SS. - <a data-name=""Infinitruck Tunneler"">Infinitruck Tunneler</a> removed from the deck. It was the least useful Level 5 Infinitruck and the space was needed. - <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a> down to 1 and 3 <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> added. Outrigger is searchable and its searcher is also searchable. Heavy Forward is 3 more <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a>, or any other Infinitrack if you already have the short dude. - <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> have been removed from the deck. While still exceptionally good cards, I have noticed them impact less games less heavily in the current format. Also read ""Note 2"" for more on this. - 2 <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> added to the deck. These are mainly handtrap protection, they support the OTK capabilities of the deck immensely. <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> can also interrupt plays and remove <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, albeit after its destruction effect. <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> can block any card you happen to have in your deck, and since we also play a heavy amount of destruction spells, this is probably the most useful handtrap in the deck now. - 2 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> added to the deck, along with 3 Fusion and 1 Link targets, <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> and <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>. This engine is the best board breaker of the current meta. Let's admit it, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> is everywhere now. <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> is the heavy lifter against Swordsouls, since they also go to a <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>, he can use both of these as materials. <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> is the star against Despia and can also out the Enforcer in any deck that brings him with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, since they're both Dark. <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a> coupled with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> can out any Link monster (I'm looking at you, <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess)</a>. Almiraj does need either a normal summoned <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a> or a <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Night Express Knight</a>, so there goes the turn's NS. - 1 <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a> added to the Extra Deck. There will be a lot of times that you'll end up with both an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> and an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a> in the field. Using either of their on-field effects on the other can result in a Rank 6 play, and this dude can block a negate/destruction monster effect to help you get to <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> easier. It does block <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a>'s ability to SS itself though, so keep that in mind (and hence 3 <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a>s now in deck). - Cyber Dragon engine removed from the Extra Deck and Infinitrack Goliath went down to 1. There are only 3 Level 5 Infinitrucks in the deck now, and our first Rank 5 play is always through an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a> search that restricts us to Earth Machine monsters. It was rarely used and the room was needed. A second Goliath was also rarely used, and the deck can live without it if it already went through enough interruption to be able to use it. Again, room was needed."

Updated!!,"So... this thing has a lot of nasty cards such as:  Vanity's Fiend  Vanity's Ruler  Majesty's Fiend  Archlord Kristya  and Sky Scourge Invincil  these ones will be your new friends in the ranked matches.  Main strat is to summon one of these on the first turn by using cards like photon sanctuary or star blast and stall. This deck is not meant to be played in the tcg, and i only created this monstruosity to counter almost every deck in the game for free wins. This thing is nasty and i know it, so plz only comment cards that could be useful in the deck.  Time changed, and also the decklist got updated!!! The deck is 50 cards now, but it also has more nasty floodgates!! other good cards that u can add for more ""fun"" are Necrovalley, rivalry of warlords, evenly matched, macro cosmos, summon limit, lose 1 turn and mistake.  <hr />"

Subterror Final Battle won't trigger Subterror Behemoth Umastryx's effect. Its text says ""Activate 1 of these effects, also, after that, Set this card face-down instead of sending it to the GY"". Because the text has ""after that"", another event is taking place after changing 1 face-up ""Subterror"" monster on the field to face-down Defense Position. The conjunctives ""then"" and ""also, after that"" indicate that the part of the effect before it is done strictly before the part of the effect after it, and so effects that could be activated in response to the event before the conjunctive miss the timing. On the other hand, the conjunctives ""<i>and</i>"", ""<i>and if you do</i>"" and ""<i>also</i>"" indicate that both the parts before and after it are done simultaneously. Therefore, no effect is taking place after it. You can use Subterror Guru &amp; Subterror Fiendess to trigger Subterror Behemoth Umastryx's effect.

Imagine using an overpriced token engine with no DARK or more importantly LIGHT targets for a Fusion deck tha","Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Branded list despite already posting a ton of it but because love this deck and I'm fucking sick and tired of people messing it the fuck up despite how hard it is to be bad at building a ""Super Poly the deck"" list and how straightforward of a deck it is to build despite being a Fusion toolbox deck. I hate redundancy, I despise it, but I hate seeing this deck be bastardized by questionable yet objectively terrible decisions even more.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  • It can turbo out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> without Verte or REF. Do I need to say more? • It can make DPE without Verte. Do I need to say even more? • It abuses <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. • It can survive without the Brave Token engine.  Before anything else, I wanna preface this with 1. There's being a good pilot and there's being a good deck builder, and that involves knowledge about what's in number 2, 2. Not because you can do what I'm about to warn you about in number 3, doesn't mean you should, and 3. <strong>DO NOT FUCKING PLAY THIS DECK WITH BRAVE TOKENS</strong>. I do not care if you see someone have a topping list that does otherwise, in theory it works great because ""hurr durr b-but free recurring omni negate opt"", but you know what does the job the same but better in practice? Fucking <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Not to mention that you're doing yourself a disservice by using up 9 slots in your main deck for an engine, where 4 of which are monsters, and none of which are either LIGHT or DARK. I do not give a fuck if your favorite content creator tells you otherwise, I do not care if a list that uses it topped a BO1 event (any deck can so long as either they're lucky enough in the matchmaking, plays a silver bullet strategy, or uses tons of floodgates), I've been testing this deck since Despia and Albaz first came out and all I can guaran-fucking-tee you is <strong>THIS DECK NEEDS MORE LIGHT TARGETS, SO DO NOT KILL IT BY SPLASHING BRAVE TOKENS JUST BECAUSE OF THE FREE NEGATE</strong>. You can go test it out yourself but when you do, all I can say is have fun shooting yourself in the foot. Anyway, the list.  <strong>The Main Deck:</strong>  Monsters  <strong>• The Despians (<a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>, <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>, <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Comedy</a>)</strong> - Can't play the deck without them. Stuff they do: <ol>  	<li>Dramaturge - Main deck boss monster. Can recycle himself when sent to GY or is banished as Fusion material. Has a targeting negation effect when an Extra Deck monster is special summoned (not just from the Extra Deck). You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky.</li>  	<li>Ad Libitum - One of the reasons you can grind and recycle. This can bring back a banished <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> or in your GY upon getting sent to the GY or is banished as Fusion material. Also has an ok ATK boosting effect that can be relevant occasionally. You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky. You can recycle him with your Albaz Fusions anyway.</li>  	<li>Aluber - He's your main Normal Summon in the deck and THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT PLAY THE GODDAMN BRAVE TOKENS IN THIS DECK BECAUSE IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HIM. He also has a targeting negation effect in the GY when a Fusion monster you control is either destroyed by battle or leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. I only play 2 because I already know how the deck plays but you can most certainly play 3 by cutting anything but the 1 ofs, except for <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>.</li>  	<li>Tragedy - Playing 3 of this enables you to play draw cards like Allure of Darkness. I do not understand why people only play 1 of this considering how this is your main searcher. I don't recommend cutting this.</li>  	<li>Comedy - Utility 1 of. Archetypal hand trap to protect your Despia monsters from targeting effects, also allows your Fusion monsters to dodge your opponent's targeting effects while it's in the GY. Feel free to cut this.</li> </ol> <strong>• <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> - Your other relevant Normal Summon in the game. Super Polymerization on legs but can be responded. Regardless, weaker Super Poly is still Super Poly. You can set this against Dragon decks and contact fuse for <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong> - Can special summon herself. Brings out Fallen of Albaz from the Deck. Also a LIGHT target for <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> + <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong> - The main reason why you can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon faster than Verte turbo decks. Also a great <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a> bait.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong> - LIGHT target, which the deck DESPERATELY NEEDS. A Fairy, for the purposes of summoning <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>. And you can always shotgun this against your opponent to cut off their brave token engine. Could be any hand trap, so long as they're LIGHT, DARK, or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a>.  Spells  <strong>• <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong> - Banishing DARK monsters face-up is not a problem, your Fusion monsters can recycle them anyway. Also pair this with <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> for a +1.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - You're almost always dumping Tragedy with either. Gold Sarc is just better because it plays around <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong> - The reason why I prefer playing less copies of Aluber, because I can summon him off of this anyway. Also, if you pitch Tragedy with its effect, or if you play a Branded Shaddolls variant, you can chain block Aluber from getting <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>ed.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> - You literally have no reason to not play this card. All of your Fusion monsters are Super Poly targets.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - Your main search target for Aluber. One of the three reasons why you can summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> in this deck, and also the main reason why it is so worth it to play in this deck, because it can bring him or any Level 8 or higher Fusion monster back from the GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect. Feel free to cut it to 1, but it's always good to have insurance in case it gets banished.  Traps  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a></strong> - Searchable <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> for Despia monsters or Level 8 or higher Fusion monsters, and can also be a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> on resolution in the form of a Trap. I hope you can start to see a pattern now why Super Poly is a MUST HAVE in a deck like this.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a></strong> - Searchable <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> that can also be used to recycle your Branded Spells/Traps by banishing itself. Feel free to bump it up to 3 or cut it down to 1 if you prefer.  <strong>The Extra Deck:</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - Honorary boss monster. Gives all your Fairies effect targeting protection, can also bring any Fairy monster in your GY OPT. A cute interaction you can do is summon him using <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> as Fusion Material and Special Summon it during your opponent's Main Phase and Tribute it for its effect.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a></strong> - Despia boss monster, supposedly. Has a neat effect of either stealing or banishing an opponent's Extra Deck monster in the GY, also burns your opponent equal to the original ATK or DEF of a monster it destroys by battle, whichever was higher. Great Super Poly target.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - This deck has absolutely NO REASON not to play Dragoon in this deck. It's a Towers boss monster that you can bring out without using Verte Anaconda or Red-Eyes Fusion, which are both the problematic parts of summoning him, has the same omni negate the racist tokens provide, except it's also a Level 8 Fusion monster that has FULL SYNERGY WITH YOUR DECK, UNLIKE THEM EXPENSIVE ASS TOKEN ENGINE, can opt pop a monster your opponent controls and burn it, and can be brought back with either <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum </a>or <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Theater</a>. This is the main reason why I am compelled to make this list even when I've already made like five or more iterations of this deck, all of which have Dragoon and I have tested against post-DIFO decks and survived well enough.  <strong>• The Branded Dragons (<a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>, <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion</a>, <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Alba Renatus</a>, <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade</a>, <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion</a>)</strong> - The stars of the show, all Super Poly targets with the following effects: <ol>  	<li>Mirrorjade - Your most forgiving Super Poly target. Can once per every other turn, banish a monster on the field without targeting at a cost of sending a Fusion monster that lists ""Fallen of Albaz"" in its text from your Extra Deck to the GY. Also destroys all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase of the turn it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Lubellion - One of the main reasons this deck can recycle. It Fusion Summons at a cost of a discard by shuffling the materials of that Fusion monster from your GY or banished to the deck. The second reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck.</li>  	<li>Alba Renatus - The <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>/<a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> of the Deck. It can search ANY Polymerization or Fusion Normal Spell from your Deck the turn it was sent to the GY.</li>  	<li>Masquerade - The bane of combo decks. Makes your opponent pay taxes in LP for each time they attempt to activate a card or effect. This effect is not a once per copy, so having two of him stacks, bumping it up from 600 to 1200 LP per card or effect activation.</li>  	<li>Titaniklad - Your main fodder for Mirrorjade, except this time, you won't be searching for a Dogmatika monster, but Special Summoning Fallen of Albaz instead as an interruption.</li>  	<li>Albion - Ideally you'll be summoning him first before Lubellion, but he's the third reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck. It Fusion Summons without a cost by banishing the materials of that Fusion monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. It also sets you a Branded Spell/Trap from your Deck if it is sent to the GY this turn, ideally either <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> for additional interruption or <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> for protection.</li> </ol> <strong>• <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong> - This deck can make Winda, so why the hell not. Also stops Brave Tokens from bringing out the chicken.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - Generic Super Poly targets, one of which has a pretty relevant interruption/floodgate effect.  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  #1. Don't play it with them Brave Tokens. Not because you can, doesn't mean you should. #2. This deck needs LIGHT targets, not overpriced engine that does nothing more for the deck. You'd be much better off running Kaijus instead. Speaking of which, if you want a free omni negate but also want a LIGHT target, just play Invoked in this deck, simple. #3. I also have a 60 card list of Branded Dogmatika Invoked Shaddolls, I do not know who wants to see it or whether I should also post that or not. I'm just saying. #4. If your deck can abuse Super Poly, there's no reason not to do it while it's still at 3. #5. If your deck can abuse BOTH Dragoon and DPE, there's no reason not to do it while they're still both legal.  Overall, not to be a Conspiracy Carl but I'm starting to think that people just love to hate Fusions (and Pendulums), but if all it takes for the prices of Branded cards and Structure Deck to go down is for them to be boycotted and propagandized as being terrible, I'll take it. For now, I'll still categorize this list as a ""non-meta deck"". As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

The best way to do it is to get Wightbaking in the grave first then use it's effect to dump Wightprince which will also send Skull Servant and Lady In Wight to the grave. you can then Banish 2 other ""Skull Servant"" monsters along with Wightprince from your grave to special summon king of the skull servants from your deck.  If you summon Uni-Zombie, Gozuki, or Shiranui Solitare (to go into Uni-Zombie) you can dump a lot of cards in the grave!!! Plus cards like One For One and Hand Destruction maximize your ability to get as many cards into the grave as possible.  For some reason I can't add extra deck cards so ill type it here: 1 Linkuriboh, 1 Knightmare Pheonix, 1 Knightmare Cerberus, 1, Leviair The Sea Dragon, 1 Divine Arsenal AA Zues, 2 Black Rose Dragon, 1 Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon, 1 Coral Dragon, 1 Beelze Of The Diabolic Dragons, 1 Brionac Dragon Of The Ice Barrier, 1 Trushila Dragon Of The Ice Barrier, 1 Relinquished Anima, 1 Abyss Dweller, 1 Caos Ruler The Chaotic Magical Dragon"

This is a fairly consistent FTK that abuses Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth, which I have thought for a long time is strong enough to be banned, so I set out to find a way to break it, and I think this is it. There is just so much about this deck that happens to work out so perfectly, it's honestly kind of crazy. The FTK goes like this:  -Get any 2 level 4 monsters on the field with a Coelacanth in the grave (Leaffish does this, as well as a discard of Coelacanth to summon White Stingray, or Foolish. Summoner Monk does this by itself if you summon Leaffish.)  -Make Dugares and Summon Coelacanth  -Activate Coelacanth summoning specifically Gluttonous Reptolphin Greethys, a Royal Swamp Eel, and any other 2 Level 4s.  -Summon Halq, bring out your Lv 1 Dark Dragon tuner (specifically Dark Dragon, the Rokket one works too), and synchro with Coelacanth to make Beelze in either the leftmost or middle main monster zone (important for Geonator Transverser.)  -Link Halq and one of the 4s to make Geonator Transverser so that it points to Beelze  -Use the Reptolphin and the last Lv 4 to make White Aura Monoceros to bring back Coelacanth  -Activate Coelacanth again (yes, it's a soft once per turn) and summon a Royal Swamp Eel and Beautunaful Princess  -Make Garden Rose Maiden and search Black Garden and Activate it  -Overlay Monoceros and Coelacanth, who are both 7s, to make Red Eyes Flare Metal Dragon, which will trigger Black Garden. Put the Token into the other Geonator Transverser Zone.  -Switch control of Beelze and the Token, then link the token for Link Spider.  -Link away Transverser, Garden Rose Maiden, and Link spider for Agave Dragon, which will burn for 100 because of the Dragon Tuner you used to make Beelze, triggering the Beelze/Flare Metal interaction which will FTK your opponent.  I haven't actually played this deck in any super competitive format, so I don't know how good it actually is. I have Crossout and a few garnets for it since after the FTK tools the deck space is pretty free.

Should work but I need to tweak it a little. Ojamas work really well with ABC but I wanted to keep it purely Union-based, plus I don't like the playstyle of the Ojama version.</span>  <span>Basically just get A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon out and you'll have an insanely strong wincon. Its effect is extremely similar to Herald of Ultimateness, but A2Z doesn't feel nearly as cheesy and has better stats. Herald requires Fairies, A2Z can discard any card. On the other hand, Herald can also negate Summons. A2Z can also banish itself to bring back ABC and XYZ. That's why I run two A2Z, because if you split it up and don't have something like Transmodify, you can't get it back like you can with ABC and XYZ.</span>  <span>Colossus is there because Nemeses Corridor can just generally help in the first place AND allows you to summon TD Colossus. Say you banish A2Z and bring back ABC/XYZ to stop it from being destroyed by battle or something; now you can use Nemeses, bring A2Z back to the Extra Deck, summon Colossus, and use ABC/XYZ to once again summon A2Z.</span>"

Sadly, not many of the cards used then are still applicable in modern Trinity and many were cut during the extended deck tinkering (sadly, Grandsoil was one of those casualties), so the deck is now a soup of engines with lots of micro-synergies. PUNK is perhaps the best out of the bunch, offering a good foundation of advantage and disruption to build on, plus a big finisher with the level 11 Synchro. Psy-Frames are the next big engine - warping the style of gameplay for both players, but sadly at a loss of consistency. Psy-Frames thrive on an empty field, which informed a lot of the S/T choices. Rounding out the deck are support pieces that assist with Earth, Psychic, or the Psy-Frame gameplan. Personal standouts for me include Linkslayer, Sauge de Fleur, Psychic Feel Zone, and the duo of Psy-Framelord Omega and Virtual World Shenshen. They can both put back your banished monsters, which makes the Psy-Frame drawback of banishing your Drivers far less impactful - on top of being great bosses in their own right. Give this a try if you want to have some unorthodox fun, or explore some off the wall cards.

It can go first but it is definitely not optimized to. In terms of how viable it is, I would put it a little lower than the average Blue-Eyes engine in Master Duel. In general, the idea is to try and get one of your big, bad synchro monsters out onto the field, and if that isn't possible than at least get Benki out onto the field. There are some effect negations in the form of Ash Blossom, Soulbang, Soul Beads and Flutist. I made this deck for Master Duel so the idea to have 3 Maxx Cs in the deck is a necessity for almost every deck that wants to go second. Battleball and the Kaiju in this deck have the most interesting interaction since they can be used to easily summon either your big boss Train synchro or your Susanowo, but both cards in general are useful since all of your boss monsters overpower the Kaiju and Battleball can still synchro summon while removing one of the monsters on your opponents side of the field (Note; Battleball's effect is counted as tributing, but you have to target your opponents monster).  In terms of clearing your opponents board, you have Kaijus, the Train (Discard two cards to target and destroy two cards), Ogre (The Red Synchro monster which is basically Harpie's Feather Duster), and Sarutobi (Get rid of one spell or trap + some burn damage). The only one that you'll probably abuse is Ogre, so feel free to run 3 of them if you want.  There's a lot of cool stuff in this deck but honestly, it isn't the greatest. There's a lot this cards can do, but there isn't really any consistent effect negation of any kind and also can be easily negated itself. It also usually can't OTK, and takes 2 turns to kill. If you wanna run a more consistent OTK deck, run Numeron or plenty of other better archetypes. I did get to Diamond with this deck, but that was after a lot of trial and error."

Doesn't like that you have to play 2 Yang Zings in order to fully take advantage of Nine Pillars? Well, in this NEW HalqDon Combo, not only does your Yang Zing float to a Handtrap, but your Arc Light is also CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY BATTLE.  Inspired by the Brave Tenyi from the OCG and B.A.S.E.D. from the TCG, I have created a <em>similar</em> Deck (The TCG/OCG has Swordsoul so its different okay). Through its Full Combo, you will end with the same board as the old Halq Combo, except instead of a random Yang Zing that doesn't really do anything, you will have Chaofeng which can search a Handtrap when destroyed by Nine Pillars or lock your opponent from using effects of a specific Attribute, also your Arc Light is indestructible by battle. And yeah Baronne(ss) is there too... (Why did the TCG remove the ss from Baron?). So anyway, here's the Combo and Deck Breakdown. <h1>Combo</h1> There's only one combo that you need to know really, it's basically Baronne + Halq (Ashuna/Vishuda + Red Rose Dragon) <ol>  	<li>Ashuna/Vishuda Effect to Special themself -&gt; Normal Summon Red Rose Dragon</li>  	<li>Synchro into Baronne -&gt; Red Rose Dragon Special Roxrose Dragon from Deck -&gt; Search Basal Rose Shoot</li>  	<li>Activate Basal Rose Shoot to Special Red Rose Dragon from GY -&gt; Link 2 Rose Dragons into Halqifibrax -&gt; Special Deskbot 001</li>  	<li>Link Halq and 001 into Auroradon -&gt; Special 3 Tokens -&gt; Special Deskbot 001 from GY</li>  	<li>Synchro 2 Tokens and Deskbot 001 into Yazi -&gt; Baronne pop Yazi -&gt; Float into Mare Mare</li>  	<li>Mare Mare Special a Token (1) -&gt; Auroradon Tribute itself and Mare Mare Token to Special O-Lion from Deck</li>  	<li>Synchro Token and O-Lion into Denglong -&gt; Search Nine Pillars</li>  	<li>Mare Mare Special another Token (2) -&gt; Denglong Send Ashuna/Vishuda to become Lvl 7</li>  	<li>Synchro Denglong and Mare Mare Token into Borreload (On the EMZ, otherwise you won't have enough slot) -&gt; Equip Auroradon -&gt; Denglong float into Bi'an</li>  	<li>Mare Mare Special the last Token (3) -&gt; Synchro Mare Mare and Mare Mare Token into Accel Synchron</li>  	<li>Accel Synchron Send Jet Synchron to increase Level -&gt; Synchro Accel Synchron and a Token into Chaofeng</li>  	<li>Jet Synchron Effect to Special itself from GY -&gt; Synchro Jet Synchron and Bi'an into Arc Light</li> </ol> And there you go, 4 Omnis + Handtrap search (Ash, Veiler, or Ghost Ogre) and your opponent can't attack over Arc Light anymore. You know what that means? DROPLET AND DARK RULER CAN'T COUNTER YOU LETS GOOO. Still vulnerable to Kaiju and Super Poly though.  Alternatively, if you already use Baronne to negate on your own turn, you can leave Bi'an on the field. Baronne can bring back Denglong and Bi'an can Quick Synchro with it into Baxia. That's Unicorn for 2.  If you happen to have a certain grudge against DARK Attribute, you can Special Taotie instead of Bi'an, and decrease Accel Synchron's Level instead. With this, you can Synchro into Chaofeng that locks your opponent from using DARK monsters effect. Then, you can Ashuna Effect to Special Mapura from Deck and Synchro into Draco Berserker. Or if you hate Adamancipator with passion, you can give up Arc Light battle protection to lock your opponent from using EARTH monsters effect with Bi'an + Accel Synchron = Chaofeng. For LIGHT monsters, you can use Baxia + Adhara/Jet Synchron (Adhara can be Special by Ashuna if you control a Token). But, not locking your opponent is actually the best choice, since you have to pop Chaofeng with Nine Pillars eventually (Arc Light battle protection is more important).  And yes, I won't give you a different Combo so you can actually learn the Deck for yourself by practicing. The Combo of this Deck varies, depending on your hand and opponent's interaction. <h1>Deck Breakdown</h1> Instead of using a long list like before, I will group cards into paragraphs instead. This way it's easier to explain cards with similar effects/usage. <h2>Main Deck</h2> <p><a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a>; <a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a>; <a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a>; <a data-name=""1x Tenyi Spirit - Mapura"">1x Tenyi Spirit - Mapura</a></p> <p>These Tenyi are your starters as you can Special them for FREE if you control no Effect monsters. <strong>Ashuna</strong> and <strong>Vishuda</strong> are Level 7 which are perfect for <strong>Baronne</strong> as you have plenty of Level 3 Tuners on the Deck. <strong>Adhara</strong> is just a free Tuner to use for <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> and <strong>Mapura</strong> is the worst one. Additionally, these Tenyi monsters have an extra effect if you control a non-Effect monster, which in this Deck, you have a bunch of Tokens and the Extra Deck Tenyi: <strong>Monk of the Tenyi</strong> is also a non-Effect monster. You can banish them from your HAND (and yes people do forget that you can use it from hand) or GY. <strong>Ashuna</strong> Special a Tenyi from Deck but locks you into Wyrm for the rest of the turn. <strong>Vishuda</strong> can bounce a card your opponent controls. <strong>Adhara</strong> can add back a banished Wyrm. And <strong>Mapura</strong> can negate an effect that targets your non-Effect monsters.</p> <p>So, why do I play <strong>Mapura</strong>? Well, it's because it's Level 4 which I need for <strong>Ashuna</strong> Effect. <strong>Shthana</strong> is actually a much better choice as it has a better effect where you can crash your <strong>Monk</strong> to a monster and revive it back while popping a monster your opponent controls (worse <strong>Vishuda</strong> basically). But due to <strong>Mare Mare</strong> being a WATER, I have to play a different Attribute so <strong>Baxia</strong> can shuffle 2 cards instead of 1.</p> <p><a data-name=""3x Red Rose Dragon"">3x Red Rose Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x Roxrose Dragon"">1x Roxrose Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x Basal Rose Shoot"">1x Basal Rose Shoot</a></p> <p>This is the Rose Dragon Package/Engine. When Combined with <strong>Ashuna</strong>/<strong>Vishuda</strong>, you can get a FREE <strong>Halq</strong> after Summoning Baronne. <strong>Red Rose</strong> float into <strong>Roxrose</strong> from hand or Deck when used as Synchro Material and <strong>Roxrose</strong> Search <strong>Basal Rose</strong> when Summoned which can Special a Rose Dragon from hand or GY.</p> <p>I'm playing 3 <strong>Red Rose</strong> because you absolutely want to Normal Summon it every single game. Only 1 <strong>Roxrose</strong> and 1 <strong>Basal Rose</strong> because they are searchable that you will only use once and probably don't want to draw them. They aren't bricks, but you would rather Search them instead and have a different card in your hand.</p> <p><a data-name=""2x Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">2x Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a>; <a data-name=""1x Deskbot 001"">1x Deskbot 001</a>; <a data-name=""1x Mare Mare"">1x Mare Mare</a>; <a data-name=""1x Jet Synchron"">1x Jet Synchron</a></p> <p>These are your most important Combo Pieces that you don't want to draw no matter what. <strong>001</strong> is your <strong>Halq</strong> target, it allows you to climb into <strong>Auroradon</strong> while reviving itself after. <strong>O-Lion</strong> is your Auroradon 2nd Effect target, not only it's a Level 2 Tuner, it also replace itself with a Token when sent to GY. <strong>Mare Mare</strong> is my favorite one, it can ONLY be Special Summoned by a Wyrm monster's Effect, which we have <strong>Yazi</strong> for that. Giving you a free 3 Level 1 Tokens for some insane Synchro Plays while also being a Level 4 Tuner after that. Lastly we have <strong>Jet Synchron</strong>, can be sent from Deck to GY with Accel Synchron, then can revive itself from GY by sending a card from hand to GY (doesn't count as discard btw, so can't do it under something like Arc Light or Dimensional Fissure).</p> <p>I'm playing 2 <strong>O-Lion</strong> because <strong>O-Lion</strong> is THAT important and is pretty much dead most of the time if you draw it. The other 3 are 1 ofs. If you draw <strong>Mare Mare</strong>, that's fine because you can still Combo without <strong>Mare Mare</strong>. Same with <strong>Jet Synchron</strong>. <strong>001</strong> however, is still alive if you draw it since <strong>Halq</strong> can Summon from hand, but you rather draw something else.</p> <p><a data-name=""1x Bi'an, Earth of the Yang Zing"">1x Bi'an, Earth of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing"">1x Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing"">1x Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</a></p> <p>These are your targets for <strong>Denglong</strong> Effect. <strong>Denglong</strong> can Search <strong>Nine Pillars</strong> on Summon and Float into <strong>Bi'an</strong> or <strong>Taotie</strong> when sent to GY. <strong>Bi'an</strong> is a Level 3 and <strong>Taotie</strong> is a Level 5. When they're destroyed, they can float into each other from Deck only. Unfortunately both Special in DEFENSE and both have 0 DEF, but that's alright since we play them solely for their Level. <strong>Bi'an</strong> however, has an extra Effect, giving battle protection when used as Synchro Material while <strong>Taotie</strong> prevents your opponent from stealing the Synchro. You can also Quick Synchro them with <strong>Denglong</strong> during your opponent's turn to go into <strong>Baronne</strong>, <strong>Baxia</strong>, or <strong>Borreload</strong> even. You can change <strong>Taotie</strong> for another copy of <strong>Bi'an</strong> since <strong>Denglong</strong> can only Special from Deck and not hand too. But I like having 2 different Yang Zing so that they can float. Then we have <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>, the Omni-Negate Counter Trap that only live if you control a Yang Zing (The then Effect is mandatory and needed)</p> <p><a data-name=""3x Sangan"">3x Sangan</a>; <a data-name=""1x Crusadia Arboria"">1x Crusadia Arboria</a>; <a data-name=""1x Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">1x Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a></p> <p><strong>Arboria</strong> and <strong>Destrudo</strong> are Extenders while <strong>Sangan</strong> is a starter. You can Normal Summon <strong>Sangan</strong> and Link it into <strong>Almiraj</strong> in order to search <strong>Arboria</strong>, or a Handtrap if you already have <strong>Arboria</strong>. Then you can go <strong>Halq</strong> after. You can also use <strong>Sangan</strong> to chain Block <strong>Halq</strong> if you decided to NOT go for the 1 card Combo and instead Summon another monster (Tuner) and go directly into <strong>Halq</strong>. You can also use <strong>Arboria</strong> and a <strong>Tenyi</strong> to go into <strong>Halq</strong> without committing to your Normal Summon. <strong>Destrudo</strong> serves the same purpose, except you can't use it on Level 7+ monsters which <strong>Ashuna</strong>/<strong>Vishuda</strong> are, or a Link Monster.</p> <p>I'm playing 3 <strong>Sangan</strong> because it's a 1 card <strong>Halq</strong>. If you don't open <strong>Red Rose</strong>, you can try using <strong>E-Tele</strong> instead to make <strong>Baronne</strong> then Normal Summon <strong>Sangan</strong> into Full Combo. Only playing 1 <strong>Arboria</strong> because it's searchable with <strong>Sangan</strong>. And only 1 <strong>Destrudo</strong> because <strong>Destrudo</strong> is just there if you fail your Combo due to opponent's disruptions and doesn't actually save you if <strong>Halq</strong>/<strong>Auroradon</strong> got negated. Also <strong>Destrudo</strong> is a Free <strong>Yazi</strong>.</p> <p><a data-name=""3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>; <a data-name=""3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>; <a data-name=""3x Effect Veiler"">3x Effect Veiler</a>; <a data-name=""3x Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">3x Maxx ""C""</a>; <a data-name=""2x Emergency Teleport"">2x Emergency Teleport</a> (E-Tele)</p> <p>These are your main Handtraps. You probably already knows what <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, and <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong> does so I'm not gonna explain it here. <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> however, is a Handtrap you don't normally see (or see it everyday if you play TCG). It's Effect is not bad, it's just not good enough to be played over <strong>Ash</strong> or <strong>Veiler</strong>. <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> not only serves as a Handtrap, it's also an Extender with <strong>E-Tele</strong> as it's a Level 3 Tuner Psychic. Not only that, you can use <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> not only from your hand, but also field. So, if you don't need to extend with <strong>E-Tele</strong>, you can just Set it and Summon <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> on your opponent's turn and still use it's Effect.</p> <p>If you don't want to play <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong>, that's fine though I recommend you to have it because it will be VERY GOOD in like 6 months or something when Grand Creators come to Master Duel. You can use <strong>Psychic Wheeleder</strong> as an alternative which is only an SR. It's obviously not as good, but you can Special it from hand if you control a Level 3 which Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens are and can pop monsters when used as Synchro Material.</p> <p><a data-name=""3x Crossout Designator"">3x Crossout Designator</a>; <a data-name=""2x Called by the Grave"">2x Called by the Grave</a>; <a data-name=""1x Nibiru, the Primal Being"">1x Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>; <a data-name=""1x D.D. Crow"">1x D.D. Crow</a>; <a data-name=""1x Infinite Impermanence"">1x Infinite Impermanence</a></p> <p><strong>Crossout</strong> and <strong>Called by</strong> are your Anti-Handtraps while <strong>Nibiru</strong>, <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>, and <strong>Imperm</strong> are just <strong>Crossout </strong>target while also being a good Handtrap to have. You absolutely HAVE TO STOP your opponent from negating your <strong>Halq</strong>, or else you pass with like nothing. That's why I have 3 <strong>Crossout</strong> here. I'm not playing <strong>Droll</strong> and <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> because <strong>Droll</strong> doesn't really stop you from doing your Combo and I haven't really see anyone playing <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> yet. <strong>Nibiru</strong> and <strong>Imperm</strong> are quite common to see in ladder, while <strong>D.D. Crow</strong> is played by Tri-Brigade. <strong>Crossout</strong> is also better than <strong>Called by</strong> when negating a Handtrap that you already have in your hand as <strong>Called by</strong> negate the monster it banish until the end of NEXT TURN (Pls don't forget that). Additionally, you can also <strong>Crossout</strong> <strong>E-Tele</strong> against Virtual World and <strong>Crossout</strong> a Tenyi for a Mirror match or Swordsoul when BoDE come to Master Duel in 2 months.</p>  <h2>Extra Deck</h2> <p><a data-name=""1x Baronne de Fleur"">1x Baronne de Fleur</a>; <a data-name=""1x Borreload Savage Dragon"">1x Borreload Savage Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x F.A. Dawn Dragster"">1x F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>; <a data-name=""1x Herald of the Arc Light"">1x Herald of the Arc Light</a></p> <p>These are your negates. All of them except <strong>Dragster</strong> can negate anything. <strong>Baronne</strong> has an extra Effect to pop a card once per turn, and an Effect on Standby Phase that does come up. If <strong>Baronne</strong> is already out of negate, you can return it to EX in order to revive a Level 9 or lower monster from GY (could be <strong>Arc Light</strong>, <strong>Denglong</strong>, <strong>Chaofeng</strong>, or anything). <strong>Borreload</strong> is just a big boi with 4050 ATK, and its negate doesn't destroy, so try using it to negate GY Effect or non-continuous Spell/Trap instead of monsters on hand or field. <strong>Dragster</strong> is an insteresting one, it only negate Spell/Trap and become Level 5 after the negate. You can easily go into <strong>Dragster</strong> with <strong>Destrudo</strong>. And lastly, <strong>Arc Light</strong>, the most hated one. Banishes any monster sent from hand or Main Deck to GY. This will make Tri-Brigade players instantly surrenders and prevent your opponent from using Droplet (they can only send monsters from field which is a huge minus, and if they send no monsters, you can just negate the Droplet). The biggest problem though, is that <strong>Arc Light</strong> only has 600 ATK and 1000 DEF, can easily get attacked over. However, if Summoned using <strong>Bi'an</strong>, it completely cover up it's one and only flaws. However, <strong>Arc Light</strong> also disables your <strong>Veiler</strong>, <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong>, and <strong>Maxx ""C"" </strong>but not <strong>Ash</strong> and <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.</p> <p><a data-name=""1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing"">1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Baxia, Brightess of the Yang Zing"">1x Baxia, Brightess of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>; <a data-name=""1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a></p> <p><strong>Chaofeng</strong> is a good card when paired with <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>, it allows you to search ANY Tuner from Deck with no restrictions when destroyed (yes it's a ""when"" Effect so it can mistiming). This means you can search <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, or <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> after negating with <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>. However, <strong>Chaofeng</strong> can mistiming, meaning that you HAVE TO use <strong>Nine Pillars</strong> as cl2 no matter what because popping your <strong>Chaofeng</strong> has to be last action that happens within that chain (If cl1 is negated, then cl2 is the last action). Not only that, the ""then"" Effect only happens if the card is shuffled into the Deck. So if you negate a card that sends itself to GY or banish itself as cost (like <strong>Fraktall</strong> or <strong>Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</strong>), then you don't get to shuffle it, therefore you don't destroy your Yang Zing. <strong>Chaofeng</strong> also locks your opponent using the same Attribute as a Yang Zing monster used as material. <strong>Chaofeng</strong> also has a 3rd Effect (read it yourself).</p> <p>Next, we have <strong>Baxia</strong>. Not part of your main Combo but good to have nonetheless. Shuffles cards on field on Summon up to the number of Wyrm monsters used as material with different Attributes. Your tenyi has different Attributes, your Yang Zing too, and Mare Mare is WATER (which is why I play Mapura over Shthana). <strong>Baxia</strong> can also revive a Level 4 or lower by popping a card you control (can revive <strong>Arc Light</strong>). Then there's <strong>Yazi</strong>, whose cannot be targeted by opponent's card. Can pop itself and your opponent's card while also floats into ANY Wyrm from Deck. <strong>Yazi</strong> is much better going 2nd, because you don't have to use <strong>Baronne</strong> or <strong>Auroradon</strong> to pop it and trigger its floating Effect. You can simply use its own Effect</p> <p>Lastly, we have <strong>Draco Berserker</strong>, an underatted generic Level 8 Synchro. <strong>Draco Berserker</strong> can attack twice on monsters and gain a bunch of ATK permanently. It can also banish a monster in response to their Effects (good for something like <strong>Raye</strong> or Normal Summons). Also it's a Wyrm, so you can Synchro into it after <strong>Ashuna</strong> Effect.</p> <p><a data-name=""1x Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">1x Denglong, First of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Accel Synchron"">1x Accel Synchron</a>; <a data-name=""1x Shooting Riser Dragon"">1x Shooting Riser Dragon</a></p> <p>These are your Synchro Tuners, which you need because you're Summoning a bunch of non-Tuner Tokens with <strong>Auroradon</strong> and <strong>Mare Mare</strong>. <strong>Denglong</strong> is the Best one, it's a literal +3. Search a Yang Zing card on Summon, send a Wyrm from Deck to GY to change Level, and Floats into a Yang Zing when leaving the field. Also <strong>Denglong</strong> is Level 5 so Token + <strong>O-Lion</strong> can make it. <strong>Accel Synchron</strong> can Send <strong>Jet Synchron</strong> from Deck to GY to increase or decrease its Level, also it can Quick Synchro on opponent's turn. <strong>Shooting Riser</strong> can Send any Level 6 or lower monster from Deck to GY on Summon to change Level and it can Quick Synchro on opponent's turn. You don't really Synchro into it at all, it's Simply there for <strong>Halq</strong> 2nd Effect target. Alternatively, you can play <strong>Desert Locust</strong> or <strong>Formula Synchron</strong>, but <strong>Shooting Riser</strong> is more Versatile.</p> <p><a data-name=""1x Crystron Halqifibrax"">1x Crystron Halqifibrax</a>; <a data-name=""1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a></p> <p>Ah yes, who doesn't know about these duo? The Combo that's literally splashable in any Synchro Deck and takes no effort to go into. <strong>Halq</strong> on Summon can Summon a Level 3 or lower Tuner from Deck and can banish itself on opponent's turn to Special a Synchro Tuner from EX (yes this is treated as a Synchro Summon). <strong>Auroradon</strong> on Summon can Summon 3 Level 3 Tokens. Can Tribute up to 3 cards to respectively: Pop a card, Special a Mecha Phantom Beast from Deck, and add a Trap from GY.</p> <p><a data-name=""1x Monk of the Tenyi"">1x Monk of the Tenyi</a>; <a data-name=""1x Salamangreat Almiraj"">1x Salamangreat Almiraj</a></p> <p>You need <strong>Monk</strong> in order to Special <strong>Arboria</strong> from hand (if you draw it) and go into <strong>Halq</strong>. <strong>Monk</strong> also allows you to go into <strong>Halq</strong> with 2 Tenyi (including <strong>Adhara</strong>) without committing into your Normal Summon. And <strong>Monk</strong> Also enables <strong>Vishuda</strong> 2nd Effect. <strong>Almiraj</strong> on the other hand is used for 1 card <strong>Halq</strong> with <strong>Sangan</strong>.</p>  <h1>Conclusions</h1> The Biggest weakness of the Deck, is that it relies TOO MUCH on Halq and Auroradon, if they're negated, you're absolutely screwed. Which is why I play 2 Called by and 3 Crossout. Unless you go 2nd where you can somewhat Turbo into Yazi into Mare Mare and goes from there. It also lacks follow-up because once again, it relies on Halq and Auroradon. However, it's extremely extremely consistent, 2 monsters is all you need to do some Combos. If you go 2nd, you don't even need Baronne for Full Combo because Yazi can trigger its own Effect by his other Effect. Other than that, Deck can go into Halq without Normal Summon because of how many Extenders it has.  This Deck can still play under Maxx ""C"" simply by passing with 1-2 monsters and relies on your 15 Handtraps (yes that's the exact number of Handtraps I play). That's also the reason why I don't play Equalizer (Board Breakers) like Droplet or Lightning Storm, because if I just prevent my opponent from playing on their first turn, I don't need to negate anything on my turn (still loses to Control Decks lmao). I'm not too worried about Skill Drain because Vishuda can handle that.  Overall, I enjoy the Deck a lot. Seeing how Baronne is in the game and I can do Yazi Mare Mare Combo on turn 1 really excites me to make this Combo Deck. The Deck doesn't really have to be expensive, you can swap the staples with other staples that you have or even more Extenders, or just cut the Deck for consistency. I don't recommend crafting 3 Crossout because it may get Semi-Limited, or even Limited in the future (it's Limited on the OCG right now).  The next Combo Deck that I will post won't involve HalqDon Combo at all, I promise. I will post it after the Synchro Festival is over"

If this is not possible, A Borreload or Borrelsword with Fire Prison is a good alternative."

What could go wrong? Oh! And Mayakashis cause why not?,"Generally, the main goal is to set up a Zombie World - Rivalry lockdown to set up into Mayakashis for additional power and negate. Eldlich allows for the deck to accelerate thanks to its ability to summon any Zombie monster from the eldlixer cards. I do wish the OCG cards for Mayakashi were here to help with banish recovery, but that's what the Shiranuis are for. If you wish to side out or completely remove Rivalry, I'd full edit the deck to remove the Shiranuis for PSY Framelord Omega and probably tank set up instead of the King Ha Des cheat. Up to you. Oh and if you're looking for a place for Ash, book of life and Gozuki can be replaced in a heartbeat."

It’s kinda consistent (but can still brick hard) and very good at beating down opponents who overlook effects, which they usually do (people never notice that master Cerberus can’t be destroyed when 4 or more spell counters are on the field)  Once you get the right setup you can start doing some pretty insane combos, I still make misplays like crazy even though I’ve improved sense I started using the deck.  The first objective is getting electrumite out and astrograph into your extra, the setups astrograph  allows in this particular deck can help take you from there, looping astrograph lets you get the maximum amount of spell counters to work with.  Sadly, people always seem to leave mid combo."

Super fun and relatively cheap (low UR CP without Side Deck). The more consiste","<span>  <strong>   If you want to make this deck I highly recommend opening the ""Savage Crimson Dragon"" secret pack as most of the URs and SRs come from that one pack. It is relatively cheap to make if you exclude the Side Deck.   </strong>  </span>  &nbsp;  <span>     Literally just switch BLS out for any of the Synchros already in the extra deck or from the side deck if you want to use it in the Synchro Festival. Otherwise BLS can be very situationally useful as it cannot be targeted by card effects (Red Supernova and Red Nova can't be destroyed by card effects but CAN be targeted and thus negated, banished, or returned to hand/deck).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>     The <strong>Main</strong> and <strong>Extra Deck</strong> is what I am <strong>currently running/what got me to Plat</strong>. The Side Deck is full of staples I think would be beneficial to add <strong>if you already have them, </strong>they are not necessary for the deck to work properly! <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> plus <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> are probably the most helpful as the go-to combo often has 5 or more summons. <a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">Called by the Grave is also pretty helpful for countering </a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom </a><a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">or </a><a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">Maxx ""C.""</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  "">  </a><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  ""> can also be useful in some situations but keep in mind it can't be used to make </a><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  "">.</a></span>  &nbsp; <p><span><strong><span>Strategy</span></strong></span></p> <span><strong>ALWAYS USE CRIMSON RESONATOR'S EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING ELSE!!</strong></span>  <span>      Always go first if able. Ideal end board is solo <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a> (made with Chaos Ruler) with 1 or more <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>s/Trap Trick and Solemn Judgement set. This way you have 2 potential board nukes or 1 nuke and an invincible 6000 ATK Monster, plus you don't banish your own monsters and you can bring back Chaos Ruler next turn. THE KEY IS TO WAIT until your opponent is almost finished with their combo OR attempts to banish, negate, or return to hand Supernova Dragon before using Red Reign in order to maximize its effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>     <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a> is the backbone of this deck and allows it to fairly easily beat Tri Brigade, Sky Striker, Virtual World, etc so long as you go first due to its non-targeting banish and its ability to make Red Supernova Dragon unaffected by card effects (very few decks can hit above 6,000+ ATK and even if they can you can nuke their field with Red Supernova's on attack declaration quick effect). Use it every turn because odds are you will be able to return it to hand. For this reason I want to add Trap Trick to this deck for the frustrating occasions when it isn't in the top 10 cards of the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>     If you successfully did full first-turn combo (Red Supernova Dragon on the field with Chaos Ruler, 1 Light, and 1 Dark in GY) don't be afraid to use Supernova's effect that banishes it for cost, because you have a guaranteed Chaos Ruler plus whatever combos you still have in hand for the next turn while your opponent has likely used most of their cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>     Nibiru and Ash Blossom are problems, but usually your Nibiru will be more powerful than your opponent's and if you managed to get Chaos Ruler and 1 Light in the GY you can bring him back and continue comboing or go into BLS. Also, usually you can combo through and bait out Ash because of how many search and special summon from hand effects are in this deck. The MAXX ""C"" challenge has gone 50/50 in my experience.</span>  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>Boss Monsters</strong></span></p> <span><a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a></span>  <span>     Legit one of the best trap cards in the whole game when used in this deck. It non-targeting banishes all monsters except those with the highest level, so if you have Lv. 12 Red Supernova Dragon out on the field it's a full nuke. This is the main reason why you want to go first. BUT ITS BEST EFFECT IS THAT IT CAN RECYCLE INFINITELY by adding it to hand from GY when you synchro summon. All Extra Deck monsters but 1 are Dark Dragon Synchro monsters, so this just happens automatically in your combos. <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> synergizes with this card perfectly, as it gives you 5 extra chances at ""drawing"" <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>. Also, Chaos Ruler's GY effect means you can pretty much always synchro summon again on your Second Turn.</span>  <span>     Furthermore, it makes your <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a> into a nearly impenetrable wall of ATK by making it unaffected by your opponent's card effects for 1 turn. If you use this card at the right time, it can easily guarantee a win. Lets also not miss the fact that this card's board nuke effect IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE USE PER TURN. So if you have 1 Red Reign in hand and 1 gets sent to the GY by Chaos Ruler during the combo, you have 2 board nukes and the ability to chain the invincibility effect if your opponent can react to the first. For this reason I want to add Trap Trick to further increase consistency. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a></span>  <span>     Go-to boss monster. On average 6,000 ATK when summoned on first turn. Can't be destroyed by card effects, but CAN BE TARGETED &gt; use Red Reign to make up for this weakness. On monster effect or attack declaration it can BANISH ALL CARDS YOUR OPPONENT CONTROLS, yes that means spells and traps too! (it also comes back to your field at the end of your nest End Phase). Wish it had an animation though.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a></span>  <span>     Worse version of Red Supernova Dragon, but still an absolute beatstick. No board nuke quick effect, but still unable to be destroyed by card effect (can still be targeted though). MAIN THING TO REMEMBER is that to make Red Nova you HAVE TO USE Red Dragon Archfiend or Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a></span>  <span>     Low-Key has the most OP effect in the entire game &gt; STOPS YOUR OPPONENT FROM ACTIVATING ALL CARD EFEFCTS FOR ONE TURN! This absolutely destroys Dragonmaids and other decks with lots of Battle Phase or On Attack effects, as well as trap heavy decks that get too greedy and wait for your boss monster to come out (your opponent cannot react to this effect with card effects).</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>  <span>     Newest addition to the deck, still in testing phase. Adds another nuke and negate to the deck. Nuff said</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a></span>  <span>     Usually only used on your second turn or later. Can sacrifice another monster on the field to bring back another ""Red Dragon Archfiend."" Often you will use one of the free, special summon from hand or GY monsters to do this (Synkron, Creation, Wandering King, Chaos Ruler). This also works well with its ability to summon 2 tuners (1 from deck and 1 from GY) after doing damage.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a></span>  <span>     Go-to negate for the deck, works on all card effects used ON THE FIELD (can't negate GY or hand effects). Works pretty well as a replacement for Red Supernova Dragon if you brick and can't summon it SO LONG AS YOU HAVE RED REIGN. Summons a tuner from your GY after if does damage &gt; this often means you can get some extra combos in Main Phase 2. Synchro summoning this monster is an easy way to get <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a> back on your Second Turn as there are 7 Lv. 1 tuners in the deck and if you got the proper First Turn combo you should be able to get <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler</a> back from the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a></span>  <span>     Main Lv. 8 Synchro Dark Dragon you will be using for combo purposes. Its ability to come back from the GY by banishing 1 Dark and 1 Light monster from the GY makes it great synchro fodder and bait for negates. Its on-summon excavate ability is doubly useful as it can provide extra combos and get a Red Reign in the GY (which will be returned to hand when you use Chaos Ruler to synchro another Dark Dragon). The real MVP of the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>  <span>     Just a better version of Red Dragon Archfiend. Go-to when making Red Nova Dragon. Its effect to destroy all special summoned monsters with less or equal ATK can be very useful, and you can always use it as synchro fodder after activating this effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a></span>  <span>    Good defensive wall if you happen to brick and can only get out a Lv. 8. It can also become a pretty strong beatstick in certain situations and punishes opponents for using burn strategies that don't OTK.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>  <span>     Classic, but kinda trash. Its ability to destroy all Defense Position monsters can be situationally useful, but its secondary effect can backfire significantly and precludes any Main Phase 2 combos. Still useful for making Red Nova Dragon though. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a></span>  <span>     Basically an anti-brick measure by making Wandering King more useful in-hand. Can make Red Supernova Dragon if you also have Crimson Resonator (just pick 2 Lv.2's instead of 2 Lv.1's). Can also use it to get a massive Life Point boost by bringing back Red Resonator and targeting your 6,000+ ATK Red Supernova Dragon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a></span>  <span>     Situationally very useful due to the fact it cant be targeted by card effects (this covers the weakness of Red Supernova and Red Nova). You won't always be able to summon it though because some of the combo cards limit you to Synchro or Dark Dragon monsters only for 1 turn.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <p><span><strong><span><span>Combo Cards</span></span></strong></span></p> <span><a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a></span>  <span>     Great for making <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> or as fodder for <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a>'s effect. Second effect is great for letting you set up Second Turn combos based on what you have in-hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Chain Resonator"">Chain Resonator</a></span>  <span>     EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CARD! The 2 copies of this card are the ONLY 2 Light monsters in this deck, which you need for <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>'s effect. THEREFORE, YOU NEED AS MANY COPIES OF THIS CARD AS YOU HAVE OF CHAOS RULER! Its normal summon effect can be very helpful for many Second Turn combos, and being Lv. 1 it can make <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a></span>  <span>     1-Card combo. Usually select <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> the first time you use its summon effect (just read combos) but once the combo is set up, select <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a> because it basically guarantees you can special summon <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> next turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a></span>  <span>     Great backup combo starter. Even better backup secondary effect (on special summon it lets you gain Life Points based on the ATK of a monster on the field, yes even your 6,000+ ATK <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a>) for emergency situations. Often a good idea to use its normal summon effect with <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, because you can make a Lv. 10 that way.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a></span>  <span>     ALWAYS USE THIS CARD'S IN HAND EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING! It is often a good idea to try to bait out <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> by using <a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a> even if you already have Crimson in hand, because if they ash Crimson's second effect rather than Chaos Ruler's effect then you can't make Red Supernova Dragon. It can be a good idea to return it to hand with <a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a>'s effect just in case your board gets cleared because you can then use its full effect on your Second Turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Wandering King Wildwind"">Wandering King Wildwind</a></span>  <span>     Its GY effect makes great bait for <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>s or other negates if you already have a combo in hand. Otherwise, it can help you get the card you need. For this reason I often don't select it with Chaos Ruler's effect unless I specifically need it for a combo because then it ends up in the GY. Like all special summon from-hand cards in this deck, makes great fodder for <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a>'s effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Ascator, Dawnwalker</span>  <span>     The backup Lv. 8 synchro option because of its discard cost. It really hurts when this card gets Ash Blossomed so I usually try to use another card first. IF EVER POSSIBLE, DISCARD <a data-name=""RED REIGN"">RED REIGN</a>! You will bring it back to your hand immediately after you use Ascator to synchro summon. A second-best option is <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a> because it is useless in hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a></span>  <span>     Great bait for negates, people seem to have a deep fear of searchers. Usually used to get <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> in hand. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></span>  <span>     Another great bait option if you have more combos in hand. Great because it saves you normal summoning <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> or <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <p><span><strong><span>Combos</span></strong></span></p> <span><strong><span>Main 1st turn combo (if you start with Crimson Resonator or Resonator Call): </span></strong></span>  <span>(You can always risk it if you have Ascator, Dawnwalker and hope that Chaos Ruler excavates Crimson Resonator --&gt;

I put some chaos cards 'cause sinergices with The Fables, Ojama, and Cyber Dragons being Light monster and Dangers, Dark Worlds, and Chaos monsters being Dark Monsters. Ojama can be useful 'cause of it's effect of when being sent to the grave while being in the field or hand to both players drawing 1 card and discarding one card.  I put in Paleos for two reasons one Dinomischus it's a great card and 'cause of the Discard effect and two They can be used as Link/Tribute fodder. So something you should take into account when playing this deck it's Dark World's rulings. So just to summarize Dark World only activate their effect when they are discarded BY AN EFFECT, if it's discarded by COST they would not trigger. Don't worry Fables and Dangers trigger even as Discard cost.  Ok so just to help anyone using Dark Worlds. I'll clarify which ones are cost and which ones are effect. COST (Dark worlds WON'T trigger): Lighting Vortex and Phoenix Wind Wing Blast. They're more cards that count as Cost, but these are the ones in this decks. EFFECT (Dark worlds will trigger): Dangers, Bone Temple Block, Danger! Zone, Fabled Treason, Fabled Raven, and Paleozoic Dinomischus.  If you wish you could use this Decklist as a basis for your future decks.  &nbsp;"

But personally, the usage of Herald of Ultimateness in some <span class=""ignored"">Drytron</span> decks never suited my tastes with them. And, as a very non-meta casual player, I wanted to create a less powerful deck built around them. This deck uses Herald of Perfection rather than Herald of Ultimateness for consistency; as it is easier to bring out Herald of Perfection.</span> <h3><span>Description and Strategies</span></h3> <span>The main gimmick is using Herald of Perfection to negate plays by your opponent by sending Fairies from your hand to the Graveyard. And as such, this deck's monsters are almost exclusively Fairies. Eva, being a notable example, allows you to add 2 more Fairies to your hand when sent to the Graveyard. While the Heralds are good at shutting your opponent down, they have a considerable lack of offensive ability. Which is where Saffira, Queen of Dragons, Honest, and Hip Hoshiningen come in.</span>  <span>Saffira is a great help for more than offensive ability as she gets to add cards to your hand at the end of turns where <span class=""ignored"">a</span> <span class=""ignored"">LIGHT</span> monster was sent from your hand to the Graveyard. Which should be happening frequently due to the Herald's negation cost. Saffira's effect can benefit in many different ways within the deck. She can be used to recycle Eva and Honest. She can allow you to draw more cards to get what you want. Or you can cripple your opponent by discarding a card from their hand. Additionally, her ritual spell ""Hymn of Light"" works as R<span class=""ignored"">itual</span> Monster destruction protection. As if it is in the Graveyard, you can banish it instead of letting a ritual monster be destroyed. This is great if your opponent is able to beat over Herald of Perfection without activating effects which you can negate. Hymn of Light can also be discarded by Saffira's draw 2 effect, or can be set on the field in hopes your opponent destroys it. As long as it's in the Graveyard, it works.</span>  Don't underestimate the Non-Ritual Heralds either. They can be great hand-traps if you don't have Herald of Perfection on the field yet. This deck runs 3 copies of Herald of Orange Light, 2 of Green Light, and 1 of Purple Light. They can be used as fodder for Herald of Perfection. Or, they can negate your opponents effects according to their corresponding card types (Orange = Monster, Green = Spell, Purple = Trap). Orange Light is especially helpful as monster effects are typically the most important to shut down. And it also protects you from your opponent's hand traps, like Ash Blossom. Do note that using these three as hand traps has a heavy discard cost. So be careful with what you choose to negate.  &nbsp;  Some Knightmares are in the Extra Deck to compensate for the deck's lack of removal. Just in case you end up facing a field you cant deal with. And Salamangreat Almiraj to be able to send Eva to the Graveyard after normal summoning it (slight brick protection). <h4><span>Weaknesses</span></h4> <span>Of course, this deck is not without its weaknesses. Early on, it's easy to be denied access to Herald of Perfection. Additionally, Herald of Perfection has <span class=""ignored"">low</span> <span class=""ignored"">ATK</span>, so putting it in Attack Position is risky. Also noteworthy, Herald of Perfection cannot negate Counter-Traps. A well-timed Counter-Trap can easily get rid of Herald of Perfection. Continuous Traps/Spells also can't be negated after they are first activated. Effects that don't warrant an actual activation (cards that special summon themselves, for instance) also can't be negated. </span><span>And finally, Herald of Perfection's negation cost is a discard. So you will typically be low on card advantage. Meaning, if your board is broken, it may be hard to build it up again.</span> <h4><span>Side Deck</span></h4> <ul>  	<li><span>Herald of Ultimateness and it's Ritual Spell is in the Side Deck in case it's wanted to be played.</span></li>  	<li><span>A Timelord is in the Side Deck so Diviner of Herald can gain its level to summon Ultimateness. This can be replaced with any Level 10 Fairy-type Extra Deck Monster.</span></li>  	<li><span>3 of the Non-Ritual Main Deck Heralds are in the Side Deck so <span class=""ignored"">TCG</span> format can be played by replacing Eva with them.</span></li>  	<li><span>Some draw power through Pot of Extravagance is in there as well. As it may be needed if you need more cards in your hand.</span></li> </ul> It should be noted, the Side Deck for this deck isn't a proper Side Deck. It adds more options but not much else.

Cheaper alternative. There arent a lot of expensive cards except Aluber and Chimere. Half of the deck is from (3) Structure,"Start with Branded Fusion to summon Albion Branded Following Mirrorjade. You get it with Springans Kitt or Aluber. Get Aluber with Branded Opening or Tragedy. Send Tragedy to gy by Burial Sakrophag, Allure or a fusion.  With Branded Lost get Springans Kitt or Mercourier if you need.  If you activate Mirrorjade send Sprind to gy to get a antother Springans for turn 2 or Brigrand to get Mercourier.  With Mirrorjade on field next to summon is Lubellion (Albaz and Dramaturg with Branded Fusion) following Dragostapelia for some negation and dont forget Dramaturg.  &nbsp;  For example a good field looks like Branded Lost and Theater, Mirrorjade Dragostapelia Quaeritis.  Without Chimere you dont need Poly, Mudragon and antoher Albaz should be fine.  As you can see handtraps and Sidedeck are a cheaper version. I want to try out some locales with this deck, if you have some suggestions please leave a comment."

No Special Summoning. Normal Summon forever.,"So i finally return with a more updated build of my previous Floowandereeze Dogmatika build.  A fair bit has changed since the previous format, but i will included a brief outline of the decks key themes as well as my changes.  The ratio of 2 Empen, 1 Raiza and 1 Apex I believe is still correct. 2 Empen is great when you need to stop decks reliant on their link monster effects to be able to play (Prank Kids, PK, Tri-Brigade and Striker), and always being able to search a second is always handy in case they are able to get through both statue and the first copy for special summon decks in general. 1 Raiza is enough with careful management to loop itself and your opponents cards back, especially if you have Unexplored Winds up. 1 Apex is a looping negate which makes the deck really strong.  The Dogmatika package has lost 1 copy of Nadir to the banlist, and 1 of the 2 copies of Punishment in my previous build, mainly as the Floowandereeze engine has much more consistency now and i require a backup plan less of the time.  The main deck does not feature Shifter or and handtraps because the deck has plently of board breaker/force negate options thanks to Nadir, Book Of Moon, Raigeki, Harpie's Feather Duster and dare i say it Mystic Mine. Shifter conflicts with the Dogmatika engine as well as being useless in an ever increasing number of mirror matches. Book Of Moon acts to prevent veiler/imperm negating vital Floowandereeze plays as well as trading off negates going second. Nadir is useful for baiting Ash as well as proving an option for Empen to normal summon Ecclessia in case you cannot get Barrier Statue out (or game 2/3 versus the mirror). Raigeki, Harpies and Mine also force negation or break boards. Being able to get rid of Mine naturally makes it great to stall until you have the resources you need.  A lone copy of Judgement in the main deck is there to prevent Droplets/DRNM/Raigeki/Lightning Storm from stopping Empen/Statute  Nothing has changed in the ED. Everything is very Dogmatika related bar Assembled Nightingale + Zeus package. Verdant is there on rare occasions to summon Baronne and posdibly opposing Apex/Raiza.  Side deck choices are simple. Dark Simorgh for Eldlich and other backrow heavy decks. D-Shifter VS everything except the mirror. Night Beam is my interesting tech choice. Being able to pick of set Dreaming Town in the mirror can really be useful, but can used against Sanguine in Eldlich  as well. Twin Twisters would result in discarding cards which isn't always the best option and Cyclone allows the likes of Dreaming Town to be recovered more easily with Toucan, being sent to grave means it has to banish itself via it's second effect or be banished by Stri. Also cards like Sanguine can simply be activated in response to it.  An additonal copy of Raigeki and Mystic Mine for combo/monster heavy decks, Triple Evenly for the mirror and any deck after you bait negations, 2 more Solemn for going 1st after siding and Macro Cosmos for a permanent D-Shifter."

Despia is what is exactly from a stand point of anything being hell on earth; but the fact is deck I am using today won't be using <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>or be running a fully functional Adventurer engine. This is in part due to the upcoming banlist making them the two hot spots for either bannings or limitations. So as with any Despia deck: you go with 3 Aluber, 2 Tragedy, 1 Ad Libitum, and 1 Comedy; but with the release of <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, you can continue going with 2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> without concerns of Polymerization or that one Despia field spell that did things. Also besides <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, another change I made to Branded - Despia is the addition of <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> (a card that seen play for quite a while now) and the new card <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> (A card that Special Summons a ""Despia"" or Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster, then goes into a fusion summon by banishing from either field). The extra deck also hasn't had any real significant changes from any other Despia - Albaz deck besides the newly released monsters from the Albaz Strike Structure Deck and with three link monsters, with whom (besides <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot; Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom&quot;&gt;Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom&lt;/a&gt;y"">y</a> because he makes use of your opponents Dark monsters from the GY) have no significance besides fusion fodder and I'm ok with that.  &nbsp;"

A weak archetype focused on putting your opponent in face-up defense position and gaining advantage off of i,"&nbsp; <h3>Description and Strategies</h3> The main gimmick of Spiders, is putting your opponent's monsters into face-up Defense Position, and gaining advantage off of that. The deck doesn't synergise perfectly with itself, so strategies must be used to cater to each card individually: <ul>  	<li>Mother Spider works as long as your opponent has 2 face-up Defense Position monsters. As she simply tributes them to Special Summon herself. Cards like Earthquake and Spider's Web greatly improve this. As they can force your opponent into Defense Position on a larger scale. It's best to use this to tribute stronger monsters your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Spyder Spider works rather simply. If it destroys a Defense Position monster (face-up or face-down) you get to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Insect from your Graveyard. This can be used to Special Summon most cards in this deck.</li>  	<li>Informer Spider must be destroyed by a card effect to activate it's effect. Which is to take control over a defense position monster your opponent controls. The easiest way to do this is to use Shield Crush on your own set Informer Spider.</li>  	<li>Ground Spider has a soft Once Per Turn effect to set an opponent's summoned monster to Defense Position. However, this is only available if Ground Spider itself is in Defense Position. Earthquake can help with this. Additionally, attacking with Ground Spider into anything that wont destroy it while Spider's Web is active will also put Ground Spider into Defense Position without requiring you to wait a turn with it in Attack Position. Spyder Spider and Dragonbite are also capable of Special Summoning Ground Spider in face-up Defense Position.</li>  	<li>Relinquished Spider can be utilized well in the later game. Use any established method to get your opponent's monsters in face-up Defense Position. Then you can summon Relinquished Spider (normal or special). It's effect allows you to tribute it as a cost, in order to destroy all face-up Defense Position monsters your opponent controls.</li> </ul> Dark Spider, even though it is technically a part of the archetype, does nothing to support it. And can't be used effectively. So it wasn't included. Underground Arachnid, is technically a part of the archetype as well. But it's barely used because it's hard to bring out in a Spider deck. Dragonbite is a Level 4 Dark Tuner, so summoning it with Relinquished Spider will allow you to summon it.  Some other noteworthy cards in the deck, that haven't been mentioned yet are: <ul>  	<li>Verdant Sanctuary, which allows you to add another Insect of the same level to your hand when an Insect is destroyed. This is helpful since most of the deck is consistently leveled.</li>  	<li>Retaliating ""C"" and Resonance Insect, which both work as searchers for the other cards. Retaliating ""C"" searches every Insect in the deck (except Mother Spider). And Resonance Insect searches Mother Spider.</li>  	<li>Spider's Lair, which isn't too helpful if Spider's Web is already active, but can work as a good alternative.</li>  	<li>Enemy Controller, which both allows you to put a monster in face-up Defense Position, and allows you to tribute one of your monsters, to take control of an opponents. Which you can then tribute if you are capable. Note that you can actually use Enemy Controller more than once per turn. So you can Tribute a monster to take control of an opponents monster. Then Tribute that monster to take control of another monster. Which you can then tribute for Mother Spider or a Link Summon.</li>  	<li>Butterflyoke, which in a way, locks your opponent's monster in whatever position you want them in. Though, it does require that monster to attack first.</li>  	<li>Number 70: Malevolent Sin, which doesn't synergize with the deck other than being a Level 4 XYZ monster. But, it does have the appearance of a spider, and it's always good to have. As it can gain high ATK, and can get some pesky monsters out of the way for the turn.</li>  	<li>Inzektor Picofalena, which can be used to equip Resonance Insect or Retaliating ""C"" onto another monster you control. Then you can get rid of the equipped monster, and activate their effects.</li>  	<li>Insect Shinobi Hagakuremino, which allows you to Special Summon an Insect Monster when a card it points to is destroyed. It's just generally helpful for the deck. Especially with Inzektor Picofalena.</li>  	<li>Seraphim Papillion also allows you to Special Summon Insects from your Graveyard. and works with Inzektor Picofalena as well.</li> </ul> <h4> Weaknesses</h4> Spiders have a lot of weaknesses. They have low stats, so it's easy to simply get beaten over if you don't have the proper defenses. The deck is generally inconsistent as well. As it requires multiple cards in your hand to do anything. Their biggest weakness however, is Link Monsters. As Link Monsters can't be in Defense Position. Thus being immune to all of the Spider's effects. <h4>Side Deck</h4> <ul>  	<li>Galaxy Cyclone and Mystical Space Typhoon are for basic spell removal. In case of any sort of floodgate, or any other devastating trap/spell.</li>  	<li>Mirror Force and Storming Mirror Force are mainly there to help deal with Link Monsters. As they can only be in Attack Position.</li>  	<li>Dark Mirror Force is a fun addition in general. If you could only put some of their monsters in defense position, and they try to attack.</li> </ul>"

Hand traps, as well as Destrudo, are meant to enable synchro plays with Odd-Eyes and level 9 synchros. The Zefra archetype cards are present to provide access to trap cards on short notice. Strategy is somewhat solid but deck composition is unrefined.  The first linked video shows the test hand replays made using this deck. The second linked video shows the exact deck list that is shown here but it also goes into the reasoning as to why each set of cards is played. The third linked video shows six different replays in which I describe the events of each duel through each play, at least for the most part.

Unexpected Dai, Tour Guide of the Underworld, Rescue Rabbit, Emergency Teleport. All get you the Tuner on field you need in order to get Halq out. Genex controller is a backup machine type monster in deck in the event you end up using 001 + Dai/E-Tele for your Tuner+1 into Halq. Kaiju's, Sphere Mode, and Nibiru serve the role to remove on-field threats either en-mass or strategically, specifically the wind and water kaiju's for Low Atk and dealing with Wind Barrier Statue.  The primary combo would seek to utilize Magikey Mechmusket - Batobuster as a major search engine. Ideally you would start with 1 in hand but if not there are methods to pull it out. A combo line that you would seek would be summoning Halq any way possible, pulling out 001 to link into Auroradon. This would pull out 3 tokens + 001 from the grave off of its own effect. Synchro for 4 into Herald of Arc light then use Auroradon to tribute Herald and a token to pull out Coltwing. This would give you 2 more tokens as well as either Batobuster or Advanced Ritual Art in order to summon one you may already have in your hand. This would then allow you to summon it allowing you to add Magikey World to your hand. This field spell is drastically overpowered not only adding you a Magikey Monster to your hand but more importantly allowing you to add the Fusion/Ritual spell as well as returning a Garnet back to your deck. At this stage you would want to add Magneficent Magikey Mafteal to your hand and trigger its effect for a 2nd normal summon. You do not have to normal summon it immediately at this point and it is recommended you don't. Using the 2nd effect of the Field spell allows you to add the Fusion/Ritual spell to your hand which enables Fusion/Ritual Summon from Deck while you control a normal monster, tokens included. This allows you to send any normal monster + 1 Magikey monster to Special Summon Magikey Beast Ansyalabolas, recycling your Ritual/Fusion spell. At this point you should have pulled out 001 off of Coltwing allowing you to Synchro for 7 for either Clear Wing Fast Dragon or F.A. Dawn Dragster (thank god the Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens are wind). You need to keep the token on field in order to trigger the ""Send from Deck"" effect of Magikey Mafeta. Fusing first then ritual summoning the 2nd time after recycling the spell would enable 2 level 4 tuners on the field at the same time as your Level 3 token and Level 7 Coltwing. You can Synchro for 7 first for Fast/Dawn (whichever one you didn't get first)  in order to drop Coltwings Level back to 4 in order to Synchro for 8. Savage if you own it or Dragite if you don't own a Savage. Halq serves as the water type for Dragrite if you are worried. This would give you Fast + Dragster + Savage/Dragite while having the triggered Magineficent Magikey in Hand. At this point Normal summon it and use its effect to special summon a non-tuner Magikey Monster for the Level 8 Synchro Transfurlmine. Transfurlmine allows you to set a magikey Spell/Trap from deck as well as a HOPT trap hole, it is recommended to set the Spell/Trap Magikey Counter Trap in order to not be nuked by Dark Ruler No More. This field should enable 1 Omni-Negate from Savage or a S/T Negate from Dragite, 1 S/T negate via Dragster, 1 Extra Deck monster negate via Fast, a Trap Hole from Transfurmine, and a counter trap negate from Magikey Unlocking. After that fill the deck with your favorite Fuse from deck monster that can use Normal-Monsters as fusion material such as Rainbow Neos, or Dragoon. Unfortunately there are no Normal Destiny Hero monsters for DPE and the Extra deck would be too cramped for it anyway. Alternate strategies include buffing the Hell out of Mechmoarter for a Monster effect negate thanks to its Atk gaining bonus.  Weaknesses include droplet, Dark ruler no more, generally any ""cannot respond"" cards.  P.S. It is possible in a severely desperate state to use the pendulum effects of Hallo Hallo and Magicalibra to increase the level of Dawn Dragster to extremes, buff its attack and pierce for game."

This is how you win with them without cheating like Zigfried did.  The win condition of the deck is resolving grass to get all combo pieces to Two(?) Turn Kill unprepared players which when it comes to meta decks is pretty much nobody. Most of the deck is tailored for that purpose and to improve consistency, you want to have Final Light or Ride of the Valkyries resolve to summon a few Valkyries to the board and get a second battlephase thanks to Mischief of the Time Goddess's unique effect. Goddess Urd's veredict protects your Valkyries while Jet Synchron and Halquifibrax are two very busted cards that net you some backup plays as well as more draw power thanks to a few busted Synchro monsters and will improve consistency, give you acceptable turn 1 boards with an Omni Negate, let you maybe survive another turn or even pick up wins against some weaker decks thanks to how busted Borreload Savage Dragon and Auroradon are.  Once you have picked up on the deck's main strategies it's almost as brainless as Numeron OTK, just more RNGish and harder to get enough firepower on the field to OTK. Remember how in the Anime they only played with 4000 LP? Yeah... A few things to keep in mind: Ride of the Valkyries while good, will shuffle back <strong>ALL</strong> monsters on your field back into the deck at the end of the turn, yes, including that Borreload you just made. <strong><em>UNLESS</em></strong> you have triggered Mischief of the time goddess in the same turn, except Mischief won't work if you have any monster that's not a Valkyrie on the field. So forget about comboing into Borreload to get more ATK on the board for the kill outside of the one in a thousand chance you got 2-3 high Level Valkyries + Borreload + Auroradon up and the opponent is pretty much wide open. That said because Mischief of the Time Goddess lets you bypass Ride of the Valkyries's second effect you're free to combo into Borreload to end your turn, so don't get hasty with that Jet Synchron/Plaguespreader Zombie effect in your GY. Playing smart will win you more duels.  Staples/Handtraps depend on meta/preference as well as Banlist availability. This whole deck is crippled if Grass gets banned/limited/negated so keep that in mind. Crossout Designator is maybe a card one should run at 3 depending on how many handtraps you use. In general you don't want to be running too many non normal spells/traps because you can use Valkyrie Vierte's effect to mill a few cards and maybe get one of Grass/Mallet/Ride of the Valkyries/Final Light onto your hand for a quite big consistency boost. As a rule of thumb, if you haven't won by turn 4 or at worst turn 6 you lost. If you bricked you lost. If the opponent is a decent player running a half decent deck you lost. Yeah, Valkyries are just not good on modern Yugioh and the only reason this kinda works is Grass is one of the most broken cards in the game."

This deck always wants to go first. The goal is to end your turn with Crystal Wing, High Flame King Genghis and Cursed King Siegfried on the field. This gives you 1 Monster effect negate, 1 spell/trap negate(2 spell/trap negates during your turn) and a monster that can swing over any level 5 or higher monster for 3,000 damage, regardless of how much attack the monster has. Here is an example of a standard combo for the deck:  Combo Pieces Needed: D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Necro Slime, D/D Lamia  As long as you have at least 2 of those 3 combo pieces you can usually search for the 3rd through Dark Contract with the Gate.  Example Hand: D/D Lamia, D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Savant Kepler, Any 2 other cards.  Combo for Example Hand: Normal Summon D/D Savant Kepler, use his effect to search for Dark Contract with the gate. Activate Dark Contract with the Gate. Search for the missing combo piece(in this case, D/D Necro Slime). Activate D/D Swirl Slime's effect, fusion summoning D/D/D Flame King Genghis using D/D Swirl Slime and D/D Necro Slime. Activate D/D Swirl Slime's effect in the graveyard to special summon D/D Lamia. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Flame King Genghis to Synchro summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander. Activate D/D Necro Slime's effect in the graveyard to fusion summon D/D/D High Flame King Genghis using D/D Necro Slime and D/D/D Flame King Genghis. Activate D/D/D Gust King Alexander's effect to summon D/D Lamia from the graveyard. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Gust King Alexander to Synchro summon D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried. Activate D/D/D High Flame King Genghis to special summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander from the graveyard. Activate D/D Lamia's effect in the graveyard, sending the Dark Contract with the Gate(or any of the cards remaining in your hand) to the graveyard to special summon her from the graveyard. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Gust King Alexander to special summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  There are MANY ways to do this combo within this deck, this is just one example of a standard way of creating your board. If anyone would like any tips/help with D/D/Ds let me know and I can offer my knowledge on the archetype. Pretty cheap deck to make in Master Duel as well. Enjoy! :D"

Any Krawler plus Suma can lead to Ghostrick Socuteboss into Ghostrick Angel of Mischief, activate their ability pitching Socuteboss to search Ghostrick shot, summon back Socuteboss, go into your second Angel of Mischief, searching Ghostrick scare, then make Utopic Future then Utopic Draco Future. This will leave two set monsters alongside your Utopic Draco Future and at least one backrow, all off of two cards. We play three World Legacy Survivor to search for Suma, and two Book of Taiyou, to flip Krawler Receptor and search for Suma. The two Lord of the Heavenly Prison are there to protect our set monsters and traps, which we want to have protected to provide interruption during our opponents turn (usually flipping Spine to pop a monster).&nbsp; Junk Sleep allows us to both flip up monsters, as well as flip them face down again, giving us more value off of our flip summons.</p>"

Choice is yours","  <strong>Watch the Video for Games on how the deck is played! and for questions comment on the video as I am only on this website once a day!</strong>  This deck is the real deal. Not only is this deck insanely good for the synchro festival, its insanely good in general. I am talking about going 15-0 in ranked just playing the deck, on top of that I hit plat in less than 3 hours of playing. (that's with breaks in between due to waiting 10 years for opponents turns) Most games Opponents will just scoop if they can't interact with your turn one because getting 2-3 negates is fairly easy with this deck. Now it is very vunerable to Nibiru but most decks in the event will be as well, you can argue putting some in for this list. I opted against so because I think there will be alot of backrow decks and lightning storm could help alot with that.  Edit: I want to preface going into early crystal wing synchron is a good play in this event as alot of people are running nibiru. Almost considering crossout designator"

[Made for Master Duel]","This deck is a relatively simple, somewhat budget approach to Skull Servants in Master Duel that only uses a few high rarity cards aside from the meta staples that you should already have. The deck largely runs itself; Clown Zombie mills Baking from deck, Baking grabs Prince &amp; Mare, dumps Prince. Prince mills a Servant and Lady, then banishes those for a King, and Mare discards for a Lady. Pretty basic, but what makes it shine is how versatile the deck can be with the extra deck. Since you have so many low attack monsters, Geonator Transverser can practically steal games by giving the opponent a weakling. Borrelsword can easily be link-climbed into from the basic opener by using Uni-zombie to go into Halqifibrax. And with some very careful planning, you can go from Halq into Shooting Riser into Ametrix and shut down opponent's attacks.  Of note is Nibiru. While in most decks, Nibiru requires you to have removal to avoid a massive token, KoSS can often simply overpower the token, especially with the help of Wightprincess.  Of the UR's present, i would say that the 3 Un-zombies and one Avendread Savior are non-negotiable. They make it so easy to get what you need, and their ability to discard both from the deck and hand can come in clutch. Many of the others are Staple cards that can be subbed in and out as your budget provides. Thankfully, a majority of the power players here are all found in the same Secret Pack, so 3-4 10pulls will give you most of what you need.  As for improvements to the deck, I would look towards MBT's excellent list that utilizes That Grass Looks Greener, found here: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxUO3oLaGcw</a> .  Thanks for checking my list out!"

Although the stigma to an FTK deck is that it's prone to bricking, this deck is very consistent since the six samurai engine is absolutely broken (I'm looking at you, Gateway of the Six !). <h4>Card Explanation:</h4> <h5>Monster Cards:</h5> <ul>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Fuma</strong> A monster that you can easily summon with one bushido counter on Shien's Dojo. That's basically the only thing he's used for.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> An easily summonable warrior monster for Isolde. It can also special summon a level-4 or lower warrior monster from your hand.</li>  	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Kageki</strong> Useful for first plays since it special summons other level-4 or lower six samurai monsters from your hand. It is also a great discard target for Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai since this card is easily searchable through Isolde</li>  	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai</strong> A staple for summoning Saryuja Skull Dread, Isolde, Bamboozling Gossip Shadow, Ghostrick Alucard-- basically summons everything.</li>  	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho</strong> Basically the same as Shinai, but it can free up your field for some more special summons.</li>  	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Kizan</strong> An easily summonable monster that is used to summon the XYZ monster that you need.</li>  	<li><strong>Grandmaster of the Six Samurai</strong> An easily summonable monster that is used as a different name for summoning Saryuja Skull Dread</li> </ul> <h5>Spell Cards:</h5> <ul>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn</strong> Used to be able to extend the combo for summoning Ghostrick Alucard</li>  	<li><strong>Upstart Goblin</strong> A free space on the deck. You can also replace this card with another draw card such as Into the Void</li>  	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> To search for Kizan/Kageki</li>  	<li><strong>Golden Bamboo Sword</strong> Helps with drawing cards you need. It is also easily searchable with Isolde by discarding Cursed Bamboo Sword</li>  	<li><strong>Shien's Smoke Signal</strong> To search for Kageki/Shinai/Mizuho</li>  	<li><strong>Overlay Regen</strong> A staple. You need this card in your hand to add a material to Heraldry Crest</li>  	<li><strong>Broken Bamboo Sword</strong> Used to enable Golden Bamboo Sword</li>  	<li><strong>Cursed Bamboo Sword</strong> Used to search Broken Bamboo Sword / Golden Bamboo Sword, depending on what you need</li>  	<li><strong>Moon Mirror Shield</strong> An Isolde target that can be returned to the deck</li>  	<li><strong>Living Fossil</strong> Another Isolde target, but it can also be used to special summon any level-4 or lower monster from your GY</li>  	<li><strong>""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""</strong> A card that can search for Fire Flint Lady / Mizuho, it is also a target for Isolde</li>  	<li><strong>Temple of the Six</strong> Free Bushido Counter generator</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai United</strong> A pot of greed that can generate Bushido Counter if need be</li>  	<li><strong>Gateway of the Six</strong> This card is not once per turn. So you can basically summon an infinite amount of monsters from your deck / GY</li>  	<li><strong>Shien's Dojo</strong> Another Bushido Counter generator, it can also be used as a combo extender to summon Ghostrick Alucard</li>  	<li><strong>Called by the Grave</strong> Just in case your opponent has Maxx ""C"" or Ash Blossom</li> </ul> <h5>Extra Deck:</h5> <ul>  	<li><strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong> The target for Heraldry Crest in order to summon Ghostick Angel of Mischief</li>  	<li><strong>Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</strong> Adds 5 materials to your Heraldry Crest</li>  	<li><strong>Daigusto Emeral</strong> You need 2 of this card to do the infinite draw combo. It is also used as a failsafe if your Heraldry Crest or Ghostrick Alucard gets nibiru'd</li>  	<li><strong>Heraldry Crest</strong> Since this card is a Number XYZ Monster, this card can be targeted by Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to add more materials to it. This card's name can be changed to another XYZ Monster's name, this is used to summon Ghostrick Angel of Mischief with 10 materials since after this card's effect is activated, its name becomes Ghostrick Alucard.</li>  	<li><strong>Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</strong> The core of your deck. This card can be summoned with 2 level 4 monsters OR another Ghostrick XYZ monster. If this card has 10 materials, you win the duel</li>  	<li><strong>Dugares the Timeless</strong> A level-4 XYZ monster that lets you draw 2 cards and discard 1 card. Make sure you have a throwable away card in your hand though in case both cards you drew are useful</li>  	<li><strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong> Used to search a discard target and a bamboo sword card. It is also used to special summon a Six Samurai monster for Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai. You can also use this card to bait Ash Blossom</li>  	<li><strong>Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai</strong> Free Bushido Counter generator. Most of the time, you'd want to summon your six samurai monsters to the zone this card points to. This card is also necessary to search for Gateway of the Six if you don't have it in your hand.</li>  	<li><strong>Saryuja Skull Dread</strong> A free draw and a free special summon. Necessary for infinite draws.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <h4>Early Game Combo:</h4> <ul>  	<li>Summon 2 warrior monsters from your hand using Kageki into another level-4 or lower Six Samurai, a Six Samurai monster + fire flint lady, Mizuho and Shinai, or any Six Samurai monster + Kizan.</li>  	<li>Summon Isolde using 2 warrior monsters to get a discard target + a bamboo card and to summon a Shinai.</li>  	<li>Summon Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai using Isolde and another Six Samurai monster. Make sure you bait out any negates such as Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence, etc before you summon this card.</li>  	<li>Get Gateway of the Six if you don't have it yet. If you do, get Shien's Dojo for combo extender or Six Samurai United for drawing cards.</li>  	<li>Special summon any six samurai monsters you have in your hand to get Bushido Counters on both Battle Shogun and Gateway of the Six</li>  	<li>From here on out, just draw cards using your extra deck monsters such as Dugares, Saryuja, or Daigusto Emeral</li> </ul>  <hr />  <h4>Win Condition Combo:</h4> <ul>  	<li>Summon Heraldry Crest first</li>  	<li>Then summon Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</li>  	<li>Activate Bamboozling Gossip Shadow, target Heraldry Crest</li>  	<li>Use either Monster Reborn, Living Fossil, or Shien's Dojo to special summon any level-3 Six Samurai</li>  	<li>Summon another level-3 using Gateway of the Six</li>  	<li>Summon Ghostrick Alucard with the two level-3 monsters you summoned before</li>  	<li>Activate Heraldry Crest, and target Ghostrick Alucard. Heraldry Crest's name is now Ghostrick Alucard</li>  	<li>Activate Overlay Regen, target Heraldry Crest</li>  	<li>Summon Ghostrick Angel of Mischief using Heraldry Crest</li> </ul>  <hr />  So how does one get to summon and draw all of those cards? Daigusto Emeral + Saryuja Skull Dread is absolutely broken, and with 2 Daigusto Emerals, it's basically an infinite draw. How? you may ask, here's the combo: <h4>Infinite Draw Combo:</h4> <ul>  	<li>Use Saryuja Skull Dread's effect to draw 4 cards, and return 3 to the deck</li>  	<li>Summon Mizuho and Shinai using Gateway of the Six</li>  	<li>Activate Mizuho's effect to tribute Shinai and destroy Saryuja Skull Dread</li>  	<li>Shinai's effect will activate in the graveyard to add 1 Six Samurai monster to your hand, add Kizan</li>  	<li>Special summon 2 Kizans, 1 from Shinai's effect and 1 from Gateway of the Six</li>  	<li>Summon Daigusto Emeral, activate its effect to add Saryuja, Daigusto Emeral, and another monster of your choice (preferably level-3 monsters)</li>  	<li>You can then summon Saryuja again and activate its effect since both Daigusto Emeral and Saryuja Skull Dread are not a hard once per turn.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <h4>What this deck is weak to:</h4> <ul>  	<li><strong>Early Nibiru</strong> Nibiru is absolutely devastating if you don't have Shien's Dojo or Monster Reborn in your hand/field. But if you have either of those, it's still fine.</li>  	<li><strong>Bricking</strong> This is a common problem for most decks, honestly. Although yes, this deck is consistent, it is as consistent as most decks, so there is still a possibility for bricking. A brick hand would be 5 spells that do not summon or add a Six Samurai monster to your hand/field, and that's basically it.</li>  	<li><strong>Battle Shogun being negated while not having Gateway of the Six in your hand/field.</strong> Gateway of the Six is the core of this deck.

One of this deck's strategies is Ghostrick Dullahan combined with Ghostrick Ghoul.  First, you must swarm your board with Ghostrick monsters the easiest way to do this is through Ghostrick Frost, Lantern, and Mary they can all special summon themselves face down when an opponent declares a direct attack which pairs nicely with the field spells. Once you have a decent enough monster on the field with ghoul and Dullahan all ready first use the Ghouls effect to flip it face down and let Dullahan gain the attack then use one of Dullahan's materials to half the attack of an opponents monster then attack it.

Presenting, Synchro Goodstuff.  ""Why play this deck?""  Well... the Synchro Festival is up, and if you're tired of playing the same shit, and by that I mean Virtual World, here's a more of an old school classic of a strategy, and if you might have noticed, this engine is all gas and nothing but Synchro 8 engines. I will discuss more of the nuances in the list as I go through the individual cards. This list's game plan only revolves around one thing: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and/or bring out <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> as quick as you can and use them to either aggressively interrupt your opponent at their most crucial choke points or defensively depending on the situation. Anyway, the list.  <strong>The Main Deck, where I will discuss in engines:</strong>  <strong>• The Assault Mode engine</strong> - <span>This is the first half of your strategy, which only has one goal in mind and that is to bring out its archetypal boss monster <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> as quick as it can. Here's their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</strong></a> - <span>Your first boss monster. Requires a Stardust Dragon to be tributed for its Special Summon but that's hardly a problem for a deck that can turbo out Level 8 Synchros. Has a once per turn omni negation effect, and can bring itself back during the End Phase of the turn it is used.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psi-Reflector&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psi-Reflector</strong></a> - <span>Your main starter of the engine and is the Tuner, with a great and versatile level of 1 for any Synchro focused strategy, and both a Search effect to initiate your combos and a Level modulating effect that can be relevant to your needs.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Sentinel&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Sentinel</strong></a> - <span>Your secondary starter of the engine. Brings out Psi-Reflector from the Deck, and has a Type modulating effect that is actually valuable in other strategies, but not on this one since Levels are our only concern.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Beast&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Beast</strong></a> - <span>Your main search target if you didn't open Assault Sentinel to search Assault Mode Activate.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Teleport&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Teleport</strong></a> - <span>Allows you to fix your hand in case you drew your Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and draws you 2 cards.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Mode Activate&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong></a> - <span>The centerpiece of the Deck, you always want to have at least 1 copy of this card in your hand, and that's why we play 2 of it. It enables your Psi-Reflector's effect and allows you to bring out <strong><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a></strong> during your opponent's turn. Your secondary search target if you opened Assault Sentinel.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Ascator engine</strong> - <span>A one card Synchro 8 engine that only consists of two cards, being <a data-name=""Ascator, Dawnwalker"">Ascator, Dawnwalker</a> and <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a> as his target.</span>  <strong>• The Dragunity engine</strong> - <span>This list actually contains two Dragunity engines. The first one being <a data-name=""Dragunity Dux"">Dragunity Dux</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Phalanx"">Dragunity Phalanx</a>, and <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</a>, a more fragile one card combo that requires your Normal Summon with the help of a graveyard setup, usually facilitated by <a data-name=""Cards of Consonance"">Cards of Consonance</a>, and the second newer one consisted of <a data-name=""Dragunity Remus"">Dragunity Remus</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Legatus"">Dragunity Legatus</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</a>, and <a data-name=""Mist Valley Baby Roc"">Mist Valley Baby Roc</a>, both of which can easily bring out <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> under 5 Summons, the only difference is that the latter does not consume your Normal Summon.</span>  <strong>• The Windwitch engine</strong> - <span>This engine is usually used alongside Speedroids, since they are not only synergistic lore-wise but also in game. It xenolocks us from Special Summoning other monsters but WIND attribute monsters, but it doesn't really matter outside of the Assault Mode and the Ascator engine. Here are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Ice Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Ice Bell</strong></a> - <span>You'd ideally want to start with her since she has an effect that allows herself to be Special Summoned if you control no other monsters.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Glass Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Glass Bell</strong></a> - <span>She has an effect that allows you to search a ""Windwitch"" monster upon her Normal or Special Summon, except a copy of herself.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Snow Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Snow Bell</strong></a> - <span>She has an effect that allows herself to be Special Summoned if you control 2 or more WIND attribute monsters, which we play more than enough of.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Staples</strong> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Cards of Consonance&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Cards of Consonance</strong></a> - <span>Provides draw power and GY setup. Not once per turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Avarice&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Avarice</strong></a> - <span>Provides draw and recycling power which will be helpful on cases where you have opening hands that have a dead Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode and you have no other choice but to use it as a discard fodder for anything.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Monster Reborn&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Monster Reborn</strong></a> - <span>Reborns a monster.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Teleport&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Emergency Teleport</strong></a> - <span>Provides access to the Assault Mode engine without costing your Normal Summon of the turn. Can be activated during the Draw and Standby Phase of your turn, which plays around Droll &amp; Lock Bird.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Ravine&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragon Ravine</strong></a> - <span>Targets for Dragunity Remus, and is an essential component for the Dragunity engine. Provides either GY setup or a search.</span></li> </ol> <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a></strong> - <span>It's no coincidence that she got released before the event. If you have a deck that can occasionally bring her out, there's no reason not to. She has a OPT pop effect, once per face up negation effect, and an effect that allows herself to be recycled in order to revive any Level 9 or lower monster in your GY, which would be more often either Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon or a Stardust Dragon.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>The boss monster of the deck. Has both a monster negation effect that boosts its own ATK and another ATK boosting effect when it battles any Level 5 or higher monster during the Damage Calculation.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>If you can make it in a Synchro deck, there's no reason not to.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Has a decent negation effect against destruction card effects, but it's only relevant as a target for Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Barcha"">Dragunity Knight - Barcha</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Baronne De Fleur.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Has arguably better negation effects than Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon since it has two instead of just one, but does not have the combat protection through ATK boosting.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Windwitch - Winter Bell"">Windwitch - Winter Bell</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Windwitches. Has a burn effect that is always welcome than having nothing else.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Dragunities, usually through Dragunity Remus and Dragunity Legatus.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Dragunities, usually through Dragunity Dux and Dragunity Phalanx.</span>  Final Thoughts:  I mean... it's Crystal Wing/Assault Mode engine turbo.dek. Sure, some people might say that it's a boring way to play the event but, Crystal Wing is a good boss monster, and so is Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and if it does the job right, you know... can you really complain? Gotta get those gems somehow, am I right? As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

The Frog engine is one of the best engines you can use, as it ends on a free Negate through any means of your Gigantic or Elf.  The use of the Adventurer engine is another back bone in the version that is played because it is a Negate before your Gigantic Splight hits the field so you have a little more protection in case of a hand trap."

","Still some bricking, but not as bad as some other decks, and if you can survive a turn you'll usually draw into something to get your combos started  One each of Knight and Brave since I felt like I was bricking too much with more than one of each 2 Vanishers since 3 never felt necessary One wizard because personally I don't summon him too often and when I do, he's my normal summon so I VERY rarely want two in hand Dragon Buster to lock opponents out of the extra deck for however long - swap this with a second Wizard if you'd like but know that it can only be equipped through Union Carrier's effect to other dragons Nebula Dragon - Basically a free rank 8 especially if you don't see a way to get out GEPD or any other level 8  in your hand BUT you should know it locks you into only summoning dragons for the rest of your turn, so make sure you can win that turn or survive if you play this Galaxy Trance - Pretty good for late game as long as you can pay the cost, but I don't really see the need for more than one. Searchable with Wizard's effect 2 Galaxy Expedition - 3 also feels unnecessary 1 Lightning Storm - Just a going second card to bait or even wipe if you can  Extra deck Ahashima - For late game and to basically turn two level 4's into a rank 8 1 Photon Lord - Most decks run 2. You can if you want I just needed room Draglubion and Numeron Dragon - I was playing Nova and Infinity and the two of them are extremely consistent in this deck, I just got bored of it because you can honestly summon them almost every game. That being said I recommend playing one or the other unless you decide to take out maybe Zues and Ahashima."

Esse Deck de 40 estampas é para celebrar a estratégia dos grandes Dragões utilizada por Seto Kaiba na série animada clássica de Yu-Gi-Oh!. O Deck inclui Dragões com Níveis 7 e 8 capazes de banir cartas do oponente quando forem Invocados, ganhando mais pontos de ataque para cada carta banida. Também estão inclusos novos monstros Sincro e XYZ fáceis de Invocar para ajudar seus Dragões rapidamente. A melhor parte é que esse deck funciona com QUALQUER Dragão de Nível 7 ou 8, incluindo os Dragões de outros Decks e coleções.  O verdadeiro trunfo do Deck Temático Renascimento dos Verdadeiros Dragões é um card de Magia que permite a Invocação de qualquer Dragão de Nível 7 ou 8 diretamente do Cemitério sem restrições, além de poder ser utilizada posteriormente para proteger seus Dragões da destruição, sem inconvenientes ou limitações. É um card essencial para todos os Decks de Dragões!

Rather than going for Giant Ballpark or Cocoon of Evolution plays i decided that the most consistent way to play the deck was to focus on getting insects disruption onto the board. I found that Danger's and Sekka's Light made my combos much more consistent allowing me to get at the very least a Seraphim Papillon and a Number 3: Cicada King onto the board with Battlewasp: Sting the Poison and/or Scary Moth in the graveyard or hand as summonable targets on my opponents board. The deck can make use of Baronne De Fleur, Desert Locusts and Crystron Halqifibrax as additional or alternative interaction to the monsters mentioned before."

Tried to make it budget friendly but due to the need for staples and combo extenders it's quite high in the low-end category.  Ideally plays second to respond with cards like dingirsu, rusty bardiche, and dharc; can also play first and interrupt with babel.  This deck plays the dragon link engine to quickly get DARK effect monsters on the field as link or synchro material, the phantom knights' engine as a combo extender / board break when paired with dingirsu - as well as a few negates and searches, and the sky striker engine to build material turn 1. Previous lists included trickstars however they were since removed for causing bricks and wasting a normal summon or the field spell slot.  My favourite matchup is vs. red-eyes, or really any deck with the dragoon engine. If you don't have a kaiju in hand, bait the negate and then go into ding with any 2 effect monsters, sending dragoon to the grave. Then, use ding and one other DARK monster to go into dharc the dark charmer and steal their dragoon from grave. You get a free negate, and your opponent is very sad. Cymbal can also revive ding from your grave next turn if you would like to keep destruction protection on the field.  This deck uses effect veiler as its main handtrap to ensure that chaos ruler will have material to revive itself after destruction, and it's a cheaper alternative to ash blossom while still having some of the upsides and downsides. I run raidan as my kaiju of choice since it is a dark monster, so if necessary I can play it mid-turn while being locked into DARK summons. There's also a gadarla in the side deck if you get statued. While I tend to avoid LP cost cards, I do run a destrudo since it can turbo clear wing, or be used as material for crystron halqifibrax without a normal summon (which can then search a bombard for even more combos). I don't play any ""pot of"" cards in this deck as I have found that banishing cards that are only played at 1-2 copies can significantly slow or even instantly scoop the deck, and I can't play duality because I need my normal summon. There are some other choices I made when building this deck that seem wrong compared to other, but I can't list them all here since it would be a very long paragraph.  If you need any help learning the deck or you would like to contact me, drop a message to hhez#7601  Thanks for taking time to check out my deck, I spent a LOT of time refining this through competitive gameplay and it was rather expensive to do so. If you found this helpful, please like the decklist. :)"

Even with the loss of the VFD Virtual World didn't need much time to fit the best way to play but now it's turned to a more friendly combo where you pass with <strong>solid interactions and a lot of advantage</strong> and follow up in the process. The main features that make Virtual World a unique deck in the game is mainly its way of playing which is a very smart card design and the <strong>restrictions that Archetype itself has</strong> when starting to play on te lock in <strong>Special Summoning only Monsters that have Level/Rank 3 or higher</strong>. This means that after resolving the effects of the Main Deck monsters that activate from the hand, you can only Summon Monsters from the Main Deck of Level 3 or higher, and regarding the Extra Deck you will only have the disposal to make <strong>Synchro Monsters of Level 3 or higher and Rank-3 or higher XYZ monsters</strong>. And since virtually all <strong>Virtual World monsters are Level 3 or Level 6</strong> you will almost always be limited to making <strong>Level 6, 9, and 12 Synchro Monsters and Rank 3, 6, 9, and 12 XYZ</strong> Monsters. , this deck <strong>does not use LINK Monsters to play</strong> even though you can technically Link Summon before activating the Virtual World Monsters effects in 99% of decklists you will not see any LINK monsters being used in the Extra Deck which brings even more credibility to the gameplay of this archetype since there is <strong>no need to use LINK-2 Enabler to play differently from several Metagame decks</strong> that would become 10 times worse than they are without Crystron Halqifibrax, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights, Aromaseraphy Jasmine, Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss among other generic LINK cards that may be banned in the near future. The biggest problem with Virtual World has always been the <strong>issue of Consistency</strong> because when it comes out of inertia this is one of the <strong>most resilient decks in the game</strong> as you work with Archetype card movement in all possible places: <strong>hand effects, field effects , GY effects and even banned cards are relevant</strong>. That's why you dodge many interactions in the form of Hand Trap when playing from Virtual World like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and even high impact Hand Traps like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> can be won by the simple factor of opening with multiple Virtual World names in hand.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////The <strong>deck's gameplay is based on the 3 types of cards in the game: Monsters, Spells and Traps</strong>. Basically you start your moves by activating the effects of the following <strong>Virtual World Monsters in your hand</strong>: <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a>, <a data-name=""Xiezhi - Jiji"">Xiezhi - Jiji</a>, <a data-name=""Kirin - Lili"">Kirin - Lili</a> and <a data-name=""Roshi - Laolao"">Roshi - Laolao</a> and for that they have a <strong>common requirement of needing to target a Virtual World card on your field</strong> to activate its effects and take an action and Special Summon it from your hand. The action they take is for you to <strong>send a Virtual World card from your Deck to the Graveyard of a different Type than the Virtual World card on the field you targeted</strong> to activate its effect. For example if you target a Monster like <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> you must send a Spell or Trap from Virtual World to the GY for the monster to Special Summon, if it is targeted in a Spell like <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> you send a Monster or Trap and if for a Trap like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> you send a Monster or a Spell to the GY. These monsters do yet another <strong>action when Special Summoned</strong>: <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> <strong>adds a Virtual World card from your Deck to your hand</strong> of a <strong>Third Type</strong> different from the card you targeted on the field and the one you sent to the GY , so if you targeted a Monster and sent Spell <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to the GY for example you can add a Trap to your hand like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> which makes it the <strong>best card in the Deck</strong> as it gives you access to 2 Potential Virtual names World to continue playing and generate a lot of advantage and game volume in addition to being a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong>. <a data-name=""Xiezhi - Jiji"">Xiezhi - Jiji</a> has the perk effect of <strong>retaining Follow Up in the End Phase</strong> of your turn when adding a Virtual World Monster from your GY to your hand. <a data-name=""Kirin - Lili"">Kirin - Lili</a> can <strong>send a Virtual World card from your Deck to the GY of a Third type</strong> different from the card you targeted on the field and the first one you sent to the GY, so if you targeted a Trap like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> for example and sent Spell <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to GY you can add send a Virtual World Monster to GY like <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a>. And finally <a data-name=""Roshi - Laolao"">Roshi - Laolao</a> is the <strong>best Extender of the deck</strong> since in addition to being a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong> it has the additional effect of giving <strong>Monster Reborn from a Virtual World in your GY</strong> in Defense Position (and with the effects negated) which allows you to make <strong>very aggressive plays</strong>. A curiosity about these effects of handheld Virtual World Monsters as well as <strong>Archetype Drytron Monsters</strong> such as <a data-name=""Drytron Alpha Thuban"">Drytron Alpha Thuban</a> for example is that in the resolution of the Special Summon effect you <strong>resolve the additional advantage effect of the card</strong>, that is, at the same time as you Special Summoned <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> to the field you will <strong>add a Virtual World card to the hand</strong> and that way this deck has great <strong>resilience to cards that negate monster effects on the field</strong> like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> with you being able to even OTK over the effect of Floodgates like Skill Drain because it <strong>doesn't affect your build play</strong>, but rather affects the Extra Deck monsters you bring onto the field only. Usually you always access <a data-name=""Lulu"">Lulu</a> in all Combos whether Turn 1 or Grind Game, <a data-name=""Lili"">Lili</a> is a great Starter also on turn 1 but in the next turns he gets a little weakened since you already have so many Virtual World cards in the GY and banned that its added effect of sending one more Virtual World card to the GY becomes a bit redundant. <a data-name=""Laolao"">Laolao</a> is <strong>not a good Starter</strong> because its additional effect is only relevant when you <strong>already have Virtual World Monsters in your GY</strong> but it is an excellent <strong>Extender and Follow Up</strong> in the deck and finally <a data-name=""Jiji"">Jiji</a> is a good card to have at your disposal throughout the game.  The only Virtual World Monsters in the Main Deck that <strong>do not have a Hand effect</strong> are <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> and <a data-name=""Toutou"">Toutou</a>, as Toutou is little explored in the deck I will focus only on <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> but the basic purpose of the two cards is the same: They are the <strong>main Normal Summons of the deck</strong> since Virtual World does not need to be Normal Summoned to play but even then <strong>you will often not have a Virtual World Spell/Trap to target and activate the effects of hand Virtual Worlds</strong> so you will need to <strong>Normal Summon these cards</strong> to the field to start playing. <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> being a <strong>Level 3 Psychic Monster</strong> can be Special Summoned straight from the Deck with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a> and that way you have 4 copies of Nyannyan in the deck to increase consistency, plus <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> has a very <strong>good GY effect</strong> to <strong>come back to the field if you Normal or Special Summon a Level 3 Monster</strong>, with the detail of becoming a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong> and that will be <strong>banished when it leaves the field</strong> for a Synchro Summon for example. And finally if that wasn't enough it has an excellent effect when it is banned from you to <strong>target any card in your ban zone (except itself) and shuffle back into the deck</strong>. The detail of this effect is that you <strong>can shuffle Face-Down cards</strong> that you banished with the activation of <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> for example so even if an important card of your deck <strong>mainly the Virtual World Spells/Traps</strong> that are important to keep in circulation in the Deck you can recover for use in the next turn. That way even the <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> Drawback can be mitigated in the Virtual World deck.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////And to complete the excellent Main Deck of <strong>Virtual World we have the Spells/Traps</strong>: starting with the Spells we have the <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> which is an <strong>excellent Starter of the deck</strong> because it simply <strong>place any of the Spell/Trap Virtual World Gate directly from the Deck to the field</strong> being the main move put <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> face-up since targeting Trap is the best type of card to resolve the effects of the hand's Virtual Worlds in addition to <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> being an <strong>interaction by itself in the form of a pop of Face-Up cards on the field</strong> (including your own cards) by giving <strong>2 banished Virtual World Cards Shuffle back to the deck</strong>, but we can also put <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> on the field in some situations if we want to <strong>negate the effect of an opponent's Monster</strong> like <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> and that's enough banish the very <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> you used to place Qinglong face-up. <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> also has <strong>additional effects</strong> according to the number of <strong>""Virtual World Gate"" Card you control</strong> at card resolution highlighting the Bonus effect of your Virtual World monsters gaining <strong>200ATK</strong> and for the effect of <strong>Sending the top 3 cards of your Deck for the GY</strong>. Detail: it is because of the possibility that in the Kauwloon resolution you have 3 ""Virtual World Gate"" face-up Cards on the field that your opponent can give <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in the Kauwloon effect. All <strong>Virtual World Gate Spells/Traps shine in terms of GY effects</strong> and are essential in building plays: <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> is nothing less than the <strong>Archetype's ROTA</strong> in Spell form because it can <strong>banish itself from GY to add a Monster Virtual World</strong> from the Deck to the hand and at resolution you <strong>must discard a card from the hand</strong>.  <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a>, in addition to being an absurd <strong>interaction card that destroys face-up cards on the field every turn</strong> while <strong>recycling your banished Virtual World cards</strong> back to the Deck, it also has a great <strong>GY effect</strong> from during your Main Phase if you banish yourself to target a <strong>Virtual World Monster and increase or decrease its Level by 3</strong> allowing for excellent <strong>Synchro and XYZ plays</strong>. Finally, just talk about <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a>, which is basically the <strong>Archetype's Monster Reborn</strong>, bringing him with the effects negated and in the resolution, just like <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>, <strong>you have to discard a card from your hand to the GY</strong>. <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> has a <strong>field effect in the Battle Phase</strong> of changing a monster's battle position but you rarely use it to your advantage since pretty much the only time you activate it on the field is when you brick and you still have to control another ""Virtual World"" Gate"" to activate this effect, that is, uncommon to happen but it is useful to prevent the opponent from doing <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> in Main Phase 2 when putting his <strong>XYZ Monster in Defense Position</strong> for example.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Extra Deck's Virtual World monsters</strong> are divided between <strong>Synchro 6 and 9 and XYZ Rank 3 and 6</strong>. Some of them have the <strong>particularity of having effects that mention Monsters with the SAME Type and Attribute or Monsters with DIFFERENT Types and Attributes</strong> and the Virtual World Monsters are split between <strong>WIND Psychic</strong> and <strong>EARTH Wyrm</strong> so that these effects can take place. Often non-Archetype monsters like Synchro and generic XYZ and Deck-used Hand Traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> fall into these requirements for DIFFERENT Types and Attributes. In general the <strong>XYZ RANK-3 are little used</strong> despite having good interaction effects, highlighting the <a data-name=""Shell - Jaja"">Shell - Jaja</a> which is an easy way to make <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> from above as it can protect itself from destruction in battle. RANK-6 <a data-name=""Phoenix - Fanfan"">Phoenix - Fanfan</a> is an excellent card that should definitely be used in Virtual World decks because it has the <strong>effect of banishing a card that the opponent controls and 1 card in his GY</strong> also being double interaction and also has a <strong>great floating effect</strong> when destroyed to <strong>Special Summon 2 ""Virtual World"" Monsters with the SAME Type and Attribute</strong>. <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> is the Deck's Synchro-9 <strong>Boss Monster and has a Floodgate effect that perfectly matches the Archetype</strong>: <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> theme for <strong>any card that would be sent from the field to the GY</strong>. As you have <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> to <strong>shuffle the banished cards back to the deck</strong> you don't mind playing over Shenshen's Floodgate effect different from your opponent who will have a complete nightmare when trying to play this <strong>""Macro Cosmos with legs""</strong> because virtually no <strong>Link Summon decks</strong> can play with Link materials being banished instead of going to the GY, the same goes for <strong>Synchro decks</strong> that need to send monsters from the field to the GY as well, <strong>Pendulum Monsters</strong> are banished instead of going for the face-up Extra Deck, <strong>Eldlich and True Draco</strong> Cards also lose all their value when they leave the field because they are banished, only <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> decks can play a little around Shenshen because <strong>XYZ Material is not considered a card in the field</strong> and are not banned when detaching from Monster XYZ. And to make your opponent worse, it's no use taking Shenshen off the field because he <strong>himself returns to the field on the next turn</strong> without being the one sent to the GY when <strong>banishing 2 Monsters from your GY with DIFFERENT Original Types and Attributes</strong>. Finally we have the Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Beast - Jiujiu"">Beast - Jiujiu</a> which is <strong>another interaction card</strong> with the opponent from the Virtual World deck that <strong>sends any card on the field to the GY when banishing 2 Monsters in your GY with the SAME Original Type and Attribute</strong>, and it still <strong>protects itself from destruction by battle or card effects</strong> while you have 2 or More Monsters in your GY with <strong>SAME Orginal Type and Attribute</strong>, but different names.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////As soon as you <strong>resolve 1 of the Hand Effects of Virtual World Monsters you can make the default end board of the deck</strong> by easy access to <a data-name=""Lulu"">Lulu</a> with <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>. So you don't need a lot of cards to play turn 1, just going along that you'll <strong>need more extend to get over your opponent's interactions</strong>. It's about <strong>maintaining Card Advantage</strong> while you play and knowing <strong>how to manage your resources</strong> because Virtual World is <strong>one of the best Grind Game decks in the game for the ease of recycling all the cards even if banned</strong>, having a constant game volume. I've even come across my opponent using <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> to negate <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a>'s summon and I simply used <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> I had on the field to banish Shenshen and negate any monster on the field and then I used <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> eff when banished to <strong>return Shenshen to Extra Deck</strong>, so it's very simple to keep pressure on the opponent with your Boss Monster coming back every turn.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Basic combos for SYNCHRO FESTIVAL</strong>, I'm sure some of these combos can be done more efficiently because I'm not an expert in this deck leaving it up to you to improve what can be improved. A detail in some combos is that I'm only using <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> in my Master Duel build because I don't want to Craft <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> so in these combos I talk about doing <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> instead of <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and what happens is that you <strong>pretty much always make these cards the same way</strong> because even though Ultimaya Tzolkin has no level in the Extra Deck you always make it using a <strong>Level 6 Tuner Monster and a Level 6 non-Tuner</strong> in the Virtual World deck which is the same way to do Final Sigma. The real detail is to remember that you <strong>can't do Ultimaya Tzolkin if Shenshen is on the field</strong> so always do the <strong>Tzolkin first before Shenshen</strong> and that you'll need to <strong>set a Spell/Trap to bring Crystal Wing to the field</strong> and in the combos themselves you have this option because many times you use <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> to add <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> to the hand or <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> so you can first set these cards on the field to trigger eff of <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and then if it is <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> you activate to put <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> face-up but of course you could set a <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> or an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to have the same result in cases where you don't have a Virtual World Spell/Trap in hand, so these are the details of using Tzolkin's engine and Crystal Wing on the Virtual World deck.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>LULU COMBOS:</strong>  <strong>COMBO 1: Lulu +

Chuche /in Hand: /in GY: Qinglong /Banished: 2 VW Cards  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //<strong>Technoplay:</strong>  Not wanting to be the owner of reason but I consider that playing Virtual World in Master Duel without <strong>3</strong> <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and without the <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> <strong>package</strong> is playing completely wrong with this deck. This is the <strong>best deck to use Pot of Desires</strong> because you <strong>don't care about any downside of the card</strong> whether it's the <strong>risk of banishing an important card or drawing more copies of Desires</strong> itself so you should maximize this card for the highest possible probability to see it in the starting hand or during the <strong>Draws of Extra Deck monsters</strong> during the standard Deck Combo. And the <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> works like a <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> in this deck because it can always protect you from <strong>taking interactions in the form of a Hand Trap in the first Virtual World effect you resolve in your hand</strong>, in addition to being the best hand trap by itself <strong>high impact in the game</strong> as it not only <strong>negates the monster but also destroys it</strong>, an essential versatility card that should be at 3 on the Master Duel banlist instead of semi-limited.  About <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: If you <strong>already have plays you don't start using Desires</strong>, but first try to play and <strong>access the engine cards so that when you use Desires you don't have the risk of banishing some important combo piece</strong> especially <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> which is the <strong>only one-off engine card</strong>, but also having access to <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> and <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>'s second copy in <strong>circulation makes a difference</strong>. So it's more about you <strong>accessing the Virtual World Spells/Traps before using Desires</strong> because the Virtual World monsters themselves practically never make a difference when banned even in 2 copies because the important thing is to have a copy of them available and not multiples. <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> Interaction: if you have <strong>Nyannyan on the field that came back from the GY</strong> by its own effect <strong>and Desires in hand</strong>, you <strong>first use Desires before Synchro Summoning using Nyannyan</strong> because if you <strong>banish a card that you want to return to the deck</strong> with Desires, that Nyannyan will play that role but if you Synchro Summon first you won't get that chance to recycle the right card back into the deck.  A very important detail that some people forget about using the <a data-name=""Tzolkin"">Tzolkin</a> in the Virtual World deck is that it <strong>conflicts with the Shenshen in the summon condition</strong> because you necessarily need to send the materials for the <a data-name=""Tzolkin"">Tzolkin</a>'s Special Summon to the GY but this is impossible to do happens while you're under the effect of <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> so you can't do Tzolkin if Shenshen is on the field and that's why in plays involving Tzolkin you do Shenshen only towards the end of the Combo.  In very specific situations you can use <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to <strong>negate your own</strong> <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> if you are going to make a <strong>Synchro move that needs materials to be sent to the GY</strong>. It was <strong>necessary to have a lot of VW monsters</strong> from the GY for turn 3 plays, whether in giving Reborn from <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> or to other cards like <a data-name=""Laolao"">Laolao</a> and <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a>. Returning <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> to the GY with <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen <strong>eff in Battle Phase</strong></a> proved to be very necessary in the <strong>grind game and many times I want to go to the Battle Phase to return it and then in the M2 I special Lulu or Jiji to trigger Nyan</strong>.  When you <strong>play without Spells/Traps Virtual World as a target</strong> too many times to resolve the second VW effect you <strong>will have to do one of Archetype's Synchro Monsters </strong>and not <a data-name=""Stardust Warrior"">Stardust Warrior</a> etc to continue playing. Always analyze when <strong>your play is stopped on the only VW name you had if there is a way you can try to ensure you have a target on the table as a target for the next turn</strong> because if not you can even stop the opponent with the various hand traps that fit in the deck but will have no play on the return. I learned by playing the Synchro event that in these cases it is <strong>always better to keep a possible target of the VW effects in the safest way possible so as not to fall into situations like drawing a name and not being able to activate it</strong>.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> is Level 2 so you <strong>can only bring it onto the field</strong> with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a> if you <strong>haven't resolved any Virtual World effects from your hand</strong> this turn. Interactions of <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and a monster in the GY like <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> activating <strong>effect to return to the field</strong> are quite interesting because you can use <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> as <strong>Chain Link 2 to Shenshen's effect to negate an opponent's monster</strong> while you control no cards on the field.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //<strong>Disregard the Side Deck, these are just examples of cards that can also be used in the deck. And about the Extra Deck I also talk about the main cards needed since this Extra Deck doesn't need all these cards to play Virtual World.</strong>  - The first three cards close the Synchro monsters that I consider useful to use in the Virtual World for the Synchro format and the <a data-name=""Mist Wurm"">Mist Wurm</a> would be an SR version of the <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> since its summon condition is the same, the <a data-name=""XX-Saber Gottoms"">XX-Saber Gottoms</a> is used in a more <strong>fun version of the deck</strong> focused on <strong>Looping it back onto the field</strong> with <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a> so that it uses its <strong>non-Hard Once Per Turn effect of Tributing itself and discarding a random card from the opponent's hand</strong> and to do this Loop is used a monster called <a data-name=""Beast of the Pharaoh"">Beast of the Pharaoh</a> that <strong>simply returns to the field whenever used as Synchro Material</strong> allowing you to continue making <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a> and <strong>discarding up to 4 cards from your opponent's hand</strong>, the only problem with this combo is that you have to Hard Draw of the <a data-name=""Beast of the Pharaoh"">Beast of the Pharaoh</a> to be your Normal Summon. <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a> is yet another Level 8 Dragon-type Synchro option to bring to the field with <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> when you set a Spell/Trap on the field.  But my <strong>real Extra Deck that I used to finish the Synchro Festival</strong> did not have all these options that I present to you, it was the following: 2 <a data-name=""Stardust Charge Warrior"">Stardust Charge Warrior</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu"">Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</a>, 1 Virtual World <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a>. And between these cards Raptite and Geomathmech Final Sigma I'm only using it because I already had it on my account and you can get <a data-name=""Crocodragon"">Crocodragon</a> by <strong>opening Legacy Pack</strong>. So I built this deck at the end <strong>spending 2 UR which were Shenshen and Jiujiu</strong> and the rest were the <strong>Virtual World main deck SR cards and the extra Deck Level 6 and Level 9 SR monsters</strong> so you don't need to craft <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> to play Virtual World at this event.  - Some <strong>tech card choices for consistency</strong>: <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> and <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a> have the versatility that it doesn't even matter if you draw Metalfoes Fusion because you discard it by the effects of <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> and <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> to use the effect to go back to the Deck and <strong>give 1 Draw</strong>, on the other hand, <a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a> is interesting in the deck given the <strong>high number of Level 6 monsters we use</strong>. <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> is the second best Pot to use in Virtual World but it doesn't even come close to <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and finally <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> which needs no introduction of how good a consistency card it is.  - <a data-name=""Genex Ally Birdman"">Genex Ally Birdman</a>, <a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a> are <strong>Level 3 Extenders options</strong> to use in the deck allowing you to make plays like <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> and give you even more targeting options to bring into the field with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a>. <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> is an Extender option to access <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> in the Virtual World deck because you <strong>target any Level 3 monster you control and for half its LP cost it enters the field as a Level 4 monster</strong> Tuner allowing to make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> together with a Level 6 monster.  - Finally, we have <strong>floodgates</strong> like <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> that can be used on the deck <strong>without affecting the gameplay too much</strong>, but you should train a lot especially with <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> before you start using it because it has a <strong>certain restriction on the way to do your Combo</strong> while it's activated. The funny thing about using Floodgates in this deck is that you <strong>can turn them off whenever you want</strong> with the <a data-name=""Virtual World Gate - Chuche"">Virtual World Gate - Chuche</a> that can destroy your own cards.  &nbsp;"

The Build seems to provide good disruptions against meta decks but still lacks the grind game. If your opponent lets you play with minimal disruptions the end boards can be tough to out with the constant recycling of the Branded card and Fusion monsters, and the link climb to Shuraig.

Usually ends in 2 quick effect banishes and 1 Omni negate. Your goal is to make aurodon at any cost, then ladder into your shoguns and barrone. It dies to one handtrap but there are ways to mitigate that like crossout.  Card by card time  Main Deck:  Anchor Drill - This deck really needs to open at least one extender to get to halq. This plus any Karakuri tuner, which you run 10 of, is full combo.  Heavy Forward - One more heavy forward and it can bait out ash if your opponent is bad.  Ready and Instant fusion - These are free, non normal summon tuner and earth machine extenders. Gamma oil - You also want to draw this. Later on in the combo it can make big plays and it can set up the combo earlier on.  Ninishi - This card is great whether you draw it or not. This plus any Karakuri is full combo (This includes gamma oil). You can also grab it from your deck to get an extra normal summon. That’s a search with merchant, that gets kumanzan, that gets you an end board with another one or two negates. If you just have a tuner, its still another negate.  Merchant - As stated in Ninishi, this card is a great extra extender. If this is the only usable card you draw, you can end with one draw and a bureibu.  Gama - this card makes bureibu a good interruption and is great for ladder. Also it is a Karakuri tuner  Barrel - This is a Karakuri tuner and its level is useful for laddering.  Bonze - this card is great to summon after you summon barrone. It lets you get two bureibus and a super shogun in addition to the barrone.  Watchdog - this is a level four tuner which can make a shogun with a mecha phantom beast token. Not the best to draw, but it’s only a half brick since its a Karakuri tuner.  Maxx C - You need to play this card. It’s a win button going first or second.  Ash - This card stops maxx c.  Crossout - This stops maxx c, Nibiru, called by the grave, and ash, all of which end your turn.  Called by the Grave - This stops most handtraps.  Nibiru - you play this card because of crossout but it is fine going second.  001 - This is a garnet. Necessary for aurodon combo  Extra Deck:  Burei - This card is exclusively here for laddering into your end board cards, but it is very good at laddering.  Steel Shogun - Great for laddering and okay on an end board.  Super Shogun - Banishing your opponents cards are good. With gama you, it’s a quick effect. Usually you end with 2.  Barrone - This is the card you usually end on with your two Super shoguns. Omni negates are good.  Borreload Savage - This a backup barrone. Still very good. You don’t need both.

Battle Phase use Prime's effect to make it 5600, detach Afterglow for 11200 ATK or more. Your hand should hold all the tools you need to get both dragons onto the field and then some, with all the draws, searches, and special summons.  This deck can also go into a normal strategy if there isn't an opportunity to hit, or if both of your Prime Dragons have died.  I recommend swapping out 2 Accellight and the Photon Vanisher for any of the staples you need, if you need them."
