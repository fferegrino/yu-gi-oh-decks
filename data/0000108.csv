The group of archetypes consisting of ""Fluffals"", ""Edge Imps"" and ""Frightfurs"" work in unison to create a strong, consistent and OTK-able Fusion deck with various combos and approaches regarding gameplay, and its overall interactivity explains why the deck is so widely popular.</p> <p>The Main Deck is all about fetching the right cards to allow for multiple Fusion summons and to build a board that can clear the way and go for the face. To reach such a goal, we have a number of solid cards to work with. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>"" is one of your various searchers and fetches other ""Fluffals"" and ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"" upon being summoned from the hand, which can be easily combined with ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"", which allows for the Special Summon of another ""Fluffal"" from the hand. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" is also very useful as Fusion material, since it allows you to draw two cards and discard one when used for a Fusion, which is a definite plus and potential setup depending on what you discarded. ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a>"" is a searchable searcher for ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" as well as having a Fusion effect on it own, while ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a>"" can reuse ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" when it is used as Fusion material. Both ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a>"" are only at one, since they are searchable and not really necessary at higher numbers. I also added one copy of ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Angel"">Fluffal Angel</a>"" for testing purposes, which mostly comes into play as a Spell card that can revive monsters, but is more searchable than other options the deck would have at its disposal (with ""<a data-name=""Suture Rebirth"">Suture Rebirth</a>"" being unsearchable and ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Reborn"">Frightfur Reborn</a>"" only being able to revive the wrong cards most of the time; both of those are not in the deck for said reasons).</p> <p>One cannot talk about ""Fluffals"" without mentioning ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"". This card does pretty much everything, from card draw and searches to setup and summoning. For this reason, there are also a few cards in the deck that can interact with the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"": ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a>"" can be discarded to search for them, ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>"" can fetch them back from the graveyard while also having a very useful ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" effect alongside that and ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>"" can destroy it for a draw two effect with an added search, meaning a major plus in card economy.</p> <p>On the ""Edge Imp"" side of things, I am running one copy of ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"", since it is easily searchable via the plethora of effects at your disposal while also featuring its own revive effect (which can also be used to setup ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>'s"" summon effect), ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>"" is at three since it searches for cards and the newer ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a>"" is also featured at three copies for the ability of Fusion summoning monsters as a Quick Effect during the opposing turn without the need of using a Fusion Spell.</p> <p>The Spell line-up is pretty standard for a ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" deck: Three ""<a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>"" are absolutely paramount since you will Fusion summon a lot and can search for it in your own archetype, three ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"" are there for all manner of effects and interactions, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>"" for being a straight +1 as a searcher, three ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"" mainly to send ""<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>"" directly to the graveyard to trigger its search effect and both one copy of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a>"" for ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a>"" shenanigans and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>"" mostly for the secondary effect that allows you to summon additional monsters from the hand. The last three slots I filled with one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" to ditch either ""<a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" for easy backrow removal and to possibility to destroy my own ""Toy Vendor"" alongside some opposing backrow to profit from the search and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>"" to go into ""<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>"", which not only is a nice fit for a ""Frightfur"" deck due to its effects but also gets rid of opposing monsters in the process. These last three choices are absolutely debatable, but I tend to keep my decks fairly budget-friendly and the copies of ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>"" that are currently found in other ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" decks are fairly expensive.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is also pretty straightforward: ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a>"" is all the rage right now, and for good reason since it offers destruction, setup and ATK boosts in one fell swoop. ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>"" allows for non-destruction removal and multiple attacks, ""<a data-name=""Dangerous Frightfur Nightmary"">Dangerous Frightfur Nightmary</a>"" can grow into a sizeable beater while bringing her own setup and protection, ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>"" clears the way and buffs your monsters while ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a>"" potentially attacks for 5+ times; ""<a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a>"" is probably the least useful member, but has its merit in certain matchups. On the more generic side, I run one ""<a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>"" (easily summonable via ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" and the added summon of a ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>"") to summon ""<a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>"" and steal opposing cards. The ""<a data-name=""Cross Sheep"">Cross Sheep</a>"" is there for even more insanity with the right board, since it allows for the resummon of ""<a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>"" or other monsters which can use their effects multiple times per turn if they leave the field in some way.</p> <p>My list is actually pretty similar to various other ""Fluffal""/""Frightfur"" lists, but after reading through the archetype you will automatically find certain ratios and cards to be desireable, which is why so many people come up with similar lists and results when it comes to ""Fluffals"" and ""Frightfurs"".</p> <p>If you want to know more about the archetype in general and maybe take a look at an analysis that features all the cards the three archetypes have on offer, feel free to visit my archetype analysis for ""Fluffals"", ""Edge Imps"" and ""Frightfurs"" on my blog under this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/archetype-analysis-fluffal-edge-imp-frightfur/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/archetype-analysis-fluffal-edge-imp-frightfur/</a>.</p>"

The objective is to summon Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord. The easiest way is to get the spell card Cubic Karma into the graveyard. This can be done in a few ways, but Summoner Monk, Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel, and Foolish Burial Goods will be the main ways. I prefer going second with this deck, so that you can draw that first card and optimize your chance of being able to summon Crimson Nova, and to make use of things like Lightning Storm (and Evenly Match, but I put that in the Side Deck).  Every Cubic spell and trap has a graveyard effect, so using cards like Twin Twisters, Karma Cut, and Darkword Dealings to send any spell/trap cards you have in your hand to the grave is usually the best move. <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Summoner Monk, activate his effect, discard any other spell from your hand (if you can discard Cubic Karma even better), to Special Summon Duza, the Meteor Cubic Vessel from your deck, then use Duza's  ability to send Cubic Karma from your deck to your graveyard. Banish Cubic Karma from your graveyard to add a cubic monster from your deck to your hand - Crimson Nova. Cubic Karma is not once per turn, so if you get multiple in the grave, even better, start stacking your hand.</li>  	<li>Crimson Nova can be special summoned by revealing any 3 cubic cards from your hand, as long as they have different names.</li>  	<li>Once Crimson Nova's on the field, you should be able to OTK pretty easily. If Crimson Nova destroys a monster, he's allowed to make a second attack, and you can double his attack with Cubic Wave (as long as your opponent has a face up monster). This ATK increase is permanent too, if you don't OTK.</li>  	<li>You only need to hit your opponent with 5000 damage too, from there, Crimson Nova's ability with cause the OTK. If you get the the End Phase, Crimson Nova's ability triggers, and each player loses 3000 LP. Performapal Rain Goat protects you from taking damage if you have him in your hand though (just watch for hand traps like Called by the Grave).</li> </ul> Vijam is a great wall in a pinch, too, since he can't be destroyed by battle, if you need an extra turn to set up your hand.  I know Geira Guile, Blade Garoodia, and Buster Gundil are bricks and aren't ideal, but from my play testing, I have never really had an issue with them. You can always swap in any three other cards; but I would still pick Cubic cards if you do, because you really want as many Cubic cards as possible for the best chance to summon Crimson Nova. This deck is obviously not meta in any way, and sometimes it's fun to play it different ways. It's not optimal, but getting out Buster Gundil once and while and having him attack 3 times with 3000 ATK is fun.  In this deck, you're always looking for ways to burn your opponent (Crimson Nova's effect mainly), but Geira Guile, Gagaga Cowboy, Gustav Max, and Blackship of Corn are all there to help boost that burn damage for an OTK.  Not my best or most efficient deck, but it's one of my favorites to play. You can use combinations of Cubic Karma and Cubic Wave to get Crimson Nova's ATK to crazy numbers. Cubic Waves can stack too, so you can double his ATK multiple times. I've even gotten Crimson Nova over 21,000 ATK once or twice.  &nbsp;  Other Options: I've also seen some builds with Monster Gate and Magical Hats to get as many spells/traps into the grave as well; I've tried those, but I didn't prefer them. I've also tried some Barrel Behind the Door builds where you send Crimson Nova's effect damage that you receive back at your opponent, but it wasn't very consistent. There's lots of room to explore."

The board goal to end on is spirit dragon, seals, triple burst(can be subbed out for borrelsword) and either hope harbinger or photon lord. A really good hand will get all of those on the field. Using seals to bounce a card and summon amorphage goliath is crucial. You can use heart earth dragon with draglubion if you're confident he won't get popped. Photon dragon is here for photon lord to yoink out of the deck on the next turn. Getting off noctovision and chaos space in the same turn is insane since nocto is a free special summon and both of them have an effect to let you draw a card."

Instead, use the other monsters in the hand to keep your monsters on the board alive.

This is still a control deck though and can make set 5 and pass!,"So for this new deck im playing spellbooks but with a mythical beast engine. Unfortuntely there is not much i can talk about this new deck as its a control deck so i will tell what decks I am working on instead. This deck has 65% winrate but i found almost impossible to get something higher than that.  Coming Soon:  Thunder Dragoon Chaos - Thunder Dragons, Red-eyes Dragoon, Chaos all mixed into 1 deck  Dragoon Spyral - Personally i think Spyral actually works with dragoon now so i'll be trying to build that  Volcanics - This deck is consistent at producing interruptions and even scattershots  chain block the raigeki!  Isolde/Paleo Orcust - A deck which is is 100% a more consistent verison of orcust. both of which is eiser to combo off.  &nbsp;  Cards i play and why:  Ill try to keep this short but there is a few cards i wanted to go over.  Mythical Beast Engine - Master Cerberus is a card which is really hard to deal with and jackal can bring out jackal king which is a negate  Dogmatika Punishment - Pop 2 with it send n'tss and then u can pop another one  Spellbook Engine - More interuptions more draw power more removal.  Extra is important i do go into crowley, selene accesscdoe a lot. Nova and Mechaba is for dogmatika matchups.  Hopefully u enjoy the deck and be free to send any feedback."

What you want to do is get Exodius out with Spirit Barrier on the field and Safe Zone equipped to him. At that point, Exodius is protected from nearly everything and you don't have to worry about taking damage. All you have to do is attack any of the opponent's monsters five times.

I haven't been doing that in a while, and that's my favorite deck. So I made this deck profile, aptly named ""UCT Is MVP!"" Anyone who says Ultimate Conductor Tyranno isn't one of the most broken boss monsters in Yu-Gi-Oh is either a liar or an idiot.  &nbsp;  Now, this deck is meant to go second, but if going first, it can potentially set up a nice board consisting of Ultimate Conductor Tyranno and Evolzar Dollka/Laggia--maybe you'll also get a hand trap or two. Jurrac Aeolo is in here because as a Tuner you can summon with Babycerasaurus, it makes a great extender to link climb into Needlefiber, Selene, and Accesscode Talker. And if Accesscode Talker and UCT isn't enough to OTK the opponent, the Extra Deck also has Borrelsword Dragon."

While certainly not Meta worthy, I hope it may be able to compete in that area, as I've put qite a lot of thought and research into this deck.  Basically, if you have the ability to, you want to get out Shaman of the Tenyi with Mare Mare in the grave so that you can get Sahasrara with Mare and a Mini-Mare. If you go second, you can get a Spirit Token, and therefore a Berserker by way of Linkuriboh, ending up with 2 monsters with 3000 ATK. Mystic Mine is in there to stall, and Cynet Storm is there, 'cause a) why not? and b) works with Set Rotation. Notice some cards can be bricks... hence the Side Deck. Note also that if you incorporate some of the Side Deck, you can get White Aura Bihumat (on your opponent's turn, no less). Here's how:  Step 1: Get Halqifibrax (should be easy enough)  Step 2: Use it's effect and get Jet Synchron and use to get Linkuriboh  Step 3: Summon Jet from the Grave, use Linkuriboh and Jet to get Dagda  Step 4: Use Dagda to set Scythe  Step 5: On opponent's turn, banish Halqifibrax for Wonder Magician  Step 6: Destroy Scythe using Wonder Magician's effect, then use Scythe and Wonder Magician to get Bihamut  Congradulations! Your mind has been broken (btw this was taken from a somewhat popular article by baMMax. Giving credit where it's due)."

Having Archlord Kristya is big for stopping summons  and other plays by your opponent. If you have tri-wight you can use it to pure light and get more fairies in hand at the cost of not being able to play Kristya. The side deck is for being more competitive I just wanted to have fun. Btw quick not rotated out a tri-wight up to you it helps with Nibiru again up to you.
