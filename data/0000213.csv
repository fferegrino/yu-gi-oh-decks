It has been a top-tier presence in the meta more or less consistently since mid-2020, and continues to adapt despite several banlist hits.

But only when you have completed the Extra Link!!! Next, put Giant Ogre the the left on Destroy. This in turn, will let you put Solid to the left of Giant, and then you can use Solid to get Blade onto the next EMZ and Powerload to the left of Solid.

The answer is mixed. The grind game is better, and the interruptions get real, but you hit Winda less consistently and while the ceiling is high the floor is very low. I think Pure or Invoked Shaddolls is probably better than this. Too bad, I was hoping I'd jive with these boss monsters, since they are Fiends, But I'm not sure this is better than just consistently making Winda, or even making Mechaba + Ecclesia with a chance to Winda. One nice thing about the deck is it doesn't care about Zombie World. Like at all. So, we're free to run the best floodgate in the format without the risk of blowing ourselves out.  So, for the Despia engine, I have 3 Aluber, 3 Tragedy, 1 Dramaturge, 1 Despia Theatre, and 3 Branded Opening. Aluber is your Stratos, and contributes to that great grind game and is a clear 3 of. I like 3 Tragedy because it helps consistently search my Despia cards, the grind effect on this is a little weak but it can set Branded Opening so that's useful. Dramaturge at 1 is fine, this is your big main deck boss monster, and represents a negate in a lot of situations as well, pretty good I'd say. For Shaddolls we have 2 Squamata, 1 Wendi, 1 Ariel, 3 each of the Fusions spells, and 1 each of the Traps. Small Package, the goal is actually to search these cards with Apkallone to make Shaddoll plays, but sometimes starting combos with Construct will be a better option than holding onto your Dogmatika card.  We run Super Poly, basically both archetypes are Super Poly archetypes, against Light and Dark monsters, Dark in particular, you can crack pretty hefty boards with absolute ease.  Dogmatika cards are cool, but oddly enough we're running 3 Nadir and basically 1 each of the cards it searches. That's it. A little sad, but this isn't an ecclesia deck, it just needs an easy way to send Apkallone for value.  Magicalized Fusion opens up Winda out of Verte Anaconda, which is cool and fun. Super cool and fun, super cool and fun. We run 2 Winda so we can back Winda up with Winda. I like Winda.  Droplets is Droplets, its just super good right now, and even though it sends for cost I think it is worth it. Solemn Strike is here because we need extra negates in the deck, and pretty badly.  The Side deck is little sloppy but overall I'm pretty happy with it. I probably won't work on this deck anymore, because I don't think I like this engine as much as Aleister or Magistus cards, even if they are Fiends."

By using the basic swarming and Special Summon material set-up of Magnet Warriors, the play extension and powerful abilities of Adamancipators and the brute force nature of Fossils, this deck is extremely versatile in terms of its aimed win conditions. (NOTE: This deck runs as little negation as possible, because 10 pounds of negation gets boring after some time.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Crazy Specific 1 Turn Lockdown Mode (ends board with Cross-Sheep [Extra Monster Zone], Knightmare Gryphon [Linked to Cross-Sheep in the zone below it], and Cyberse Quantum Dragon [next to Cross-Sheep's Link]): Special Summon Researcher with its own effect, then activate Sentry's effect in GY to Special Summon itself. Activate Magnetic Field and use its effect to bring back Beta The Electro from the GY. Beta's effect on summon adds a Level 4 manila Magnet Warrior. Activate Researcher's effect, and Special Summon either a manila Magnet Warrior among the excavated cards or a Gamma The Electro. If you summon Gamma, use its effect on summon to Special the added Level 4 manila. Use the Level 4 manila to Link Summon Link Spider. Activate Super Team Buddy Force and target Link Spider to Special Trisbaena from GY so that it is co-linked to Link Spider. You can then Normal Summon any 1 monster from your hand (most likely the manila added with Beta's effect if Researcher Summoned a manila instead of a Gamma). Use the Normal Summoned monster and Trisbaena to Link Summon Knightmare Gryphon,who should be co-linked to Link Spider. (You can activate its effect on Summon if you want, but it's not really important to the lockdown.) Next use Beta and Link Spider to Link Summon Cross-Sheep above Gryphon's Link. Then tune Sentry with Researcher to Synchro Summon Quantum next to both Cross-Sheep and Gryphon's Links (for assurance). Cross-Sheep's effect on Quantum's Summon, giving all of your monsters +700 ATK. This board limits your opponent's ability to attack or use certain card effects (since only Quantum can be targeted and can boot bigger monsters back to the hand), restricts your opponent's Special Summoned monster effects (thanks to Gryphon), and not to mention the fact that you get 2 main beaters with 3200 ATK each.</span>"

The idea is to spam Winda, back it with Mechaba, and abuse Nadir Servant to search your Shaddoll cards. The deck is a pile of broken spells and small engines.  For Shaddoll monsters, it is a small package, but not tiny, 3 each of the Squamata and Wendi, and 1 Ariel. You want to open Squamata or Wendi as often as possible to make the fusion spells live, and you need the 1 Ariel for the combos. It is also an incredible interruption. These are searchable off of Nadir Servant funnily enough. 3 of each of the Fusion spells, because we're a fusion deck and need to see fusion spells for the combos. They are both very good fusion spells. 1 of each trap because I wanted to keep the package just to essential cards.  3 Nadir Servant, 1 Ecclesia, 1 Fleurdelis. You don't usually summon Ecclesia, this is a generic Shaddoll searcher that also provides a Light monster for material. When you do summon Ecclesia she remains good. 1 of the Trap seems fine, you don't actually want to be locked out of follow-ups too often in your fusion deck.  1 Terraforming, 3 Meltdown, 3 Aleister, 2 Invocation. This helps give the deck another prong of attack in access to Invoked monsters and access to a good generic Fusion spell for making Shaddolls.  1 Magicalized Fusion, this is usually how you make your first Winda off Verte Anaconda. Guaranteed Windas are nice.  3 Super Poly. We're a little light on targets, but we're a Shaddoll deck, and this helps us make Shaddolls plays using monsters as materials at ""Spell Speed 4"".  3 Droplets. Should just be a steple right now if you want to play the game.  3 Secret Village of the Spellcasters. We play maindeck Spellcaster engines to get our cards back online, and we make Winda on our end board, so this is the first spicy floodgate we play.  In the Extra deck 2 Construct. You just need 1 for your turn 1 plays, we aren't a comboish version of the deck, we're trying to reliably make Winda a couple of times and Mechaba once. 2nd is for follow-up. 2 Winda, again I think this is needed for the grind game. 1 Apkallone, this is a negate to back up your plays sometimes, and a tool to send with Nadir Servant other times. 1 Titaniklad, this could come up in some hands but it isn't what we're playing Nadir for. 1 Nt'ss, this is to make the Trap card live. Starving Venom so Super Poly can break boards pretty well using your opponent's monsters. 1 of each Mechaba and Purgatrio. The best Invoked monsters, 1 for going first one for going second. For links we have 1 Artemis and 1 Almiraj. Artemis is important for turning Aleister into a LIGHT monster for Shaddoll plays but also makes him a low-end as a 1 card Mechaba you can run 7 of, and Almiraj means he just as easily accesses Purgatrio. Gravity Controller helps with your Construct combos that make guaranteed Windas. Cross-Sheep could come up in the grind game and be really useful there. Verte Anaconda is really insane in this deck, and necessary for certain opens into Winda 1.  For the side I started with Zombie World. In some matchups this will be better than Secret Village, even if it is worse in most, but it is relatively free in the deck, only impacting access to the Magistus Link 1, and having access to 2 broken floodgates for whichever is better in a matchup seems good. You could even run both going first against Dry, effectively 6 cards that shut down the ritual spell. I initially had the Solemns in the main deck, but I think they're a better side deck plan for this deck than a lot of the better options. We really lack negation, and being able to negate summons and effects could be a really important generic thing to do in matchups where our floodgates aren't effective. Then I threw in Droll and Lancea, high impact hand traps that are specifically good against the best 2 decks and gives us 6 cards to bring in in those respective matchups. Lancea is also good against Virtual World, which is probably the third best deck, and our floodgates are good against Dragon Link."

There are also two field Spells, each representing one state of the dream.</span>  <span>Every Dream Mirror monster (of these three) has the gimmick to tribute itself to summon their opposite form, if the opposite Field Spell is in a field zone (including your opponents). So if I control <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite</a></span> and a <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Terror"">Dream Mirror of Terror</a></span> I can then tribute Ikelos to summon <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara"">Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara</a></span> from deck. This can be done during either player's Main or Battle Phase.</span>  <span>Each of them has an effect that triggers if they are summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster. <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Sprite"">Sprite</a></span> searches any Dream Mirror card, <span><a data-name=""Ikelos, the Dream Mirror Mara"">Mara</a></span> Special Summons from hand, <span><a data-name=""Phantasos, the Dream Mirror Friend"">Friend</a> </span>Special Summons a Dream Mirror from the GY, <span><a data-name=""Phantasos, the Dream Mirror Foe"">Foe</a> </span>attack directly, <span><a data-name=""Morpheus, the Dream Mirror White Knight"">White Knight</a></span> protects itself and <span><a data-name=""Morpheus, the Dream Mirror Black Knight"">Black Knight</a></span> destroys a card.</span>  <span>Both Field Spells, <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Terror"">Dream Mirror of Terror</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Joy"">Dream Mirror of Joy</a></span> have minor effects, they are most needed for their names. Both of these have an effect that allows you to banish them during the End Phase to activate the opposite one directly from hand or deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Their strategy:</span>  <span>The plan was usually to gain good advantage by swapping out your monsters during both player's turns. Sprite searches a monster which Mara Special Summons from hand. Usually a Friend that Special Summons from GY or a Black Knight to destroys a card. That way you could mass advantage while keeping disrupting your opponent (a little).</span>  <span>Since you need both Field Spells to enable all of your monsters you would make use of <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Hypnagogia"">Dream Mirror Hypnagogia</a></span>. This would activate the Field Spells on both players fields, allowing every monster to use both their swap and their summon effect during either players turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Their fatal flaw:</span>  <span>This is were we transition from a joyous dream of card advantage a to frightful nightmare of bricking. The only way to search Hypnagogia is through Sprite but Sprite doesn't trigger unless it is summoned by a Dream Mirror monster's effect. But you can't use their effects if you don't control the corresponding Field Spell. How's the Field Spell searched? Sprite but Sprite doesn't trigger unless - you see what I'm getting at?</span>  <span>You need both a Field Spell and access to your monsters in order to start playing the game. You have the bare minimum in</span> <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Phantasms"">Dream Mirror Phantasms</a></span><span>, which searches you a monster. Between that and</span> <span><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a></span> <span>you had little means to access Sprite, which required Mara on Field and Dream Mirror of Joy in the Field Zone. And that's only what it takes to get to the cards to get your engine going. You then need to use their effects again to add, summon and do all the good stuff. There was no single card that did it all. You would brick a lot and then - obviously - would lose to any interruption. Oh and the Fusion Spell to summon your Boss Monster doesn't have Fusion in it's name either, which is fun. So you have a whole lot of cards you need to search off a single card and only little means to access that single card's effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Enter Sandmann 2021:</span>  <span>BLVO came around and out of nowhere Konami decided to print legacy support for Dream Mirror. Like with every protagonist, their power spike is preceded by a Flashback. So they printed the baby version of their Boss monster and printed a new Boss monster altogether.</span>  <span>The new addition to the main deck, <span><a data-name=""Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Disciple"">Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Disciple</a></span> could special summon itself, which was fine but didn't really address any of the issues the deck was facing.</span>  <span>Sounds like they scrapped their archetypes theme but it's fantastically thematic. The old boss monster, <span><a data-name=""Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Erlking"">Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Erlking</a></span> was a LIGHT so they printed <span><a data-name=""Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor"">Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor</a></span> who is a DARK, keeping the archetype not only on theme but completing them by giving every monster an opposite typing, but one...</span>  <span>---until now. It's the year 2021. It is October 7th and new legacy support is announced. The last remain Dream Mirror, the DARK version of our Boss Baby has finally been revealed and oh. my.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Am I dreaming?</span></span>  <span>This card is pretty much everything this deck desperately needed. <span><a data-name=""Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Heretic"">Neiroy, the Dream Mirror Heretic</a></span> would on summon (yes, even on a simple Normal Summon, finally) search it's opposite, Disciple. Disciple's extend all of a sudden matters as Heretic can tribute another Dream Mirror (the Disciple) to not only Special Summon ANY Dream Mirror monster from your deck but also add the Field Spell necessary for its effect. This allows for a spicy new combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Time to make Verte:</span></span>  <span>This is the new combo:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Summon Heretic, add Disciple. Special Disciple</span></li>  	<li><span>Heretic tributes Disciple to summon Sprite and adds Terror. Activate Terror.</span></li>  	<li><span>Sprite, since it was Special Summoned by the effect of a Dream Mirror monster now searchs</span> <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror of Chaos"">Dream Mirror of Chaos</a></span> <span>(The Fusion Spell)</span></li>  	<li><span>Link both off them away for Verte / Link Heretic off for Almiraj (if you play Accesscode this is another Attribute in the GY)</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Chaos, banish both Neiroy from the GY to Fusion Summon Oneiros, the Dream Mirror Tormentor, which means a Monster effect negate on 5th summon so this combo is <strong>Nibiru-proof</strong></span></li>  	<li><span>(Link Almiraj and Sprite into Verte, then) Activate Verte to summon <span><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</a></span></span></li> </ol> <span>This is a monster effect negate, a targeted card destruction and two 3k ATK beaters on the field off a single card. It's not game breaking but it's actual modern Yu-Gi-Oh. In a Dream Mirror deck. Incredible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>What else?</span>  <span>This is the combo off a single card. But if you open with a Dream Mirror monster besides Mara you can also use Sprite's other effect to summon Mara who will then summon the Dream Mirror monster from hand. Friend could then Special Summon another one from the GY. White Knight would equal another pop during your opponent's turn. If you open Hypnagogia or Chaos you can search the other to have both Field Spells live making your Dream Mirrors actually gain you advantage, too. Having Joy on the field also means that you can change from Tormentor into Erlking for another pop if you tribute another Dream Mirror monster. <span><a data-name=""Dream Mirror Oneiromancy"">Dream Mirror Oneiromancy</a></span> is another sweet pick-up off of Sprite if you open Chaos. It's a Spell/Trap or Special Summon negate. If you open with <span><a data-name=""Destiny Fusion"">Destiny Fusion</a></span> you can end on <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span> to make Apollousa during your opponent's turn. Depending on how you opened with you Dream Mirrors you might even be able to go into <span><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.</a></span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>What's next?</span>  <span>I dunno. I'm sure many cards in this deck will still change. Heretic completely changes how the deck plays (Not including <span><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a></span> in Dream Mirror used to label <em>you</em> a heretic). Ratios need to be figured out. Maybe some names will be cut completely. There a few more Dream Mirror cards I haven't even included in the deck. This is but a first step in the right direction, a peek of what's to come. Maybe you wanna keep the ED simple and play Prosperity or Extravagance. Maybe you wanna lean into a r10nk OTK or play only Neiroy and Ikelos and play a bunch of handtraps. I don't know. And I love that I don't. This is gonna be interesting.</span>  <span>So here you go: I welcome you to the world of Dream Mirror.</span>"

(note: if you draw Forgotten Ruin, it's okay. It's still an ""Umi"" card but you don't benefit from that card for synchro and xyz summon. Its effect is the same with Sea Stealth Attack but SSA is much better because it protects the backrow against spell/trap destruction cards.)</span></li>  	<li><span>Set the other monster you drew to activate Penguin Champ's effect in which it summons itself to the field and you have an option to reduce its level. After it was special summon, activate Penguin Champ's effect of flipping the monster you set face-up. (note: If your set monster is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Puny Penguin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Puny Penguin</strong></a>, you have an option to not adjust its level using Magellanica to summon <strong><a data-name=""Penguin Brave"">Penguin Brave</a></strong> or adjust its level by 2 to summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;White Aura Whale&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>White Aura Whale</strong></a>.)</span></li>  	<li><span>During your opponent's turn, if he/she activates <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Twin Twister&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Twin Twister</strong></a> or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Lightning Storm</strong></a>, activate SSA's effect to temporarily banish your synchro monster and protect your backrow. You also take no damage from direct attacks because of Tornado Wall. After that, your synchro monster returns to the field during the End Phase of your opponent's turn. You can also use SSA to save your monsters from card effects.</span></li>  	<li><span>During your 2nd turn, once your synchro monster is on the field, you can attack twice if your synchro monster is WAW or attack once using <strong>Penguin Brave</strong>. (note: 1) If you draw <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Penguin Sword&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Penguin Sword</strong></a> and the monster set by your P. Brave's effect was <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Nopenguin&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Nopenguin</strong></a>, flip <strong>Nopenguin</strong> before <strong>Penguin Brave</strong> attacks so that it would trigger <strong>Nopenguins</strong> effect that every time a penguin monster activate its effect of returning a card on hand, instead of going to the opponent's hand, it is remove from play. 2) If you draw <strong><a data-name=""Glacial Beast Polar Penguin"">Glacial Beast Polar Penguin</a></strong> this turn and <strong>Penguin Brave</strong> which you summon on your first turn set a monster on the field, flip the set monster to synchro summon either WAW or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Graydle Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Graydle Dragon</strong></a>.)</span></li>  	<li><span>The main deck have a lot of protection traps like Solemns, Aegis and Ice Dragon's Prison. (note: if your opponent uses Dragoon, bait him first by using any card effect so that he/she will use its once per turn negation effect then if you have a set <strong><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a></strong>, activate it to banish 2 of his/her monsters including his/her Dragoon. If he/she is relying on the Predaplant Verte Anaconda to summon Dragoon, just negate its summoning or activation using Solemns.)</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong><em>Update 10/10/21</em></strong>: To stop your opponent from summoning any OP cards like Dragoon, Zeus or Galaxy-Eyes Dragons, you need to have SSA, Tornado Wall and Magellanica/Forgotten Ruin face-up on the field and summon Barrier Statue of the Torrent. This stops your opponent from special summoning any OP monsters. If you're unlucky and your opponent summoned an OP monster, you can special summon 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</strong></a> on your opponent's field by tributing their OP monster.</span></li>  	<li><span>To lock them out from special summoning any non-WATER attribute monster, normal summon <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Barrier Statue of the Torrent&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Barrier Statue of the Torrent</strong></a> then tribute the OP monster your opponent have to special summon Gameciel. Every time your opponent attacks using Gameciel, you can use SSA's effect to temporarily banish your Barrier. You're opponent will not attack because of Tornado Wall because even your opponent attacks, you take no battle damage. Gameciel is also good if somehow your opponent uses Jinzo</span></li>  	<li><span>I removed 2 Guard Penguins and replaced it with 2 Twin Twisters from the side deck in case your opponent uses Skill Drain, Royal Decree and other negate and limiting cards.</span></li>  	<li><span>I removed 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Solemn Strike&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Solemn Strike</strong></a> from the main deck and replaced it with 1 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Solemn Judgment&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Solemn Judgment</strong></a> to negate decks using Imperial Order.</span></li>  	<li><span><em><strong>Update 11/06/2021: </strong></em>I replaced 2 <strong>Spear Cretin</strong> and 1 <strong>Morphing Jar #2</strong> with 2 <strong>Penguin Sword</strong> and 1 <strong>Magellanica</strong> in the side deck while the two latter cards from the main deck is replaced with 2 Aquaactress continuous spell cards: <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aquarium Stage&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aquarium Stage</strong></a> which makes all WATER monsters indestructible by battle, and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aquarium Set&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aquarium Set</strong></a> which increase the attack of all WATER monsters by 300. Also, either of the 2 Aquaactress spell cards are destroyed, you can special summon 1 Aqua monster from the GY to the field.

Get this into your hand ASAP.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Gravitino"">S-Force Gravitino</a> ; Great on-field effect and searches any S-Force card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Pla-tina"">S-Force Pla-tina</a> ; Pla-tina summoning a banished Gravitino is your main turn 1 combo.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Edge Razor"">S-Force Edge Razor</a> ; Situationally useful field effect (Tri-Brigade Revolt...). Also helps with less than ideal opening hands where you have too many higher level S-Forces in hand. This is your main good way of getting enough materials for Justify... but is unfortunately Cyberse so Justify's unavailable with this under TCBOO.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Orrafist"">S-Force Orrafist</a> ; An extra piece of interaction that might be useful. Usually for if/when Chiyomaru resolves on my opponent's turn. Same Cyberse problem as above.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Dog Tag"">S-Force Dog Tag</a> ; Helps set up another aligning column. Mainly a Gravitino target for when you already have Chase in hand.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Chase"">S-Force Chase</a> ; Your main piece of interaction. This is usually what you search with Gravitino.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nemeses Flag"">Nemeses Flag</a> ; Extra material to help summon Justify when you need it - or Eschatos. Return effect is also very useful for more drawn out games (acts a third Platina)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Archnemeses Eschatos"">Archnemeses Eschatos</a> ; Your main followup play - board wipe + lockdown against some decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""S-Force Justify"">S-Force Justify</a> ; Your other followup option. A monster negate and very good at cleaning boards.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> ; Gets monsters banished for Pla-tina and Flag. Possibly annoying your opponent is a nice bonus :)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> ; Strong floodgate card. You can play under this pretty much unhindered since all your monsters are different types (except Orrafist/Razor/Justify T_T)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> ; Another strong floodgate.</li>  	<li>The Extra Deck ; General utility cards and accesscode/topologics for finishers. If TCBOO is on the field and you need to summon a card that's already on the field - <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> could be good options that solve other problems too. Other than that - there's Dogmatika Maximus hate, Cyber Dragon hate and <a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a> targets for when your opponent is too eager to destroy your backrow.</li> </ul> <strong>The Strategy.</strong> <ol>  	<li>You want to go first. The ideal opening hand has Chiyomaru and Gravitino. Summon Chiyomaru -&gt; Banish Gravitino -&gt; Summon Platina -&gt; Revive Gravitino -&gt; Search Chase.</li>  	<li>If you Chiyomaru, Gravitino and Platina in hand: You can summon Edge Razor from Chiyomaru to summon Platina from hand instead. This gives you one more monster, one more Chase bounce, one more field column effect.</li>  	<li>If you have the above combos and a Chase already in hand, you usually search Bridgehead or Dog Tag depending on whether or not Bridgehead is already activated. Dog Tag gives an extra column aligner/body for Chase bounce. Bridgehead could search Dog Tag or be used next turn if already activated this turn for followup.</li>  	<li>When everything goes wrong and Chiyomaru gets negated: Try to use Chiyomaru on your opponent's turn to either align Gravitino with an important monster to break their combo or summon Orrafist to maybe destroy 1 monster.</li>  	<li>If you manage to survive your opponent's turn: Justify or Eschatos might swing the game back in your favour. Justify requiring exactly 3 materials can be difficult - usually a mix of Edge Razor, Platina, Flag are needed.

Running an interaction suite which is better defensively, and fewer floodgates, and well as less confliction with D. Shifter.  So, I'm on all 6 pots. Flunders doesn't really special summon, doesn't use the extra deck as a result, and only draws a few cards. You're also highly reliant on seeing Robina or Map + Flunder. Digging deeper into the deck just improves consistency a lot. I think you should be running at least 5 of these, they don't even conflict. I'd avoid adding Extravagence into the mix, and I think it is worse than Prosperity in this deck, because you need to see such specific starter cards to get your game on. I'm trying 1 Gold Sarc, which helps you chain block and subs in for the field spell in some but not all of your combos. Then Terraforming and all 3 of the field spell. This version is built around being able to play an Earthbound Immortal card, so you need the field spell, and it also creates a bunch of two card combos, so I think it is actually a fine consistency card in its own right. Unknown Wind is actually a grind game card. Being able to tribute an opponent's cards, including spells and traps, is pretty huge, and so is the ability to put 2 random Flunders back into your deck to draw 2.  For Flunder monsters, the package is getting larger. 3 Robina is obligatory, it is 1 card combo. 3 Eaglen makes a lot of sense, since this way we are running 8 Flunder names for Map and Gold Sarc to start your plays, and Eaglen is the second to best Flunder. 1 of each Toccan and Strich. Both are needed for the Rasca combo that hand loops the opponent for 3, one represents some extra disruption, the other drastically improves your grind game. We also run 1 of the trap. The trap is bomb, but you search it with the combo and reset it with either Raiza or Toccan, so you can recycle a single copy of the trap turn after turn with Razia and Rasca.  For boss monsters, Empen is a decent flood gate and our main beat stick, and also searches out cards, usually the field spell or the trap. Raiza is a great piece of disruption that has the valuable upside of resetting cards from your GY to the top of your deck. Rasca hand loops opponents, usually for 2 on your turn 2 or occasionally for 3 on the opponent's turn 1 going first, and also recycles the Raiza by shuffling it back into the deck for later use.  5 floodgates are good enough, to avoid them conflicting too much. These are cards that can just randomly win you games when your combo gets disrupted effectively. Lose 1 Turn is pretty amazing, a 1 turn Skill Drain for Special Summoned monster which our deck doesn't make anyways that can buy you a lot of time. I cut Skill Drain, it conflicts with the deck's gameplan too much to be truly effective, you never wanted to flip it up until you were losing anyways. Imperial Order, on the other hand, is the tits, for sure makes the cut. Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure can conflict a little bit, but will generally hit opposing cards much higher and are mostly free, and hit other decks really hard. Dimension Shifter is the other 3 copies of this style effect, on a hand trap. You can reset it with Raiza, so it is basically Macro Cosmos if you see it. Book of Moon is already a great offensive card, but in this deck is also doubles as a defensive card, since you can chain block with banished Flunders to screw Ash and book your Eaglen to protect from Imperm and Veiler, and you don't really lose to other common hand traps. It is also run because it doesn't conflict with D Shifter. Imperm same shit different pile, weird that it is worse than Book of Moon in this deck but there it is.  Extra Deck is a Zeus package and then Prom Thrush. You shouldn't often need to go into the extra deck, but being able to make Zeus instead of your normal summons will sometimes come up so you may as well run it. The rest doesn't matter, Ultimate Falcon is a mascot, the Knightmares into Accesscode is an option for cleaning up and Shuraig is for the Dogmatika matchup, free search if they're bad and hit your extra deck.  <strong>Combos</strong>  <strong>Robina Combo</strong>  Normal Robina  Robina effect, add Eaglen, summon Eaglen  Eaglen effect, add Empen tribute summon Empen  Robina and/or Eaglen's effects chain block Empen. Add them to the hand.  Empen effect, add City of Dreams to your hand.  Now on your opponents turn you can continue the combo with City of Dreams, either making Raiza or Barrier Statue. Raiza can even pick up the Trap if it is banished. If you already have the Eaglen you can add the Barrier Statue and summon it out with the Empen on your turn. Same if you just see the Barrier Statue. If you see Raiza or the Empen you can use the second Empen to search the continuous spell before tributing it to the Raiza. On a good turn you can get the Barrier statue and a search / reset of the trap while removing 2 cards off of the Raiza. 3 if you already have the continuous spell.  Cut Called. It's a great card, but too redundant with the other banishing effects. In its place I'm running 1 Gold Sarc, which is effectively the Field Spell for most of your combos and lets you chain block.  <strong>Robina + Toccan combo</strong>  This one can also be done with Robina + Map, but I'm going to go through this one because this is the backwards way into the Earthbound Immortal card.  Normal Robina  Robina effect, add Eaglen, summon Eaglen  Eaglen effect, add Empen, tribute summon Empen  Empen cl1, Robina cl2, Eaglen cl3 recover Robina, add Map (DON'T SUMMON)  Play Map. Map effect, banish the trap, summon Toccan, grab the trap. Ending your turn on Empen + Toccan.  On your opponent's main phase, activate the trap.  Summon Robina, which grabs Strich, summons Strich which banishes a card (your own trap, for example) and summons Eaglen, which adds Earthbound Immortal. Earthbound Immortal tributes over Robina and Eaglen, adding them back to the hand while chainblocking its effect, shuffling itself and the lesser Flunders back into the deck to make your opponent randomly discard 3 cards. You also still have Empen. You more commonly see this play through map + Robina, which is mostly similar but you can use Toccan to loop the trap.  I like this version of the deck because it has so many ways to grind, with Rosca shuffling your monsters back into the deck, Toccan and Raiza resetting the trap for additional use, with the Raiza combo you can search out the spell to grind with Apex Avian, and you can afford to run high-powered floodgates to stall your opponent out even if your combos are interrupted. This also makes it a non-linear deck, in that the same 2 cards can result in multiple different end boards, Empen + 1 of your other plans. The Rosca combo is nice because it doesn't really incorporate any bricks - you have to play Toccan, Strich, and Map if you go for this combo, but most lists are playing these cards anyways, and the only real ""brick"" is the Rosca itself, and what drew me to the Rosca was that I wanted to run 1 more boss monster for the grind anyways. In some sophisticated board states Rosca even lets you reset the Raiza to use it again, the card is actually reasonably in the grind, plus I think on average if you have the choice of setting up Barrier Statue, searching a second time with Empen before hitting an opponent with Raiza, or hand looping them for 3, the hand loop option is probably the best of these. This is especially true if you have the continuous spell or search it because you have the trap, enabling you to make Rosca into a 3100 ATK beatstick that can attack directly while tributing an opponent's monsters and hand looping them for 3.  I think that the loop that you should usually be doing with Rasca isn't to hand loop them for 3 on their turn on the first turn cycles. I think you should be aiming the end on Empen + Barrier Statue, using Raiza to shut down their normal summon while resetting a card, then using Rasca to hand loop them for 2 on their turn to reset the Raiza. Used properly this strategy can theoretically grind for as many turns as your opponent has 2 cards in their hand, and it eats up their resources while resetting theirs. But you might be inclined, depending on the matchup, to favour Rasca opens if pure raw cards are a problem. There will be other matchups, usually Trap based decks, where Raiza plays are necessary anyway, so being able to use one copy of Raiza multiple times is pretty appealing.  &nbsp;  Cheat sheet for combos  Robina =  Empen + trap (Represents Raiza for disruption, Statue for a floodgate, or Apex Avian for a negate)  Robina + Map, OR Eaglen + Map, OR Toccan + Map, OR Robina + Eaglen, OR Robina + Toccan =  Empen + trap into hand loop  Robina + Eaglen, OR Robina + Map, OR Eaglen + Map, OR Robina + Barrier Statue =  Empen + Barrier statue + Trap  Robina + Raiza, OR Robina + Empen = Empen + Trap into Empen search into Raiza  &nbsp;  Ways to grind  Return Apex Avian into the hand, and use the continuous spell to put back whatever you need to search to get your game going while drawing cards.  Summ0n Barrier Statue, Raiza their normal summon to reset the trap, use Wiraqocha Rasca to rinse and repeat while hand looping them.  Use Toccan to loop back the trap and your Empens to always have a summon and a monster  Use Raiza to loop back D. Shifter to always have D. Shifter, use Toccan to loop back the trap  Just go through your bosses one by one as they are answered.  That's before we get to the games you auto-win with your floodgates."

First of all, i i'll explain Uka effects: the first is a passive burn of 300 that activate each time your enemy normal or special summon, which is not once per turn and can do tons of damage against decks like Code Talker and virtual world, but we all know what barrier statue does, so no combo for your opponent. the second effect is that it can special summon itself (from your hand) when a monster is special summoned from either main deck. The third and most important effect is that when Uka is normal/special summoned you can target a opponent monster and special summon from the deck a monster with the same atribute and atk equals to def, that will likely be a Barrier Statue.  Ok now you understand how the deck master work.  There's no consistent combo to summon some barrier statue in the first turn so i gonna explain what each archtype does.  Kaijus are the target for Uka.  Dogmatika can help you stall time and make a good Synergy too because Ecclesia Atk and Def are equal.  Barrier statue are just chilling  Most of the gizmeks is to search Uka but Orochi can also be used for XYZ summon.  If you got Ecclesia or Nadir Servant+ Interrupted Kaiju Slumber + Uka + in hand, you can:  Normal summon Ecclesia ~Ecclesia adds dogmatika Punishment ~activate Kaiju Slumber and summon two kaijus in each field(summon Gameciel in the enemy side) ~activate Uka second effect and summon it from your hand ~activate Uka third effect and target the kaiju to special summon a barrier statue ~set Dogmatika Punishment and end the turn.  You will can summon and search Uka in many different ways and there's alot of cards to stall so you won't gonna lose so fast.  The side deck have some cards i wanted to put but that are better in the side deck.  Any suggestions are welcome.  &nbsp;"

Need some advice to finish building it and making it more reliable.,"<h2><span>Short Summary</span></h2> <span>The deck is using mostly the Phantom Kight part of the engine for it's plays. I've added three Burinig Abyss main deck mosters for the Tour Guide, into Graff, into Cherubini combo: this makes you special summon Cir from the deck and then recycle Cherubini from the GY after the Bardiche summon. Your first objective is to summon Bardiche and if you have the material to turbo out one of the XYZ dragons depending on your needs. You can turbo them out, mainly, via two combos: the Rank-Up-Force magic card, or summoning two level 4 monsters (one is free using Rusty Bardiche's effect) and going into Raider's Knight.</span>  <span>The side deck revolves into stopping combos, clearing control decks board and as a last chance to trying and turbo out the infamous Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.</span> <h2><span>Why am I uploading it?</span></h2> <span>Simply I need some advice on how to make it more reliable. Right now i can feel that the deck is really consistent and has really not that much possible bricks, but also I know that needs something more to be really reliable and consistent. I hope to recive some advice to help me to finish building this really fun deck. Updated decklist: </span>"

It contains a little Charmer engine, to facilitate followup after you set up your first turn board and to increase the consistency of the deck.  <span><strong>Windwitches</strong></span>  I don't have too much to say about the Windwitches. They have a one card combo, ending on an indestructible <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>.  Except for <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a>, that enables said combo, <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> has a important role in this build, duo to its 1500 def and its ability to search for any Windwitch monster.  <span><strong>Charmer engine</strong></span>  The engine is build out of three cards: <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> and <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a>.  <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a> is a card played in many wind-based decks, thanks to its searching ability. It searches Windwitch - Ice Bell for the cost of discarding itself and another wind monster. It is also treated as a Charmer card, so it is searchable of off Spirit Charmers.  <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> is the heart of the engine. It effectively increases your ability to search for Windwitch - Ice Bell and on top of that sets up a play for turn three, by setting Possessed Partnerships to the field.  <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> allows you to special Windwitch - Glass Bell from grave. It is a searchable Back to the Front so to say. Special summoning Windwitch - Glass Bell during your opponent's end phase allows for Accescode plays or for level 8 and level 7 synchro plays during your turn, without being locked into wind monsters.  &nbsp;  The rest of the deck are just staples like crossout which help you to play through handraps or negate the activation of cards like Dark Ruler No More.  &nbsp;  I like the deck for all the tiny interactions between both the Chamers and the Witches.

The tournament was small and there weren’t a lot of people but I feel very proud of myself regardless.  Round one: mathmechs vs Dlink  So I matched into a Dlink player  Game one his entire opening was just HTs, I closed the game after negating a striker dragon and ending his turn  Game two I got clapped because I ran out of resources  Game three, went into time, I had much more lp so I got the W  Round two: mathmechs vs (maybe dogma?) invoked  Game one my opponent opts first and ns alister “search invo- “ I dropped my effect veiler so he just went into secure guardna pass, some shenanigans later he eventually got his turn again, draws, summons albaz fuses away my poor magma and gets titankind, attacks a clock spartoi and then I showed him his mistake, bullionblade was equipped and I milled devision and overpowered the titankind, next turn I set up and attack for game.  Game two, He opts first again, ns alister, I just drop another effect veiler, lol. My turn I do shenanigans but was hit by about 3 handtraps and decided to land on linkuriboh and magma. Ns albaz? What if… second effect veiler? I swear it alway gets into my hand, I final sigmaed him for game  Round 3: mathmechs vs Tri-Brigade  Game one I run into a billion handtraps but eventually get game when I realized he didn’t have summon to use  Game two a rescue cat took an effect veiler and then I attack for game with final sigma, it was an interesting game to say the least  But yeah, that was the tournament for me, I went 3-0 and got first place with mathmechs.  And that bought a question to mind for me: am I just that godly?"

Most of the Ghostrick traps are played at 1 copy mainly for the reason they will brick your hands and are only strong when you have established, however it shouldn't be an issue because almost all the xyz monsters for the Ghostrick archtype can get a Ghostrick card back when they are sent to the graveyard.  You can run mystic mine as a very strong option to control the board and allow you to set up your plays but it was not included in this deck list because I don't enjoy playing the card.  The side deck here is just to reflect cards that can be added instead of other cards in the main deck as they are all strong options."

You can do this combo in the first turn but you would need to have at least one monster to active Kaiju Slumber then proceed like normal. Normally you will not be able to use this in the first or second turn since kaiju Slumber is unsearchable, so the deck has a control layer that together with the kaijus helps to stall time.  The new card New Clear World is very good and indeed, can do a good par with Uka but not as good like Kaiju Slumber, because to use Clear Wolrd you would need at least 4 specific cards. Would be: Summon a kaiju using the enemy monster ~summon any monster in your field ~activate New World to bring any monster from the deck ~Special summon Uka ~with Uka summon a barrier statue. You not only can't do this in the fist turn but also have to do all of this while counting in not being negated and having a perfect hand, unlikely to ever happen. But ngl that new spell will be at 3 in many self-destructive decks and in these that uses alot of diferent types as Prank kids or Invoked.  In my last deck i explains Uka effects but feel free to read the card if you still don't know its potential.  Took off Dogmatika because i wanted to see how would the deck perform in 40 cards and discovered that is better this way.  I'll probably not update this deck anymore unless i found some broken shit since i think the deck is as it is now.  Go second.  &nbsp;  Almost forget! If you are against a water deck you lose! Since going against water means using the wind statue and giving to you opponent Gadarla that you can't beat :), and because you can't rely upon Luna which have only two copies. But if you are not playing singles you can in the second duel exchange Gameciel and water statue for Dogoran and a fire statue.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.

This deck is just for fun ONLY but I tried using this against Galaxy-Eyes OTK, True Light Blue-Eyes, and Drytron-Dragoon and somehow I won. Just lucky to have the right cards at the right time.  The main play of this deck is to have Final Countdown during the first draw and try to survive upto the 20th turn to win the duel. Also, this deck follows the current ban list so there's no Self-Destruct Button and Last Turn but you can modify it if you want to add those two in this deck. Lastly, you can modify it to have monster traps like Metal Reflect Slime, The First Monarch, and the Paleozoic archetype."

The deck can also play like normal HERO if the more gimmicky game plan fails.  I think this is a neat deck, not good per say, but neat."

The one card combo: Normal summon Deskbot 003 ~003 special summon a Deskbot 001 ~using these two link summon Crystron ~Crystron special summon another 001 ~link summon Auroradon ~Auroradon will summon his tokens ~after the token been summoned Chain the two Deskbot 001 effects and special summon them ~using one of the 001 and a token Syncro summon a Cupid Pitch and dont forget to rise its level ~syncro summon Borreload Savage Dragon usin Cupid Pitch plus one token ~Cupid effect will activate and add Plasma from your deck ~now activate Auroradon effect that tribute 2 to special summon Coltwing from the deck ~Coltwing summon more 2 tokens and deskbot 001 summon itself again ~using 001 and a token summon Herald of the Arc Light in defense position ~tribute 3 phantom beast to special summon Plasma from your hand. The final board shall have 2 negates and 1 skill drain in monster form (Plasma).  If you use the field spell before starting your combo, in the end you'll have 7-8 counter, so you dont have to worry in hindering your own negates.  Gizmeks have facility to special summon, so even if you dont get Deskbot 003 is still possible to combo.  One Darkruler no More or Forbidden droplet can make your board useless so i added Solemn Judgment to negate these spells.  When using pot of prosperity NEVER banish a combo piece.
