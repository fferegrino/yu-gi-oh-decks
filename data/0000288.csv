This build also includes new and better combos as well.
For full comb","For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on YouTube for more info.

This is an update to my U Link Code Talker Deck: https://ygoprodeck.com/the-u-link-code-talker-deck/
This build involves new cards that were added by the mod. It is much better than the older build and involves better combos. One thing that would make the deck much more consistent is the addition of 3 copies of Small World. Hope you enjoy this one. Until the next one, see ya.

This version is a more of a place holder while I experiment with exact ratios. This may be updated again in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this re-write I'll be going over the new combos, how this deck fairs against the meta and how to overcome it, and cards to swap in if the deck isn't quite working for you. For those re-reading this, I'll cut to the chase and start off with the new stuff so you don't have to re-read everything:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ancient Gear Ballista-</strong></p><p>This card is the predecessor of Crystron halquifibrax for this deck. It's a link 2 that takes 2 earth machines, on link summon, It adds Ancient gear from your deck to your hand. Ancient gear can special summon itself, or be used as a Discard for Knightmare Unicorn during a Telefon loop. Furthermore, Ancient Gear Ballista can pop Clockwork Night to give you Clockwork night's search effect and make an opponent's monsters ATK drop to 0 to help with OTKs. That's the card's use on it's own, but there are combo's for it, though I haven't discovered it's full potential as I only thought of using it last night. Alongside Urgent Schedule, this card takes you from brick to a minimoun of a Link-2 and 3 bodies on board and can tie into P.U.N.K combos if your opponent has an earth monster. So start off by summoning Gizmek Tainguku and Gizmek Uka with Urgent Schedule. Use both as link material for Ancient Gear Ballista, and use Ballista's effect to add and special summon Ancient Gear. Then banish Gizmek Tainguku to special summon Gizmek Uka from your gy, this triggers Uka's effect to special summon a monster from the deck. And the combo you go into from there vaties on what's in your hand and what you were able to summon from the deck. It can get as good as I:P Avramax + Hope Harbinger + Zeus off of just Urgent Schedule alone. This combo and the Garunteed discard for Knightmare Unicorn are all I've discovered for it so far though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Telefon Looping Methods-</strong></p><p>Sadly Halquifibrax got banned, but, there were enough ways to get Telefon on the field that Machine Duplication could pick up the slack. Telefon looping is done by having a Telefon on the field, and one in the gy. Telefon can summon Telefon from the gy, then use the Telefon that did that as material, then the newly summoned Telefon can summon the other Telefon back from the gy, causing an infinite summon loop that lets you gain LP in the process. So the first method is to-</p><ol><li>Summon a Single Telefon(Normal summon/Gizmek Naganaki effect/Urgent Schedule effect/Gizmek Tainguku effect/Gizmek Uka uka effect/Small world then normal summon).</li><li>Activate Machine Duplication, this summons 2 more Telefon to your field.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to link summon Ancient Gear Ballista, and activate it's effect to add Ancient gear to your hand. Then loop both back.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to link summon I:P Masquerena. Use Ballista And Masquerena to Link summon Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax. And loop both back.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to Link summon Qliphort Genius. Loop both back, then, use Genius to negate one and a card your opponent controls. Then use the negated telefon and Genius to link summon Knightmare unicorn.</li><li>Use Unicorns effect to discard Ancient Gear to shuffle a card your opponent controls back into the deck. Then use it and a Telefon to link summon Accesscode Talker.&nbsp;</li><li>Loop 1 Telefon back in DEFENSE POSITION, this Telefon will let you look at up to the top 6 cards of your deck depending on the dice roll, and organize them however you like, and if you don't like them, Telefon lets you put the cards on the bottom of your deck. Use both remaining Telefon to xyz summon Assembled Nightingale. After the battle phase, Nightingale can be used as xyz material to summon Zeus.</li></ol><p>Depending on what else you could get on the board, it's possible to make a combo consisting of up to 3 of 4 negate Apollousa, 3 negate Borreload Savage Dragon, Barrone de fleur, Hope Harbinger, Therion King, and Chengying in addition to the 5k Accescode &amp; I:P Avramax &amp; Zeus that the Telefon loop gave you.</p><p>The second Loop is a lot harder. You need to get 3 Telefon on the field/gy using any number of these different methods, before repeating the previous loop into your 2 link-4s and Zeus. You can use-</p><ul><li>Normal summon Gizmek Naganaki, then special summon Gizmek Arakami with its own effect. Tribute Arakami using Naganaki's effect to special summon Telefon from the deck. The banish Arakami using its own effect to send a Telefon from the deck to the gy.</li><li>Using just Naganaki or Arakami.</li><li>Sending Telefon from the hand to the gy via Foxy Tune or Clockwork Night effect.</li><li>Normal summon a Telefon.</li><li>Use urgent Schedule to special summon a Telefon from the deck.</li><li>Activate Gizmek Ukas effect that special summons Telefon/Gizmek Naganaki from the deck.</li></ul><p>And loop once you have the three Telefon. In the instance you draw a bunch of cards you can special summon via their own effects, it's possible to Telefon loop using just 2 Telefon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other new stuff-</strong></p><p>Ash blossom and Infinite Impermanence were added for disruption in place of a few cards you'll notice missing such as the field spells. With all the new cards that didn't have balanced stats, and and the 3 more spells, Gizmek Scrolls become less consistent. Therion discollusseum wasn't drawn enough to be a keeper over my other options to take out, so Terraforming followed suit. I took out the Chimeratech board wipe for being inconsistent, and I took out a Foxy Tune since you only need to search it once. Silent Grave Yard was added to the side deck to help against Tearalaments, and Ojama Trio was added to fend off Mystic mine(gives your opponent 3 monsters so you can mak unicorn to shuffle Mystic Mine back into the deck.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Qliphort Genius combos-</strong></p><p>Back to old stuff again, however Ancient Gear Ballista does spice up this old combo. Qliphort genius is a Link-2 that can negate a monster's effect you control other than itself to negat a face up card your opponent controls. It's unaffected by spells and traps so if it was out before skill drain was activated, it can negate it for the turn. In adition to that, it has another effect that let's you add a level 5 or higher machine from your deck to your hand if 2 monsters are summoned at the same to the zones it points to. The old play was to summon 2 machines(Arakami/Naganaki/Orochi/Uka/Therion King), then link them off for Genius. Then activate Urgent Schedule summoning 2 machines, then activate Genius effect to add Gizmek kaku. Banish Arakami you used for Genius to send Gizmek Orochi from your deck to the gy. Now you have a link-2 and 2-4 bodies that can easily be used to synchro spam. In this combo you can do things like small world a Gizmek Naganaki/Arakami/Uka to your hand, and banish Naganaki from the gy to get yet another body on board.</p><p>But, this combo is now twice as consistent, and twice as powerful. It goes like this-</p><ol><li>Summon 2 machines for Qliphort Genius. Now, use either Urgent Schedule or Machine Duplication to summon 2 Earth machines to the arrows, allowing you to add Uka/Orochi/Kaku/Therion king regulus from your deck to your hand.</li><li>Use both monsters Genius points to to Link summon Ancient Gear Ballista, and add Ancient gear from your deck to your hand and special summon it. You can use cards like Tainguku to summon uka from your gy and give you another two bodies, and you allready have two bodies in your hand you can summon from your hand via their own effects. You can use things like Emergency teleport or Ukas effect to atart P.U.N.K comboing in addition, if you used Machine Duplication, you can start Telefon looping in addition. This combo pretty much has it all. Without Telefon you can still end up with 2 link 2 and up to 7 bodies for comboing.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>On it's own, this card negates hinderinces and let you combo under cards such as Skill drain, Gozen match, and Zombie world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P.U.N.K Combos-</strong></p><p>PUNK help get cards to the gy for their gy effects, and can make a 1 card combo into a Zeus, or when in a combo, Can make Hope Harbinger and Zeus/Baronne:</p><ol><li>Normal summon Ze Amin or special summon it off of Gizmek Uka/Emergency Teleport.</li><li>Activate it's effect to add Foxy Tune.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Foxy tunes effect to discard a card to summon Deer note(the discard can allow for effects like that of Clockwork Night or Gizmek Tainguku, and the summon can trigger Gizmek Uka,).</li><li>Use Deer note and Ze Amin to synchro summon JAM Dragon Drive. Then either;</li></ol><p>Use Deer note to revive Ze Amin, and use JAM to add and summon Psychic Wheeleder. Use both level 3s to xyz summon JaJa, and make Zeus after the battle phase.</p><p>Revive Foxy tune and if you add it to the deck, add Ghost Ogre to your hand, then use both level 8 to xyz summon Hope Harbinger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kaiju &amp; co.-</strong></p><p>Kaijus, Nibiru, Lava Golem, and Sphere mode are all famous for their role of tributing opponents monsters before they can react, easily wipung threats away like a speck of dust on the play mat. Sphere mode is the best of these cards for the current format, however this deck uses Kumongus the sticky string kaiju. Kaijus have different attributes, and allow you to control what you summon off of Gizmek Uka. Kumongus lets you summin cards like Telefon and Ze Amin off of uka. Where as all Spheres can get you is a self destructing Obelisk the Tormentor. So I prefer Kaijus, but it's up to your preference here. 3 monsters, or 1 monster and a combo. The different Kaijus have different summons you can gain off of them, for every kaiju, there is a Gizmek card that shares the attribute, excluding WIND. So any can be used. Being a level 7, if you manage to get a Kaiju to your field you can easily use it as Baronne material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clockwork Night-</strong></p><p>This card has a few uses, the first one being an OTK. Urgent Schedule lets you go into some insane combos, but, only machines can attack the turn you use it. The majority of your extra deck aren't machines. But, Clockwork night not only makes them machines, but gives them 500 extra ATK while making your opponent loose 500. This let's you attack over pretty much anything. The second use is it's search effect. After being sent to the gy via foxy tune/knightmare unicorn/ancient gear ballista, you can banish it to discard a card, and search an earth machine. Letting you gain gy effects of your Gizmeks and letting you add powerful cards like Therion King Regulus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cards to swap in</strong><strong>-</strong></p><p>1&times;Ghost Ogre: Ghost ogre can be searched by Dragon Drive.</p><p>1xMachina Citadel: a good main deck boss monster if you can get it to the gy, it can destroy itself to destroy all monsters with less that 3000ATK on the field, and whenever an earth machine you control is destroyed, it summons itself back to the field.</p><p>3&times; Cyber Dragon nachester/1&times;Chimeratech Fortress dragon: ockwork night makes all monsters machine, so if you have nachester on your field, you can use it and all of your opponents monsters as fusion material for chimeratech fortress dragon. However you can't search clockwork night so this was rather inconsistent and removed from the deck.</p><p>1&times;Scarlight red dragon archfiend: Scarlight can destroy all monsters with lower or equal ATK to it. Alongside Clockwork night, this card can wipe away a card that was once at 4000ATK,&nbsp; with Chengying, you can wipe away practically anything if enough cards are banished. Even better, Scarlight deals 500 damage for each card destroyed, dealing up to 5500 effect damage and 3000 battle damage all on its own in a full field.</p><p>Gizmek Inaba, the hopping hare of hakuto: More OTK stuff, you can banish this card from the gy to make a face up machine you control whos stats are balanced gain ATK equal to that of all other machines you control with balanced stats, but only it can attack this turn. Ancient gear balista can change an opponents ATK to 0, so in a Qliphort Genius combo, it's possible to give a single gizmek enough ATK to OTK.</p><p>Limiter removal: This card doubles all your machines ATK, but destroys them during the end phase. So another OTK card. Clockwork night makes Avramax a machine with 3500ATK, that gets doubled to 7000! 7500 if you count the fact that Clockwork night makes your opponent's monster loose 500ATK. Due to Avramax's effect, it will almost alwayse deal it's ATK stat as damage, meaning on its own this card will almost alwayse do 7500 damage in this scenario. Accesscode talker's ATK can shoot up as high as 11600!</p><p>Gizmek Scrolls: This field spell lets you look at the top 3 cards of your deck to add a machine with balanced stats to your hand,&nbsp; and banish the other two face down. It has an additional effect to where when you summon a monster with balanced stats 10 times, all monsters wothout balanced stats have their effects negated. This excludes link monsters.</p><p>Therion discollusseum: this field spell lets you add a Therion King regulus to your hand upon activation. It also gives you battle protection once per turn that lets you add another therion king regulus.</p><p>Brain research lab: normal summon P.U.N.K in addition to your normal summon/set.</p><p>Terraforming.</p><p>Iron call: monster reborn for level 4 and lower machines but their effects are negated.</p><p>Dimensional&nbsp; barrier: pick an extra deck mechanic, it doesn't exist this turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meta/Bad matchups &amp; how to counter it-</strong></p><p>Spright- pretty much lost their spark now but you still see them around. Use a negate on spright Blue/starter, silent graveyard stops frog shinanigans, and most of the time you should be able to combo around 2 or 3 negates.</p><p>Branded- you can outlast branded resource wise, if you need to, they honestly don't do alot other than banish a single card and change your ATK to zero, the occasional shrimp that can attack all your monsters. Other than that it's play around generic disruption as you usually would.</p><p>Exosister- step 1. Pray. Step 2. Kaiju. Exosister suck, this deck relies on it's gy alot so really you need a kaiju, or bait them while trying to make zeus so you can combo next turn when you get your gy back.</p><p>Tearalaments- The second threat, you have Silent gy to shut them entirely down if you draw it, you have your 7 disruption cards, your kaijus who don't help much as it triggers fusion summoning. Ojama trio helps too funnily enough, they only get 2 monster zones and an extra monster zone that way, which cuts how much they can fusion summon against you. If you manage to get a barrier statue out alongside Avramax, you can kill them as they won't be able to summon at all. So go first and pray for a decent hand.</p><p>Trap based decks- Just use red reboot. Oh wait, konami decided right now was a great time to ban it and give them a card that searches normal traps right after giving them a monster that searches continuous traps. You can use Cosmic cyclone to banish the troublesome ones, Ojama trio saves the day again as it stops eldilich from harassing you with trap monsters. Making therion king early in a turn can help a TON, but other than that you play like usual. Against cards like there can be only one and gozen match, Qliphort genius can negate them. In rare cases, you can make Genius under summon limit. Knightmare unicorn and I:P Masquerena are both different types from eachother and your machine based deck, allowing you to make unicorn under there can be only one to shuffle it back into the deck.</p><p>Mystic mine- banish it with cosmic space cyclone. Ojama trio can give your opponent 3 monsters, allowing you to compress your board into a knightmare unicorn so you can shuffle the mystic mine away, then set up negates to stop it from coming back out.</p><p>Zombie world &amp; co.- these cards change your typing from machine, wrecking your plays. Knightmare unicorn, cosmic space cyclone, qliphort genius, and clockwork night negate these kind of cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Kshatri-la- I haven't fought them, but they are going to be meta with that new support no doubt. Firstly, Gizmek has a strange archtype specific damage control. Kshatri la banish your cards face down, but Gizmek Naganaki can add a face down banished machine with balanced stats from banished face down to your hand. So that helps. This archtype has a variety of attributes, so barrier statue Avramax hits them hard. They are a somewhat combo deck so Ojama trio should help by filling monster zones, but you are a combo deck as well, so them negating your ability to use zones is just as impactful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for now, as always, hope you enjoy!</p>"

-I've worked a lot with Dragon Link and this is the current version I run. ","The basic idea of the deck is using the brave engine and red rose engine to create card advantage and to use the dragon link engine as powerful extenders to end on power-houses such as <strong>Baronne De Fleur</strong>, <span class=""a-size-large product-title-word-break""><strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</strong> (Hot Red),  the recently released </span><span><strong>Borrelend Dragon</strong>, <strong>I:P</strong> and <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>. Often times you also put a <strong>Fairy Tail Snow</strong> in the grave to have more points of interruption. The deck uses its crazy amounts of extension and high potential boards to completely shut out an opponent going first and to push through interruptions going second. </span>

The most basic combo of the deck only needs <strong>Rite of Aramesia </strong>and any <strong>Tuner</strong> monster in the deck. The standard combo of the deck needs <strong>Rite of Aramesia</strong><strong>, </strong>Any<strong> Normal Summon</strong>, and any<strong> Extender</strong>.

Dragon Link has many powerful extenders like <strong>Chaos Space &amp; Quick Launch</strong>. Both cards create loads of card advantage (Both are normally a plus 2-5 in card advantage) and allow you to extend into more plays.

The deck is very consistent. With my testing, the deck has a <strong>9/10 for playable hands </strong>with <strong>7/10 being full combo</strong> (low on bricks) and an average <strong>1 hand-trap/going-second card per hand</strong>.

One weakness of the deck is a lack of going second card room, this is why I main <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>, for its high impact in the current meta going second.

The last cards I want to mention are <strong>Chaos Dragon</strong> <strong>Levianeer &amp; Chaos Ruler The Chaotic Magical Dragon.</strong> Due to the deck's playstyle, it is not as consistent to get Levi into rotation but it is still viable as an extra option for massively powerful effects such as <strong>Non-Targerting Destruction x2 &amp; Hand Ripping</strong>, both effects a plus 2 in card advantage and very impactful. Chaos Ruler is the gambler of the deck. He enables a powerful boss monster in <strong>Hot Red</strong> and gives you the potential for massive amounts of advantage in sending 4 cards into your grave and 1 to your hand (Normally E<strong>ffect Veiler</strong> or a Levi).

I don't think it's an unpopular opinion that Dragon link is very hard to pilot, and while I do think that the use of the adventure engine makes the deck easier to play I don't think that the higher ceiling of difficulty is gone. Because at the core the dragon link cards are the cards that win you games. <span><strong>Borrelend Dragon </strong>is the new MVP of the deck and frankly, a lot of decks don't have consistent ways to out the card making it a real obstacle for some players.</span>

So after hours of searching through different archetypes trying to find cards that I believe roughly resemble the gagagigo/lizardman look I ended up with this, The Lizardman Aliens deck. The engine of this deck is the Alien archetype engine, unfortunately unlike my other decks this one didn't meld together as well but it's still a functioning deck although pretty slow sometimes depending on your hand. If you're a fan of casual slower games this deck is good for you however against pretty much any other casual deck you'll probably get stomped.

The point of the decks I am making is to take a theme I like and make a cool deck with it and as long as the deck functions properly and is cool then I'll post it.

Anyway, thanks for checking out this weird Lizardman-Alien deck!"

Albaz","Hi there ! Today presentation of my B.E.Z deck that I currently play in competitive format and in IRL and I particularly appreciate it. And the only changes you can make would be to re-add ''Branded Opening'' to access ''Aluber, The Jester of Despia'' more easily and therefore access ''Branded Fusion'' more quickly, and remove a Extra Deck slot to play ''Masquerade The Blazing Dragon'' to inflict effect damage to your opponent then it still has good ATK.

Do not hesitate to contact me via social networks (the links in the description of the YouTube video) if you ever have any questions or constructive opinions on the deck.

&nbsp;

So there isn't much to be discussed today for I have other plans in real life. I was bored and decided to spend more time practicing on utilizing obscure and absurd tech options with rogue decks. That being said, today's deck is basically a can of Whoop-Ass; but that said can has maggots, cockroaches, and possibly mosquitos infected with malaria virus. To fix this, I disposed the said can of Whoop-Ass, and replaced it with a fresh can of actual fresh tasting utilities and flavor. Now we must proceed to the usual descriptions of what it is that said current thing of thing, because it is my job to do so.

&nbsp;

First and foremost, <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma </a>is no more; but if you can't make proper link plays and have <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> ready to be played, then you can go for pass for your opponents turn. Now besides what I mentioned earlier, one in particular I have been working on utilizing for Mathmechs is the newly released Link-3 monster, <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>: a link monster that has a quick effect that draws 1 card for 1000LP (during either players turn); and can Special summon a Link-3 or lower Cyberse monster from your Extra deck (if your LP's are 2000 or lower) by banishing the card from the field. Now, I have also used the <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> pass with <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>, and I prefer it over <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> for reasons of consistency over OTK utilization. Plus given I can have proper target for <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> given I have used most of my Link monsters for <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.

&nbsp;

Next comes the other stuff I have worked with that I never expected to use; but used anyways for better or worse. Despite the banning of <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> can still be utilized in two different ways: either with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax </a>to <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a> (which was the most easiest and common way of activating the Scythe Lock); or a Link-2 monster within the Artifact archetype known as Artifact Dagda (which can set it during either players turn when an effect is played; but is destroyed during the end phase, which makes it more predictable). Then comes the newly limited card <a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart </a>(which allows you to control a monster until the End Phase, regardless of what type of monster it is). Honorable mentions in my deck include <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> (which is a +2, -1 if removed from the field), <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> (an XYZ monster that just searches for Mathmech pieces such as ""Mathmech Diameter""), and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> (special summons itself from the hand if you link summon during your turn, then special summons another copy of itself from your deck; but both copies are treated as LV4)."

Tri-brigade engine makes Lunalight turn one pretty consistent to set up. For going Turn 2, you'll want to leverage the forbidden droplets and dark ruler no more. One suggestion is to run 1 copy of Zeus to overcome Eldlich skill drain locks since this build is running 3 droplets anyways and since this deck spams XYZ's.

You can use unchained monsters passively (set one of the lower unchained monsters and let them spawn each other in the turn of the enemy) or aggressively ( attack the enemy multiple times. By using the quick effect of Rakea or Escape of the unchained you can destroy your monsters during Battle Phase for extra dmg).

After some iterations (also playing this deck as Evil Eye + Unchained), I can say this deck has reached a fairly balanced state. Going first or 2nd is completely valid.

Going first I try to end on I:P, Soul of Rage and Rakea. This allows me to activate the effect of I:P and chain Soul of Rage as CL2 right after a monster has been summoned by the opponent. Linking into a link 3 with a monster of the enemy and link into a link 4 (unchained abomination or avramax) with I:P. Rakea could now trigger abominations effect.

Elsewise the deck is built so that enemy bord destruction is allways possible.

Side deck is almost only for playing against backrow heavy decks."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.

This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.

1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.

2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!

3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions

4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt;

Solfadark is a combination of the solfachord main deck monsters and a dark engine that consists of Armageddon Knight, Zephyros, The PK engine, Destiny Hero Malicious, and the very well known Darkwurm + Dragon Shrine + Gate setup that so many Solfachord decks use. The main idea of the deck is that your gameplay is setup into two separate parts: before pendulum summoning and after pendulum summoning.

The solfachord engine works amazingly to setup for a card like Beyond The Pendulum, which can then search for a missing pendulum scale (usually gate), harmonizer magician as it leads to halq very easily and special summons more material, or Gracia so you can get your field spell out. After your pendulum summon you will mainly be relying on your dark engine pieces (mainly the phantom knight cards unless you draw into Arma) to generate resources because a large majority of the time you will be able to link Beyond The Pendulum and another dark monster such as a plague spreader or darkwurm in order to go into rusty bardiche. From that point you can send cloak, set the brigandine, banish the cloak to add boots, and get creative with the raw amount of materials you can now put on the field. This concept was developed after realizing the deck does not need cards like Loagaeth as they can already get the materials on board for BTP fairly consistently, but struggle to find more resources after pendulum summoning. Cards like Diviner of The Herald are still AMAZING in Solfachord, the only problem is that I am not an oil baron who can drop $240 on a playset of them compared to this much cheaper and equally as effective alternative. Despite being a 45 card deck I have found that its incredibly consistent and also can not think of any cards to take out, if you have any ideas of cards to take out or some ideas on how to improve the deck please shoot me a message on twitter @Gliscare.

&nbsp;

Basic Combo:
Assuming a two card hand of Cutia + Dragon Shrine you can go into the following:
Dragon Shrine Send Darkwurm, special darkwurm, add Gate Zero
Normal Cutia, add Dreamia
Darkwurm + Cutia make BTP, set  Gate and Dreamia as scales
Add harmonizer to hand
Pendulum Summon Cutia, Darkwurm, and Harmonizer. Activate Harmonizer to special summon Oafdragon
BTP + Darkwurm to make Rusty Bardiche, Bardiche send cloak, set Brigandine and special summon it, banish cloak add Boots and special summon Boots
Harmonizer + Cutia, Boots, or Brigandine to make Halq, special summon plague spreader
Plague Spreader + Oafdragon make Borrelload Savage Dragon, target BTP in grave
From here you can either make a three material Apollousa or use the leftover materials to make IP, then use IP + Halq to make Avramax which can be very hard to out if your opponent is not ready for it.
Banish boots and set fog blade

In addition to that combo theres also a number of extensions you can do via Armageddon Knight by sending cards like Zephyros to the grave so you can summon a hand trap off of halq and then bounce it back to your hand with Zephyros or by sending Malicious to grave for extra material. Whatever you do the deck is shockingly versatile and is an absolute blast to play once you start looking into it more and more. The deck can play through a negate or two depending on the hand, though as it is still solfachords it is painfully fragile at times hence why cards like Instant Fusion and Called By The Grave are here.

""Why is Instant Fusion Here""
Instant Fusion is always an amazing card to draw as it can summon Restrict to protect your Cutia, BTP, or Armageddon Knight from being negated or you can summon Ciel to have a pendulum for BTP in a pinch (it comes up alot more than you'd think). Ciel is an espescially good target as you can pendulum summon her back to the field like any other face up pendulum monster so she can recur herself if you have the proper scales."

But. If you do, each engine should be able to get out their own monsters on their own, and for anything else, there's Drytron.

Manju and Prep can search Sauravis if necessary. If you *really really* want to, you can run Sprite's Blessing to actually summon Sauravis (and any other light attribute ritual in the deck).

Pre-prep can search Libromancer Bonded and Fireburst if going for an OTK and Firestarter if you want to give Fireburst added protections. Mystigirl enables this by reducing one of their ATK position monsters to 0.

Extra Deck can also run 1 N'tss 3 Arc Light or vice versa if you prefer. Linkuriboh interchangeable with Relinquished Anima as well.

Don't ask how you side anything in and out, you might as well cut an entire archetype at that point."

</span>

<span>First thing you do is summon Aluber, activate his effect, add <em>Branded Fusion</em> then activate Branded Fusion and use any Witchcrafter monster + <em>Fallen Of Albaz</em> to fusion summon <em>Albion The Branded Dragon</em>, activate its effect and use the Fallen you just used for Abilion and the Aluber on your field to fusion summon <em>Lubellion the Searing Dragon, </em>after that activate its effect to fusion summon Vice-master by discarding the one Witchcrafter monster in your hand and using it as a material with the other Witchcrafter that you sent to the graveyard by summoning Albion.
</span>

<span>After getting Vice-Master on the field, you have a non-targetable destruction of one card on the fiel to disrubt your opponent. If you have something like <em>Witchcrafter Creation, </em>use it to add <em>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru </em>for protection and a bounce on one card your opponent controls, if he tries to attack your Vice-Master or try to destroy it. After that your focus should be to get <em>Witchcrafter Madame Verre</em> on the field, so you can have a negate on all your opponents face up monsters that he currently controls by discarding one spell from your hand which you can immediately add back by using Vice-Master's effect.
If your fusion summons are disrubted, try and summon 2 of your level 8 monster on your turn so you can at least go into Number 38 to have some protection. If the dragons that you used to get Vice-Master on the field are still alive on your next turn you can go into Dingirsu or Number 38 depending on the situation. You cna also use Vice-Master to try and destroy Dingirsu with her destruction, then send one of the materials to the graveyard and if it's Albion, </span><span>during the end phase add one<em> Branded Fusion </em>or <em>Branded Opening</em> depending on if you have a DARK monster to use for 2 other dragons.
</span>

<span><em>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</em> is just a backup if you can't go into Vice-Master as it can send something like Ash or Abyss Dragon to the graveyard to add more Branded cards in the end phase and non-target banish one monster on the field.
</span>

<span>Getting the lower level Witchcrafters will be easy for you with Vice-Master's effect and with them you can special summon one of the higher levels Witchcrafters by discarding one spell but with Vice-Master's third effect you essentially do this for no cost, as you can add back the spell card you just </span><span>discarded.
</span>

<span>If by any chance your opponent tries to destroy your fusion monsters by a card effect, you can just banish <em>Branded Fusion</em> and protect them

</span>

<span>This is my first time making something like this, i hope you enjoy the deck!</span>"

Rappa + Gravitino: Do the same as above except that you search ""S-Force Showdown"" instead of Chase - acc Showdown to SS Rappa from hand - link into ""S-Force Justify""

Justify can banish up to three cards and is also a monster negate. In case you dont have a way of establishing three monsters onto your field, Retroactive can be of help.

Disclaimer I did not put in the newer card. You can substitute the hand traps with any other hand trap or even pots; (forbidden droplet would probably make this deck better but tbh I haven't bought the card so I didn't ""test"" it in this deck).

This deck helps you work around almost any deck. how you use it is that using the Invokers as the muscle and the pushup as the engine/""emergency backup"" Because you are playing invoker you'll have access to many combinations and safe guards. In this deck your elements (for invoke) will consist of Fire (mainly), earth, and dark. You can use other elements if you want to use hand traps as materials (ogre for example--has come in handy).

The Suship engine uses the Invoker field spell to activates its own effects.

DPE- Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer can be summoned through Invoker's Meltdown. The down side is that you'll have to gather the materials by drawing; which can be covered through the drawing mechanic of Suship and any pot cards you can substitute. The reason I put plasma and dogma is because of Destiny END Dragoon (it has defiantly came up several times) and it also gives you more opportunity to summon either.

<span>I've been dying to write another Salamangreat decklist in forever. Problem is, there are so many tournament decklists, why bother writing up my own. Not because it's bad or worse but because tournament decks have a level of credibility other decklists don't. So there's no reason for you guys to check out my regular Salamangreat list if you could netdeck one that topped. *insert bragging about being 4-1 at regionals with Salamangreats and then delete this note* I'm not playing some weird tech either that would make it worth discussing over. My Salamangreat list is the most basic it's ever been: Bufferlo, Salamangreats, Heatsoul and Handtraps. I will say I fell in love with Will of the Salamangreats again and put it at 2 after playing it at 1 since forever and I love it and Bufferlo always has and always will be the best card in the game! See, 2 sentences and you've probably figured out my entire decklist by now without even looking at it. </span>

<span>After extensively making clear as to why you don't need a Salamangreat decklists coming from me, here's a Salamangreat decklist :-)))))) SIKE! Well, sike but also not really sike. It's not how I would advise you to play Salamangreat. Earlier I said I didn't play any tech cards, right? So this list is ""<span>What If: Salamangreats were teched to the brink?</span>""</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The Cyberse Techs</span>

<span>We had Dragon Link and then recently Plant Link as link decks that revolve around a type rather than an archetype and while Cyberse has pretty much always been able to, Heatsoul is what started making Cyberse Link a viable choice recently. But what I didn't like about that is how they used Salamangreat as an engine to get into Heatsoul. No Rage. No Roar. So this is the Cyberse Link stuff cramped into a Salamangeat deck. The gameplan is unchanged. Make Sunlight Wolf or Heatsoul but now you can end on either an omni negate that banishes and/or an omni negate, a handloop and monster removal on top of it.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Code Talker</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>You're probably familiar with this one. People have tried to cope this into existence for Salamangreat decklists for a while and it never really came about.</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Micro Coder"">Micro Coder</a></span>: You use it in hand to summon a Code Talker monster from the Extra Deck to then search Cynet Conflict.</span></li>
 	<li><span><a data-name=""Cynet Conflict:""><span>Cynet Conflict</span>:</a> Salamangreat Roar but for Code Talkers.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Prior it was used to summon Transcode Talker using Micro Coder and Sunlight Wolf, then summon Wolf again with Transcode and then Reincarnate Summon that Wolf. Now you have an additional omni negate, Wolf and Transcode have more ATK and can't be targeted.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Now can be used to make Heatsoul instead. Included some Coder Talker Link-2s to use Micro Coder with.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Slightly raises the ceiling but also consumes more ressources and you can't recurse Gazelle with Wolf using the classic Transcode line.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li><strong><span>Mathmech</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Now we're getting to the good stuff. This one is not even out yet in the TCG but it's a pretty strong 1-card engine over in the OCG (if it doesn't see any play it's because OCG keeps inventing new ways to pull of a tier 0 format)</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Mathmech Circular"">Mathmech Circular</a></span>: Sends an absolute Sigma Male from your deck the Graveyard to SS itself. If a Mathmech is then summoned it adds a Mathmech S/T.</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a></span>: Chad just summons itself from the freaking graveyard. So cool.</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Mathmech Superfactorial"">Mathmech Superfactorial</a></span>: The trap you then add with Circular. XYZ summons on your opponent's turn (it's good I promise)</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a></span>: overlay Circular and Sigma for this one, detach both to add a Mathmech monster to hand and then tribute itself to summon that monster.</span></li>
 	<li><span class=""name_txt selectable""><span><a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a></span>: A Mathmech Synchro or XYZ using this card as material gets an omni negate effect the turn it is summoned.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Link off Diameter to start your play, most often into Balelynx.</span></li>
 	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a></span>: On your opponent's turn use the trap to SS all three monsters and use them to make this XYZ. then you can loop a random card out of your opponent's hand, send a monster he control and out a backrow (this one won't come up often)</span></li>
 	<li><span>Now your opponent's is a card short in hand, a monster on the field is gone and you still have an omni negate left. This combo is insane and that's a 1-card combo without using up your normal summon. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span>Is this the best way to play Salamangreat? I doubt it, at least not in this form. But is it funny? Slightly!</span>"

Here's my take on the deck (Based on the TCG banlist, though the only things i'd consider from OCG are Maxx ""C"", Dimensional Fissure and Macrocosmos)

Here's the explanation of uses and ratios:

<strong>3x Kshatri-La Fenrir/Unicorn/Ogre</strong>: As of yet the only main deck Ksha monsters, they search Monsters/Spells/Traps respectively while also disrupt the opponents play by banishing cards facedown. Normally you see a 3/3/3 ratio on the lists and the reason behind that is, well... There's barely any other choice, the archetype is still quite small so it really relays on swarming from deck, either way, the three of them are very good cards that almost never represent a brick on hand.

<strong>3x/1x Danger! Nessie!/Dogman!:</strong> One of the examples of ""easy"" to summon lv7 monsters, and after some testing, arguably the worst ones, yes they're extenders and give some draw power (la berth combos with them). BUT the random nature of Danger! makes them really unreliable, a wrong discard can be really detrimental and by themselves (no other cards on hand) they're practically useless. The 3/1 ratio obviously goes on favor of Nessie since she's the searcher.

<strong>3x Instant Contact/The Ascended of Thunder</strong>: Really good extenders and combo pieces, basically free lv7 bodies on board anytime, anywhere, just by giving LP (like, does that even matters in modern YGO?, lmao), the ascended of thunder it's not even OPT. 3/3 is a must.

<strong>2x Psi-beast/Astral Kuriboh</strong>: A tricky pair. Psi-beast comboes really well with la berth/prepare to extend even further and Astral Kuriboh is a free lv7 that can make a harder to get rid of Diablosis/Harmonizer (remember that this is a lingering effect, so even if their effects get negated they remain indestructible) .The only reason i don't just dump the dangers and play 3 of each is because of ""Seven Star Sword"", which needs a lv7 monster aaaaand, thinking it again, i may just do that. Needs some testing tho.

<strong>3x Ash/Imperm</strong>: Nothing to explain here, just the HT's (if you want to swap them for other one go ahead).

<strong>1x Pankatrops</strong>: Kinda a tech. Is only useful on turn 2 onwards but gives isolation and puts pressure on board, may be drop on an update.

<strong>3x Seven Star Sword:</strong> A staple on the deck, not only the draw power is really good, it also comboes with ksha by using la berth/prepare to just re-summon the monster you just banished.

<strong>2x Pot of Desires/Triple Tactics Talents</strong>: Still not convinced with desires, yes, since this list uses 3 of each ksha monster is really unlikely you'd just banish 3 copies of the same one, but i just don't like to risk it, you know?. TTT is basically called by cope, another option would be a handtrap such as veiler/droll. Desires is semi-limited and 3 TTT is an overkill, so i think 2/2 is okay.

<strong>3x Kshatri-La Berth</strong>: I can see why some people won't run it at 3 like i do, but it's just so useful, to the point where you want to see it in your opening hand, even if the following copies are unusable, it's just great.

<strong>1x Kshatri-La Prepare</strong>: Useful, but not as useful as La Berth, if by some misfortune i lose it, well, i'll just have to deal with it.

Extra Deck:

Instant contact targets, various R7NK options to deal with various situations and Soldier of chaos because we are using lv7 monsters. But the most important ones are ""Kshatri-La Shangri-La"" which gives you the swarming capabilities to out-resource your opponent while also blocking their zones. ""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"", Shangri-La's sidekick, by removing from play cards directly from the Extra Deck you can really block your opponents play, and he's an huge contributor of shangri-la's lockdown. ""Number 76 Harmonizer Gradielle"" another target for astral kuriboh, a decent way of disrupting plays by attaching opponent's monster from the GY.

&nbsp;

<strong>This deck is crazy and can get some surprisingly strong board out, watch the games to see how we do it. </strong>

&nbsp;

This deck is cray cray and so much fun and guess what we aren't using Auroradan like so many other decks out there. We decided to take the difficult way out and play with the awesome Guardian Eotos instead. This deck focuses on getting Mystical shine balls out to scale out links and build incredible chad like boards. Watch the video absorb my knowledge and be the best duelist there is.

Edited slightly for master duel

This deck can handle Swordsoul, Despia, Adamancipator, and even tri-brigade thanks to numerous cards such as:
A negate (Mechaba)
A floodgate (Winda)
A Second negate (Fleurdelis)
A second floodgate (If winda goes to gy [Caliga])
etc...

This deck is easy to learn, and is one of my favorites so far!
Please, leave any suggestions in the comments.
------------------------------
This deck is very linear, so I'll show an example combo to show how it works.
Normal Summon Aleister the Invoker, add invocation, summon almiraj, summon secure gardna using almiraj, activate invokation and summon mechaba. Now you have a 1 card combo w/ a negate on board.

Dogmatika monsters are used as some sort of engine to get another negation on board (Fleurdelis) but also have a great sinergy w/ shaddolls (Maximus sending to gy Apkallone, etc...)

Shaddolls are used to get construct or winda quick, so its pretty useful!

If you'd like to know more about how this deck works and/or want to get reference for some combos, please join the Invoked discord server!!! they are very kind! Just search for Yugioh Deck Discord Repository and you'll have access to the archetype's discord!"

Updated the list and added a write up","Use the many starters in the deck to assemble Naturia Molcricket and Naturia Camellia to create control boards with the toolbox of Naturia monsters, supplemented by the Therion engine. Extra Deck is customizable.

Updated the list and giving a more indepth explanation of my card choices

3 Naturia Molcricket and 3 Naturia Camellia - The core of the deck. Both of these cards sets up the other and are the best normal summons in the deck. Sets up your graveyard to disrupt your opponents plays. Most games begin by getting both of these cards into rotation. Camellia is also a tutor for any naturia cards by sending Naturia Sacred Tree and Molcricket can help you catch up going second.

3 Lonefire Blossom - Extra copies of Camellia. Can also be used to start your Therion engine.

2 Naturia Marron - By far the weakest starter in the deck but sometimes Marron send Molcricket is all you got. Other than that it recycles your naturias for grind games.

1 One for One - Summons Molcricket without taking your normal summon, lets you end your first turn on boards that aren't just Camellia + Regulus

1 Foolish Burial - Sets up graveyard, sends Molcricket or a therion in a pinch

3 Foolish Burial Goods - Essentially ROTA here. Sends sacred tree to search any Naturia Card

3 Therions' ""Lily"" Borea - You probably know why this is here. Search the field spell to get Regulus for an omni. Also can send Sacred Trees you've drawn to search.

1 Therions' ""King"" Regulus - Big stats, omni negate, level 8 for Dingirsu

1 Therions' Ring, The Colosseum Saucer - Searches your Regulus, pretty great in a grind game as well. Bump this and Regulus up to 2 if you want

Naturia Tool Box

2 Naturia Horneedle - This is your main source of disruption. In tandem with Camellia and Antjaw can be triggered quite a few times.

1 Naturia Sunflower - Monster negate. Pretty strong if you have Camellia, otherwise the cost is steep

1 Naturia Antjaw - Ammo for your tribute effects, could get away with running more of these but i didn't feel it was necessary

1 Naturia Rosewhip - Floodgate summonable off of Halq. Can be used to completely shut off your opponents Spell/Traps

1 Naturia Vein - Spell/trap negate. Same deal as Sunflower but can be used with Rosewhip to completely shut off Spell/Traps

These next 3 are only in the deck because their level is convenient or are pretty good extenders

1 Naturia Hydrangea - having a level 5 is nice to summon off of Molcricket if you need a synchro monster quickly. can summon itself.

1 Naturia Cosmobeet - Just wanted a level 2 tuner

1 Naturia Ladybug - The best of these three by far, I use it in my turn one combos often as link material for Seraphim Papillon. Seraphim, Beast, Regulus and Molcricket is a pretty doable setup

3 Naturia Spring Breeze - Really good spell. Is by far the best extender in the deck and can be used on your opponents turn to drop synchros. Not a single once per turn on this card.

3 Naturia Sacred Tree - Had this at 2 but it proved to be a very good card to send for costs. Its non-search effect is sometime relevant as well.

1 Called by the Grave - Getting handtrapped can sometimes turn your entire deck off. Honestly probably should cut some of the worse naturias to run a Crossout Designator package.

3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - i just picked the first hand trap to come to mind.

Extra

Naturia Exterio - Probably never gonna summon this but its better than Gaiastrio

Baronne De Fleur - Its the best synchro monster in the game

Borreload Savage Dragon - The second best synchro in the game, although i often find myself in situations where i haven't summoned a link monster to equip to it

Naturia Barkion - Doesn't come up very often, its really here just to have another naturia name for ladybug so any of the other synchros would do this is just the least bad of them excluding beast

Naturia Beast - incredibly good and very easy to summon. often a piece in my better setups

Herald of the Arc Light - Its another omni

Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton - Big negate monster, my Strenae target

Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star - Cleans up the board on the crack back.

Strenae the Rikka Queen - Recycles your Camellias and Lonefires. tribute it to aromaseraphy jasmine to summon Hyperyton

Meliae of the Trees - never summoned this but i'd rather have it then not

Accesscode Talker - You know why this is here

Knightmare Unicorn - Mostly to climb into accesscode

Papillon Seraphim - Proactive way to get Molcricket back on the board. Sometimes if i already have a molcricket in rotation i'll send a Horneedle to the graveyard to summon with this

Aromaseraphy Jasmine - Not sold on this TBH, might go with Crossrose Dragon instead, much easier to summon but needs another monster in the extra as a target.

Crystron Halqifibrax - Theoretically has some pretty powerful setups, i haven't practiced them yet so i have no idea what to do here. Could always put a Jet Synchron in the deck

Cards im considering

Naturia Mantis - Might be a sideboard card for Floo but the cost kind of doesn't jive with the deck

Naturia Ragweed - Might be good if you're running more handtraps than i am and you know your opponent is running draw spells.

Naturia Stinkbug - Could potentially make you unkillable in a grind game

Crossrose Dragon - alternative to Jasmine. Needs another extradeck slot which isn't a big problem, you can do anything with the extra deck.

Periallis, Empress of Blossoms - My Crossrose target of choice, summons Borea from the grave

I:P Masquerena - You create a ton of material on your opponents turn

Apollousa - I:P Target, but i dont feel like you can summon it early enough for it to do much

Retaliating ""C"" - Decent handtrap, relevant typing

Contact ""C"" - for the Realiating search

I've considered insect stuff but i dont think theres enough synergy there, Resonance Insect has potential but i don't think theres enough Doom Dozer targets in this deck.

The other Naturia spell traps dont have Naturia in the name making them unsearchable so i don't think they're consistent enough to justify. The field spell search is okay but you dont really want the naturias in hand unless you're running mantis.

No draw spells, didn't seem necessary, the new support makes the deck Super consistent

All in all I think the new support is exactly what the deck needed. Naturia has always had a lack of enablers for their low key busted effects but Molcricket and Camellia do exactly what the deck wants. The strengths of the deck lie in being very, very consistent and adaptable but its still not very capable of power plays. I think you can win games with it, its just not easy due to nonlinear setups and having to know which Naturias are relevant in matchups. I'm very excited to play more of this deck, it might end up being my main."
