The first was DM, I am going with the Goat format banlist in a trad style (banned cards can be played at one). The second I pulled Catapult turtle from MRD I knew what I would play this deck. My only real laments would be my awful IOC luck where I pulled nothing good, I only got one chaos sorc, and none of the big chaos monster (I was really hoping for DMOC). The side deck is to go into P.A.C.M.A.N. if I don't think the scientist thing works out."

So I took the main Ogdoadic engine and paired it with Rokket Dragon Link (now Rokket Dragon Link + King of Feral Imps). Honestly, I'm not sure if I provided an alternative to the deck, or threw a massive monkey wrench in it - I mean, Rokket Dragon Link really isn't my cup of tea. Anyways, if not, I'll try Ogdoadic Nemesis, because that seems proising as well."

Something extra is that some Ignister cards have effects of change of ATK and effect damage, with a combination of specific cards a quite satisfactory OTK of effect damage can be achieved.  <strong>The Combo Pieces</strong>  <strong>Fire Phoenix:</strong> The most important piece, when it attacks it can cancel the battle damage to be able to do effect damage equal to its ATK  <strong>Cyberse Accelerator:</strong> This card is usually not very useful, it is pretty bad above all, but this card can give 2000 ATK to a monster that it targets which is necessary for Fire Phoenix.  <strong>Donyoribo:</strong> It is a quite useless ignister in a normal recipe, this has the effect of banishing the GY to double an effect damage with a Fire Phoenix with 4300 ATK the damage would fall by 8600 for a win.  <strong>Ignister &amp; A.I</strong>  <strong>Achichi:</strong> One of the best Ignister since he can look for another Ignister which is easy to summon thanks to the field.  <strong>Pikari:</strong> Achichi but he looks for Magic / Traps, he is especially good when looking for his Monster Reborn.  <strong>Bururu:</strong> You can send Donyoribo to the GY, it is also searchable with Wicckid.  <strong>Doyon:</strong> He can retrieve the used monster from Normal Summon to summon it again with the field or return a Spell/Trap.  <strong>When A.I. First Met You:</strong> Monster Searcher.  <strong>A.I.dle Reborn:</strong> Revive an Ignister.  <strong>A.I.Land:</strong> The main engine of the Ignister Stuff, really neccesary.  <strong>The Arrival Cyberse:</strong> Boss monster of the Archetype that is totally impeccable, if you go first it is a good option.  <strong>Dark Templar</strong>: Another important piece since it can Spam the Ignisters already used as material, even so sometimes you can go from summon it and going directly with Fire Phoenix.  <strong>Dark Infant:</strong> Search the field.  <strong>Cyberse Stuff</strong>  <strong>Parallel eXceed:</strong> Summon two monsters on the field easily.  <strong>Mathmech Addition:</strong> Another easy monster to summon, it can also increase the ATK of Fire Phoenix if you want.  <strong>Code Generator:</strong> It can be used as material from the hand, you can also send Donyoribo to the GY, also in some cases you can add it instead.  <strong>Cynet Mining:</strong> Search Cyberses.  <strong>Crusadia Avramax:</strong> Another Boss Monster option.  <strong>Transcode Talker:</strong> It can also be used for Code Generator activation, plus it can revive.  <strong>Code Talker Inverted:</strong> Summons Cyberse from the hand, it is also the main monster to summon with Code Generator.  <strong>Splash Mage:</strong> Revive Cyberse a Cyberse.  <strong>Cyberse Wicckid:</strong> Can search for Bururu.  <strong>Linguriboh</strong>: Can negate a opponent trap.  <strong>Other Options</strong>  <strong>@Ignister: </strong>Gatchiri can be easily summoned in addition to protecting, Doshin can also be easily summoned, Earth Golem alongside Doshin and Fusion can work, Wind Pegasus has synergies with Bururu, A.I. Contact you can draw 3 cards to 1 copy is a fine card, FA.I.ghting Spirit I think it can be a pretty good card since it is similar to A.Idle Reborn but I did not have enough time to test it.  <strong>Cyberse Stuff: </strong>Scrypton is easy to summon, Lady Debug is a very good seeker, Mathmech Sigma is another easy monster to summon, Quantum Dragon is sometimes a better Synchro option, Primathmech Alembertian with more Mathmech may be ideal.  <strong>Going Second: </strong>The deck likes to go second for its OTK so some cards to go second can serve as Pankratops to easily destroy, Dark Ruler No More in any case (Although it removes damage), Forbidden Droplet to negate several cards.  <strong>Thing you should know</strong>  Easy Play: Summon Fire Phoenix quickly, use it as material for Accelerator and revive Fire Phoenix where it aims. It's an easy play to make that goes straight to the point.  With the above, A.I.dle Reborn can revive the big monsters like Fire Phoenix which makes this combo much easier.  Cyberse Accelerator is the one that has to aim towards Fire Phoenix, unless you can revive Fire Phoenix first Cyberse Accelerator is the first summon.  Dark Infant should not always be summoned first, it has an effect to move and allows 3 monsters to be summoned with Dark Templar.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> I think it will work out fine.  <strong>Monarch:</strong> Based on an old recipe I used, I updated it to be Banlist compliant.  <strong>Ogdoabyss:</strong> They're still there 0.0 .  <strong>Remakes:</strong> Best Fusion Deck: I honestly don't know what to do with him, Abyss Actor: Will be ready for August 3, Infernity Xyz: I've been having a lot of fun with him even though is soooooo bricky.  If you would like to see one of this deck, don't forget to comment, it cheers me up."

If you are not a budget player, you can change a lot of things (Like adding at least 2 Shuraigs and 2 other Fraktalls which I just can't find anyone selling around here), however, after playing Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade, I liked this deck so much that I tried to run other things on it. I'm uploading the current version of the deck which I have right now because I may change it with LIOV coming soon.  I don't like the barrier lock (this shouldn't be the win-condition of a Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade deck), even though it's here in the main deck, I usually side it out for something more useful or maybe the thunderbird since the deck doesn't need the normal summon that much.  The win-con is Tri-brigade oath in the GY with Apollousa + Simorgh + Apex Avian + Double Dragon Lords + Naturia Beast. Tri-Brigade Oath is one of the best cards in this deck because the main weakness is Dark Ruler No More which shuts down the board avoiding my monster negations. The way I've seen people keeping Oath live is usually by having Kerass as the beast monster on the field. He doesn't do anything in the opponent's turn, that's why I try I want Naturia beast.  I'll try to explain some of my choices. Feel free to disagree. Yes, 44 cards. I just refuse to remove any of the cards in the main deck (except barrier statue which I'll as soon as I get another Fraktall). I run a couple garnets which I don't wanna draw as often (when I do draw them, Ferrijit saves my day), and Reborn Tengu thins the deck.  -Harpie's feather storm is the best card in the deck. There's almost no scenario where I don't have a wind-winged-beast monster. And sometimes I keep Harpie conductor on the field to activate it from the hand. -Gamma is the best hand-trap for this deck since Fraktall, Rescue cat, One for One and Foolish burial are cards that must resolve, and are usually easy targets for Ash. -Reborn Tengu is good since he fills up the GY and keeps a body on the field -Fraktall is at one copy because I just can't find it. But since he's searchable through Nervall, I can always have him when I need. -Valerifawn and Mine mole are my targets for Rescue Cat when I want Naturia Beast, but when I've already used Cat, I can Ferret them plus any level 1 since I save Ferrijit special summon for them. Then I activate him under Simorgh or Apollousa. Valerifawn is the best beast level 2 earth tuner I could find, since I can use him to get back Kitt or Kerass, and Mine Mole helps me keeping card advantage while comboing off. -Ayers Rock Sunrise is a card I really like and I was trying to run more copies of it, however, I had to shave them since the deck is already 40+ cards. This card can be used as a specific monster reborn for Rescue Cat when the opponent activates infinite impermanence or veiler, since I can link it off for Almiraj and then bring it back to use its effects. I can do the same for Ferret, I can also bring Ferrijit or Naturia Beast back with it after linking them off. Sometimes the ATK decreasing comes in clutch. -Pot of Acquisitiveness is really helpful to recycle the monsters I banish and it doesn't minuses me. -Cattle Call helps me cheat out Link 3 monsters and get at least into a two-material Apollousa if I use it on Reborn Tengu to play around Nibiru. I'm not sure about more than one copy of it. -Number 64 is another target for the materials I get with Rescue cat since the token deals with problems that must be dealt with by battle, or it can be beast in the GY since I can link it and its token off for Ferrijit. -Daruma Doll helps me recycle some of the banished cards when I'm in a simplified game state and his backroll destruction sometimes comes in clutch as well. -Brigrand is in the side deck for matches against Dogmatika. The rest of the side is to deal with Winda and backroll decks."

I feel that at this stage of the meta most decks have stopped running answers to Maximus in the extra deck, so utilizing it properly can be an absolute hose vs some decks.  Super poly is backbreaking for breaking boards. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon being the target vs Dragon link and Dragoon decks, Raidjin vs Simorgh if it comes up, Augoeides for the mirror, and Shekhinaga vs the decks that spam earth - zoodiac especially  Lyna lets you extend shaddoll lines where you have 1 shaddoll and magistus to give you a useful link to link off your ariel and construct for, both lets construct add schism, de-clogs your board and searches ecclesia for if needed  Hand traps of choice are Droll &amp; Lock  - it's endss turns vs ther best decks - and ash blossom - always applicable. Called by the grave protects your own plays, and a single Fleurdelis give negation power from hand traps, and can be hard to play around even if you know they are there.  Only 2 prosperity as i find it Bricky in multiples as you really cannot afford to spend 9+ extra deck monsters, but finding the card selection is still very good.  Sideboard is very generic, nothing special or techy in it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Here the link to the banlist I used for this:  https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/March_2008_Lists_(WC08-VG)  It's meant to be pre Synchro. It will probaply  go only against Dark Armed Dragon Destiny HERO.  In a lot of decklists I looked at for inspiration from the Side ""Road of the King"" the players didn't play ""Magical Merchant"".  Is there a special reason behind this?  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day everyone!"

Bewitch your opponent's deck! UwU La magia de la sincronía será desatada! Hechiza el deck de tu oponente!

OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/vvip9anOD_4  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army: </strong>Nos da cualquier guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Envía a Cloak o Boots para traer a este último o a Brigandine respectivamente.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El Deck usa mill, por lo que puede ser vulnerable a Efectos Rápidos que se activan en Cementerio.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

On this deck profile, i will only be explaning my changes from the previous build.  https://ygoprodeck.com/golden-castle-gren-maju-revised/  &nbsp;  <span>Deck Changes</span>  The current build i'm experimenting with takes into account the additions to other decks and my thoughts on how best to deal with them, as well as having the potential July banlist and beyond in mind.  <span>Main deck</span>  -1 Eater Of Millions  -2 Nibiru  +1 Lancea  +2 Lightning Storm  With Drytrons likely to come back into the fold, and their ability to search Lancea in mind, i had to think of a way to reduce the chances of being stuck with a hand too banish reliant, while also retaining the decks function. The second Eater Of Millions was the easiest thing to cut as both Gizmek and Pot Of Desires are simply too neccessary to consider cutting. In it's placed I added a copy of Lancea. Outside of Dimension Shifter, my only real answers to a full Dinosaur board were Raigeki (providing Dolka was summoned and not Laggia) and super poly to take Ultinate Conductor Tyranno and Secure Garda off the field. Only 1 copy of Lancea is used, as Shifter is the primary hand trap i want to draw. I can draw Lancea after using Shifter no problem, I'll still likely get one more turn to go for the OTK, but I cannot use Shifter after Lancea as Shifter requires an empty grave.  Dinosaurs becoming more prevelant (especially with Scrap Raptor) meant that Nibiru being at 3 was also a bad idea in the main deck. As mentioned Shifter is my main go to hand trap because of it's sheer power vs the meta, and is just as brutally effective against Dino's as Lancea. After much thought i decided to swap out 2 of them for 2 Lightning Storm. This allows me to deal with more effectively with trap heavy Zoodiac Tri-Brigade, backrow and links such as Apolussa, Simorgh e.t.c.  Super Poly is still there to deal with things like Invoked/Dragoon/Dragon Link but is surprisingly effective against both Tri-Brigade builds and the updated Drytron;  Drytrons: Ultimateness/ Beatrice+ Megalith/Drytron Link= Mudragon  Tri-Brigade: 3 links = Almarduke. Easily done, especially as you can often bait your opponent into summoning the third link if needed by using Harpie's/Lightning Storm to force the opponent to chain Revolt. The opponent will likely do so as they can add a second Revolt to hand when Bearbrumm goes back to the graveyard. Handily gets around Barrier Statue too.  Extra Deck  No changes. Pain Gainer for a 4 material Zeus and something else may replace the 2 N'tiss if Dogmatika continues to drop in play. The extra deck is plenty flexible enough to keep them for now.  Side Deck  Droll is added over Phantazmay simply because it is stronger against more meta decks, especially now Drytron is back in the mix. I believe that Dragon Link will be hit on the banlist in some capacity also. Whilst still good against Tri-Brigade, I already have significant enough coverage against it that keeping handtraps specific to certain match ups such as Phantazmay, when a more blanket handtrap exists isn't going to be as effective going forward. Droll can also interchange with Ash in the main deck depending on how the post banlist format takes shape too.  A second copy of Nibiru and Lancea are in the main deck, that can be added depending on the matchup. 3 Twin Twisters purely because it's chainable to Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order but also offers extra backrow removal.  Feel free to like and comment your thoughts!  &nbsp;"
