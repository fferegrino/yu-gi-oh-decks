In MP2, use either your normal summon or your last Ojamatch to summon Ojama Red and special 4 other Ojamas from hand.  Once you have five monsters on board, you can summon Masquerena, Barricadeborg, then with the last Ojama turn it into Link Spider, link the Spider with the Barricadeborg into Verte Anaconda. Finally, link Masquerena with Anaconda for a 4300 Accesscode.  Since your grave has Barricadeborg, Verte and IP, special summon three DADs from hand and set Ojama Pajama to protect them ~11 times. Next turn, beat them down with Accesscode and triple DAD for game."

Since she is very casual (aka only likes this deck because she saw a melffy card) i tried to make it so it can protect itself a bit either from spells with Naturia Beast, from destruction with melffy hide and seek or if all goes wrong and the opponent attacks with a beefy monster then a Bye Bye damage should be a quick way to deal some damage at least.  It is also very simple since the biggest play is the monster destruction/spell trap removal with Kalantosa and use Obedience Schooled to make either Melffy Mommy and get the materials quick so every attack burns the opponent or make a synchro (Beast)  Again, not at all competitive, can get some surprise wins and could be a fun way to ge someone into the game"

The set up is quite simple All-Out Attack and Morphing jar 2... thats it any other critter you have on the field is a bonus. MJ2 Special summons a mon from your deck; A-OA forces every special summoned mon to flip into atk mode and declare an attack if possible. So long as you can keep hitting an MJ2 as one of your summons the loop continues indefinely and since everything that cannot be summoned is sent to the GY. it only takes a few hits of Morphing Jar (1) to destroy the rest of an opponents deck already near exausted from there use of cards like Desire and all their searching.  Destroy the field build the field then destroy it once more; thats what this deck is about at its core.

More friends on the field the greater t,Anzu=Tae was all about friendship; she herself was not much of a player so her decks were questionable at best. I am trying to correct this by showing a deck centered around swarming being enough even if the brute force is lacking.  Athena is the heart of the deck and its not easily gained; but once Big Sis Athena is on the field directing her Sisters in arms it all comes together. Athena's effect is that each summon of a fairy type causes 600 dam; once per turn she can tribute another fairy to summon a fairy from the GY. Fairy Archer is the best friend of Athena and she only shines when Athena is surrounded by many friends. Fairy archer is the other corner stone as she can inact some of the larger effect damage pushes in this deck. For each light fairy I think its 300 dam; she launches her Solar Ray some times but its only good for 600 per itself.  Once when using it against another of my decks I wanted to see how much effect damage was possible... well 6 light fairy times 900+ 2 or 3 summons for 600 each= 7200 damage and thats 1 Solar ray with all copies going its another 7200 more so unlikely as it is to pull off 10K+ effect damage is possible in one round; how much can you pull off?

The entire deck is a smoke screen so that you can set up for Chaos necromancer the entire time without being figured out. Then in one atk you end your foe.  The ""draw"" power in this deck exists and that is why Pashuul is in there. you give both to the opponent to draw 2 cards using that one Super Heavy Sam and then your foe has costly dead weight to use if they can otherwise they do not die in battle and inflict damage while in def.  The Sam strat is Benkai and Sword master based and simple drag other fields down to my level so I can bully them."

Exchange and Gift card and what not like that means I g,Do not worry this deck will provide enough bricks to build many a home; but this deck is about those times the stars align and your opponent is caught napping.  You see Black Garden ensures that monsters in the form of tokens can be summoned to your field as often as the other player wishes to provide them. and those tokens are both plant and Dark effect monsters. The majority of the deck is designed to defend and trade for better cards. But the side deck provides another strat where you can use some powerful fusions and make the other guy pay for summoning up a storm 300LP at a time with Coffin Seller.  Made for fun and slower games.

It is not intended for modern day play.,"This Deck is built to archive the old 2002 video game <em>Eternal Duelist Soul</em>. Deck #1 by SlimSleezy  <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> deck revolves around trying to stall until you can pull out your <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> through deck-searching. You do this primarily by using beat down 4 stars, or high defense stall monsters. In this case, this version of the deck is all traditional attack based monsters. However, you can get creative and add in high attack but improbable monsters that won't likely attack on their own, like <strong><a data-name=""Jirai Gumo"">Jirai Gumo</a> (</strong>2200ATK<strong>)</strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Dark Elf"">Dark Elf</a>(</strong>2000ATK<strong>)</strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Panther Warrior"">Panther Warrior</a>(</strong>2000ATK<strong>)</strong>. Keep your high attack monsters on the field while working towards your win condition. You don't necessarily have to attack, in fact, while stalling it may be in your favor to reconsider playing too offensive without your trump card ready. You can experiment with having defense cards in your deck as well. However, the difference between having 2000 defense or 1900 attack is so little that it's worth being able to steadily beat down the enemy while you wait.  You look for your <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Ritual"">Black Luster Ritual</a></strong> with <strong><a data-name=""Sonic Bird"">Sonic Bird</a></strong>, and you look for <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong> with <strong><a data-name=""Senju Of The Thousand Hands"">Senju Of The Thousand Hands</a></strong>. You then combine them with sacrificing two of your beat down stall monsters and ritual summon <strong><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a></strong>  It's a very primitive playstyle even for 2002,but it's actually quite fun. It's fast, and snappy, and within it's own meta it is very hard to keep up with. It has very limited card swap potential, most of the cards are mandatory for it work correctly."

However I can only recommend trying it against the other meta decks.  Also because of the new ruling with Sky Striker Ray working under Gozen Match and just because rivalry is a better card, I would change 2 gozen to 3 rivalry of the warlords.  Also if you have acess to any money stables like lightining storm I would recommend chaning the side deck accordingly.  I dont think there is much to say about the gameplan of the deck.

Your combo will start by trying to get 2 level 7 monsters on the board. This can be done with <a data-name=""Dark Magic Veil"">Dark Magic Veil</a> bringing out a level 7 from the GY, with <a data-name=""Magician's Souls"">Magician's Souls</a> special summoning a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> from the GY, or with <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> summoning <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a>. Once you have accomplished that, you can go into <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon"">Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon</a>. Using Arsenal Falcon, you can special summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Tribute Lanius"">Raidraptor - Tribute Lanius</a>. Use Tribute Lanius to send <a data-name=""Raider's Wing"">Raider's Wing</a> to the GY. Detach one material from Arsenal Falcon and special summon <a data-name=""Raider's Wing"">Raider's Wing</a> from the GY, then link summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Wise Strix"">Raidraptor - Wise Strix</a> using Arsenal Falcon and Tribute Lanius. Special summon another copy of either Tribute Lanius or Raider's Wing from your deck and Xyz into <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Force Strix"">Raidraptor - Force Strix</a>. Using Force Strix's effect will allow you to add <a data-name=""Raidraptor -  Singing Lanius"">Raidraptor -  Singing Lanius</a> to your hand and set <a data-name=""Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic Force</a> to your field. You can now sepical summon Singing Lanius and link away Wise Strix. Once you are done, use the Rank-Up-Magic to special summon Ultimate Falcon using Force Strix. Optimally, your end board is now Crusadia Astram + Ultimate Falcon with Dark Magician distruption during your opponents turn. </span>  <span>If you did not open a way to get 2 Level 7 monsters on the field, or you know your opponent can easily disrupt your path to ultimate falcon, you still have the Dark Magician path open.

The Synchro half is mostly about emptying the ED to fuel the Necomancer in the main deck; and Fenix is easy to summon with over a fourth of the deck dedicated to it.  Simply put you either get a play or the deck falls on its ass; it does not really have middle ground.

Her only attack deck is great at overwhelming opening hands when ,"Kodachi is what you might call a muscle brained and honest fool. She believes in one truth and one person and nothing else.  Yume is the person; and the truth is Atk is the only form of def that exists in a fight. So her decks contain weapons and those that wield them and going second is her only choice. Turn without a battle phase is a waste of time.  This deck is the version she starts with in my story. Harpy Girl and Souls of the forgotten are some of my signature cards with my characters if they have a purpose at all. Amulet of Ambitions turns my Lv 2 normys into dangerous threats against high level synchros or main deck monsters.  Benny is her ultimate atker as he gets one per equip on him his norm and a ""second"" with Twin swords meaning he can overcome a lot. one megamorph on a chainsaw is enough to overcome most threats.  remember with this deck attacking really is your only chance at preventing future threats so never hesitate."

More evil!!</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Good day ladies and gentlemen, today another remaster of another crazy inspiration I had months ago, but now totally (or almost) competitive . I present to you My Evil eye &amp; Evil★Twin deck!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>How did this come to be?</b>  &nbsp;  <span>Think about, the main aggressive core of each archetype is fiend, Evil★Twin monster locks you on fiend type  from extra deck… was natural (at least for me) to use these two archetypes together like best friends, to become  the most evil deck of my house!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>What is the point of playing this deck?</b>  &nbsp;  <span>If you like the gameplay of the Evil★Twin(summon one of lil-la or ki-sikil to summon one different of the one that you summon and go in the control aspect of this archetype) will love this deck, because Evil eye  is an extreme versatil and control deck as well . Serziel can seach   eye of selene and from there... mate... your opponent will be lucky if he’d have a chance to play . Now you can imagine how  these two engines would work together... Am I right?!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Downsides??</b>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is to normal summon reliant, because  Serzie for some reason can only search Eye of selene if she  was normal summon , and guess what?</span> <span>The  </span><b>Live☆Twin </b><span> can only active their effect if you control no monster on the field, becmo a little incosist . To mitigate this effect, Secret password and  Live☆Twin Home will be yours bests friends . Why? Let’s found about!!</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Starter:</b>  &nbsp;  <b>3XSecret Password;   3xLive☆Twin Home;  1xTerraforming; 3xEvil Eye Domain - Pareidolia: </b><span>if for any reason your first hand  be at least on of this card, you will have a good live playing in this game . </span><b>Secret password</b><span> can search your </span><b>Live☆Twin Home </b><span>from then you will be able to summon  any </span><b>Live☆Twin </b><span> monster  without wasting your normal summon . From there if you have  </span><b>terraforming</b><span>  you can  bring </span><b>Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia,</b><span> to finally use your normal summon and summon  </span><b>Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye, </b><span> to continue your play .  </span><b>Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia </b><span> can also recover any of your Evil eye monsters from you GY if were pop up by effect( even yours effects) . The perfect hand would be at least one </span><b>Secret password</b><span>  and a terraforming .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Live☆Twin Lil-la: </b><span> you can normal summon her and go in typical evil twin play with need . I recommend  bringing  </span><b>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost</b><span>  with her toeffect, from then  draw a card with your opponent  try anything naughty .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Live☆Twin Ki-sikil: </b><span>The same as Lil-la , you can bring </span><b>Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat </b><span> for later on .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3 Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye: </b><span>Her effect while equipped with Eye of selene is… outrageous, use as a machine gun! </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Extenders!</b>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost 1 Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat:  </b><span> both can be summoned easily by their own effect (if you control the other live twin for exemple .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Evil Eye Awakening:  </b><span> if you are low  in resource,  </span><b>Evil Eye Awakening </b><span> to revive any of your evil eye monsters or  if  you have Eye of selene on the field, you could even summon  Serziel or </span><b>Medusa, Watcher of the Evil Eye </b><span> to your field from  your deck .  Neat, isn’t it?</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Medusa, Watcher of the Evil Eye:  </b><span>to recover any evil eye’s spell from your grave .</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2 Evil Eye Reemergence: </b><span> this card can easily put a token (or 2 depending on Eye of selene) , on the field, helping even more the </span><b>Evil★Twin </b><span> link play , for example . It also provides a decent protection for your Evil eyes spell cards .  </span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Monster Reborn: </b><span>Free summon from my Gy . You can even steal a dragoon!! Cheers! (Remember to  give back his/her card , you thief!)</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1 Knightmare Gryphon: Evil★Twin </b><span>best friend .

Slow and sturdy as a turtle.,Yume is my character and the best way to describe him is Sasquatch size. He is 8'5 and built like a football player. His strength is so great that he has a phobia about his own power.  This terror of letting lose has caused him to become one that does not fight back with his strength but rather have a never fall attitude and an indomitable spirit.  His deck is similar in that he takes hit after hit not going down.  So rocks and holding off until he can one shot with Megarock dragon.  This version is his deck before the story starts and he begins journeying trying to save mankind.
