Since they send from deck to graveyard, that helps, thin out your deck, and gets more banish material for Double Pill for UTC or Overtex.

As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• Standard Metalfoes ratios (x3 <a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a>, <a data-name=""Goldriver"">Goldriver</a>, <a data-name=""Silverd"">Silverd</a>, <a data-name=""Steelen"">Steelen</a>, <a data-name=""Melcaster"">Melcaster</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Bismugear"">Bismugear</a>)</strong> - <span>Your core cards. Self explanatory. Can't play a Metalfoes deck without Metalfoes monsters. They all do the same stuff, the only difference is their Levels.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Baobaboon"">Baobaboon</a></strong> - <span>Free mulligan/hand fix, also free Metalfoes targets and a free Rank 3 on board. Works well with Cross-Sheep.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Red Rose Dragon is your 1 card <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a>. Roxrose Dragon is your searcher for the Red Rose and also its target.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Summoner's Art"">Summoner's Art</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a> searcher. That's it lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Igknight Reload"">Igknight Reload</a></strong> - <span>pretty much an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> and a <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a>, but better.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Counter"">Metalfoes Counter</a></strong> - <span>We can afford to play x3 of these because expect N/R only format to be slower compared to standard and we need as many search/consistency cards as we can get.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a></strong> - <span>Mithrilium being just a Rare is the reason why this deck is even playable, honestly. Orichalc is one of your offensive beat sticks.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></strong> - <span>If your Pendulum deck can afford to make Rank 7 monsters, then you have no reason not to play this neat free negate package. Meteorburst shuts down any damage step shenanigans or monster effects during the Battle Phase.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Scrap Archfiend"">Scrap Archfiend</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Nirvana High Paladin"">Nirvana High Paladin</a></strong> - <span>Nirvana High Paladin is more of a win more card, but still a strong boss monster and helps you OTK faster. Scrap Archfiend could be any Level 7 Synchro monster you want, it's just a bridge to Nirvana High Paladin.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 74: Master of Blades"">Number 74: Master of Blades</a></strong> - <span>A neat form of interruption/negation, especially in a format where <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> will definitely be a staple.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>A 2600 DEF body on board that has an interruption in the form of a replacement effect in response to an opponent's monster effect, your go-to monster from <a data-name=""Baobaboon"">Baobaboon</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Amalgam"">Heavymetalfoes Amalgam</a></strong> - <span>I'm actually considering bumping it up to 2, just because of the fact that it can destroy cards you control and it can either summon itself back or equip itself to a ""Metalfoes"" monster you control and boosting it up with 1000 ATK. It's not <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, but it's not as bad as most people think.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a></strong> - <span>Your two main ways of dumping <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> to cheat out <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a>. Cross-Sheep is a must have in any Fusion based deck that can swarm and Link Summon, and Gravity Controller is also a neat card, especially against monsters in the Extra Monster Zone that is hard to out.</span></span>  <span>Additional notes:</span>  <span>Also, honorable mentions in which I forgot to include are <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Magical Abductor"">Magical Abductor</a>, <a data-name=""Metalfoes Adamante"">Metalfoes Adamante</a>, <a data-name=""Firewall eXceed Dragon"">Firewall eXceed Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Defender of the Labyrinth"">Defender of the Labyrinth</a>, <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Powercode Talker"">Powercode Talker</a>. Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is a great omni-negate especially if you're playing the archetypal field spell <a data-name=""Metamorformation"">Metamorformation</a>. Adamante is just an additional 2500 body non-effect monster that would be great in case you plan on playing their field spell, that means he gets the benefit of its protection. Firewall eXceed Dragon works well with either <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> or <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, if you ever decide to play both of them, bumping it up to 4000 ATK potentially, but if you plan to do so, I highly suggest also playing <a data-name=""Magical Abductor"">Magical Abductor</a> as a bonus searcher, Pendulum Scale, and mainly an additional Level 4. Defender of the Labyrinth is our best Link 2 monster for this format, considering the fact that we don't have many relevant Link 2s with both downward left and downward right arrows for the purposes of Pendulum Summoning, apart from Cross-Sheep. Gem-Knight Pearl is also a great addition especially if you're playing Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Powercode Talker is another good alternative win condition since it's not only a good beater, but his effect to tribute a monster it points to also triggers both <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> and <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a>'s effect to replace itself or pop a card on the field, respectively.</span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>There's a lot of ways to build this deck. You could splash in x3 <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Delta"">Psy-Framegear Delta</a> (for Spell negation), x2 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Zeta"">Psy-Framelord Zeta</a> (for interruption and recycling), and a <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> as an easy way to either interrupt your opponent's Spells or make a Level 8 Synchro during your turn. You could also use <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a> to search <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> as a Normal Summon. You can splash in low rarity Kaijus as well for Mithrilium to bounce. If you're feeling spicy, mix it with some Yosenjus. Make it a staple city and it'll also probably work itself out. There's a lot of room for options when it comes to Pendulums, especially Metalfoes, and that's why I love it. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

The card allows for otherwise dead hands in prior builds to flourish and gives the deck a greater  degree of consistency, an expanded level of versatility, and allows for the creation of stronger first turn boards. I've chosen to utilize Dragoon over Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer given the Dragoon's ability to negate, the fact that it can facilitate the swift depletion of your opponent's field and/or LP, and the fact that Dragon Buster already has a quickplay banishing effect. The only problem I see is that both Dragoon and Dragon Buster require you to discard to activate their best effects. While my previous ABCDragoon builds utilized Mystic Mine over Pseudo Space, I've decided to go back to using the latter as it further bolsters consistency given a simple combination of Union Hanger and Pseudo Space allows you to build a suitable board with Buster alongside I:P or a Dragoon summoned by the Verte. The fact that both Dragon Buster and Dragoon rely on discards, something I saw as a weakness in the past, also means that it's beneficial that you can further increase your card advantage by engaging in shenanigans via playing Pseudo Space after already having activated and utilized Union Hanger's effects.  I'm still running a decent line-up of handtraps so as to increase one's ability to stand firm should one's opponent be going first. I'll always have a soft spot for the PSY-Framegear Gamma engine and am still running a copy of PSY-Framelord Omega given how devastating it can be for your opponent if you summon that card after negating a handtrap used against you on your own turn before you've summoned a monster.  I've been thinking over the extra deck but believe Borrelsword is a worthy addition considering how easy it is to summon when utilizing materials left behind by Epigonen's effect. It's allowed me to win on the second turn of a game in a situation where I would have otherwise bricked if I wasn't running Epigonen. Accesscode and the Knightmare package will always be stables in any Link-focused ABC deck, though, considering how easy it is to link climb into Accesscode, itself. Epigonen actually makes such a climb even easier.  Part of me is still considering the benefits of Lambda given how Nibiru can still be a problem should your opponent refuse to wait for Dragoon's summon, perhaps anticipating Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer or some sort of Brandish monster instead, without an Unauthorized Reactivation in hand to protect Dragon Buster. You can still summon a strong Appolousa on your first turn through Epigonen shenanigans if you know your opponent has Nibiru in their main deck or side deck.  I'm still tinkering with my own side deck, though, but I'm not so deluded as to think this deck is the best an ABC deck. that utilizes Epigonen, can offer. There's always room for improvement especially in a game like Yu-Gi-Oh! where the meta constantly evolves.  &nbsp;"

I'm torn as to whether I should keep Lamba in spite of that. Reintroducing Link Spider or Lyna the Light Charmer might not be a bad idea in Lambda's place. 'm also torn between Pseudo Space and Mystic Mine as I've been in  other recently posted ABC builds.

Not only is Electrumite legal but we also have access to Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom, so if you want to go for a pesky FTK then its fully possible.  With the exception of 2 Astrograph, 2 Chronograph, 2 Double Iris, a Darkwurm and a Harmonizing all of the cards which made Pendulum Magicians Tier one back in 2017-2018 is here, only one Double Iris hurts and the more Sorcerers legal the better but compared to the TCG this deck is far stronger.  The main aim of this deck is to get out Electrumite pre-Pend summon and win from there. Selene lets us play around Nibiru and aside from Droll, most common handtraps are nothing but a annoyance, sometimes Nibiru against a bad hand could end it or gamma on the Electrumite but as soon as Electrumite resolves we're most likely winning and thanks to the FTK potential you can even just ignore Maxx ""C"" unless your opponent draws into another handtrap or more so is best to ash/call it anyway.  This build is more geared towards going first for the FTK but if you want to cut the FTK package then maybe consider adding in a few boardbreakers like Evenly or DRNM.  One thought i had in i think a single Dragonpit Magician in here somewhere to out Skill Drain Exactly couldn't hurt but I'm not quite sure what to cut, possibly the Time Pendulumgraph since we only have one Double Iris and we aren't planning on going into the grindgame or even going past turn one if we can help it, although Time Pendulumgraph alsoouts Skill Drain so I'm 50/50 on that one"

After having played with various Gravekeeper's deck builds for months there is no doubt that the Field Spell  Necrovalley is the heart and soul of this archetype. Some Gravekeeper's deck builds focus specifically on trying to get Necrovalley up as soon as possible and trying to protect it at all costs. (In other words Necrovalley deck builds and not as much Gravekeeper's.) This Gravekeeper's pure deck build focuses on all that both Gravekeeper's AND Necrovalley have to offer.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck breakdown:  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Recruiter - ran at two because 3 is just too much. Gravekeeper's Recruiter is mainly used to extend into either Gravekeeper's Commandant to extend to Necrovalley OR if Necrovalley is already up on field (and depending on the situation) Gravekeeper's Recruiter can be used to extend to Gravekeeper's Spiritualist (if there are enough resources in hand or on field to then fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist) OR if there is a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist in graveyard Gravekeeper's Recruiter can be used to extend to Gravekeeper's Headman to then be summoned triggering Gravekeeper's Headman effect to then special summon Gravekeeper's Spiritualist from graveyard and then go into a fusion summon with Headman and Spiritualist to fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Nobleman - ran at 1 because having to rely on opponent having to attack is a drawback. Though it is ran at 1 this card may just be one of the biggest extenders in the deck. Usually Gravekeeper's Nobleman is used to help extend to any of the Gravekeeper's flip effect monsters. Depending on whether Necrovalley (field spell) is up or not really depends on what can be done with Gravekeeper's Nobleman. If Necrovalley is up on field then Nobleman's effect can be used to set a Gravekeeper's Spy to then be flipped and special summon a Gravekeeper's Shaman (Only if enough Gravekeeper's monsters are in grave to boost Shaman's defense) OR Gravekeeper's Spy can be used to special summon a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist setting up the field for a fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. If Necrovalley is not on the field then Gravekeeper's Nobleman can be used to extend into Gravekeeper's Recruiter to then get a Gravekeeper's Commandant to hand and then extend into Necrovalley OR depending on how many monsters are in the Battle Phase Gravekeeper's Nobleman can be used extend to Gravekeeper's Spy (Gravekeeper's Spy would be special summoned face-down because of Nobleman's effect) to then be flipped and further extend out to Gravekeeper's Recruiter and Recruiter then extending out to Gravekeeper's Commandant and Gravekeeper's Commandant extending out for a Necrovalley field spell. OR Greaveekeper's Nobleman can be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Guard to help bounce a monster off the field (Gravekeeper's Guard would be special summoned face-down due to Gravekeeper's Nobleman effect). Depending on how many Gravekeeper's monsters are in the graveyard Gravekeeper's Nobleman can also be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Shaman.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Headman - ran at 1 because of low stats YET a VERY strong extender that can help change a tied of the game. Gravekeeper's Headman's effect is triggered when either normal OR special summoned. Depending on the scenario and on whether Necrovalley field spell is up on the field Gravekeeper's Headman can be used in various ways. If Necrovalley is up Gravekeeper's Headman can be used to special summon a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to then fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist using both Headman and Spiritualist. OR Gravekeeper's Headman can be used to special summon any level 4 Gravekeeper's  monster from graveyard face-down. (Targets include Gravekeeper's Spy, Gravekeeper's Guard, Gravekeeper's Ambusher, Gravekeeper's Descendent, Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, Gravekeeper's Commandant, Gravekeeper's Heretic, Gravekeeper's Cannonholder, Gravekeeper's Assailant). If both Gravekeeper's Headman and Gravekeeper's Spiritualist are in the graveyard and a Gravekeeper's Chief is tribute summoned, Gravekeeper's Chief effect can be used to target Gravekeeper's Headman to special summon it then triggering Gravekeper's Headman effect to then special summon Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to then go into a Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Spy - Ran at 2. Gravekeeper's Spy helps set the board up depending on scenario.  Usually a Gravekeeper's Spy will be 2500 defense if Necrovalley field spell is on field OR if both Necrovalley Field Spell is on field and Necrovalley Temple is set this boosts Gravekeeper's Spy's even further (Necrovalley Temple reduces opponent's monsters ATK and DEF  by 500 as along as both a Necrovalley field spell is up on field and a Gravekeeper's monster is on field). This theoretically gives Gravekeeper's Spy a 1000 Defense boost meaning that even a monster with 3000 original attack would not be able to out Gravekeeper's Spy while in defense position.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Guard - Though a very strong card with the ability to bounce Gravekeeper's Guard is ran at 1 because it does not help further synergy the deck and board. Similar to Gravekeeper's Spy, Gravekeeper's Guard is difficult to out when both Necrovalley and Necrovalley Temple are up and active on field.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Cannonholder - VERY underrated card and ran at 1 because similar to Gravekeeper's Guard it does not help further synergy the deck. Is mainly used to inflict damage without having to attack. Mainly used to tribute Gravekeeper's Recruiter to both inflict 700 Damage with Gravekeeper's Cannonholder effect AND to trigger Gravekeeper's Recruiter searching effect. Depending on the duel  and opponent's life points sometimes a board/duel is locked and set up with various Gravekeeper's being in defense position. Gravekeeper's Cannonholder can be used to inflict deadly burn damage before OR after a Battle Phase.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Assailant - Run at 1 and mainly used to prevent opponent from gaining field advantage with monsters. Aside from Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist, Gravekeeper's Assailant is a very offensive card that helps clear the board 1-by-1. Gravekeeper's Assailant effect to be able to change face-up monster's battle position also helps get rid of monsters that have high DEF yet low ATK.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Commandant - In other words Terraforming on legs. Can easily be ran at 3 though I run it at 2 and here's why. There are various ways to get to Gravekeeper's Commandant as mentioned above AND because Necrovalley Throne is being ran at 2. Necrovalley Throne not only acts as another normal summon for a Gravekeeper's monster BUT can be used as a primary way to extend out to Gravekeeper's Commandant. Gravekeeper's Commandant is mainly used to extend out for Necrovalley field spell. Can easily be aran at 3 to learn the in's and outs of main deck by swapping out a Necrovalley Throne.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Descendent - Ran at 1. Mainly used to get rid of Spells or Traps. Can also be used to trigger Gravekeeper's Recruiter effect.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Ambusher - Ran at 1 - Depending on whether Necrovalley is up on field and whether opponent has a card in graveyard that has of benefit by being graveyard, Gravekeeper's Ambusher flip effect can target a card in opponent's graveyard and return it to the bottom of their deck. Not only that but if Gravekeeper's Ambusher is successfully flipped and sent to graveyard after being flipped face up Gravekeeper's Ambusher can add 1 ""Necrovalley"" card from graveyard to hand. (being Necrovalley field spell, Necrovalley Temple, Necrovalley Throne, Hidden temples of Necrovalley or Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley)  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Heretic - Ran at 1. A beast in itself when Necrovalley is up on the field. Gravekeeper's Heretic is unaffected by all other card effects as long as Necrovalley is on the field meaning that ironically Gravekeeper's Heretic does not even get the ATK/DEF boost from Necrovalley. Gravekeeper's Heretic is powerful because not only is it unaffected by all other card effects BUT by having Gravekeeper's Heretic up on field many of the other Necrovalley Spell/Trap activation requirements are met.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Spiritualist - Ran at 2. Mainly used to fusion into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist through various routs as mentioned above. Depending on cards in hand the best targets to fusion summon with Gravekeeper's Spiritualist are the higher level Gravekeeper's monsters (Gravekeeper's Chief, Gravekeeper's Visionary and Gravekeeper's Oracle because of Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist effect). When Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist is fusion summoned Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist gains x100 ATK/DEF equal to the combined levels of the fusion materials used to fusion summon. (This on top of Necrovalley field spell's 500 ATK and DEF boost).  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Chief - Ran at 1.  Mainly only tribute summoned if other Gravekeeper's monsters are in graveyard to gain the most benefit out of Gravekeeper's Chief effect. Can be used to extend out to Gravekeeper's Headman to then extend out to another Gravekeeper's monster AND/OR can be used to extend out to a Gravekeeper's Spiritualist in graveyard helping set up a board to fusion summon Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Shaman - Ran at 1 though truly a Gravekeeper's tank alongside Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Helps protect Necrovalley from being destroyed, helps prevent opponent from activating a field spell card, gains 200 DEF for every Gravekeeper's monster in your graveyard AND negates all monster effects that activate in the graveyards except ""Gravekeeper's"" monster effects. Is usually only special summoned through Gravekeeper's Spy effect after having multiple Gravekeeper's monsters in your graveyard. Can be tribute summoned as last resort to protect both Necrovalley and life points and to prevent opponent from activating monster effects from their graveyard. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Visionary - Ran at 1. Gains 200 ATK for each Gravekeeper's monster in your graveyard. Usually only tribute summoned after a couple of Gravekeeper's monster are in your graveyard. Can be protected from being destroyed by discarding 1 Gravekeeper's monster from hand which helps prevent it from being destroyed and helps boost ATK by 200. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Oracle - Ran at 1. Usually only tribute summoned to reduce all opponent's monsters ATK and DEF by 2000 though can be used in many various ways with its other effects. Only requires 1 Gravekeeper's monster for it to be tribute summoned though can use 2 or 3 Gravekeeper's monsters for tribute to resolve more of Gravekeeper's Oracle effects. Primary target for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist to fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist when in hand.  &nbsp;  Raigeki - Generic monster removal  &nbsp;  Royal Tribute - Ran at 1 though VERY powerful card if it resolves early in the duel. Can easily be ran at 2 by taking Field Barrier out.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Stele - Ran at 2. Very powerful in that it can bring back resources that are needed in hand such as Gravekeeper's Commandant to search Necrovalley OR if Necrovalley is already active Gravekeeper's Stele can help bring back Gravekeeper's Spiritualist with another Gravekeeper's monster to then fusion summon into Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist. Can also bring back to hand Gravekeeper's Recruiter to help search Gravekeeper's Commandant after Recruiter has been set or summoned and sent off field into graveyard.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley - Ran at 3. The heart and soul of a Gravekeeper's deck.  &nbsp;  Field Barrier - Ran at 1. Used to protect Necrovalley.  &nbsp;  Hidden Temples of Necrovalley - Ran at 1. Very powerful if its activation is patiently timed. Usually only activated after a board lock has been slightly established OR if Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist is on field alongside another face up Gravekeeper's monster. Can only be activated and stay up on field if both a Gravekeeper's monster and Necrovalley are face up on field. As long as Hidden Temples of Necrovalley stays up on field neither player can special summon monsters except ""Gravekeeper's"" monsters.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley Throne - Ran at 2. Can help normal summon 1 gravekeeper's monster in addition to the turn's normal summon OR can help search a ""Gravekeeper's"" monster from deck and then add to hand. Another extender to Gravekeeper's Commandant and is ran at 2 because Gravekeeper's Commandant is ran at 2. Can also help set up a board for Gravekeeper's Spiritualist depending if Necrovalley is up on field.  &nbsp;  Reload - Ran at 1. VERY underrated card. Helps free up an ""brick"" hand and can refresh a hand if different cards are needed. Can be ran at 2.  &nbsp;  Twin Twisters - Spell/Trap removal that is being ran to benefit Gravekeeper's Stele, Rite of Spirit and Gravekeeper's Headman.  &nbsp;  Rite of Spirit - Ran at 2. VERY useful in helping bring back ANY Gravekeeper's monster from your graveyard and is unaffected by Necrovalley. Very useful in bringing back a Gravekeeper's Recruiter or can also be used to bring back a Gravekeeper's Headman triggering Headman's effect to further extend and bring back another Gravekeeper's monster from Graveyard.  &nbsp;  Necrovalley Temple - Ran at 2. VERY underrated Gravekeeper's/Necrovalley card. As long as Necrovalley and a Gravekeeper's monster are up on the field Necrovalley Temple helps reduce opponent's monsters ATK and DEF by 500 in addition to Necrovalley already boosting Gravekeeper's monsters ATK and DEF by 500. Not only that but Necrovalley Temple plays a bigger role in a Graveekeper's/Necrovalley deck. During the Main Phase if there is no Field Spell on your field zone you can activate a Necrovalley from your hand or graveyard. (Meaning that if a Necrovalley was destroyed and sent to the graveyard during your OR your opponent's Main Phase, Necrovalley Temple effect activates which allows to to either activate 1 ""Necrovalley"" field spell from your hand OR re-activate the same Necrovalley that was just destroyed and sent to your graveyard). On top of all of this if Necrovalley Temple is destroyed on the field and sent to the graveyard (regardless of it being face-up or face-down/set) Necrovalley Temple allows you to set 1 ""Necrovalley"" Spell/Trap from your deck except for Necrovalley Temple onto your side of the field (Whether it be Necrovalley, Necrovalley Throne, Hidden Temples of Necrovalley, or Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley).  &nbsp;  Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley - Ran at 2. Pretty much this deck's Solemn Judgement. As long as both Necrovalley and  Gravekeeper's monster are up on the field Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley can negate a spell/trap of monster effect activation and destroy it. Usually only used when guaranteed that the card opponent is using is an attempt to out Necrovalley or an established field/board lock.  &nbsp;  Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist - Ran at 3. The tank and main protector of Gravekeeper's and Necrovalley. Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist has VERY strong effects that synergies with the whole Gravekeeper's Necrovalley archetype. When fusion summoned gains x100 ATK/DEF equal to the combined levels of the fusion materials used to fusion summon. (This on top of Necrovalley field spell's 500 ATK and DEF boost). As long as Necrovalley and Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist remain up on field, neither Necrovalley nor Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist can be destroyed by card effects. During the Main Phase Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist effect can be activated allowing to search and add either 1 "" Gravekeeper's"" monster or 1 ""Necrovalley"" card from deck to hand during that same turn's End Phase. A must at three since it is the only Gravekeeper's extra deck monster currently available.  &nbsp;"

Pend","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with the actual Metalfoes list that I'm supposed to be posting first before the N/R only Metalfoes, so I don't know what else to say but Fusion and Pendulum best deck, presenting Metalfoes. As per usual, the side deck will be filled with cards that you might want to consider but are not necessarily mandatory for the build.</span>  <span><strong>Why play this deck?</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite is legal, most importantly.</span></li>  	<li><span>Astrograph Sorcerer is also legal.</span></li>  	<li><span>No DPE, no problem. We still have Scythe lock access.</span></li>  	<li><span>It does not xeno lock you into anything, which means freedom for extra deck tech choices. (You'll be seeing me saying this a lot in this list.)</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Why not to play this deck?</strong></span>  <span>I honestly don't know any reason not to like playing this deck, aside from you having spite against Pendulums, I guess. But don't worry, it's a Pendulum deck that does not require much reading, if that's your main concern.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• Standard Metalfoes ratios (x3 <a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a>, <a data-name=""Goldriver"">Goldriver</a>, <a data-name=""Silverd"">Silverd</a>, <a data-name=""Steelen"">Steelen</a>, <a data-name=""Melcaster"">Melcaster</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Bismugear"">Bismugear</a>)</strong> - <span>Your core cards. Self explanatory. Can't play a Metalfoes deck without Metalfoes monsters. They all do the same stuff, the only difference is their Levels which can often be relevant.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a></strong> - <span>This is just a one card <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> or <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>. Your main normal summon.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> - <span>Pot of Greed, basically, that gets even better if you sent <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes Combination</a> for its draw effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Summoner's Art"">Summoner's Art</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Volflame"">Volflame</a> searcher. That's it lol.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></strong> - <span>Also another access to <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. Tutors out 9 of your Metalfoes monsters from the deck for free.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Combination"">Metalfoes Combination</a></strong> - <span>Your main fodder for Magicians' Souls draw effect, because it provides you a search by doing so, and it's not once per turn.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic"">Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</a>, <a data-name=""Mythical Beast Jackal King"">Mythical Beast Jackal King</a>, <a data-name=""Reflection of Endymion"">Reflection of Endymion</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a></strong> - <span>The first three are your usual <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> targets to be sent to the GY. Mighty Master is also a great negate on board as well as Jackal King, if you ever plan to play more copies of <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a>, it's also fine. Reflection is also a good form of non-destruction removal, as well as a good Level 7 monster alongside Mighty Master for your Rank 7 plays if you need them. Astrograph Sorcerer is your primary target for <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, it's a guaranteed Rank 7 monster on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Parametalfoes Fusion"">Parametalfoes Fusion</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Fusion"">Fullmetalfoes Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Metalfoes Fusion is a Fusion Spell that is also an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, also a great discard for <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>. Parametalfoes Fusion is your most important Fusion Spell, you'll loop this with your <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a>. Fullmetalfoes Fusion is what you'll be using to bring out <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Alkahest"">Fullmetalfoes Alkahest</a> during your opponent's turn as an added form of interruption, most of the time.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Counter"">Metalfoes Counter</a></strong> - <span>We only play 1 because we have access to more powerful high rarity starters.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Metalfoes Mithrilium"">Metalfoes Mithrilium</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Metalfoes Orichalc"">Metalfoes Orichalc</a></strong> - <span>Mithrilium is a great archetypal boss monster. Low rarity, has recycling effect, non-destruction removal, she also replaces herself, she's wonderful. Orichalc is a good support monster for the archetype, effectively turning your Metalfoes monsters into pseudo Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragons, he's also a removal upon getting rid of. You can bump either of them by 1 if you feel like doing so.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Fullmetalfoes Alkahest"">Fullmetalfoes Alkahest</a></strong> - <span>This card is wonderful. As per usual, it's a non-destruction form of quick-play removal and interruption, that also enables you to use your opponent's monsters as Fusion Material, provided that they're equipped to her.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></strong> - <span>If your Pendulum deck can afford to make Rank 7 monsters, then you have no reason not to play this neat free negate package.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Magician of Hope"">Magician of Hope</a></strong> - <span>It special summons a Pendulum Monster from your hand, it can place itself to the Pendulum Zone for an attack protection, it can attach a Pendulum Monster from your GY to itself as Xyz Material for the purposes of its effect, and most importantly, it can be Pendulum Summoned if you can Pendulum Summon Level 4 despite it being an Xyz Monster. It's also a 2500/2000 body on board.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a></strong> - <span>The main reason as to why a lot of people hated Pendulums apart from the fact that they can swarm so fast, and the reason why the first thing that comes to people's minds is ""does this enable/break Electrumite?"" whenever a new Pendulum archetype/support gets released. I really wish the TCG gets her unbanned already, in order for the Pendulum decks to see more competitive play. She places any Pendulum monsters from your Deck to your Extra Deck face-up, she fixes your zones/scales and is also a draw in doing the latter.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Amalgam"">Heavymetalfoes Amalgam</a></strong> - <span>He can destroy cards you control and it can either summon itself back or equip itself to a ""Metalfoes"" monster you control and boosting it up with 1000 ATK. It's not <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>, but it's not as bad as most people think.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a></strong> - <span>I cannot believe that this is legal in Master Duel. If you play in the TCG/OCG, you must already know about the ""Scythe Lock"", and if not, let me walk you through it. Artifact Scythe has an effect that if it's Special Summoned during your opponent's turn, your opponent cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck for the rest of that turn, and Artifact Dagda is a card that sets it from the deck, by simply triggering its effect by activating any of your cards' effect. We do not have access to <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (yet) in Master Duel, but the way people used to pop Scythe during your opponent's turn is by the effect of Tornado Dragon. If your deck can make a Rank 4, and it can easily bring out 2 monsters with different names, you got absolute ease of access to this package.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>This is purely out of personal preference, but it's always great to be able to have access to an alternate win condition. Other alternatives are Knightmare monsters or other Link 4 alternate win cons like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> - <span>It's a non-once per turn monster negate. You can also make her using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> during your opponent's turn, providing her with a protection against <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>What you'll usually be using to send <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> to the GY, since Absolute's effect to summon Vortex from the Extra Deck also triggers its effect to summon a Level 4 or lower monster from your GY. Useful when climbing to Selene or Apollousa.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  <span>This is not necessarily how you would side for this deck, rather than just a discussion for the other tech choices as I have stated before.</span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Qliphort Scout"">Qliphort Scout</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Qliphort Monolith"">Qliphort Monolith</a></strong> - <span>Gives you <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> access through <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>. A classic Metalfoes tech back in the day.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Crowley, the First Propheseer"">Crowley, the First Propheseer</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a></strong> - <span>Provides more draw power. If you wanna play more than 40 cards and more Endymion Pendulum monsters, feel free to use this as your Normal Summon instead.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a>, <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a></strong> - <span>The first two are just generic Rank 7 monsters, the former being a banishing extra deck and GY removal, and the latter being a non-destruction removal as well in the form of stealing your opponent's monsters, albeit both requiring targeting. Number 75 is always a neat negation for any deck that can bring out Rank 3s with ease.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>As I have stated before in my N/R rarity only Rose Metalfoes guide (here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/rose-metalfoes-master-duel-n-r-rarity-only/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/rose-metalfoes-master-duel-n-r-rarity-only/</a>), most Pendulum decks leave a lot of freedom when it comes to tech choices, and is seen by most people as just one big archetype instead of a summoning mechanic because of its toolbox-y nature. You could also play this deck with Pendulum Magicians and it'll probably work itself out just fine. This deck is one of the first Pendulum decks that I have learned to play and I'm glad that it's this one, because if I were to teach someone how to play Yu-Gi-Oh and have the need to introduce them to the Pendulum Summoning, this will definitely be one of if not my first choice, considering that it already contains a familiar mechanic in the form of Fusion Summoning in it, which is as I have stated multiple times already, my favorite summoning mechanic, and one that is not as taxing to learn compared to the others (with a few exceptions, of course). So that's that, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Before, both Squamata &amp; Hedgehog were at 3, but from testing I've noticed that it was a bit slow, so I cut them down to add more utility. At least we could still do the Shaddoll resource loop of Resh + Ariel/Falco + Hound. I'm actually considering playing 2 copies of both Falco and either Ariel or Hound for corner cases.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Magistus (x3 <a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Magistus Invocation"">Magistus Invocation</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Magistus Vritra"">Magistus Vritra</a>)</strong> - <span>This is one of our two ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"". I mean, it searches Invocation... Magistus Invocation. Hey, at least it's an Invocation that also uses monsters you control and not just monsters in your hand. Magistus Vritra is just a reborn spell. Before, this list also had Zoroa, but he serves no other purpose in testing but only as a beater.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Impostors (x3 <a data-name=""Beastking of the Swamps"">Beastking of the Swamps</a>, x2 <a data-name=""The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Goddess with the Third Eye"">Goddess with the Third Eye</a>, <a data-name=""Mystical Sheep #1"">Mystical Sheep #1</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Versago the Destroyer"">Versago the Destroyer</a>)</strong> - <span>Now this is the real cope version of Normal Summon ""Aleister"". At least we don't have to search for Invocation, because that's Rilliona's job, and because The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion acts as both the Fusion Material and the Fusion Spell. D/D Swirl Slime, before it was cool, and when it was slower. Also, I've cut it down to just 2, because it's only useful on established boards where you already have a Fusion monster. The other four is pretty much just here because they also act as names for the purposes of fusing for the Invoked monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Lunalight Black Sheep"">Lunalight Black Sheep</a></strong> - <span>This is as close as we can get to King of the Swamp, we need more access to Fusion Spells because our targets suck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>You need to see this as fast as you can.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Sinister Shadow Games"">Sinister Shadow Games</a>/<a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a></strong> - <span>Sinister Shadow Games is actually a better <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> for Shaddolls, at least. Paleozoic Dinomischus is a staple in every Trap Shaddoll build because it's a banishing removal and a WATER attribute for the purposes of our Fusion Summons. Before, this list also had Torrential Tribute, but this deck is too slow to recur back resources without Wendi. Trap selection is up for preference.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a></strong> - <span>The only Shaddoll targets that we have, aside from <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Wendigo"">Wendigo</a>, but we're not using her. Anoyatyllis stops every reborn effects OR just straight up kills Ritual Summoning, which I love because I hate Drytrons with a blazing passion of a thousand suns, and Wendigo is just a body on board that sits on defense position for us to stall out with or something.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Invoked (x2 <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Cocytus"">Invoked Cocytus</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>)</strong> - <span>The only Invoked targets that we have. <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> is pretty weak without <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, but it works best in tandem with Purgatrio, which can be equipped with <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a> if you want and just sit with it since it can attack all monsters your opponent controls anyway, mitigating your damage output but it works I suppose. Magellanica is literally just a big rock, so no. Augoeides and Cocytus are the two most worthwhile Invoked monsters to be summoned if I'm going to be honest, since Augoeides can both be good offensively and defensively depending on the board state, and Cocytus is just a cope Superheavy Samurai monster that is also a Towers. Sadly, <a data-name=""Power of the Guardians"">Power of the Guardians</a> is an SR, so the Purgatrio beatdown idea is not as strong.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit"">Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</a></strong> - <span>It's a 2800 DEF body <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a>, so long as the monster can be targeted.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Muddy Mudragon"">Muddy Mudragon</a></strong> - <span>One of our ""Aleister the Invoker"" copies. It's also a Fusion spell in itself.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker of Madness"">Aleister the Invoker of Madness</a></strong> - <span>He's here because he counts as ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"", and we need cards that can count as such for the purposes of Fusion Summoning our Invoked monsters.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>Staple in every Fusion deck. More bodies on board = more Fusion/Link materials. Sadly it's not as relevant because we don't have much good targets for Link climbing.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Battlin' Boxer Veil"">Battlin' Boxer Veil</a></strong> - <span>The Duel Links special. It's a hand trap that nullifies damage, so long as it's not lethal. It's a FIRE attribute that's only relevant because of Invoked Purgatrio. That's... really all there is to it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Invoked Magellanica"">Invoked Magellanica</a> </strong>- <span>For the reasons stated before, alongside the x3 copies of <a data-name=""Moon Mirror Shield"">Moon Mirror Shield</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Enlightenment Paladin"">Enlightenment Paladin</a>, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a></strong> - <span>The only relevant Synchro and Link monsters to climb to, in all honesty, at least in this event.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a></strong> - <span>Our cope version of <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>/<a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>. Also a SDSH special. (Although you could argue that this might be better compared to the latter two on certain occasions, but I'll leave that up for contention.)</span></span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>I do not know why for some reason, Konami made it so that all the DUEA archetypes have their most relevant cards all at SR or UR. I don't know if it's nostalgia bait or what, but it hurts for Shaddolls, not having access to either <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, or at least <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, or at least having one of the two relevant Fusion Spells between <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, or at least <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, in a low rarity event like this. Either way, I don't really expect this deck to perform as best as one might think, but it needs more testing, which you can't do in a ladder as cancerous as Master Duel's. Anyway, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Dinosaur real good?,"So the idea behind this one is simple, which is to be highly reliant on a mix of hand traps and trap cards backed by UTC, but with common Apollousa starts backed by the occasional Rank 4. The list emerged close to fully formed, this is a very ""feelsy"" Dinosaur deck rather than a meticulously crafted statistical engine. Some spicy tech is a pair of Token Collector, which combos really nicely with Lost World, but also provides a recurring way to kill Brave tokens and gut Auroradon's schtick.  No Kaiju, which is weird, but again, I have no explanation. This is literally a 40 card pile of cards I would want to run in Dinosaur, so I'm trying not to sully that.  Changed things up, mostly just down Extravagance and Solemn Strike and up Zefra Divine Strike, but also incorporating the Scrap package. The deck needs its extra deck more than the extra cards, but while space is tight I think it might be a good shell for Divine Strike, which IMO is actually kind of insane if you can make the extra deck space for it.  Kept the basic structure, but I'm above 40 cards now, to facilitate more babies, which was starting to come up. This does water down the Spell negates slightly, but seems to be working okay. It feels mostly like the same deck, except the combos can extend further sometimes.  Okay, so round 1 I ""felt"" it out, round 2 I bumped things up to see what I liked... Round 3 is when I did some maths, and made some hard cuts. So, I like this deck in this meta. Lancea is not that common, while it has some utility against Brave and DPE+Scythe, it isn't really as big a blowout, and Drytron isn't everywhere maining it. Scythe isn't free to play against, and I feel like there are some decks in this meta where that is basically true, but also the deck has a lot of plays it can make even if the Scythe goes off. NS Baby/Pill is hilarious against DPE+Scythe, provided you've answered the Brave Engine. Token Collector is already an insane combo piece in Dinos, but is also actually a hyper-relevant engine of a hand trap that reads ""FU"" vs Brave, and the deck has room for 15, count em, 15 interactive cards, with only a few minor sacrifices to get there. The basic idea is simple - decide whether to play around Nib or not, decide which Boss monsters to make, and then use them in tandem with interaction to narrow your opponent's lines of play down. Let's go through the card by card.  3 Lost World. So, back in the day, I thought this card was insane going second, but often unplayable going first. I've only sort of changed my mind about that - the protection from targeting alone is super clutch, there is no HOPT on the damn card, it combos off with a few cards just by itself, (including Token Collector+Dino). The card basically has 2 modes - going first it is either a complete waste of cardboard, or it just took over the game, THEN it is completely bonkers going second. Run this card. TBH I'd love to run a Terraforming, I think mathematically the 4 allowed copies works pretty well, but given the ratios of the deck at that point, and the ratios I wanted to run in the interactive suite, and the fact that too many Lost World can be bricky, it seemed like the 1 card to cut to keep everything where it needed to be. 41 cards actually fs things up a lot for where this version was going. This + Scrap Raptor is full combo, this + Oviraptor is full combo, it is insane with Scrap Wyvern in general, and my fave start for this deck is the occasional weirdness where you're using Accesscode Talker to pop a Lost World Token to start your actual Dinosaur combos (it does happen, and it hilarious), although I've since included Knightmare Cerberus to do that job quite well since that happened, so it is probably not a thing you'll ever do going first anymore.  3 Fossil Dig. So, these are effectively 3 more copies of all of your main Dinosaur combo cards and extenders, this is the glue that holds the combo together. I agonized slightly on whether to include 2 or 3 of these at some point, but I do think the full 3 copies are pretty close to necessary, even if it does open you up to more interruptions than some other starts - it does so marginally, and is otherwise the card that ties the consistency together.  1 Foolish Burial is effectively another copy of Misc, because Misc starts are insane. You give up the protection, but it does the combo, and realistically there are still a lot of great choke points when you Misc anyways, the important thing is specialing a Dino. It actually doubles as a third copy of token Collector, and in a pinch usually has something to send for value (usually Giant Rex, which sort of makes it a ""free"" extender, or a baby, which Oviraptor specials to extend combos, usually using the Scrap engine). But ideally, this is either Misc or Token Collector.  1 Misc. This is such an important card in the deck, it makes it very hard to interact with my Dinos if I see it in the hand. Probably more importantly, it specials dinos from the deck out of the GY, usually Archosaur to pop baby search pill, or else banishing itself and Archosaur to special baby, then use Oviraptor to pop baby (summon baby, summon Scrap Raptor, etc). The main card in the deck! Also, Sometimes this is Pankratops, and that's always fun.  2 Oviraptor made the final list. The math is like this - this is 7 copies of Misc I have to start my combos, just under a quarter of the deck, or rather a card I am very likely to open. There are also 5 copies of Oviraptor itself to start plays, counting the 3 Fossil Dig. That means I'm reasonably likely to see 1 copy, but reasonably likely not to see 2 - now consider that 3 of those redundant copies are actually full combo with Oviraptor, and that Oviraptor gets searched out by Archosaur + Baby, which is still full combo... But meanwhile, I'm pretty unlikely to see both actual copies of Oviraptor at the same time (and worst-case scenario, a back-up for follow-ups or to destroy with UCT is pretty sweet anyways) and I literally cannot clog on this card - there aren't technically enough copies. I did consider a 3rd copy for the grind game (sometimes, weirdly enough, full combo will use 2 Oviraptors even though the 2nd is bunk, killing followups) but mathemathically it really was a choice between Fossil Dig and Oviraptor, and the fact that Oviraptor x2 is not full combo and Oviraptor + Dig is makes things feel a lot better this way.  2 Token Collector have to make the cut. Honestly, it could be 3 in this deck, however, my mentality towards hand traps and cards in general with a HOPT has shifted - it isn't that I think they are bad, or would never run 3, but it seems like there's a glut of good interactive cards that exist in the format, and I'd rather run a pair of hand traps to do a job and know that I'm less likely to see multiples of the same hand trap, and this has actually even been increasingly true of my engine cards too, particularly when there are consistency cards I can run instead of my engine card. With Foolish Burial there are a lot of great Token Collector combo starts, and the fact that the card is often insanely live as a combo piece (sometimes even literally being the card that pulls a bad hand together) makes it do double duty. I think it is great to have this here with Brave being everywhere, and Auroradon still, y'know, existing, being present, and while I'm not convinced it should be a Dino staple, this format it puts in work being 2 of my interactive cards vs Brave going second (3 going first) and a good combo piece that's also a lvl 4 extender (and maybe STILL an interruption??). This mentality towards HOPT hands traps could shift, but I think it would take Maxx ""C"" or something equally as powerful and centralizing to do that tbh.  I'm running 1 Ash because I heard 1 Ash = GG.  Okay, okay, this is card #3 vs Brave engine, which is what I'm maining for. It makes the cut because it is flexible, and because I'm trying not to run too many HOPT cards next to each other.  Ghost Ogre is actually good right now, which makes me a liar, because I swore Ghost Ogre was just always bad. But it is good - it can help answer Gryphon Rider and Adventure in a great way and has some actual utility against a lot of the engines these Brave DPE decks tend to merge well with. Also weirdly good against a lot of the Rogue decks that might have a chance of countering this Meta, since many of them have either a Field Spell or a Continuous Spell or Trap that they use to game the system. It definitely helps that against ""The Meta"" it is THE thing that does the job, and that against the Rogue decks that actually stand up to the Meta it still does work. Ofc you still can't count on it to singlehandedly win you games the way some higher impact cards can, but it also is just the best at what it does right now.  1 Called By was always making the list, but I'm being a cheatyface and pretending this is a good answer to DPE+Scythe. If you're worried about the Scythe lock it can do work, and it can also catch out DPE (assuming you dealt with the Gryphon Rider) or even in some sitchs be the way you keep Celestial from helping them outgrind you, so it does have applications. But also, the card is just nuts in general, and obvy ends up being a great way to answer hand traps going first (which is why it is kind of cheating to think of it as a tool against DPE+Scythe engines - you'll often use it on something else first!)  1 Cosmic Cyclone is also coming in on the basis of being a DPE + Scythe card, and it does technically keep the Scythe lock from going up. But it makes the cut over something more obvious like Effect Veiler for being a very good very specific out for problematic Spells/Traps that TECHNICALLY has utility against DPE + Scythe. Funnily enough, it has utility against Adventures too, which makes it kind of a nice bridge between the two suites.  3 Imperm is 3 Imperm. The card is obviously nuts in general, this is one of those hand traps that always makes my decks even when I'm not too keen on running a lot of hand traps. But also, in this meta, you can hold one copy for Verte or burn an extra on Dagda, or even hold onto it for your turn and use it to push through your board. The fact that it isn't a HOPT, as well as the silly stuff you can do with the spell negate, at least on occasion (even if they never play into it, I can set it where I want, capiche?) makes it something between a staple and an all-star (and I'd argue they might even want to consider semi-limiting it, it sees at least as much play as Called By did back when they limited that). These are copies 3-5 of the anti-DPE package.  So, we have 5 ""Solemns"" and 2 of them are Judgment, and 3 of them are Zefra Divine Strike. Divine Strike is basically just Strike stapled to Judgement, except you can't negate summons, and it costs a space in your extra deck... Sign me up! These are primarily here to answer Spells and Traps, particularly blowout Spells and Traps, but also particularly Countertraps. Divine Strike is well worth running over Judgment, it can end chains the same way Strike can while also answering Counter Traps and Spells - freaking wild, and well worth the 3 spaces in the Extra deck. It does mean no Extravagance, but TBH I've had some serious problems with Extravagance in Dinosaur for as long as I can remember - I dunno, I feel like Dinos needs MOST of its extra deck, and then has a FEW extra slots it doesn't need, but randomly banishing Secure Gardna and seeing a low-end UCT you can no longer make feels bad, and that kind of thing happened to me in Dinosaur a lot with Extravagance. Regardless, my approach was to pile on spell negates, pretty reasonable since Apollousa is the main boss monster we're trying to make, if only to bait out the Nib, and we're running Imperm. Still, that both of these flex as answers to Monsters as well as ways to end chains and respond to Countertraps make them a sweet suite.  2 Archosaur and 2 Pill is pretty standard. It is pretty simple logic - you would run 1 of each, but if you see the first copy of either your combo would often get killed and/or gimped in that case, so you run 2 of each, which works great actually, because Archosaur + Baby is full combo, and Baby + Pill (or even Archosaur + Pill or Archosaur + dino) equals an easy cheesy UCT. I actually love these numbers given the little packages of 5 (1/8th) the deck creates because, oh, look at that, 3 Dig + 2 Archosaur = 5.  Holy Babycerasaurus Batman! Yep, I'm on all 3 Babies (+1 Petiteranodon). There's some reason for this. It largely does, in fact, boil down to the card not being a HOPT. In your usual combo, what I typically call ""full combo"" you'll use up either 3 babies, or 2 babies and 1 terano. That means, really, you only need to run 2 babies and 1 terano to do full combo. And in terms of starting hands, 2 Babies, 3 Fossil Dig and 1 Petiteranodon for the ""mini"" combo is actually acceptable, to say the least. It may even be better, at least in some ways, since you can NS baby and pop baby in hand for some of your combos, but the third baby is just UCT bait. But the deck summons babies from the deck like wild, it pops babies in the deck like wild. A 3rd baby is the difference between access to Pank and not. A 3rd baby is the difference between 2 Lost World being redundant, and 2 Lost World being freaking wild. A 3rd baby just in the deck sometimes is all the difference. Also, having all 3 Baby when Baby is needed for most of your combo starts does slightly improve the number of hands that combo off. It also slightly increases the general ""brickiness"" problems created with some hands (For instance, it makes possible the 5 ""baby"" hand, and while that is an extreme case, 2 babies and 3 hand traps remains sad) but I think the trade-off is quite acceptable considering the utility this offers you during your main combos. Giant Rex is the ""unnoficial"" baby. This guy makes Rank 4 Xyz plays and Lvl 8 plays possible mostly, but is a decent little beater in his own right, and you're basically choosing between this guy and Petitteranodan at the end of your main combo, depending on the rest of your plays and your matchup.  The Scrap engine is here. Scrap Raptor is a Dino and can be summoned off of any baby (including terano). It can pop itself to instantly make Scrap Wyvern, which in turn can extend your plays by popping babies, or even better, popping Lost World tokens to pop babies from the deck. It can also just pop a baby by itself before going into Wyvern - Wyvern pops Raptor, Raptor searches Chimera, NS Chimera, Summon Raptor, BOOM Rank 4 Xyz. With a little work this can also help set up Omega, and with Apollo you can force Nib while enabling UCT, meaning if they Nib early it might not be enough, but if they Nib too late they've just given you a lot of free advantage. Also, just nutty going second. Raptor + Lost World is a great combo by itself, which weirdly enough really helps the deck by creating more Dinos that just straight combo with Lost World by themselves.  2 UCT, 1 Pank. What is there to say? UCT is like, the main point of playing Dinos, especially right now. Pankratops seems a little weak this format, but the card is always insane, just generically, and this is Dinosaur, where free Panks from the deck are just, like, always on the table. I want more Panks, quite badly, which is probably a good sign this is a good limit.  In the extra deck, we have 3 Zefra Metaltron. TBH this just enables our Strikes, but you will occasionally use Metaltron as a stepping stone for Apollousa and Accesscode, and oddly enough, the banish ability is actually pretty relevant, since the deck can flood the board. However, in general, don't summon this card, unless you really have to - this is a brick for Divine Strike. If you just, like, run 3 Judgment and tech in stuff like Red Reboot and Feather Duster you'll make back all of those points against Trap decks, but lose a lot of utility against generic board breaking spells, as well as the ability to end chains. Solemn Strikes could end chains as a replacement for these as well, but again, you lose points against Backrow and Sweepers. Mind you, don't feel married to 3 Divine Strike if you have other tech calls to make (main or side). There's every chance that Ice Dragon's Prison and I:P is better in your meta - but consider this - Divine Strike really does do the better part of both of the best Solemns.  Scrap Wyvern is nuts, this is the main combo engine of the deck, the Needlefibre as it were. This is the broken Link 2 that pulls it all together going first, AND pops cards going second. I actually forgot this one in the feelsy list, but by the second attempt it was in.  1 Unicorn. I like Unicorn. Wyvern into Unicorn into Accesscode is just... Really good. Especially if you made an Almiraj somewhere.  1 Knightmare Cerberus. This one is... Weird? But I kept running into situations where I simultaneously wanted a generic way to pop a Lost World token and a way to discard, and this is that. Also, under Wyvern it draws a card, so that's neat. This could really be Tornado Dragon or Phoenix if you're expecting a lot of Eldlich or Geist or even backrow heavy versions of other engines, and those might be better at the rogue level for locals. But Cerberus is still an interactive card most of the time, and is also a weird consistency card in this deck. It's a lot easier to make a Cerberus to start combo plays than Accesscode after all.  Apollousa. Just a way to make sure you bait the Nib, make the Nib math hard. Also, I've heard it negates monster effects sometimes. Bagooska will help this not get beaten over.  Accesscode. What is there to say? If I'm going second, I want to pop a bunch of cards and beat in for game.  Evolzar Laggia is the only Evolzar to make the cut in the deck. Dolkka is better in terms of pure value, but this deck actually specifically needs ways to negate Spells and Traps a lot more than monster effects, so Dolkka seems redundant, whereas this is just good insurance.  Bagooska is great. Go you drunk animal, go! I'm fond of this card with Apollousa, but I'm also fond of this card going second to really force people's hands. Don't make this with Token Collector or Giant Rex tho, unless you really need to.  Abyss Dweller is Abyss Dweller. Not only is it generically quite good right now, it adds to the complexity of the simplified game state, or to put in another way, it reduces the lines of play opponents have to make in a situation where their lines of play are already limited by other factors. Also, UCT can eat it pretty much right away, and in a pinch it can even send something like a Giant Rex to the GY right away to help extend while creating a floodgate effect. Obviously, its utility will vary by matchup, but I like that it does some work against both of the ""main"" engines this format, for obvious reasons.  Almiraj and Linkuriboh are here to make a bunch of easy cheesy UCTs and fill the GY with Link monsters with different attributes. Summon Kurbioh or Almiraj early and often, before summon 5 if you can, to help ensure Pill isn't trash.  Omega is a grind game card. If your opponent's plan is to burn down their hand to disrupt you, making Omega becomes more appealing, but weirdly enough the best thing about the card is recycling Misc. Also great with the Gamma in the side. This is the card you use when you're pretty sure you can simplify the gamestate and live the turn, but aren't sure if your board will be broken. For example, against Tenyi and Swordsoul cards, you might be really hard-pressed not to end up in a pretty simplified board state no matter what, or against Prank-Kids as well, or against Rank 8 Spam. Sphere Mode is going to hurt, and there's no way of getting around it. Even weaker, grindy stuff like Salad might just keep you from making much aside from UCT and then just set up for the long haul. But limiting your opponent's options, setting yourself up for recovery, and knowing something is coming back at the start of your turn? That's priceless.  Side deck is wild man. Okay, I wanted more Cosmic and 1 Reboot, and that is pretty standard for me. But I decided I didn't really need Evenly, and I'm really not feeling it right now. Instead I decided to pile up on 2 ofs of hand traps, all chosen on the basis that they have some utility against Brave, DPE, or Scythe (or more than 1) while also being blowouts depending on the engine run with Brave, DPE + Scythe. At that point, I was also running all of the hand traps that scare me, including literally Ghost Ogre (wait, that's not correct is it?). So, I decided throw in 2 Gamma, which is half-decent as an anti-handtrap card in this deck sometimes and is also insane going second a lot of the time, and 3 Crossout, which now has amazing targets, including Gamma, for 5 more anti-handtrap cards to go with Called. I also included 1 Driver, because Gamma deserves a friend, and Gorramit I do too!  I'm an idiot, but a smart one. Solemns in, reading the card explains the card! XD"

Epigonen already provides a lot of versatility and consistency. Having a copy of Emergency Teleport in hand, while running PSY-Framegear Gamma allows for one to go an extensive combo so the have a decent starting hand consisting of Union Hanger, an ABC piece, or some other combination. This combo relies on one going into Coral Dragon and then into Baroness. By popping a summoned Platinum Gadget with Baroness, you can then special summon Gold Gadget to summon another ABC monster from your hand to go into the like of either Verte or I:P. If you start with Epigonen, as well, you can end up with both Verte and I:P, allowing for you to summon Destroy Phoenix Enforcer which you can then use to pop Verte, itself. I typically detest bloated ABC fields which stop Dragon Buster from tagging out which is why I prefer running DPE rather than Dragoon here. Besides, Baroness has the capability to negate by itself.  I'm also running Mystic Mine here since the combination of Coral Dragon, Baroness, Dragon Buster, and DPE should give you plentiful means to pop it should you be forced to give it to your opponent as a result of Set Rotation.  Still, I should once again make it clear that this ABC build is extremely experimental and is constantly being adjusted. The number of soft garnets in the deck is room for concern so I'm not sure if having more than forty cards in the main deck is necessarily a bad thing but do have other variations of this which run less than forty-two cards in the main deck."

Added deck strategy.  A flexible deck, every other duel you could draw the cards needed for invoked summoning, or shaddoll summoning. Either work very well, or if you're lucky both.  Invoked strategy: You draw an aleister the invoker? Normal summon, and add invocation to your hand, you link summon Artemis the magistus moon maiden, and then fusion summon Invoked Mechaba using Invocation.  Dogmatika/Albaz strategy: I use dogmatika and albaz for a monster negate and monster removal, useful for monsters that cant be destroyed by battle or card effects. I use albaz to tribute opponents troublesome monsters. Dogmatika monsters have OTK potential, and could be used as fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct and Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll strategy: You want to efficiently use your flip monster effects here, Reeshaddoll Wendi is a great card and the most aggressive. Ideally you would want to get Winda out there as a special summon limiter. Shaddoll Schism is your ace in the hole, you will want it in a long game.  My thoughts: I like to run 3 Cosmic Cyclone here because Skill drain is such a terrible card to encounter. And 3 Crossout Designator because I was sick of my opponents always playing handtraps, both have been good additions.

I made this decklist inspired in another one really similar from the Public Decks in the MD Deck Create room, and it showcases that D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kali Yuga is a real problem if the combo made to summon it to the Field isn't stopped properly, just like many other cards in the cardpool (Herald, Rhongo, etc., you can figure the rest).  The problem is, this deck can make the full combo that stops your opponent for entirely playing the game alongside getting 8k+ damage for the turn 3 with only 2 specific cards or any 3 card combo that can leave Force Strix + ANY DARK EXTENDER. Obviously, you need to play uninterrupted, and that's why the deck is equipped with a full-on Crossout Designator package that includes Ash, Nibiru, Infimp, Maxx ""C"" (at 3, that card may be the best card in the entire game period) and Called by (which you obviously want to see in your opener too). 5/40 cards are there to stop your opponent from stopping you, since you can't make full combo and also get a negate before the 5th summon, and Nib absolutely screws your plans.  Anyways, Tribute Lanius (or Summoner Monk + Spell for that matter) + Raider's Wing is full combo. Normal Tribute, effect to send to GY, send Mimicry (the one you never want in your opener), Mimicry effect in GY to search Pain Lanius, Pain effect to summon itself paying 400 targeting Tribute, XYZ summon Force Strix, search Singing Lanius, Raider's effect to summon itself detaching from Force, Singing summon itself because you have an XYZ monster. You now have 3 monsters in the Field and 3 cards in hand.  Link summon Wise Strix using everything but Raider's Wing (to avoid banishing it in any case the combo fails), summon from the Deck any Raidraptor (here you want Mimicry if you couldn't mill and search from it before), XYZ into another Force Strix, search literally anything and activate the 2nd effect of Wise to set a  PK Rank-Up Magic Force from the Deck (you will clearly be activating it this turn). Notice you will be keeping the last 3 cards in hand, and you now have a searched card from Force. If you opened a copy of Strangle Lanius, don't search it specifically, you will be summoning one from the Deck later, and also it locks you into DARK monsters, which you want to avoid if your opponent disrupts your next play.  Next, bring out Rusty Bardiche leaving the XYZ monster with 1 material (and that makes a lot of difference, it truly matters), then Rusty effect sending Boots to the GY to set Shade Brigandine. You don't want to set the RUM Launch (specially going second) to avoid any S/T destruction your opponent may have. Boots effect in GY next banishing itself to search Launch. If everything goes as planned from here, you won the game 99.99% of the time.  Activate RUM Force targeting Force Lanius and summon Arsenal Falcon, it should keep 2 materials. Arsenal effect (leaving Force Strix as material) to summon Strangle from Deck, and activate its effect to bring back any LV4 Raidraptor from the GY. Here, overlay the 2 LV4 monsters you have to XYZ summon Gagagaga Magician in a zone Rusty points to, to prock Rusty's destruction targeting Arsenal Falcon. If Arsenal has a ""Raidraptor"" monster as material, when it's sent to the GY, he will bring out Ultimate Falcon and attach itself as material. Inmediately after, detach from Ultimate to lock your opponent out of monster effects but, most importantly, getting Arsenal to the GY.  Last but not least, activate Gagagaga Magician's effect to bring back the Arsenal Falcon from the GY with no XYZ materials, and if you're going first, you can perfectly pass from here before setting the Launch. As soon as you're allowed, activate said RUM Launch to summon Kali Yuga on top of Arsenal Falcon, and anything your opponent did and does in/after the chain you're summoning Kali Yuga will be negated. Your opponent can't play the game really (Kali Yuga's Azathot like effect procks instantly and last until the end of the turn), and you have 2k + 3.5k + 3.5k + 2.1k damage (well over lethal) and a Quick-Effect Harpie's Feather Duster.  This painful combo happens quite consistently and with the correct cards, your opponent will need 3 interruptions to make it unviable. Your backup plan is UDF to negate and steal, Zeus if you're going second and can't OTK, or most likely if you lost the coin toss, Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon, summonable with Raider's Knight.  Even if you can't full combo, almost always the deck can end on a Arsenal Falcon that needs to be banished or bounced in order to avoid its floating effect to bring an inmune 3.5k beatstick that can shut the opponent down from monster effects, burns and decreases attack on top. But anyways, Force Strix + a DARK monster (considering you haven't used Raider's Wing effect to get there) is full combo uninterrupted, and you can play from there really.  Never banish 6 from Prospy. You always want to banish 3, and in my consideration the cards you for sure don't miss if you get out of your EX are Zeus, one Force Strix and one Gagagaga Magician. The rest is quite important. Maybe the UFD package is missable if you're going 2nd and can't OTK through Prosperity, but consider your options.  A board going 2nd with Rusty, Ultimate Falcon, Gagagaga Magician and Arc Rebellion has 10600 ATK. OTKing the turn you used Prosperity is viable, but you need your opponent having some monster(s) on the Field.  Kagetokage and Curtain Riser are in the deck as a XYZ enabler post and pre Normal Summon respectively. And you don't really need Shade, but any extender is welcome in this combo festival.  Important note, if you can full combo going 1st to get to Kali, Maxx ""C"" is not a problem really, considering you have ways to stop Ash and Nibiru specifically (e.g Called by and Crossout, both of them), so, if in your opener you have full combo + the 2 anti-handtrap measure cards, your targets should be those 2 and not Maxx ""C"".  Considering Prosperity is a HOPT (and thank God for that) and that this decklist plays 3of, you may want to replace one copy of Prospy for an Effect Veiler or a Ghost Belle, to make sure you have enough Crossout targets. I don't recommend it, but it's viable.  The deck is not really fun to play in the long term, nor cheap, nor interactive in most cases, but it wins, it wins a LOT, it isn't a pure coinflip (since you have your contingency plans or cards specifically made for going 2nd such as Droplet, Zeus, Arc, LS or Duster), it's somewhat versatile (even if the best it can do is the full lockout I explained before) and, in my experience, most of my opponents didn't know when to interrupt it correctly (the best disruption window is CLEARLY the Wise Strix summon, even more if you can destroy it with a Gamma for example). But most important, 7/10 times the combo goes off (or is for sure going off and the opponent knows that) the surrender is inmediate and you almost feel you made your opponent lose their time. So take that in mind if you decide to run this abomination."

Focusing on playing a pile of extender with just the right ratio of hand traps to open with 80% chance 1 and with 50% chance 2 with the other cards being extender.  The main goal of the deck is to set up sphere + 2 negates or Auroradon + 2 negates and a set up gy for the next turn if you went first. If you went second you usually can push straight for game against most boards.  &nbsp;  The spice lies in having the new meteor dragon as a way to loop black metal dragon into Ravine + Sphere while only using your normal summon and combo from there into either Sheou + Savage or go all out into Auroradon.  The deck takes some time to get used to to play but rewards you with plenty of lines of play even through negates and you will rarely stand there without interaction durring your opponents turn, if you go second or first.

Also more fun to play and bann list safer,"Alright, there are two reasons why you are here and not looking at tournament decks. Either you bought a full Swordsoul core and not want to spend more money just to swap to the new hot stuff that gets banned soon and now search for a way to keep playing the expensive cards you got OR you have no patience for Punk dia note and want to play this Amazing ( dragon ) archtype already.  Oh boy I got just the list for you. This deck does just what adventure tenyi rose dragon swordsoul ect. Does but cheaper and with a bit more explosive plays that catch people by suprise. The downside is a slightly higher brick chance ending with to many hand traps / traps. So if you dont mind that every tenth game, than this deck will still be something for you.  So lets go into this card by card followed by some combos.  First of all the classic cards :  3x Red Rose Dragon  1x Roxrose Dragon  1x Basal Rose Shoot  3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara  3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna  3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda  This is the most classical part of the deck. The main thing about it, is summon a big tenyi , summon red rose dragon , make baroness than use the rose dragons to go into Halq which is protected by Baroness omni negate. There are other ways to make this but this is the most simple version and usually the safest.  The Swordsouls:  1x Swordsoul of Mo Ye  1x Swordsoul of Taia  1x Swordsoul Strategist Longyuan  You rarely want to open them as they require a other card in hand and your normal summon, Long is probably still the best of the bunch to burn and make Baroness but usually you want to get to them later in your combo.  The Punks :  3xNoh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune  2x Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin  1x Joruri-P.U.N.K. Madame Spider  1xJoruri-P.U.N.K. Dangerous Gabu  3x Emergency Teleport  Iam gonna include Etele as punk here even though you can also summon Ogre of it. But the punks are basically 1 card Halqs / replace the Rose dragons when it comes to make a Baroness without normal summoning. Madam spider also spins use a nice little negate to hand for time win / discard fodder/ or simple negating stuff. They allow us to either set up a safer enviroment for our combo / play through negates / bait hand traps and make sure carbogeddon gets to gy. Including Ghost ogre we also have 3 names for Amazing Dragon which is really Amazing to have when playing Amazing Dragon  Spice like mayonaise :  2x Carboneddon  1xFlamvell Guard  1xAlexandrite Dragon  This is a new combo piece that recently came up in a few lists. You have a few more normal monsters that allow you to use the tenyi effects in gy and sending / discarding Carboneddon allows you to also get free extender material. This also makes Carboneddon a 1 card halq through Almirah. See ? Salamangreat are still good and playable. Just dont play the bad cards lmao  1x Deskbot  Its deskbot. you love him you hate him Konami will take him~  1x Fairy Tail - Snow  Send it somehow to gy and just loop it while your opponent asks themself why this card came of the list while you agree followed by asking for response knowing you just ruined their day &lt;3  1x Foolish Burial  Sends carboneddon/ Snow to be live or any tenyi you wanna use.  Hand traps :  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  2x Effect Veiler  3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit  3x Nibiru, the Primal Being  2x Forbidden Droplet  2xInfinite Impermanence  Basically you will see to 80% one of them and to 50% two. It helps your even weaker boards to usually hold the game in your favor and going second will make the board of your opponent soft enough to crack.  1x Swordsoul Blackout  Blackout pop 2 or banish to extend. Nothing to interesting to see here. Its as blant as its rarity.  Extra deck :  1x Baronne de Fleur  the card protecting Halq basically and one of Konamis meanest jokes to push display sales  1x Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing  Spins cards back to deck and extends afterwards, would love to play 2x  1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi  Just to push for games, can probably cut it for Baxia  1x Geomathmech Final Sigma  You see Floowander birds, you make this. And you just win. Nothing more to say, they cant out it, and you dont need to think anymore after making it. Win Win  1x Herald of the Arc Light  A lot of decks cant play under this and also its a free negate. You usually make it when you do your halq combo and have an ashuna in gy  1x Shooting Riser Dragon  Makes sure you can also syncro summon in your opponents turn, makes a negated Halq useful and can send either Snow / Token Collector which wins a few match ups. Its also the card you usually use for Amamzing Dragon  1xSwordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao  Searches your extender and is a negate  after wards. Yeah this card is broken  1x Swordsoul Sinister Sovereign - Qixing Longyuan  The best level 10 Syncro in the game as it stops a lot of the current meta decks and singel handly wins the Invoced match up. Also the burn comes up a lot against all the current decks who pay 2000 for verte / stall for time  / pay half for destrudo etc  1x Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon  This card allows you to break boards, bounce 3 in opponents turn and push for game in yours. Its just AMAZING! and a Dragon .... well a sea serpent  1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing  The heart of your Halq combo and way into the Swordsouls. Pop it with baroness or your auroradon and get a free 8 sync + level 10. This card sadly will take the fall for Halqs sins I feel  1x Crystron Halqifibrax  Summon desk bot in your turn or shooting riser in the opponents.  1x <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</span>  Summon deskbot......wait Deja vu  2x <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Monk of the Tenyi</span>  Can probably go to 1, but makes your Tenyi live  1x Salamangreat Almiraj  You only play this to make carboneddon live really, but I guess the effect can come up?  The side deck is pretty standart so not much to say. Usually I either side the rose dragon engine out or the carboneddon depending on how much I need to side in.  &nbsp;  For any questions , just write in the comments and I will get to it.  &nbsp;"

The entire deck is dependent on Elemental Hero Sunrise. It only takes two HERO monsters to fusion summon it onto the field. When it's summoned, you can grab a miracle fusion from the deck and immediately summon another powerful Elemental Hero fusion summon from the extra deck. Sunrise is very powerful because when you attack with another HERO monster, you can destroy a card on the opponent's side of the field. This includes the monster you are attacking. This makes it easy to remove pesky spells/traps when in the battle phase, as well as removing monsters that are difficult to destroy through battle.  This deck makes it very easy to get fusion spells out of the deck with Elemental Hero Blazeman and Sunrise. It's also very easy to search for any elemental hero card you want out of the deck using Elemental Hero Stratos, Elemental Hero Shadow Mist, Masked Hero Dian, and E-Emergency Call. There are plenty of special summoning cards and graveyard padding cards to make it very easy to get cards onto the field to activate their effects.  There are also several cards that allow you to draw outside the draw phase. Elemental Hero Liquid Soldier can be used as a draw 2 and it can send cards to the graveyard from your hand. There are also cards like Pot of Duality, Masked Hero Divine Wind, and Elemental Hero Nova Master that draw cards.  This deck also has plenty of spell/trap removal using Stratos, Sunrise, Masked Hero Acid, Masked Hero Blast, and R-Righteous Justice.  One of the best combos in the deck involves Masked Hero Acid and Elemental Hero Absolute Zero. When Absolute Zero leaves the field, all monsters the opponent controls are destroyed. When Acid is summoned, all spells/traps the opponent controls are destroyed. Using a Mask Change on Absolute Zero can bring Acid onto the field and completely board wipe the opponent. I usually go for this combo when going for lethal.  Using this deck, I have consistently summoned 2-4 fusion monsters on the field in one turn. This deck works really well as a ""go second"" deck since it has plenty of answers to any traps that could have been laid. There are also times where this deck can FTK.  Elemental Heroes have always been one of my favorite archetypes and this is one of the most fun decks I've ever played!

Epigonen, the Impersonation Invader is a crucial card which is why it's featured in so many of my current ABC builds. The card revitalizes otherwise dead hands and gives the deck a better degree of consistency, an expanded level of versatility, and allows for the creation of stronger first turn boards. Typically, you'll want to end on Dragon Buster, Dragoon, Masquerena, and Verte with this build.  You can even prevent a card like Veiler or Impermanence from negating Verte's effect by banishing Verte from the field with Dragon Buster. This variation of the deck utilizes Dragoon over DPE as I appreciate Dragoon's ability to aid in OTKing and its negation effect.  I'm still running a decent line-up of handtraps so as to increase one's ability to stand firm should one's opponent be going first. I'll always have a soft spot for the PSY-Framegear Gamma engine and am still running a copy of PSY-Framelord Omega given how devastating it can be for your opponent if you summon that card after negating a handtrap used against you on your own turn before you've summoned a monster.  While I prefer running two copies of Union Driver, I've decided to run only one in order take full advantage of the fact that Skill Drain is unlimited considering its interaction with ABC Dragon Buster, itself. I'm tempted to cut a copy of Skill Drain, though, or some other card in order to bring the deck back down to forty cards with a forty card build being another variation of this deck that I'm testing.  It's worth noting that running only one Union Driver isn't as detrimental anymore when you have Epigonen considering you can tribute a copy of Crush Wyvern via Epigonen's effect, special summon Union Driver with Wyvern's effect, and proceed to equip Driver to the token summoned by Epigonen before proceeding with the regular shenanigans.  The side deck is still up to major debate as is whether to utilize Pseudo Space, Cynet Universe, or Mystic Mine in the main deck. I prefer Pseudo Space, at the moment, since it serves as an extender which better enables the creation of optimal boards and aids in the accumulation of card advantage, a necessity given how both Dragon Buster and Dragoon require cards to discard to activate some of their most useful effects. There's also no fear if you give it to your opponent as a result of Set Rotation.  I also could see an argument for adjusting the extra deck a bit considering that while Omega is devastating, it only appears in quite specific scenarios whereas something like Knightmare Cerberus, Lambda, and Lyna the Light Charmer can be more consistently brought out with each of those cards having their own benefits.  I'm torn between Borrelsword and Avramax, with Borrelsword being a great boss monster to fall back on while Avramax is a great boss to summon with Masquerena in the event of your Dragon Buster being hit with a card like Called by the Grave after attempting to tag out. Borrelsword, on the other hand, is rather easy to summon with the aid of Epigonen especially when you run Link Spider.  Link Spider is a necessity in the extra deck, regardless of whether you run Borrelsword or Avaramax, considering it can be used to easily summon Verte so long as you open with Epigonen and any other summonable monster, even Ash Blossom, no matter how dead the rest of your hand is. . That last point also ties into another reason why I prefer Dragoon to DPE is because if you start with that aforementioned nearly dead hand, ending on a lone Dragoon is usually more difficult to get over than a lone DPE.  Link Spider is also necessary if you want to summon an Apollousa with four negates on your first turn which is a valid option if  you either know or  believe your opponent has Nibiru."

You want to end in a board that has dpe, scythe, Wandering Gryphon rider and metalfoes combination set, plus whatever interruptions you can make with the metalfoes stuff.  Random extender combos  2 lvl 7's and a random card into the absolute&gt; cross sheep&gt; vortex combo then use cross sheep and the random monster to go into dagda or verte.  Using mithrilium as link material so it floats into a Metalfoes monster then do the dpe scythe stuff easier.  Using metalfoes monsters to set 2 combination, then using magician souls to send the 2 set metalfoes combination to draw 2 and add 2 etc etc I suck at writing the guides so have a video that explains better.
