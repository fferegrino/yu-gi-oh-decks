(Caution) Uses Forbidden cards.,"The main strategy is to Fusion Summon <strong><a data-name=""Elemental Hero Absolute Zero"">Elemental Hero Absolute Zero</a></strong> and get control over the field with it.  It uses the Traditional Format, because it's just that more fun to play. If using Limited, I'd recommend swapping the <strong><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></strong> out and placing a <strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> </strong>in, and replacing <strong><a data-name=""Elder Entity Norden"">Elder Entity Norden</a> </strong>with <strong><a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Dystopia"">Destiny Hero - Dystopia</a>. <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a></strong> is the greatest offender, but it can be easily swapped out for a <strong><a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed.</a></strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Penguin Soldier"">Penguin Soldier</a></strong> provide good counterplay by not destroying monsters, so they deal with Extra Deck monsters. The <strong>Destiny Hero</strong> support provides good card draw, Special Summoning <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Disk Commander"">Destiny HERO - Disk Commander</a></strong>, discarding any <strong>D-HERO</strong> with <strong><a data-name=""Destiny Draw"">Destiny Draw</a></strong>, and being DARK monsters with good mobility with the GY, <strong><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></strong> is a good option because of <strong>D-HERO</strong> support."

Had a hard time letting go of Archfiend Eccentrick from the main deck as it was in the first pendulum deck I used after watching one of Trif's videos, but having it in your starting hand is Death. I also underestimated the field spell's ability as a combo extender if I draw into since it just collects counters and has a built in protection effect. It makes recovery possible if the rest of my board gets cleared while my hand is empty.</em>  <strong>I explain my logic behind all of the cards below, but here's a description of the combos before getting into all of that if you aren't familiar:</strong>  Most of the combos revolve around using <a data-name=""Servant of Endymion"">Servant of Endymion</a>, <a data-name=""Reflection of Endymion"">Reflection of Endymion</a>, and <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a> to special summon monsters from the scales while saving your pendulum summon for the end, along with <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>/<a data-name=""Jester Confit"">Jester Confit</a> as special summons, so that you can link into Crowley for the Spellbook engine **<em>if you still have targets**.  </em>Usually you will use Servant to special summon Jackal King so you can start build Spell Counters, and also to protect yourself against a potential Nibiru/Gamma, but there might be instances where you can think of a better monster to summon, like, for example, Magical Abductor to search for Magicians' Souls for your Restage engine. Remember that there are only 5 spellbook cards in the deck, as well as 4 potential targets for Crowley. If you used Pot of Desires, check the banished stack to make sure that there are not 2 or more targets in there or else Crowley will be useless.  If you don't go into Crowley, then try to go into Selene if you have the desired monster in your graveyard, or Saryuja if you have 4 disposable monsters on the field (generally don't use Jackal King/Mighty Master to go into Saryuja unless you can still use your pendulum summon to bring them back out, but do that ASAP).  Use <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One and Magicians' Souls with Selene in mind. If you don't have the desired negates in your hand, or, for One for One, if you have to choose between a negate boss monster and a scale that plusses, send that negate to the GY, because you can use Selene to bring them back. Also remember that if you send Reflection to the GY, you can summon her on the opponents turn to bounce back one of their cards.</a>  <a data-name=""One for One"">Try to avoid normal summoning unless its </a><a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy (Blue Boy), because that allows you to choose him as a viable/non-dead target for Crowley, because you thin 3 cards from your deck and get a guaranteed Draw 2 if Crowley resolves.</a>  If you have to, normal summon Magical Abductor to build counters to search for Souls. This way you can pitch a negate to the GY, but then if/when you summon Crowley: <em>don't use Blue Boy as a target</em>. Use Spellbook of Secrets, Knowledge, and Power. Worst case scenario: you can still get another spell counter and 1000 attack on a monster (this is explained below).  I say ""ash bait"" a lot, but remember that, since you have a few avenues to try and get to your end board, the role of ash bait tends to shift around depending on which engine is the most easily accessible with your starting hand  <strong>Main Deck:</strong>  The core monsters for all of the Endymion decks I've posted on here have mostly been the same, although I reduced <a data-name=""Cerberus"">Cerberus</a> to 1 again since I only mostly use it to bait ash, and if I don't start with it, I usually draw into Jackal King easily enough anyways, in which case I sometimes use it to search Garuda. Another questionable choice I might have made was Magister, which I'm running at 1, because even though its not high priority I use it for recovery if I get board-wiped with Zeus and all my pendulum monsters are in the extra deck, its also nice to summon reflection on the opponents turn to bounce back their summons if I'm unable to draw into my negate-heavy monsters.  <em>Restage Engine:</em>  Pretty self-explanatory stuff here. I'm running 3 Restage and 1 Right Hand in the main deck. I'm keeping Left Hand in the side deck against trap-heavy opponents.  With the Restage engine, I'm actually running 2 souls and 1 confit instead of 3 of either. Obviously I feel like Souls should be mandatory for the Restage engine, but I'm giving priority normal summon to Magical Abductor to build counters to search for Souls, and I'm also running One for One to summon Souls and potentially set a target for Selene in the GY from my hand. One for One is also just another spell to build counters that's rarely ever dead and adds to my field while also giving me counters, which I really like. The single Jester confit is there instead of a third Souls as a free special summon if I ever start with souls in hand, or if I'm deliberately avoiding a normal summon so that I can use Blue Boy as one of my targets for Crowley. This is one of the reasons I'm running the Chronograph engine (free spell counter, free special summon, and if I have a second Chronograph in hand, then its *another* free special summon if not just a free target for One for One).  **edit: I actually reduced the Chronograph engine from 3 to 2 to add in Reasoning, with the reasoning (lol) that its still usually special summon for the most part as well as a spell counter either way, therefore still usually accomplish the purpose of Chronograph Sorcerer for me, but also because, if I draw into Reasoning, vs the 3rd copy of Chronograph, and I had already used Chronograph's effect, or banished Timegazer with Desires, then Reasoning is still live in my hand (I'm really trying to eliminate dead cards as much as I can without affecting the versatility of my monsters)**  <em>Spellbook Engine:</em>  My spellbook engine used to be 2 Blue Boy, 2 Secrets, 1 Knowledge, but *because* I'm giving priority normal summon to Abductor, I wanted to reduce Blue Boy. I didn't want to eliminate him entirely, because he's nice ash bait, but also is one of the preferred targets for Crowley alongside Secrets and Knowledge. Secrets is still at 2 because with 3 targets in the deck its rarely dead, but at 3 I feel like it wouldn't help that much. Spellbook of *Power* may seem like an odd inclusion in the deck (and honestly it might be, if you guys know a better Spellbook spell that has a better chance of being live in my hand lmk), however, my reasoning for this is that, if Blue Boy gets ash'd, I want to give myself the option to still go into Crowley, without drawing chance giving me a dead card (another blue boy would run the risk of me grabbing a dead blue boy in my hand with Crowley's effect if I already normal summoned blue boy), and most of the other Spellbook cards seem to be pretty reliant on having Spellbook spell cards already in my hand. With Power, however, if I can still search for a Spellbook spell if I just destroy another monster in battle, and it will also still give me counters (it's pretty low priority though with respect to Crowley's effect and in this would be a worst-case scenario for me). Of course there's Upstart, Instant Fusion for spell counters and also handtrap protection with Millennium Eyes and 2 Pot of Desires instead of 3, because I'm normally getting enough draws and thinning out my deck with both the Restage and Spellbook Engines, and I can even go into Saryuja with little difficulty without pendulum summoning.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  In terms of the Extra Deck, its usually the same every time I post it, but I made a few changes and I'll just explain all my decisions here: there's Underworld Goddess for that ""extra deck kaiju"" business, which I can summon on the opponents turn using their monster if I have Masquerena on field (kinda like unchained except it doesn't target which is really nice and probably my favorite play with Masquerena). It also has a nice protection effect and can negate a summon from the GY. I have Accesscode for the OTK and high ATK. Selene to climb into Accesscode but also for counters to extend my plays-- its also nice to summon Reflection from the GY to bounce and opponents monster (really any card but usually monster), and its also a really nice stall card if nothing else, especially if I summon it with Masquerena. I only really use Apollousa if my hand is just really shit, I've used the spellbook engine and I don't have enough material to draw 4 off of Saryuja, and then I also have Knightmare unicorn for non-destruction removal on the opponents turn. Knightmare Phoenix if the opponent does something like Anti-Spell/Imperial Order/TCBOO etc., the Odd-Eyes package, Cross-Sheep with the Odd-Eyes Package so I can climb into Selene, Artemis if I start with a normal summonable pendulum monster and Knowledge and so I can still draw 2 if I don't start with souls/blue boy/confit as well. There's also a nice combo with Artemis and restage, where I can special summon either souls or confit, link into Artemis, re-summon souls/confit with restage and link into Crowley to still have all my preferred Spellbook targets usable.  <strong>Side Deck:</strong>  For the side deck, theres Pankratops, which is another one of my answers to Anti-Spell/Imperial Order, and of course red reboot. My blind second card that I usually side in is Evenly Matched, and I'll normally side out Cerberus, Spellbook of Power and either Right Hand or Left Hand depending on the match up.  **Didn't think I'd have to do this but: The reason I'm running Evenly vs Lightning Storm or Harpie's or Raigeki/Dark Hole is because: It doesn't target, it doesn't destroy, and it isn't once per turn. So if it resolves, worst case scenario you have to play through 2 disruptions (one on field and one in hand), best case scenario you can basically OTK. If it doesn't resolve, its because the opponent negated it, which means they would have negated any of the other above mentioned spells, which means: best case scenario they used their one spell/trap negate and you can still do full combo with Mighty Master to blow up their board, or worst case scenario they still had 50 billion spell/trap negates and you couldn't do jack anyways**  **Edit: I used to have 3 Nibiru because of Dragon Link, and that ridiculous Deskbot/Halq/Auroradon combo, but I realized that, not only can nibiru be negated, but that if I don't start with Nibiru in hand, its better to draw into Sphere Mode to break the opponents board rather than Nibiru**  Against monster heavy decks, I'm using Dark Ruler No More instead of Droplet, because I don't want to reduce my hand at all for follow up plays. The 2 Cosmic Cyclones are for match-ups against Eldlich."

Basically you want to search one of your ""Invocation-Cards"" and go for the best extra-deck option. Sometimes you'll have to link summon a monster to use it as link material so it can be used for Invocation in grave. If you are not able to do a good Fusion-Summon in first turn, equip one Magistus-Monster through its own effects and/or Spells (fo.e. Endymion -&gt; effect, use Aiwass and/or Vhram)  You can also add the Dragoon engine here but i like to play this Deck as it is."

(Your field should have Cherubini, Archfiend, Torn Scale, and Shade Brigandine. In the hand, there should be Infernity Necromancer)</li>  	<li>Activate the effect of Proxy F Magician to fusion summon Starving Venom Fusion Dragon using rest of the monsters on your field, to a zone which Proxy F Magician points to.</li>  	<li>Activate the second effect of Proxy F Magician (Special summon a monster with less than 1000 ATK from your hand when a fusion monster was special summoned to a zone this card points to) to special summon Infernity Necromancer from hand.</li>  	<li>Activate Infernity Necromancer's effect to special summon Infernity Archfiend from graveyard, and activate its effect to add Infernity Patriarch to hand.</li>  	<li>Link summon Cross-Sheep using Infernity Necromancer and Proxy F Magician and special summon Infernity Patriarch to a zone Cross-Sheep points to, using its own effect. (Cross-Sheep should be pointing at Starving Venom and Infernity Patriarch)</li>  	<li>Then, use Cross-Sheep's effect to special summon Necromancer back from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Overlay Patriarch and Archfiend into Dugares, and use its effect to special summon its own material, Archfiend.</li>  	<li>Use Archfiend's effect to add Infernity Launcher to hand, and just put it on field.</li>  	<li>Link summon Saryuja using all monsters on your field, except the Necromancer. (Still hasn't used the effects yet)</li>  	<li>If you want to take the chance and try using the 3rd effect of Saryuja, (Draw 4, put back 3) you can try, but I am not going over that since that is based on luck.</li>  	<li>Activate Necromancer's effect to special summon Archfiend, then its effect to add Infernity Mirage to hand.</li>  	<li>Activate second effect of Saryuja (Special summon from hand) and summon Mirage to the field.</li>  	<li>Link summon Apollousa using Saryuja, Archfiend, and Necromancer. (To empty the field a little and send archfiend and necromancer to the graveyard)</li>  	<li>Use Mirage's effect of special summon Archfiend and Necromancer from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Use Archfiend's effect to add Infernity Avenger to hand, and discard it using Infernity Launcher's first effect.</li>  	<li>Activate Necromancer's effect to special summon launcher.</li>  	<li>Link summon Halqifibrax using Avenger and Archfiend, and activate its effect to summon Infernity Wildcat from the deck.</li>  	<li>Overlay Necromancer and Wildcat into Rebarian Shark. (Material of Z-ARC)</li>  	<li>Link summon Verte Anaconda using Halqifibrax and Rebarian Shark.</li>  	<li>Activate Launcher's effect to special summon Necromancer and Avenger.</li>  	<li>Special summon Archfiend from the graveyard using Necromancer's effect, and search Infernity Paranoia.</li>  	<li>Activate Paranoia on Necromancer to summon Infernity Conjurer from the deck.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Hundred Eyes Dragon using Archfiend, Conjurer, and Avenger and activate its effect to banish Mirage from the graveyard and gain its effect.</li>  	<li>Use Hundred Eyes Dragon's effect (Infernity Mirage's effect) to tribute itself and special summon Necromancer and Avenger.</li>  	<li>Special summon Archfiend using Necromancer's effect and use its effect to search Infernity Barrier or Suppression.</li>  	<li>Use Conjurer's own effect to special summon itself from the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Shooting Riser Dragon using Avenger, Conjurer, and Necromancer.</li>  	<li>Activate Riser's effect upon summon to send Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm to the graveyard, and Riser becomes level 3. (Which doesn't matter if you're not planning a Calamity)</li>  	<li>Activate Verte Anaconda's second effect to pay 2000 LP and send Miracle Synchro Fusion to the graveyard, and banish Number 71: Rebarian Shark (XYZ Dragon monster), Hundred Eyes Dragon (Synchro Dragon Monster), Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (Fusion Dragon Monster), and Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (Pendulum Dragon Monster) to the graveyard to summon Supreme King Z-ARC from your extra deck, obliterating your opponent's field while getting at least 4 negates.

This due to the fact that I feel people are prepared for trap-heavy builds in the TCG with decks like guru being a threat. my cybers rations are pretty standard in my opinion but I do like Backup Secretary at 2-3 for my cyber's decks. I went with two Accesscode because this is a control deck and you might have to pull out a second one after your first one gets destroyed. (because really pulling two out is a stupid flex you should not do)  basic combo for beginners.  normal Lady Debug add Backup Secretary sp Backup Secretary go link 2 Splash Mage, splash mage sp debug link 3 Transcode Talker transcode sp splashmage link 4 Accesscode Talker add 3000 atk.

Ignister Deck 2021 using the new support cards. Summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6k attack and unaffected by card effects, or do an ","Hello,  I've built a A.I. deck recently and tested it on A LOT of games... I play yu gi oh since years, and really it's just the best deck I did.  The new support Dark Infant @Ignister is just amazing and give A.I. decks a new breath. I tested and with this deck I succeed to beat easily Eldich decks, Drytron decks and all meta decks....  <strong>There is two options with this deck : </strong> <ul>  	<li>The 'Unbreakable' board : by doing the combo in order to summon (easily !) The Arrival Cyberse atIgnister, which is a card with 6000 attack, non affected by card effects and the effect to destroy 1 card and summon 1 token each turn.... If your opponent doesn't have Kaiju it will be a little tricky for him... Even if he has monsters like Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon or Mekk-Knight Crusadia because we have in this deck Forbidden Droplet or TA.I Strike which can protect him during battle phases.</li>  	<li>The OTK : by doing the combo in order to summon Accesscode Talker and Transcode Talker by using Update Jammer in order to allow them to attack twice ! Then with this combo we can have Accesscode with 5200 attack which can attack twice and has the faculty to destroy up to 3 cards using this deck without the possibility for your opponent to respond AND Transcode Talker with 2300 attack which can also attack twice... Hey hey boy.</li> </ul> <strong>The hand traps and counter cards : </strong>  So... We have 12 cards that are used to counter combo decks or ""full traps boards"" : <ul>  	<li>Nibiru : which is of course amazing against combo decks. And then we can use Nibiru with Pikari @Ignister to have A.I. Land and after that summoning Barricadeborg Blocker and then doing our combo. Or we can use Nibiru with Achichi @Ignister with can then be used to summon Hiyari @Ignisrer or Doshin @Ignister. After that we can then summon Dark Templar @Ignister and summoning The Arrival @Ignister or doing the OTK combo, as we want.</li>  	<li>Lightning storm : at the beginning of the game, everytime very usefull.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet : to protect The Arrival @Ignister or to allow them to do our combo.</li>  	<li>Evenly Matched : at the beginning of the game, everytime very usefull.</li>  	<li>Red reboot : to prevent the opponent to play traps card during our turn. It is very usefull at the beginning of the game if we want to do the combo in order to summon The Arrival @Ignister. Because in fact, he is unaffected by card effects :).... So we don't care about another trap card.</li> </ul> <strong>The combos : </strong>  To summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6000 attack : <ul>  	<li>We need to have Pikari and Achichi in our hand and other Ignister. If we only have 2 Ignister in our hand, The Arrival will have 4000 attack instead of the maximum of 6000 attack.</li>  	<li>Summon Dark Infand using Pikari or Achichi</li>  	<li>Use the field card to spam Ignisters. The goal is have 3 Ignisters with different name on our board in order to summon Dark Templar @Ignister in the <span><strong>right (not left) </strong></span>extra zone AND to still have in our hand one of this : <ul>  	<li>2 Ignister including Doshin @Ignister or Hiyari @Ignister in our hand</li>  	<li>Doshin @Ignister or Hiyari @Ignister + A.I.dle Reborn</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>After that, we can summon 1 Ignister from our hand or GY (by using A.I.dle Reborn) in a zone which is not one of the zones Dark Templare @Ignister points to.</li>  	<li>After that we need to summon Dark Infant @Ignister in the left zone pointed by Dark Templare.</li>  	<li>Then we can use the effect of Dark Templare @Ignister and then chain with the effect of Dark Infant in order to move him to the left zone and change his attribute. The attribute needs to be Earth if the other Ignister in your hand is Hiyari @Ignister or it needs to be Water if the monster in your hand is Doshin @Ignister.</li>  	<li>After that, summon 3 different monsters from your GY using the Dark Templare effect. These monsters need to have different attributes AND need to not be dark (because Dark Templare is already a dark monster)</li>  	<li>Then summon the last monster from your hand. Now you will have 6 different monsters on your board with different attributes. You can then special summon The Arrival @Ignister with 6000 attack !!! But before that don't forget one last step : summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister from your extra deck using Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister, then summon from your GY the Pikari that was used for this synchro summon. By doing it, you can clean all spells / traps on the opponent board and you will have The Arrival with 6000 attack and Pegasus @Ignister in your GY, which can be usefull because of his effect.</li> </ul> The OTK combo : <ol>  	<li>It is the same combo. Instead that you only need to summon Dark Templare and having 1 monster in your hand.</li>  	<li>After that, summon Dark Infant by using the monster from your hand, use the same logic of the first combo to have on your board 5 monsters including Dark Templare.</li>  	<li>Summon Update Jammer by using 2 monsters that you want BUT not Dark Templare</li>  	<li>Summon Transcode Talker by using 2 monster including Update Jammer BUT not Dark Templare</li>  	<li>Use the effect of Transcode Talker to summon from your GY Update Jammer</li>  	<li>Summon Accesscode Talker by using Dark Templare and Update Jammer</li> </ol> <strong>The little tip </strong>  If your opponent negate the effect of Dark Templare, we can still use him with Dark Infant @Ignister to summon the Link 4 Mekk-Knight Crusadia ! Which cannot be targeted by card effects and is unbeatable by battle (most of the time)"

First off, this isn't perfect, but it works well for me. I've researched many versions of this deck, and in a way, this is a combination of various strategies I've found. I was looking to build a version that is consistent and fast, so I came up with this. You can say that this is a turbo/combo variation of the deck. I do have my own criticism with it because it requires running a bit of bricks, but I can say for the most part that it is pretty clean. I have been able to summon Magnus with 9 materials a few times which I was never able to do in other versions I've seen. But that isn't the point here. Usually, you can summon him within a turn or two. If all else fails, you can play the long game and clutch, but this is susceptible to disruptions. Anyways, I hope to hear anything constructive or helpful to tweak this to be even better!"

(ANOTHER ONE!) I made a build a few weeks ago and I have been testing it out in duelingbook rated and I have made quite a few changes to the deck and I have updated combos, new card additions and replays of a few duels. With Drytrons and Virtual worlds’ win condition VFD gone, there is literally nothing that stops dragons from being the BEST deck of the March 2021 format. Not even Zoo Eldlich is as good as this deck (it is also tier 1 but In my opinion dragons are the better choice). I have even made a vow to not play any duels on rated this format except with dragon link. If I were to make any edits to this decklist, I will post an updated one in the future so stay tuned!! I really hope you enjoy this article Since I went all out typing all this :)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, test hands, deck explanations and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBnD5AZVUB4</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Why this is One of the best decks to play this format</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is really good for the current format because it is so good at playing through handtraps and well established boards. The deck has just so many extenders that it can keep going. Even my arch nemesis (nibiru) cannot stop this deck for performing a well established board (sometimes it does - those are times we do not speak of). It can play through droll as well (ends on seals + tidying + savage AT LEAST). It can also set up a variety of high impact disruptions during an opponent's turn like OMNI negates, Bounces (not targeted removal) and even multiple monster effect negations. Seals and tidying do a good job countering zoodiac and for eldlich you have a bunch of side deck options. Dragon link is the best deck of the format as of now not because of how many negates it sets up, but because of its consistency and being able to play through hand traps and negates. What it does, it does consistently and with ease. Unlike a deck like zoo eldlich which gets hard countered by anti- control cards (get rid of the normal summon is usually gg to the zoo engine and any kind of backrow removal can deal with eldlich) dragon link has little weaknesses. Dragons are back, you’ll see what I mean after the deck explanation.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>Deck composition</b><span> -</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is obviously a 40 card deck for consistency reasons and it must stay that way. If you want, you can play the deck with 42-43ish cards but I do not recommend playing a deck with anything more than that amount. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Notice</b><span>: some cards are in more than one category, this means that they have multiple uses depending on your situation.</span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><b>Starters - </b><span>cards that you use to get your combo going, usually your normal summon but there are exceptions. </span></td> <td><span>For the starters of the deck I am playing 3 Chamber Dragonmaid (my personal favorite), 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 1 black metal, 1 darkness metal, 2 seyfert and 3 chaos space. The ratios are almost the same from my last build but for this updated version I am including the 1 black metal and cutting seyfert to 2 copies. (Was at 3 in my last version) I did this because variety is always good and playing black metal gives us access to darkness metal which is a VERY good extender that I did not include in my last build. Black metal can also be used as an alternative monster to summon off of elpy if you draw a broutar or lavineer. The baby chaos dragons also count as starters since chaos space and seyfert are basically used to search them out. If you draw one of them with a normal summon of the opposite attribute or have a monster with the opposite attribute in the grave you have more than full combo. The same applies to darkness metal dragon. Chamber Dragonmaid unlike the other starters does not bring out 2 dragons to the field but searches the very high impact Dragonmaid tidying. This is by far the best starter (my opinion) since the deck plays so many extenders and since tidying adds to your negates (very high impact and is effective against the metagame).</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Rokket engine</b><span> - cards that support the rokkets and cards from the archetype in general</span></td> <td><span>For the Rokket engine, I am playing 2 tracer (explian this in a second), 2 synchron, 1 recharger, 1 absorouter, 1 boot sector and 3 quick launch. I decided to cut down tracer to 2 copies rather than 3 because I wanted the deck to be strictly 40 cards and because I am playing 2 synchron I figured that the ratio would work fine. Absorouter is mainly to mill off of ravine to search a rokket (the one to search depends on the situation) or if you draw it you can simply discard it with something like chaos space or you can even use it as an extender to special summon it out. Boot sector is a soft brick because drawing it will mean a -1 since you will search it for free with striker dragon and NOBODY throws away an ash blossom on a striker dragon (even if they do they wasted their ash and you can probably combo safely and dish out a multiple negate board). Quick launch can summon tracer or synchron (or recharger, not sure why you would do that though) from the deck and is a great extender as well, no explanation needed there. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Extenders</b><span> - cards that help you make a better board and help out of you get hand trapped or play through well established boards</span></td> <td><span>For extenders we have 3 quick launch, 3 World legacy gaurdragon, 2 dragonmaid tidying, 3 noctovision dragon, 1 absorouter dragon, 1 broutar, 1 lavineer, 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 1 darkness metal dragon and even 3 chaos space (this might never come up but you can search lavineer with this as well if you used the baby chaos dragons). The baby chaos dragons and darkness metal are extenders if drawn since they do not require the normal summon to bring out. Chaos space is an extender because you can search lavineer with it (you will almost never do this) and can then use broutar to search something like noctovision with broutar OR you can search one of the chaos dragon with it. This is useful in a number of ways. Let's say you use chamber dragonmaid as your starter. Then you can use chaos space to search the chaos dragons (white and black) and use them to extend your plays and set up more negates or you can use them as backup if you get hit with lets say something high impact like nibiru or gamma. If you draw seyfert as your starter and have chaos space in hand as well, then you can either simply discard space to recycle the chaos dragons and get card advantage or you can search lavineer with it (if you have a light monster in your hand to spare - unlikely since the deck runs minimal light monsters). World legacy is a monster reborn like card and is basically like 3 extenders in 1 because it can reborn a monster, it can change the zone of elpy to help gaurdragon combos go on with 1 less monster and it can also be popped using tracer to summon a rokket!! So many uses for 1 card!! There is also a combo with this I show in my video, make sure to check it out! The rest of the cards I think are just plain extenders and I have mentioned them before, no explanation needed there. Another great thing about extenders is that if you draw an extra one, you can end on an extra negate since elpy can summon chamber instead of broutar which means an extra tidying!! Tidying is also an extender because if draw it can be discarded, and then it can reborn chamber from the grave or this effect can be used for the turn after you used it’s negation effect as a good follow up. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Combo Extenders</b><span> - these are cards that if you draw, that will help you set up more negates / interruptions in your end board. They however do not always help you if you get hand trapped (in some cases they do help) like regular extenders.</span></td> <td><span>I have all the things that are in the “extender” section in here as well but I will not mention them here. The combo extenders are - 2 rokket tracer, 2 rokket synchron, 1 rokket recharger, 2 dragon maid tidying and (in some cases) chamber dragonmaid. Chamber is the best starter in my opinion but it is also a combo extender. It helps search tidying (extra negate) when summoned and if you use your starter as something that does not normal summon, chamber becomes a combo extender as well. All the rokkets if drawn can be summoned off of boot (boot can summon up to 2 from hand). Tidying is just a negate on it’s own (just set it) and it is also an extender since it can banish itself from the GY (follow up turn) to reborn a chamber which can be used to link into something like borrelsword to OTK and chamber can even search an additional tidying to play the grind game!! </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Handtraps</b><span> - to prevent the opponent from doing way toooooo much stuff </span></td> <td><span>I am playing 3 ash (standard) and 3 PSY-gamma. Gamma is good to protect seyfert and chaos space from getting hit with ash blossom from the opponent and can also help to make an earlier savage dragon to protect from nibiru. This deck can play through handtraps and negates of well established boards really well so I decided to minimize on handtraps. If you want, you can throw in more handtraps and cut some extenders but with much testing, I think more extenders is the better call.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Soft Bricks</b><span> - cards you don’t always what to draw, drawing them usually means a -1 since you search them anyways</span></td> <td><span>There is boot sector launch and dragon ravine. Especially boot sector since striker will never be negated and drawing it means you get a -1 basically. Romulus gets negated sometimes so ravine is not that bad of a draw. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Big boy brick</b><span> - NEVER want to draw this card, if you do I’m sorry</span>  <span>Btw drawing PSY-driver also means a -1, nothing too big</span></td> <td><span>Only 1 brick.</span>  <span>“A Psychic soldier that rides into battle against the Security Forces on currents of lightning, using an autonomic amplifier called PSY-Frame.”</span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Changes to the Extra and side decks</b>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>No longer running Number 62</b><span>: Since Konami completely exodia obliterated Drytrons with the banlist, there is no longer a need to even play this and it is irrelevant to play this just for eldlich since they have other ways to win and other ways to get golden boy onto the field. </span></li> </ol> </li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>I’m not running abomination and Dill: <span>These were just not needed and I decided to kick them out of the decklist.</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">I’m running borrelsword<span>: It is a better OTK card and a better version of unchained (unfortunately requires 3+ monsters) BUT getting this onto your field turn 2 will (most to the time) be an auto win.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">I’m running seal at 2 copies: <span>this was needed since there are always chances your opponent can play through the disruptions and also seals in an AMAZING card so 2 is better.</span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Striker dragon is at 3: <span>I was really dumb to not do this in my last build since I did not have space.

Halq is 4 negates with the new Magikey?! They float too as follow-up. Board is DRNM/Zeus proof with tons of handtraps.,"https://youtu.be/Ch662tTwTHI  mAgiKeY Lel. Full combo is <strong>Halq+field spell</strong> (4 negates, Borreload Savage, Clear Wing Fast, Magikey lv8 ritual, and counter trap), <strong>minimal combo is Halq only</strong> (3 negates, minus the counter trap). Both endboards are Zeus proof because with VFD gone, simple multiple negations cannot block Zeus. Watch the combo in the video.  The gameplan is to dump different attribute to the GY (light is the most important) while combo-ing so the Magikey lv8 ritual can negate more stuff. Avoid using lv1 monster (Effect Veiler, Tenyi Adhara), because it cant reach lv8 ritual fodder.  To make Halq with Nibiru proof, you can use Atlantean/Deep Sea engine from <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/absolutely-fair-abhyss/"">ABSOLUTELY FAIR ABHYSS</a>, but it comes with more bricks (deck is already bricky enough with normal monsters as fodder for the ritual/fusion) and Magikey needs normal monster to function. Psy-Frame Driver is kinda useful too here, as it is a high level light normal monster for ritual fodder.  &nbsp;  Pros: Legit consistent board with great meta matchup and bis staple slot.  Cons: Fragile (can be made Nibiru proof as mentioned above)."

I love this deck, and know the ins and outs of it. This so far has been the most competitive list I have attempted to make, after lots of testing. The thing about Synchrons is that they lack playable cards that replace themselves and you have to open certain combinations of cards to be able to play and combo, so this list aims to remedy that with the support that we have at the moment.  The deck will still open kind of unplayable hands, but thats what the Halq-Auroradon line is for.  DO NOT GO FOR THIS PLAY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPELL /TRAP TO SET. This will result in Tzolkin Pass.  Combo: Turbo out speeder, any way you can and summon it to the extra monster zone, If you open any of your Synchron Garnets, and Junk connector, resolve junk connector to bring the garnet back, whether that be a Hyper Synchron, Fleur, and so on. Summon Quickdraw, Hyper, Junk, Fleur, and Cyberse Synchrons from your deck with Speeder. Then contact your Quickdraw Synchron and Junk Speeder into Tzolkin (summon it to one of the main monster zones). Then set a card from your hand to trigger Tzolkin, then summon Power Tool Dragon with Tzolkin's effect to the extra monster zone. Search for a copy of Living fossil from deck with Power tool. Then make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon using Cyberse Synchron and Power Tool Dragon, summon it in the extra monster zone.  After that, use living fossil to bring back a level 2 monster from the graveyard (the one you used to summon Speeder) and Make Garden Rose Maiden with Junk Synchron and the Level 2. Then Synchro summon Dawn Dragster using Fleur Synchron and Garden Rose Maiden. After that, Make Geomathmech Final Sigma using Hyper Synchron and Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and summon it to the extra monster zone. Then you can activate the graveyard effect of Garden Rose Maiden to bring back Crystal Wing. You end on a Board of Geomathmech Final Sigma in the EMZ, a Crystal Wing for a monster negate, F.A. Dawn Dragster for a Spell negate, and Tzolkin.  For the Halq Line, just make Halq with any tuner plus any monster or any 2 tuners. When you summon Halq, use its effect to summon Deskbot 001 from deck, Then Link them into  Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon. Then summon 3 tokens, this will trigger the Deskbot in grave, summon it using its effect. Then summon Herald of The Arc Light using one Mecha Phantom Beast Token and the Deskbot. After that activate the second effect of Auroradon to destroy the two remaining tokens to summon Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing from deck. On summon, the Coltwing will summon 2 more LVL3 tokens. This will trigger the effect of Deskbot 001 again, summon it again. After you, Synchro Summon Power Tool Dragon using 2 tokens and the Deskbot. After that search for a copy of Living Fossil from deck. Then activate the Living fossil to bring back the Deskbot one more time. Now you synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon using the Deskbot and Power Tool. Equip the Halq from graveyard to the Savage Dragon.  &nbsp;"

There is a card which is called DMZ dragon which can equip a level 4 or lower dragon monster to any dragon monster you control and it's effect is not even a HOPT.  With other words we just have to get buster dest. sword into the gy and dmz onto the board. And the easiest way to achive this is by using the buster link and striker dragon into recharger to get dmz back onto the board.  And the good thing about dmz is that he isn't HOPT, so we can just use divine lance again do get access to phalanx, then get dmz through elpy and loop dmz a couple of times to get free link/synchro material.  So yeah that's basically the new d-link varient, thx. konami for buster lock reloded.  And btw. my decklist is just an example, Im sure there are better ways to build it. I mean the banlist isn't even out yet and we still have to experiment with it, but I think it's a good start.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

That (and 3 cans of beer) made my mind clear like a blank paper. Why should I follow the meta when my oldest waifu haven't hit the field even once? I once owned Cosmo Queen OCG card, the original one with small description border and I love it so much.  Cosmo Queen alone is worthless normal monster. Her only (not so) specific support card is Cosmo Brain and that is not enough. While other spellcaster-engines such as Witchcrafter, Magistus, Spellbook and Pendulam can bring her on the board quickly enough, the Dark Magician is more potent on Normal Spellcaster Monster and Cosmo Queen can play along nicely.  &nbsp;  How to play.  1. Use Dark Magician engine to Summon Ebon Illusion Magician(EIM asap.  2. Use EIM ability to summon Cosmo Queen.  3. Attack with Cosmo Queen.  That's it. If u can bring Cosmo Queen out that mean your board is already good.  &nbsp;  I do not care much about comboing because all I care is to bring Cosmo queen on the board as quickly as possible and the only achetypes I love is Spellcaster. If u have more potent cards to bring Cosmo Queen on the board please tell me.  PS. Kawaita Sakebi is an amazing song."

Una carta. Una travesura. El más grandioso FTK en la historia! OwO It was about time it was born. A card. A mischief. T,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Ganar con el efecto de Ghostrick Angel of Mischief para ganar de la manera más gloriosa! (y consistente) OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/Jl1JScrbN_o &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Shien's Smoke Signal: </strong>Nos busca un Six Samurai.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Mizuho: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a Shinai, si no, puede hacer de Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Shinai: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a Mizuho, si no, puede hacer de Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Six Samurai Kizan: </strong>Se invoca si tenemos a cualquier Six Samurai. Muy útil.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>  	<li>El deck no depende del burn, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP del oponente.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de conseguir contadores con el loop de los Six Samurai, por lo que hay que calcular dicha cantidad de contadores antes de acabar con el loop.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"
