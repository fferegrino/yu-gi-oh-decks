Going first are harder and harder to survive. A lot of decks are trying to play going second. Often due to going second having 1 more starting card in the hand which can help for breaking your opponent's board.  So we are going second. Using multiple cards that gives board advantage and break board possibility.  Starting off with super poly, pankratop, tenyi vishuda which has direct board destruction possibility.  Against decks that summon extra deck monster.  cyber dragon and shaddol fusion are the tech.  evenly match is a good for everything. At least it can bait out back row negation such us solemn judgment.  twin twister to go against decks such as sky striker and true draco.  instant fusion to thousand-eyes restrict and mind control are always good to disrupt your opponent's field  I didn't put any hand traps cuz they doesn't really affect today's tier 1 deck. most of them can play around them unless you have more than 3 hand traps. But having so many hand traps means that you won't be able to build a perfect board at your turn and all the resources are gone.  For the second game. very possible your opponent will be going second. at that time, cards like cyber dragon, evenly match, are less useful so you can side in hand traps at that time. You can side in at that time cards like rivalry and shiranui tech to focus on a more grinding game."

I know in the past you guys really supported my previous Trickstar Sky Striker builds, so thank you for that. In testing this deck can brick but it ends up winning somehow lol. Overall the ratios are correct in my opinion. This deck always wants to go first, especially since the <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> + <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> combo is still a thing and can win you the entire game if it resolves. A lot of people screw up the combo's chain links and don't do it right. The correct chain is Reincarnation first, then chain Droll second that way Droll will come first and prevent your opponent from drawing after Reincarnation resolves after Droll resolves. Now I know you are probably why only one Candina? Its because I think a second Raye is necessary considering <a data-name=""Trickstar Light Stage"">Trickstar Light Stage</a> is at one and drawing a lot of monsters is not a good thing. You want to see spells in your hand more, especially when going second. The Solemns put in a lot of work especially going first, it wins you a lot of games as per my play testing. As always I hope you guys enjoy it and as always stick around for more, I have a lot of cool decks planned to post!"

This strategy aims to restrict absolutely everything which the opponent does, until their deck is empty of any useful resources, such that they can't assemble any real wincon. During the 20-30 turns it takes to achieve this, we accrue advantage very slowly with slight +1s, namely with the deck's primary draw engine, <a data-name=""Dark Factory of More Production"">Dark Factory of More Production</a>. By turn 20, you should have 3-4 negates on board (usually handtraps, searched by <a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a>), a full grip of 6 cards in hand, and your opponent should have less than 4 cards in their combined hand/field. This means that there is no possible move for them to win the game. There are a number of ways to reduce the opponent's LP to zero, but at this point, you've already won. Generally, the final wincon (on turn 30+) is a Normal or Special Summoned <a data-name=""Slifer the Sky Dragon"">Slifer the Sky Dragon</a> with 10,000+ ATK, which pretty much always seals the win. If it doesn't, you can add it back to hand withÂ <a data-name=""Legacy of the Duelist"">Legacy of the Duelist</a> to try again."

This deck is not meant to be the most competitive that Elemental HERO can be. It's meant to be a fun deck that can use the many Fusions that are available to the archetype. The main deck monsters allow for various combos that let you Special Summon multiple times per turn, especially when combined with the Quick-Play Spell 'Mask Change'. There's monsters that can alter ATK, destroy Spells/Traps, get you additional Special Summons and also lock out the opponent's GY.  Using Honest Neos just feels so good. Most people know about Honest, but Honest Neos has proven to not be as well known, so especially if you drew into it as opposed to searching for it (through something like Shadow Mist's effect), you can really mess up your opponent's plans."

N'tiss gives you free pops with Claw, Quasar is a great monster to equip to Cyberdarkness Dragon, with a Shooting Star to go with it ofc. Windwitch engine because Cyberdarks aren't going to be making an ExtraÂ  Deck play turn 1 even if their lives depended on it, and it gives you another good target for Cyberdarkness if Quasar hasn't been milled yet. You could also probably fit Superpoly in here somewhere just for Starving Venom's sake, but that card was forbidden when I first made this list and I haven't really needed it in any of the games I've played with the deck.

Tsuchinoko? and then from there spreading A-Counters with its effect. Lightserpent is also included alongside the previously mentioned Danger!? Tsuchinoko? as they have good synergy with both of Mighty/Frame's effects, though if you don't care about the Graveyard effect you can switch them out with other recursion cards. Hypno and Catalyst Field are also included because of the former's consistency being boosted thanks to Mighty/Frame. Mysterious Triangle is ran at 2 here due to being susceptible to bricking and also being Ash Blossom'd due to the Special Summon effect, but feel free to run 3."

Being able to hit for heavy damage can happen too, through cards like Just Desserts, Blazing Mirror Force and Ring of Destruction.  Draw power (like Balance of Judgment) is used to be able to continue playing after your initial burn cards early in the duel.  I don't feel this is the optimal version of the deck, although I'm not completely sure where I want to make changes. I think that Pot of Extravagance could work well as Draw Power, as I barely use my Extra Deck. Dark Room of Nightmare could be a nice card to use to help deal lots of chip damage. Maybe even Mystic Mine to stop opponents' attacks.  Ojama Trio presents a weakness in this deck, as the opponent can use the Tokens for (consecutive) Link Summons. Ojama Trio only works well if you have a Just Desserts alongside it (or Secret Blast/Barrel as a weaker version). Even then, the opponent can still use your Tokens for Link Summons. Due to this, Super Polymerization can be useful alongside Ojama Trio, getting rid of two of them while Summoning First of the Dragons, which can be hard to get rid of."

I don't know if this deck is meta level(probably not), but it is very easy and funny to use.  You can either go first to put goliath on the field and locking your opponent's extra deck( and yours, but it don't matter), or going second to try an OTK or pressuring your opponent with powerful dragons.  Dragon's mirror is not essentially used to bring alternative ultimate, but you can do twin burst with it.  Your main extra deck monster are: hieratic seal of the heavenly spheres, blue-eyes spirit dragon and azure-eyes silver dragon, because them can make a strong field presence, by bringing other big dragons or negating/returning your opponent's cards.  In general, this deck is really funny to play, and the weak point of the deck is heavy backrow decks, like altergeist and true draco, but you can win against them because of the effect of dragon spirit of white and arkbrave dragon, that both banish spell/traps on the field(and they are my favorite cards in this deck)."

YGOPRODECK (Going Second) ,"So a couple weeks ago I was talking to ygoprodeck (The owner of this website) about teaming up for a water based deck profile and he agreed! So here it is. This insane going second deck just destroys most boards, some tier 1 decks and most tier 2 decks. The goal of this deck is to go second and OTK your opponent using the synchro monsters and mermail monsters like <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssmegalo"">Mermail Abyssmegalo</a> that can attack twice after tributing another water monster on your field. I'm sure you guys are wondering why not run <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a>? Well because in testing <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> is an instant bait for a negate. Also <a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed</a> was crazy in testing too, sure I may have drawn 1 or 2 of the same cards I put back into the deck sometimes, but it gets you there it really does. And as for <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, it also contributes to the awesomeness of the deck! The banishing of Desires really doesn't hurt you in this deck as much as you'd think it would. When you draw those 2 cards you just kill them so the game ends anyways. Big shoutout to ygoprodeck for helping with this! He came up with the idea of using Synchro monsters for combos like using <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> and any level 7 monster to go into <a data-name=""White Aura Bihamut"">White Aura Bihamut</a> which an be hard to get over a lot of the time. Another combo he came up with is using Instant Fusion to bring out <a data-name=""Sea Monster of Thesus"">Sea Monster of Thesus</a>, and use Neptabyss to go into <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a> and start popping off from there. These combos come up more than you think they would actually. I came up with the Crystron part and being able to turbo out <a data-name=""Crystron Ametrix"">Crystron Ametrix</a> during your opponent battle phase to stop them from attacking can be helpful. Overall this deck has tons of utility and breaking board power. Hope you guys enjoy!"

So i would recommend using Dark Summoning Beast on Hamon and Raviel.  &nbsp;  However, there are some Fiends(or Spell Cards that let you summon Fiend Tokens) in the deck, so you can summon Raviel also quit easily.  You can also summong other high level monsters (such as Tragoedia, Neosphere and Metaltron) with ease.  The traps cards and continous Spell cards also be used as tributes for Metaltron, giving him extra protection. And he allows you to summon a Fusion, Synchro or XYZ-monster once he gets destroyed.  The Tricky is in the deck to get more Continous Traps in the grave for Uria."

However after playing with the original deck, I decided to change its focus to the most powerful card on the extra deck, the Quintet Magician.  Quintet Magician has a powerfull ground cleaning effect (when summoned using 5 DIFFERENT spellcasters) and comes with 4500 atk and def.  In order to summon him you'll need 5 spellcaster monsters and the spellcard magicalize fusion.  The deck comes with plenty different spellcaster monsters, all with usefull effects.Â The primary goal is to have as many as you can in or field and/or GY (without compromising your field presence, which you can easilly accomplish by using the deck as normal chaos or dm oriented deck - soul eternal and dark magical circle are your best friends) and use magicalize fusion to summon quintet.  In order to draw magicalize fusion easilly, not only have I made this deck extra short but I also added upstart goblin (optional) and synchro fusionist (which you can combine with witch of the black rose to summon tempest magician), which when destroyed as synchro material, allows you to pick a fusion card in your deck.  &nbsp;  I'm not sure if this deck should be considered meta or no but it works pretty damn well against 90% decks I've played against (it's not updated to the new Link format thou) because it's super consistent (and you can make it even more if you decide to remove a few copies of the most recurrent cards) and has great synergy."

Another Guardragon deck. #BanElpy","<em><strong>Opening</strong></em>  I wish I could remember who it was I saw on YouTube that mentioned, if you're playing a Rogue Deck, you shouldn't have people complaining about unfair engines. You're playing jank, if you want to win, you have to do some underhanded shit.  Enter; Abyss Actor Guardragon. I've tossed around with every other form of Summoning after my 10 year hiatus, but never with Pendulum until this deck. I was thinking that I liked the challenge of trying to make this one something all my own, as just about every other Pendulum list out there was Magician/Endymion based, with the rare Odd-Eyes variant sprinkled in. But not a word of Abyss Actor, outside of how it's a crime that literally all of their cards have been imported but <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Twinkle Littlestar"">Abyss Actor - Twinkle Littlestar</a>, which it is... for Pure Abyss Actor, at least. Through the couple of weeks of testing I've pushed this deck through, I've found several things.  1: Most Abyss Actors suck. Despite how much I enjoy their aesthetics, gameplay, and general themes, my lord did they not transition well into Master Rule 4. The lack of a true Link Monster dedicated to their playstyle, most of their effects restricting you to only Abyss Actor <em>Pendulum</em> monsters (which makes even a Link Monster a difficult thing to save them), only two of their good monsters have really usable scales, and justÂ <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Extras"">Abyss Actor - Extras</a> fills your Extra Deck and sets up your scales at the same time, puts you in a pretty rough position as a brewer. However...  2: <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Comic Relief"">Abyss Actor - Comic Relief</a> is absolutely nuts. Generally speaking, your Abyss Scripts also tend to suck on their front side, but my god their effects that trigger if your opponent hurls a blind MST at them are insane. Comic Relief solves literally every problem with Abyss Scripts on his own. If he's Scale'd while targeting another copy of himself, the combos are disgusting. The scale kills himself in the process, meeting your Scripts' requirement of being destroyed while you have an Actor ""On Stage"" (Face-Up in Extra), you take their best monster (Spell effect targeting, too. So you can even steal stuff like <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>), and you get to pop a script of your choosing while the original monster is now under your opponent's control, so you'll get the effect as-if your opponent was doing it. All the while being a Scale 8, which the deck sorely desires. This guy makes <a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a> feel playable in 2019. What a time to be alive.  3: If it doesn't perform well after enough workaround, just jam Guardragons in. We get it. This engine's insane and honestly requires very little investment if you aren't that focused on the Extra Deck. <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a> and <a data-name=""Guardragon Agarpain"">Guardragon Agarpain</a> with their partner in crime, <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, allow you to do some of the dumbest combos to bait out Hand Traps so this Turn 3 deck gets to really shine. If you eat through your opponent's responses with Plan A, Plan B is a sure-fire way to get going and OTK without even needing <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> as backup. Full combo will be listed below, but now it's time for the card-by-card.  <em><strong>Monsters</strong></em>  <a data-name=""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"">Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Mythical Beast Jackal King"">Mythical Beast Jackal King</a>, <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a>, and <a data-name=""Timegazer Magician"">Timegazer Magician</a>: The most generic ways of filling your Extra Deck and giving bodies for your <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> while keeping your Normal Summon open. Jackal King has the added benefit of being a walking <a data-name=""Divine Wrath"">Divine Wrath</a>Â and can Summon back Master Cerberus for additional utility. Not quite enough to warrant putting him to 3, but he more than pulls his own weight. Feels especially good that a Master Cerberus brought back by Jackal King's ability counts as Material for <a data-name=""Zefra Metaltron"">Zefra Metaltron</a>, giving you another zone to work with if you can fit it in early enough of your combos.  <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Superstar"">Abyss Actor - Superstar</a>: Despite what I said about Comic Relief earlier, this one certainly pulls his weight and then some. You'll rarely, if ever, use his Pendulum effect, but his Monster half is pretty bonkers. When going against the odd Altergeist or Subterror player, him protecting your Pendulum Summons from the likes of <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> is not to be ignored. Pulling your Abyss Scripts from the deck as well and setting them to work in tandem with Comic Relief or the <em>true</em> leading lady, Mellow Madonna, saves your ass over and over. Trust me, while Comic Relief does all the work behind the scenes, he commands Center Stage.  <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna"">Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna</a>: I honestly don't know how this deck was meant to function before Legendary Duelists: White Dragon Abyss was printed. She's your searcher, your 0 scale, a swarmer, and doesn't even have a bad stat line. I don't know what else to say.  <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a>, <a data-name=""Supreme King Gate Zero"">Supreme King Gate Zero</a>, <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a>: Your Guardragon enablers. Destrudo's your primary search off of Elpy to go nuts, while Darkwurm tends to get summoned from the bin to search for Zero, then get linked into Electrumite and Pendulum'd back as your Elpy material.  <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser"">Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser</a>, <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Extras"">Abyss Actor - Extras</a>: Not gonna lie, seeing Curtain Raiser being the only used Abyss Actor is what got me so intrigued by the archetype. These tend to just be free bodies to start your plays, but Curtain Raiser's effect isn't too bad if you get wiped and live. Extras, while locking you into Actors for the turn, is honestly just really good at turning a bricked hand into something playable by Scaling a Mellow Madonna from deck and then using her search.  <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Comic Relief"">Abyss Actor - Comic Relief</a>: I gave enough reason why he's here up top. Card's bonkers.  <em><strong>Spells</strong></em>  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>: The deck does occasionally want a bit more selection, and while this does go neutral in card economy, it does dig pretty deep at 2 cards. I have been tempted to take the risky +1 play ofÂ <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, or going back to old testing where I was rolling <a data-name=""Pendulum Halt"">Pendulum Halt</a>. In the former's case, well, it's Desires in a deck with one-ofs. And as for Halt, I'm primarily trying to use this slot to un-brick bad openers, and Halt being active means I'm already doing what I should be. For what it's worth, I DO think Halt is good in Pure Abyss Actor, but here... not so much.  <a data-name=""Abyss Script - Rise of the Abyss King"">Abyss Script - Rise of the Abyss King</a>: The best Script, not even close. The only one I feel is worth it to run more than 1, this is an unstoppable board wipe that if hit with a blind MST, allows you to search for TWO Abyss Actors and/or Scripts. Free wipe, or a +2 when popped early. Beautiful.  <a data-name=""Abyss Script - Opening Ceremony"">Abyss Script - Opening Ceremony</a>: The fact that the front half of this card is a legitimate win condition with current Time Procedures is filthy. Oh, and the fact that face-down it turns into a +5 is too. This is a legal card with a Draw 5. If that's not a selling point on this Archetype, I don't know what is.  <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a>, <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a>: Almost exclusively here for Guardragon setup and extension.  <em><strong>Extra Deck</strong></em>  <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a>: Generally the monster you end on with your full combo, though getting it off of Absolute Dragon is also quite good. Might move this back up to 2 and cut the Crystal Wing.  <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a>: Currently running this instead of the 2nd copy of Vortex Dragon, this is being used as my primary thing to hit off of Agarpain. If it underperforms, I'll just switch back.  <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>: Guardragon Combo.  <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>: Honestly, after upping Rise of the Abyss King to 3, I don't think I've had to Summon this once. I'll give her another week or so before she gets cut.  <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>: I don't know what it is about this card in particular, because I'm not huge on its art, its first effect, or its summoning requirements, but there's just something about that second effect that feels way more fun than it should. Summoning this and then using it as Link Material feels like cheating.  <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>: The deck has no issue with performing an OTK, and would rather just care about more resilience. Hence why <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>'s more possessive, less pointy brother is here. Not a bad card to rip off of Agarpain either if you know the matchup can't really deal with him.  <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a>: Alright, I was a naysayer on this card for the longest time and I don't for the life of me know why. Every time I've tested a deck and wanted a different Link 3, he's there. A disgustingly resilient threat? Got that too. Non-targeting, non destruction removal? Yep. This card kind of does it all and its current pricetag as-of writing this at $74 is pretty justified.  <a data-name=""Zefra Metaltron"">Zefra Metaltron</a>: Link 3 with all down arrows and spot removal in one? Don't mind if I do.  <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Guardragon Agarpain"">Guardragon Agarpain</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a>, <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a>: Your usual suspects when it comes to Guardragon combos. Pretty self-explanatory stuff, with the notable fact that Triple Burst can deny Sky Striker Ace - Raye's revival trigger when it runs over one of their Link Monsters.  <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>: Holy crap why does this thing have so much positive text? Why are its only restrictions its materials and a HOPT on its draw trigger? No wonder you're at 1.  <a data-name=""LANphorhynchus"">LANphorhynchus</a>: Two Link Arrows on a stick. Would kill to have this be a second Electrumite, or for our end board to be more DARK Monsters so I could use <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a>. <em>While typing this, I remembered <a data-name=""Beat Cop from the Underworld"">Beat Cop from the Underworld</a> is a thing, and should probably be running that instead of these.</em>  <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a>: Ban this sick filth.  <em><strong>Side Deck</strong></em>  Build this for however you need it to. Only card I'd hard recommend is <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, as it allows you to board break other Guardragon-esque combos with ease. While the deck isn't <em>reliant </em>on itsÂ Normal Summon, bricking is certainly a thing that will force you into it and sometimes just playing <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a> and passing won't cut it. The other thing is that this is still, at the end of the day, a Pendulum Deck, which requires you using significantly more resources from your hand than most other decks in the meta. Toss in the fact that you're playing a worse deck than what the current field is used to, and you'll have a bad time if you use resource-heavy answers like <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>. Stick to <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> or <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>Â for single-target back row removal, or if you really just need to clear out back row as hard as possible, <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a>'s your card. A large boon this deck has in games 2 and 3 for Traps out of the board is that once your opponent realizes you're on a deck like Abyss Actor that WANTS its back row to be popped, they'll be very wary of any back row you have out of the board for fear that it could be a game-ending Abyss Script trigger.  <em><strong>The Combo</strong></em>  The current combo I've got going to the best effect looks like this: <ol>  	<li>Summon two bodies on board, one of them being <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a>, search for <a data-name=""Supreme King Gate Zero"">Supreme King Gate Zero</a>.</li>  	<li>Link the two together for <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. Electrumite trigger will send either a Scale 8, a Lv6 or lower Monster or Darkwurm if you couldn't get him out in the first step.</li>  	<li>Set a Scale and pop it with Electrumite if you're still missing your 8 Scale.</li>  	<li>Scale your 0 and 8, and Pendulum Summon out your Darkwurm to the bottom-right of Electrumite, your Lv6 or lower Monster, and whatever else you can, at least one more body.</li>  	<li>Link Darkwurm into <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a>Â in the same Main Monster Zone.</li>  	<li>Link Electrumite and your freebie body into <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>Â in the same Extra Monster Zone.</li>  	<li>Activate Elpy's Ignition Effect to Special Summon <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a>.</li>  	<li>Link Triple Burst and Destrudo into <a data-name=""Guardragon Agarpain"">Guardragon Agarpain</a>Â in the same Extra Monster Zone.</li>  	<li>Activate Agarpain's Ignition Effect to Special Summon <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a>.</li>  	<li>Link Agarpain and Elpy into <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a> in either Extra Monster Zone, his Triggered Effect searching for <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a>.</li>  	<li>Activate Destrudo's Ignition Effect in the bin, targeting your Lv6 or lower Monster, and Special Summon itself, reducing level accordingly.</li>  	<li>Synchro the Destrudo and the Lv6 or lower Monster into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a>, using his Triggered Effect to Special Summon your 0 Scale (all are Lv7).</li>  	<li>Overlay Meteorburst and your Lv7 into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>.</li>  	<li>Link Romulus and Absolute into <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a>, Absolute's Triggered Effect will Special Summon <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> from your Extra Deck.</li> </ol> Ending board of 2~3 negates, a bounce, and whatever other good stuff you setup. This is just a tutorial for the basic combo the deck can pull off game-to-game.  <em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em>  While the Abyss Actor cast does have very little to offer overall, what the stars do is quite exciting. Comic Relief allows you to break boards you have no right doing so, Superstar gives you plenty of utility as well as protection against control decks, Mellow Madonna un-bricks you like no other, your Scripts make every anti-back row not-named <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>Â or <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> quake in fear, and Curtain Raiser with Extras is one of the more fun combo starters I've had the pleasure of playing with. You are fairly resilient to hand-traps, being a Pendulum deck, but sometimes you are your own worst enemy, as bricking with this deck <strong>hurts</strong>, and is a little more often than I'd like. All-in-all, it's a fun deck to play, and definitely feels unique when you have the cast and crew put on a solid performance. But if the show can't go on, just burn the stage down with Dragons. At least until Elpy gets banned.

You can't rely just on the solitaire nonsense because it is not ultra consistent.</li>  	<li>3x Worse Raider - this deck is Eagle turbo because Eagle turns your Fire fist monsters in loops Cyclical Worm holes on steroids. Don't run Coyote</li>  	<li>1x Dogman is just another cute beast warrior drop. I am to scared to play 2 but it wouldn't be a mistake per say</li>  	<li>3x Dragons - Dragons is a fine draw.. Not great but not bad either and YOU do need 3 for optimal looping, I would play less if I could but its impossible to do so.</li>  	<li>2x Bear - Bear is a combo piece slightly worse combo piece then Dragoon but can do some stuff going second. He pops the TIGER KING.. So a key card.</li>  	<li>1x Buffalo - You are either sending this with Eagle or Bear / Rooster so that you can revive them of Dragons. Eagle can put a free level 4 with him in the deck.</li>  	<li>1x Ganesha - Every long combo access this card from deck. YEP DECK.</li>  	<li>1x Zoodiac Thoroughblade / Kataroost (Kataroost can stop monster targeting against R4 Beast warriors while Thorough blade is better if you draw 2 barrage)</li>  	<li>3x Elephant... Unloads the hand, one of the best draws</li>  	<li>2x Rooster... Fine draw due to Elephant but you mainly wanna summon him after 4th or 5th Tiger King Cycle (Yep sounds wierd)</li>  	<li>1x Wolfbark - THE FORGOTTEN BOI.... summon him and bear after first tiger king destruction... summon another tigerking then do double dragoon cycle then the 3rd dragoon with arvata then the double Rooster (Thats roughly how you Tiger KING loop)</li>  	<li>3x Raven - free fire formation spell ... plz try to summon Eagle over that Salamangreat link1</li>  	<li>1x Eland - once you Learn how to play this deck this card ain't hard to drop.. a ritual monster which negates a card</li>  	<li>3x Tensu - a card I want to draw the most</li>  	<li>3x Tenki - amazing</li>  	<li>1x Domei - Ritual enabler + reviver</li>  	<li>1x Ingen - Fusion enabler + add backer</li>  	<li>1x Liang Peak - search it mid combo and drop Heraklinos on the same turn</li>  	<li>2x Fire formation Yoko - discard a Bwarrior pop a face up card. (Going second fire formation keeps consistency high)</li>  	<li>2x Onslaught of the fire kings - I run this over handtraps combos with raven...</li>  	<li>2x Dark ruler no more - I want more going second power</li>  	<li>3x Ash I want more going second power r3 adds him back</li>  	<li>1x Sinto. You can access to but Consistency &gt; overkill. EvenÂ  ""non super loopy combos"" can access 2 but the card is so conditional as well its tilting. Its Opt to</li> </ul> As far as if any maindeck changes are possible in order to improve the main deck. I very much doubt it  &nbsp;  Extra deck <ul>  	<li>2X Eagle - you can only summon 1 per turn but you need the second one for next turn...</li>  	<li>3x Tiger King - In my previous Fire fist 5 negate showcase I run 2... I jump to 3 it turns into 9 negate deck with more loops. So go figure if you need all 3.</li>  	<li>1x Appolousa - For non basic combos which happen 30%-40% of a time. The deck is optimized for the panda route. MANDATORY</li>  	<li>1x Heraklinos - No Leo dancer doesn't come close due to description which I hope you had read. Another non OPT card oh boi. Mandatory</li>  	<li>1x Fire fist swan - Protects Appolousa / Ganesha so randomly more relevant then one would expect this card to be. MANDATORY. You should try toÂ  make the most powerful board possible under Panda restriction. He does make those 2 negate boards a bit better... I am already not playing 2nd sinto I need him.</li>  	<li>1x Fire fist cardinal - this card IS FKING amazing, like a double castel on steroids. MANDATORY</li>  	<li>1x Diamond Dire - non targetting removal + relevant for tiger king combos since he can pop him</li>  	<li>1x Lion Emperor - Reccomended, Pluses in long combo, adds back ash, might get replaced if we ever get anything better which might take years.</li>  	<li>1x Daruma Doll - beast warrior so you can go into eagle after. ""knightmare phoenix"" of a deck if you will but can plus. Strongly reccomended</li>  	<li>1x Almiraj - see raven MANDATORY</li>  	<li>1x security dragon - not mandatory but I HATE FKING BAGOOSKA. This is here to counter bagooska against salamangreats but many run dweller so think of it as a free spot...</li>  	<li>1x Peacock - Unclogs board but so does the fusion and the ritual. Thing is he unclogs it the easiest oh the effects barely matter but aren't the worst.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"
