Linewalker,"<p>Hey there. In this deck, we will be looking at an aspiring shooter, Performapal Extra Slinger. He is so good that I call him ""Sogeking"" alongside his mentor, Linewalker. Let me show you how to play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu13yRkZn9A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker.</p><p>2) Have 10 Pendulum Monsters placed into Extra Deck as face-up.</p><p>3) Place Extra Slinger on Pendulum Zone and do your best shot with him for lethal finish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- While the plan is simple, you need to be careful with Extra Deck monsters in addition to their abilities and some of Pendulum Monsters. First, let's take a look at Extra Deck summon hierarchy. You need to follow the list or you might mess up:</p><p>1) If you open up with Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda, this is how you can play with...</p><ul><li>Monk + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Level 1 Tuner &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>2) If you start only with Panda, this is how you can play with:</p><ul><li>Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Panda/Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk/Panda + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Then, we can have a look at key cards for better performance...</p><ul><li><strong>Astrograph Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>One of those staples for any Pendulum based decks and this deck is no different. Since you have Pendulum Monsters that can auto-detonate themselves, which are Momoncarpet and Nobledragon, it won't be too hard to activate the effect of Astrograph to Special Summon. If you have one of those auto-detonated monsters in your deck, you can tutor any. Note that in order to activate all of his abilities, switch the activation confirmation button to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"" to not miss any timing. Otherwise, ""Magician of Hope"" can cheat him out.<ul><li>Since it costs UR to craft, I can understand your hesitance. In that case, add third copy of Nobledragon (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performapal Lizardraw:&nbsp;</strong>You can destroy this card, only if you have another Performapal in your Pendulum Zone. So, place Lizardraw first and then, Momoncarpet. Activate Lizardraw to destroy itself and draw a card. Momoncarpet will detonate itself due to its ability, don't worry about it.</li><li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:&nbsp;</strong>Another staple for any Pendulum based decks like Astrograph. As seen above the Extra Deck summon guide, you need to use Nirvana and Rockks as materials. You can deliver one of your Pendulum Monsters to Extra Deck as face-up, which thins your deck. When one of your monsters in Pendulum Zone is destroyed, you can draw a card. Electrumite is so amazing that it sadly lead into its ban in TCG.<ul><li>For that reason, if one day Electrumite is going to be also banned in Master Duel or if you don't have UR mats to craft Electrumite, you can either skip crafting Electrumite or try Pendulum Treasure (SR) for its face-up ability as a substitute.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bujinki Ahashima:&nbsp;</strong>This card is used alongside ""Magician of Hope"" XYZ Pendulum Monster. All you need is 2 x Level 1 monsters and a free zone where Electrumite points to. Upon Link Summon, you have to activate its ability and pull out one Level 4 monster from GY and one Level 4 monster from your hand. Thus, you have to Link Summon Bujinki when you have Level 4 monsters in both areas. With Level 4 monsters present, you will XYZ Summon ""Magician of Hope"" with these two only. Then, if you like, destroy Bujinki with Electrumite for convenience because Bujinki can't be used as Link material for Saryuja and/or Cross-Sheep, which might cause disturbance later on.<ul><li>If you don't want to craft Bujinki, which costs SR, you can cut Bujinki + Magician of Hope to add Mythical Beast Bashilisk (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Symphonic Warrior Rockks:</strong> Since there are few Level 7 Extra Deck Pendulum Monsters, I decided to add this one. Rockks has similarities with Electrumite, where you can add face-up Pendulum Monsters from Extra Deck to your hand.<ul><li>Since it costs SR to craft, perhaps you don't want to craft Rockks. In that case, Mythical Beast Garuda (N) shall serve you well.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker:</strong> Until Rockks is present, don't try to Special Summon him because this deck values every single board space needed. After you have tutored Cusillu with him, prioritize on tributing Pendulum Monsters for Cusillu. It will be Astrograph + Magician of Hope, if you <a href=""https://youtu.be/Wu13yRkZn9A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>watch</strong></a> the video.</li><li><strong>Cross-Sheep:&nbsp;</strong>It's here to deliver Pendulum Monsters from field to Extra Deck, if you use Pendulum Monsters as Link material.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Astrograph Sorcerer"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"" can be found within ""Those Who Stand Against Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Bujinki Ahashima"" can be found within ""Bujin's Vault of Heaven"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- If you have read the guide, you don't have to craft ""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Well, this deck accomplishes what you want with little beetles called Number 13 and Number 31. After all, they are literal embodiment of ""Crime and Punishment"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti9O6mzOk9c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Let ""Black Garden"" plant five roses to opposing side.</p><p>2) Special Summon Twinkle with Saryuja and give it to opponent with ""Creature Swap""...</p><ul><li>It can be also done with ""Geonator Transverser"" but you need to setup your board accordingly. If you must, remove Ravenous and add Geonator.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 13 and Number 31. If needed, don't hesitate to play ""Tri-Wight"" to pull out 3 x Level 1 dudes from your GY since Saryuja let you free up three Main Monster Zones by Link Summoning Saryuja alone.</p><p>4) Place ""Burning Bamboo Sword"" and then, activate ""Broken Bamboo Sword"" on Twinkle. It's needed to skip your opponent's Main Phase 1 to not let them play anything...</p><ul><li>If interested, same setup can be also done with Amorphactor + Earth Chant but I prefer Bamboo Sword duos because those spells can grant boost for ""Mage Power"".</li></ul><p>5) Equip ""Mage Power"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Psychic Blade"" on Twinkle to boost its ATK by big margin. Then, end your turn.</p><p>6) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate the abilities of Number 13 and Number 31. By detaching one of mats from both beetles, your opponent's monsters will be into Attack Position and all of them will have to attack your beetles, including Twinkle. In addition, when Number 13 and 31 are together, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effects and your opponent will take any battle damage you normally would. Combine it with Twinkle attacking three times in total and you can see the picture clearly now...</p><ul><li>To not miss any timing, change activation confirmation to ""ON"". You can change these settings in-game by choosing ""Switch + Hold"" and manually adjusting required button.</li></ul><p>7) In short, let Twinkle attack into either Number 13 or Number 31 by force three times to self OTK themselves. Thus, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Creature Swap"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 30 UR! You don't have to craft ""United We Stand"", if you are low on UR. I hope you were lucky to have these cards beforehand.</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"
