Linewalker,"<p>Hey there. In this deck, we will be looking at an aspiring shooter, Performapal Extra Slinger. He is so good that I call him ""Sogeking"" alongside his mentor, Linewalker. Let me show you how to play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu13yRkZn9A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker.</p><p>2) Have 10 Pendulum Monsters placed into Extra Deck as face-up.</p><p>3) Place Extra Slinger on Pendulum Zone and do your best shot with him for lethal finish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- While the plan is simple, you need to be careful with Extra Deck monsters in addition to their abilities and some of Pendulum Monsters. First, let's take a look at Extra Deck summon hierarchy. You need to follow the list or you might mess up:</p><p>1) If you open up with Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda, this is how you can play with...</p><ul><li>Monk + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Level 1 Tuner &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>2) If you start only with Panda, this is how you can play with:</p><ul><li>Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Panda/Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk/Panda + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Then, we can have a look at key cards for better performance...</p><ul><li><strong>Astrograph Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>One of those staples for any Pendulum based decks and this deck is no different. Since you have Pendulum Monsters that can auto-detonate themselves, which are Momoncarpet and Nobledragon, it won't be too hard to activate the effect of Astrograph to Special Summon. If you have one of those auto-detonated monsters in your deck, you can tutor any. Note that in order to activate all of his abilities, switch the activation confirmation button to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"" to not miss any timing. Otherwise, ""Magician of Hope"" can cheat him out.<ul><li>Since it costs UR to craft, I can understand your hesitance. In that case, add third copy of Nobledragon (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performapal Lizardraw:&nbsp;</strong>You can destroy this card, only if you have another Performapal in your Pendulum Zone. So, place Lizardraw first and then, Momoncarpet. Activate Lizardraw to destroy itself and draw a card. Momoncarpet will detonate itself due to its ability, don't worry about it.</li><li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:&nbsp;</strong>Another staple for any Pendulum based decks like Astrograph. As seen above the Extra Deck summon guide, you need to use Nirvana and Rockks as materials. You can deliver one of your Pendulum Monsters to Extra Deck as face-up, which thins your deck. When one of your monsters in Pendulum Zone is destroyed, you can draw a card. Electrumite is so amazing that it sadly lead into its ban in TCG.<ul><li>For that reason, if one day Electrumite is going to be also banned in Master Duel or if you don't have UR mats to craft Electrumite, you can either skip crafting Electrumite or try Pendulum Treasure (SR) for its face-up ability as a substitute.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bujinki Ahashima:&nbsp;</strong>This card is used alongside ""Magician of Hope"" XYZ Pendulum Monster. All you need is 2 x Level 1 monsters and a free zone where Electrumite points to. Upon Link Summon, you have to activate its ability and pull out one Level 4 monster from GY and one Level 4 monster from your hand. Thus, you have to Link Summon Bujinki when you have Level 4 monsters in both areas. With Level 4 monsters present, you will XYZ Summon ""Magician of Hope"" with these two only. Then, if you like, destroy Bujinki with Electrumite for convenience because Bujinki can't be used as Link material for Saryuja and/or Cross-Sheep, which might cause disturbance later on.<ul><li>If you don't want to craft Bujinki, which costs SR, you can cut Bujinki + Magician of Hope to add Mythical Beast Bashilisk (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Symphonic Warrior Rockks:</strong> Since there are few Level 7 Extra Deck Pendulum Monsters, I decided to add this one. Rockks has similarities with Electrumite, where you can add face-up Pendulum Monsters from Extra Deck to your hand.<ul><li>Since it costs SR to craft, perhaps you don't want to craft Rockks. In that case, Mythical Beast Garuda (N) shall serve you well.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker:</strong> Until Rockks is present, don't try to Special Summon him because this deck values every single board space needed. After you have tutored Cusillu with him, prioritize on tributing Pendulum Monsters for Cusillu. It will be Astrograph + Magician of Hope, if you <a href=""https://youtu.be/Wu13yRkZn9A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>watch</strong></a> the video.</li><li><strong>Cross-Sheep:&nbsp;</strong>It's here to deliver Pendulum Monsters from field to Extra Deck, if you use Pendulum Monsters as Link material.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Astrograph Sorcerer"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"" can be found within ""Those Who Stand Against Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Bujinki Ahashima"" can be found within ""Bujin's Vault of Heaven"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- If you have read the guide, you don't have to craft ""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Well, this deck accomplishes what you want with little beetles called Number 13 and Number 31. After all, they are literal embodiment of ""Crime and Punishment"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti9O6mzOk9c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Let ""Black Garden"" plant five roses to opposing side.</p><p>2) Special Summon Twinkle with Saryuja and give it to opponent with ""Creature Swap""...</p><ul><li>It can be also done with ""Geonator Transverser"" but you need to setup your board accordingly. If you must, remove Ravenous and add Geonator.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 13 and Number 31. If needed, don't hesitate to play ""Tri-Wight"" to pull out 3 x Level 1 dudes from your GY since Saryuja let you free up three Main Monster Zones by Link Summoning Saryuja alone.</p><p>4) Place ""Burning Bamboo Sword"" and then, activate ""Broken Bamboo Sword"" on Twinkle. It's needed to skip your opponent's Main Phase 1 to not let them play anything...</p><ul><li>If interested, same setup can be also done with Amorphactor + Earth Chant but I prefer Bamboo Sword duos because those spells can grant boost for ""Mage Power"".</li></ul><p>5) Equip ""Mage Power"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Psychic Blade"" on Twinkle to boost its ATK by big margin. Then, end your turn.</p><p>6) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate the abilities of Number 13 and Number 31. By detaching one of mats from both beetles, your opponent's monsters will be into Attack Position and all of them will have to attack your beetles, including Twinkle. In addition, when Number 13 and 31 are together, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effects and your opponent will take any battle damage you normally would. Combine it with Twinkle attacking three times in total and you can see the picture clearly now...</p><ul><li>To not miss any timing, change activation confirmation to ""ON"". You can change these settings in-game by choosing ""Switch + Hold"" and manually adjusting required button.</li></ul><p>7) In short, let Twinkle attack into either Number 13 or Number 31 by force three times to self OTK themselves. Thus, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Creature Swap"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 30 UR! You don't have to craft ""United We Stand"", if you are low on UR. I hope you were lucky to have these cards beforehand.</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

But you may find that you will end up with for example: Sangan and 1 KOTS in your hand and you'll be stuck with having to send KOTS to search for poly then not be able to make the fusion monster, if you find they're bricking to much then you can just side KOTS and Poly out for something else (Book of Moon and Royal Command).

Don't banish it with Panda by accident as well...</p><ul><li>However, you can banish other Ghostrick cards with Panda, which are Field Spells. Don't let them stuck in GY or you can't fetch them with ""Primal Seed"" later on.</li><li>Also, you can tutor said field spells with Ancient by destroying whatever was present in Field Zone.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon ""Ghostrick Dullahan"" by using 2 x Level 1 monsters. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find banished Ghostrick cards and retrieve Book cards with ""Primal Seed"" to use the ability of Mischief time and time again.</p><p>4) Remember ""Ghostrick Shot"" and ""Ghostrick Renovation"" being in GY?

When Mischief has 10 materials, you win the duel.</li><li>As explained before, retrieve banished Ghostrick cards with ""Primal Seed"" by targeting ""Primal Seed"" first and then any Ghostrick card.</li><li>Mischief's hand-attachment ability isn't hard once per turn. As long as we flip her up and down with Book spells, we can use her hand-attachment ability as much as we can, until she has 10 materials. Don't forget to find Book spells with ""Primal Seed"" as well.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What a lovely finish! I would love to save up some SR and UR points, how about you? If so, keep reading:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Not only does the deck have increased consistency and more in-archetype summons, Kashtira now has a clear win condition, the ""Macro-Cosmos + Drident"" on legs, and destroyer of worlds, metagames and strategies - Ariseheart!</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Ariseheart by himself is a format warping monstrosity since it renders ALL graveyard centred strategies null and void! Not only is he very beefy with a 3000+/3000+ ATK/DEF statline, he can target banish anything on the field as a quick effect, dealing with anything on-field that endangers him! Finally, his XYZ materials will never run out, since he can attach everything from the banish pile (even face-down cards!) everytime something gets banished, which will happen very often in duels with Kashtira.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Unfortunately, Masterduel's banlist has immediately hit the consistency of pure Kashtira on-release with the limit of Pressured Planet Wraitsoth and the ban of Terraforming not so long ago, so that's three full starters that is not in the deck! Pot of Prosperity has also been limited to 1, which is unfortunate since the card was very free to activate in Kashtira due to not needing their Extra Deck much.

(Covered in the next section below).&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">To increase the deck's consistency, <strong>NON-KASHTIRA</strong> cards are included like 2 Psi-Beast, 2 Planet Pathfinder and 1 Reinforcement of the Army. Of course, 1 Pot of Prosperity is included (would have been 3 if not for the banlist). Triple Tactics Thrust, also a new card from Flames of Fury can also grab from deck Kashtiratheosis which can summon a Kashtira from deck given you have a target on the field.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">10 <strong> KASHTIRA </strong>monsters are present in this deck - even 1 Ogre, 1 KashScareclaw and 1 KashTear so that you have as many names possible to be used with Kashtiratheosis.

This way, you can punish your opponent even more for handtrapping you, especially with Maxx ""C."" Also, going second you have more chances to break boards so that you can actually play the game. Thankfully, TTThrust also can search for Kashtiratheosis, further increasing consistency in the deck.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: center;""><strong class=""ContentPasted2 ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">The win condition of this deck is Ariseheart. On top of being a midrange control beatdown deck, this strategy now turbos out its floodgate boss monster to completely shut the opposing player down of plays (Kashtira is basically another flavour of Floowandereeze). That being said, Kashtira is a classic example of a ""Protect the Castle"" strategy -&nbsp; that castle in this case is Ariseheart. Despite it's beefy stats, quick effect banish and floodgate effect, Ariseheart has no inherent protection, making it fragile.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Also, Shangri-Ira's field-lockdown may be annoying for most players, but a full-field lock isn't nearly as possible nowadays with the pre-emptive ban of Diablosis.

Be methodical on how you break boards with this deck - use Main Phase 1 and the Battle Phase in it's full potential. After carefully breaking your opponent's board and baiting out interruption, you can then proceed to full combo into this deck's hero - Ariseheart!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you lose the ""Maxx C minigame,"" this deck can easily pass on simple boards such as Unicorn + Fenrir + Birth. Full comboing to Ariseheart isn't worth giving your opponent 4+ extra cards.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Appointer of the Red Lotus gives back your opponent's card at the next End Phase. If you stuff the card under Ariseheart as XYZ material when it gets banished, you get to keep it permanently and they will not get their card back!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you use Pot of Prosperity and Ariseheart is already in the field, banish Infinitrack Goliath and the Fossil cards. Ariseheart can attach these cards and gain various benefits! If Goliath is attached, it cannot be destroyed by card effects. if Fossil Wagon or Skull Knight get attached, if Ariseheart leave the field they will go to the GY and become a S/T destruction or monster destruction respectively.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">In this format, it's good to shotgun Maxx ""C"" and Dimension Shifter in the draw phase, since you won't get a chance to chain to a Kashtira's inherent summon. Also, lots of Triple Tactics Talent is running about with Thrust in the card pool.&nbsp;</li><li><em style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted9"">Want to see the deck in action?

The identity of the deck changed from beatstick control to floodgate banish turbo, invalidating most GY-oriented decks forever warping ladder (until a banlist invevitably shafts this deck lol). With Flames of Fury release, Kashtira truly will unleash hell on Masterduel Ladder and on every duelist unfortunate enough to face it. Perhaps we'll experience another Tier 1 format for the next couple months again (oh joy)!&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><p><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Like hyper-consistent decks? Gishki Spright is here for you!,"<p>With a still unbanned Spright Elf running around, Spright is one of the strongest engines right now. Now the question remains, who is poised to abuse this engine the best?</p><p>Why, a bunch of freaky fish guys (and girls), of course!</p><p>Gishki Engine:</p><ul><li>3x Gishki Grimness. This card represents a 1 card combo into Neremanas and Spright Red/Carrot, as it summons any (non-Ritual) Gishki straight from your deck, so always run as many copies as possible. Always summon Abyss off its effect.</li><li>2x Gishki Abyss. Searches out any &lt;1000 DEF Gishki besides Abyss, which is everything but Neremanas in this deck. Not a once per turn, so you can revive it to search multiple times in a single turn.</li><li>2x Gishki Vision. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Monster.</li><li>2x Gishki Shadow. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Spell.</li><li>2x Evigishki Neremanas. It's our boss monster, and absolute menace. Immediately reborns a Gishki on summon to allow you to continue comboing, big body, immune to destruction by battle from ED summoned monsters, and of course the monster negate by bouncing herself back to hand. No hard once per turns either, so you can use all of these multiple times.</li><li>3x Focused Aquamirror. Searches any Gishki monster you want. Typically we grab Grimness, but Neremanas or Shadow can also be worth grabbing if you need one of those more. The end phase effect should be used to set Aquamirror Illusion, as it allows us to double negate with Neremanas during the following turn.</li><li>1x Gishki Aquamirror. The most basic Ritual Spell, the one that... probably won't get used that often. It's great if you have a spare Grimness/Vision/Shadow in hand, as they can be used as the whole requirement for a Ritual, but otherwise it's mostly just our backup plan on turn 3 after we've spent our LP on the other two Ritual Spells.</li><li>1x Gishki Photomirror. Spend 5k LP to summon Neremanas with this bad boy. We only ever use this card once per duel thanks to this, so only one copy is needed.</li><li>1x Gishki Nekromirror. Tributing your opponent's monsters for material is always a good thing to have, as it allows us to out problem cards like Ariseheart.</li><li>1x Aquamirror Illusion. Lets you summon Neremanas straight from your hand for no cost, usually used to resummon Neremanas after you've spent her negate to let her negate again.</li></ul><p>Spright Engine:</p><ul><li>2x Spright Blue. Searches a Spright monster on Special, SS's itself for free if you control a Level/Rank 2.</li><li>1x Spright Jet. Searches our Spright Spell/Traps, all three of them in this deck. Also a free body.</li><li>1x Spright Red. Our other monster negate tool, less important in this deck since we have Neremanas but still extremely useful. Still confused on why the orange one is named Red while the red one is named Carrot.</li><li>1x Spright Carrot. Our primary S/T negate, generally the one I go for when I'm doing the Grimness one card combo.</li><li>2x Spright Starter. Be careful with it, since it can lock you out of Neremanas if you use it before you summon her. Otherwise, lets you do wacky Spright things.</li><li>1x Spright Smashers. I have actually not resolved this once yet in this deck. Still extremely useful, since a non-targeting banish is something you'll really benefit from in this format.</li><li>2x Gigantic Spright. Bit less important in this brew than other Spright builds, still extremely strong. You cannot use this to start a Gishki combo, as it locks you into 2s for the rest of the turn (meaning no Neremanas without hard drawing Aquamirror Illusion to summon her next turn).</li><li>2x Spright Elf. Enables us to one card combo into Neremanas from Grimness, then protects Neremanas and lets you generate a lot of advantage over the turns with its revival effect.</li><li>1x Spright Sprind. Honestly I don't actually use this card that often, but we have a lot of space in the ED and it can occasionally help.</li></ul><p>Non-engine is just various assorted good stuff, replace as you see fit to combat the meta. Kaijus or Kurikara Divincarnate would be really good this format, but the exact specifics I leave to you to decide.</p><p>Rest of the ED (everything but I:P can be replaced to suit preferences and the meta at hand):</p><ul><li>1x Downerd+ZEUS. Backup plan, you should very rarely ever need to be summoning them but they're handy to have.</li><li>1x Accesscode Talker. OTK push go brr.</li><li>1x I:P Masquerena. Generally a frequent staple of my high roll end boards, one of the best ED cards here since you can go into a lot of options.</li><li>1x Knightmare Unicorn. I:P target, summon when you need a card off the field.</li><li>1x Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. I:P target, summon when you need something that's a borderline Towers or fight through anything and everything while protecting you from battle damage.</li><li>1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World. I:P target and general out to enemy Towers-type monsters (or anything too scary that we just need gone without using traditional removal.</li><li>1x Onibimaru Soul Sweeper. Another board breaking tool, haven't summoned this yet myself.</li><li>1x Topologic Zeroboros. Bit of a... unorthodox pick. OTK tool, boardbreaker, I:P target in certain situations. Haven't summoned this yet, but I wanted to use this for something and figured this would be a solid place for it.</li><li>1x Salamangreat Almiraj. Honestly I'm probably cutting this going forward. The situations where I'd use it are extremely narrow and I'd rather have a toolbox to out problem boards. Still usable, especially if you run more revive tools than I do (since you can NS Abyss, search, send it by linking it for Almiraj, then resummon it with your revive to search again, guaranteeing access to Neremanas).</li></ul><p>We have a lot of combos to go into various big boards. The most relevant one, though is our Grimness one card combo and the one I'll touch upon. Steps go as so:</p><ol><li>(optional) Use Focused Aquamirror to search Grimness.</li><li>NS Grimness, SS Abyss. Use Abyss effect to search out Vision/Shadow.</li><li>Link both Grimness and Abyss for Spright Elf.</li><li>Spright Elf effect revive Abyss.</li><li>Abyss effect search out Vision/Shadow (whichever one you didn't grab with the first search).</li><li>Use Vision and Shadow to search Neremanas and a Ritual Spell (if you do not have a spare Vision/Shadow/Grimness in hand, search Photomirror, otherwise grab Aquamirror)</li><li>Use your Ritual Spell to summon Neremanas, revive Grimness or Vision.</li><li>Overlay Abyss+Grimness/Vision for Gigantic Spright.</li><li>Use Gigantic to SS Blue from Deck.</li><li>Blue search Jet.</li><li>SS Jet, grab Starter.</li><li>Use Starter, SS Carrot/Red. I usually summon Carrot, as we already have a monster negate on board.</li><li>(optional but highly recommended) Link off Blue/Jet/Gigantic for I:P Masquerena.</li><li>(if you used Focused Aquamirror) During End Phase, set Aquamirror Illusion.</li></ol><p>This nets you a monster negate (two if you set Aquamirror Illusion), a spell negate, and I:P Masquerena. That's off one card. Obviously handtraps can make your day miserable (we cannot play through Droll or Dimensional Shifter, and you need a relatively lucky hand to make Neremanas under Maxx C without giving your opponent way too many cards), but we can play through Imperm and Ash with little trouble on lucky hands. And if you don't draw into the Gishki stuff, you can still make a pretty solid Spright endboard in some situations, or just use your non-engine to stall for a bit until you can kill.</p>"

As long as you attach at least 10 materials to Digital Bug Corebage, you can make it to the top with C9 for fatal explosion.)</p><p>Hey! These insects are bugging me. Let's flip them up and down, shall we?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/jH5FkSa.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>First of all, although not seen in this picture, Special Summon ""Digital Bug Websolder"" with Saryuja. Then, activate Websolder's ability to change battle position of a monster you have -from Attack to Defense- to bring forth second Websolder from your hand. Then, XYZ Summon Scaradiator by using 2 x Websolder as materials.</li><li>Then, use Saryuja and any monster but Chaos/Scaradiator/Panda to Link Summon Reprodocus and line Scaradiator behind it.</li><li>Don't forget to place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. It's needed to find Books and Rank-Up spells with ""Primal Seed"" duo, that's why.</li><li>Also, play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; Rebirth Judgment"" combo to change the type of every monster in GYs to ""Insect"".</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) As seen above, ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" was played. It was to bring forth ""Digital Bug Corebage"", our main worker for this deck:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/cbEKohd.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/YpckOFP.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/MaHjOsh.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see from these three pictures, in order to attach a material to Corebage, battle position of monster(s) has to be changed. By turning Panda face-down, we can gladly do so. Oh, we have to pick a monster which has to be ""Insect"" but we already got it covered with ""Rebirth Judgment"" trick.</li><li>The ability of Corebage isn't hard once per turn. So, as long as we reset Corebage by flipping up and down, we can change battle position of Panda to attach another monster as many times as time limit allows. Try to aim for at least 10 materials...<br /><ul><li>Fortunately for you, ""Primal Seed"" duo can find Book spells in addition to Astral Force because your job isn't over yet.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) When you have attached at least 10 materials to Corebage, activate Astral Force to bring forth Rhinosebus. Then, change its type to ""Machine"", which allows you to bridge into Number 9 with Astral Force for last time. Finally, seal the game by activating Barian's Force to bring forth Number C9:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/edwB243.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/y1vtKpU.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/IEYspfg.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/YQsUIGn.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/SoggCin.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/gve2PQv.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/4Gd7U1R.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/h9fO2lz.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>For context, total damage inflicted was 300 x 13 + 800 x 13 = 14300 damage, which results into FTK with a bit overkill.</li><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/yOJH9K37sw0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Digital Bug Scaradiator"" and ""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"" can be collected for free, if you have acquired ""Growing Digital Bug"" structure pack from PvE mode in ""Digital Bugs in Cyberspace"" chapter to save 30 SR and 30 UR!

Panda+Arcana+Starving Venoms,"<p>Greetings! I have brought you a puzzle-worthy deck, where you will be bamboozled. It's about bypassing the text of ""Independent Nightingale"", which mentions ""unaffected by other cards' effects"", meaning that you can't negate Independent so easily. What if I told you there is a workaround? If <a href=""/deck/342724"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Supreme</strong></a>&nbsp;is going to be banned in Master Duel one day, which is already the case in TCG but not in OCG for some reason, this deck will achieve exactly the same play-style but with some extras as Starving Venoms. Let's jump in!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the situation as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/ctPgMpG.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>For context, Arcana was Special Summoned with Saryuja. When ""Light Barrier"" is present, you can change the outcome of Arcana to&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to always skip your opponent's turn at the cost of delivering two monsters you control to GY. These will be Panda and Spirit.<ul><li>To not miss out anything, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li></ul></li><li>You don't have to bring forth Assembled and Venemy on first turn but I did it anyways. Note that you have to place Assembled onto Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) and Venemy on Main Monster Zone (MMZ). You will see why later on.<ul><li>To place Assembled on EMZ, you have to destroy Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"".</li></ul></li><li>Don't forget to place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find key cards with ""Primal Seed"". As long as you target ""Primal Seed"" each other alongside combo pieces, everything will be fine.</li><li>Also, set ""Fiendish Chain"" and ""Primal Seed"". Since ""Into the Void"" was played beforehand, every spell will be banished instead of being delivered to GY thanks to ME-PSY-YA. Thus, it's vital to have ""Primal Seed"" with you.</li><li>Although not seen in this picture, either discard Beatraptor + Risebell with Ravenous or have them in your hand to be delivered to GY via ""Into the Void"" later on.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Thanks to Arcana, it's your turn now. There is still much to do:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/I1plzGC.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>In this picture, you can see every combo pieces you are going to use. ""Fusion Tag"" will be the most important one.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) First, we can start bringing forth Independent Nightingale:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/72qKgZD.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/dwwtR9l.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/j5O74wE.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/FR7lw5c.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/xCtiJXF.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/19H60t3.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>In these pictures, you can see ""Fusion Tag"" being used on Flamvell to change its name into ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"". Mind you, in order to Fusion Summon ""Independent Nightingale"", you need ""Assembled Nightingale"" and one any Lyrilusc monster. Since ""Independent Nightingale"" is a Lyrilusc monster, you can cheat out Independent with Assembled + Flamvell, all thanks to editing name of a monster you control with ""Fusion Tag"". Crazy, ain't it?</li><li>Remember the situation about Independent, which was about ""unaffected by other cards' effects""? By placing Independent on EMZ while Beatraptor is around, you can completely negate her, as long as Independent is present only on EMZ. To make her completely negated wherever she will be, activating ""Fiendish Chain"" and targeting on Independent will be enough. She can't be a free bird anymore and will be imprisoned by Starving Venom brothers, coming soon 😂</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) Then, time to bring forth other Starving Venom brothers, namely ""Starving Venom"" and ""Odd-Eyes Venom"":</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/fluMhTT.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Since all Starving Venom brothers can only target your opponent's monsters on the battlefield, you have to give your opponent Independent with ""Shien's Spy"" first.</li><li>Then, Fusion Summon ""Odd-Eyes Venom"" on EMZ. As explained in #3, you can change names of monsters you control with ""Fusion Tag"". Target one with ""Starving Venom"" and other one with ""Odd-Eyes Venom"". Since those monsters have ""Starving Venom"" and ""Odd-Eyes"" in their names, you can cheat out ""Odd-Eyes Venom"".</li><li>Finally, Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom"" by having two DARK monsters on the field. Simply revive either 2 x Exodia pieces or 2 x Monks with ""Monster Reborn"" and use them as Fusion Materials. There is no need for ""Fusion Tag"" for this one...<ul><li>In order to let ""Starving Venom"" copycat Independent like his other brothers, you have to raise the level of Independent to 5 or above. Fortunately, Risebell can raise her level and it's not hard once per turn. Thus, revive and destroy Risebell with ""Monster Reborn"" and Offerings to do what you have to do.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5) Copycat Independent with Starving Venom brothers. Afterwards, pull the trigger with everyone to shoot your opponent down for fatality:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/RZA887n.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/N1OYOim.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/7ISkBq_mHU4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6) In case your opponent is still alive and you need to take extra turns with Arcana, here is the order without breaking your setup:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/g9Ygi1y.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/0BE3RuQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/MAhzG9o.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/BumI8t8.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>These pictures describe a ""what if"" scenario, not what was actually transpired on Ranked. Done on PvE mode but still holds water for Ranked as well.</li><li>To sum up, you need to use the ability of Arcana to send ""Starving Venom"" and Exodia piece first. Then, return Independent to your home.</li><li>Then, like before, give Independent to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"" and raise its level with Risebell. Afterwards, revive ""Starving Venom"" with ""Monster Reborn"" and play as usual.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial before to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Beatraptor"" can be found within ""Prehistoric Beast Advance"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Assembled Nightingale"" + ""Independent Nightingale"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" can be found within ""Draconic Resplendence"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Swordmaster is able to lend others his abilities because of this. Spiritmaster shares the importance of the grace God has given them by the purification of God&rsquo;s fire. Spectral sword is the spirit of their leader who is able to assist others via the waters of the Holy Spirit. Blacksmith reflects the importance of God in their lives due to how their weapons are made. Shade is supposed to be the old sins of the group that have been tried in the fire but Squire has to learn how to use it to not sin and is technically no longer needed. And Squire doesn&rsquo;t really want to battle because of Shade until she realizes the importance of her role. Solitaire isn&rsquo;t really needed either but he tries to remind the Shiranui of the importance of the other Shiranui sharing what God has done for them with the message to not rely on satan and to submit to the will of God.<br /><br />Their spells/traps are expressions of what God has done in their lives. Ghost meets girl is a testament of the hospitality of the Shiranui when your opponent has a monster. Samsara is the promise of God that we will be born again in water and made pure in His fire. Style Success is the importance of how God forgives us of our sins because of Jesus baptizing us in the spirit since we will be reborn in water and have our sins removed by God&rsquo;s righteous fire. Style Synthesis is the blessing from God that God has imbued onto Shiranui&rsquo;s leader to pass onto the other members of the Shiranui: the importance of telling others of God&rsquo;s promises and living faithfully according to this.</p>"

That said, my current step is testing considerations for the second Superdora over the Gustav (it's good for an easy OTK, but OTKs come pretty easily to this deck anyway) or the Gadget (un-bricks some bad hands, but we're trying to reduce the chances of those bad hands anyway).</p>"

Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>It's no joke that Kashtiras are crazy. After attaching lots of materials with <a href=""/deck/371025"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Arise-Heart</strong></a>, I decided to commit another crime with Kashtiras. This time, it will be with Shangri-Ira. Combined with ""Gift Exchange"" which banishes cards face-down, in addition to other block cards, your opponent won't be able to do anything. Time to bring chaos!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/2d3XLvk.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Make sure you have lots of Main Monster Zone (MMZ) free. Link Summoning Saryuja and using Ravenous will help in that regard.</li><li>Although I went first in this game, if you go second, play ""Raigeki"" to free up MMZ of your opponent's and ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" to clear all spells/traps your opponent controls.</li><li>Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find your banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo.</li><li>Set cards were as follows:<ul><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies activation of Field Spells.</li><li><strong>Primal Seed:&nbsp;</strong>We will find banished cards.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Gift Exchange:&nbsp;</strong>Your zone blocker card for Shangri-Ira.</li></ul></li><li>The reason as to why we set those cards is that ""Lavalval Salamander"" will be Synchro Summoned. After that, Lavalval will draw 2 cards. Since we don't have any FIRE monster in the hand, Lavalval will shuffle every card from hand to deck, which equates into resources for ""Gift Exchange"" and naturally, Shangri-Ira. Thus, it's wiser to keep whatever we can.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Synchro Summon ""Lavalval Salamander"" by using Cthugua + Martial as materials. Then, XYZ Summon ""Kashtira Shangri-Ira"" by using Lavalval + Ancient as materials:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/v2Y7SjQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see, 19 cards will be returned from hand to deck. You need at least 10 cards for ""Gift Exchange"" and Shangri-Ira, which is more than enough.</li></ul><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/FCmGGoO.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>While banishing cards within your deck as face-down, target combo pieces first. For example, Angel O7, which denies the activation of Effect Monsters but only if you Tribute Summon Angel O7. Otherwise, it won't work and Tribute Summon after your job is done with ""Gift Exchange"" and Shangri-Ira...<ul><li>Fortunately for you, ""Primal Seed"" doesn't discriminate whether you have banished your cards as face-up or face-down. As long as it is banished, you can retrieve it.</li><li>Theoretically, you can retrieve said cards with ""Primal Seed"" to not give your opponent any because they will be either sent to GY or delivered to Banish Zone (BZ) as face-up, if you activate ""Into the Void"" at End Phase. Yet, time is ticking, so don't try to waste any more time than you should.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) After banishing every single zone your opponent has with ""Shangri-Ira"" and ""Gift Exchange"" duo, reach the board state as shown and end your turn:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/uyBKnUn.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>""Primal Seed"" and ""Mask of Restrict"" were set. Remainder doesn't matter, you don't have to set every card.</li><li>Just to recap, here is what you have as ""blockers"" against your opponent...<ul><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira:</strong> Denies zones your opponent has.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>ME-PSY-YA:&nbsp;</strong>Spells and traps will be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of spells/traps that can activate from BZ.</li></ul></li><li>Also, to not miss out anything, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) On your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/OD3YGh7.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/Ks9tjpB.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/FbSvyKuwVO8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" + ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" can be found within ""Glory on Wings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Hope you were lucky to find at least one copy to save 30 SR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

It's needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" duo.</p><p>2) When your Main Deck has no cards, Fusion Summon ""The Dark Magicians"" by using ""King of the Swamp"" and a Spellcaster (Exodia/Monk) monster as materials.</p><p>3) Fill your board with monsters thanks to ""Monster Reborn"". Then, shuffle ""DNA Transplant"" with ""The Humble Sentry"". This setup was needed to draw your only card, which is a Trap card to activate at will, thanks to ""The Dark Magicians"". Activate it when your side of board is full to change the attributes of all monsters to LIGHT.</p><p>4) Destroy ""The Dark Magicians"" with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive with ""Monster Reborn"". This is needed to reset ""The Dark Magicians"", so that we can do what was explained in #3 but for ""Solar Ray"" to continuously deal 3600 damage in total.</p><p>5) Rinse and repeat what was explained in #4 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

Yet, did you know that you can also convert incoming damage to healing with Oracle King, where you can reflect it to your opponent as damage with Number 43? I bet you didn't, which is why I would like to show you a setup I made with ""Skull Invitation"". Let's jump in!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSFulPtfn5c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, either send ""Infernity Sage"" to GY with Dugares or Special Summon it with Saryuja.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. Just don't banish any one of three Level 2 DARK monsters by accident with Chaos Emperor Dragon, which are needed for XYZ Summon of 2 x Number 43 monsters...</p><ul><li>ME-PSY-YA and Chaos are perfect duo for retrieving banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo. As long as you target each other, you can make larger and larger hand.</li></ul><p>3) Destroy Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and Fusion Summon Oracle King to where Saryuja was, which is Extra Monster Zone (EMZ). To do so, activate Swirl when you also have Ghost in-hand because you need to use both monsters as Fusion materials for Oracle King.</p><p>4) Revive Ghost + Swirl + Sage with ""Monster Reborn"" and XYZ Summon Number 43. Then, destroy it with Offerings and revive the trio for another time for second Number 43, which will be also destroyed.</p><p>5) Revive both Number 43 monsters and Sage. Then, by using ""Primal Seed"" duo, have at least 25-30 cards in your hand.</p><p>6) Play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; Skull Invitation"" combo. Don't trigger Number 43 when asked to due to ""Skull Invitation"" until you activate Sage.</p><p>7) Destroy ME-PSY-YA with ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" and activate Sage. What is going to happen is that Sage will discard your whole hand and you would normally take big chunk of damage with ""Skull Invitation"". However, thanks to Oracle King, you will convert incoming damage to healing. Then, you can pull the trigger with both Number 43 monsters to convert healing into damage against your opponent to win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""D/D Swirl Slime"" can be found within ""Cross-Dimensional Contracts"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found within ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

(2022 Copium Build?),"<p>A surprisingly consistent and fun going first build. Would recommend giving it a test run on YGO Omega before committing. The deck aims to use various engines and special summoning to play through disruption. Maxx C should arguably be used in the deck, however the P.U.N.K. field spell is usually a +2 to +3 into the engines so it doesn't seem as necessary with the P.U.N.K. package, as well as Maxx C is shut down once Arise-Heart is on the field. The Adventure engine alongside Kashtira allows for Nibiru safe combos. Simply special summon Unicorn, then activate Rite of Aramesir or Water Enchantress to search for Aramesir, and run the Adventure combo. The ideal hand is something similar to Rite of Aramesir, Emergency Teleport, and Kashtira Unicorn. This hand is safe from Nibiru, as well as can survive Unicorn being Imperm'd due to P.U.N.K. backup plays being available with Emergency Teleport. The Zombie Vampire can be used in the P.U.N.K. combo to mill for special summoning of Kashtira Unicorn or Firewall Guardian for DPE Scythe Lock or Kashtira plays. DPE cannot be summoned in conjunction with the full Kashtira combo line, due to RiseHeart Xyz lock, however DPE can be used freely in the P.U.N.K. lines after all P.U.N.K. combos have been completed. DPE can be summoned with Kashtira Arise-Heart on the field only with Fusion Destiny hard drawed. Verte card effect states the Fusion spell must be sent to the GY, of which Arise-Heart will not allow, nullifying Verte's secondary effect while Arise-Heart is on the field. The DPE Scythe lock combo can be ran alongside the Adventure engine, as Firewall Guardian activates in the GY when linked off, and not on the field. Attached video link to Dkayed's video explaining the 1 card DPE Scythe lock combo, which explains the link monsters in the extra deck and Firewall Guardian in the main deck. Please remember to keep your link zones open however for the DPE Scythe lock combo. Feel free to modify this deck as it is experimental, and arguably oversaturated with engines, however this is my fun deck. Enjoy, and remember to always have fun.&nbsp;</p>"

To the aim that is this, you basically just play a regular Chaos deck, only with a bunch of stall cards to achieve that aim. The point, naturally, is that the opponent shouldn't know what you are doing until it's too late; this is why the deck is specifically geared to look like a ordinary Chaos deck, it's to essentially make them think otherwise on this plan and play normally. We only need two cards to get the deck aim; Wall to reduce our life points enough to activate Self-Destruct.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to deal with the inevitable potential negation, multiple measures are made. Trunade at three lets us just force out any potential interactions without even needing to negate anything, and if they don't waste resources on it, great! That just makes the job much easier. Fake Trap is also a very weird but very effective option, allowing us to midigate big backrow destruction and buy time, as does the presence of triple Solemn. Other than that, the deck more or less functions in a conventional fashion. You could honestly win games without even needing the stall stipulation.</p><p>Side-deck is also quite important; you can side out the stall antics to go into a regular Chaos deck...in which case it functions as a smokescreen to a opponent who's probably focused on siding out backrow counters like Royal Degree or more Dust Tornados. Of course the deck is also perfectly fine throwing in some potential Burn if that's needed as well, using the meta of 3x Wave-Motion and Koala to confuse things further. I did once use this to draw games like what, 7 times in a row? I guess you can do that as well lol</p><p>Point is, just goof off with the deck. Smartly, mind you, but always try to mix what the deck is doing here and there, it's more useful than you think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Try to get at least 10 materials attached to Plump or it might not be enough to win with C9 later on.)</p><p>Greetings! It's time unleash Catzilla and have a blast with C9 later on. If interested, keep reading!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/tZzIkgx.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>""Banisher of the Light"" was Special Summoned by Saryuja. Also, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon and have Ravenous with you. At one point, you will destroy Banisher, that's why...<ul><li>Actually, you don't have to use Banisher. Instead, if you have, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone. Since ME-PSY-YA costs UR to craft and I don't have two of those, I had to use Banisher as a substitute.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Then, Link Summon Reprodocus by using Panda + Saryuja as materials:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/WFy45OQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/J8MS21b.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see from these two pictures, you have to XYZ Summon Plump by using Nemeses + Formula as materials. Also, place him right behind Reprodocus, you will see why later on.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Since every card will be sent to Banish Zone (BZ) instead of GY, you can retrieve banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo. Fetch as many spells as you can, minimum 10 excluding combo pieces, with ""Primal Seed"" duo and then, destroy ""Banisher"" with Ravenous...</p><ul><li>Or, ME-PSY-YA, but only if you have two of them and placed one of them to Pendulum Zone beforehand.</li></ul><p>4) Then, play ""Spell Reproduction"" to discard two of your spells to GY and target ""Spell Reproduction"" to have it with you. This setup actually causes a loop. When you have discarded at least 10 spells except combo pieces, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone.&nbsp;</p><p>5) With ME-PSY-YA present, it's time to switch to ""Primal Seed"" setup. First, attach spells from GY to Plump. Then, use Book spells to reset its ability to do it again and retrieve Books with ""Primal Seed"" duo. After you have attached at least 10 spells, overlay into Happiness but don't forget to place behind Reprodocus:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/lXtyDaO.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/50t7oH0.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6) Then, change the type of Happiness to ""Machine"" with Reprodocus. Now, you can lead the way to C9. Play ""Astral Force"" for Number 9 and ""Barian's Force"" for C9.

Also, don't forget to activate the ability of ""Abyss Dweller"" to block the activation of anything within your opponent's GY. It's crucial to be not disturbed.</p><p>2) Special Summon Bone Tower with Saryuja, right behind its Extra Monster Zone. Then, Normal Summon Meiru. Afterwards, Link Summon Reprodocus, right above Bone Tower.</p><p>3) Activate Reprodocus and change the attribute of Bone Tower to anything other than LIGHT and DARK. Reason is that we don't want Bone Tower being negated by Meiru.</p><p>4) Activate ""Zombie World"" alongside ""Dark Room of Nightmare"" + ""Paralyzing Chain"". Then, Special Summon Turbo Booster. Since everything on the field and in the GYs become Zombie, you can mill your opponent with any kind of Special Summon, in addition to burning your opponent to death with Nightmare and Chain.</p><p>5) What makes it endless is returning Booster to your hand with Birdman. Although Meiru negates the effects of LIGHT and DARK monsters, it doesn't negate their costs. So, Birdman can return Booster to your hand (cost) and Birdman can stay in your hand instead of Special Summoning to the field (effect) thanks to negate of Meiru, since Birdman is a DARK monster...</p><ul><li>Simply put, Birdman and Booster can use their effects forever.

Then, replace one of Exodia pieces with Incarnate.</p><p>3) Target ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Incarnate to adjust the level of your monsters to 10. Then, excluding Chaos, XYZ Summon 2 x Number 35 by using 4 monsters as materials.</p><p>4) Either Special Summon Lantron with Saryuja or via ""Monster Reborn"", if you have sent Lantron to GY with Dugares/Ravenous.</p><p>5) Give your opponent 2 x Number 35 monsters with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>6) Revive any monster with ""Monster Reborn"". What is going to happen is that 2 x Number 35 monsters will deal 2 x 600 = 1200 damage in total because you have Special Summoned a monster.
