Linewalker,"<p>Hey there. In this deck, we will be looking at an aspiring shooter, Performapal Extra Slinger. He is so good that I call him ""Sogeking"" alongside his mentor, Linewalker. Let me show you how to play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu13yRkZn9A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker.</p><p>2) Have 10 Pendulum Monsters placed into Extra Deck as face-up.</p><p>3) Place Extra Slinger on Pendulum Zone and do your best shot with him for lethal finish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- While the plan is simple, you need to be careful with Extra Deck monsters in addition to their abilities and some of Pendulum Monsters. First, let's take a look at Extra Deck summon hierarchy. You need to follow the list or you might mess up:</p><p>1) If you open up with Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda, this is how you can play with...</p><ul><li>Monk + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Level 1 Tuner &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>2) If you start only with Panda, this is how you can play with:</p><ul><li>Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Panda/Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk/Panda + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Then, we can have a look at key cards for better performance...</p><ul><li><strong>Astrograph Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>One of those staples for any Pendulum based decks and this deck is no different. Since you have Pendulum Monsters that can auto-detonate themselves, which are Momoncarpet and Nobledragon, it won't be too hard to activate the effect of Astrograph to Special Summon. If you have one of those auto-detonated monsters in your deck, you can tutor any. Note that in order to activate all of his abilities, switch the activation confirmation button to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"" to not miss any timing. Otherwise, ""Magician of Hope"" can cheat him out.<ul><li>Since it costs UR to craft, I can understand your hesitance. In that case, add third copy of Nobledragon (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performapal Lizardraw:&nbsp;</strong>You can destroy this card, only if you have another Performapal in your Pendulum Zone. So, place Lizardraw first and then, Momoncarpet. Activate Lizardraw to destroy itself and draw a card. Momoncarpet will detonate itself due to its ability, don't worry about it.</li><li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:&nbsp;</strong>Another staple for any Pendulum based decks like Astrograph. As seen above the Extra Deck summon guide, you need to use Nirvana and Rockks as materials. You can deliver one of your Pendulum Monsters to Extra Deck as face-up, which thins your deck. When one of your monsters in Pendulum Zone is destroyed, you can draw a card. Electrumite is so amazing that it sadly lead into its ban in TCG.<ul><li>For that reason, if one day Electrumite is going to be also banned in Master Duel or if you don't have UR mats to craft Electrumite, you can either skip crafting Electrumite or try Pendulum Treasure (SR) for its face-up ability as a substitute.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bujinki Ahashima:&nbsp;</strong>This card is used alongside ""Magician of Hope"" XYZ Pendulum Monster. All you need is 2 x Level 1 monsters and a free zone where Electrumite points to. Upon Link Summon, you have to activate its ability and pull out one Level 4 monster from GY and one Level 4 monster from your hand. Thus, you have to Link Summon Bujinki when you have Level 4 monsters in both areas. With Level 4 monsters present, you will XYZ Summon ""Magician of Hope"" with these two only. Then, if you like, destroy Bujinki with Electrumite for convenience because Bujinki can't be used as Link material for Saryuja and/or Cross-Sheep, which might cause disturbance later on.<ul><li>If you don't want to craft Bujinki, which costs SR, you can cut Bujinki + Magician of Hope to add Mythical Beast Bashilisk (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Symphonic Warrior Rockks:</strong> Since there are few Level 7 Extra Deck Pendulum Monsters, I decided to add this one. Rockks has similarities with Electrumite, where you can add face-up Pendulum Monsters from Extra Deck to your hand.<ul><li>Since it costs SR to craft, perhaps you don't want to craft Rockks. In that case, Mythical Beast Garuda (N) shall serve you well.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker:</strong> Until Rockks is present, don't try to Special Summon him because this deck values every single board space needed. After you have tutored Cusillu with him, prioritize on tributing Pendulum Monsters for Cusillu. It will be Astrograph + Magician of Hope, if you <a href=""https://youtu.be/Wu13yRkZn9A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>watch</strong></a> the video.</li><li><strong>Cross-Sheep:&nbsp;</strong>It's here to deliver Pendulum Monsters from field to Extra Deck, if you use Pendulum Monsters as Link material.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Astrograph Sorcerer"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"" can be found within ""Those Who Stand Against Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Bujinki Ahashima"" can be found within ""Bujin's Vault of Heaven"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- If you have read the guide, you don't have to craft ""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Well, this deck accomplishes what you want with little beetles called Number 13 and Number 31. After all, they are literal embodiment of ""Crime and Punishment"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti9O6mzOk9c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Let ""Black Garden"" plant five roses to opposing side.</p><p>2) Special Summon Twinkle with Saryuja and give it to opponent with ""Creature Swap""...</p><ul><li>It can be also done with ""Geonator Transverser"" but you need to setup your board accordingly. If you must, remove Ravenous and add Geonator.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 13 and Number 31. If needed, don't hesitate to play ""Tri-Wight"" to pull out 3 x Level 1 dudes from your GY since Saryuja let you free up three Main Monster Zones by Link Summoning Saryuja alone.</p><p>4) Place ""Burning Bamboo Sword"" and then, activate ""Broken Bamboo Sword"" on Twinkle. It's needed to skip your opponent's Main Phase 1 to not let them play anything...</p><ul><li>If interested, same setup can be also done with Amorphactor + Earth Chant but I prefer Bamboo Sword duos because those spells can grant boost for ""Mage Power"".</li></ul><p>5) Equip ""Mage Power"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Psychic Blade"" on Twinkle to boost its ATK by big margin. Then, end your turn.</p><p>6) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate the abilities of Number 13 and Number 31. By detaching one of mats from both beetles, your opponent's monsters will be into Attack Position and all of them will have to attack your beetles, including Twinkle. In addition, when Number 13 and 31 are together, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effects and your opponent will take any battle damage you normally would. Combine it with Twinkle attacking three times in total and you can see the picture clearly now...</p><ul><li>To not miss any timing, change activation confirmation to ""ON"". You can change these settings in-game by choosing ""Switch + Hold"" and manually adjusting required button.</li></ul><p>7) In short, let Twinkle attack into either Number 13 or Number 31 by force three times to self OTK themselves. Thus, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Creature Swap"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 30 UR! You don't have to craft ""United We Stand"", if you are low on UR. I hope you were lucky to have these cards beforehand.</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

But you may find that you will end up with for example: Sangan and 1 KOTS in your hand and you'll be stuck with having to send KOTS to search for poly then not be able to make the fusion monster, if you find they're bricking to much then you can just side KOTS and Poly out for something else (Book of Moon and Royal Command).

Don't banish it with Panda by accident as well...</p><ul><li>However, you can banish other Ghostrick cards with Panda, which are Field Spells. Don't let them stuck in GY or you can't fetch them with ""Primal Seed"" later on.</li><li>Also, you can tutor said field spells with Ancient by destroying whatever was present in Field Zone.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon ""Ghostrick Dullahan"" by using 2 x Level 1 monsters. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find banished Ghostrick cards and retrieve Book cards with ""Primal Seed"" to use the ability of Mischief time and time again.</p><p>4) Remember ""Ghostrick Shot"" and ""Ghostrick Renovation"" being in GY?

When Mischief has 10 materials, you win the duel.</li><li>As explained before, retrieve banished Ghostrick cards with ""Primal Seed"" by targeting ""Primal Seed"" first and then any Ghostrick card.</li><li>Mischief's hand-attachment ability isn't hard once per turn. As long as we flip her up and down with Book spells, we can use her hand-attachment ability as much as we can, until she has 10 materials. Don't forget to find Book spells with ""Primal Seed"" as well.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What a lovely finish! I would love to save up some SR and UR points, how about you? If so, keep reading:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Not only does the deck have increased consistency and more in-archetype summons, Kashtira now has a clear win condition, the ""Macro-Cosmos + Drident"" on legs, and destroyer of worlds, metagames and strategies - Ariseheart!</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Ariseheart by himself is a format warping monstrosity since it renders ALL graveyard centred strategies null and void! Not only is he very beefy with a 3000+/3000+ ATK/DEF statline, he can target banish anything on the field as a quick effect, dealing with anything on-field that endangers him! Finally, his XYZ materials will never run out, since he can attach everything from the banish pile (even face-down cards!) everytime something gets banished, which will happen very often in duels with Kashtira.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Unfortunately, Masterduel's banlist has immediately hit the consistency of pure Kashtira on-release with the limit of Pressured Planet Wraitsoth and the ban of Terraforming not so long ago, so that's three full starters that is not in the deck! Pot of Prosperity has also been limited to 1, which is unfortunate since the card was very free to activate in Kashtira due to not needing their Extra Deck much.

(Covered in the next section below).&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">To increase the deck's consistency, <strong>NON-KASHTIRA</strong> cards are included like 2 Psi-Beast, 2 Planet Pathfinder and 1 Reinforcement of the Army. Of course, 1 Pot of Prosperity is included (would have been 3 if not for the banlist). Triple Tactics Thrust, also a new card from Flames of Fury can also grab from deck Kashtiratheosis which can summon a Kashtira from deck given you have a target on the field.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">10 <strong> KASHTIRA </strong>monsters are present in this deck - even 1 Ogre, 1 KashScareclaw and 1 KashTear so that you have as many names possible to be used with Kashtiratheosis.

This way, you can punish your opponent even more for handtrapping you, especially with Maxx ""C."" Also, going second you have more chances to break boards so that you can actually play the game. Thankfully, TTThrust also can search for Kashtiratheosis, further increasing consistency in the deck.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: center;""><strong class=""ContentPasted2 ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">The win condition of this deck is Ariseheart. On top of being a midrange control beatdown deck, this strategy now turbos out its floodgate boss monster to completely shut the opposing player down of plays (Kashtira is basically another flavour of Floowandereeze). That being said, Kashtira is a classic example of a ""Protect the Castle"" strategy -&nbsp; that castle in this case is Ariseheart. Despite it's beefy stats, quick effect banish and floodgate effect, Ariseheart has no inherent protection, making it fragile.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Also, Shangri-Ira's field-lockdown may be annoying for most players, but a full-field lock isn't nearly as possible nowadays with the pre-emptive ban of Diablosis.

Be methodical on how you break boards with this deck - use Main Phase 1 and the Battle Phase in it's full potential. After carefully breaking your opponent's board and baiting out interruption, you can then proceed to full combo into this deck's hero - Ariseheart!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you lose the ""Maxx C minigame,"" this deck can easily pass on simple boards such as Unicorn + Fenrir + Birth. Full comboing to Ariseheart isn't worth giving your opponent 4+ extra cards.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Appointer of the Red Lotus gives back your opponent's card at the next End Phase. If you stuff the card under Ariseheart as XYZ material when it gets banished, you get to keep it permanently and they will not get their card back!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you use Pot of Prosperity and Ariseheart is already in the field, banish Infinitrack Goliath and the Fossil cards. Ariseheart can attach these cards and gain various benefits! If Goliath is attached, it cannot be destroyed by card effects. if Fossil Wagon or Skull Knight get attached, if Ariseheart leave the field they will go to the GY and become a S/T destruction or monster destruction respectively.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">In this format, it's good to shotgun Maxx ""C"" and Dimension Shifter in the draw phase, since you won't get a chance to chain to a Kashtira's inherent summon. Also, lots of Triple Tactics Talent is running about with Thrust in the card pool.&nbsp;</li><li><em style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted9"">Want to see the deck in action?

The identity of the deck changed from beatstick control to floodgate banish turbo, invalidating most GY-oriented decks forever warping ladder (until a banlist invevitably shafts this deck lol). With Flames of Fury release, Kashtira truly will unleash hell on Masterduel Ladder and on every duelist unfortunate enough to face it. Perhaps we'll experience another Tier 1 format for the next couple months again (oh joy)!&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><p><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Like hyper-consistent decks? Gishki Spright is here for you!,"<p>With a still unbanned Spright Elf running around, Spright is one of the strongest engines right now. Now the question remains, who is poised to abuse this engine the best?</p><p>Why, a bunch of freaky fish guys (and girls), of course!</p><p>Gishki Engine:</p><ul><li>3x Gishki Grimness. This card represents a 1 card combo into Neremanas and Spright Red/Carrot, as it summons any (non-Ritual) Gishki straight from your deck, so always run as many copies as possible. Always summon Abyss off its effect.</li><li>2x Gishki Abyss. Searches out any &lt;1000 DEF Gishki besides Abyss, which is everything but Neremanas in this deck. Not a once per turn, so you can revive it to search multiple times in a single turn.</li><li>2x Gishki Vision. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Monster.</li><li>2x Gishki Shadow. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Spell.</li><li>2x Evigishki Neremanas. It's our boss monster, and absolute menace. Immediately reborns a Gishki on summon to allow you to continue comboing, big body, immune to destruction by battle from ED summoned monsters, and of course the monster negate by bouncing herself back to hand. No hard once per turns either, so you can use all of these multiple times.</li><li>3x Focused Aquamirror. Searches any Gishki monster you want. Typically we grab Grimness, but Neremanas or Shadow can also be worth grabbing if you need one of those more. The end phase effect should be used to set Aquamirror Illusion, as it allows us to double negate with Neremanas during the following turn.</li><li>1x Gishki Aquamirror. The most basic Ritual Spell, the one that... probably won't get used that often. It's great if you have a spare Grimness/Vision/Shadow in hand, as they can be used as the whole requirement for a Ritual, but otherwise it's mostly just our backup plan on turn 3 after we've spent our LP on the other two Ritual Spells.</li><li>1x Gishki Photomirror. Spend 5k LP to summon Neremanas with this bad boy. We only ever use this card once per duel thanks to this, so only one copy is needed.</li><li>1x Gishki Nekromirror. Tributing your opponent's monsters for material is always a good thing to have, as it allows us to out problem cards like Ariseheart.</li><li>1x Aquamirror Illusion. Lets you summon Neremanas straight from your hand for no cost, usually used to resummon Neremanas after you've spent her negate to let her negate again.</li></ul><p>Spright Engine:</p><ul><li>2x Spright Blue. Searches a Spright monster on Special, SS's itself for free if you control a Level/Rank 2.</li><li>1x Spright Jet. Searches our Spright Spell/Traps, all three of them in this deck. Also a free body.</li><li>1x Spright Red. Our other monster negate tool, less important in this deck since we have Neremanas but still extremely useful. Still confused on why the orange one is named Red while the red one is named Carrot.</li><li>1x Spright Carrot. Our primary S/T negate, generally the one I go for when I'm doing the Grimness one card combo.</li><li>2x Spright Starter. Be careful with it, since it can lock you out of Neremanas if you use it before you summon her. Otherwise, lets you do wacky Spright things.</li><li>1x Spright Smashers. I have actually not resolved this once yet in this deck. Still extremely useful, since a non-targeting banish is something you'll really benefit from in this format.</li><li>2x Gigantic Spright. Bit less important in this brew than other Spright builds, still extremely strong. You cannot use this to start a Gishki combo, as it locks you into 2s for the rest of the turn (meaning no Neremanas without hard drawing Aquamirror Illusion to summon her next turn).</li><li>2x Spright Elf. Enables us to one card combo into Neremanas from Grimness, then protects Neremanas and lets you generate a lot of advantage over the turns with its revival effect.</li><li>1x Spright Sprind. Honestly I don't actually use this card that often, but we have a lot of space in the ED and it can occasionally help.</li></ul><p>Non-engine is just various assorted good stuff, replace as you see fit to combat the meta. Kaijus or Kurikara Divincarnate would be really good this format, but the exact specifics I leave to you to decide.</p><p>Rest of the ED (everything but I:P can be replaced to suit preferences and the meta at hand):</p><ul><li>1x Downerd+ZEUS. Backup plan, you should very rarely ever need to be summoning them but they're handy to have.</li><li>1x Accesscode Talker. OTK push go brr.</li><li>1x I:P Masquerena. Generally a frequent staple of my high roll end boards, one of the best ED cards here since you can go into a lot of options.</li><li>1x Knightmare Unicorn. I:P target, summon when you need a card off the field.</li><li>1x Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. I:P target, summon when you need something that's a borderline Towers or fight through anything and everything while protecting you from battle damage.</li><li>1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World. I:P target and general out to enemy Towers-type monsters (or anything too scary that we just need gone without using traditional removal.</li><li>1x Onibimaru Soul Sweeper. Another board breaking tool, haven't summoned this yet myself.</li><li>1x Topologic Zeroboros. Bit of a... unorthodox pick. OTK tool, boardbreaker, I:P target in certain situations. Haven't summoned this yet, but I wanted to use this for something and figured this would be a solid place for it.</li><li>1x Salamangreat Almiraj. Honestly I'm probably cutting this going forward. The situations where I'd use it are extremely narrow and I'd rather have a toolbox to out problem boards. Still usable, especially if you run more revive tools than I do (since you can NS Abyss, search, send it by linking it for Almiraj, then resummon it with your revive to search again, guaranteeing access to Neremanas).</li></ul><p>We have a lot of combos to go into various big boards. The most relevant one, though is our Grimness one card combo and the one I'll touch upon. Steps go as so:</p><ol><li>(optional) Use Focused Aquamirror to search Grimness.</li><li>NS Grimness, SS Abyss. Use Abyss effect to search out Vision/Shadow.</li><li>Link both Grimness and Abyss for Spright Elf.</li><li>Spright Elf effect revive Abyss.</li><li>Abyss effect search out Vision/Shadow (whichever one you didn't grab with the first search).</li><li>Use Vision and Shadow to search Neremanas and a Ritual Spell (if you do not have a spare Vision/Shadow/Grimness in hand, search Photomirror, otherwise grab Aquamirror)</li><li>Use your Ritual Spell to summon Neremanas, revive Grimness or Vision.</li><li>Overlay Abyss+Grimness/Vision for Gigantic Spright.</li><li>Use Gigantic to SS Blue from Deck.</li><li>Blue search Jet.</li><li>SS Jet, grab Starter.</li><li>Use Starter, SS Carrot/Red. I usually summon Carrot, as we already have a monster negate on board.</li><li>(optional but highly recommended) Link off Blue/Jet/Gigantic for I:P Masquerena.</li><li>(if you used Focused Aquamirror) During End Phase, set Aquamirror Illusion.</li></ol><p>This nets you a monster negate (two if you set Aquamirror Illusion), a spell negate, and I:P Masquerena. That's off one card. Obviously handtraps can make your day miserable (we cannot play through Droll or Dimensional Shifter, and you need a relatively lucky hand to make Neremanas under Maxx C without giving your opponent way too many cards), but we can play through Imperm and Ash with little trouble on lucky hands. And if you don't draw into the Gishki stuff, you can still make a pretty solid Spright endboard in some situations, or just use your non-engine to stall for a bit until you can kill.</p>"
