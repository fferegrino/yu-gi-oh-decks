Linewalker,"<p>Hey there. In this deck, we will be looking at an aspiring shooter, Performapal Extra Slinger. He is so good that I call him ""Sogeking"" alongside his mentor, Linewalker. Let me show you how to play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu13yRkZn9A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Set your opponent's LP to 3000 with Linewalker.</p><p>2) Have 10 Pendulum Monsters placed into Extra Deck as face-up.</p><p>3) Place Extra Slinger on Pendulum Zone and do your best shot with him for lethal finish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- While the plan is simple, you need to be careful with Extra Deck monsters in addition to their abilities and some of Pendulum Monsters. First, let's take a look at Extra Deck summon hierarchy. You need to follow the list or you might mess up:</p><p>1) If you open up with Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda, this is how you can play with...</p><ul><li>Monk + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Level 1 Tuner &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>2) If you start only with Panda, this is how you can play with:</p><ul><li>Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Panda/Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk/Panda + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Formula = Nirvana &gt;&gt;&gt; Librarian + Formula = Rockks &gt;&gt;&gt; Nirvana + Rockks = Electrumite</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Then, we can have a look at key cards for better performance...</p><ul><li><strong>Astrograph Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>One of those staples for any Pendulum based decks and this deck is no different. Since you have Pendulum Monsters that can auto-detonate themselves, which are Momoncarpet and Nobledragon, it won't be too hard to activate the effect of Astrograph to Special Summon. If you have one of those auto-detonated monsters in your deck, you can tutor any. Note that in order to activate all of his abilities, switch the activation confirmation button to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"" to not miss any timing. Otherwise, ""Magician of Hope"" can cheat him out.<ul><li>Since it costs UR to craft, I can understand your hesitance. In that case, add third copy of Nobledragon (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performapal Lizardraw:&nbsp;</strong>You can destroy this card, only if you have another Performapal in your Pendulum Zone. So, place Lizardraw first and then, Momoncarpet. Activate Lizardraw to destroy itself and draw a card. Momoncarpet will detonate itself due to its ability, don't worry about it.</li><li><strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:&nbsp;</strong>Another staple for any Pendulum based decks like Astrograph. As seen above the Extra Deck summon guide, you need to use Nirvana and Rockks as materials. You can deliver one of your Pendulum Monsters to Extra Deck as face-up, which thins your deck. When one of your monsters in Pendulum Zone is destroyed, you can draw a card. Electrumite is so amazing that it sadly lead into its ban in TCG.<ul><li>For that reason, if one day Electrumite is going to be also banned in Master Duel or if you don't have UR mats to craft Electrumite, you can either skip crafting Electrumite or try Pendulum Treasure (SR) for its face-up ability as a substitute.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bujinki Ahashima:&nbsp;</strong>This card is used alongside ""Magician of Hope"" XYZ Pendulum Monster. All you need is 2 x Level 1 monsters and a free zone where Electrumite points to. Upon Link Summon, you have to activate its ability and pull out one Level 4 monster from GY and one Level 4 monster from your hand. Thus, you have to Link Summon Bujinki when you have Level 4 monsters in both areas. With Level 4 monsters present, you will XYZ Summon ""Magician of Hope"" with these two only. Then, if you like, destroy Bujinki with Electrumite for convenience because Bujinki can't be used as Link material for Saryuja and/or Cross-Sheep, which might cause disturbance later on.<ul><li>If you don't want to craft Bujinki, which costs SR, you can cut Bujinki + Magician of Hope to add Mythical Beast Bashilisk (N).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Symphonic Warrior Rockks:</strong> Since there are few Level 7 Extra Deck Pendulum Monsters, I decided to add this one. Rockks has similarities with Electrumite, where you can add face-up Pendulum Monsters from Extra Deck to your hand.<ul><li>Since it costs SR to craft, perhaps you don't want to craft Rockks. In that case, Mythical Beast Garuda (N) shall serve you well.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Earthbound Greater Linewalker:</strong> Until Rockks is present, don't try to Special Summon him because this deck values every single board space needed. After you have tutored Cusillu with him, prioritize on tributing Pendulum Monsters for Cusillu. It will be Astrograph + Magician of Hope, if you <a href=""https://youtu.be/Wu13yRkZn9A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>watch</strong></a> the video.</li><li><strong>Cross-Sheep:&nbsp;</strong>It's here to deliver Pendulum Monsters from field to Extra Deck, if you use Pendulum Monsters as Link material.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Astrograph Sorcerer"" can be found within ""Counterswing Mages"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"" can be found within ""Those Who Stand Against Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- ""Bujinki Ahashima"" can be found within ""Bujin's Vault of Heaven"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR! However, if you have read the guide, you don't have to craft this card.</p><p>- If you have read the guide, you don't have to craft ""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Well, this deck accomplishes what you want with little beetles called Number 13 and Number 31. After all, they are literal embodiment of ""Crime and Punishment"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti9O6mzOk9c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Let ""Black Garden"" plant five roses to opposing side.</p><p>2) Special Summon Twinkle with Saryuja and give it to opponent with ""Creature Swap""...</p><ul><li>It can be also done with ""Geonator Transverser"" but you need to setup your board accordingly. If you must, remove Ravenous and add Geonator.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 13 and Number 31. If needed, don't hesitate to play ""Tri-Wight"" to pull out 3 x Level 1 dudes from your GY since Saryuja let you free up three Main Monster Zones by Link Summoning Saryuja alone.</p><p>4) Place ""Burning Bamboo Sword"" and then, activate ""Broken Bamboo Sword"" on Twinkle. It's needed to skip your opponent's Main Phase 1 to not let them play anything...</p><ul><li>If interested, same setup can be also done with Amorphactor + Earth Chant but I prefer Bamboo Sword duos because those spells can grant boost for ""Mage Power"".</li></ul><p>5) Equip ""Mage Power"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Psychic Blade"" on Twinkle to boost its ATK by big margin. Then, end your turn.</p><p>6) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate the abilities of Number 13 and Number 31. By detaching one of mats from both beetles, your opponent's monsters will be into Attack Position and all of them will have to attack your beetles, including Twinkle. In addition, when Number 13 and 31 are together, they can't be destroyed by battle or card effects and your opponent will take any battle damage you normally would. Combine it with Twinkle attacking three times in total and you can see the picture clearly now...</p><ul><li>To not miss any timing, change activation confirmation to ""ON"". You can change these settings in-game by choosing ""Switch + Hold"" and manually adjusting required button.</li></ul><p>7) In short, let Twinkle attack into either Number 13 or Number 31 by force three times to self OTK themselves. Thus, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""United We Stand"" + ""Creature Swap"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 30 UR! You don't have to craft ""United We Stand"", if you are low on UR. I hope you were lucky to have these cards beforehand.</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

But you may find that you will end up with for example: Sangan and 1 KOTS in your hand and you'll be stuck with having to send KOTS to search for poly then not be able to make the fusion monster, if you find they're bricking to much then you can just side KOTS and Poly out for something else (Book of Moon and Royal Command).

Don't banish it with Panda by accident as well...</p><ul><li>However, you can banish other Ghostrick cards with Panda, which are Field Spells. Don't let them stuck in GY or you can't fetch them with ""Primal Seed"" later on.</li><li>Also, you can tutor said field spells with Ancient by destroying whatever was present in Field Zone.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon ""Ghostrick Dullahan"" by using 2 x Level 1 monsters. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find banished Ghostrick cards and retrieve Book cards with ""Primal Seed"" to use the ability of Mischief time and time again.</p><p>4) Remember ""Ghostrick Shot"" and ""Ghostrick Renovation"" being in GY?

When Mischief has 10 materials, you win the duel.</li><li>As explained before, retrieve banished Ghostrick cards with ""Primal Seed"" by targeting ""Primal Seed"" first and then any Ghostrick card.</li><li>Mischief's hand-attachment ability isn't hard once per turn. As long as we flip her up and down with Book spells, we can use her hand-attachment ability as much as we can, until she has 10 materials. Don't forget to find Book spells with ""Primal Seed"" as well.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What a lovely finish! I would love to save up some SR and UR points, how about you? If so, keep reading:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Not only does the deck have increased consistency and more in-archetype summons, Kashtira now has a clear win condition, the ""Macro-Cosmos + Drident"" on legs, and destroyer of worlds, metagames and strategies - Ariseheart!</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Ariseheart by himself is a format warping monstrosity since it renders ALL graveyard centred strategies null and void! Not only is he very beefy with a 3000+/3000+ ATK/DEF statline, he can target banish anything on the field as a quick effect, dealing with anything on-field that endangers him! Finally, his XYZ materials will never run out, since he can attach everything from the banish pile (even face-down cards!) everytime something gets banished, which will happen very often in duels with Kashtira.&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Unfortunately, Masterduel's banlist has immediately hit the consistency of pure Kashtira on-release with the limit of Pressured Planet Wraitsoth and the ban of Terraforming not so long ago, so that's three full starters that is not in the deck! Pot of Prosperity has also been limited to 1, which is unfortunate since the card was very free to activate in Kashtira due to not needing their Extra Deck much.

(Covered in the next section below).&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">To increase the deck's consistency, <strong>NON-KASHTIRA</strong> cards are included like 2 Psi-Beast, 2 Planet Pathfinder and 1 Reinforcement of the Army. Of course, 1 Pot of Prosperity is included (would have been 3 if not for the banlist). Triple Tactics Thrust, also a new card from Flames of Fury can also grab from deck Kashtiratheosis which can summon a Kashtira from deck given you have a target on the field.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">10 <strong> KASHTIRA </strong>monsters are present in this deck - even 1 Ogre, 1 KashScareclaw and 1 KashTear so that you have as many names possible to be used with Kashtiratheosis.

This way, you can punish your opponent even more for handtrapping you, especially with Maxx ""C."" Also, going second you have more chances to break boards so that you can actually play the game. Thankfully, TTThrust also can search for Kashtiratheosis, further increasing consistency in the deck.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""margin: 0px; text-align: center;""><strong class=""ContentPasted2 ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">The win condition of this deck is Ariseheart. On top of being a midrange control beatdown deck, this strategy now turbos out its floodgate boss monster to completely shut the opposing player down of plays (Kashtira is basically another flavour of Floowandereeze). That being said, Kashtira is a classic example of a ""Protect the Castle"" strategy -&nbsp; that castle in this case is Ariseheart. Despite it's beefy stats, quick effect banish and floodgate effect, Ariseheart has no inherent protection, making it fragile.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Also, Shangri-Ira's field-lockdown may be annoying for most players, but a full-field lock isn't nearly as possible nowadays with the pre-emptive ban of Diablosis.

Be methodical on how you break boards with this deck - use Main Phase 1 and the Battle Phase in it's full potential. After carefully breaking your opponent's board and baiting out interruption, you can then proceed to full combo into this deck's hero - Ariseheart!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you lose the ""Maxx C minigame,"" this deck can easily pass on simple boards such as Unicorn + Fenrir + Birth. Full comboing to Ariseheart isn't worth giving your opponent 4+ extra cards.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Appointer of the Red Lotus gives back your opponent's card at the next End Phase. If you stuff the card under Ariseheart as XYZ material when it gets banished, you get to keep it permanently and they will not get their card back!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If you use Pot of Prosperity and Ariseheart is already in the field, banish Infinitrack Goliath and the Fossil cards. Ariseheart can attach these cards and gain various benefits! If Goliath is attached, it cannot be destroyed by card effects. if Fossil Wagon or Skull Knight get attached, if Ariseheart leave the field they will go to the GY and become a S/T destruction or monster destruction respectively.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">In this format, it's good to shotgun Maxx ""C"" and Dimension Shifter in the draw phase, since you won't get a chance to chain to a Kashtira's inherent summon. Also, lots of Triple Tactics Talent is running about with Thrust in the card pool.&nbsp;</li><li><em style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted9"">Want to see the deck in action?

The identity of the deck changed from beatstick control to floodgate banish turbo, invalidating most GY-oriented decks forever warping ladder (until a banlist invevitably shafts this deck lol). With Flames of Fury release, Kashtira truly will unleash hell on Masterduel Ladder and on every duelist unfortunate enough to face it. Perhaps we'll experience another Tier 1 format for the next couple months again (oh joy)!&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><p><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Like hyper-consistent decks? Gishki Spright is here for you!,"<p>With a still unbanned Spright Elf running around, Spright is one of the strongest engines right now. Now the question remains, who is poised to abuse this engine the best?</p><p>Why, a bunch of freaky fish guys (and girls), of course!</p><p>Gishki Engine:</p><ul><li>3x Gishki Grimness. This card represents a 1 card combo into Neremanas and Spright Red/Carrot, as it summons any (non-Ritual) Gishki straight from your deck, so always run as many copies as possible. Always summon Abyss off its effect.</li><li>2x Gishki Abyss. Searches out any &lt;1000 DEF Gishki besides Abyss, which is everything but Neremanas in this deck. Not a once per turn, so you can revive it to search multiple times in a single turn.</li><li>2x Gishki Vision. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Monster.</li><li>2x Gishki Shadow. Discard this from your hand to search a Gishki Ritual Spell.</li><li>2x Evigishki Neremanas. It's our boss monster, and absolute menace. Immediately reborns a Gishki on summon to allow you to continue comboing, big body, immune to destruction by battle from ED summoned monsters, and of course the monster negate by bouncing herself back to hand. No hard once per turns either, so you can use all of these multiple times.</li><li>3x Focused Aquamirror. Searches any Gishki monster you want. Typically we grab Grimness, but Neremanas or Shadow can also be worth grabbing if you need one of those more. The end phase effect should be used to set Aquamirror Illusion, as it allows us to double negate with Neremanas during the following turn.</li><li>1x Gishki Aquamirror. The most basic Ritual Spell, the one that... probably won't get used that often. It's great if you have a spare Grimness/Vision/Shadow in hand, as they can be used as the whole requirement for a Ritual, but otherwise it's mostly just our backup plan on turn 3 after we've spent our LP on the other two Ritual Spells.</li><li>1x Gishki Photomirror. Spend 5k LP to summon Neremanas with this bad boy. We only ever use this card once per duel thanks to this, so only one copy is needed.</li><li>1x Gishki Nekromirror. Tributing your opponent's monsters for material is always a good thing to have, as it allows us to out problem cards like Ariseheart.</li><li>1x Aquamirror Illusion. Lets you summon Neremanas straight from your hand for no cost, usually used to resummon Neremanas after you've spent her negate to let her negate again.</li></ul><p>Spright Engine:</p><ul><li>2x Spright Blue. Searches a Spright monster on Special, SS's itself for free if you control a Level/Rank 2.</li><li>1x Spright Jet. Searches our Spright Spell/Traps, all three of them in this deck. Also a free body.</li><li>1x Spright Red. Our other monster negate tool, less important in this deck since we have Neremanas but still extremely useful. Still confused on why the orange one is named Red while the red one is named Carrot.</li><li>1x Spright Carrot. Our primary S/T negate, generally the one I go for when I'm doing the Grimness one card combo.</li><li>2x Spright Starter. Be careful with it, since it can lock you out of Neremanas if you use it before you summon her. Otherwise, lets you do wacky Spright things.</li><li>1x Spright Smashers. I have actually not resolved this once yet in this deck. Still extremely useful, since a non-targeting banish is something you'll really benefit from in this format.</li><li>2x Gigantic Spright. Bit less important in this brew than other Spright builds, still extremely strong. You cannot use this to start a Gishki combo, as it locks you into 2s for the rest of the turn (meaning no Neremanas without hard drawing Aquamirror Illusion to summon her next turn).</li><li>2x Spright Elf. Enables us to one card combo into Neremanas from Grimness, then protects Neremanas and lets you generate a lot of advantage over the turns with its revival effect.</li><li>1x Spright Sprind. Honestly I don't actually use this card that often, but we have a lot of space in the ED and it can occasionally help.</li></ul><p>Non-engine is just various assorted good stuff, replace as you see fit to combat the meta. Kaijus or Kurikara Divincarnate would be really good this format, but the exact specifics I leave to you to decide.</p><p>Rest of the ED (everything but I:P can be replaced to suit preferences and the meta at hand):</p><ul><li>1x Downerd+ZEUS. Backup plan, you should very rarely ever need to be summoning them but they're handy to have.</li><li>1x Accesscode Talker. OTK push go brr.</li><li>1x I:P Masquerena. Generally a frequent staple of my high roll end boards, one of the best ED cards here since you can go into a lot of options.</li><li>1x Knightmare Unicorn. I:P target, summon when you need a card off the field.</li><li>1x Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. I:P target, summon when you need something that's a borderline Towers or fight through anything and everything while protecting you from battle damage.</li><li>1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World. I:P target and general out to enemy Towers-type monsters (or anything too scary that we just need gone without using traditional removal.</li><li>1x Onibimaru Soul Sweeper. Another board breaking tool, haven't summoned this yet myself.</li><li>1x Topologic Zeroboros. Bit of a... unorthodox pick. OTK tool, boardbreaker, I:P target in certain situations. Haven't summoned this yet, but I wanted to use this for something and figured this would be a solid place for it.</li><li>1x Salamangreat Almiraj. Honestly I'm probably cutting this going forward. The situations where I'd use it are extremely narrow and I'd rather have a toolbox to out problem boards. Still usable, especially if you run more revive tools than I do (since you can NS Abyss, search, send it by linking it for Almiraj, then resummon it with your revive to search again, guaranteeing access to Neremanas).</li></ul><p>We have a lot of combos to go into various big boards. The most relevant one, though is our Grimness one card combo and the one I'll touch upon. Steps go as so:</p><ol><li>(optional) Use Focused Aquamirror to search Grimness.</li><li>NS Grimness, SS Abyss. Use Abyss effect to search out Vision/Shadow.</li><li>Link both Grimness and Abyss for Spright Elf.</li><li>Spright Elf effect revive Abyss.</li><li>Abyss effect search out Vision/Shadow (whichever one you didn't grab with the first search).</li><li>Use Vision and Shadow to search Neremanas and a Ritual Spell (if you do not have a spare Vision/Shadow/Grimness in hand, search Photomirror, otherwise grab Aquamirror)</li><li>Use your Ritual Spell to summon Neremanas, revive Grimness or Vision.</li><li>Overlay Abyss+Grimness/Vision for Gigantic Spright.</li><li>Use Gigantic to SS Blue from Deck.</li><li>Blue search Jet.</li><li>SS Jet, grab Starter.</li><li>Use Starter, SS Carrot/Red. I usually summon Carrot, as we already have a monster negate on board.</li><li>(optional but highly recommended) Link off Blue/Jet/Gigantic for I:P Masquerena.</li><li>(if you used Focused Aquamirror) During End Phase, set Aquamirror Illusion.</li></ol><p>This nets you a monster negate (two if you set Aquamirror Illusion), a spell negate, and I:P Masquerena. That's off one card. Obviously handtraps can make your day miserable (we cannot play through Droll or Dimensional Shifter, and you need a relatively lucky hand to make Neremanas under Maxx C without giving your opponent way too many cards), but we can play through Imperm and Ash with little trouble on lucky hands. And if you don't draw into the Gishki stuff, you can still make a pretty solid Spright endboard in some situations, or just use your non-engine to stall for a bit until you can kill.</p>"

As long as you attach at least 10 materials to Digital Bug Corebage, you can make it to the top with C9 for fatal explosion.)</p><p>Hey! These insects are bugging me. Let's flip them up and down, shall we?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/jH5FkSa.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>First of all, although not seen in this picture, Special Summon ""Digital Bug Websolder"" with Saryuja. Then, activate Websolder's ability to change battle position of a monster you have -from Attack to Defense- to bring forth second Websolder from your hand. Then, XYZ Summon Scaradiator by using 2 x Websolder as materials.</li><li>Then, use Saryuja and any monster but Chaos/Scaradiator/Panda to Link Summon Reprodocus and line Scaradiator behind it.</li><li>Don't forget to place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. It's needed to find Books and Rank-Up spells with ""Primal Seed"" duo, that's why.</li><li>Also, play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; Rebirth Judgment"" combo to change the type of every monster in GYs to ""Insect"".</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) As seen above, ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" was played. It was to bring forth ""Digital Bug Corebage"", our main worker for this deck:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/cbEKohd.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/YpckOFP.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/MaHjOsh.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see from these three pictures, in order to attach a material to Corebage, battle position of monster(s) has to be changed. By turning Panda face-down, we can gladly do so. Oh, we have to pick a monster which has to be ""Insect"" but we already got it covered with ""Rebirth Judgment"" trick.</li><li>The ability of Corebage isn't hard once per turn. So, as long as we reset Corebage by flipping up and down, we can change battle position of Panda to attach another monster as many times as time limit allows. Try to aim for at least 10 materials...<br /><ul><li>Fortunately for you, ""Primal Seed"" duo can find Book spells in addition to Astral Force because your job isn't over yet.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) When you have attached at least 10 materials to Corebage, activate Astral Force to bring forth Rhinosebus. Then, change its type to ""Machine"", which allows you to bridge into Number 9 with Astral Force for last time. Finally, seal the game by activating Barian's Force to bring forth Number C9:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/edwB243.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/y1vtKpU.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/IEYspfg.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/YQsUIGn.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/SoggCin.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/gve2PQv.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/4Gd7U1R.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/h9fO2lz.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>For context, total damage inflicted was 300 x 13 + 800 x 13 = 14300 damage, which results into FTK with a bit overkill.</li><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/yOJH9K37sw0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Digital Bug Scaradiator"" and ""Digital Bug Rhinosebus"" can be collected for free, if you have acquired ""Growing Digital Bug"" structure pack from PvE mode in ""Digital Bugs in Cyberspace"" chapter to save 30 SR and 30 UR!

Panda+Arcana+Starving Venoms,"<p>Greetings! I have brought you a puzzle-worthy deck, where you will be bamboozled. It's about bypassing the text of ""Independent Nightingale"", which mentions ""unaffected by other cards' effects"", meaning that you can't negate Independent so easily. What if I told you there is a workaround? If <a href=""/deck/342724"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Supreme</strong></a>&nbsp;is going to be banned in Master Duel one day, which is already the case in TCG but not in OCG for some reason, this deck will achieve exactly the same play-style but with some extras as Starving Venoms. Let's jump in!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the situation as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/ctPgMpG.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>For context, Arcana was Special Summoned with Saryuja. When ""Light Barrier"" is present, you can change the outcome of Arcana to&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to always skip your opponent's turn at the cost of delivering two monsters you control to GY. These will be Panda and Spirit.<ul><li>To not miss out anything, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li></ul></li><li>You don't have to bring forth Assembled and Venemy on first turn but I did it anyways. Note that you have to place Assembled onto Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) and Venemy on Main Monster Zone (MMZ). You will see why later on.<ul><li>To place Assembled on EMZ, you have to destroy Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"".</li></ul></li><li>Don't forget to place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find key cards with ""Primal Seed"". As long as you target ""Primal Seed"" each other alongside combo pieces, everything will be fine.</li><li>Also, set ""Fiendish Chain"" and ""Primal Seed"". Since ""Into the Void"" was played beforehand, every spell will be banished instead of being delivered to GY thanks to ME-PSY-YA. Thus, it's vital to have ""Primal Seed"" with you.</li><li>Although not seen in this picture, either discard Beatraptor + Risebell with Ravenous or have them in your hand to be delivered to GY via ""Into the Void"" later on.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Thanks to Arcana, it's your turn now. There is still much to do:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/I1plzGC.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>In this picture, you can see every combo pieces you are going to use. ""Fusion Tag"" will be the most important one.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) First, we can start bringing forth Independent Nightingale:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/72qKgZD.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/dwwtR9l.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/j5O74wE.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/FR7lw5c.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/xCtiJXF.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/19H60t3.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>In these pictures, you can see ""Fusion Tag"" being used on Flamvell to change its name into ""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"". Mind you, in order to Fusion Summon ""Independent Nightingale"", you need ""Assembled Nightingale"" and one any Lyrilusc monster. Since ""Independent Nightingale"" is a Lyrilusc monster, you can cheat out Independent with Assembled + Flamvell, all thanks to editing name of a monster you control with ""Fusion Tag"". Crazy, ain't it?</li><li>Remember the situation about Independent, which was about ""unaffected by other cards' effects""? By placing Independent on EMZ while Beatraptor is around, you can completely negate her, as long as Independent is present only on EMZ. To make her completely negated wherever she will be, activating ""Fiendish Chain"" and targeting on Independent will be enough. She can't be a free bird anymore and will be imprisoned by Starving Venom brothers, coming soon 😂</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) Then, time to bring forth other Starving Venom brothers, namely ""Starving Venom"" and ""Odd-Eyes Venom"":</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/fluMhTT.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Since all Starving Venom brothers can only target your opponent's monsters on the battlefield, you have to give your opponent Independent with ""Shien's Spy"" first.</li><li>Then, Fusion Summon ""Odd-Eyes Venom"" on EMZ. As explained in #3, you can change names of monsters you control with ""Fusion Tag"". Target one with ""Starving Venom"" and other one with ""Odd-Eyes Venom"". Since those monsters have ""Starving Venom"" and ""Odd-Eyes"" in their names, you can cheat out ""Odd-Eyes Venom"".</li><li>Finally, Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom"" by having two DARK monsters on the field. Simply revive either 2 x Exodia pieces or 2 x Monks with ""Monster Reborn"" and use them as Fusion Materials. There is no need for ""Fusion Tag"" for this one...<ul><li>In order to let ""Starving Venom"" copycat Independent like his other brothers, you have to raise the level of Independent to 5 or above. Fortunately, Risebell can raise her level and it's not hard once per turn. Thus, revive and destroy Risebell with ""Monster Reborn"" and Offerings to do what you have to do.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5) Copycat Independent with Starving Venom brothers. Afterwards, pull the trigger with everyone to shoot your opponent down for fatality:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/RZA887n.png"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/N1OYOim.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/7ISkBq_mHU4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6) In case your opponent is still alive and you need to take extra turns with Arcana, here is the order without breaking your setup:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/g9Ygi1y.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/0BE3RuQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/MAhzG9o.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/BumI8t8.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>These pictures describe a ""what if"" scenario, not what was actually transpired on Ranked. Done on PvE mode but still holds water for Ranked as well.</li><li>To sum up, you need to use the ability of Arcana to send ""Starving Venom"" and Exodia piece first. Then, return Independent to your home.</li><li>Then, like before, give Independent to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"" and raise its level with Risebell. Afterwards, revive ""Starving Venom"" with ""Monster Reborn"" and play as usual.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial before to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Beatraptor"" can be found within ""Prehistoric Beast Advance"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Assembled Nightingale"" + ""Independent Nightingale"" can be found within ""Moonlit Avian Dance"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" can be found within ""Natural Selection"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon"" can be found within ""Draconic Resplendence"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Swordmaster is able to lend others his abilities because of this. Spiritmaster shares the importance of the grace God has given them by the purification of God&rsquo;s fire. Spectral sword is the spirit of their leader who is able to assist others via the waters of the Holy Spirit. Blacksmith reflects the importance of God in their lives due to how their weapons are made. Shade is supposed to be the old sins of the group that have been tried in the fire but Squire has to learn how to use it to not sin and is technically no longer needed. And Squire doesn&rsquo;t really want to battle because of Shade until she realizes the importance of her role. Solitaire isn&rsquo;t really needed either but he tries to remind the Shiranui of the importance of the other Shiranui sharing what God has done for them with the message to not rely on satan and to submit to the will of God.<br /><br />Their spells/traps are expressions of what God has done in their lives. Ghost meets girl is a testament of the hospitality of the Shiranui when your opponent has a monster. Samsara is the promise of God that we will be born again in water and made pure in His fire. Style Success is the importance of how God forgives us of our sins because of Jesus baptizing us in the spirit since we will be reborn in water and have our sins removed by God&rsquo;s righteous fire. Style Synthesis is the blessing from God that God has imbued onto Shiranui&rsquo;s leader to pass onto the other members of the Shiranui: the importance of telling others of God&rsquo;s promises and living faithfully according to this.</p>"

That said, my current step is testing considerations for the second Superdora over the Gustav (it's good for an easy OTK, but OTKs come pretty easily to this deck anyway) or the Gadget (un-bricks some bad hands, but we're trying to reduce the chances of those bad hands anyway).</p>"

Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>It's no joke that Kashtiras are crazy. After attaching lots of materials with <a href=""/deck/371025"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Arise-Heart</strong></a>, I decided to commit another crime with Kashtiras. This time, it will be with Shangri-Ira. Combined with ""Gift Exchange"" which banishes cards face-down, in addition to other block cards, your opponent won't be able to do anything. Time to bring chaos!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/2d3XLvk.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Make sure you have lots of Main Monster Zone (MMZ) free. Link Summoning Saryuja and using Ravenous will help in that regard.</li><li>Although I went first in this game, if you go second, play ""Raigeki"" to free up MMZ of your opponent's and ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" to clear all spells/traps your opponent controls.</li><li>Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find your banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo.</li><li>Set cards were as follows:<ul><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies activation of Field Spells.</li><li><strong>Primal Seed:&nbsp;</strong>We will find banished cards.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Gift Exchange:&nbsp;</strong>Your zone blocker card for Shangri-Ira.</li></ul></li><li>The reason as to why we set those cards is that ""Lavalval Salamander"" will be Synchro Summoned. After that, Lavalval will draw 2 cards. Since we don't have any FIRE monster in the hand, Lavalval will shuffle every card from hand to deck, which equates into resources for ""Gift Exchange"" and naturally, Shangri-Ira. Thus, it's wiser to keep whatever we can.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Synchro Summon ""Lavalval Salamander"" by using Cthugua + Martial as materials. Then, XYZ Summon ""Kashtira Shangri-Ira"" by using Lavalval + Ancient as materials:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/v2Y7SjQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see, 19 cards will be returned from hand to deck. You need at least 10 cards for ""Gift Exchange"" and Shangri-Ira, which is more than enough.</li></ul><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/FCmGGoO.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>While banishing cards within your deck as face-down, target combo pieces first. For example, Angel O7, which denies the activation of Effect Monsters but only if you Tribute Summon Angel O7. Otherwise, it won't work and Tribute Summon after your job is done with ""Gift Exchange"" and Shangri-Ira...<ul><li>Fortunately for you, ""Primal Seed"" doesn't discriminate whether you have banished your cards as face-up or face-down. As long as it is banished, you can retrieve it.</li><li>Theoretically, you can retrieve said cards with ""Primal Seed"" to not give your opponent any because they will be either sent to GY or delivered to Banish Zone (BZ) as face-up, if you activate ""Into the Void"" at End Phase. Yet, time is ticking, so don't try to waste any more time than you should.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) After banishing every single zone your opponent has with ""Shangri-Ira"" and ""Gift Exchange"" duo, reach the board state as shown and end your turn:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/uyBKnUn.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>""Primal Seed"" and ""Mask of Restrict"" were set. Remainder doesn't matter, you don't have to set every card.</li><li>Just to recap, here is what you have as ""blockers"" against your opponent...<ul><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira:</strong> Denies zones your opponent has.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>ME-PSY-YA:&nbsp;</strong>Spells and traps will be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of spells/traps that can activate from BZ.</li></ul></li><li>Also, to not miss out anything, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) On your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/OD3YGh7.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/Ks9tjpB.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/FbSvyKuwVO8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" + ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" can be found within ""Glory on Wings"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Hope you were lucky to find at least one copy to save 30 SR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

It's needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" duo.</p><p>2) When your Main Deck has no cards, Fusion Summon ""The Dark Magicians"" by using ""King of the Swamp"" and a Spellcaster (Exodia/Monk) monster as materials.</p><p>3) Fill your board with monsters thanks to ""Monster Reborn"". Then, shuffle ""DNA Transplant"" with ""The Humble Sentry"". This setup was needed to draw your only card, which is a Trap card to activate at will, thanks to ""The Dark Magicians"". Activate it when your side of board is full to change the attributes of all monsters to LIGHT.</p><p>4) Destroy ""The Dark Magicians"" with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive with ""Monster Reborn"". This is needed to reset ""The Dark Magicians"", so that we can do what was explained in #3 but for ""Solar Ray"" to continuously deal 3600 damage in total.</p><p>5) Rinse and repeat what was explained in #4 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

Yet, did you know that you can also convert incoming damage to healing with Oracle King, where you can reflect it to your opponent as damage with Number 43? I bet you didn't, which is why I would like to show you a setup I made with ""Skull Invitation"". Let's jump in!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSFulPtfn5c"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, either send ""Infernity Sage"" to GY with Dugares or Special Summon it with Saryuja.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. Just don't banish any one of three Level 2 DARK monsters by accident with Chaos Emperor Dragon, which are needed for XYZ Summon of 2 x Number 43 monsters...</p><ul><li>ME-PSY-YA and Chaos are perfect duo for retrieving banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo. As long as you target each other, you can make larger and larger hand.</li></ul><p>3) Destroy Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and Fusion Summon Oracle King to where Saryuja was, which is Extra Monster Zone (EMZ). To do so, activate Swirl when you also have Ghost in-hand because you need to use both monsters as Fusion materials for Oracle King.</p><p>4) Revive Ghost + Swirl + Sage with ""Monster Reborn"" and XYZ Summon Number 43. Then, destroy it with Offerings and revive the trio for another time for second Number 43, which will be also destroyed.</p><p>5) Revive both Number 43 monsters and Sage. Then, by using ""Primal Seed"" duo, have at least 25-30 cards in your hand.</p><p>6) Play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; Skull Invitation"" combo. Don't trigger Number 43 when asked to due to ""Skull Invitation"" until you activate Sage.</p><p>7) Destroy ME-PSY-YA with ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" and activate Sage. What is going to happen is that Sage will discard your whole hand and you would normally take big chunk of damage with ""Skull Invitation"". However, thanks to Oracle King, you will convert incoming damage to healing. Then, you can pull the trigger with both Number 43 monsters to convert healing into damage against your opponent to win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""D/D Swirl Slime"" can be found within ""Cross-Dimensional Contracts"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found within ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

(2022 Copium Build?),"<p>A surprisingly consistent and fun going first build. Would recommend giving it a test run on YGO Omega before committing. The deck aims to use various engines and special summoning to play through disruption. Maxx C should arguably be used in the deck, however the P.U.N.K. field spell is usually a +2 to +3 into the engines so it doesn't seem as necessary with the P.U.N.K. package, as well as Maxx C is shut down once Arise-Heart is on the field. The Adventure engine alongside Kashtira allows for Nibiru safe combos. Simply special summon Unicorn, then activate Rite of Aramesir or Water Enchantress to search for Aramesir, and run the Adventure combo. The ideal hand is something similar to Rite of Aramesir, Emergency Teleport, and Kashtira Unicorn. This hand is safe from Nibiru, as well as can survive Unicorn being Imperm'd due to P.U.N.K. backup plays being available with Emergency Teleport. The Zombie Vampire can be used in the P.U.N.K. combo to mill for special summoning of Kashtira Unicorn or Firewall Guardian for DPE Scythe Lock or Kashtira plays. DPE cannot be summoned in conjunction with the full Kashtira combo line, due to RiseHeart Xyz lock, however DPE can be used freely in the P.U.N.K. lines after all P.U.N.K. combos have been completed. DPE can be summoned with Kashtira Arise-Heart on the field only with Fusion Destiny hard drawed. Verte card effect states the Fusion spell must be sent to the GY, of which Arise-Heart will not allow, nullifying Verte's secondary effect while Arise-Heart is on the field. The DPE Scythe lock combo can be ran alongside the Adventure engine, as Firewall Guardian activates in the GY when linked off, and not on the field. Attached video link to Dkayed's video explaining the 1 card DPE Scythe lock combo, which explains the link monsters in the extra deck and Firewall Guardian in the main deck. Please remember to keep your link zones open however for the DPE Scythe lock combo. Feel free to modify this deck as it is experimental, and arguably oversaturated with engines, however this is my fun deck. Enjoy, and remember to always have fun.&nbsp;</p>"

To the aim that is this, you basically just play a regular Chaos deck, only with a bunch of stall cards to achieve that aim. The point, naturally, is that the opponent shouldn't know what you are doing until it's too late; this is why the deck is specifically geared to look like a ordinary Chaos deck, it's to essentially make them think otherwise on this plan and play normally. We only need two cards to get the deck aim; Wall to reduce our life points enough to activate Self-Destruct.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to deal with the inevitable potential negation, multiple measures are made. Trunade at three lets us just force out any potential interactions without even needing to negate anything, and if they don't waste resources on it, great! That just makes the job much easier. Fake Trap is also a very weird but very effective option, allowing us to midigate big backrow destruction and buy time, as does the presence of triple Solemn. Other than that, the deck more or less functions in a conventional fashion. You could honestly win games without even needing the stall stipulation.</p><p>Side-deck is also quite important; you can side out the stall antics to go into a regular Chaos deck...in which case it functions as a smokescreen to a opponent who's probably focused on siding out backrow counters like Royal Degree or more Dust Tornados. Of course the deck is also perfectly fine throwing in some potential Burn if that's needed as well, using the meta of 3x Wave-Motion and Koala to confuse things further. I did once use this to draw games like what, 7 times in a row? I guess you can do that as well lol</p><p>Point is, just goof off with the deck. Smartly, mind you, but always try to mix what the deck is doing here and there, it's more useful than you think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Try to get at least 10 materials attached to Plump or it might not be enough to win with C9 later on.)</p><p>Greetings! It's time unleash Catzilla and have a blast with C9 later on. If interested, keep reading!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/tZzIkgx.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>""Banisher of the Light"" was Special Summoned by Saryuja. Also, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon and have Ravenous with you. At one point, you will destroy Banisher, that's why...<ul><li>Actually, you don't have to use Banisher. Instead, if you have, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone. Since ME-PSY-YA costs UR to craft and I don't have two of those, I had to use Banisher as a substitute.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Then, Link Summon Reprodocus by using Panda + Saryuja as materials:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/WFy45OQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/J8MS21b.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>As you can see from these two pictures, you have to XYZ Summon Plump by using Nemeses + Formula as materials. Also, place him right behind Reprodocus, you will see why later on.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Since every card will be sent to Banish Zone (BZ) instead of GY, you can retrieve banished cards with ""Primal Seed"" duo. Fetch as many spells as you can, minimum 10 excluding combo pieces, with ""Primal Seed"" duo and then, destroy ""Banisher"" with Ravenous...</p><ul><li>Or, ME-PSY-YA, but only if you have two of them and placed one of them to Pendulum Zone beforehand.</li></ul><p>4) Then, play ""Spell Reproduction"" to discard two of your spells to GY and target ""Spell Reproduction"" to have it with you. This setup actually causes a loop. When you have discarded at least 10 spells except combo pieces, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone.&nbsp;</p><p>5) With ME-PSY-YA present, it's time to switch to ""Primal Seed"" setup. First, attach spells from GY to Plump. Then, use Book spells to reset its ability to do it again and retrieve Books with ""Primal Seed"" duo. After you have attached at least 10 spells, overlay into Happiness but don't forget to place behind Reprodocus:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/lXtyDaO.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/50t7oH0.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6) Then, change the type of Happiness to ""Machine"" with Reprodocus. Now, you can lead the way to C9. Play ""Astral Force"" for Number 9 and ""Barian's Force"" for C9.

Also, don't forget to activate the ability of ""Abyss Dweller"" to block the activation of anything within your opponent's GY. It's crucial to be not disturbed.</p><p>2) Special Summon Bone Tower with Saryuja, right behind its Extra Monster Zone. Then, Normal Summon Meiru. Afterwards, Link Summon Reprodocus, right above Bone Tower.</p><p>3) Activate Reprodocus and change the attribute of Bone Tower to anything other than LIGHT and DARK. Reason is that we don't want Bone Tower being negated by Meiru.</p><p>4) Activate ""Zombie World"" alongside ""Dark Room of Nightmare"" + ""Paralyzing Chain"". Then, Special Summon Turbo Booster. Since everything on the field and in the GYs become Zombie, you can mill your opponent with any kind of Special Summon, in addition to burning your opponent to death with Nightmare and Chain.</p><p>5) What makes it endless is returning Booster to your hand with Birdman. Although Meiru negates the effects of LIGHT and DARK monsters, it doesn't negate their costs. So, Birdman can return Booster to your hand (cost) and Birdman can stay in your hand instead of Special Summoning to the field (effect) thanks to negate of Meiru, since Birdman is a DARK monster...</p><ul><li>Simply put, Birdman and Booster can use their effects forever.

Then, replace one of Exodia pieces with Incarnate.</p><p>3) Target ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Incarnate to adjust the level of your monsters to 10. Then, excluding Chaos, XYZ Summon 2 x Number 35 by using 4 monsters as materials.</p><p>4) Either Special Summon Lantron with Saryuja or via ""Monster Reborn"", if you have sent Lantron to GY with Dugares/Ravenous.</p><p>5) Give your opponent 2 x Number 35 monsters with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>6) Revive any monster with ""Monster Reborn"". What is going to happen is that 2 x Number 35 monsters will deal 2 x 600 = 1200 damage in total because you have Special Summoned a monster.

Laevatein is your main go-to rank 9, however, some situations may call for Infinitrack Earth Slicer or Enterblathnir.

Try to get at least 10 materials attached to Number 38 or it might not be enough to win with C9 later on.)</p><p>Greetings! Time to bring Harbinger of Galaxies, Number 38. Number 38 is ready to launch a nuclear satellite called Number C9. Just be careful out there!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Er-QaKPwcY"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA and Xiangsheng on Pendulum Zones. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon...</p><ul><li>ME-PSY-YA and Chaos Emperor are needed for ""Primal Seed"" interactions, where we will find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ).</li><li>Xiangsheng is here for adjusting Rank of Number 38 from 8 to 7, so that we can lead the way with Number 9 later on.</li></ul><p>2) When Chaos Emperor is here, revive 2 x Level monsters with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, target Chaos Emperor with ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" to set these two to 8.</p><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 38 by using them as materials. Don't use anything else, including Chaos Emperor.</p><p>4) To attach materials into Number 38, you need to negate your spells. If you have changed ""Activation Confirmation"" within ""Duel"" from settings into ""Switch + Hold"", you can hold down the left mouse button after you have played a spell. Changing from ""OFF"" to ""ON"", game will ask you if you want to negate the spell, so that you can attach it to Number 38. Just don't negate combo pieces and attach them by accident, then you will be fine.</p><p>5) To repeat what was explained in #4, you need to flip up and down Number 38 with Book spells because the attachment ability of Number 38 isn't hard once per turn. While doing so, don't forget to find Book spells with ""Primal Seed"" setup explained in #1.</p><p>6) When you have attached enough materials to Number 38, which should be at least 10, revive Ancient with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, activate Xiangsheng and target Number 38 alongside Ancient to change the Rank of Number 38 from 8 to 7. Next is activating ""Clockwork Night"" to change the Type of Number 38 into ""Machine"".</p><p>7) With Rank and Type modifications done, you can activate ""Astral Force"" to overlay into Number 9. Then, you can lead the way with ""Barian's Force"" to Number C9.</p><p>8) Activate both abilities of C9 to deal huge damage and win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" + ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 38"" can be found within ""Nebula Cyclone"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Last time, I did FTK with Number 38 alongside <a href=""/deck/harbinger-of-spheres-373762"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Number C9.</strong></a> This time, it will be with Number 43. Let me explain in brief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrG6R-RyqVs"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>2) Special Summon Sharnga &gt;&gt;&gt; Vata &gt;&gt;&gt; Caligo, in explained order. Clear some of Main Monster Zones (MMZ) and Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" for space. Then, XYZ Summon Number 43 with these three and place it on EMZ...</p><ul><li>If you want to have a look at other Level 2 DARK monsters as alternatives, feel free to check them in ""Side Deck"". You don't have to exclusively use these three, I just picked them for convenience. For example, you can use Spright trio called Pixies/Jet/Blue.</li><li>Alternatively, use ""Lair of Darkness"" and pick any three Level 2 monsters which are easy to Special Summon. No matter what attribute they are, these will be changed to DARK.</li></ul><p>3) Fill your MMZ with Level monsters via ""Monster Reborn"". Then, target Chaos Emperor with ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" to set the level of your monsters to 8.</p><p>4) XYZ Summon Number 38 and Number 97 by using all monsters but Chaos Emperor as materials, two for each.</p><p>5) Destroy Number 97 with Offerings. Then, activate the ability of Number 38 to gain its ATK by targeting on Number 38.</p><p>6) Repeat the step explained in #5 until the ATK of Number 38 is higher than your opponent's LP. Finally, activate ""Mystik Wok"" and target on Number 38. Don't forget to choose its ATK.</p><p>7) With ""Mystik Wok"" granting the ATK of Number 38 as LP, Number 43 is ready to inflict same amount of LP gained as damage to your opponent. Just do it and win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Sharnga"" + ""Vata"" can be collected by purchasing ""Blackwing's Pride"" deck. 60 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 38"" can be found within ""Nebula Cyclone"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 480 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

I think it's a card that hasn't been cracked yet, be it because of the underwhelming power of Reptiles in Edison or because it's a very janky card in of itself that does need work to see effective results. Feel like this build is a bit more flexiable than just committing fully to one specific strat, which is why there's a bit of a mix in the side in terms of what exactly the deck wants to do and not do, so you got a bit of Alien, you run the regular Reptilianne engine to skim the deck, etc etc. Ananta regardless is a key monster for purely building up pressure and being consistent reliable field removal.</p><p>You think playing 3x Ananta would brick starting hands; I thought so as well; but for the vast majority of test showings I've had no such issue at all. It's a bit of a issue at points when you draw one out of the blue if you're not correctly set up, otherwise they seem pretty well balanced with the rest of the deck.&nbsp;</p>"

It's So RAW!!!,"<p>After playing this deck in a simulator for two months and finally getting the chance to play it in an actual paper format with the Age of Overlord Premiere! event, I'm finally feeling confident enough to say this: the support pushes this deck to being much better than either I or anyone else has been giving it credit for. I'm going to try to give these cards a legitimate write-up, in the hopes that I can get players to give it a try.</p><hr /><p>I'll start with an explanation on the ratios of the Nouvelles and their adjacent support in the deck, to help you understand why you're running it like this.</p><ul><li><em>Foie Glasya</em> and <em>Confiras</em> are both at 1 since neither of them actually do anything to start your combos and are purely extenders - Foie Glasya is a valid target for Poeltis's summon if you don't need a second Balameuniere while simultaneously acting as GY interruption if brought out during your opponent's plays, while Confiras is mainly there if all of your Poeltis are tied up, or you specifically need a backrow pop or to force your opponent's cards into attack. Even if that's not really much, Confiras and Meat Recipe can be simultaneously added with Pre-Preparation of Rites, since Meat Recipe specifically lists Confiras in its effect, so it can be grabbed in an emergency.</li><li><em>Every other Nouvelles Ritual Monster</em>&nbsp;is at 2 - Nouvelles has some pretty solid search power, so running less than 3 of each Ritual Monster works, in addition to reducing the brickiness that Ritual Decks often have.</li><li><em>Poissoniere</em> at 3, as well as <em>Culinary Confrontatio</em>n - you almost always want to see these, as Poissoniere searches either Buerillabaise or a Recipe, and Culinary Confrontation is an E-Tele for Poissoniere.</li><li><em>Fish Recipe</em> is at 3, while <em>Meat Recipe</em> is at 1 - Fish Recipe is just better to start your Ritual Plays, since it's searchable with Pre-Prep and itself can search Meat Recipe.</li><li><em>Today's Menu</em> at 3 - it's a free search. Even if it does give your opponent some agency in what you add, you're still going to go +1 by using it (or Neutral if your opponent gives you Poissoniere - which, as mentioned before, is still good).</li><li><em>Nouvelles Restaurant</em> can be run at 1, but I prefer it at 2. It'll be on your first turn endboard quite often whether or not you draw it, but having a second copy does create a small resource loop that can constantly shuffle the first back into your deck to repeatedly grab Chef's Special Recipe after it's been spent.</li><li><em>Chef's Special Recipe</em> is run at 1 - you don't want to start with it, but like Restaurant, you can often end with it. It's also able to be grabbed from the GY by activating another Restaurant as part of that resource loop, meaning you never really need a second.</li><li><em>Hungry Burger</em> is at 1 - it purely exists to be a valid target for Baelgrill's Quick Effect. It's the brickiest brick in your deck, but is still required for that one last removal.</li></ul><p>As for the non-engine cards, it should be fairly obvious why you run those ratios.&nbsp;<em>Pre-Preparation of Rites</em> and&nbsp;<em>Diviner of the Herald</em> are at 3 because they search engine pieces, start combos, or do both. The&nbsp;<em>Impcantations</em> are run at 2 of each, which creates a balance of both being able to see them consistently while also not crowding your deck with them. And&nbsp;<em>Ash Blossom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Imperm</em> are both at 3 because hand trap great.</p><p>The Extra Deck is a combination of Ritual Fodder and Game-Closers, with a couple of things in-between.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><em>Patissciel Couverture</em> is run because it turns Culinary Confrontation online - you're giving it to your opponent to serve as fodder for your plays.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Herald of the Arc Light&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elder Entity N'Tss</em> are both pitch fodder for Diviner of the Herald; Arc Light helps you set up by searching for a Ritual piece, while N'Tss can remove a piece of the opponent's board in a pinch.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</em> is your primary game-closer - if you're doing the math and need just a bit more damage to clear an opponent's board, you can sack three of your lower-power Ritual Monsters to bring out a 4800 ATK, indestructible, untargetable beater to finish things off.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Dyna Mondo&nbsp;</em>is a panic option if you're running out of plays and need to get rid of something. It also lets you bring back a Nouvelles from the Graveyard on your opponent's turn, which does let you do some interesting plays while getting a Nouvelles floodgate back on the field.</li><li><em>Relinquished Anima</em> can be summoned with Poissoniere or Buerillabaise and just punishes an opponent for careless zone placement - non-destruction removal is always nice, even if this deck already has no shortage of it.</li><li><em>Knightmare Unicorn</em> has its bounce, but is mostly there for a Link Climb into&nbsp;<em>Accesscode Talker</em>, for if you still need something a bit more powerful than even Nephthys can provide.</li><li><em>Chaos Angel&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Baronne de Fleur</em> are generic Synchro bosses that won't come out often, but are able to be brought out with a small amount of set-up. Your Nouvelles can mostly do the job, but if you need a little push in power, they are an option.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis</em> is a floodgate on legs that can block anything above 3000 ATK - which all of your main deck monsters slip under easily. If your opponent brings out some high-level Extra Deck monsters, you can get something out, go into this, and block them for a turn.</li></ul><p>Finally, the Side Deck is packed with your generic counterpick tools.</p><ul><li><em>Nibiru</em> is run for the blow-out against summon-heavy decks. I prefer running it over <em>Evenly Matched</em> since it gives your opponent a Token that you can use for your own Nouvelles plays.</li><li><em>Dark Ruler No More</em> helps you overcome stacked negate boards, which is very useful going second, especially since you need plenty of effects to get this deck going.</li><li><em>Kaijus</em> help get rid of your opponent's immune bosses, like Expurrely Noir. You could alternatively run&nbsp;<em>Herald of the Abyss</em>, but I prefer the Kaiju to, once again, get a useless body on your opponent's field for your own plays.</li><li><em>Lightning Storm</em> and&nbsp;<em>Harpie's Feather Duster</em> just help clear out the backrow - removing potential floodgates really helps to keep this deck online.</li><li><em>Gozen Match's</em> uses are two-fold. Its basic play is just a good floodgate that stops some decks like Floo and Kashtira, while your mostly-DARK Monsters can play under it. However, you can perform a lock if you draw it along with Culinary Confrontation, which puts a monster on your opponent's board - if your opponent doesn't run DARK monsters or backrow removal, they're out of luck.</li></ul><hr /><p>The most common pieces on an end-board you'll be going for are a Balameuniere summoned with a Nouvelles effect and a set Chef's Special Recipe. Anything else you can get on the field is gravy, especially if you can summon Poeltis or Foie Glasya on your turn 1 and keep it on your field, but these cards by themselves are capable of forcing your opponent to second-guess quite a lot of their plays, especially when their Normal Summon is involved.</p><p>I'll start with a basic combo line. Your hand will start with&nbsp;<strong>Poissoniere de Nouvelles, Poeltis</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Foie Glasya de Nouvelles</strong> (either works),&nbsp;<strong>Fish Recipe</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Buerillabaise de Nouvelles</strong> (either works), and&nbsp;<strong>one Monster of level 3 or higher</strong>. This seems a bit complex and specific at first, but this deck is running plenty of search power and generic cards that can turn into these cards (<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> gets you both Fish Recipe and Buerillabaise,&nbsp;<strong>Today's Menu</strong> can snag either Foie Glasya or Poeltis, etc.) - with a bit of experience, you'll be able to grab what you need or extend even further.</p><ol><li>Normal Summon&nbsp;<strong>Poissoniere de Nouvelles</strong><ul><li>On Summon: Activate Poissoniere</li><li>Resolve: Add Fish Recipe/Buerillabaise (Whatever you're missing)</li></ul></li><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Fish Recipe</strong><br /><ul><li>Resolve: Tribute Poissoniere, Ritual Summon <strong>Buerillabaise de Nouvelles</strong>, add&nbsp;<strong>Meat Recipe</strong></li><li>On Resolution: Buerillabaise CL1, Poissoniere CL2<ul><li>Resolve: Scale Poissoniere, Excavate and add (if anything is hit)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Activate&nbsp;<strong>Meat Recipe</strong><ul><li>Resolve: Tribute Level 3+ in hand, Ritual Summon&nbsp;<strong>Poeltis/Foie Glasya de Nouvelles</strong></li><li>On Resolution: Activate <strong>Poeltis/Foie Glasya</strong><ul><li>Resolve: Whatever effect was activated (NOTE: If you summoned Foie Glasya to field, keep at least one Recipe in your own GY)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Use <strong>Poissoniere</strong> target Buerillabaise CL1, Trigger <strong>Poeltis/Foie Glasya</strong> CL2<ul><li>Resolve: Tribute Buerillabaise + Poeltis/Foie Glasya to Summon <strong>Balameuniere de Nouvelles</strong>, Special Summon Poissoniere from scale</li><li>On Resolution: Activate <strong>Balameuniere</strong><ul><li>Resolve: Add&nbsp;<strong>Nouvelles Restaurant ~ At Table</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Activate <strong>Nouvelles Restaurant</strong><ul><li>Resolve: Add <strong>Chef's Special Recipe</strong></li></ul></li><li>Set <strong>Chef's Special Recipe</strong></li><li>If you have a valid target in hand, use <strong>Nouvelles Restaurant</strong> to mulligan for a hand-trap</li><li>On End Phase: Use&nbsp;<strong>Nouvelles Restaurant</strong>, target one Recipe + one other GY target<br /><ul><li>Resolve: Return to deck, draw 1</li></ul></li></ol><p>With this board, your Balameuniere (which was summoned using a Nouvelles Monster's effect) can snipe your opponent's Normal Summon (or any Attack Position monster they bring out, if they choose not to summon in Defense) to bring out <strong>Baelgrill de Nouvelles</strong> on your opponent's turn. When done this way, Baelgrill will DRNM your opponent's Monsters and any face-up Spells/Traps they might have, as well as completely board-wiping their monsters, regardless of whether or not they're in Defense Position. Chef's Special can omni-negate something if the opponent would have Evenly Matched or Dark Ruler No More to try to stop Balameuniere as well, and when Baelgrill is on field, you get one more Quick Effect Tribute to remove one more thing your opponent might try to bring out.</p><p>This is also an incredibly basic opening board - Nouvelles is pretty interesting in that, while its pure-engine plays can get you going, a few non-engine pieces can not only extend you even further, but can sometimes do it with less resources burned. If your starting hand contains either Diviner of the Herald, an Impcantation, or Culinary Confrontation, you're able to extend much farther and get a more complex Nouvelles setup. To be more specific with each, Diviner, if Tributed (which all of your Ritual Summons do) will be able to Special Summon Poissoniere from your Deck for the extra search power and extension. The Impcantations grab a missing piece for your Ritual plays while simultaneously getting more bodies on the field for both Ritual Summons and Nouvelles Summons. And Culinary Confrontation is one of the most versatile Spells for the Nouvelles archetype - it can be used both for preparation, as it E-Teles Poissoniere while getting a second body on the field for your Nouvelles Summons, and it can be used to break walls, as you can use it on your opponent's turn if they're summoning in Defense to get an Attack Position body on the field for Balameuniere to use to bring out Baelgrill and break the opponent's field.</p><hr /><p>Such a fun deck. It's obviously not perfect, but it has a winning matchup against decks like Floowandereeze (who have trouble getting monsters in Defense) and various Link Climb decks. It's easy to pick up and learn, but has enough of a ceiling where there may be plenty of good plays in any situation. I've even been able to land match wins against Swordsoul-Tenyi and Purrely with this exact profile. It's a deceptively difficult deck for opponents to work around that specializes in non-destruction removal of anything and everything that can be thrown at it, and even though it revolves around the funny Hungry Burger, you'll be hard-pressed to call it a meme when you're cooking up opponents left and right.</p>"

It looks like I found how to FTK without <strong><a href=""/deck/372983"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linewalker.</a></strong> Let me explain real quick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mT3JmrX7iwQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Let ""Black Garden"" plant at least one rose to opposing side and destroy Garden with Ancient/Ravenous. Destroying Garden is crucial because we don't want any ATK adjustment coming from Garden. Then, replace the rose with Jizukiru.</p><p>2) Equip Jizukiru with United We Stand + Mage Power + Psychic Blade to boost its ATK by big margin...</p><ul><li>If you have, equip Jizukiru with 3 x United We Stand instead of one and remove Psychic Blade. Since United We Stand costs UR to craft and I got one for free, I had to use Mage Power as substitute.</li><li>Be mindful that United We Stand increases ATK with respect to monsters you have. It doesn't count with respect to your opponent's.</li><li>If you are curious of hypothetical setup for maximum damage, here is the math:<ul><li>3 x United We Stand &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 x (800 x 6) = 14400 damage</li><li>1 x Mage Power &gt;&gt;&gt; 500 x 5 = 2500 damage</li><li>Jizukiru &gt;&gt;&gt; 3300 damage</li><li>Saryuja &gt;&gt;&gt; 300 damage (optional)</li><li>Total = 14400 + 2500 + 3300 + 300 = 20500 damage.</li></ul></li></ul><p>3) Special Summon Pineapple with Saryuja. This is a must because we don't have any Plant monsters but Pineapple + Resurgent and Resurgent needs at most four Plant monsters to Link Summon. Thank goodness Pineapple can change the type of monsters you control to Plant.</p><p>4) Link Summon Resurgent and target Jizukiru, when you have ""Curse Reflection Doll"" in your hand. Then, chain into Doll to deal 13000 damage for the FTK...</p><ul><li>Even if your budget can't afford to craft ""United We Stand"", you can still FTK your opponent with 3 x Mage Power + 1 x Psychic Blade. When chained into Doll, here is the math for total damage:<ul><li>3 x Mage Power &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 x (500 x 5) = 7500 damage</li><li>1 x Psychic Blade &gt;&gt;&gt; 2000 damage</li><li>Jizukiru &gt;&gt;&gt; 3300 damage</li><li>Saryuja &gt;&gt;&gt; 300 damage (optional)</li><li>Total = 7500 + 2000 + 3300 + 300 = 13100 damage.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""United We Stand"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Benghalancer the Resurgent"" can be found within ""Seedling Soul Fey"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Sad to see that the Sinful Spoils engine didn't allow this deck to get a pseudo-Slifer style effect for controlling the board and interrupting plays but it is what it is. Magikuriboh got buffed to half now which is generally a boon for this deck (though it's more of a buff for generic splashes of Dark Magician)- but it for sure means we get to include another half point card in our arsenal. Since the format is expected to be pretty... disgusting with the number of legal engines that generate an obsene amount of advantage, my deck profiles during this season will lean more on the casual side rather than compettive. If you want my competitive picks then look no further than anything incorporating Snake-Eyes, Rescue-Ace, Chaos-Attributed Decks, and Albaz piles. Enough pandering about that stuff though, onto the deck profile.</p><p>It's been brought to my attention that pilots of Dark Magician have been having a hard time navigating the lines of the deck and tripping up on the opener and midgames. If you have any difficulty with the decks I make feel free to contact me at @veissalthen on Discord and I'll try to provide you with replays and/or sample games and testhands to help you get used to the deck. My builds are curated in a specific way so when they're modified slightly to shake-up the gameplan significantly, results can definitely be expected to vary. Please review the lines listed here in the article as points of reference so that you might find yourself comfortable with the build first. With that in mind, this iteration of DM will be focusing primarily on a more controlling and tempo-managment game rather than my Spell-Heavy counterparts. This is mostly just due to the comfort trap cards tend to provide for Trinity duelists rather than having a hand full of plays and enablers. The overall lines remain the same, you just won't have as much gas as before. Reference previous builds for those variations.</p><p>Chronicle Sorceress still isn't here. Please come home.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>- Difficulty -</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>With Dark Burning Magic still banned at this time, the deck's not entirely unga bunga insta-win, but it doesn't exactly feature any real complexities when it comes to finding routes to winning games. The difficulty with this deck lies entirely with managing one's hand, GY, and copies of Dark Magician either between the Deck, GY, or Hand and knowing just how many are where. To get the absolute most out of the deck, you'll likely need to be mindful of where Dark Magician Girl is and how to get Combination in rotation. Resolving Illusion is great and all, but remember that our main deck monsters aren't the greatest here like most other decks you'll encounter, so resolving a search each turn and doing nothing with it will set you further behind compared to a typical turn in modern Trinity.</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>Illusion, Servant, and Rod all communicate with one another very well and so long as you can find any one of those pieces in the opener, then you're basically golden for the remainder of the duel. If you're familiar with the Orcust Trinity then this can be seen largely the same way. As such we have a myriad of ways of accessing Illusion of Chaos (even more so than Rod who is our primary starter since it grabs all of the S/Ts we actually care about). Cycling Rod every turn with Illusion back up is a double search that snowballs rather quickly. We aren't as consistent in this build solely because we have more Trap Cards this time around but Trap Tracks isn't exactly a brick. It doubles as a way of putting Rod in the GY and getting us to impactful backrow.</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>- Sackiness - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong><br /></strong><em>Unfortunately this build isn't on very many Semi and Co-Forbidden cards, so the powerlevel lies strictly within the realm of DM's capabilities. While we do have blowouts with Dark Burning Attack and Dark Magic Attack within their respective gamestates, neither being quick-play is a serious downside when it comes to Trinity tempo. Regardless, Soul Servant's GY effect on average drawing 2 cards with a maxiumum of 4 is pretty hilarious and downright unfair (in a better archetype). If you want to upgrade the sackiness factor, look into jamming more Pointed cards, Bystials, and relevant backrow to steal games. Reduce the skill required to execute DM combos and you'll reduce the skill required to win randomly via a topdeck, frankly speaking.<br /><br /></em><strong>- Viability - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><br /><em>Chaos Attributed deck with decades' worth of support. The deck also plays nicely with reliable backrow, nukes, and can play Bystials of its own when they're sided in against them. While I wouldn't consider Dark Magician to be META, it is without a doubt viable enough to be played in virtually any format that doesn't feature Normal Summon Fallen of Albaz.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Snowball</strong>: You rack up advantage pretty quickly once you get going with this strategy. Between all of the layers of protection and nuance regarding the disruption lines on top of all of the means of searching from over a decade's worth of support? It's honestly difficult not to win after taking the lead.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Runick Engine</strong>: The advantages provided through the currently legal Runick line-up are a bit concerning, at least when it comes to control decks that don't just turtle behind a Link Monster. Being able to chain any one of them in order to either get a free Link Material for Lyna or Dharc; or protection from destruction; or just generating a token to convert later while also blanking a monster/attack in the same way Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon would; on top of just their natural effects is frankly a little silly for a package that doesn't tax the Main Deck in any meaningful way. It also goes without saying that being able to just randomly banish cards from your opponent's deck in a Highlander format is incredibly broken on so many levels as most decks these days require specific cards to function and do not feature ways of recovering said banished cards. You may honestly just win games through the inclusion of this engine alone, so if you find yourself with it, just know that you've not only gotten insurance, but also some pretty potent plusses under The Dark Magicians Fusion.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Comeback Potential</strong>: Just having Illusion, Rod, Controlling the Dark Magician, or even just having Soul Servant in the GY during mid-to-late game will keep you in the game regardless of how things are going. Just don't play too zealously into something like a Trickstar Candina!<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Rewarding Ceiling</strong>: While a lot of the early lines are pretty straightforward, most of the complexities with the archetype as a whole come from the usage of cards in tandem with one another. As opposed to early TCG builds where you kind of just drew cards and hoped it was enough to combo or amass a handtrap/backrow advantage, in Trinity, you'll be much more rewarded for your mastery of the cards at your disposal and how to best navigate the board you're dealt with or expecting. At times the pressure can be nigh suffocating from this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Possible to Brick</strong>: Unlike its TCG counterpart, due to the nature of the format, DM can't exactly take advantage of so much deck-thinning and draw power and while some cards like the Spellbook engine would help with the cycling process a bit, they will always be setting you a turn behind and adding more additional cards to cycle through in the long run. A brick doesn't necessarily equate to your searchers and passing, it's more of the unplayable circumstances of drawing... all of the Dark Magicians and having no way of summoning them. Hence why we've got some backrow to fall back on and ways to cheat him out in the event of a crisis.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Bond Between Teacher and Student</strong>: This particular list makes great use of Dark Magician Girl and cards concerning her (without playing the Magician Girl archetype of course) and as amazing as the cards surrounding her are, she herself is terrible to use. You'll be wanting to bin her whenever possible or simply control her when under gamestates like Magician's Combination. There's even a cheeky setup concerning Brain Controll (or Big Eye) and using her as Xyz material to go into Dhampir Sheridan. All of those applications aside, she (and her Signature Spell) aren't that great and don't feel that great to have until necessary for certain combos.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stat-Checked</strong>: If faced with too many monsters that are 3000 ATK/DEF or above you might run into a brick wall sometimes. You can tech in the Honests to get around this a bit better, but you'll need to hard draw those. Mahad can clear all things that are DARK and Apprentice can help the respective targets clear certain thresholds but most of the time those will be one use situations. Fortunately you can use Soul Servant to stack them from the GY to the top of deck for one final use.</li></ul><p>With introductions over, let's get into the setups you'll want to seek seek more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />Thanks to all of the years of support this archetype has received it has gained a number of searchers and retroactive searchers to help boost its consistency and lines of play to be very reliable which is a massive boon when it comes to limited formats like this one. Generally, any starter will net you the same gamestate no matter what goes down; however, there are some combinations of 2 or more cards that do require a bit more setup.</p><ul><li><strong>Manju &amp; Senju: </strong>Opening one of these cards enables you to grab Illusion of Chaos (or Sauravis if you already have it) then search Magicians' Souls. Using Souls you'll want to setup your GY with either Mana to protect your plays going down the line or DM/DMG to establish them early and get them in rotation for the later stages of the game. Then you'll pivot into either Dharc or Lyna. With Dharc you can grab <strong>Magikuriboh </strong>and use it during that same battle phase (or main phase later) to summon a Dark M agician immediately, <strong>Witch of the Black Forest</strong> if you have particularly greedy setup lines to go for in future turns with fusion plays or revival, or simply <strong>Magician's Rod</strong> who is the best starter in the deck when combined with other cards in the strategy and it's not even close! As for Lyna, <strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</strong> will be our primary find; however, <strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> isn't particularly bad either. The reason why is below.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Diviner of the Herald:</strong> Using its effect to send, we'll pitch Arc Light from our Extra Deck to make it a Level 6 tuner, then we'll use Arc Light to grab Illusion of Chaos from the deck. Using Illusion, we'll pick up Magicians' Souls and send the appropriate targets like within the Manju &amp; Senju lines to the GY to summon it directly from the hand. Then we'll Synchro Summon itno <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. This card being a Level 7 who revives itself and answers the board during the SP is very handy for Rank 7 lines and getting rid of pesky monsters. It's worth noting that her banish effect to bring herself back does come up in this deck so don't use it willy-nilly. Banishing Souls is fine, but everything else in this list definitely is not. Use it within moderation as her effect can be used even on turns where she wasn't sent to the GY since it checks during each of their End Phase's. If you happen to need Rod and have a usable S/T at your disposal, you can summon her back, then use that S/T to tribute her and add back the Magician's Rod at EP to start your turn with your primary searcher. Very handy indeed.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Rod:</strong> This card probably has the highest ceiling regarding its uses since now, with Illusion of Chaos, it can search the entire archetype and its support including adding Dark Magician to the hand when necessary. You may also want to (if on the second turn or later) Link it off into Clara &amp; Rushka so that during the opponent's turn, when you activate an S/T, you can tribute the link to add Rod back to hand. One line I like to particularly setup involves using it as fusion material for <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> by grabbing <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>, that way in the event that the Fusion would be destroyed and I have a S/T I can use, I'd usually tribute away the Dark Magician girl to recycle Rod for next turn. You can also go for some pretty devastating Bond Between Teacher and Student setups when going second (or later in the game) to nuke your opponent's S/Ts or Monsters. It was this particular line of play that actually winded up getting <strong>Dark Burning</strong> <strong>Magic </strong>banned here. Oops.</li></ul><p>The majority of the time you'll want to stick to opening with one of these cards but if you happen to find yourself opening things like just DM or ways to him, it's still fine to cycle your respective S/Ts and support him as necessary. He's still the star of the deck and it's important to make sure you keep up your advantage until you can snowball the game out of controll.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where most games can end for you since the deck can swarm pretty decently after being setup or be rather controlling between Aruru and Mana being a devastating duo.</p><ul><li><strong>Bystial Baldrake: </strong>This card challenges most strategies with just its D.D. Crow effect; however, also being able to bin Dark Magicians, Rods, or resolved Manju/Senjus comes in handy for its tribute cost while still representing a lot of pressure. Additionally, it's a Dragon for a potential Fusion play into Dragon Knights and <em>finally</em>, it is a Level 6 that can be used to make Sheridan or Wollow to completely turn the game on its head proactively rather than reactively. If you can only banish out of your GY, then Servant, Mahad, and the Ritual Package should be fine banishes without any notable lasting consequences. You lose 1 draw for banishing out Palladiums but that's a sacrifice you have to make sometimes. The new addition from AGOV <strong>Seed-Spitting Siblings</strong> serves much of the same purpose. While we don't have many cards that can target our own Monsters in this deck, having it up with DM doubles as a Baldrake that hits ANY Special Summon, not just the Baldrake ones.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Eternal Soul: </strong>Don't flip this card too early without insurance, it immediately puts a target on itself and players usually try to remove it when its face-up every time. That said, it can revive DMs for free and search out your one-sided Heavy Storm whenever you want. Use it to secure a lead or establish one. The safest setup to use it under midgame is definitely when controlling <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> fusion monster, since if Eternal Soul leaves, the fusion would be destroyed but still float into the master and student, ultimately not setting you too far behind.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Soul Servant: </strong>This card's GY effect is rather potent and is virtually unrivaled when it comes to Unlimited power cards in Trinity Format. You'll usually be resolving it to draw two; however, with this build it's possible to draw up to four cards naturally from this effect- and we play TWO copies. The most important things to note about the stacking (and not searching) effect is that you can use it during the EP of your opponent's turn to rig your next draw and <em>the fact that this card can stack cards from your GY to the top of the deck</em> which is very, very potent in a limited format. Don't forget this as it might save you when piloting the deck!</li></ul><p>Should the game not end at this point and you find yourself in a complex, mind-boggling gamestate then you're probably going to want one of the following closers.</p><p><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight &amp; Eternal Soul: </strong>This combination is really rough to deal with, especially since S/T removal is very limited in Trinity, so if this is established you have virtually won. DMtDK is treated as DM so it can be revived by Eternal Soul and is constantly under its protection, additionally, Eternal Soul is protected by DMtDK's continuous effect, making this a really rough situation to navigate for the opponent in most cases. Additionally, since DMtDK is treated as DM, it works with the field spell <strong>Magician's Salvation</strong> and <strong>Magician's Combination</strong> so even something like a DMG can represent DMtDK coming back over and over while protecting said cards in the process. This card is a monster and needs to be respected when properly established.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Magician's Combination: </strong>Probably the most underrated support card this deck has at its disposal. You tag out your DM/DMG to their counterpart and negate any card or effect (just not the activation so no Damage Step shenanigans). Once the opponent has had enough and decides to blow up Combination, it even has a revenge effect to clear a card on their side of the field. You can also force this effect yourself with <strong>Timaeus the United</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Magicians' Souls </strong>turning those plays into removal.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Signature Move: </strong>Though these cards are often considered bad and I even think so most of the time myself, I cannot understate how potent their effects are when they resolve. In all of my history playtesting this deck in any iteration, the games in which the Signature Attacks of the duo have resolved have always resulted in my win. Whether that be the easily accessed <strong>Dark Magic Attack </strong>or the trickier to pull off <strong>Dark Burning Attack</strong> (though you can access it easier with Bond), the signature moves can really just blow away opponents regardless of their deck type and cut the game shorter than what they might have been expecting.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />Since the lines from the archetype itself are rather consistent, the deck can be easy to get started with, but might take a bit to get used to and master; however, it's usability allows a great deal of customizability to cater to most tech choices like Dragonmaids or the legal Bystials to establish DMtDK easier or SPYRAL to do Master Plan setups with Magicians' Souls. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br />Viability Boosters: <em>Kashtira Monsters &amp; Birth | Magician of Dark Illusion (more consistent with Runicks than its own archetype) | Bystials (more Dragon Knights and Rank 6s) | Protecting Spirit Loagaeth | Mana Dragon Zimitron (Runicks do the protection better, this is more so just to loop Servant) | </em><em>Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous | Rescue-ACE (You can summon Cavalry with like every hand and represent draws with DMs Fusion) </em>| <em>Witchcrafter<br /></em><br />General Purpose:<em> Magician of Chaos, High Ritual Art, &amp; Chaos Form, Chicken Game, Destined Rivals, Traptrix Engine, Fiend Engine, Dragonmaid<br /></em></p><p>I'm sure you might've noticed but this version of the build doesn't actually feature very much in the way of gameplan changes despite the modifications done to the main and Extra Deck. Just goes to show how potent the individual cards can be when it comes to promoting and establishing those wincons faster, or just outright being them by themselves. It does rub me the wrong way a bit, but there isn't much to be done about it besides adapt. Dark Magician is timeless and with more support coming in AGOV we're bound to adapt to an even more disgusting level as the card quality increases. Hopefully it just doesn't reach a point where the only Dark Magician cards a DM Deck will play are simply Souls and Illusion of Chaos.</p><hr /><p><strong>50 Card Deck = 4 Points with 4p used.</strong><br />1p Magician's Rod (Extra Copy)<br />1p Soul Servant (Extra Copy)<br />1p Witchcrafter Golem Aruru<br />.5p Magikuriboh<br />.5p Trap Tracks</p><p>I'm currently working on a Dark Magician of Chaos version of the deck that will be my primary focus with Dark Magicians until we get Chronicle Sorceress. Expect this to be the definitive version of my Starter Deck for them in Trinity until further notice. Adjust Spell/Traps as necessary with each format of course. Good luck with the upcoming format.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Nah, this one's more focused primarily on Flip Monsters and cycling decent-to-great Spell Cards. For that sorta vibe, I'd recommend looking into Shaddolls, Thunder Dragons, or Orcust with the entire Bystial engine incorporated for a pretty neat iteration of Chaos Control. As the tagline suggests, this deck takes inspiration mostly from NobodyTCG and Hamtaro, two people that I knew from Trinity's Discord server that had a thing for incorporating strategies from Goat Format into Trinity (for better or worse). They were always fun to see, so here's my take on the formula as well, without being a blatant copycat.</p><p>The strategy takes advantage of the fact that Magician of Faithfulness is Unbound, meaning we get to play three copies of it at no cost to us. This doubles a boon for the sake of building up 3/5 slots towards a Point on top of being able to reference itself for its own effect (which we should be doing pretty regularly, unless we don't already have OG MoF in rotation).</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>- Difficulty -</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>While this deck isn't exactly hard to play, I'd more so argue that it's a challenge to compete with. Since our main deck monsters aren't the best, we'll want to beat up the opponent (irl) in order to nerf them to our level and be on the same playing ground. Focus on cycling your spells as best you can and pivot the Extra Deck where appropriate. While there's frankly insane strategies that can be curated right now in Trinity (like that TCG Unchained Jumpscare that happened last season), any investment that isn't a board wipe usually is considered in our favor as 1 for 1 trades with bad cards is always a plus and battle is usually the most sought-after out to Flip Monsters.</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>Not terribly consistent.

I used to primarily focus on Wagon and Soulpeacemaker but the new cards elevate things to a level of silliness that it's almost recommended to avoid those cards entirely just because they've been powercrept.

I have tested it and I like the draw engine that gen and ken gives (with talents which is crazy). The deck plays alot of garnet and I like to add more consistency to the deck (it has 9 cards out of 45 that can draw engine). Also deployment(or special summoned cartesia) has some nice interaction with gen and ken (because it summons to the opponent's field meaning that albaz can fuse turn 0). I did not add thrust because I don't own it. If I did, I'd remove 3 nadir and 2 talents and I'd add 3 thrust, 1 duplication + any thurst target.

Reupload in articles at your behest.","<p>This article raises a discussion point that I feel like is often ignored (and was often ignored even during the time I was actively participating in Trinity) concerning the fundamental gameplay of it and how tempo swings without the reliance of specific outs, counters, or archetypal dominance can often be rewarded. This discussion stems solely from the principle of the 3 Effect Monster Summon Limit per turn and not so much deckbuilding by itself; however, the ideas presented here should put a spotlight on things that are often overlooked and misunderstood to be happening during games, especially when it comes to conversion of value and simply conversations between cards between a player's turns.<br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 8pt;""><em>Full disclosure: Since I can't upload articles directly to this site, this is going up as a deck profile with the article attached. Anyone who has the capability of uploading articles for Trinity feel free to canabalize this piece and reupload at your leisure. I will unlist this in the event that transpires. Just remember to give credit. ^^</em></span></p><hr /><p>The restricting factor of the 3 Effect Monster Summon limit per turn is one of the defining features of Trinity Format and what makes it separate from other alternative formats. While it does create quite the bottleneck situation for jamming in as many powerful cards and plays within the same turn and ultimately makes trumping the 2nd or even more pivotal- 3rd summon with interaction rather game-deciding at times, it franky comes with the territory and is something that a veteran generally learns to respect rather than going blindly all-in all the time. Due to the nature of the summon limit, plays are often cut off from being at their full potential, even those that bear the greatest resemblance to their TCG counterparts (or in some cases are quite literally just direct imports from Advanced to here). In my time as a semi-competitive player and analyst of the format, I always noticed how cards that stuck around to convert into Extra Deck plays (generally things like Accesscode Talker, Borrelsword, and even the lower bound of Knightmare Unicorn) actively turned into a snowball regardless of the associated strategy, deck type, or advantage state of the players. This is primarily because regardless of how great one's deck actually performs, in the sea of being expected to win or lose games primarily through battle damage, you can at least rest assured that you have a buffer to protect you from being outright OTKed (and often times regularly drawing out games to Turn 4 and beyond when interaction is had). In the case of low ATK power strategies this is even more apparent as they simply just don't deal enough damage to put the pressure on, instead representing threats in another way. This is part of why it's fine to use LP as a resource; however, this also introduces the factor that one can just use the turns themselves as a resource, no?</p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">As previously stated, the preservation of a monster(s) going into your turn to start with that don't actively take away from your 3 Summons for the turn are a boon that can often lead to a tempo swing so great it casts a hard shadow over any card advantage. Speaking from experience, I knew this to be the case with decks that played on both players turns or featured floaters and resource loops to maintain field presence even when cards were lost. In my case this was primarily showcased with my favorite deck in <strong>Shaddolls </strong>but even without the advantages provided from such a strategy, resolving things that would protect your monsters or simply disrupt a play from the opponent on their turn (even if it didn't necessaily prevent their monsters from occupying the board) would still preserve your monsters in the end. </span></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">Lightning Rods<br /></span></strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The art of misdirection is rather deadly in a resource-driven card game.</span></em></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Since this tempo swing exists, wouldn't it then make sense to put greater value on cards that can effectively interact with the opponent in a meaningfully-adjacent way? Well, kind of.&nbsp; Sadly with this game, all cards aren't created equal. A card like <strong>Blockout Curtain</strong> for example fufills the preservation topic in question but serves as one of the worst buffers by far (though the GY effect can be cheeky as a counter to some destruction-based strategies). The advantage of cards that are Continuous is that their conversion can actually be directly extended between turns. Therefore, it would make the most sense to instead play cards that either generate continuous advantage over time or put the opponent on a clock in the continuous slot rather than rely solely on redirecting abilities such as this one. For example, for as slow as cards like <strong>Wave Motion Cannon</strong> and <strong>Cauldron of the Old Man</strong> are to start out, they will put the opponent on a timer regardless and only actively punish the user if they're using the effects greedily. With a target placed on such cards, the opponent is thereby forced to close out the game faster or resort to wasting removal on said cards which don't even need to necessarily contribute to a burn-specific gameplan. You regardless have protected your other Spell/Traps and/or in some cases of omni-targeting destruction, have saved yourself a headache down the line. With one of the most referenced outs to Spell/Trap Removals existing in<strong> Knightmare Phoenix</strong>, you have effectively made the opponent give up their board, summons, and a Discard to out a card that was never your win condition to begin with.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">This is a much more elegant usage of a redirection tactic and makes the errors lie mostly within the opponent's court for misplays as their decisions will ultimately decide their clock, turns to kill, and how best to convert what they have into an answer when the time feels appropriate.</span></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">Preservation of Field<br /></span></strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><em>Monster Conversions are always valuable.</em></span><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><br /></span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">As mentioned before with my addressal of Shaddolls, there are inherent strengths provided to anyone who can actually preserve their monsters between turns</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">. This is generally taken for granted by most players who only look at the game as starters and end-boards rather than as a card game altogether and often can lead to easily-avoided defeat circumstances. This is generally evidenced in losses where decks that can easily pump out Rank 4s or Synchro 8s aren't running Abyss Dweller nor Crimson Blader in matches where they would only stand to benefit from it. Instead choosing to simply blindly attack and destroy cards until something ultimately sticks. While I agree that removing monsters by battle is effecient and a clean +1 per monster defeated (on top of anything that was used to go into it), it is a very easy bottleneck to deal with and makes cards like <strong>Mirror Force</strong> criminally underrated for just stealing games. This then begs the question of what sorts of cards to preserve one's field are the most effective then? </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Well, cards are always getting released and powercrept out and while this isn't entirely intended to be a showcase of specific cards to be running in your matches, I'll at least highlight some ideas for preservation tactics.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The aforementioned Mirror Forces are great for swinging a game instantly and has counterparts that can trade one for one or in some cases outright take control of the monster, but it does ultimately come down to building up where the faults of a deck might lie. Blue-Eyes strategies as an example will actively command the board with large monsters that have some of the highest attack to try and out consistently, making the process generally exhausting to deal with. It's for this reason that they don't necessarily benefit from running battle-stops as much as they would removal-stops. It shouldn't be so much as a protect-the-castle strategy might commit but you can definitely understand the benefit of maintaining a 3k+ Beatstick on the board to start your turn with- bonus points if that monster has a level and be converted into an even more powerful Rank 8.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">For most decks I would argue this isn't really the case and protections of this variety (barring exactly <strong>Forbidden Lance</strong> and similar cards) should be avoided in favor of blanket battle-stops or ressurection tricks. This is obviously prominent in the Mirror Forces but what about for opponents that would be safe and convert things into a removal monster to get rid of the backrow in question first before attacking? Well, then you'd need something chainable right? Obviously we aren't going to run something like Fake Trap to preserve our cards here, no, but unironically committing to something like a <strong>Threatening Roar</strong> does go a long way, especially after the opponent has already gone through lengths to commit several summons into an expected board-clear with their battle phase. Denying them attacks on your monsters keeps them around and forces strictly effect removal to deal with them going into your next turn. It also outright denies on-attack effects altogether. Waboku is in a similar boat but lacks the on-attack prevention, it instead can be used for triggering your own on-attack related effects without losing your monsters (i.e. War Rocks). This is a rather underrated method of keeping your advantage and doesn't really matter when in the game it's around so long as you aren't in a top decking situation to begin with. Denying your opponent the ability to make clean outs to your board while ultimately preserving most if not all of your monsters will always be to your benefit due to the Summon Limit restriction of the format.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Lastly, this can be achieved with blinking effects like your <strong>Interdimensional Matter</strong> <strong>Transporter </strong>type of effects. While I would generally run Book of Moon,&nbsp; Sol &amp; Luna, or Forbidden Lance over that card specfically, this does actually carry some substantial weight in the form of a Monster Effect that can do the same thing. Such is the case for cards like the <strong>Bunny Ear Enthusiast</strong> who can preserve your own monsters and itself <em>or </em>simply be a Wind-Up Rabbit but also blink out your Opponent's Monster until your next turn (similar to Timebreaker Magician or PSY-Framelord Zeta if you're familiar with those cards). D.D. Seeker deserves an honorable mention as well but can be messy to plan around, especially in the case of dealing with interaction; however, that card can ultimately preserve more monsters than Bunny in the long-term. A card that fits this bill and the Waboku category is <strong>Ichiroku's Ledger Book</strong> in case you were looking for something of that variety.</span></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Using cards like these can often be completely ruled out for being ""gimmicky"" or ""neutral/negative"" in terms of immediate advantage when it comes to snapshot gamestates; however, the most important things to consider are the strengths and weakenesses of the strategies you're intending to play. While I imagine there's all sorts of legal burn FTKs or ways to rip your opponent's entire hand before they get the opportunity to play around, you're objectively the most likely to encounter loses due to 60% or more of it being from Battle Damage in Trinity Format. Modern players focus a lot on effeciency and value and not time to kill nor what to actually do when you are bricked into oblivion with a hand full of Garnets. These preservation tactics shouldn't be overlooked solely because they aren't abiding by the formula you might find popular in the format or Advanced. Trinity Format is a very different game with a very different ruleset. While it's fair to assess that wins can be handed to someone on a silver platter for running objectively broken and toxic cards, there's nothing to be said for near-equal matchups between pilots who understand their decks besides misplays and outplays. Adding more to the table to swing such moments undeniably in your favor should be pursued, not avoided and would frankly invite more to the table when deck building and discussing the topic of what makes a Staple a Staple.<br /></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">At the end of the day, the cards exist to be used. Cards that are generally quite middling or ""whatever"" quality at the time of their printing may give your exponentially high returns when put into practice in this 3 Summon Format. You don't lose anything from experimenting with practice and you only stand to gain if you invetiably win on the backs of said preservation tactics. <em>This also totally allows you to pump out Link 4s and 5s pretty regularly like some decks such as Traptrix, Ghostrick, and Altergeist are capable of doing despite objectively <strong>not</strong> being Link-Spam combo decks.</em></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Thanks for reading!<br /><em><span style=""font-size: 8pt;"">enjoy the random deck profile</span></em></p><p><br /><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Legatia offers extra protection for Novox to survive whatever your opponent does, while Barrier protects Legatia as well. You can then on Turn 2 use Skull Guardian's effect to negate an opponent's card or effect and bring Primera into a Monster Zone. This will trigger Stand Up allowing you to Synchro into Crimson Dragon using Skull and Novox. Then when your opponent does something else, use Crimson Dragon to target Legatia and summon Sifr or Blazar Dragon, giving you further negates and similarly large bodies comparable to Skull Guardian.

Materiactor Gigaboros,"<p>Hey, ever wondered how to FTK your opponent with Number 43 alongside monsters which raise their ATK or DEF? There are some of them, which boost their ATK/DEF with respect to cards you have in-hand. Slifer is well-known, as seen in ""Side Deck"". You can check other options in there but I decided to do it with Gigaboros. Feel free to replace Gigaboros with anything in ""Side Deck"", if you don't like it. Let's get started!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTZwNSWnzdg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces with ""Primal Seed"" duo from Banish Zone (BZ). In addition, you can enlarge your hand by targeting ""Primal Seed"" duo each other to add additional cards.</p><p>2) First, XYZ Summon Gigaboros by using Level 3 monsters (Martial/Integrator/Shamisen) as materials. Then, place it on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) but better clean here with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" before doing anything. You can revive Level 3 monsters with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>3) Similar to what was explained in #2, XYZ Summon Number 43 twice by utilizing Caligo + Vata + Sharnga as materials. Place Number 43 fellas on Main Monster Zone (MMZ).</p><p>4) With a large hand, Gigaboros will grow up. When you think it's enough, play ""Mystik Wok"" and target on Gigaboros. With 2 x Number 43 monsters present, healing can be converted and dealt as damage, twice, for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Sharnga"" + ""Vata"" can be collected by purchasing ""Blackwing's Pride"" deck. 60 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 480 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Mythical Beast Cerberus,"<p>So, you might have heard of Endymion decks, where they excel at utilizing Spell Counters for big plays. Endymions were also known alongside their Mythical Beasts and Cerberus is one of them, seen in ""Side Deck"". Yet, did you know its OG variant was actually completely different? In this deck, you will see it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nI8qL4kR_G8"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Special Summon ""Mythical Beast Cerberus"" as early as possible to boost its ATK whenever you play a spell and place Spell Counter on it. Here are the possible scenarios...</p><ul><li>In the very beginning, if you have opened with Monk and pulled out Panda, that means Ancient can bring forth Cerberus without breaking any plans or Extra Deck summons.</li><li>If you have only started with Panda, that means you have to rely on some of Endymions:<ul><li>If you don't have none of Endymions but ""Spell Power Mastery"", tutor one of them. ""Servant of Endymion"" can pull out Cerberus from your deck while ""Reflection of Endymion"" can pull out Cerberus from your hand. Choose it wisely.</li><li>When you have used one of their abilities, you need to alleviate your board space issues for Extra Deck summons by playing ""Monster Recovery"" and targeting on either Servant or Reflection. After playing ""Monster Recovery"", don't forget to spare one Pendulum Zone for ME-PSY-YA, which is essential for ""Primal Seed"" setup.</li><li>If you don't like any of these options, remove Endymion cards in addition to ""Monster Recovery"" and either add ""Double Summon"" or ""Trismagistus"" to Special Summon Cerberus whenever possible. You can check them in ""Side Deck"". The drawback is that you might have to play lots of spells to boost Cerberus, which can take more time than usual.</li><li>If you still don't like anything being offered, you can Special Summon Cerberus with Saryuja but prepare for APM actions with ""Primal Seed"" setup, which will be explained later on.</li></ul></li></ul><p>2) XYZ Summon Number 13 by using 2 x Level 1 monsters as materials. Then, Link Summon Saryuja by using 4 materials, one of which has to be Number 13.</p><p>3) Although not shown in this video, if you are still lacking power for Cerberus, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed for ""Primal Seed"", so that we can target ""Primal Seed"" duo each other to play spells forever and raise the ATK of Cerberus. As long as you don't banish Number 13 with Chaos, everything will be fine.</p><p>4) When the ATK of Cerberus is higher than your opponent's LP, revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"". If there is no space, ""Mystik Wok"" can help in that regard. Then, overlay into Number 43 by playing ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"".</p><p>5) Finally, play ""Mystik Wok"" and target on Cerberus. Don't forget to choose its ATK. With healing to damage conversion via Number 43, you can FTK your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Spell Power Mastery"" + ""Servant of Endymion"" + ""Reflection of Endymion"" can be found within ""Knowledge of the Mythlords"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

Her stats are decent, being able to beat over 1900 ATK beat sticks as well as having 2100 DEF, being able to also provide a decent defensive wall if needed.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/91932350.jpg"" title=""Harpie Lady 1 (91932350)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""91932350"" alt=""image"" />Next we have <strong>Harpie Lady 1.</strong> She is another standard inclusion that can boost other wind monsters ATK by 300. We include two of her to help fuel the Elegant Egotist special summon as well as boost our bird swarm.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/27927359.jpg"" title=""Harpie Lady 2 (27927359)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""27927359"" alt=""image"" /> <strong>Harpie Lady 2</strong> is our other Harpie inclusion, helping negate flip effect monsters when destroyed by battle. She can searched out by Birdface and Flying Kamakiri if needed.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/73001017.jpg"" title=""Silpheed (73001017)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""73001017"" alt=""image"" /> <strong>Silpheed</strong> is a great inclusion in any wind deck. His effect to force your opponent to discard a card when destroyed by battle is crazy. If your opponent wants to dodge this effect, they'll be forced to use another card to get him off the field.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/45547649.jpg"" title=""Birdface (45547649)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""45547649"" alt=""image"" /> <strong>Birdface</strong> is another staple of Harpie decks, being able to search out any of them when destroyed by battle.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/84834865.jpg"" title=""Flying Kamakiri #1 (84834865)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""84834865"" alt=""image"" /> <strong>Flying Kamakiri #1</strong> is yet another floater in our deck.

Her effect is basically a walking Giant Trunade. If the Sisters are bricking, you can pitch them to activate this effect and summon Silpheed with said discard.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/43586926.jpg"" title=""Twin-Headed Behemoth (43586926)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""43586926"" alt=""image"" /> <strong>Twin-Headed Behemoth</strong> needs no introduction.

This card is an exceptional beater that essentially forces your opponent to use a banish effect to get rid of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The other two non-engine cards are <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=71413901"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/71413901.jpg"" data-card=""71413901"" data-name=""Breaker the Magical Warrior"">Breaker the Magical Warrior</span></a> and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26202165"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26202165.jpg"" data-card=""26202165"" data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</span></a> . These are just no-brainer staples to include in the deck. Next I'm going to get into a few of the spell and traps (I'm only going to discuss the relevant non-staples to save you some reading).</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/12181376.jpg"" title=""Triangle Ecstasy Spark (12181376)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""12181376"" alt=""image"" /><strong>Triangle Ecstasy Spark</strong> is a comfortable one-of in the deck that can be used to close out games. If your opponent is low on life points, this will give you a sure-fire method to finish them off.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/75782277.jpg"" title=""Harpies' Hunting Ground (75782277)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""75782277"" alt=""image"" /><strong>Harpies' Hunting Ground</strong> is another great card in your playbook. Not only does it give you an ATK boost, but can also pop a back row card every time you summon a Harpie. The only thing to keep in mind is that this effect is mandatory, so be careful when you summon your monsters.</p><p><img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/90219263.jpg"" title=""Elegant Egotist (90219263)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""90219263"" alt=""image"" />&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we arrive at the last in-engine card: <strong>Elegant Egotist.</strong> This can be used to special summon a Harpie Lady while you control another one. This card is crazy as it is one of the few in the format that can special summon FROM the deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Every other spell/trap in this deck mostly fall into the staple category, but there are a couple to highlight. <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=97169186"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/97169186.jpg"" data-card=""97169186"" data-name=""Smashing Ground"">Smashing Ground</span></a> is our card to counter aggro decks - I picked that one over Sakuretsu as we are main decking <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=51452091"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/51452091.jpg"" data-card=""51452091"" data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</span></a> . Considering Harpies don't utilize any specific traps, I think it fits in very nicely with the deck. It also means we have better odds of using Hunting Ground without having to pop our own back row, since we only run four traps that can set.</p><p>The fusion deck consists solely of cheap Wind monsters to act as a bluff as we are never going to use it with this deck.</p><p>Finally, I'll cap off this deck with a quick run down of the side deck.

This deck, if you watch the movie, belongs to&nbsp;<strong>Skye Zaizen</strong>, or the original&nbsp;<strong>Aoi Zaizen</strong>! In the movie, in addition to the above deck, she also owns an equally powerful deck of cards,&nbsp;<strong>which is Marincess</strong>. Although she only plays a background role for supporting characters, her cards have left an extremely strong impression on players, especially players who love waifu :v. Here, let's learn about the artwork... oh wrong, learn about these girls and how to build a complete deck of&nbsp;<strong>Marincess cards</strong>!<br /><br /><strong>Strengths and weaknesses:</strong></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><strong><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">Marincess</span></strong><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">&nbsp;in particular and&nbsp;<strong>Cyberse</strong>&nbsp;in general are both decks capable of creating good combos. However, compared to some other decks,&nbsp;<strong>Marincess</strong>&nbsp;has outstanding advantages in the following points.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">First,&nbsp;<strong>Marincess</strong>&nbsp;possesses the ability to overcome opponents' interruptions quite well. If compared to Ignister, if Ignister takes a handtrap, you will be able to pass that turn. However, with Marincess, because your extenders are quite large, you can immediately switch to plans B and C that you have set up. Second,&nbsp;<strong>Marincess</strong>&nbsp;needs few cards in the Main Deck to operate. Therefore, you can add common cards like Nibiru, handtraps, etc. to block your opponent's path. Third, this strength is similar to Salamangreat, Marincess's ability to recycle resources is extremely good, with tools like&nbsp;<strong>Blue Slug, Coral Anenome, Coral Triangle or Marbled Rock.</strong></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">However, besides that, Marincess has quite fatal weaknesses. That is our boss monster, to be unaffected depends on the survival of the field. If the field is lost, the enhancement will be lost (the increased or unaffected attack will be lost). Although the resource recovery ability is quite good, it burns resources extremely quickly. With each summon to a boss, it takes us nearly half an Extra to reach it. Therefore,&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, although very powerful, is difficult to use in decks.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">Those are the strengths and weaknesses we learned when playing&nbsp;<strong>Marincess</strong>.

When called to the field,&nbsp;<strong>Blue Tang</strong>&nbsp;will send you a&nbsp;<strong>Marincess monster to the grave</strong>. There are quite a few targets for us to send to the grave, for example, Marincess that have the ability to jump from their hand, such as&nbsp;<strong>Sea Horse, Springirl, Sleepy</strong>&nbsp;Maiden and then add them to their hand thanks to Blue Slug. Or monsters that have good ability to stay in the grave like&nbsp;<strong>Mandarin</strong>&nbsp;(to spam fields), or Pascalus (recycle traps).</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">When sending to the Graveyard as a Link Summon material for a WATER monster, you can turn over the first 3 cards of the deck and add 1 Marincess from the deck to your hand. You will often use this card to chain block Link 1 monsters. Specifically: You will use Blue Tang to build Blue Slug (for example), at this time, arrange&nbsp;<strong>Blue Slug</strong>&nbsp;<strong>chain link 1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Blue Tang chain link 2</strong>. At that time,&nbsp;<strong>Blue Tang</strong>&nbsp;will help you avoid&nbsp;<strong>handtraps</strong>&nbsp;that can&nbsp;<strong>target Blue Slug</strong>, helping the combo circuit to take place&nbsp;<strong>more completely</strong>.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">It can be said that&nbsp;<strong>Blue Tang</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely important card, starting the operating system of the entire deck.&nbsp;<strong>Playing 3</strong>&nbsp;is out of the question.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><strong><em><u><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #1f4e79; mso-themecolor: accent1; mso-themeshade: 128; mso-style-textfill-fill-color: #1F4E79; mso-style-textfill-fill-themecolor: accent1; mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha: 100.0%; mso-style-textfill-fill-colortransforms: lumm=50000;"">Marincess Sea Horse</span></u></em></strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; line-height: normal;""><span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN;"">The second starter of the deck. The ability to jump without chaining is very strong, as long as you only need to own 1 Marincess link monster with an arrow that can only enter 1 Main Monster Zone box. With just&nbsp;<strong>1 Sea Horse</strong>, you can&nbsp;<strong>create 1 link of 3 easily</strong>. (I will tell you the specific combo later!). The second effect is also very good, although rarely used, it sometimes helps you remove weights very well, allowing you to call up 1 WATER from your hand into the box the Marincess link points to.

Panda+Arcana Force+Numeron Network,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>Think slow but act quick! One mistake and you can fail, better practice under 300 sec before jumping on Ranked.)</p><p>Good day to you! If you are looking at this deck, that means you must have been interested into Numeron decks. Technically speaking, C1 is mostly used as emergency rather than burst, where you can banish all monsters and burst damage is low, if only XYZ s banished were Numerons. What if I told you that burst damage can go high only with your cards, ranging up to 15k, and you can do all in one turn thanks to Panda and Arcana? If you are still curious, keep reading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0bHv7-wKOU"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. We will find lots of combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards, that's why. Also, don't forget to place ""Light Barrier"" on Field Zone.</p><p>2) Revive Arcana either with Saryuja or ""Monster Reborn"". Pick&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> as outcome to always skip your opponent's turn, at the cost of two monsters of yours being sent to GY. Then, revive Accel with ""Monster Reborn""...</p><ul><li>""Light Barrier"" guarantees the outcome of Arcana without coin flip but you don't have to use Barrier, since you can kill Arcana with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" to reset and try again with ""Monster Reborn"". It's irrelevant until the big setup is ready but Barrier saves you a lot of time for hitting the right outcome.</li></ul><p>3) XYZ Summon Number 62 and then overlay into C62, all thanks to using Arcana + Accel as materials. Then, destroy it with Offerings...</p><ul><li>This setup is the easiest XYZ Summon you could ever possibly do, which can be also considered as highest potential burst later on. If you don't have C62, you can replace it with ""Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon"" to overlay with Number 62. You can check it in ""Side Deck"".</li><li>If you don't have any of these XYZ cards, replace them with ""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon"", seen in ""Side Deck"". Rather than spending UR, you can spend gems to buy ""Rage of Cipher"" structure deck to have at least two of them.</li></ul><p>4) Revive Accel + Arcana with ""Monster Reborn"" and XYZ Summon Number 97 by using them as materials. Destroy Number 97 with Offerings and XYZ Summon Number 97 one more time with same monsters...</p><ul><li>Although not used in this deck, if you wish to increase burst damage further, Number 22 is the highest one as Level 8 DARK XYZ monster, seen in ""Side Deck"". However, there is a catch: You have to use Level 8 DARK monsters as materials. So, you have to place ""Lair of Darkness"" to change attribute of all monsters into DARK to XYZ Summon Number 22 later on. Otherwise, Number 97 is the cheapest (R) to craft and carry through on your plan.</li></ul><p>5) With big XYZ monsters in your GY, it's time to send Chaos Emperor to the same area. If you have ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and ""Monster Reincarnation"" in your hand, destroy Chaos Emperor with Offerings and return it to your hand with Reincarnation. Then, banish 1 LIGHT XYZ and 1 DARK XYZ to Special Summon Chaos Emperor. Repeat the same process but not before you have Offerings + Reincarnation in your hand, which can be found with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>6) Revive 3 x Level 1 monsters with ""Monster Reborn"" and XYZ Summon Number 1 by using these little dudes as materials. Then, repeat #5 one more time to not banish Chaos Emperor by accident and have him ready in your hand.</p><p>7) Overlay into C1 with Number 1. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor by banishing Number 1 and any DARK monster. This time, revive Arcana with ""Monster Reborn"" when ""Light Barrier"" is present. As explained in #2, choose the outcome as <strong>heads.</strong> If you don't want to use ""Light Barrier"", good luck hitting&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> because if you don't, get ready for searching Offering + Monster Reborn with ""Primal Seed"" cards.</p><p>8) With turn skip trick ready, don't forget to have at least two more monsters on your side for Arcana to send them to GY. After placing ""Numeron Network"" on the field, you can end your turn and skip your opponent's one by sending two monsters you control but Arcana to GY...</p><ul><li>Also, to not miss out anything, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</li></ul><p>9) It's your turn now. Activate C1 to bring forth and deal 15000 damage in total for the FTK. Rather than banishing XYZ monsters on the field, banishing XYZ monsters from GY via Chaos Emperor also works for C1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number C1"" + ""Numeron Network"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- As of this writing, ""Number 62"" and ""Number C62"" can be found within timed pack called ""Galactic Evolution"" to save 60 UR! Don't miss them out before it's too late. However, once they are gone, you can instead find ""Number 62"" and ""Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon"" within ""Nebula Cyclone"" Secret Pack to carry on with the same plan, still costing 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR! If you wish, you can cut ""Light Barrier"" but be mindful of consequences explained in the guide. Consequently, you can also cut 3 x ""Chicken Game"" to save 90 UR as well because Ancient won't have anything to tutor by removing four field spells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 330 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems and/or want to remove some cards. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Number 100+Coltwing+Xiangsheng+Mystik Wok,"<p>Hey! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with ""Number 43"" thanks to ""Number 100"" but not with well-known setup. Instead of Utopiforce where damage output is limited, we will turn our thinking around to deal as high as 255k damage! Yes, you heard me right, so why don't you take a look?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2OyxU8AD-A"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, discard at least one of Coltwings with Ravenous but try to aim discarding both, if you can.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards. Also, place Xiangsheng, which will play in an important role later on.</p><p>3) Before you do anything, clear everything on Main Monster Zones (MMZ) but Chaos Emperor with ""Offerings to the Doomed"". Then, Special Summon both Coltwings with the help of Saryuja and ""Monster Reborn"". By reviving both Coltwings, you will fill last remaining spots with two tokens.</p><p>4) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 10</li><li>New calculation = Token (10) + Token (10) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (24)</li></ul><p>5) Repeat the step explained in #4, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>6) When you think it's enough, clear tokens with Offerings. You can also clear Saryuja and Coltwings afterwards for more space, if you wish.</p><p>7) XYZ Summon both ""Number 13"" monsters with Level 1 monsters. Then, XYZ Summon ""Number 100"" because you fit the criteria.</p><p>8) So, you have ""Number 100"" and high level Chaos. Activate Xiangsheng to raise the rank of ""Number 100"" up to the level of Chaos by targeting both.</p><p>9) Activate the ability of ""Number 100"" by detaching one of Number 13 monsters to increase its ATK. Since you have a XYZ monster with high amount of Rank, the ATK of Number 13 will be naturally higher than your opponent's LP.</p><p>10) Revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"".</p><p>11) Play ""Mystik Wok"" and target on ""Number 100"". Choose its ATK to convert healing into damage with Number 43 for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Number 100: Numeron Dragon"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR! Also, as of this writing, you can try finding it from ""Galactic Evolution"" timed pack.</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 480 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

The Dark Magicians+Magical Contract Door,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>For this deck to work, you have to act calm but play quick. I suggest you practicing under 300 sec rule before moving onto Ranked. Otherwise, it's fine to play on Casual with 480 sec.)</p><p>Greetings! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with ""Rebirth of Seventh Emperors"" while trying to repeat as many times as we can with ""The Dark Magicians"" + ""De-Fusion"" combination alongside giving our opponent extra cards with ""Gold Moon Coin"" + ""Magical Contract Door"" to increase burn potential. Let me show you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojpAMFBl-Lo"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Throughout the game, XYZ Summon ""Djinn"" by using 2 x Cthugua as materials. Then, overlay into ""C39"" with ""Limited Barian's Force"". Also, don't forget to XYZ Summon ""Number 39"" with 2 x Level 1 monsters as materials.</p><p>2) Link Summon Saryuja by using 4 materials, one of which has to be C39 and shouldn't be Number 39 at all.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. Banish targets has to be Djinn + C39 no matter what. Also, with ME-PSY-YA + Chaos Emperor present, you can find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards no problem.</p><p>4) Try depleting your Main Deck by playing ""Into the Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"". If you must, don't forget to fetch banished DARK monsters with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>5) Play ""Polymerization"" to bring forth ""The Dark Magicians"" by using ""Fusion Parasite"" + Spellcaster as materials. Then, play ""The Humble Sentry"" to reshuffle Seventh Emperors and activate ""The Dark Magicians"" to draw Seventh Emperors to play it later on.</p><p>6) Activate Seventh Emperors. Number 39 will be automatically tributed. Remember banished XYZ monsters by Chaos Emperor? Now, you can Special Summon one of them and it has to be Djinn. Later on, it will be C39. In short, while picking targets, pick opposite attributed monster of what was present before. LIGHT &gt;&gt;&gt; DARK &gt;&gt;&gt; LIGHT &gt;&gt;&gt; DARK etc.</p><p>7) In order to play Seventh Emperors again, we have to reset ""The Dark Magicians"" and do the trick explained in #5. Just play ""De-Fusion"" and bring out materials to reuse them again with ""Fusion Parasite"".</p><p>8) When there is nothing to pick with Seventh Emperors, that means it's time to banish with Chaos Emperor for another time. If you have done everything right, C39 should be the one present on the battlefield. After you have placed your first Chaos Emperor on top of your deck with ""Back to Square One"", you can banish other XYZ monsters with second Chaos Emperor, which are Djinn + Number 39.</p><p>9) Fetch the first Chaos Emperor with ""Magical Contract Door"" to empty your Main Deck, again. As long as you give a spell other than combo pieces, you will be fine. This step is where you can enlarge your opponent's hand besides ""Gold Moon Coin"" and it can be repeated, provided that you have reshuffled the first Chaos Emperor with ""The Humble Sentry"".</p><p>10) Repeat the whole process from #5 to #9 until you had it enough. To sum up...</p><ul><li>Use ""The Dark Magicians"" alongside ""The Humble Sentry"" to activate ""Seventh Emperors"" later on. Pick opposite attributed target of what was tributed before. Reset with ""De-Fusion"" afterwards.</li><li>When there is nothing to banish, shuffle Chaos Emperor with ""Back to Square One"" and rebanish other XYZ s with different Chaos Emperor. Then, fetch it with ""Magical Contract Door"" and give your opponent a spell as a gift.</li></ul><p>11) Before you end your turn, change the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"". It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup. After you have ended your turn, confirm ""Into the Void"" first to not take any damage from ""Seventh Emperors"". Then, click all ""Seventh Emperors"" for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Magical Contract Door"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 510 SR and 120 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems and/or want to remove some cards. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

In addition, although less used, you can draw 1 card if a monster leaves the field by Normal Trap and specially summon 1 Fiend/ Set 1 Spell or Trap from your hand.

The summon conditions are simple, just have a Labrynth card or Normal Trap activated during that turn to get on the field. Besides, when there is a Normal Trap activated, you have the right to Set 1 Normal Trap with another name with it from the Deck. Our deck has many Normal Traps that can be used in many different situations, such as Dimensional Barrier to lock summon, or Infinite Impermanence to negate the opponent's monster effect,... In addition, when there is a set card, Lady Labrynth cannot be targeted as well as destroyed by the opponent effect, so the opponent will have a hard time if you want to prevent Lady Labrynth from giving you an advantage.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: 'Calibri Light','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; color: #0a0a0a;"">Usually, when you or your opponent clicks the trap, arrange the Lady Labrynth to activate first and then you should activate the effect of the card you want.

And I'll keep my eyes on winning, JUST LIKE HOW YOU ALL WANTED!!","<p>I've designed quite a few decks that can attempt to use Z-ARC in some capacity and thanks to the cards introduced in AGOV, you only technically need to run Gate Magician and Soul of the Supreme Celestial King in the Main Deck if you want to include it. That said, since it's still Pendulum and additionally it's an anime protagonist's deck, it has plenty of cards to support finding those same pieces and expanding on them further without the need of relying on cards outside of the engine. So, enhancing the PendMa engine further (though I consider this to be horizontal in terms of overall power and not necessarily better than it), witness, Z-ARC!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br /><strong>- Difficulty -</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆<br /></strong><em>Despite this being a midrange deck, your 4k/4k boss monster doesn't actually do anything. The original Z-ARC is banned at the time of writing this but a 4k/4k that can continually summon itself and gain protections whilst enhancing the effects of our cards isn't awful. It just makes it so that we don't have to play protect the castle at all. We can just focus on winning the game and navigating the board. Due to the fact that the wincon doesn't do much besides be a large body then, most of the difficulty comes from it being a pendulum deck and needing to make decisions between whether or not certain cards are better as scales or as summons that turn. Lastly, you'll need to have a Supreme King Gate occupying the Pend Zone sometimes or dual Magician Scales at others to proc some of the most impactful effects in this deck<strong>. </strong>Don't you just love Pendulum in Highlander?</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br />★★★☆☆</strong><br /><em>Most hands you should setup a Pendulum Magician play or Z-ARC; however, it's worth pointing out that since we're not on Joker our consistency is decreased by a small margin when it comes to specifically utitlizing the Odd-Eyes cards by themselves. If you were to update the strategy, I would strongly recommend paying the 1p for Performapal Skullcrobat Joker and either dropping a Duelist Alliance or going up to 50.</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>- Sackiness - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong><br /></strong><em>Pendulum Call is the only real luck sacking card here. Everything else we do is literally setup. Though, we're technically on 3 copies of Pendulum Call and one way to loop it from the GY so... eh. If original Z-ARC wasn't banned this deck would sack quite a bit through resummoning it over and over.<br /><br /></em><strong>- Viability - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>I don't think in a truly competitive environment Pendulum could ever be terribly viable, especially with the open decklists now; however, the list can take wins against complacent opponents. Furthermore, Pendulum Call and Sky Iris will protect our scales and the non-Magician engines don't actually need to Pendulum Summon at all to be effective, they just need to be on field.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Your standard play with Darkwurm/Gate Magician will just exactly copy the TCG counterpart. Scale Gate Magician and then scale Gate Zero. When you Pendulum Summon, search the Trap. Alternatively, if you already opened Gate Magician, then just scale a Gate. Use Gate Magician's effect in hand by sending Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon to the GY and summon it for essentially free then search the Trap. The Fusion Materials for the traps include the Pendulum Magicians whose names are always treated as those cards so you can deck thin and/or have alternatives if you value the Main Deck targets more than the Extra Deck targets or vice versa. And yes, <strong>Supreme King Gate Magician</strong> is a ""Supreme King,"" ""Supreme King Gate,"" and a ""Magician"" Pendulum Monster. The Trap allows us to summon <strong>Odd-Eyes Arcray</strong> <strong>Dragon </strong>who is our stand-in for Z-ARC. As its name is always treated as Z-ARC, we can use it for all relevant effects but due to this as well, it means we can play it as an Unbound card under the Trinity ruleset.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">My Pendulum decks usually aim to be flashy but as we're playing a midrange deck with very minimal Normal Monsters, the flashiest plays we can do are regulated to the following:</p><ul><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver: </strong>Bait the last attack, prevent the destruction, the have 2 monsters towards <strong>Exceed the Pendulum</strong> or start your turn with a Fusion Summon of <strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong>.</li><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Supreme King Dragon</strong> <strong>Lightwurm: Chronograph Sorcerer</strong>, <strong>Exceed the Pendulum</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes</strong>, and <strong>Wings of Light</strong> (with Z-ARC on Field) all can enable Lightwurm to quick-synchro into cards like <strong>Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing </strong>and <strong>Supreme King Dragon Dark Rebellion</strong>. Or just go into our full roster of Synchro 8s on our own turn.</li></ul><p style=""text-align: left;"">Since the engines are virtually independent and don't rely on much to get going, you can technically get away with running more standard interaction than you might be used to running with a Pendulum deck, just be mindful that your ceiling and protections aren't the greatest depending on circumstances you either make for yourself or are just simply unlucky enough to draw into.</p><hr /><p><strong>45 Card Deck = 3 Points with 3p used.</strong><br />1p Supreme King Gate Magician (Extra Copy)<br />1p Duelist Alliance (Extra Copy)<br />.5p Pendulum Call <br />.5p Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</p><p>Have fun. This engine is honestly really neat and Exceed the Pendulum while being one of the cooler Pendulum Link cards in history, has like... so few practical applications that it makes me excited to see what on-summon Pendulum Monsters we'll be getting in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

With the Legacy support from DUNE and the new tools afforded to us by Angelica's Angelic Ring in AGOV, we can largely say goodbye to Shifter, and hope for greener pastures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whats new?&nbsp;</p><p>- Angelica's Angelic Ring</p><p>Ring is finally here, and gives us a truely worthwhile piece of equipment to grab from grave with Charles' Endphase effect, this protects our board from some of the metagame's most potent boardbreaking spells in DRNM and Superpoly, by negating thier effects at point of resolution. This makes our main endboard significantly more difficult to break.</p><p>-Ra'Ten, The Heavenly General</p><p>Ra'ten alone is a nice piece of extra interaction that we can pick up to go second with, allowing for an extra pop as we enter the battle phase, however, where this card really shines is in games two and three, were we can side into Great Shogun Shien and Eka, the Flame Buddy for matchups like Runick variants, Purrely, and other spell heavy decks, as ending on ra'ten is the key to geting this combo online. It is extremely consistent, with minimal settup and allows us to potentially end the game before the oponent hits their first draw phase.</p><p>-Other new tools I've forgone for this list</p><p>S.P Little Night - without a doubt should be in this list, likely replaceing Ferocious Flame Swordsman, I've chosen to exclude it due to its prohibitively expensive pricetag, currently sitting comfy at $80</p><p>Diabelstar, the Black Witch and accompanying engine - The package of 2-3 wanted, 1 Diabelstar, and 1 Luciela is undoubtedly a great piece of the engine, as acessing a lvl 7 body can be great with otherwise bricky hands for turning ash into a Baronne, however, again due to the price of WANTED being 50 a piece and Diabelstar herself at almost 30, the engine is just prohibitively expenisive compared to the arguably better engine of Kash, which nets a potent, hand neutral distruption, and the potential to make zeus extremely easy off of any normal summonable four plus riseheart.</p><p>Matchups and closing notes -</p><p>Due to extraneous issues, I have not had the time to extensively test into the current Meta decks, including Unchained, Purrely, Labrynth, and Rescue Ace.</p><p>Some other potential inclusions include bystials in the sideboard, as they allow a normal summoned Oliver to make baronne, and are strong into Lab and Tearlament</p><p>In closing, I believe Infernoble can carve out its spot in the meta as a new contender similar, but less powerful than full power superheavy samurai from this past summer, as a deck that combos to high heaven and ends on piles of interactions.</p><p>Hope anyone who desides to go with my list does well with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Due to this, we can play very nicely with a coalition of other Spellcasters and related support to eek out advantage engines outside of just what the normal deck would provide.

That's about it. Since that's the core of our strategy, to supplement it we're going to reduce the floor even further with our various 1 card combos and safe lines of play to back us up.</em><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;- Consistency - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>This strategy is rather consistent as basically any Apprentice + Spell enables Haine with varying degrees of annoyances attached. Since this isn't a purist deck; however, you may be a bit pressed to find interaction outside of Haine and Aruru as we want the majority of our good cards to be Spells that can double as Discard fodder, so, our Traps aren't exactly premium, nor guaranteed to be cycled into (barring Spellbook Tower gamestates). </em><strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>- Sackiness - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong><br /></strong><em>You can run Heavy Storm in this deck in place of Last Will if you'd like to add another sack factor to the deck. Your Cont. Spell/Traps should benefit from the nuke either way in the long term. Regardless, we can't sack very well outside of cards like Ultimate Providence, opening Golem Aruru (not searching it), or opening Unpossessed and even then, the turnover isn't terribly massive and gets diminishing returns the longer the game goes on. Fortunately with Unpossessed face up, attacks aren't encouraged anyway.<br /><br /></em><strong>- Viability - <br /></strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>★</strong><strong>☆</strong><strong>☆</strong><br /><em>Legal Dridents will take you pretty far in Trinity. That said, most of the actual viability in this deck just comes from Aruru gamestates as cards in hand are very hard to deal with in Trinity. Our Extra Deck is loaded with powerful cards to convert the advantages provided from our Tuner roster and since the engine is so elegant and simple, I'd argue if you can concoct a brew that's simplier and even more oppressive, then the viability would skyrocket. Witchcrafters are therefore get 5</em><strong>★</strong><em>s in Versatility.</em><strong><br /></strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Unfair Snowball</strong>: The Snowball provided from the various engines in the deck frankly aren't very fair when it comes to raw numbers advantage. You aren't necessarily seeing fresh cards each time; however, Haine combos being able to set herself up and get her revival are rather obnoxious gamestates to deal with. Every Witchcrafter Spell also recycling itself back to your hand/Field during your EP is extremely strong as well and helps us buffer decision making for Discard effects as we only stand to benefit from it in the end and maintain our generic Spells in hand. Lastly, if we find Spellbook Tower then free draws will take us even further with finding 2 fresh cards per turn and threating a minimum Genni most of the time.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Double Drident</strong>: Borreload Furious Dragon is something we can bring out as a 1 card combo thanks to Odd-Eyes Fusion. We can pretty comfortably destroy Scroll or Bystreet to search it since those cards will come back anyway.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rough Choke Points</strong>: Due to the linearity of the Apprentice's field effects, if you're at all disrupted during the process you go extremely negative, with Called By the Grave being the absolute worst offender and is a psuedo-FTK against you. We have a Garnet in Iris Swordsman and some of the Windwitches when drawn out of order as well but those are things that can be remedied. <br /><br /></li><li><strong>Limited Interaction</strong>: Spell disruption isn't the best. Some things to consider are cards like Forbidden Chalice, Droplet, and Book of Moon/Sol &amp; Luna for things of that avenue but even then, removal tends to be highly favored in comparison, especially for a deck like this that has to bait around Aruru or Discard for Haine to remove cards effectively.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Stat-Checked</strong>: Without Verre or the Fusion Monster, we get walled pretty hard by anything 2900 or greater, especially when summoned en masse. Under those situations we'll just have to do some juggling with Bystreet to protect our Haine as we slowly disect the board.</li></ul><p>The mock-up's done. Let's review the basics.</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />This strategy features a few lines that we can access and still put up a reasonable enough threat, even if Haine has bricked us in some cases. </p><ul><li><strong>Haine-Haine: </strong>This is our boss monster at the time of the writing this due to the state of the banlist. Haine's pretty good nonetheless, she redirects all targeting effects to herself, is kinda big, and most importantly, wields a Drident effect for a Spell Discard. We can also send our Witchcrafter Continuous Spells for the cost as well while they're face-up on Field. She'll be trading one Spell each time to out a face-up Card; however, with the Witchcrafter Spells returning to us during EP, this is ultimately a non-issue. Even against the most cautious of players, this will always trade 1f1 in the short term and be a net +1 in the long term. If you're wondering about Eda, that Monster can grab us <strong>Witchcrafter Pittore</strong> who doubles as our stand-in for any 1500 DEF Spellcaster synergies.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Odd Inclusion of a Fusion:</strong> Borreload Furious Dragon can be summoned by the effect of <strong>Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> by sending Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon and Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overload to the GY directly from our ED. Since all of our Apprentices enable Haine, we can just start with this and beam out Furious immediately (assuming the conditions are met) then play our turn as normal. If done while under the protection of <strong>Witchcrafter Bystreet </strong>(which a Schmietta opener gets us to anyway), then we can safely target any Witchcrafter monster on our side of the field for the effect of Furious Dragon to pop a free card on the opponent's side and keep the monster around. Double this up with Haine and we're getting 2 pops per turn with only 1 requiring use to actually lose a card (and at that point you can just send away the Bystreet as it cannot protect the Haine anymore and you'll just get it back during the next EP anyway!)<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Charmed to Meet You:</strong> Spirit Charmers is still one of the silliest Spellcaster support cards that doesn't see use here despite working wonders for any Albaz deck. Nonetheless, we'll be using it to either setup <strong>Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</strong>, <strong>Unpossessed</strong>, <strong>Teamwork of the Possessed</strong>, or just Familiar-Possessed - Eria. We're only running one main deck Familiar-Possessed monster as they aren't that great and we aren't on their Continuous Spell, so be mindful that you can technically brick on this card if you find Eria first. If you're going to include a 2nd FP name to get around this, I recommend Aussa since it lets us pivot into literally any of our 1500 DEF targets without issue when destroyed under Unpossessed. </li></ul><p>You should be opening any of these general setups with most hands with this deck but even in the event you find yourself with a Haine or Advance Dragon in hand, that's fine as well. You'll just have to pivot for going into turns 3+ for the most effective midgame you might be able to muster until your engine properly comes online.</p><p><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where the deck shines the most really and where the snowball tends to stack up to hilarious levels.</p><ul><li><strong>Windwitchcrafter: </strong>Outside of <strong>Windwitch - Glass Bell</strong> being a target for Unpossessed and related cards, we can go into <strong>Windwitch - Winter Bell</strong> by finding Glass or <strong>Windwitch - Ice</strong> <strong>Bell</strong>. Winter Bell will allow us to summon out Haine and any Apprentice in our hand for free during either player's battle phase simply by targeting itself. If that isn't needed, then we'll just pivot with <strong>Windwitch - Freeze Bell</strong> to summon <strong>Cyber Slash Harpy Lady</strong> and make her completely Battle Immune. Since we're cycling reliable Spells at the minimum, we'll be able to bounce something back on our own turns. Anything gained beyond that is honestly a given since this is still just going to remain on the field and demand removal answers. Lastly, if we find ourself not wanting to perform Windwitch lines or drawing them out of order somehow, we can just send them to the GY for the Summoning Condition of <strong>Awakening of the Possessed - Rasenryu</strong> and bounce back an opponent's card. Once we get rid of Rasenryu, we'll be able to grab any of our ""Possessed"" Spell/Traps right after, making this conversion pivot into all of our engines in the deck.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Advancing the Gamestate: </strong><strong>Odd-Eyes Advance Dragon</strong> is our secondary target for Sky Iris' searching capabilities and can be Tribute Summoned by Tributing over Haine, Borreload Furious Dragon, Iris, etc. Since all of the monsters we play (besides the Magistus Extra Deck) should be assumed to have been summoned correctly, we can not only destroy and burn the opponent down, but also attack something with this 3k body and resummon most of our ED boss monsters or just Haine back with its revival effect. This is a very potent swing and represents a really large swing in LP as well.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Spell ""Book"": </strong>The Spellbook engine in this deck is very lite solely for the purposes of just cycling with Grand Spellbook Tower and/or having a way to Genni when the opponent is ultimately frustrated with the advantages provided by the Field Spell. It's worth mentioning that since our count of the spells isn't actually that high, any additional times we see the Spellbook spells will be random chance after bottom decking the Spell then shuffling via any search or deck summon effect. </li></ul><p>The games may be drawn out and honestly the next section doesn't necesarily mean that you have to be a in deep grind game to take advantage of the following lines of play, just that they're good for closers if you haven't already won.</p><p><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mathematical: </strong>Zoroa, Ecclesia, Golden Swordsoul, and Glass Bell all allow us to access Synchros in this deck pretty comfortably. Being Level 4 Tuners enables us to just go into <strong>Geomathmech Magna</strong> and steal games with the insanity of its tempo swing. This card is extremely underrated and really potent just as an equalizer or way to clear 3 Monsters with one attack.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Arude Introduction: </strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru will win you games more than anything with an extremely lazy amount of effort required. Find this card and beat your opponent up with it. It's fine to even waste your Apprentices to summon this out during the opponent's MP1/2 if it means adding it to your hand during your upcoming SP. This card is really strong on its own.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>The Power of Reliability: </strong>The Continuous Trap <strong>Witchcrafter Patronous </strong>is unmatched when it comes to grind game conversions (though it itself can run out of targets in the long game which is a bit funny to consider). It is our primary way of recycling our banished Apprentices or any instances of Haine being hit by Bottomless, Dinomischus, etc. When it's sent to the GY either due to the opponent, Schmietta, or our <strong>Magicians' Souls&nbsp; </strong>(who can also send away our Field Spells and/or Scroll/Bystreet), we can cycle back any banished Spells that we might've used for <strong>Witchcrafter Genni</strong>'s duplication ability. It's for this reason that if you find yourself opening Patronous or a way to it, you're incentivized to be greedy with Genni if it means you'll snowball sooner.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />As you can tell from the guide the engines all talk to each other very well and operate on a level that's pretty silly when put into practice. Witchcrafter in Highlander will always run into the issue of the Spells doing virtually nothing (besides Scroll) without any of their archetypal monsters in play, but such is the sacrifices you make to try and put such strategies in the spotlight. Regardless, here's a few things to consider when coming up with your own brew!<br /><br />Viability Boosters: <em>Runick | Dragonmaid &amp; Dragon Ruler | more Spellbook | Majespecter Spell/Traps</em><em> | Albaz Support | Crossout Designator &amp; all silver bullets<br /></em><br />General Purpose:<em> Chaos Creator, Magistus &amp; Performages, Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Xeno Meteorus, Loop of Destruction, Super Team Buddy Force Unite!, Duality<br /></em></p><p>Legal Dridents will always be somewhat relevant and give the weaker archetypes of Trinity a leg to stand on, especially when they're as consistent to access as Haine or Moerk. The most important thing is to play into your deck's strengths and be sure to have a back-up plan in mind for one things go awry.</p><hr /><p><strong>50 Card Deck = 4 Points with 4p used.</strong><br />1p Witchcrafter Schmietta (Extra Copy)<br />1p Witchcrafter Patronous (Extra Copy)<br />1p Witchcrafter Golem Aruru<br />.5p Terraforming<br />.5p Last Will</p><p>Thanks for checking out my iteration of the Witchcrafter Starter for Trinity Format. In the event that Diabellestar winds up getting some cards back for us, then you might want to consider adding those cards in to make Haine even more oppressive. Nonetheless, good luck and take care.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

When you have two more monsters excluding Chaos Emperor, play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Ancient to change the level of your monsters to 7.</p><p>4) XYZ Summon Arise-Heart and place ""Xyz Territory"" on Field Zone.

Having ""Banisher of the Light"" present and playing either ""Extra Gate"" or ""Cost Down"" to discard Necroface into BZ also accomplishes the same thing. You can remove ""Xyz Territory"" + ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" + ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" + ""Monster Reborn"" and give it a shot. Everything will remain the same as before.</li></ul><p>6) To deck out your opponent for good measure, set ""Primal Seed"" + ""Card Destruction"" + ""Contract with the Void"".

Considered running 3 Renaud but decided to run 1 and just add 2 Heritage of the Chalice, since that's basically the same thing but gives you more options. Perhaps the correct choice is x2 Renaud x1 Chalice so you have a second Renaud for long, drawn-out games, but idk.

Before Vala, the gameplan was to get Boss Stage on the field afap, so you wanted the deck no bigger than the minimum, but with Vala that becomes the alternative. Now you can play proactively as well as reactively. After all, you can't Xyz Laevatein on your opponent's turn. I needed more level 9s to not brick on Vala, but the rest of the deck was too crucial to give up, so I slapped in two more. </span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The deck doesn't technically need 3 Mardels, but I'm not putting in another Utgarda or a third of any other. And this way, you can combo off faster. Previously, I also ran 2 Hela, but she only pluses when you have tokens on the field. She is just here as another target. Same with Dovelgus, though he's already helped me out a lot.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">With Boss Quest, you might be tempted to grab Stage and Room, but if you know your opponent is running a lot of removal, better grab that Fight instead for a backup Stage. You only really want to use Room's effect on a turn you Droll &amp; Lock. Mardark is a level 9 that Theurlogical Demiurgy can summon. It debuffs enemy monsters, and recycles a Generaider for you to recycle Vala. It's also a wind monster for Link God Dragon. Condemned Witch nets you a Forbidden spell and summons Loptr on opponent's turn (this is not a combo I discovered). I pulled 1 Droplet from my Rise of the Duelist box and got the Chalice in a structure deck, and I am not about to buy more. 1 searchable copy of each fills this deck's needs anyway. Trias Hierarchia is a quick effect you want to use the tokens for. Kuji-Kiri Curse lets you use any level 9 from your hand or field, which can free up space to proc Vala for a new turn.</span></p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-8bc0e434-7fff-73c4-6cbf-0998503036c9""></span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Now, I know I've said before that I don't like running handtraps in a deck if I can fill that space with engines instead, so some of you might be thinking, ""Hey Flooffy, why do you have Droll &amp; Lock Bird here?"" Well that's because unlike almost any other deck, Generaiders can choose when the Droll &amp; Lock activates. Instead of letting your opponent plus from all those draw 1 Generaider effects (something you only want them to do if you are playing a draw burn deck, like the casual Trickstar Generaider deck I concocted, which makes Frodi usable and I will post if anyone shows interest), they get stopped at +1 and won't get to search anything either. It also essentially turns Boss Room's effect into ""negate that effect"". Just remember you can't proc Jormungandr or Mardel after you do that.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Trickstars Foxglove Witch and Divaridis are remnants from that Trickstar Generaider deck because Foxglove is the only one that can be linked using generic Fairies (Loptr, Condemned Witch, Vala), and she summons Divaridis on death. I would save this for when you can end your opponent with the burn damage and their board is too pesky to attack or play through otherwise. The rest of the extra deck is filled with Xyz and link monsters you can summon, with plenty of big beatsticks for those obnoxious monsters unaffected by effects.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The side deck is full of alternative cards I mostly don't have, which all revolve around Mereologic Aggregator. He's a rank 9 that sends an extra deck monster to the gy on summon. The other cards in there do something if sent to the gy. N'tss: Target &amp; destroy 1 card; Malong: Target &amp; return 1 opponent's face-up card to the hand; Garura: Draw 1; Camellia (not yet released): Target 1 opponent's monster, ss her to their field, send targeted monster to gy, get control of her in end phase (says ""must first be link summoned"", don't know if that applies to summoning on your opponent's field, and switching control is not summoning); Kaleido-Heart: Ss her, then target and shuffle 1 opponent's card (I actually pulled one from a blister at Walmart, so I'm really excited to use her). You could just play it safe and only run monsters you can summon naturally by bumping up Aggregator to 2, using him to proc his own gy effect faster.</span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">If there's one card you can cut from this deck, it's Boss Room.

If you have XYZ Summoned Number 13, send it as Tribute for Cusillu. Otherwise, use Number 13 as Link material for Saryuja.</p><p>2) Revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"" and overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"". Then, activate Swirl when you also have Ghost to Fusion Summon Oracle King by using Swirl + Ghost as Fusion materials.</p><p>3) Play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; Destructive Draw"" combo. Then, destroy ""Destructive Draw"" with Ravenous to inflict 3000 damage to yourself...</p><ul><li>Or, is it? When Oracle King is around, you can convert 3000 damage into healing.

Under no circumstance, don't banish either Formula or Ancient as LIGHT target for Chaos Emperor but you can banish any DARK target.</p><p>2) Link Summon Reprodocus and revive 2 x Formula with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, play ""Temple of the Kings &gt;&gt;&gt; DNA Surgery"" combo to change the type of all monsters on the battlefield to <strong>Beast.</strong> This step is a must to XYZ Summon Melffy and its attachment ability.

With Xiangsheng, you can change the Rank of Melffy to 7 by targeting Ancient and Melffy.</p><p>5) Activate Reprodocus to change the attribute of Melffy to ""LIGHT"". Next, activate ""Clockwork Night"" to overwrite the type of all monsters on the battlefield to&nbsp;<strong>Machine.&nbsp;</strong>(Big thanks to Triki for type change tactics)</p><p>6) From Rank 2 EARTH Beast to Rank 7 LIGHT Machine, you can lead the way to C9.

However, P.U.N.K. will always be great with Therions ever since the release of Diabolantis cranking the deck up to 11. So, I sat down and thought to myself, ""Por que no los dos?""</p><p>Thus, Therion Horus P.U.N.K. was born! Utilizing the pitch effect that Imsety and King's Sarc have on top of the the P.U.N.K. engine to going into Diabolantis, send Lily, then reviving Rising Carp or Foxy Tune to go into the typical plays. What really draws me to this list, however, is the consistency and the wealth of plays. What this deck is capable of is awesome.</p><p>Now, does it get clapped by Nib? It honestly depends. There are hands that can, but there are also hands that give you a King before your 5th summon with extensions. Not super common, but it ain't once in a blue moon.</p><p>The only ""problem child"" card I can think of is Dark Ruler, which sucks if you go first, but the deck has ways to break boards going second, so it's all good. Winnig or losing the dice roll kind of determines which Xyz monster you go into.</p><p>Also, whenever I get the whole list in paper, I want to make a video discussing the list and going over some combos for it. For now, enjoy it here and please use it for reference, if you'd like!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

For one, it is a Level 5 Fusion Monster which means that you can use&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>&nbsp;to get it out of the Extra Deck, and in doing so, you can Special Summon a Flip Monster from the Deck in face-down Defense Position. That could've been all that was written on the card, but it has another effect which allows you to banish 2 Flip Monsters from GY and/or face-up field to Special Summon it from GY in face-down Defense Position. And to make things even better, it's first effect to Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down activates on Fusion Summon or when it flips face-up which means that you can just do it again on a future turn. Master of Ham fixes one of the key issues within Prediction Princess which is your inability to easily access&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Your previously most consistent options were&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. If we utilize&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong>&nbsp;to search&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion&nbsp;</strong>from the Deck, we will be able to have access to&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>&nbsp;getting&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>&nbsp;from Deck while also giving you enough material on field to either end on an&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>&nbsp;or even a 3 material&nbsp;<strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Main Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>. I will usually recommend playing 4 or 5 Prediction Princes Ritual Monsters, being a combination of some number of each. Tarotreith can be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's End Phase effect. On flip, it can Special Summon a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and it can Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters either face-up or face-down. Imagine this card as Tarotrei who can flip multiple monsters at a time which means that you can definitely start with this card instead of Tarotrei and get access to Tarotrei later in your combo during your Turn to have her on field. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster either face-up or face-down and she can also Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY in face-down Defense Position during the End Phase. 3&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Bibliomuse gives targeting and destruction protection to all of your Ritual Monsters. On flip, it searches a Prediction Princess monster and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand, and if it is Tributed and sent to GY, you can Special Summon it back face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong>&nbsp;which negates the activated effects of all face-up monsters your opponent field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed, you can add a monster with a different type and attribute from it from your Deck to your hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</strong>&nbsp;which searches a Generaider card or a Plant monster from your Deck to your hand on Summon. Mardel is here as a Level 9 target for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>&nbsp;to target on field or to to Summon from Deck using it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong>&nbsp;which can Tribute a Plant to Summon a Plant from Deck. This basically acts as 2 extra copies of Ophrys Scorpio and it can also Summon Mardel from Deck which gives you a Level 9 target on field for Monstrosity. 3&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>&nbsp;and 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong>. Scorpio can send a monster from hand to GY on Normal or Special Summon to Special Summon a Predaplant monster from Deck. If Cobra is Special Summoned by the effect of a Predaplant monster, it can add a Poly or a Fusion Spell from Deck to hand. Scorpio Summons Cobra from Deck and Cobra searches&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>&nbsp;which gets you&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. But something that is even better is the fact that Scorpio and Cobra will remain on field. This gives you 2 material worth of Link Material or they can act as 2 Level 3 monsters for a&nbsp;<strong>Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</strong>&nbsp;which can insulate you against a handtrap monster. 3<strong>&nbsp;Diviner of the Herald</strong>&nbsp;which sends a Fairy from Deck or Extra Deck to the GY on Normal or Special Summon and gains Levels equal to the sent monster's Level. This sends&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light&nbsp;</strong>from Extra Deck for a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell search. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong>&nbsp;which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can also banish it during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>&nbsp;which can Special Summon a Level 9 monster form hand or target a Level 9 monster on field and Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters with a different type and attribute from Deck. This can get you material for a Rank 9 out onto the field for something like a&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>&nbsp;if you still need to search for Ritual cards, but it can also get you Bibliomuse out onto the field and into rotation in case you did not have access to&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong>&nbsp;which Special Summons a Level 5 or lower Fusion from Extra Deck which is treated as a Fusion Summon. This gets you&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>&nbsp;which is what you really want in this Deck. 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity&nbsp;</strong>and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>&nbsp;which is just so good for reasons I've already stated. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>&nbsp;which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck when it is sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>&nbsp;which can detach any number of materials to destroy an equal number of cards on field and it can also attach any monster it destroys by battle to itself as Xyz Material which makes it great for board clearing and making Zeus. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>&nbsp;which sends a monster from Extra Deck to GY on Xyz Summon which can be Herald for a Ritual Search and it can detach any number of materials to attach the same number of monsters from GY to it as material which can loop Herald for Ritual searches if needed. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong>&nbsp;and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>&nbsp;as a Rank 9 you can go into for interruption. 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</strong>&nbsp;which can replace your opponent's activated monster effect with ""each players draw a card"" which can fade a monster handtrap for protection or you can also just use it as interruption also. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Sky Striker Ace - Camellia</strong>&nbsp;which can Summon itself to your opponent's field and send a monster your opponent controls to GY if it is sent to GY. You don't really need this card, but it turns Masquerena's Link Summon effect into a lot more interruption, and it is even generic. 1&nbsp;<strong>Cross-Sheep</strong>&nbsp;which we are usually going to use either its Fusion or Ritual effect. If a monster is Special Summoned to a zone it points to, if it points to a Fusion, it can Summon back a Level 4 or lower monster from GY or draw 2 cards and discard 2 cards in the case of pointing to a Ritual. You can make this card with Scorpio and Cobra, Instant Fusion Master of Ham to a zone it points to, trigger Cross-Sheep to bring back either Scorpio or Cobra, giving you your Bibliomuse access as well as material for a 3 material Apollousa for 3 monster negates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>.</span></p>"

A Very fun deck with decently consistant starters and a spicy extra deck :),"<p>This is mainly based off of the cards that I own irl and what I enjoy using. It is still a pretty decent deck, but obviously there are better/more expensive cards that you could implement. It also goes without saying that Blue-Eyes is bricky and pretty unreliable... But thats not why we play it, it's about falling in style!</p><p>The OG Ultimate dragon is just there as I bought a JUMP secret rare for nostaglia and also so I can summon him for an epic anime moment, lol.</p><p>Dragon Shrine to send a vanilla Blue-Eyes and Abyss for the double search is amazing to get Chaos Form and Chaos Max for that spicy summon on your next turn.</p><p>Feather Duster is there as I have no back row destruction.</p><p>You can also throw a Called By in for the second Jet Dragon if you wish, or a 3rd Melody for one of the Dragon Shrines.</p><p>As stated in the title, Maxx C is only in here as I have been playing this predominantly on Master Duel, but irl I would use Ash.</p><p>I'd be happy if even 1 person appreciates this deck list :)</p><p>Good day!</p>"

Can get to Master 1 and Duelist Cup Level 20!","<p><em>Dragon, dragon, rock the dragon! Dragon Link Z! </em></p><p>Dragon Link is a deck near and dear to my heart ever since I picked it up a few months ago. The lengthy combos and relatively expressive deckbuilding enable a lot of fun to be had for me, and it can play against just about every deck in the format (with caveats). It's in contention for one of the best decks in the format, I'd argue it's better than Kashtira by virtue of consistency (even this 60 card brew I found bricks less than Kashtira) and is at least competitive with Purrely and Labrynth, and will remain as a powerful option going forward for some time. Without any further ado, here's the card by card and why I chose things.</p><h2>Main Deck Dragon Link (Rokket, Chaos Dragons, and Seyfert)</h2><ul><li>3x Rokket Tracer. The lifeblood of our deck, not our best normal but a card we would absolutely love to see in our opening hand regardless. With Striker Dragon, you can 1 card combo into Chaos Ruler (or any other DARK level 8 Synchro) using this card.</li><li>2x Rokket Recharger. We need something to summon off Tracer's effect, and Recharger is basically the best option. I run two to avoid situations where I draw Recharger and can't use Tracer's effect to summon anything.</li><li>1x Absorouter Dragon. Send this to the grave to search a Rokket (usually Tracer). Especially nice when paired with Chaos Space or Dragon Ravine, to make the cost of those cards completely beneficial.</li><li>1x Noctovision Dragon. Extender, gives you a draw when used as Link material. Don't run more than 1, as it is a brick on its own, but it's good enough to have 1 copy.</li><li>1x Boot Sector Launch. Field Spell to SS up to two Rokkets with different names straight from hand, searchable by our Link-1? Amazing. This enables Rokket Tracer to do some silly things by summoning it from hand and then being the target to blow up for its effect.</li><li>3x Quick Launch. Extension, a starter, a way to play around Maxx C a little, it's another card we cannot go without. Amazing.</li><li>3x Starliege Seyfert. Fill up the graveyard <em>and</em> search a Dragon of the same level as the ones you discarded? Don't mind if I do. Generally, we send a Level 4 (preferably something in hand, but Seyfert works in a pinch) to search out one of the two Level 4 Chaos Dragons in order to have comfortable plays. Seyfert represents our only outright one card combo into Borrelend, so we absolutely have to run three copies. Also lets you retrieve a Level 8 LIGHT/DARK Dragon from grave and add it to hand.</li><li>3x White Dragon Wyverburster. Banish a DARK from grave to summon this. After that, you Link (or Synchro) it off to search...</li><li>2x Black Dragon Collapserpent. Banish a LIGHT from grave to summon this. We run fewer since most of our deck is DARK and it can occasionally be a brick to open with.</li><li>1x Chaos Dragon Levianeer. One of our high roll big boys. Banish all DARKs to handrip, Banish LIGHTs and DARKs to destroy up to two cards on field (good for board breaking and getting ready for a turn 3 OTK), Banish all LIGHTs to Monster Reborn (we rarely use this due to lack of LIGHTs in deck and the low impactness of it, but it can be useful on occasion).</li><li>3x Chaos Space. We play a lot of LIGHT/DARK monsters that can't be normalled, so of course we run this. Ideally we'd discard Saronir/Absorouter to search our Wyverburst, but use your judgement to decide what should be sent for its effect. The grave effect to draw is also really useful, since it represents both recovery and resource accumulation.</li></ul><h2>Bystials (or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the Branded Beast)</h2><ul><li>1x Bystial Lubellion. Searches a Bystial of choice, can summon itself from grave by tributing a Level 6+ DARK Dragon, and can then put a Branded Continuous Spell/Trap straight from deck onto the field face-up. The exact number of copies is a bit flexible, I run 1 due to economics (UR dust typically being spent on new decks and new cards rather than extra copies) but more copies are certainly nice to have.</li><li>1x Bystial Magnamhut. Probably what you're searching with Lubellion, though the choice is going to be dependent on board state. It searches a Dragon in the end phase after summoning, and it means <em>any</em> Dragon. Generally, when you're going first you'll be searching another Bystial in the end phase (Druiswurm or Baldrake, probably). I'd run at least two copies if it weren't limited, but alas I don't control the banlist.</li><li>1x Bystial Druiswurm. Our boardbreaking Bystial, this one often forces immediate attention from the opponent due to its effect when sent from field to grave. I'd probably run a second copy over Baldrake if this wasn't limited, but YMMV on that front.</li><li>1x Bystial Baldrake. Theoretically a really nasty monster that can supremely ruin your opponent's day, but it's just ever-so-slightly too specific with its requirements to consistently be a nuisance. Still good, though, and it's more importantly a Bystial (meaning it can do the anti-LIGHT/DARK banish, making Tear players miserable and Mathmech players seethe).</li><li>2x Bystial Saronir. Send this to the grave, send another Bystial/Branded card to the grave. I usually send Lubellion, unless I already have Lubellion in the grave or a way to get it into rotation (in which case I send Branded Regained).</li><li>1x Branded Regained. Gives you both what's basically Chaos Space's GY effect every turn and revives a Bystial from grave when your opponent summons a monster.</li><li>1x Branded Beast. A pop to any card on the field, provided you control a Bystial and have a Dragon to tribute. Also grabs a Branded Continuous Spell/Trap from GY and puts it back on the field in the end phase, allowing you to get Regained on the field alongside it. This and Regained represent a pretty nasty control engine, allowing grind games to be extremely smooth, while allowing you to also break boards with Beast's effect.</li></ul><h2>Other Main Deck Dragon Engine (Dragonmaid, Red-Eyes, Dragon Ravine)</h2><ul><li>3x Chamber Dragonmaid. Another one card combo into Romulus, a searcher for the extremely good Dragonmaid Tidying (excellent disruption on your opponent's turn), and a Level 4 to Synchro with Tracer (or the Bystials for Chaos Angel, more on that later). Just an all-around good card for Dragon Link and the 60 card variants get to use this well since we have a lot more space for this kind of thing than 40 card variants.</li><li>1x Dragonmaid Hospitality. Our revive for Chamber, part of the aformentioned one card combo. NS Chamber, search this, Link into Striker, use Hospitality to revive Chamber, link both her and Striker for Romulus.</li><li>1x Dragonmaid Tidying. Bounce both a Dragon you control and a card on your opponent's field or GY. Just solid disruption that gets around destruction protection and can then be used to summon Chamber from hand/GY on the next turn.</li><li>1x Black Metal Dragon. One for One target, and also an NS that can net you Romulus with no further investment (beyond banishing Striker Dragon).</li><li>1x Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Banish a Dragon on field to summon this, then you can use it to summon a Dragon from your hand/GY. Allows a lot of stuff and enables some truly wacky high roll plays, but is a brick on its own.</li><li>1x One for One. Technically non-engine, but since we're only using it to summon Black Metal it may as well just be put here.</li><li>1x Dragon Ravine. Searchable via Romulus, allows us to Foolish Burial any Dragon for the cost of a discard.</li></ul><h2>Non-Engine (Handtraps, anti-Handtraps, and Thrust targets)</h2><ul><li>3x Ash Blossom, 3x Maxx C, 2x Called By the Grave. It's Master Duel, we have to be prepared for anything and Ash+Called By is basically that. Maxx C is also there, for obvious reasons. I'd run like eight copies of Called By if I could (not actually that many, but you get the idea), we suffer whenever any of the big three blowout handtraps resolve (Maxx C, Droll &amp; Lock Bird, and Dimensional Shifter) and it counters all of them.</li><li>1x Crossout Designator to stop other handtraps. Most importantly, Nibiru can screw us if we don't have a particularly good hand (as we have very few combo lines to play under the threat of Nibiru), and Designator is the best counter to it.</li><li>1x Nibiru. Ruins other combo decks' day, we need a copy for Crossout Designator, and being a LIGHT means it can be grabbed off Chaos Ruler and banished by the Chaos monsters to summon them.</li><li>3x Triple Tactics Thrust. Searches any Normal Spell/Trap if your opponent activates a monster effect, though you can only add it to your hand (instead of setting it for next turn) if your opponent controls a monster. This card made a big splash on release in the OCG, and of course it's extremely good here where we need tools for basically every situation.</li><li>1x Herald of the Abyss. Anti-Purrely and Kashtira measures, and our solution to Towers-type monsters in general.</li><li>1x Harpie's Feather Duster. Anti-backrow. We do have a fair amount of backrow hate (Branded Beast, Chaos Angel, Tidying, Levianeer), but it requires set up we often don't have the luxury of doing against backrow decks so Duster solves that.</li><li>1x That Grass Looks Greener. It's a 60 card deck, of course we run Grass. That juicy, juicy mill 20 is too much to pass up.</li><li>1x Triple Tactics Talent. Versatile card, can unbrick you if you get Ashed, steal a key monster to force interaction or allow you to break boards, or let you look at your opponent's hand and rip a card out of it.</li><li>1x Evenly Matched. While not quite as potent as it was previously due to Kashtira and Purrely having extremely potent single boss monsters, Evenly is still a phenomenal boardbreaker.</li><li>2x Infinite Impermanence. It negates a monster on-field and can be used from hand. Good for both stopping your opponent from building a board and for boardbreaking.</li></ul><h2>Extra Deck (it's just the whole Extra)</h2><ul><li>2x Striker Dragon. Searches Boot Sector Launch, can grab a Rokket from grave if need be, and the Link arrow is useful for...</li><li>1x Guardragon Pisty. The only Guardragon Link to not be banned, and still extremely good. If two Link monsters have arrows pointing to a monster zone, you can summon any Dragon from your GY or banished cards to that zone. Just note you cannot summon anything but Dragons while Pisty is on the field.</li><li>1x Dragunity Knight - Romulus. Searches Dragon Ravine, and that's often it. Its second effect to summon a Dragon from hand can be useful, but only in certain scenarios where you can get into a Synchro without screwing up your combo.</li><li>1x Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres. It's an FTK. Jokes aside, it's basically our best option when put under Maxx C and makes Nibiru hurt less if we're hit by it. Tribute it to bounce an opponent's card, then summon Druiswurm/Magnamhut depending on the situation.</li><li>1x Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy. In situations where you're DARK-locked by Rokket Tracer, this is the best DARK Link-2 to make. It's rare you'll actually summon anything off his effect, but it can occasionally come in handy.</li><li>1x Triple Burst Dragon. To set up Pisty's effect, and also equip to Borreload Savage Dragon.</li><li>1x Knightmare Unicorn. For situations where you need something off the field and can go into it. Entirely replacable if desired.</li><li>1x Accesscode Talker. OTK push tool if needed, entirely replaceable.</li><li>1x Borrelend Dragon. Our big boss, the goal of our combos, the thing we strive to make every turn. Can't be destroyed, attack all monsters on the field once, negate a monster on the field permanently and revive a Rokket from the grave. This card is absurd, and you should always strive to get into it if possible.</li><li>1x Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy. Replacable if desired, but we can sometimes make a Rank 8 and it's either this or The Zombie Vampire, and I prefer shoring up my endboards via this guy.</li><li>1x Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Magical Dragon. Shockingly, this card isn't banned. And thank goodness, because it's a phenomenal card for this. It allows us to try and fix an otherwise really bad hand, and allows us to high-roll into some stupid stuff. Also revives itself by banishing a LIGHT and a DARK, which can be useful for Link material.</li><li>1x Borreload Savage Dragon. Omni-negate on a Synchro we can easily make, provided we have a Link in grave to equip. Can also beat over a lot of monsters thanks to it gaining half the Attack of the equipped Link monster.</li><li>1x Baronne de Fleur. Due to being WIND and us frequently DARK-locking ourselves, we rarely summon it, but Rokket Tracer+a Bystial can make this easily.</li><li>1x Chaos Angel. Doesn't even need a tuner and can become a Towers if you use a LIGHT. More importantly, just banishes a card from the field without any cost on summon, making it great for cracking boards. A Bystial+any Level 4 in the deck gets us this.</li></ul><h2>Future Cards</h2><ul><li>Bystial Dis Pater is a great Level 10 Synchro that provides extension, interaction, and recovery. Most brews I've seen post CYAC run this in the OCG/TCG, and we'll be running it the moment it comes out in MD since we can easily make it.</li><li>S:P Little Knight. A stupidly good staple ED monster, though it being Link-2 (with very poor Link arrows) does mean this deck doesn't quite use it as well as it'd like. Still worth looking into.</li><li>Etude of the Branded. We often summon back Rokket Tracer with Borrelend, we frequently have Bystials on field, we aren't usually DARK-locked on our opponent's turn, Etude allows a quick Synchro on either turn to summon whatever you desire. It's also a Macro Cosmos for monsters used as material for Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Link monsters, which is situationally useful. It might be worth looking into, but probably not something to main deck.</li><li>The Bystial Aluber. Is very bad. Bafflingly bad, and I would not recommend running it for any reason.</li></ul>"

Start by playing ""The Humble Sentry"" to shuffle other Chaos Emperor into your deck and then, play ""Magical Contract Door"" to tutor Chaos Emperor and give your opponent any spell but combo pieces and Quick-Play spells. You can also give any two of your cards with ""Gold Moon Coin"" to your opponent as well. Anyways, here are these spells in question, of which under any circumstances, you mustn't give them at all:</p><ul><li><strong>Combo:&nbsp;</strong>Primal Seed + The Humble Sentry + Magical Contract Door</li><li><strong>Quick-Play:&nbsp;</strong>Reload + Pot of Acquisitiveness</li></ul><p>3) When you think it's enough, destroy ME-PSY-YA with Ravenous. Then, set all traps and end your turn. This step is a must because we have given lots of spells to the opponent and ""Magical Thorn"" deals damage if they were sent to GY, not BZ.</p><p>4) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate ""Present Card"" first and follow-up with ""Magical Thorn"" cards for the FTK.

Tribute Summon granted from ""Card Advance"" will be used for Cusillu and Normal Summon granted from ""Double Summon"" will be used for ""Vampire Lady"".</p><p>2) When you have Special Summoned Linewalker, you can Tribute Summon Cusillu to set your opponent's LP to 3000. If you have Number 13 present on the battlefield, use it as tribute.</p><p>3) Special Summon Obelisk via Saryuja. Then, Normal Summon ""Vampire Lady"". Finally, revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"" and overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"".</p><p>4) Activate ""Temple of the Kings"" and set ""Vampire Domination"". You can end your turn but not before changing the button on the lower right corner of the screen to either ""ON"" or ""Auto"" to not miss anything. It can be changed within settings under ""Duel"", where you can change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch + Hold"" for manual setup.</p><p>5) A pop-up screen will appear. There, activate Obelisk and then, chain into ""Vampire Domination"". With Obelisk being negated and destroyed, you can gain LP equal to its original ATK, which is 4000. With the healing conversion coming from Number 43 into damage, you can deal 4000 damage for the FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Obelisk the Tormentor"" can be found within ""The Great Olds"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found within ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Vampire Domination"" can be found within ""Immortal Glory"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

It&rsquo;s not good but it is free. Realistically we can use the noble knight dump effect every turn. I&rsquo;ve got 1 or two techs to take advantage of that. Typically though you&rsquo;ll just be dumping an Infernoble Knight Turpin for better recursion. The second effect is not needed or good. But in unique situations you can use it to put out fodder for I;P masquerna. Remember this can trigger the infernoble knight equips when sent to the graveyard. The 9 and 12 effects do happen if the game goes beyond the first turn. This is a rogue deck in modern yugioh so that&rsquo;s very questionable and shouldn&rsquo;t be depended on.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Overall Camelot is one of the best-designed legacy support cards I&rsquo;ve seen so far.

This deck also still gets to use the classic Noble Knight XYZ monsters for removal and combos.</span></p><p class=""MsoSubtitle"">Angelica into double Charlemange</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The basic Infernoble knight combo works like this. Use Infernoble knight Turpin and Oliver to synchro summon into Angelica princess of the noble arms. This can also be done with Ricardetto off of an Isolde Two Tales of the Noble Knights. Angelica is going to let us search Noble Arms Museum. Second, we can attempt to equip an infernoble from graveyard to trigger Angelica&rsquo;s second effect to tag out into Infernoble knight Vanguard Roland and send whatever infernoble knight we don&rsquo;t have in grave yet. For this example, I&rsquo;ll say Magnus.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">From here we play an equip or use an Infernoble Knight from grave as an equip to let us summon back turpin from grave. Then we can synchro summon into Infernoble Knight emperor Charles.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">After equipping another Infernoble Knight from grave to Charles we then link off into Charlemagne and equip Charles from grave. We then play Noble Arms Museum to search any noble arms card. This can be Camelot for extension or it can be an equip spell to trigger the before-mentioned effects. The point is after that we can use noble arm museum to special summon the equipped Charles. Equip something else to Charles and you can make a second Charlemagne.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">That&rsquo;s 2 omninegates and a ton of quick effect removal. More so than that this combo plays into our noble knight plays. It can search Camelot, Isolde sets up the old noble arms in graveyard, and we can set it up with our noble knights.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you sent angelic ring you can re-equip with Charles effect at the end of turn for an extra spell negate. It&rsquo;s a very powerful card.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Oh yeah if you need any other specific infernoble knight combos. Please check out the Combo sheet by djh_dylan and the Campions of Camelot discord which Is the Infernoble Knight + Noble Knight Discord. The discord is also linked in the description.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<strong>Specific Noble Knight combos</strong></p><p class=""MsoSubtitle"">Noble knight medraut + Any infernoble equip spell</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For a specific combo example we can use noble knight medraut plus any infernoble equip spell to create an unhand-trappable starter. Medraut can summon any noble knight monster from our deck then pop an equip spell equipped to him. If we special summon infernoble knight Renauld we can immediately add back the equip spell we popped and then make isolde off of out two monsters and go full infernoble knight combo. If the opponent ash blossom or infinite impermence on medraut we just use the infernoble knight equip and go for fire flint lady or a different infernoble depending on the hand. Thus making Isolde anyway.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoSubtitle"">Camelot + Gawayn</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">A much stronger combo is using Camelot plus noble knight gawayn. Camelot makes it extremely easy to get to Isolde. But if we have gawayn we get to immediately special summon gawayn as well. Of course we can go into isolde here and we should. Isolde lets us then dump 4 equip spells to special summon gigchad. The 4 you dump are destiny, excaliburn, durendal, and almace. Then we can use gigchad&rsquo;s effect to add back to hand gawayn. Trust me you will have an equip live for this. While we could just make appollosa here theres a much better option.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This combo used to only be do-able with with unexpexted dai as a starter. Now it can be a follow up to a medruat or an infernoble knight combo.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoSubtitle"">Noble knight Artorigus as an extender</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can make artorigus to equip 3 of the spells we just sent to graveyard with Isolde. This is a potential plus 2 as we can trigger out infernoble knight spells for searching. While the other equip spells make our xyz into a towers monster in the process. This is the bread and butter of the deck making artorigus while setting up for infernoble knioght plays as a base. And tying this together is the absurd level of graveyard recursion this deck presents.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">These are the basics but there are a few other combos worth considering.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoSubtitle"">The complete board wipe combo</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can use charles&rsquo; effect to pop custenian to immediately go into the rank 5 artigous. It works out as a way to remove 3 cards from the opponent&rsquo;s field and recur value from our equip spells in the game. It&rsquo;s a ridiculously good recursion especially since the rank 5 artiogious also gets recursion when he leaves the field.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<strong>Noble Knight Deck Lists</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Here is my deck list for Infernoble Noble knights.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-align: center;""><span style=""mso-no-proof: yes;"">                    </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This list functions as a Series of two card starters. Medruat plus any equip. Camelot plus gawayn. Gawayn plus any &ldquo;normal&rdquo; noble knight. Any two infernoble knight cards. Plus heritage which can become literally anything. It&rsquo;s absurdly consistent since any two warrior monsters on the field are full combo thanks to Isolde.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Really these card&rsquo;s work in any combination you have options.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">there are a ton of one ofs unfortunately. This deck is very searchable so it works out. Consistency wise some of these one ofs can work as extenders.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I am running barrone plus gearfried to do that extended combo. Gearfried can be sent to graveyard with angelica effect and it can bee added back with Renald or Joyeuse.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This list I&rsquo;m showing here is going to 43 to fit in 9 hand traps. You can&rsquo;t realistically play a deck today without some generic help. The side deck covers what the hand traps don&rsquo;t, and I made sure you&rsquo;ll have room to put them in thanks to the extended deck size.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I built this as a go first list since realistically there&rsquo;s no other options for a weaker deck like this.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I am running one caliburn beacuase it wins games in time. It&rsquo;s not once per turn so you can do some really funny things if need be. Also you don&rsquo;t have to do this but I think it&rsquo;s funny. You can side deck in one last chapter of the noble knights going second to get some relatively okay plan b shenanigans going second. It is searchable and usually live playing into most boards.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">Alright so that&rsquo;s about It for noble knights.

It is 53 cards since one Ze Amin + discard is full PUNK combo, and there are 15 copies of Ze Amin (3 Ze Amin, 3 Ogre, 3 Foxy Tune, 3 Emergency Teleport and 3 Small World) giving the duelist a fair chance of drawing into it with their starting hand. 53 cards also make it less likely that you will hard draw your garnets (Sharakusai, Deer Note, Wa Gon and Jam Session) that are essential for the combo. Trust me, 53 cards is still surprisingly consistent and totally not bricky, especially since you can draw up to 4 cards with the Horus engine!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400;"">The two archetypes in this deck are of course&nbsp;PUNK (16 cards)&nbsp;and Horus (9 cards). PUNK cards are your starters for the main combo while Horus are extenders that enhance your board while obtaining more resources.</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Many staples (19 cards) are included are divided into two catergories - 1. Crossout Designator and it's handtrap targets and #2. Triple Tactics Thrust and it's search targets. Crossout Designator is in the deck to protect your combo against pesky Nibirus, Ashes and Drolls that would otherwise severely limit your plays. Finally, handtraps are also Small World bridges to search Ze Amin (to start your combo) and Horus (Extenders).&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">The strategy of PUNK Horus is to interrupt your opponent as much as possible while building as much resource advantage as you can with multiple draws and searches. The turn after, if your opponent hasn't surrendered yet, both Horus and PUNK have massive follow-up to enable an easy OTK. If King's Sarcophagus is intact until the next turn, your opponent will have to contend with 4 giant beatsticks summoned basically for free! The PUNK cards have follow-up to, since Jam Session and Amazing Dragon is on the field and Dragon Drive is in the GY. Both engines can OTK independently!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The combo for this strategy is the standard PUNK combo -&gt; Horus combo.

With Horus, PUNK's powerlevels have received another boost with all the level 8 bodies it has access to! Drawing 6+ cards and ending on a full PUNK board is a gamestate most duelists would have difficulty dealing with, making PUNK stronger than ever!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><p style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">From my personal experience playing snline and in Locals, it is super fun playing piloting Punk. Playing this deck, it&rsquo;s the greatest feeling having a 6 card hand full of handtraps and follow-up at the end of combo. Even if my board gets cleared, I still fire away hand trap after hand trap to stop my opponent in their tracks! I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, I&rsquo;m taking this deck to Locals again this week, wish me luck!

Totem Five,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with underused card called ""Totem Five"" alongside ""Rekindling"", which unlocks its potential. Let's get into the action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RawVUishFfM"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>- First and foremost, I suggest you to watch the video and strictly follow Extra Deck summon pattern, which is important to use every single one of them such as...</p><ul><li>Cupid to lead the way with Scarlight for potential extra burst coming from either cards.</li><li>Ravenous to discard two FIRE monsters with 200 DEF, which matters a lot for ""Rekindling"".</li><li>Saryuja to Special Summon Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Cannoneer altogether and utilize Cannoneer for ""Rekindling"".</li><li>XYZ Summon Dugares with Monk+Cannoneer as materials and Special Summon Cannoneer via Dugares for another time to use the ability of Cannoneer.</li></ul><p>1) Make sure you plant five roses to opposing side with ""Black Garden"".</p><p>2) While following Extra Deck summon pattern, here is the math behind burn cards:</p><ul><li><strong>Fire Cracker:</strong> 1000 damage (Activate its ability from your hand.)</li><li><strong>Volcanic Scattershot:&nbsp;</strong>2 x 500 = 1000 damage (Discard them via Ravenous/Cannoneer.)</li><li><strong>Laval Magma Cannoneer:&nbsp;</strong>4 x 500 = 2000 damage (Bring forth Cannonneer via Saryuja and Dugares. Then, use its ability twice for each time.)</li><li><strong>Cupid Pitch:&nbsp;</strong>8 x 100 = 800 damage (When you Synchro Summon Scarlight, you will deal damage with respect to level of Scarlight.)</li><li><strong>Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend:&nbsp;</strong>Activate this card to destroy your side of battlefield. For each Effect Monsters destroyed, you will deal multiples of 500. Damage output may vary but on average, try to aim for 1000-2000 mark.)</li><li><strong>Thunder Crash:&nbsp;</strong>Play this card to deal some damage and make preparations for ""Rekindling"" because you need all five free Main Monster Zones (MMZ) for Totem Five to perfectly resolve.</li><li><strong>Totem Five:&nbsp;</strong>5 x 500 = 2500 damage (After ""Rekindling"" has been played, if you have Special Summoned five monsters at once thanks to ""Rekindling"", ""Totem Five"" can destroy everything your opponent has. If you go second and your opponent has full backrow for some reason, the damage output can be doubled.)</li><li><strong>Raypierce/Guerilla:&nbsp;</strong>500 + 500 = 1000 damage (Although not shown in this video, this step is what you should do after ""Rekindling"" has been played and ""Totem Five"" has been perfectly resolved. Use Cracker+Cannoneer as materials for Queen to be placed on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) and bring forth Scarlight, albeit as negated. Then, Special Summon Mars and activate its ability to trigger Raypierce and Guerilla for their damages.)</li><li><strong>The Blazing Mars:&nbsp;</strong>5 x 500 = 2500 damage (Read the part above. You can consider Mars as better variant of ""Thunder Crash"".)</li></ul><p>3) If you did everything right, you can deal up to 13k damage for the FTK. I know that video stops before ""Raypierce/Guerilla"" part explained in #2 since I haven't played all ""Upstart Goblin"" cards but don't forget to use anything beyond ""Raypierce/Guerilla"" part to ensure your victory. Simply put, activate Mars if you must for the absolute victory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""The Blazing Mars"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Rekindling"" can be found either within ""Combatants of Flame"" or ""Justice Before Attribute"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"" can be found within ""Savage Crimson Dragon"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Also, activate ""Abyss Dweller"" because we don't want to be disturbed from GY effects coming from the opponent later on.</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon. This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards. Oh, don't banish Formula as LIGHT target with Chaos Emperor by accident because Formula will be utilized later on.</p><p>3) Special Summon either TLF or Rhodode with Saryuja. Then, banish ""Necroface"" with ""Allure of Darkness"" but in order to do so, your Main Deck should have at least two cards.</p><p>4) Return ""Necroface"" to GY with ""Burial from a Different Dimension"" and send it back to BZ with ""Soul Release"". Repeat this setup until you deck-out your opponent.</p><p>5) Revive discarded cards thanks to Ravenous with ""Monster Reborn"" and Formula. So, your board should consist of ""Chaos Emperor + Formula + TLF + 2 x Rhododes"", if you have done everything correct.</p><p>6) Replace TLF with TLF III and activate III's effect to return your opponent's cards from BZ to GY.</p><p>7) Synchro Summon Ruddy by using Chaos + Formula as materials and activate Ruddy's effect to return your opponent's cards from GY to BZ.</p><p>8) What is going to happen is that Rhodode deals damage with multiples of 200 for each card, if opponent's cards were banished from GY. Mind you, there are two Rhododes. Also, your opponent's first battle/effect damage will be doubled by TLF III. Therefore, your victory is certain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Legendary Fisherman III"" can be found within ""Rulers of the Deep"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ruddy Rose Dragon"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Abyss Dweller"" can be found within ""Forgotten City Dwellers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 510 SR and 210 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

What you do from there is up to you, depending on whatever resources you have left, and you can usually get at least 2 ED summons on the board in one go, including:</p><p>- <strong>Borreload Savage</strong> (typically after Linking up to Rusty Bardiche so Wise Strix is in the GY). Make sure you keep one of your Rokket tuners available.</p><p>- <strong>Rusty Bardiche</strong>, good for getting more Rank-Up-Magic's at your disposal. Alternatively, bust Bardiche before End Phase to attach to Borreload.</p><p>-<strong>Tri-Brigade Shuraig</strong>, very good disruption. The trap still functions after Rank-Up-Magic Force, but if you're lucky you can link straight to him with Wise Strix.</p><p>-<strong>Cyber Dragon Infinity</strong>. This one requires that Wise Strix's effect searches Soul Shave and not RUM Force, AND that neither Strangle Lanius nor Rokket Tracer's effect activated. Also you lose half your LP, but hey, another Omni-Negate!</p><p>-<strong>Time Thief Redoer</strong>. I typically like to Xyz summon using Bardiche so Redoer has both the 'Send to Deck' and 'Banish Himself' effect.</p><p>-<strong>Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</strong>. Gotta love a good Towers monster. Burn damage, ATK reduction, effect activation denial, this baby is the goat. My Royal Finish copy in MD is my pride and joy.</p><p>-And lastly, <strong>Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon</strong>. Because of the field spam and/or ED summons, you can often get this guy to over 10,000 ATK, ON TOP of his target and destruction immunity (which include Raider's Knights effect).</p><p>While you would think the sheer quantity of archetypes would be this deck's detriment, the deck's variety both makes it more adapatable and more interesting to fight with (and possibly also against).</p><p>My only real gripe is the occassional brick (typically by having too many Rokkets in the hand, or being stuck with Tribute Lanius with no recovery), so feel free to tweak it. Also, once again, I refuse to use Ash Blossom and Maxx ""C"" out of principle, we play Yu-Gi-Oh to have fun.</p><p>See y'all when the new RR support gets into Master Duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It's exceptionally rare for the duel to last more than 3 turns, even rarer to lose.<br /><br />Side Deck Options:<br />I typically swap 2 mallets out for an MoF and a Dark hole. MoF is useful if you screw up and discard a Dark Factory or Reincarnation<br /><br />dark hole is good for killing your own sangan/witch if the AI is a defensive character. <br />MoF is a good option to replace Mallets in some situations. </p>"

I mean, it's got 3 Garnets. But it's not useless--oh, NO. Thanks to Imsety, Glory of Horus and King's Sarcophagus, Graveyard-reliant decks have more Graveyard setup, field presence, and access to most Rank 8 Xyz monsters! That means Spell negation, Monster negation, a draw 3, more OTK enablers, a mill-4-and-revive, and even a fair Diablosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I made this Zombie World deck with a full Horus Engine. Imsety and King's Sarc both provide some Graveyard setup--which Zombies in general appreciate--and the Horus monsters can give you some Rank 8 field presence, or some Link monsters. And Canopic Protector can revive Horus monsters when your opponent decides to play the game. And if your opponent gets rid of one of your cards while you control a Horus monster, well...let's just say something interesting will happen. Due to contaning quite a few Level 8 monsters, this deck contains 3 Trade-In. And while the ideal situation is going first, this deck mains 6 hand traps, 2 Forbidden Droplets, and 3 Super Poly, so it can still put up a good fight going second.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I decided to name this deck ""Shibuya Shakedown"", because I had Shibuya, Tokyo on my mind. That ward of Tokyo, Japan is already crowded, but on Halloween, it's a living hell for someone with claustrophobia. In fact, its mayor Ken Hesebe has actually been cracking down on it in 2023, after a Halloween crowd surge in South Korea killed 150 people in 2022. Hesebe has been putting security guards all over Shibuya, banning alcohol sales and public drinking there, and even putting up signs requesting that people not come to Shibuya for Halloween.</p>"

When you have used Aero Shark, destroy it with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive it with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, attach ""Overlay Regen"" to Aero Shark and start shooting again. Finally, destroy Aero Shark with Offerings.</p><p>5) Rinse and repeat what was explained in #4 until opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

This setup is needed to find combo pieces from Banish Zone (BZ) with ""Primal Seed"" cards. Also, don't banish ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" as DARK target for Chaos Emperor by accident because it will be used.</p><p>2) Special Summon ""The Tricky"" with its ability and revive Librarian with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, activate ""Clockwork Night"".</p><p>3) With everything turned into Machine, you can XYZ Summon ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" with Librarian + Tricky as materials and overlay into ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"".</p><p>4) Feed Infinity by attaching a monster which was placed as face-up Attack Position. Defense Position won't work, so be mindful of reviving monsters with ""Monster Reborn"" while feeding. Also, since the attachment ability isn't hard once per turn, you can try again with Book spells.</p><p>5) You should aim for attaching at least 10 materials or more. When you think it's enough, activate ""Barian's Force"" to overlay into ""Number C6"". Then, overlay into ""Number 9"" with ""Astral Force"" and finally C9 with ""Barian's Force"".</p><p>6) Activate both abilities of C9 to FTK your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"" can be found within ""Sword of the Seventh One"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number C6"" can be found within ""Timeworn Legacies"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" can be found within ""Pearlescent Cyber Dragons"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"
