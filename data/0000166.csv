Witch of the Blood Rose is an easy level 7 synchro, by searching for Witch of the Black Rose and putting Rose Fairy to the top of the deck.

Psychopompos and Retort Fusion,"<span>Deck goes first of course. With DAMA coming out in the near future, we get cards that give zombies some new tools and cards that give back power that was lost over the course of time due to the banlist. With the introduction of <strong>Halq</strong>, zombies had a better way of sending<strong> Glow-up Bloom</strong> out of the deck and into the grave, but as <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> was limited, not only did we loose quick tuner access, we also lost a way to ensure that our plays always go through turn 1. <strong>Psychopompos</strong> is a nice alternative to summon off of <strong>Halq</strong> and its unique effect gives it a place in the deck alongside<strong> Jack-o-Bolan</strong> as he helps to banish<strong> pompos</strong>.</span>  <span>Maindeck is 3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 3 <strong>Belle</strong>, 2<strong> Doomking</strong>, 2 <strong>Banshee</strong>, 1<strong> Jack-o-Bolan</strong>, 3 <strong>Solitaire</strong>, 3 <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong>, 2<strong> Mezuki</strong>, 1 <strong>Gozuki</strong>, and 1 <strong>Glow-up Bloom</strong>. And we are also playing only 1 <strong>Psychopompos</strong> since he is a soft garnet in the same way <strong>Bloom</strong> is. You can decide to play <strong>Dangers</strong> or someother kind of free special summon as you want link material for <strong>Halq</strong>,<strong> Sucker</strong>, and <strong>Yuki-Onna</strong> but for this deck, we are getting there via <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> and the 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong>.</span>  <span>Spells/Traps: 3 <strong>Zombie World</strong> which is just an insane floodgate. 3 <strong>Super Poly</strong> which is interruption for turn 2 since this deck cannot break boards that well even with side deck cards and you want to prevent any attempts of your opponent making an interruption. 1 <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for <strong>Millennium-Eyes</strong>. 3 <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> which summons the best monster of 2017 WHICH IS A ZOMBIE BTW. 1 <strong>Foolish</strong>. 3 <strong>Cyclone</strong>. 3 <strong>Rivalry</strong> for the interaction with <strong>Zombie World</strong>.</span>  <span>ED: 1 <strong>Mad Golden Lord</strong>, 1 <strong>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</strong>, 1 <strong>Dragostapellia</strong> (which is a use for the <strong>Dragonecro</strong> sitting on your board or to out<strong> Dragoon</strong>), 1 <strong>Theseus</strong>, and 1 <strong>MER</strong>. 1 <strong>Shogunsaga</strong> as another way to banish <strong>Psychopompos</strong>. 1<strong> Omega</strong>. 1<strong> Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</strong> which negates all of your opponent's banished monster effs and is literally 2 negates every turn. 1 <strong>Avendread Savior</strong> which is a <strong>Foolish</strong>. 2 <strong>Sucker</strong> for the draw power. 1 <strong>Halq</strong>. 1 <strong>Phoenix</strong> and 1 <strong>Linkuriboh</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck: 2 <strong>Golden Lord</strong> for removal going second. 3 <strong>Sword Master of the Bewitching Iris</strong>. Zombie games will be dragged out pretty long if your opponent wants to dig for the <strong>Zombie World</strong> or <strong>Rivalry</strong> out so having something that can help you end games quicker during that process helps (and its literally a free summon thanks to <strong>Jack-o-Bolan</strong>). 1 <strong>Pank</strong>. 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 3<strong> IDP</strong> which is funny with <strong>Zombie World</strong>. 3 <strong>Broken Line</strong> which I've never heard of until Pak brought it back up. Games are dragged out and having an omni-negate that can be used to slowly break boards is very useful.</span>"

Unfortunely, most old normal insect monsters are very weak, so I needed to add Basic Insect, Kamariki, etc. I also added 2 copies of Neo Bug plus 2 copies of Kamakiri #2 because this deck needs some good normal monsters. You can replace one of them with Gokibore, Komotooko, Killer Neddle, etc. Just pick the ones you like the most.  <strong>8 Effect Level 1-4 Monsters;</strong>  Pinch Hopper is one of the hearts of this deck. It will allow you to summon Insect Queen, Mother Spider, Hercules Beetle, every single high level monster from your hand not named Perfect Ultimate Great Moth. Cross-Sword Beetle gives you a nice support by allowing you to inflict piercing damage; Spyder Spider and Aztekipede are nice cards to have on your hand, since they give you some options. As you can see, these monster have random effects, since I'm not making a deck foccused on archetypes. This deck is casual. Also Weevil used a lot of effect monsters against Joey and Yugi (orichalcos arc), but they are too weak. You can use Flying Kamakiri #1, but keep on your minds that it only allows you to summon WIND monster with 1500 ATK or less. Most insects on this deck are EARTH, so I'm giving you an advice - don't use flying kamakiri 1!  <strong>6 High Level Monsters;</strong>  Wheret he fun begins. Hercules Beetle, Perfect Ultimate Moth and Insect Queen are Weevil's cards, so I added them. Hercules is a joke, but this is a casual deck I use against my friends in real life, so whatever. Mother Spider and Mantis are your other level 5-6 monsters, they are not broken and you can use them. Hundred-Footed Terror is an amazing-but-not-broken card, it can save you in some situations. On overall, these are the high level monster I like to use on my Weevil Deck. You can use the Metamorphosed Insect Queen is you want to, you can replace Hundred-Foot Terror with her. Theren's no reason to run Great Moth, but you can use Armored Bug, since it's a very strong normal insect monster.  <strong>20 Spells and Traps;</strong>  Just random support. Forest, the equip cards Weevil used against Yugi (Duelist Kingdom), and of course Cocoon of Ultra Evolution is one of the best cards of this deck. It's a new card, very recent, I know it. Howerver, running the old cocoon of evolution plus petit moth is pathetic, because they take too much time to summon the moths. Some traps and some spells are foccused on insect monsters as you can see."

It's too weak, even running 2 copies of Legendary Ocean I think it's not worth using it. Also the Aquabizarre Dragon is clearly based on Kairyu-Shin. So, I added 8 normal level 1-4 monsters (classic cards), and 8 effect level 1-4 monsters (most are recent cards, but nothing too OP). Fortress Whale, Legendary Fisherman and Amphibian Beast are must cards for this deck, and the other high level monster are level 5, because the main strategy of this deck is to use The Legendary Ocean effects in order to summon the level 5 monsters. Mixing old and new cards is a difficult task because I like to stick to our main theme (old school and Mako), so I tried me best to give this deck an original and old school touch.  . I didn't add Legendary Fisherman III because he's too OP, and that's not the purpose of this deck;  . You can use Kairyu-Shin, Giga Gagagigo, or Plesion Mecha Dragon and replace Aquabizarre or Salmon;  . Uminotaurus, Gilman, Blue Breaker and Warrior of Atlantis provide basic support, and they are not broken cards;  &nbsp;"

Cyber Dragon Infinity is rarely even needed. The deck list is basically copied from Yacine656. His youtube channel is essential viewing in order to understand the deck.

Raptor's favourite cards like King Rex, Serpent Night Dragon are a must. I added almost every single monster he used, the exceptions are Sword Arm of Dragon (too weak), Tyrant Dragon and Kaitoptera (anime card). I tried my best to stick with the old school theme and Rex.  8 normal level 1-4 monsters + 8 effect level 1-4 monsters: Basic normal monsters Rex used against Joey, and some new cards. Aside Gilasarus, Black Tyranno and Giant Rex, Rex Raptor did not use a single effect dinosaur monster, so I added some new dinos to power up this deck.  3 normal level 5-12 monsters + 3 effect level 5-12 monsters: Megazowler or Sword Arm of Dragon? It's a coin toss between them, I did pick Megazowler because of it's ATK. Ancient Dinobeast and Sauropod Brachion are optional cards, you can use Ultimate Tyranno, Superconductor Tyranno or Dark Dryceratops if you want to. Frostosaurus is an old cards, but it's remains one of the best level 6 normal monster out there."

First lets get to the main stategy is to summon  a Kaiju on your opponents side of the field, summon a Graydle, destroy it either through battle or through a card effect of a certain type and take control of it, If you don't have a Graydle in hand summoning your own Kaiju will do fine as well.  Each of the 3 main Graydles can be destroyed in ways other than battle.  Graydle Eagle can be destroy by a monster effect, preferable with Graydle Slime, allowing you to take control of it. If you set this card on the field you opponent will most likely try to destroy it with a monster deck especially if they don't know what kind of deck you're playing, this will disrupt their plays unless they have a way to negate it.  Graydle Alligator can be destroyed through a spell effect preferably with Graydle Impact or Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. If you use interrupted while the field spell is active summon Gameciel on your side of the field and any other Kaiju on your opponents side, Graydle Alligators effect will active allowing you to take control of your opponent's Kaiju and it will immediately be destroyed, this will generate 4 Kaiju counters allowing you at least 2 negates.  Graydle Cobra can be destroyed though trap effects which is where Graydle Split comes in, unless you opponent is running battle traps like Mirror Force which even then they most likely wont activate unless you have another monster on the field you most likely will be destroying it through battle.  Graydle Slime &amp; Slime Jr. are your tuners so they're required to make synchro plays.  Graydle Slime can be special summoned by destroying 2 Graydle cards you control, this includes spells &amp; traps so you can destroy Gradle monsters equiped to monsters you control, after that you can special summon a Graydle from you graveyard to set up a synchro summon. If you destroyed Graydle Eagle while it was in the main monster zone you can take control of a monster your opponent controls as well to use yourself as well as clear their field.  Slime Jr. can special summon a Graydle from your graveyard and then one from the hand of the same level, though be aware that if you activate his effect you will only be able to summon Graydle Dragon &amp; White Aura Whale though synchro summoning for the rest of the turn.  For the Kaijus they each have useful effects if you have the field spell out.  Dogoran can clear your opponents field of all their monsters at the cost of 3 counters, Gandarla can halve the ATK of all other monsters on the field on a quick effect for 3 counters, Gamaciel gets a non once per turn negate for 2 counters, &amp; Jizukiru can negate any effect that targets one card on the field and destroy it on a non one per turn quick effect, be aware that your opponent can use these against you. Mecha-Dogoran can remove 2 counters once per turn and equip a Kaiju from your hand or graveyard and gain ATK equal to that monster, I pretty much only have it in this deck so I can have another level 8 for synchro plays, so you can replace this one if you want.  For the spells Graydle Impact is useful for destroying your opponents cards or search out Gradyle card during the end phase. You can also use on Gradyle Alligator to make your opponent go -2 if the have a monster.  Interrupted Kaiju slumber will clear the field of monsters, special summon 2 Kaijus on both sides of the field and force them to battle. As mentioned before, if used in combination Graydle Alligator, you will clear your opponent's field of monsters. You can also use it's graveyard effect during your next turn to search another Kaiju.  Lastly Terraforming will help you search the field spell.  For the traps Gradyle Split will boost the ATK of on monster you control by 500 but it's main purpose is destroying one of your monsters and then summoning 2 Gradles from your deck so you can synchro summon. If used with Graydle Cobra you can take control of one of you opponens monsters as well.  And finally the trap Graydle Parasite will summon a Gradyle from your deck during your opponents battle plase and make them think twice before attacking. during your battle phase if your opponent has no monster ,but there's a monster in their graveyard that you want for your self, you can special summon it to their field and then crash into it with a Graydle to take control of it.  Now for the synchros, the main boss monster of the deck is Graydle Dragon, if summoned you can target and destroy cards your opponent controls up to the number of Water monsters used to summon it, which will be 2 if you used Gradyle Slime &amp; 3 if you use Slime Jr. If it's destroy you can summon a Water monster from the Graveyard with it's effect negated which won't matter for any monter in this deck aside from White Aura Whale's piercing damage.  Speaking of White Aura Whale it has a non cost Lightning Vortex effect when synchro summon &amp; can make 2 attacks on your opponents monsters with piercing damage. It's other effect will cause it to revive itself as a synchro turner by banishing a Water monster from the grave if it's destroyed by your opponents cards, which is where the Kaijus come in. If Gandarla is on your side of the field and you have enough counters, I recommend crashing White Aura Whale into a monster with higher ATK and chaining Gandarla's effect to it's revival effect. This effect will help summon 2 other synchro monsters.  Leo can be summoned using a level 8 monster and Slime Jr. Your opponent won't be able to target it outside your main phase 2 and will have a hard time beating over it due to having 100 more ATK than average for a level 10.  Star Eater can be summon by using a revived White Aura Whale and a level 3 Graydle, Your opponent won't be able to negate it summon with something like Solemn Judgement. It will also be unaffected by your opponents card effects until the end of the Damage Step  while it's attacking.  Final Sigma can be summoned using Jizukiru &amp; Slime Jr., It is unaffected by card effects outside it's archetype while in the extra monster zone which will protect it from Interrupted Kaiju Slumber. It also does double battle damage while in the extra monster zone, so I would not reccomend summoning more than one.  Finally the strongest monster in this deck is Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin, you can call it an bonus boss monster. This can be special summoned using a revived White Aura Whale and a level 8 monster. It can not destroyed by card effects and can summon the same number of tokens on both sides of the field on a spell speed 2 effect gaining 1000 ATK for each monster on the field and easily going up to 10000. You can summon a Kaiju on the opponents side to ATK for game.  That's my version of the Graydle Kaiju deck, feel free to make adjustments to it if you wish.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Royal Decree is helpful to defend against any traps that may prove to be annoying.  Aside from that, the monsters allow for a variety of different strategies to be utilized. Uni-Zombie and Gozuki are helpful for putting cards from the deck into the grave, which is a useful place to keep Doomking of Balerdoch and once per turn sending Glow-up Bloom to get access to  a lvl 5 or higher monster. Endless Decay is useful early in the game, but once opponent is no longer at max hp, it can be a helpful material for tribute. Il Blud, Zombie Master, and both Red-eye zombie monsters are helpful for special summoning from  either grave. Using the special summoning to get XYZ and Synchro monsters out is one tactic I tend to use."

I hope the card choices will help you build this deck by adding ideas.,"The pure version of Adamancipator focuses on getting the most value from engine cards and uses cards that are often overlooked like all main deck monsters and ""Adamancipator Friends"". Main deck hand traps are not only good for this format but also help synchro effects because they are of the Fire and Wind attribute. Book of Moon and Super Poly are versatile cards that are an interruption to your opponent's turn as well as cards that protect your monsters depending on the situation. This deck is definitely very competent at what it does and fun to play."

You can tell that because Dragoon is crammed in there at the end just to make it all work. It is, however, surprisingly usable. There's a modicum of synergy between the three archetypes in play here--the Dangers can drop both Quants and Shaddolls from your hands to trigger their effects, and the Quants provide the attributes necessary to take full advantage of the various Shaddoll fusion monsters.  <strong>However: </strong>because of how the Dangers (and, to a less effect, Super Quantal Fairy Alphan) work, this deck runs on a bit of randomness. You can't always control <em>exactly </em>what's going to happen, and the inherent chance for everything to go wrong and stop working on a dime is what drives this deck into the strictly ""casual"" territory. This deck is a toolbox, not a combo machine; you make what you can out of what you have, and sometimes what you can manage to bard out <em>will </em>surprise you.  This doesn't stop the deck from being able to put pretty convincing boards up when everything <em>does </em>go right, though: El Shaddoll Winda is a forever-great floodgate and is impossibly easy to summon with Verte Anaconda.  Backing Winda up with quick-effect interruption from the Quant Xyz monsters, Dragoon, Dingirsu, or Number 38 can be pretty paralyzing--Winda plus even just one of these is a comfortable place to be in, in more casual/non-meta settings. And in the (VERY LOW) chance you manage to put Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus on the board next to something like Winda, you're gonna feel real smug.  The main appeal of this deck is, honestly, the novelty. This is probably the weirdest way to play both Quants and Shaddolls, and probably the worst way to do it that actually works. It's also still a work in progress--ratios still feel weird, especially with the Quants. Anyone who wants to take a swing at ironing out the creases in this honestly ridiculous Frankenstein, be my guest.  Full credit to HardLegGaming's <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Danger Dolls</a> deck profile for the inspiration, and basically half the decklist. It's also a way better deck than whatever I spat out here. Check it out."

Dogmatika punishment can also be used to pop your own monsters if used with elder entity n'tss.  Kozmojo is just an amazing card giving you access to non-targeting banishment which can be an out to even red-eyes dark dragoon.  There can be only one does hinder your plays a little bit, though it isn't too detrimental to the deck as you'll more than likely have dark lady and maybe another machine on the field most of the time. Side it out at your own discretion.  Much of the sideboard is equipped to switch into a more banishing focused game plan, using cards like dimension shifter, different dimension ground, dimensional fissure, and macro cosmos to stun decks that rely heavily on the GY.  An honorable mention that I couldn't find room for was ""Back To The Front"" a normal trap thats searchable with trap trick can offer some much needed graveyard recursion if you arent playing the banish heavy strategy.  Having 2 sliprider can give you access to cyber dragon nova and cyber dragon infinity, giving you access to an annoying boss monster for the opponent to deal with, however rarely it might come up. It's still worth mentioning and running because the payoff infinity gives is so large.  Much like the cyber dragon lineup, dark destroyers give you access to possible rank 8 plays. I decided to go with hope harbinger, draglubion and numeron dragon. You can go into draglubion which can either summon hope harbinger for more disruption, or numeron dragon if you want to try to swing for game that turn."

I made the experience that most of the time you end on 2-3 negates if you go first, so you absolutely need to know when to interrupt your opponent.  Cyber Dragon is one of the oldest, still viable decks. Because of this, we look at one of the archetypes with the most support, and there are many different builds to use for Cyber Dragons. The Fusion OTK builds are completely lost in modern yugioh, the trap variant just rolls over and dies if it has to go second and the combo build is really vulnerable to interruptions. I myself play Cyber Dragons since I pulled my first Infinity in the 2016 Mega Tins and tried probably all possible deck lists, including pure-light builds with Photon Sanctuary or Wattfox-Turbo, but most of these decks took a big hit due to union carrier getting banned.  This list wouldn´t even run union carrier, the Anaconda Verte is your go-to link monster, with several big targets, including Dragoon, the Cyber Eternity Dragon and the highly underrated Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Just remember that you can not special summon any more after using Vertes effect, but this is not important most of the times.  Depending on your starting hand, this deck has multiple lines of plays, just keep that in mind, these vary also depending on your matchup.  <strong><span>Main Deck</span></strong>  To start of with the monsters, this list uses 3 Cyber Dragons as you take advantage of the numerous Machine Duplication targets.  As for the mini-Cyber Dragons, you obviously use 3 Cyber Dragon Core and Herz as these are your starters, and as an option one Nachster,  as he is also a Duplication target. One of the best cards in this deck ist the galaxy soldier, I am torn between playing him at 2 or 3, as he is no longer searchable with Photon Orbital. If you need the consistency boost or are looking for a card to replace the expensive Pot Of Prosperity, this would be a fine addition.  The Jizukiru is a powerful option against any tower monsters and is searchable with Cyber Repair Plant. The handtrap lineup is heavily influenced by the fact that the galaxy soldier needs a light monster to discard. The Gamma is actually a very nice handtrap as it hits most of the meta decks, the Ghost Ogre is more of a personal preference, you probably should still run Ash Blossom.  The spell line-up has some inconsistencies to other lists:  The Overload Fusion is a great card in my opinion, not only does it allow access into Chimeratech Rampage Dragon who let´s you discard 2 light machine monsters from your deck (Herz and Core are great targets, in some cases Cyber Dragon himself or just to thin the deck) or pop backrow including your Cybernetic Overflow to search a spell/trap. Therefore, I run it at 3.  The Instant Fusion is a nice filler and generates a body for XYZ summoning one of your interruptions. Depending on the matchup and your starting hand, a Durendal sometimes has a bigger impact on the game, as you can force your opponent to pop your Cybernetic Overflow instead of another effect and then nuke his board with it.  The Emergency Teleport is a remnant of an old build which used level 7/8 synchros, as you can special the Gamma or the Ghost Ogre with it, and there are some nice targets as Dawn Dragster or Omega, but as long as ET is still limited this seemed too clunky. I liked the extra body or negate bait, just because you can use the Gh0st Ogre to go into Verte Anaconda (in some cases you can use it to special a ghost ogre on your opponents turn as it can be activated on the field as well, but I do not remember a single time I used this).  I only play one Pot of Prosperity, if you are not on a budget you should probably play 3 because you can banish 6 cards from your extra deck nearly all the time as long as you know which one you will need in your matchup. I simply do not own any more copies of this card up to this point, you could replace the Emergency Teleport and the Instant Fusion.  <strong><span>Extra Deck</span></strong>  As for some of the extra deck monsters, keep in mind that Cyber Dragon has some of the best removal with the Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, killing Apolloussa and other contestants for the extra monster zone with ease. The space here is very thight, so if you feel the need to add anything I recommend to cut the Pleiades or the Instant Fusion/Panzer Dragon.  The Cyber Eternity Dragon is not only a target with the Overload Fusion, but also can be special summoned by Novas third effect, which most people seem to forget all the time. It gets protection from used Chimeratech Rampage Dragons or Panzer Dragon, and can revive a Cyber Dragon from the grave if summoned with Overload Fusion. Note that Cyber Dragon Sieger is probably the best target during your opponents turn.  The Sieger is an interesting card and is the card that enables the OTK variant of this deck, but I use him rarely and mostly just if I draw an Overload Fusion, as he can double the Chimeratech Rampage Dragons ATK, who attacks three times with 4200 ATK, enough to run over most threats or kill your opponent quickly.  The Almiraj and the Linkuriboh are some of the most important enablers for this deck as they put your normal summoned monsters in the grave, allowing the Cyber Repair Plant to search either a Galaxy Soldier, a Jizukiru or a Cyber Dragon Nachster. They can later be used as Material for Anaconda Verte.  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  The Side Deck focuses on beating different matchups. You have more backrow removal because often times you would not get to a Rampage Dragon, the standard handtraps against Combo decks (""how often did you summon this turn?""), and the Super Polymerization against decks with big boards or other Machine Decks, as the Eternity Dragon needs generic machine monsters. I tried out a DNA-Operation Super Polymerization variant in my trap build, but it was too reliant on drawing those cards, maybe the Pot of Prosperity could help this type of deck out, but it would still lose most of the time if it had to go second.  <strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>  Cyber Dragon has some really strong lines and the Anaconda Verte opens up so much variance. The weakness to handtraps still is the biggest problem for the deck, but it should not be underestimated."

The deck itself is fairly simple, to special summon Drytron cards then Ritual Herald out and get Vanity's Ruler out on turn 1 which is actually pretty easy, make sure you have at least 1 fairy card in your hand at all times to stop you opponent from activating anything with Herald's ability. Then once your opponent is locked out you can begin dealing damage, don't get too full of yourself and summon everything in your hand, you need those negates.  Use the field spell to get out Nova to then summon a Drytron from your hand, Delta is very good for draw power and Gamma will instantly get you the Drytron Ritual Monster out if you summon him correctly.  Honestly the Extra Deck isn't really necessary but will help you out in a tight spot, like linking to Unicorn or Pheonix if you need to get those numbers down in you've been Mystic Mined."

The traps are there to Special Summon Red-Eyes from the grave to then activate Inferno Fire Blast to deal either 2400 or 4800 damage as it's not once per turn.  The other in the extra deck or just there to keep things from going bad, Accesscode is very good at getting rid of an enemy Dragoon and the others for clearing the board.  I've entered many friend made tournaments with this deck and my friends hate how easy it is to summon Dragoon. You shouldn't really lose with it as long as you have Dragoon out and cards in your hand.  This Site won't let me class this as Meta but I'm sorry it clearly is."
