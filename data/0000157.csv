Combo that required Red-eyes DM Dragon to banish Pixie can be change to banish Striker Dragon instead. (Remove 1 Saryuja, add 1 Striker Dragon.) Which can help Dragoon play by adding 1 Boot Sector Launch. For Dragoon play and just go for 44 cards deck. (Remove Mardark and Miradora then add DM, REBD, REF and Boot Sector Launch) Then do something about extra deck yourself. (I would remove the World Legacy team.)  I already add Striker Dragon in this list.  &nbsp;  Dragonmaid Welcome can be sent to GY on your opponent turn using Parlor then all your maid cannot be target by card effect."

Favorite combo play:  &nbsp;  Overlay for number 23 using grapha and a danger monster  Activate a danger monster from the hand  Number 23 negates it by dethatching grapha and the danger monster returns to the hand  Summon another level 8 danger monster and summon grapha again  Overlay for Felgrand  Detatch grapha to target itself  Special summon another danger level 8 and grapha one last time  Then overlay for whatever negation xyz is best for your current opponent until you can't anymore or the field is full  &nbsp;  If you get multiple grapha and enough danger level 8 monsters, you can do up to 5 overlays in a turn before the field is too full. My favorite lockdown is with these cards:  Number 23  Felgrand  Number 38  Number 90  Evilswarm Nightmare  &nbsp;  This board means your opponents first effect of the turn is negated, you can negate 1 spell, you can negate 2 monster effects in two ways, and you can flip two special summoned monsters face down. Also number 38 can redirect attacks to itself, protecting the weaker parts of the lock. This should be difficult for a lot of decks to overcome. You can also sub other monsters for Number 90 and number 38 depending on your opponent, like number 68 or dingirsu. Finally, when you have this lock, you have over 8k attack on board and ready for next turn. If somehow they stop your otk next turn, use your empty XYZ monsters and whatever else you like to summon Aollousa for 4 monster negations on their next turn. If you know they run battle fader or a similar hand trap, summon apollousa and build up the field to otk first. You can negate battle fader, but it returns to the hand. However, you can negate it 4 times with apollousa, ensuring your OTK will land.  &nbsp;  If going second, summon removal if needed, or just do the lock down play to OTK. Favorite play going second is:  Dingirsu to remove a backrow  Pain gainer to clear front row (Summon a second rank 8 first if needed to boost the def for the effect)  Seven Sins to beat down and remove next turn if needed  Then keep summoning until I can OTK"

It's a really fun deck with a lot of options.,"<b>I made 2 previous versions but realised the deck lacked something. I switched around some cards and put some backrow removal and kaijus in it.</b>  This deck has 2 goals. Summoning high level xyz with the trains, the Flying Pegasus and the Anchor Drill. And getting your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant out. Ancient Gears on their own are not that good in my opinion so a little support from an archetype that can frequently summon is nice.  &nbsp;  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>You don't really want to draw this card. You can't special summon it and tribute summoning this thing gets countered very easily which ends up with you losing 2 or three cards (if geartown is on the field only 2). It's why I put them at 1. I don't think you will even use more than 1 Golems in a duel. The longer the duel lasts the harder it becomes to win.  <strong>Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon: </strong>I can hear you thinking to yourself; ""Why Gadjiltron Dragon? Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon is much better!!"" True the card is better, but for what we are trying to do here Gadjiltron Dragon suits this deck better with it 8 star scaling. With this card you can get very easily into Seven Sins and banish your oponnent's monsters often locking them out of their effects in the process. This card is searchable with Urgent Schedule, Ancient Gear Wyvern and can be returned from the graveyard using Bullet Express Train. So only 2 as well.  <strong>Ancient Gear Wyvern: </strong>This card is basically the Elemental Hero Stratos of this deck. It searches out any Ancient Gear cards in your deck. You can extend the combo searching for Ancient Gear Box first and then using the effect of Box you can add an Ancient Gear Frame or Infinitrack Anchordrill to your hand. You go plus 2 for no cost so run three at all times.  <strong>Ancient Gear Box:</strong> This the garnet in the deck so you really don't want to draw it. I run the card at one because it is recyclable so you can just use it from the graveyard again. Running at 2 could be possible too but I would not recommend it at three. The risk of drawing it increases substantially.  <strong>Ancient Gear Hunting Hound: </strong>A walking polymerization. When summoned it does 600 damage to your opponent but We use it for its ability to fusion summon any Ancient Gear monster. Often we fuse into Ancient Gear Howitzer to get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field. Use 2 or 3  <strong>Ancient Gear Howitzer:</strong> In my opinion a very underrated card. Unaffected by card effects and it can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent... Every turn. Your opponent probably wants this card destroyed. But if for some reason he doesn’t and you don’t really care for the burn effect you can always destroy it yourself to get Ancient Gear Golem out to fusion summon a Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. If you have Ancient Gear Golem out in the field and you use Ancient Gear Fusion you can use material from the deck to complete the summon instead. So Howitzer is a powerful card that opens the path to an even better card. We run 1 or 2.  <strong>Super Express Bullet Train</strong>: A rank 10 train card that is very easy to bring out. All you need, is to have only earth machine monsters on the field. Usually the plan is to bring out this card together with Heavy Freight Train Derricane and possible Flying Pegasus and Anchordrill to xyz summon your bossmonsters. Downside is that it can’t attack without sending 2 cards you control to the graveyard. This however poses no problem for us because we only use it as xyz fodder. A nice extra is that it lets you take back a card from the graveyard to your hand if Bullet train is in the graveyard that turn. I run 2. I wouldn’t use three to prevent bricking.  <strong>Infinitrack Anchordrill:</strong> Has enormous synergy with the Ancient Gear archetype. It is usable for Ancient Gear Box because it has 500ATK and it can summon another card from the hand. Besides that it can combine the stars for both cards making lets say Gadjiltron Dragon and Anchordrill fodder for the rank 12 xyz Seven Sins.  <strong>Heavy Freight Train Derricane: </strong>Just like Bullet Express Train it is so easy to bring out. Use this card for xyz fodder too. Ideally we run 2.  <strong>Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede: </strong>Lets you summon a card from your graveyard in defense position but without its effect. Nice effect but we will use its secondary one more often. It lets us copy the level of another face up card to either Flying pegasus or the other way around. Best used with the trains or level 8 monsters. I use 3.  <b>Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju: </b>When testing this deck online, I often see cards like Red Eyes Dark Dragoon or other cards with negates and protection. For now it is in the main deck. But if it is not to your liking you can always change it for an extra Hunting Hound, AG Fusion or Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord.  <strong>Machina Citadel: </strong>we use it as xyz fodder and sometimes you can use its effect to destroy your opponent's monsters. One is enough.  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells/Traps</strong>  <strong>Ancient Gear Catapult: </strong>We use Catapult to pop Geartown and summon Ancient Gear golem and Wyvern to get into Chaos Giant. Only way to really summon Golem aside from tributing and using Howitzer. Run three at all times, it is the foundation of the Ancient Gears.  <strong>Geartown:</strong> Used in tandem with Catapult this can give you a Chaos Giant and more. Like Catapult, run three at all times.  <strong>Ancient Gear Fusion: </strong>If used with Ancient Gear Golem you can search the deck for materials too. Chaos Giant can be out in one turn this way. I would runtwo or three.  <strong>Urgent Schedule:</strong> This card lets you summon 2 monsters from the deck. One lvl four or lower and one level five or higher. This used to be quite an expensive card but is more affordable nowadays. Getting 2 free summons when your opponent controls more cards is very helpful for your xyz and fusion plays. I recommend running 3.  <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster: </strong>Good for backrow removal but limited, so one.  <strong>Twin Twisters:</strong> Good for backrow removal and to pop Geartown. also one.  <strong>Solemn Strike:</strong> Just nice to negate an effect or special summon. Run one.  <strong>Solemn Judgement: </strong>To negate cards that would otherwise break your board. Run one.  <strong>Unending Nightmare:</strong> Nice for backrow removal and to pop your own cards like Geartown. we use 2.  &nbsp;  <strong>The extra deck</strong>  <strong>Double Headed Anger Knuckle:</strong> This card is good for getting those level 10 cards on the field. We use only one.  <strong>Ancient Gear Ballista:</strong> This card is a godsend for Ancient Gear players. It synergizes immensely with the trains and earth machine monsters in general. It only requires 2 earth machine monsters to summon it. Ballista can add one Geartown to your hand or any Ancient Gear Monster in the main deck. Usually what you want to do with this card is to add a Geartown to your hand, you play it and then activate Ballista’s secondary effect to reduce an opponent’s monster ATK/DEF to zero and send the Geartown to the graveyard as cost which in turn activates Geartown’s effect.  <strong>Chaos Ancient Gear Giant:</strong> The one card I’ve been talking about so much. With his 4500 atk and powerful effect it’s a force to be reckoned with. Unaffected by spell and trap cards and the option to attack every monster your opponent controls once. If that wasn’t good enough already it does piercing damage too. Run 1 or 2, it depends really.  <strong>Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem: </strong>Sporting an attack of 4400 this card this card is quite the powerhouse too. Its effect isn’t as good as Chaos Giant but it can get an Ancient Gear Golem on the field when destroyed, giving you the chance to get another Chaos Giant. We run 1 or 2.  <strong>Megaton Ancient Gear Golem:</strong> Essentially a weaker version of Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. When fusion summoned with more than one Ancient Gear Golem it can attack multiple times in your battle phase. When destroyed by card effect you can get your Ultimate Golem out and that way you could get an Chaos Ancient Gear Giant too.  <strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: </strong>A rank 11 xyz easily summoned using Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora. Can attack up to the number of attached materials plus one. You can boost the attack of this card by 2000 by detaching one card which makes Liebe a powerful beatstick. 1 is more than enough.  <strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora:</strong> Can detach one card to make another unaffected by card effects. When used on Chaos Giant it makes the card nearly invincible.  <strong>Number 77 Seven Sins:</strong> Out of all the rank 12 cards this one is the easiest to summon. There are 3 ways to summon it and they all have their merits.. We can summon it the normal way by using 2 rank 12 monsters, this has the advantage that we can use its effect immediately and banish your opponent monsters. The only downside here is that seven sins has only 1 card to protect itself when targeted for battle or by card effects unless you don’t activate the effect. The second way involves xyz summuning Rank 8 Dingirsu Orcust of The Evening Star to your field. You then overlay Pain Gainer on it and then into Seven Sins. Last way to summon it is to xyz summon Ravenous Tarantula into Sevens Sins or first into Pain Gainer and then Seven Sins. We run only one, the resources needed for this card are substantial enough that you probably won’t get another one on the field.  <strong>Number 84 Pain Gainer</strong>: Also 2 ways of summoning it but doing it the normal way  is not really possible in this deck. We mostly use Dingirsu or Ravenous Tarantula to summon it instead. Usually this card is just a stepping stone for Seven Sins or if you can summon Seven Sins the normal way and still have room for Pain Gainer it can be a good card on its own. We Also run one.  <strong>Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula:</strong> If used a bit further down the duel this card will turn all your monsters into beatsticks on steroids. It adds the difference in life points as attack and defense to face up cards you control. This in combination with a Chaos Giant will completely destroy any monster. We mostly use the rank 10 trains or a Flying Pegasus to Xyz into it. If you decide to not go further the xyz chain and keep it as it is you can punish special summoning with it too. Every time your opponent special summons a monster they lose 600 lifepoints. And if that wasn’t enough you can detach one monster to destroy all monsters your opponent controls that have attack less or equal to this card. You could run 2 but I run one.  <strong>Dingirsu The Orcust of The Evening Star:</strong> Really a good staple as well. I am actually inclined to use Dingirsu more then Harbinger in duels. You can use this card for Pain Gainer too. Aside from that it can protect cards from destruction by detaching materials. Run 2.  <strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid: </strong>Can be used as material for Dora when you destroy a monster by battle. It has build in protection as well. I would run 1, it’s a good card but I don’t use it all that often.  <strong>There is no side deck in this profile. I leave this to your imagination. </strong>"

If only Shaddoll Schism was in this game...  PSY-Frame package is here for light fodder and also if you happen to be in the position of summoning PSY-Framelord Lambda, which can help you to negate those monsters which you will prefer not banish (or discard) for Mechaba's effect.  Don't forget to summon Cross-Sheep!

If you have Junk Converter in your hand, you use its effect to discard itself and a tuner to search Junk Synchron (if it's already in your hand, search Synchron Carrier instead) and summon said Junk Synchron to revive Converter. Synchro summon Junk Speeder with them (if you have Carrier on the field, summon Hyper Librarian instead and follow up by using Converter to revive your synchron and summon Speeder with it and Carrier, either way you want HL on the field) and summon Cyberse Synchron (preferably) and some others like Steam Synchron. Basically just keep Synchro Summoning until you run out of gas.  <strong>WARNING:</strong> This Deck plays like an automobile. It's really easy to get momentum going, but when you lose that momentum, it's very noticeable. This deck's gas is the Tuners.  What's a Synchron Deck without Stardust Dragon?"

Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y tener en campo a Spiral Dragon, junto a un tuner y un no tuner.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket, lo cual es sencillo. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial.

It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series. ""Rokket"" is a play on the word ""rocket"". Its Japanese name, ""Vullet"", is a corruption of ""bullet"", playing on the tendency of Japanese to replace ""V"" sounds with ""B"" ones. It may also reference the archetype's user in the anime, Varis, who shares a similar gun and ammunition theme in his original Japanese name and the design of his mask. The ""Borrel"" archetype uses the same play with the word ""barrel"".

Thunder Dragons have always been a favorite of mine (after dragon link of course!) and it is very unfortunate that Colossus is STILL on the banlist (WHY KONAMI WHY??). I also noticed that I have not uploaded a single thunder dragon deck on this site and a bunch of people have been requesting this build. For these reasons, I have decided to upload one!! This deck is a full 60 deck and I would give it a solid rogue tier in the current metagame. It won’t win an LCS or anything but it is a very fun deck to play and I guarantee you that you can even win duels sometimes. I have once again gone all out on a deck explanation (sigh, this is 60 cards) so I really hope you enjoy it!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a quick reminder that the deck explanation, All the combos, test hands, deck explanations and ways to best use your resources are ALL on my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and the channel!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQnrpwVoLAw</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Deck Ratios</b><span> - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note: some cards may be in more than 1 category </span>  &nbsp; <table>  <tr> <td><b>Thunder Dragon engine</b><span> - Thunder Dragon cards and cards in the deck that support them </span></td> <td><span>For this engine we have 3 Vanilla Thunder Dragon, 3 dragondark, 3 Dragonroar, 2 dragonmatrix, 1 dragonhawk, 1 fusion and 1 Gold Sarcophagus. We are not playing lupine or solar since this is not a pure build, it also involves a lot of other engines. Fusion is usually a 2 of but we are only running 1 because we only need 1 titan, same reason as for not playing solar and lupine. Dragondark is the best thunder dragon in my opinion since it searches and Dragonroar is good because it gives you access to dragondark and dragonmatrix. The vanilla is played for extra pops with titan and for graveyard and card advantage. Matrix is a solid card which also adds to the pops. Notice all the thunders can be recycled with fusion and The chaos creator. Fusion is usually not a card you want to draw, it is one that you mill using verte (the reason we only play 1 copy). Sarcophagus is great since it can banish any thunder directly from the deck to trigger it’s banish effect. Hawk is just a great searchable extender and can be used to bring back titan from the grave as well (if needed). That is basically all for the thunder engine, who’s main purpose is to generate card and graveyard advantage and turbo titan. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Chaos engine</b><span> - cards that can be search with chaos space basically</span></td> <td><span>Oh my god we have a lot of stuff for this! Here we go - 3 Valkaria, 2 lavineer, 1 black dragon, 1 white dragon, 2 emperor, 3 creator and 3 chaos space. Chaos space can search any of these so it is a really good card to open. It can also recycle and generate SOOO much card advantage. Valkaria and the baby chaos dragons are your best chaos monsters (to draw) because they only require 1 light or dark in the grave, they are level 4 and because they generate some sort of advantage (the baby chaos dragons search each other and Valkaria can mill when banished). Lavineer is also amazing since it can be used to hand rip OR pop 2 cards on the field OR even monster reborn a monster from the grave!! It also requires 3 banishes which can be useful if you have multiple thunders in the GY. Emperor can recycle any of your banished dragons by destroying itself (this puts it in your extra deck), and then it can be summoned from the extra deck by banishing a light and dark from the grave and can also clear the field if needed. It generates a lot of advantage especially since both effects will be used to the fullest. Creator is also making since it can special back from the banish zone (thunders!!) and recycle which is really really good and is the reason I am maxing out on this. The main reason this in in the deck is to swarm the field, go into rank 8 plays and link plays, and to banish the thunders in the graveyard to generate all sorts of advantage. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Lightsworn engine</b><span> - cards that search raiden and mill basically</span></td> <td><span>We have 3 charge and 2 raiden. Charge is the best opener since charge + level 4 extender = mill 9 + chaos ruler + search a light or dark (see combos in video for more info and how to achive that). Raiden is just a 2 of, great tuner as well. Main reason this in in the build is because raiden is your main normal summon (alongside tracer) and because you need to mill cards to generate advantage. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Rokket engine </b><span>- cards that support the rokket archetype </span></td> <td><span>The rokket engine is - 3 quick launch, 3 rokket tracer, 1 rokket recharger and 1 boot sector launch. The main reason this is even in the deck is to turbo out chaos ruler from the extra deck. Very self explanatory and can also be used to go into romulus and fetch a ravine if you have another dragon out. Rokkets are a solid and splashable engine. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Pendulum dragon engine</b><span> - You will NEVER actually pendulum summon but this is basically good dragons that can be searched using revolution dragon. </span></td> <td><span>For this engine we have 3 Revolution, 2 emperor and 1 darkwurm. Revolution can search both emperor and darkwurm since they are pendulum dragons and can also reborn something like hope harbinger from the grave (does not require materials to negate). Revolution is just such an amazing draw and it also serves as an additional body in the GY if you use it’s discard effect. Emperor is just SOOOOO good!! It recycles any of your banished dragons by destroying itself (this puts it in your extra deck), and then it can be summoned from the extra deck by banishing a light and dark from the grave and can also clear the field if needed (also level 8)! What a card!! Darkwurm is good because it is a free special summon and is just a solid pick in general. It is really good if opened with ravine and can also be milled with ravine. The main purpose of this engine is to generate advantage and swarm the field. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Danger! Engine - </b><span>literally danger cards</span></td> <td><span>We have - 3 mothman, 1 Nessie, 1 jack and 1 thunderbird. These ratios might sound weird to you but there is a specific reason these are the ones I chose. I chose ones that generate some kind of card/grave advantage if discarded (except thunderbird which is there just to summon off of jack). Moth is also a level 4 which synergies with the rokket and lightsworn engine (to turbo out ruler) and it can also be linked off or used to summon Douglass which generates more card/grave advantage. No snake because if discard it brings itself back, which is good but it does not put a danger in the grave (all the others that have good discard effects stay in the grave as chaos banish targets). Dangers main purpose in this is to spam monsters, go for rank 4 palys, dig deeper into the deck, draw cards and to help get stuff into the grave. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Dragon Ravine Engine</b><span> - cards that go with Dragon ravine</span></td> <td><span>We have - 3 Dragon Ravines, 1 terraforming, 1 foolish burial, 1 black wing elite, 1 galactic spiral and 1 seyfert. We are playing maximum ravines because we will not always have access to it and because the card is literally fire. Opening multiple copies is also AMAZING! Keep in mind that ravine is not a hard once per turn so the blackwing can bounce ravine to summon itself and then you can use ravine again! Sadly the blackwing is once per duel :( foolish burial can mill anything in the entire deck so why not run it? Seyfert and Spiral are mill targets for ravine to recycle and go into rank 8 plays respectively. We are not running seyfert as a normal summon to search the baby chaos dragons because we cannot afford to waste our normal summon on it. If opened, it should (in most cases) just be discarded.

Just build going first focused deck at that point. oh wait HERO boards are super breakable? ok then put in three e for baits, and make it so that your wincon for going first dark law which percentage is not too bad i think. I tried to calculate it but i got the wrong calculations, anyway for going to second build a board with stratos. Cool little trick you can do is mailcous bane on board effect into mask change, epic board clear, unless you're playing aginst dragon link in which case you can attack in the first place. take trinity out because we are breaking boards with super poly. easy fix to all of this is to play droplets then you don't have to spend any slots  on superpoly targets and it is easy street, plus helps discard le brick."

This is by far the best ratio I found. (In-depth strategy.) MAKE SURE YOU GO SECOND. The goal of this deck is to draw a revealer and either speaker or Wayne. If you don't draw but draw Wayne or speaker then don't worry, there is still hope. Summon one ice barrier monster, then special summon Wayne, or speaker, or prior. Just slowly grow your board until you have enough for Trish Zero. In case of emergency use both defender and necromancer to lock you, enemy, out of attacking. Use any of the protectors to just protect yourself. If you want you can splash some hand traps or other cards. The only way to otk is to not let the opponent play, restrict them until your ready.

I think BB has a lot of potential, so here's what I think could be a pretty good meta build. It includes a Dogmatika engine, using Punishment to up the control aspect and increase pressure on the opponent. I leaned heavier into a trap focus for this variant, as I went for a large line up of traps and floodgates. Of course, this is a going 1st control deck. I feel like this has a lot of potential for the new meta. Also, let's not forget the good old Buster Lock which destroys a ton of decks. This deck is naturally capable of pulling it off."

In order to counter your opponents side deck swap, toss in your whole side deck which is a Mystic Mine burn engin","SO, this is by far my favorite deck. Even with ZEXAL banned Numerons still work very well. It's just a matter of how you do it. The main deck is a Numeron Kaiju engine. If you can get Numeron Network, and your opponent has 1 or 2 monsters it is an OTK. Replace a monster with a kaiju (or both with lava). One other note, is if you can USE THE KAIJUS ON DRAGOON. It is by far the best counter, and you need to do it before you use Numeron Networks effect because you can only summon 1 monster after you use it's effect. All the hand traps are for interrupting, and then you have all of the searches. Interdimentional Matter Transport isn't a good card, normally, BUT in this deck if I clear my Infinitrack or Mekk knight, I can activate my Numeron Network.  Extra Deck: All the Numeron monsters work off of Calling/Network, Infinitrack and Mekk knight are to clear off your Numerons so you don't have to have an empty board. Linkuriboh is there to counter tokens and to drop off your extra Numeron XYZ monster.  Side deck: This is when the whole deck gets fun, toss your whole extra deck into the main deck and drop the following cards from your main deck: Numeron Wall (3), Numeron Network (3), Numeron Calling (3), Memories of Hope (2), Interrupting Kaiju Slumber (2), and Interdimensional Matter Transport (2). Now your deck is a Mystic Mine burn deck.  As cheesy as this deck is, it works very very well and can counter cards like Nibiru, which your opponite will add after the first round. I do believe that this deck can be used in a competitive format. Let me know what you think of this deck!  ~Lt. Banger"

It's not very strong going 1st although you can get some okay boards going and at least a negate. I added Dangers and Performages just to give the deck a bit of a splash and to summon generic extra deck stuff easier (note: all of the Plunder ships are generic to summon except for Blackbeard). I got the idea of splashing some of these monsters from my previous deck which functions similarly as they both are discard heavy. How I play this deck is very aggressive, and the main idea is to break boards (hence the Kaiju package). The Knightmares are staples, and they benefit from Brann's ATK boost. Most Plunder decks use Bahamut and Toad, but I use it mostly as a backup. Dragite is kinda the star in ways since it's very easy to summon, and you have access to an easy negate. My favorite card in here is Draco Berserker because it's an OTK enabler and disruptor. The easiest way to understand this deck is to try and summon as much as you can to go into the ships to banish or negate monsters and to gain tremendous ATK boosts for an OTK. This deck going 2nd works extremely well, and you have options to summon a few different monsters other than Plunders. However, some of the Plunder monsters may lock you into only summoning their archetype, but it's not that big of a problem. Just note to always equip the Plunders to their ships if you can. The deck is a bit fast and you might accidentally drop your hand while building a board. Another thing is to try learning every Plunders' full effects. They do a couple of different things. I hope this deck helps some of you guys out if you are looking into building this. Feel free to ask any questions too."

Uses the same strategies as in 2012, so have fun playing it. <h2>Overview</h2> For those new in the archetype, your job is to have your <em>Gladiator Beasts</em> fight <strong>and</strong> survive those figthts. During the end of the Battle Phase (any player's), you can return them to the deck and Special Summon another <em>Gladiator Beast</em> monster with a different name (hereafter refered as <em>tag-out</em>) to activate their effects, which are triggered when they are Special Summoned by the effect of a <em>Gladiator Beast </em>monster. Furthermore, by returning to the deck, you can Fusion Summon (hereafter refered as <em>contact fusion </em>or simply<em> contact)</em> several strong monsters that can also <em>tag-out).</em> In order to <em>tag-out</em>, you need to survive fights, which wou will be able to do with some support, cards like <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a></strong>, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heraklinos&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast </strong><strong>Heraklinos</strong></a>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Shrink"">Shrink</a></strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a></strong> will aid in prevention of effects, manipulating battle positions and increasing-decreasing Attack stats to have your beasts fight and survive, and even if you are to take Battle Damage, you'll get in return field control as will be discussed below. <h3>The Combatants</h3> <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>:</strong> Not a beast, but a great hand trap that aids in prevention of your main monsters' destruction by battle. She can be swapped with any of the other hand traps in the Side Deck, depending on your needs.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>:</strong> Her main use will be to send <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiary"">Gladiator Beast Bestiary</a></strong> to the GY to <em>contact </em>for <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong>, although due to her effect changing her level, you could send a level 5 or higher <i>Gladial</i> to <em>contact</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></strong>.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Augustus&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast</strong> <strong>Augustus</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This beatstick has a good attack stat (above 2500 which helps against a lot of common threats), but his primary use will be to Special Summon a level 5 or higher <em>Gladiator Beast</em> from your hand to <i>contact</i><em> summon </em><strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a></strong>, or <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Gladiator Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bestiary&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Gladiator Beast </strong><strong>Bestiary</strong></a>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Laquari"">Gladiator Beast Laquari</a></strong>, or simply <em>contact</em><b> <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andabata"">Gladiator Beast Andabata</a></b>. You could also Link Summon <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Dragases"">Gladiator Beast Dragases</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a></strong> if in need of more board options.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Bestiary"">Gladiator Beast Bestiary</a>:</strong> One of the most important <em>Gladials</em> in the archetype, for both its ability to clear enemy backrow, and to <em>contact summon</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong>. You could run 3 copies, though I feel you can recycle them easily enough via <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a></strong>, and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a></strong>.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong><strong>:</strong> This guy's job is to revive his teammates to swarm the board, or simply to <em>contact</em> an useful Summon. Because he negates their effects, brought-back monsters won't activate their effects, but still helps in cycling strategies.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Equeste"">Gladiator Beast Equeste</a></strong><strong>:</strong> Another recycle card. This one is useful because it targets a <em>Gladiator Beast</em> <strong>card</strong>, so you can bring to hand spells and traps, namely, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a></strong>, which is a strong defensive option.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Laquari"">Gladiator Beast Laquari</a>:</strong> Laquari's there to establish an ofensive board, bringing 2100 Attack when Summoned by another <em>Gladiator Beast</em>, and serving as main <em>contact </em>material for <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a></strong>.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Murmillo"">Gladiator Beast Murmillo</a>:</strong> This fish is a destroy option, being the counterpart to Bestiary. However, he is slightly weaker due to reduced stats.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a></strong><strong>:</strong> This beast is a great defensive option, and depending on how you play him, you can establish board during your opponent's turn, by allowing a clean board to spam beasts, depending on how or what you bring: for example, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a></strong> helps with an early contact next turn, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Sagittarii"">Gladiator Beast Sagittarii</a></strong> for card cycling, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a></strong> for readying a play next turn by returning a monster to your deck, etc.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Retiari"">Gladiator Beast Retiari</a>: </strong>GY removal tool. Simple yet so useful.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Sagittarii"">Gladiator Beast Sagittarii</a>:</strong> Strong draw option, which the deck can get some help with. Also establishes GY that can be used with <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Darius"">Gladiator Beast Darius</a> </strong>for easy <em>contact</em> or Link.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a>:</strong> A great ofensive option, Special Summoning himself from the hand when battling, granting 500 Attack to all your monsters, which will surprise your opponent. He also <em>contacts</em> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong>, if you need to do so.  <strong><a data-name=""Test Tiger"">Test Tiger</a>:</strong> Not a <em>Gladiator Beast</em>, but a really strong support. Its effect is to bring another monster and activate their effects due to <em>tag-out</em>. Summons itself, so you can also Link with him, though simply <em>tagging</em> is more efficient most of the time. <h3>The Tools of Battle</h3> Spells are pretty straightforward in this deck, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beasts's Comeback"">Gladiator Beasts's Comeback</a> </strong>is a revival/summoning tool from hand or GY for <em>tag-out</em>, Link or <em>contact fusion</em>, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Proving Ground"">Gladiator Proving Ground</a></strong> is a search option/deck thinner, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Rejection"">Gladiator Rejection</a></strong> is an interesting defensive/ofensive tool, <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Respite"">Gladiator Beast's Respite</a></strong> is strong card draw, <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Raigeki&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Raigeki </strong></a>and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Harpie's Feather Duster&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong></a> are just self-explainatory, and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Shrink&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Shrink </strong></a>is a powerful and unexpected removal tool that has great synergy with this deck.  On traps, you won't use that many, being an aggresive deck, there's no time for waiting. <strong><a data-name=""Defensive Tactics"">Defensive Tactics</a></strong> prevents destruction and allows to go all-in without taking battle damage, plus it self-cycles to the deck, and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast War Chariot"">Gladiator Beast War Chariot</a></strong> prevents handtraps, several monster effects and disrupts a great deal of monsters, as it does not target. <h3>The New Challengers</h3> <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andabata"">Gladiator Beast Andabata</a>:</strong> Its main use lies in its attack stat, and summoning <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong> easily enough (being the only Level 7 or lower in the Extra Deck).  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a>:</strong> Great defensive tool with monster effect denial. Also has great presence due to its high stats, and can be brought with ease. Have fun.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a>:</strong> One of the best <em>contacts</em> since early stages of <em>Gladiator Beast</em>'s life as a deck. Destroying up to two <strong>cards</strong> is just too strong, and bringing two gladiators when <em>tagging-out</em> is just too good. He is also Summoned way too easy, having several options to bring him in.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a>:</strong> His greatest strength lies in both high stats and good effect that is not activated once per turn, though costs a card to be discarted. He also <em>cannot tag-out</em>, which limits his versatility, but bringing both him and <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong> will be a big enough board to have your opponent think as their options will be thinner.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Nerokius"">Gladiator Beast Nerokius</a></strong><strong>:</strong> Nerokius has an ancient gear-like effect, so <em>tagging</em> with him will be easier, as he has a strong Attack stat, and by doing so, you'll bring another two monsters to control the board even easier.  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>:</strong> A big powerhouse of the deck, which is one of the newest and strongest fusions, as its effect of Special Summoning fusion monsters from the Extra Deck will aid in a lot of control, bringing in <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Heraklinos"">Gladiator Beast Heraklinos</a></strong> for spell/trap negation,  <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Domitianus"">Gladiator Beast Domitianus</a></strong> for effect denial, or maybe <strong><a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Gyzarus"">Gladiator Beast Gyzarus</a></strong> for destruction.

Imp Sabre is used to remove Red-Eyes Fusion from my hand so Anaconda can be used.  Testing Ghost Ogre to get another use of Emergency Teleporter. Can potentially put Ogre out as another disruption.  Testing out the Artifact package. Rusty can destroy Scythe during opponent's turn to lock them out of their extra deck.  Forbidden Droplet and Access Code Talker are expensive cards. These cards are helpful but ultimately not needed. Dark Ruler No More is a decent sub for Droplet, and Apollousa is a decent sub for Talker.  Everything else is pretty standard.  &nbsp;"

I play zoodiac for some time now so i wanted to shar with you my deck inspired by OCG. Unfortunately we dont have powerhouse known as Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon who dominate in OCG zoodiac variants. This variant rans a lot of hand traps and traps because you dont have a good turn one ( preaty much drident pass). You want go first if it is possible because anti spell fragrance and macro cosmos dominated todays meta decks. You second turn shud have easy Zeus on the field and we all know how powerful is Zeus.  I think this is enaf info i will give you a chance to explore it for yourself see ya"

I hope everyone enjoys my first deck list feedback is appreciated and let me know if everyone has as much fun with this deck as I do."

Also it's funny banishing all of your opponent's monsters.  The main strategy is to recycle Crystal Girl enough until you get the Legendary Fishermans you need, while also doing invoked stuff. There Can Be Only One was added as a floodgate to slow the game down while you do that and it works because this deck uses different types.  I've found Crystal Girl &amp; Aleister to be a good opening hand. Use Invocation for Cocytus and then activate Crystal Girl to get a search in the End Phase.  All TCG except Crystal Girl and The Ice-Bound God (Side-Deck).  Side Deck is comprised of possible addition cards. Tips are welcome and encouraged. I really want to find a way to make Legendary Fisherman III work efficiently."

If there is no disruptions from opponent and you didnt draw a dead hand, this deck can make ridiculous boards (they do get countered by droplet or dark ruler no more). main focus is to abuse thunder dragons (and other cards) as much as possible and extract it all via link sumoning (or synchro summoning). it is recommended to 1st summon appolousa to counter nibiru, or just any link 4 with arrow wich points down vertically so you can possibly abuse knightmare link 2's etc. while cracking your opponents board. I have made 4 link 4's and a dragoon all in 1 turn 2 test hand, given no disruptions."
