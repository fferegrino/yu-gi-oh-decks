You need to make safer game development where you analyze Risk vs Reward. Playing Dino is having a time advantage in that you prioritize reducing your opponent's hit points as quickly as possible over a long-term game plan. So I'm used to playing Dino with very few engine cards as you can see and having at least 14 tech slots to choose to go second and OTK. You want to end the game still in the Early game because your power peak happens in the first turns having much less time to make the decisive choices of the game and they will have a much bigger impact. That's why you play around global threats and try to find combos and synergies as soon as possible. That said, I want to show you some combos that I don't see anyone doing the right way, which is to take advantage of Misc's protection to make Dolkka as soon as possible and only then play Scrap and end up with the follow-up Omega returning Misc to GY.  Scrap Dino Banlist Combos: to see the replay go to ""duelingbook"" and put the rest of the URL after .com/  Basic Combo playing around handtrap: replay?id=813757-30057365  Archosaur + Baby or Petit (remember Arc + Baby = Ovi + Baby = Misc + Baby = Ovi + Misc - just have a little details in the start but the end board is the same)  Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Wyvern + Rex  ou  Full Combo (Don't play around handtraps): replay?id=813757-30057632 Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Dweller  Lost World + Oviraptor (does not play around hand trap): replay?id=813757-29666506 = Tyranno + Omega + Wyvern + Raptor Note: in this combo when I skip the Wyvern 1st effect to summon any Scrap and destroy the same Scrap summoned and when I summon the 2nd Raptor I destroy the token in opponent field;  Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus (does not play around hand trap): replay?id=813757-29674813 Basic Combo if you open with 1 Scrap Raptor in hand or don't want to use both Raptor leaving 2nd Wyvern effect alive on opponent's turn: = Tyranno + Dolkka or Laggia + Omega + Wyvern + Chimera When Tyranno effect destroy Chimera you trigger Wyvern effect to special summon and pop  I apologize for linking to a site I shouldn't have but it was the easiest way for me to bring the combos to you, I also understand if this deck profile is removed for those same reasons.  Please comment below anything about this deck profile, I will answer them all."

Doesn't use Rafflesia + Gravedigger's Trap Hole because in my experience it's just not consistent enough- Petingcessouer locks you into Madolche summons and she's pretty much your main combo starter.  &nbsp;  A few Madolche tips I've learned that I haven't really seen anywhere else:  &nbsp;  If you have multiple different starters in your hand (Magiliene, Petingcessour, Anjelly, etc.), my favorite opening move is to tribute Anjelly for Petingcessouer. This already ensures a monster in the GY so you don't need to waste detaching a material for Glassouffle- in fact, you can go into Tiaramisu instead and really start messing up your opponent's board.  If you can get Lightning Storm to work, it's incredible, but even if you don't? Baiting a negate early on like that can be devastating. If you really want to see it do some damage, though, try combining it with Forbidden Droplet or Dark Ruler- those two cards work wonders for Evenly Matched as well.  Do not sleep on Glassouffle's secondary ability. Seriously. Hand getting thin? Recycle an Upstart or Extrav into the deck. Opponent using a lot of annoying Graveyard effects? Shuffle 'em back in. Abyss Dweller can help with that, too.  &nbsp;  I'm totally open to suggestions, especially from those more experienced in the Madolche ways."

That is why Obelisk got thrown in here, he doesn't really synergize with anything in here, and could very well be replaced by another God or any other card.  Slifer, Ra and Ra Sphere Mode are searchable by Thunderspeed Summon. Obelisk can also be summoned by Thunderspeed Summon tho, just not be searched by it.  Summoning Isolde is very easy. Use her first effect to search Infernoble Knight Renaud, and her second effect to discard an Equip Spell from your Deck to special summon Fire Flint Lady right from your deck. This allows you to special summon Renaud from your hand, and it lets you recycle the Equip Spell you just discarded. Now you have 3 monster (and an Equip Spell of your choice) which can be tributed for a god or linked away.  Magnum Shield allows even your normal monsters to become quite the beat sticks. I even used it on Idaten the Conqueror Star and Arcana Knight Joker. But there are a lot of options for Equip Spells, so choose whatever you want.  If Ra is summoned using Ancient Chant and the three Knights as tribute fother, Ra will start out with a whopping 5000 Atk.  Be aware that the recycle effect of all the Poker cards can also be activate be returning a Warrior Extra Deck monster back to the Extra Deck. This allows you to easily summon multiple Isolde and Arcana Extra joker per duel.  &nbsp;"

It can be found here, please take a look at it, it's an awesome deck:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/mae/"">Mae</a>  Like Mae's original deck, this one too is all about summoning ""<a data-name=""Rose Tentacles"">Rose Tentacles</a>"" and destroying lot's of Rose Tokens with it, while putting out some additional damage with ""<a data-name=""Seed Cannon"">Seed Cannon</a>"". The Sunavalon Linkmonsters help summoning as many Rose Tokens as possible in one go. ""<a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a>"" can be used to search every monster in the deck while ""<a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a>"" serves as your searcher for ""<a data-name=""Black Garden"">Black Garden</a>"". It also combos with ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" for a field wipe.  This deck is of course a fun 'n' casual only deck and probably not as good as Mae's original. But it's still very enjoyable to play, so I thought I'd share it with you people.  &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

It's fairly consistent and brought me much fun in the past.  Also: Edge.,"I always loved Yami Bakura's ""Occult"" deck, using one of the first alternative win conditions: The Destiny Board. All the hilarious censoreships aside, I think it's still until this very day one of the most fun ways to win a duel. I couldn't really find an at least halfway consistant Spirit Message deck which I liked, so I decided to make my own. Anyway, let's get right to my deck.  The way to go and all around goal of the deck is; obviously; bring out all Spirit Message letters and win via the effect of ""<a data-name=""Destiny Board"">Destiny Board</a>"". A very early version I used of it, consisted of just a bunch of stalling cards which definetely is a way to go but a rather inefficient one in my opinion. Trying to get out ""<a data-name=""Curse Necrofear"">Curse Necrofear</a>"" as well as her sister ""<a data-name=""Dark Necrofear"">Dark Necrofear</a>"" as soon as possible and then recycle them with ""<a data-name=""Dark Spirit of Malice"">Dark Spirit of Malice</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Dark Spirit of Banishment"">Dark Spirit of Banishment</a>"" everytime they die is a way better way to go and offers another legitimate winning strategy besides the Spirit Messages. That is of course no reason to not put at least a bit of stall into the mix. ""<a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a>"" is of course a good way to skip an attack from your opponent. ""<a data-name=""Tour Guide From the Underworld"">Tour Guide From the Underworld</a>"" also helps to quickly summon monsters from the extra deck like ""<a data-name=""Number 48: Shadow Lich"">Number 48: Shadow Lich</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a>"" which help you keeping up your defense, while ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"" (with a bit of luck) also keeps your defense up against incoming attacks. Keep in mind that you gotta make your choice if you have Battle Fader in your hand and also Dark Sanctuary on the field. You can only go with one, if you decide to activate Dark Sanctuary once the opponent attacks you, you cannot use Battle Fader for that attack anymore. All around I recommend to always make use of your Battle Fader(s) first and use Dark Sanctuary only as the last possibility.  As for the side deck, I really only go with ""<a data-name=""Draw of Fate"">Draw of Fate</a>"", using it only rarely as a side option when I feel like it since it's a kinda good card for the deck but has a huge downside as well.  &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

Additional Zexal support is included for either board control, sapping resources from the deck (in the case of Time Thief Redoer) or building a line of defense. Furthermore, Forbidden Droplet and Dark Ruler No More is included to shut down opportunities for the opponent to retaliate (since the Arcana Knights have a lot of recycle ability now due to Joker's Knight, Joker's Wild, and Joker's Straight). The same goes for other counter tools like Solemn Strike.  &nbsp;  This deck doesn't really support Slifer very well, but Ra works in this just fine. I was running Mound of the Bound Creator before in the main deck, but i decided to move it to a side deck option since Ra and Sphere Mode are really secondary strategies in this deck due to how restrictive they are."

For the agents their new link monster is super helpful as it freely sends Majesty Hyperion from your deck to the graveyard and then if you link it off and banish it you just just got a free boss with no minus. Their new synchro monster is also pretty neat and it’s a tuner as well so halq can summon it. Their new spell is awesome too but I skipped it in this build.  The Despia support is sick as well, the new branded spells are amazing, their new monster is a useful extender, and the new dragon is actually really good for it’s revival and sheer burn that just makes it super pressuring, I’m not disappointed with this support at all and at this rate this deck might actually be super viable in the near future."

While there are plenty of decks out there that utilize Dragon Rulers I feel none of them take advantage of their true potential which is abusing the graveyard and generating unmatched searching power through their best friend Eclipse Wyvern, not to just summon themselves and draw 4 to 5 cards at the end of the turn. This deck builds the nastiest of boards in a consistent basis despite being a 60 card deck because you could literally dump 30+ cards in one turn to the graveyard then go bonkers reviving them and linking them off etc. Anyways I hope you have fun ruining someone else's life playing the baddest of decks ever created hehehe"

Nothing special here.,"<h1>Main Deck Monster - 14</h1> <h5>3x Rescue Cat</h5> Main and best Starter of the deck. Since the send to GY is cost, if it get's ashed, you can Gamma the ash. Be aware of the errata! Most cheaper Rescue Cat Cards are pre-errata and don't state, that the effects of the summoned monsters are negated. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Fraktall</h5> Searchable with Tenki. Also your Starter. 1900 ATK is also nice sometimes. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Kitt</h5> Cat Target &amp; extender. It's great to keep a Kitt in Hand for a follow-up next turn or to discard off Twin Twister or Forbidden Droplet in your opponents turn. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Nervall</h5> Extender &amp; Searcher. Don't burn through them! Only use them, if you're able to use the search effect! <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Kerass</h5> Cat Target and can sometimes unbrick your hand. SS him and discard Kitt or Nervall, and you're good to go. I usually don't really want to have him in my starting hand but rather search him of Nervall. That's why only 2. If you would play Pot of Desires, then I would put him to 3. <h1>Hand Traps - 14 + Driver</h1> Always adapt to the current meta. You have so many space for them... <h5>2x D.D. Crow</h5> If you hit the correct card, it can be really strong. Sometimes it's just nice to have an additional Winged Beast in your GY. Sometimes it comes up, that you have Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle on the field and the opponent has 2 monsters in GY. So D.D. Crow enables the 4800 ATK of Doom Eagle.  Since it's searchable of Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen, you can also put it to 1. <h5>3x Ash Blossom</h5> Still the most versatile hand trap. <h5>3x Ghost Belle</h5> Hits all the current meta decks quite good, especially in a mirror match. So I started to main deck it. <h5>3x PSY-Frame Gamma + 1x Driver</h5> All your starters can be protected by gamma (Cat, Fraktall, Tenki).  Sometimes you can hit a badly timed Artifact Lancea.  Sometimes you can protect a crucial Revolt, when you don't have any monsters on field and it get's ghost belle'd. Just keep in mind, with gamma &amp; driver on the field, you're only able to summon a max link 3, if you don't have a correctly summoned Ferrijit in your GY.  With cards like Ferrijit, Bearbrumm, Double Dragon Lord, Forbidden Droplet &amp; Twin Twister, you have enough usage for dead cards like driver or offline gamma's. <h5>3x Infinite Impermanence</h5> It's really strong in the mirror match. It can't get Gamma'd. Can be beneficial to turn off Floodgates for a turn like Summon Limit.  <strong>For Budget Players: </strong>1:1 replacement would be Effect Veiler. But I would rather recommend playing something like Pot of Desires at 3. <h1>Spell Cards - 7</h1> <h5>3x Fire Formation - Tenki</h5> Searcher for Fraktall. Bait for Ash. Can be later used for Forbidden Droplet or Double Dragon Lord. <h5>2x Forbidden Droplet</h5> The only money card i'm running since I pulled it from the display.  Great going 1st and 2nd. Just set it going 1st and use a dead Apollousa, Tenki or any card that's currently resolving (like Revolt).  Going 2nd, obviously shut down the opponents main threats. If you discard a Nervall or Kitt, you're starting your play at the same moment. That's why I love this card in this deck.  <strong>For Budget Players</strong>: 1:1 replacement is Dark Ruler No More. But it's only usable going 2nd. I would recommend also playing Monster Reborn &amp; Foolish Burial as a extender &amp; starter. Or just use more Hand Traps. After all, why not. <h5>1x Harpie's Feather Duster</h5> I like main decking it, since there are a lot of Subterror and Altergeist players around. Oh and it's your only out to Mystic Mine... <h5>1x Called by the Grave</h5> Main defence against hand traps. Please come back to 3 :( <h1>Traps - 4 (+ 3 Imperm)</h1> Infinite Impermanence is already described in the hand trap section. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Revolt</h5> The reason, why Tri-Brigade is currently Tier 1. Summons a 3k body with a untarget banish, and is a search, and can recover some banished ressources. Busted.  A lot of people run it at 2 since you're able to search it. But I don't mind drawing into this card. If I already have Revolt in my hand, I can playout my turn differently and don't have to rely on Bearbrumm. <h5>1x Imperial Order</h5> Stops more from the opponent that from yourself. Stops so many strong board-breaking staples. Decks like Sky Striker can give up the duel right away. <h1>Extra Deck</h1> I don't own Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder. If I would, I would definitely look for a way, to play him. He's just so stupidly strong. <h5>3x Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</h5> Main Beater. Untarget Banish. Searcher if in GY. Just an all around good card. Play it at least at 2. I only play it at 3 because I have the extra deck space for it. <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller</h5> Probably the weirdest choice to play at 2. But I actually really like playing him, when I realize it's going to be a grind match. He + Shuraig enables a untarget banish in the opponents main phase. And I play him at 2 because sometimes you need to go into him with a bad start hand in order to link away Ferijit or Bearbrumm. And I have the extra deck space for it. <h5>2x Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</h5> He's really important when you play cat, since you always go into him after the cat summons. That's why I like him at 2. Important: if you correctly linked summoned him of cat's summons, you're able to summon him of revolt to give you an additional draw! <h5>1x Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager</h5> Revolt searcher. That's it. And that's why I only play him at 1. I played him a long time on 2, but I almost never go into him more than once. The second effect comes up sometimes, if I know the opponent doesn't have an interruption and I want to fully commit to my 1st turn board. <h5>1x Topologic Zeroboros</h5> This should be Accesscode Talker if I had one. This slot is just for a good finisher. Zeroboros can get really big the longer the duel goes and can also wipe the field, if you manage to summon a monster in a link area he points to and then go for game in the turn after.  The reason why I budget-picked him over the classic Accesscode replacement Borrelsword Dragon is, that Zeroboros only needs 2+ monster like Accesscode (Tri-Brigade + banish 3 --&gt; Zeroboros), while Borrelsword needs 3+ monsters... <h5>1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</h5> Your main going 1st end monster. Usually with 3 negates (2400 ATK) + a set revolt. <h5>1x Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle</h5> Super strong against Drytron, since you can spell speed 2 shuffle back a card from gy.  Can get really beefy, if the opponent doesn't have a monster in GY to finish.  But usually, I'm using him to go into Zeroboros. <h5>1x Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords</h5> Cheap and amazing disruptor. For his effect, you also can use Tenki on the field, or Kitt / Nerval in Hand to extend any play. <h5>1x PSY-Framelord Lambda</h5> The classic card if you main deck PSY-Frame Gamma and have some extra space in your extra deck. Can be anything you want... I just like to go into it, if I have already monsters on the board but a live Gamma in my hand. <h5>1x Salamangreat Almiraj</h5> Unbricker of your hand. If you don't have any starters in your hand, but a Kit or a Nervall, you can send them to the GY to start from there. <h5>1x PSY-Framelord Omega</h5> It comes up quite often, that you can Gamma in your own turn. So a target for that is important. <h1>Side Deck</h1> Nothing special here. Just adjust to the meta. The following Side Deck is built to hit Drytron, Mirror Match (Tri-Brigade), Sky Striker, Virtual World and over all Backrow Heavy Decks, since a lot of Rogue Decks are quite Trap Heavy. <h5>2x Alpha, the Master of Beasts &amp; 1x Dinowrestler Pankratops</h5> Your going 2nd cards. I don't like to main deck any of them. <h5>3x Artifact Lancea</h5> Strong in the Mirror Match. Strong against VW. Can also stop Invoked. <h5>3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird</h5> A must against Drytron, your worst matchup. Maybe catch some Dragon Link variants... But mainly in the side against Drytron. Can also hit Meltdown or Nadir Servant in a Invoked Dogmatika. <h5>3x Twin Twister</h5> Strong against any backrow heavy decks. Force an early Revolt in the mirror match. <h5>2x Anti-Spell Fragrance</h5> Hits almost any deck when you can go 1st. If you're going second, it can still be strong against Sky Striker &amp; Drytron. <h5>1x Red Reboot</h5> I hate Altergeist. And a lot of Rogue Variants of any deck is running a lot of staple traps. And Solemn Strike is arguably the strongest trap card."

It uses synchro summoning to access the extra deck. Therefore it uses zombie tuners with the dark attribute. This attribute is key for the only non-zombie synchro summon. This summons the <a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a> which is the highest level synchro summon and the only monster with the light attribute. This is not the most powerful monster in my deck though. The most powerful summons I can utilize are the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a> in combination with the <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> field spell. This makes all monsters on the field or in either graveyard a zombie. Each zombie-type monster in either graveyard adds 100 ATK to the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>. That's not all. When the regular <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</a> destroys a zombie-type monster and sends it to the graveyard, you can special summon that monster on your side of the field. Since <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> makes all monsters zombies, this applies to the opponents non-zombie monsters as well."

mothman, there are many ways you can have that extra special summon  7-then with winder and that extra monster special summon time thief perpetua, and use her effect to attach time thief flyback from deck to time thief redoer  8-then set the time thief retrograde that you searched  9-during the next opponent's turn standby phase, use both redoer and perpetua to snatch a card off of the opponents deck to get a peak on what they are playing assuming you went first, and special summon winder with perpetua's eff ideally in DEF mode, and search either another time thief retrograde or another time thief regulator to redo this entire combo in case something happened to your board  this was a one card combo, that the entire deck is inspired from it, and if you don't get time thief regulator in hand at first turn, you can still just summon redoer and set the many trap cards that you would probably drawn, if not, than you would have drawn a lot of monsters that will let you summon perpetua as well  the three top extra deck cards i find myself summoning, are redoer, perpetua, and tornado dragon, which gives me a firm control of both the monsters with redoer's spinning eff, and the S/T with tornado dragon, while perpetua provides the materials to do all that  <strong>instructions :</strong>  the main deck monsters are chosen so they would cover the 3 special summoning speeds, speed 1 : special summon while you control nothing (evil swarm mandragora + Danger mothman!+ The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine) , speed 2 : special summon while you control a monster (raidraptor - strangle lanius + time thief adjuster + raider's wing) + speed 3 : is committing to the normal summon which includes all of them  don't always seek to summon zues, zues is a powerful card that should only be used as a last resort, and even before zues, you have evilswarm exciton knight to do the same thing basically  for most games you would be okay just by summoning redoer, perpetua, and tornado dragon, but if you need more or a different type of control, cards like abyss dweller and evilswarm nightmare are available  while facing annoying decks that want to limit your number of monsters, like mystic mine for example, or if you want to unclog your field for some reason, link summon black luster soldier, but while facing mystic mine in particular it is good to have only redoer, because he can escape the field when mystic mine activates, leaving the field empty and mystic mine will self destruct at the end phase  people will want to negate redoer, so if that happens, the best thing is to catch them offguard by using him as a material for vespenato, a piercer with 2500 atk  and if you are facing deck that rely on heavy hitters with big amounts of ATK, then you have utopia the lightning, and arc rebellion xyz dragon, the latter should be reserved to punish the opponent if they commit too much to the board  <strong>final thoughts :</strong>  all and all, practice makes perfect, this deck is so fun, but could be better with each duelist's personal touch, and some support if konami ever remembers time thieves, personally, i would love to see a ROTA for the deck, to increase the chances of getting time thief regulator, and a time thief that would cover special summon speed 1 and 2, with an effect of (if you control no monsters, or if all monster you control are ""Time Thief""  special summon this card from your hand) and it can have a quirky quick effect to tribute itself for a reason, since a lot of time thieves does that, but at the end, i love the deck as it is, and i hope konami remember this unfinished archetype with amazing potential (calm down red-eyes players .. i know you cringe when you hear the word ""potential"" )"

You should always try to bring out your link 2 monster or if you can link 3 monster  evil eye monster since their cost for activating effect only applies to monster on your link zones so if you don't have any monsters on those zones its just 500 atk buff.  So, as for the combo it's simple you want to have serziel or the field spell  so we can search serziel or basilius on our starting hand while serziel being the best, we play 3 of evil eye of selene so we don't have to search it often also, we want to have some extra any evil eye cards for the combo.  The combo is you summon serziel you search for basilius if you don't have it but if you do add evil eye of reemergance  to go into link 3 if you also have evil eye selene, then use basilius effect to send eye of gorgoneio to grave then use gorgoneio effect to discard any  evil eye card  the add any evil eye card you need based on what you have and what you want. Then link summon evil eye empress or ruler of evil eye if you have reemergance then equip evil eye selene.  &nbsp;"

Sky Scourges are few but they are also extremely powerful when hitting the field.  I’ve made this before and it’s super funny to pull off, the best part is that you can also add in a domain lock for GGs  In my opinion this is the most bricky form of monarch but also the most powerful when it goes through."

It is a very standard GOAT Control list, that is teched out to play against Chaos decks.  The main strategy of the deck is to control your opponent with the help of Scapegoat and Thousand-Eyes Restrict and generate advantage with your power spells like Pot of  Greed (even tho I don't exactly know what it does) in combination with Magician of Faith until you beat your opponent.  To some card choices:  I have chosen not to play Morphing Jar. It benefits my opponent (a Chaos deck player) more than me, and I think it is in general too unpredictable.  I would LOVE to include the Phoenix package into the deck, as you can see in the extra deck, but it isn't strong enough against Chaos.  To Exarion:  There is a controversy about if one should include Exarion into the GOAT Format or not. For me, I don't play Exarion, but I don't mind if my opponent does.  The side deck can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"
