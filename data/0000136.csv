I also added in Dragonmaid Sheou, and House Dragonmaid for The Dragonmaid oriented games where you need more heavy hitters and you can then throw Dragonmaid Ernus or Nudyarl on the field for immunity to card effects!

Use Skill Prisoner to protect your Toon Kingdom of any monsters target effect during 2 turns this may help you in OTK and you will have Toon Bookmarks on graveyard to help you to protect Toon Kingdom too and Toon Terror to negate any effect that doesn't target Toon Kingdom.  &nbsp;  You use your Extra Deck just to use the effect of Pot of Extravagance but if you want you can tribute 2 Toon Luster Soldier to XYZ summon Number 38 or 2 level 7 monsters to XYX summons Number 11 Big Eye but the biggest purpose of extra deck is for Pot Extravagance.

Remus/Dragon Ravine is a Chaos Ruler turbo without normal summon and it can dig for the Monarchs/Majesty. Ehther can summon,"https://youtu.be/jeWmIC-By3o  Weird, but works! Basic idea is to provide consistency to Monarch, Remus just happen to be one of the best for it. Use Remus add Ravine, use Ravine discard 1 add Legatus, ss Legatus, ss Remus from GY, make Gae Dearg, use Gaedearg add Baby Roc and discard it, ss Baby Roc, make Chaos Ruler and mill for 5, fetch anything you lack (preferably Majesty's Fiend or Dark Simorgh, then handtrap/the Danger! if you want). If starts from Ravine we will negs harder, add Remus, use Remus add 2nd Ravine, use Ravine add Legatus, and continue like normal.  The rest is just consistency card like Danger! (Dogman is the best cus 2400/1000 stats, Nessie can fetch Dogman, Jackalope thins our deck), we dont run Tsuchinoko tho as if its discarded it wont thin our deck (we need to thin the deck for better Chaos Ruler mill/Pantheism draw). Domain will be active if we used those Gae Dearg and Chaos Ruler. We dont run Monarch Erupt as it negates Dark Simorgh and it's not good against Virtual World, Drytron, or Eldlich. Kuraz is there for more draw as we can pop our Ravine. Return of the Monarchs makes any of our tribute summon a lock (adds Ehther, summon during opponent's turn, ss Dark Simorgh/Kuraz, u can also run Seleglare for bounce).  Dark Simorgh is super clutch here, as it can ss itself from hand/GY (if we have DARK and WIND), Ehther can summon it too during our opponent's turn to lock them from setting trap which is super popular right now. Chaos Ruler benefits from DARK and LIGHT attribute to ss itself from GY, making us wont lack big beater for damage.  Pros: Better consistency, more locks (extra deck, monster activation, and cant set cards).  Cons: Monarch sucks, plenty of flaws.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

I beat the shit out of Toon with this, so ask her. Anyway, deck guide.</span><span> </span><span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Alpha- Alpha is a key combo piece of the deck, as if you didnât open Benten (your main playmaker), you can use Alpha to search it anyways and use Benten as fodder for more Drytrons, so you can get enough to go into Aura. </span><span> </span><span>3x Delta- Delta is the deckâs main source of draw power, as it gives a small draw 1. While the draw 1 is minor, it can easily top deck a Drytron to extend your plays. Deltaâs main âcostâ is minor, as your opponent can expect what youâll use if youâre playing Drytrons.</span><span> </span><span>2x Zeta- Zeta mainly just serves to get onto the field, as fodder for Aura. Zeta can also search the Ritual spell on occasion if you need it, although this deck doesnât always need/want the ritual spell.</span><span> </span><span>1x Gamma- Gamma is mainly used just to revive used up Drytrons mid- to late game, as this provides a ton more monsters on field and a ton of advantage for small cost.</span><span> </span><span>3x Diviner- Diviner is one of the deckâs main playmakers. You want to use your normal summon on Diviner, and then use Divinerâs effect to send Trias. Trias then tributes Diviner in the grave to special summon itself, which activates Divinerâs effect to special summon Sprite. You then go into Union Carrier, and then send Union to grave or banish it somehow. Union Carrier should be equipped with Dawn Knight, so DawnÂ  Knight sends Eva, which gets back Diviner. Then youâll use Drytrons to go into Auraradon to make a ton of tokens. Then you use Diviner/D.D sprite and the Tokens to turbo into some huge Synchros.</span><span> </span><span>1x D.D Sprite- D.D Sprite is mainly to be searched off of Diviner for Union and/or Synchro plays, but if you opened it, you can use it to banish Union to activate Dawn Knight. </span><span> </span><span>1x Trias- Trias is a huge garnet in hand, as you need it in the deck at all times for Divinerâs effect. While it is in the deck though, you can use Diviner to send it so Trias tributes Diviner, special summoning Trias and activating Divinerâs effect. After that, Trias is mainly fodder for Union Carrier.</span><span> </span><span>1x Dawn Knight- Dawn Knight is mainly a garnet in hand, although it can be used, but you want it to be in deck so you have more space in hand for combo plays. Dawn Knight is mainly equipped to Union so when Union is sent off the field, Dawn Knight can send Eva to extend your plays.</span><span> </span><span>1x Eva- You also mainly want to keep Eva in deck (holy shit why is this deck running so many garnets), to send it to grave off of Dawn Knight. Once itâs sent later in the combo, Eva can be used to give you another Diviner, as a tuner. </span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- Ash is mainly just a staple hand trap in the deck, as it provides key negates during the opponentâs turn so they canât do shit.</span><span> </span><span>1x Draconids- Draconids is rarely of much use, aside from being tributed. Although, when going second on some occasions, Draconids can be a huge beater with some strong interruption.</span><span> </span><span>2x Herald- Herald is a nice ritual to end off on, as it can tribute Union to activate Dawn, and Herald is a great source of negates to couple with things like Borreload. </span><span> </span><span>3x Benten- Benten is also one of the deckâs key combo pieces, as you want to burn through the copies and tribute them for the Drytrons. If you didnât open Diviner, you can easily search Diviner with Benten, which is fantastic. </span><span> </span><span>1x Aratron- Aratron is mainly just fodder for being tributed, although in some occasions it can be summoned off of Union and Meteonis. It can also be summoned with Phul if you feel like it and have the extra resources. Aratronâs mainly just used for an extra layer of protection.</span><span> </span><span>1x Phul- Phul is mainly not summoned, but if you do summon it, you can use it to get back stuff like Benten to extend your plays. Additionally, while Phul is in hand, it mainly serves to be tributed, but can be used to summon Aratron in some key situations.</span><span> </span><span>3x Fafnir- Fafnir mainly is just used for searching out Nova, as Nova gets a body on field for no cost. Although, Fafnir can also be used to search Meteonis if you need to search Meteonis at the time. Fafnir also gives an extra layer of protection to your Ritual summons, which is, kinda useless in this deck.</span><span> </span><span>3x Nova- Nova is hugely important in this deck, as it easily gets out a Drytron body onto the field with no cost. Nova is also heavily searchable, as Fafnir is an extra 3 copies of it, basically.</span><span> </span><span>1x Meteonis- Meteonis is just ran at one because of how heavily searchable and recyclable it is. Anyway, Meteonis is mainly just used to summon Herald off of Union Carrier, which activates Dawn Knightâs search to send Eva and extend your plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Cyber Emergency- Cyber Emergency is another big searcher for the deck, as it gets you all the Drytrons that you need for no cost, which is amazing in the current game.</span><span> </span><span>3x Preprep- Preprep is mainly used to search out Benten and the Megaliths if you need to get them, and it can recycle Meteonis in very, very specific and rare situations. </span><span> </span><span>The Extra Deck</span>  <span>2x Herald- Arc Light Herald mainly serves to be sent off of Diviner in some situations, if you donât need to send Trias (as Trias can tribute from hand as well). So Herald can search out your ritual monsters (namely Benten) and Meteonis, whichever you need at the time, whenever itâs sent.</span><span> </span><span>2x Crocosaur- Crocosaur is mainly a beeg synchro that can grow to huge stats, since this deck easily gains its advantage back and gets tons of cards in hand. Crocosaur gives a great source of draw power, as he can be an easy draw 2 if you use 2 tokens or whatever. </span><span> </span><span>2x Borrel- Borrel is the deckâs main boss monster, at the end of the day. Since you can tribute Union and Aurarodoan for a ritual, you can dump tons of Link monsters into the grave. This gives Borrel a ton of targets to equip and gain tons of counters (namely 3 with Aura), so you get 3 negates and a big beater. </span><span> </span><span>2x Crystal Wing- Crystal Wing is a pretty strong beater as a going second and first option, as if youâre playing against a monster heavy deck, Crystal negates literally all of their monster negates and grows Crystal into a huge beater. Additionally, Crystal is capable of gaining evenÂ  m o r eÂ  attack to finish off games easily.</span><span> </span><span>2x Halqi- Halqi is one of the deckâs key playmakers, as you can use Sprite and a Drytron or whatever to make Halqi, and use Halqi to summon Diviner way easier than whatÂ  I entailed earlier (yes, I forgot about Halqi). Halqi also serves to be sent off for a Ritual summon with Meteonis, as itâs a machine and a Link that can be equipped by a Borrel youâll eventually make. </span><span> </span><span>2x Auraradon- The monster I canât spell the name of, Syyeyesnyewyws is mainly used by going into it with 3 Drytrons, as this deck is geared towards being able to shit out 3 Drytrons. (You can allso use 1 Drytron and Halqifibrax, since itâs a Machine. You donât even have to tribute halqi to get it into the grave.) Aura then shits out 3 tokens, which you use with Diviner to go into Borreload and other huge Synchros. From there, you tribute the remaining tokens for plays, and tribute Aura for a Ritual. Then you equip it from grave to Borrel.</span><span> </span><span>1x Union- Union is mainly summoned by using Trias and a D.D sprite or something like that. Union then equips Dawn Knight from deck. Youâll want to tribute/send off Union, with a ritual or something like that, to activate Dawn Knightâs search. Dawn Knight sends Eva, and Eva searches out another Diviner.</span><span> </span><span>1x Nâtss- Nâtss is mainly just there to be sent off of Diviner when going second, for a nice, simple pop. It can also be used to counter that one big Dogmatika thing in certain match ups.</span><span> </span><span>1x VFD- Yeah, I hate myself too. VFD is just here as a âBreak glass in case of emergencyâ card, as you can make it sometimes with Crocosaur and also Trias. VFD is rarely summoned and just there for certain, very certain situations.</span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span>  <span>This deck is surprisingly strong for one that runs several fucking garnets. At first, youâll want to do theÂ  usual Drytron plays; tribute Benten to get out at least 1 Drytron on field, and then burn through all your Benten copies until you search out a Diviner. From there, normal summon Diviner and use Diviner to either A) Send Trias if you didnât open it, or B) Send Herald if you opened Trias. Weâre gonna be going with A here, since itâs the most likely. Now that Trias is in grave, you use itâs effect to tribute Diviner and special summon itself. Divinerâs on tribute effect activates, summoning D.D Sprite directly from deck. Sprite and Trias are then linked off into Halq, and Halq summons Diviner. You then use Halq and at least 1 Drytron to go into Auradon. Auradon shits out tons of tokens, which Diviner synchros with into huge shit like Borreload. You then tribute the Halq and Aura off for a Ritual, and then use Borreload to equip Aura from grave to get 3 counters on it. </span><span> </span><span>This deck is stupid, idiotic, and has no consistency, and I love it. Have a good day.</span><span> </span>"

I think these are the best cards for it without changing the way its played but if anybody e,"Search for pacifis with pot of extravagance or upstart goblin or directly search it with terraforming or metaverse then summon megalomasher or gagagigo using unexpected dai or fossil dig. Use skill drain and cold wave to prevent your opponent from playing the game and sea stealth attack to protect pacifis/skill drain or power up phantasm spiral itself. If the opponent is a threat add phantasm spiral traps to stop them and if not add the equip spells (grip) to power up your monsters and special summon as many dragons as your opponent has monsters as long as you can keep destroying them. Either all that or: normal summon, equip spell, attack, dragon go brrrrrr, and win the game."

Dark World variant with some OTK and lockdown potential,"I love the concept of the Danger! Dark World deck and decided to try my hand at building my own version of it. Got some ideas from this deck, mainly the ideas for some of the extra deck setups: https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-world-danger-december-2020/  I also wanted to add an explanation of why I included each card for both your purposes if you wanna use/modify this and my own if you'd like to give me some feedback with my reasonings in mind.  This is my first time posting a deck I built so if you have any suggestions or critiques let me know! :D  <b>Monsters:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Beiige: Iâve seen other decks run a single Beiige and work well, but I think this setup in particular has some really good Beiige synergy down the line, particularly with Charge Into a Dark World for setting up your Rank 4 XYZ summon (Utopia line) or the Knightmare link monsters to start breaking your opponentâs board</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Broww: A staple here, just gives you more cards when heâs discarded, which is especially nice when done via Dark Deal to get the extra card</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Snoww: Your Dark World searcher, can also disrupt your opponentâs GY when paired with Dark Deal which is useful against GY combo-oriented decks like Thunder or Chaos</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Grapha: Used to run 2, but his effect is just too powerful and his ability to cycle himself out of the GY while also giving you another use of a Dark Worldâs discard effect is way too good to pass up on. GY cycling in particular gives him a lot of use bringing out the powerful Rank 8 XYZ summons (of which there are plenty to choose from), giving him even more utility here</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Bigfoot: Excellent all around with board breaking, Level 8 synergy with Trade-In, and just being an easy-to-summon powerhouse at 3k attack. Obvious pick for playsetting</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Chupacabra: A little less obvious of a playset pick, but I think Chupacabra synergizes more with this deck than others Iâve seen of this type given that heâs a Fiend and can be pulled back from the grave OR discarded with Charge, giving you an additional avenue of firing off his powerful GY effect.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Mothman: Just lets you get more cards and discard effects, easy playset</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Nessie: Either a powerful defender, link fodder, or more discard effects</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Ogopogo: This might seem like a weird pick to only run 1 of given how many Rank 8 XYZs Iâm running, but I think keeping in the traps as protection for going first is worth the trade-off. Ogopogo is here particularly to synergize with Danger! Response Team, since its GY effect lets you get both a Danger! discard effect and an extra draw</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Thunderbird: Basically the same as Bigfoot without being as big of a powerhouse and board breaking in a different way, still an easy playset pick</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Jackalope: Donât know if I need to explain this one, excellent for grabbing XYZ or link material</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Tsuchinoko: Same as Jackalope but he uses himself, also heâs a fat snake. Easy include for that alone</span></li> </ul> <b>Spells:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Card Destruction: Any Danger! Dark World deck should be playing this card</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Charge Into a Dark World: I alluded to it before but this card has great synergy with both Beiige and Chupacabra, and Skull Meister if you side him in. Since it doesnât specify Dark World, you can use it with any Fiend, letting you get at least one special summon and whatever discard effect you want. It unfortunately doesnât synergize with other Danger! monsters besides Chupacabra, but I think it provides enough reliable XYZ or link setup to be worth it</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Danger! Response Team: Works incredible well with Ogopogo and lets you recycle it into the deck while drawing a card and getting another Danger! discard effect. Also just has a really good primary effect if you need to get rid of an opponentâs targetable monster that canât be destroyed by effects or is too strong for your hand to deal with</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Pot of Avarice: Easy pick with so many monster discards</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Super Poly: Opponent board breaking, discard effect (only for Danger! monsters since it discards as cost), getting Starving Venom or Mudragon. Whatâs not to love here?</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Trade-In: I play a lot of good Level 8s here with strong discard effects, so this is a great pick for both getting those powerful effects and getting more cards to work with</span></li> </ul> <b>Traps:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x Dark Deal: I donât see this card too often in these decks and I think it should be. The main weakness of a lot of Danger! Dark World decks is that theyâre really bad at going first, but this card helps mitigate that by denying the opponent a normal Spell card while giving you access to the more powerful discard effects, like getting two cards from Broww or breaking GY monster combos with Snoww</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Another way to stave off the problems with going first, this card actually has great synergy with Grapha. Since Grapha can bring himself back from the GY and recycle Dark World discard effects simultaneously, heâs the obvious pick for EEVâs tribute cost. Iâve won entire duels with this card alone and I think it puts in the work to justify being here</span></li> </ul> <b>Extra:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Mudragon: Super Poly target, lets you stave off targeting enemy effects when you change him to Dark</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: The staple Super Poly target</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Dingirsu: Really powerful Rank 8, excellent both on his own and as a setup into Seven Sins. Gets removal when heâs first summoned that avoids enemy effects that happen on destruction and has built-in survival if youâre planning to use him on his own</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 84: Pain Gainer: Not much to talk about with him besides being ranking material into Seven Sins</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 77: Seven Sins: Incredible beatstick that can just wipe an opponentâs entire field. Gets around cards that canât be destroyed or targeted since itâs a non-targeting banish and will have plenty of survival if you didnât use any of Dingirsu or Pain Gainerâs material effects. The only issue is heâll need to stay on the field for a turn to use his banish effect, since he canât use it turn one if heâs summoned through rank-up, but thatâs not too tough since his survival effect isnât once per turn and heâll have anywhere from 1-4 uses of it</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 97: Draglubion: This guyâs your setup into the OTK if you can get it. Use him to special summon Number 100 with Number C92 as its material and fire off 100âs effect for a min. 9k attacker. If the combo gets disrupted or you canât quite get the OTK off, Draglubion also works as Pain Gainer-&gt;Seven Sins fodder if he can survive a turn after using his effect</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 100: Numeron Dragon: The pick youâll probably want for Draglubionâs special summon, enables quick OTKs especially if you have more than just Draglubion on the field (like if you got Seven Sins or the Rank 4 setup earlier), can swing over just about any monster your opponent can summon, very strong pick overall</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number C92: Heart-eartH Chaos Dragon: Material to attach to Number 100 with Draglubion. His effect doesnât really work unless he has the specific monster listed on his card as material, so the only thing heâs good for being summoned on his own is heâs unable to be destroyed by battle and he makes your monsters siphon LP when they do battle damage. If your opponentâs run out of other removal options or youâre super low on LP and can get some good hits in this might not be the worst pick, but if you can get good hits in youâre probably in a better spot to just win with Number 100</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy: Another possible pick for Draglubion, his lockdown on enemy Spell cards is insanely effective and makes him a great choice if you canât get the OTK or see your opponent has some reliance on Spell cards. He can also change an opponentâs attack target, which makes him good at keeping a weaker field member alive like a Level 4 you need a turn to XYZ</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Utopia/Utopia Prime/Utopia the Lightning: The Rank 4 line I use, this is an incredibly strong setup that can easily swing over whatever your opponent might have. Lightningâs effect actually makes it a Dragoon counter since your opponent canât use effects until the end of the Damage Step, so they canât negate Lightningâs jump to 5000 ATK. A great powerhouse thatâs incredibly easy to set up with this deck</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: This card is a personal favorite of mine. Getting Apollousa and Hope Harbinger out on the field at the same time is an incredibly effective lockdown on your opponent. Her negates are limited based on how many materials you use to summon her, which can be annoying if your opponent has many ways to lead into their combos, but overall sheâs still a very strong pick</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Knightmare Phoenix: Easy to summon, Spell/Trap removal, and works as an engine for discard effects from your Main Deck monsters</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Knightmare Unicorn: Also easy to summon and helps get discard effects, but has the added bonus of being non-destructive removal</span></li> </ul> <b>Side:</b> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Skull Meister: GY effects are very strong in YGO today, so Skull Meister is great at staving off things like âwhen this card is destroyedâ effects and blocking your opponentâs combos. Also has good inherent synergy with this deck by being a Level 4 Fiend, meaning he can do his thing as a handtrap and then be recovered by Charge to use as link/XYZ fodder</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Sphere Mode: Enemy board removal, very good if your opponent has strong lockdown combos that require them to have a bunch of monsters on the field (something like Dragoon, Hope Harbinger, and Apollousa)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Twin Twisters: Spell/Trap removal that also triggers Danger! monster effects by discarding them</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x Infinite Impermanence: Just one of the best handtraps overall imo</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Galaxy Eyes line: This is another Rank 8 XYZ setup you can use in place of the Dragons or Seven Sins (or the link monsters if you wanna go all in on XYZ), it just felt like overkill to include all three of these in the Extra Deck when thereâs a good chance the duel will be over before you can see all three or even two of the combos. The Galaxy-Eyes setup is very powerful though and makes a strong argument for replacing one of the others, this one is just personal preference mostly</span></li> </ul>"

Myutants don't work as well with Invokeds as Dragonmaids did, but they still do work fairly well. They have a few ranging attributes to use, and Invocation banishes cards, providing more banish fodder. Deck list time. 2x Arsenal- too bricky at 3. Another one of the, like, weird evolved forms that I run at 2. Pretty good in the current meta, considering how it can dodge pog blade, imperm, and the cringe Eldlich trap line up, making Arsenal pretty solid to leave on the field. 2x Mist- i'm seeing a patttern here. I run all the weird evolved forms at 2. Mist gives instant advantage by banishing a card to draw 2 when your opponent activates a effect, which can easily turn into a plus 3 in the right situation.Â  While it's a bit slow, it's still a solid source of draw power. 2x Beast- Beast is solid. Can't be targeted by monster effects, which dodges Dragoon, Borreload, etc, which is great in the current meta Also negates spell cards by banishing cards, so it gathers advantage and can easily negate key points of the opponent's combo. 3x Aleister- Mandatory for the Invoked engine. Great searcher as well. It takes up a normal summon (sometimes), which can clash with the Myutants (sometimes), but if you open Invocation you don't even need to normal it. Aleister leads to a ton of strong fusions, namely Mechaba for a source of strong negates. 1x GB-88- I personally run 88 atÂ  1, since it's effect to special summon it is awkward and situational and can brick easily depending on the situation. Works well with Cry though. It's also fairly good late game recovery, as if it's summoned during the opponent's turn, it can be tributed to special a banished level 8 Myutant, which is great for recovering advantage and building your board. 3x ST-46- ST-46 is generally a reliable searcher for the Myutants, as it searches a spell/trap on summon.Â  If you need fusion, you can get a fusion, you can get a cry, etc. This is great for filling in the gaps in your hand and extending your plays. ST-46 also helps greatly with field swarming, as you can tribute it and banish a monster/spell/trap to special a corresponding level 8 Myutant from hand or deck, so that's great for field swarming and building up a strong board. 3x M-05- M-05 searches out all of the Myutant monsters, which is great for also filling in the gaps in your hand and extending your plays greatly, so you can build a strong board. M-05 also has the same secondary effect as ST-46, making it so you can get out two Level 8's to make a huge board. 3x Ash Blossom- ez negate 2x Ghost Ogre- ez destruction 1x Cyberstien- This deck doesn't use it's normal summon a ton, so if you don't need to normal summon an Aleister at the moment, you can normal summon a Cyberstein to cheat out Ultimus without the entire convuluted Cry process.Â  Banish/fusion fodder otherwise. 3x Magical Meltdown- Meltdown helps a lot with consistency, as you can search out Aleister if you need one. It also gives you some heavy protection onto the fusion summons, avoiding making the fusion summons into a chokepoint. 3x Myutant Evolution Lab- Da archtypel field spell. Evo lab provides an easy special summon that can free up your normal summon for Aleister or Cyber-Stein, which is great for this deck, and a small attack boost. 3x Invocation- Invocation is an amazing card, as it can use nearly any monster for the fusion, leading into tons of strong monsters like Mechaba. Additionally, this provides a ton of banish fodder, as it banishes Aleister and such. 3x Myutant Fusion- Myutant Fusion is the main archetypal fusion spell, as it allows you to provide a ton of banish fodder to go into your fusions. Additionally, if the opponent's activated a hand trap this turn (which they most likely will have considering the current game), you can banish cards from Deck or GY as well, which is amazing for turboing out fusions.The only bad part of Fusion is that it has a retarded hard once per turn on it, making it a bit annoying to use. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming is mainly used for searching out whichever field spell you need at the time, Meltdown or Evo lab. Although, if you don't need either, you can also use Terraforming to bait out hand traps. 1x Set Rotation- Set Rotation is mainly used to set your Meltdowns and Evo Lab to both player's fields (after you use the field spell plays), which is great for halting a ton of field spell relient decks. 3x Myutant Cry- Cry is amazing for getting out Ultimus on the opponent's turn if you couldn't use Fusion, as it allows you to access a ton of different points for the fusion- Banished cards (which you should have a lot of), GY, and field, so you can easily make a huge Ultimus during the opponent's turn for a ton of interruption. Although, like Fusion, Cry has a hard once per turn, meaning no double Ultimus boards that easy. 3x Trap Trick-Trap Trick is a great card for consistency, as it allows you to search out Cry easily, improving the consistency in ""turboing"" out Ultimus greatly. Extra deck 3x Ultimus- Ultimus is generally a huge beater, as 35k is a greatly above average stat line. Additionally, it has a great negate that provides more banish fodder, and generates advantage on destruction. 2x Mechaba- Mechaba is a great source of negates for the deck, as it can negate literally anything and provides a ton of graveyard set up for Cry later on. 3x Synthethis- Synethethis gives a fairly nice pop on summon, although it might not be of use, considering this is a going 1st deck. Syneththis also provides a nice pseudo-negate built in, generally a solid monster to ""rank up"" into Ultimus by fusing it during the opponent's turn, for heavy interruption. 1x Magellanica- Maggeaicialli or however you spell it is generally just a big 3k beater that helps to close off the game in mid to late game. 2x Purgatrio- Another solid beater, Purg grows to big stats to punish swarm decks and can punish things like Guru control with it's piercing damage. 2x Cocytus- Cocytus is mainly just a large, shitty wall, that can poke at the opponent and stall until you get into a better position. 1x Raijin- Built in book of moon, helps to beat over problem monsters. It can also be used to bait out negates, as you can attempt to flip over a negate monster like Borreload. Either they're forced to use up their negate on Raidjin, or have to let it go. 1x Caliga- god i love floodgates Playing guide This won't be super in depth or anything. I've done a bit of play testing, and my main strategy is fairly simple.Â  If you don't have an Aleitser, activate Meltdown to search one. If you already have one, Meltdown is just usable for Set Rotation. If you didn't activate Meltdown, or after activating Meltdown, activate Evo lab to special summon a monster. Search Evo with terraforming if you don't already have it.Â  Tribute the small special summoned Myutant (the one that's in the cage) to search either a monster or a spell, while also providing more banish fodder. Afterwards, fusion summon Synthethis using Myutant Fusion, or search a Fusion using 46 if you don't already have one. After fusion summoning Synthethis, use Invocation to get out whatever Invoked fits the current moment attribute wise. Pass turn. During your opponent's turn, activate Cry and use Synthethis to get out Ultimus much easier. Note: I didn't mention it, but throughout this, you can normal summon Cyber Stein or Aleister if neccesary. Cyber Stein is fantastic for cheating out Ultimus, or if you already have Ultimus, you can use it to get out an extra Ultimus or a Synthethis. also note you'll want to go first so you can set up Cry with Trap Trick to get into Ultimus easier. Any feedback or thoughts is appreciated in the comments. Thanks for reading this, have a good day."

But, due to a number of missing hard once-per-turns, there is a lot of room for creativity. From crazy boards full of negates to full-out hand loops, Infernity has a lot of potential.  <span>Combo</span>  So Infernity may seem a bit complicated to the average player. Most Infernity lists you see are probably going to look a lot different than this one, mainly because they have different end-goals than my list. But before you can begin to understand this list, you must know the combo. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this combo, tell me in the comments. Do note that this deck does require a bit of a brain. Depending on your opening hand and <strong>Saryuja</strong> draws, you may need to adjust the combo as you go.  So the beginning is non-linear. The first thing you need to do is get both <a data-name=""Infernity Archfiend"">Infernity Archfiend</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Necromancer"">Infernity Necromancer</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a> does a very good job at helping out at this, so you'll typically have him on-field as well by the time the combo starts. Once you have gotten the set-up, you need to hope that you opened one of the following cards: <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, <a data-name=""Charge into a Dark World"">Charge into a Dark World</a>, and/or <a data-name=""ZERO-MAX"">ZERO-MAX</a>. These reborn cards are essential to starting up the combo. If anyone knows of any other reborn cards the deck can use (note we can't use stuff like <a data-name=""Living Fossil"">Living Fossil</a> because we need the monster to be able to activate its effect and go back to the GY) then please tell me in the comments. Now with that out of the way, let's get into the actual combo. <ol>  	<li>Revive <strong>Necromancer</strong> with a reborn card, revive <strong>Archfiend</strong> from <strong>Nerco's</strong> effect</li>  	<li>Search <a data-name=""Infernity Patriarch"">Infernity Patriarch</a>, summoning him from hand</li>  	<li>Overlay into <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> using <strong>Archfiend</strong> and <strong>Patriarch</strong></li>  	<li>Revive <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Launcher"">Infernity Launcher</a></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Launcher</strong>, but do not use its effect yet</li>  	<li>Make a 4-mat <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a></li>  	<li>Now, to continue you are going to hope that you draw into another reborn card. Thankfully, with all of the searching and milling you have already done, you have a high chance of nabbing one of the 10 in your deck. This reliance on reborn cards is one of the reasons the deck still needs more support. However, the odds are in your favor</li>  	<li>Revive <strong>Necro</strong>, bring back <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and search <a data-name=""Infernity Avenger"">Infernity Avenger</a></li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Avenger</strong> through <strong>Saryuja's</strong> effect</li>  	<li>Make <strong>Saryuja</strong> again, grab another reborn</li>  	<li>Bring back <strong>Necro</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> revives <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Mirage"">Infernity Mirage</a></li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Mirage</strong> through <strong>Saryuja</strong>, tributing him for <strong>Avenger</strong> + <strong>Patriarch</strong></li>  	<li>Make <a data-name=""Hundred Eyes Dragon"">Hundred Eyes Dragon</a> using <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and <strong>Necro</strong></li>  	<li>Banish <strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Hundred Eyes</strong> effect, tributing <strong>Hundred</strong> for <strong>Necro</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <a data-name=""Infernity Barrier"">Infernity Barrier</a> 1</li>  	<li>Using <strong>Saryuja</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong>, make <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> for <a data-name=""Infernity Wildcat"">Infernity Wildcat</a></li>  	<li>Overlay <strong>Wildcat</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong> into <a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a>, bring back <strong>Mirage</strong></li>  	<li>Use <strong>Sea Dragon</strong>, <strong>Patriarch</strong>, <strong>Archfiend</strong>, and <strong>Noodle</strong> for <strong>SaryujaÂ </strong>(what you draw here doesn't really matter. If you get lucky and get another reborn card/extender you may be able to add another negate to your end board)</li>  	<li>Tribute <strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Avenger</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <strong>Barrier</strong> 2</li>  	<li>Make <strong>Hundred</strong> again using <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong>, and <strong>Archfiend </strong></li>  	<li><strong>Hundred Eyes</strong> banishing <strong>Mirage</strong>, tributing him to summon <strong>Avenger</strong> and <strong>Necro</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Wildcat</strong>, make <strong>Sea Dragon</strong>, detaching <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Mirage</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Mirage</strong> for <strong>Nerco</strong> and <strong>Avenger</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> for <strong>Archfiend</strong></li>  	<li>Search <strong>Necro</strong> 2</li>  	<li><strong>Saryuja</strong> to summon <strong>Necro</strong> 2 from hand</li>  	<li><strong>Archfiend</strong>, <strong>Necro</strong> 1 (the one that already used its effect/the one you didn't just search), <strong>Sea Dragon,</strong> and <strong>Saryuja</strong> for <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></li>  	<li><strong>Necro</strong> 2 brings back <strong>Archfiend</strong>, search <strong>Barrier</strong> 3, use them and <strong>Avenger</strong> to make <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, attaching <strong>Saryuja</strong>. While we could make a <a data-name=""Void Ogre Dragon"">Void Ogre Dragon</a> here, there isn't much of a need as <strong>Savage</strong> does everything he does. You may argue that <strong>Void Ogre</strong> destroys, but the ruling is if you negate the activation of a Spell/Trap, then the card is sent to the GY by game mechanic even if it wasn't destroyed. And since this is inferring you are going first, as the deck does going second, your opponent shouldn't have any cards on the field to begin with</li>  	<li>Send <strong>Launcher</strong> to the GY for <strong>Necro</strong> 1 and <strong>Necro </strong>2, <strong>Necro</strong> 1 for <strong>Avenger</strong>, making <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, and <strong>Necro</strong> 2 for <strong>Wildcat</strong>, making <a data-name=""Infernity Doom Archfiend"">Infernity Doom Archfiend</a> (must be in ATK Position to make your 3 <strong>Barriers</strong> live)</li> </ol> Funny enough, I think that if all of these cards were legal in Master Rule 4, the entire combo would still be possible (correct me if I'm wrong). Not that it means much, just thought it was interesting.  (Note that with an extra extender, you may be able to make that same board, but with a Void Ogre Dragon alongside it.)  <span>Ratios</span>  So a basic overview of the ratios, I won't go into full detail, just a quick brush over. So excluding the combo pieces above, we have tons of triple-axis tools, because we really need to make <strong>Cherubini</strong>. You may have noticed <a data-name=""Performapal Hip Hippo"">Performapal Hip Hippo</a>. That is for our secret meta-destroying spice, <a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a>. An <strong>E-Tele</strong> that can summon from hand, deck, or GY, meaning <strong>Hip Hippo</strong> is never a garnet, just a dead draw, and in addition to a lack of a once-per-turn clause allows you to activate all three copies in the duel, sometimes in the same turn. That should be it for the monsters. The only traps of the deck are searchable during the combo so that just leaves the spell cards. <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>, <a data-name=""Void Apocalypse"">Void Apocalypse</a>, and <a data-name=""Super Hippo Carnival"">Super Hippo Carnival</a> all help in making <strong>Cherubini</strong>. <strong>Launcher</strong> is arguably the strongest card in your deck, searchable in the combo. And the rest is your reborn cards which are essential to the combo.  Now let's talk about the Extra Deck. Everything except your bosses, <strong>Savage</strong>, <strong>Ogre</strong>, <strong>Herald</strong>, and <strong>Apollousa </strong>is set in stone. Unless you come up with a different combo, those bosses are the only things you can change. If you can think of anything better than these bosses (2 Level 8 Synchros, a Level 4 Synchro, and a Link-4 for going first) tell me in the comments.  <span>Strengths &amp; Flaws</span>  So the endboard looked pretty good. Infernity is a really fun deck to play, and there are several different combo lines you could adapt. Typically, your end board is essentially an FTK. Usually, Infernity is used as a board-building monstrosity. But don't worry, it isn't unbeatable. First of all, going second is almost a death sentence. Secondly, hand traps hurt. If your opponent fires them too early before the combo began, then you may stand a chance depending on the number of extenders you have available. But if they hit you during the combo, then you are kind of dead. Another big thing is consistency, which is why I am considering <a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>, for the consistency boost, GY set-up, and the ability to bait hand traps such as <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. As stated earlier, this deck struggles at using the meta generic staples that most other decks can. The only hand traps you can really run are sided in for when you know you are going second, or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for its ability to be set and out of your hand. Other than that, you are out of luck. Lastly, the end board isn't unbeatable. Spell Speed 4 effects such as <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> work great against your deck. The ability to simply get rid of the Attack Position Infernirty (whether through battle or those SS4 effects) on your to invalidate your <strong>Barriers</strong> and make your board worthless through a single <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>. But despite these flaws, I highly recommend the deck for anyone interested. Lots of rogue decks suffer these same weaknesses, so it shouldn't be news to most people (unless you only ever play what's meta for the current format, and never touch anything below that: which is fine too, I guess).  <span>Banlist &amp; Support</span>  So, as you may know, <a data-name=""Infernity Archfiend"">Infernity Archfiend</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Launcher"">Infernity Launcher</a> are both limited. <strong>Archfiend</strong> had literally no reason to stay on the list, been of he came to 3 you may run a second for stuff like <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> (maybe you would put in the side?). But in reality, <strong>Archfiend</strong> to 3 wouldn't really do anything.  <strong>Launcher</strong> on the other hand would raise the ceiling of the deck to hand loop 5 and sit behind 3 omni-negates, very consistently and with a lot of resilience against several hand traps, with the exception of <a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> and <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>. Those 2 can stop you in your tracks.  What about the support? You may have noticed that <a data-name=""Infernity Conjurer"">Infernity Conjurer</a> and <a data-name=""Infernity Suppression"">Infernity Suppression</a> are very solid cards. Why don't we run them? We don't run them because we don't run enough Infernity cards. That's right. We don't have enough Infernoty cards in an Infernity deck. We don't have enough play starters for either, something the new support did not give us. By the time <strong>Suppression</strong> is live, you are already performing the combo, where it's anti-hand trap prowess would be too late. Hopefully, Konami gives the archetype more support in the near future so that we can use some of these cards to the fullest.  <span>Closing Remarks</span>  Well done for reading this far (considering that you are a Yu-Gi-Oh player, and most of the player base is semi-illiterate). If you have any suggestions, tell me in the comments section. The side deck is currently just a bunch of ideas I want to test out. So I'll close off with this: <ul>  	<li>I will be updating my horrible Eldlich-Nordic into something that has actual synergy, Tri-Brigade Nordic. That should be done in the near future.</li>  	<li>I will also be updating my Plunder list to include combos involving <a data-name=""Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot"">Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot</a>, and a few changes to the list.</li>  	<li>Lastly, I will release a Witchcrafter list in the near future, so be on the look out for that.</li> </ul>"

The basic concept is that Blazeman is a normal summon that allows you to grab a fusion spell, similar to how Alesiter can help bolster the consistency of Shaddoll in the Invoked variant. Blazeman can also turn into either a Light or Water attribute in this deck, making him a genuine swiss army knife for the Shaddoll archetype. There has been some thought to adding Shadowmist as well to give access to the Dark attribute, but it felt like too much of a brick.  Liquidman and Honest Neos let you turn your Emergency Call into different attributes, as well as having useful effects of their own. The synergy between Liquidman and the Shaddolls is quite good. Neos is mostly just a tutor target, but he can be useful at cracking over your opponents Windas or whatnot with Blazeman or Liquidman.  Everything else is pretty standard Shaddoll. We have the full Shaddoll combo package as well as some tech like Gameceil (who also doubles as an outlet for Absolute Zero). The extra deck could probably be better optimized, this is just what I've landed on for now.  Any feedback is appreciated!"

I added the timelords because I really think they are OP, <a data-name=""Michion"">Michion</a> for instance, can halve your opponent's life points, raphion works really well if your opponents holds a monster that has high attack power, you can target that monster and inflict life points equal to that monster's attack. Time maiden is used to give you timelords. I added big shield gardna ONLY so the opponent will attack gardna, and the card he would most likely attack gardna with is a card less than gardna's defence. Also, time lords can not be destroyed by battle or be inflicted on, but by the end of your phase and the opponents phase, the timelord gets shuffled back to the Deck. The whole of the Deck is to get enough Ra disciples and the different Ra phases to summon Ra. Trap cards are the core to stalling your opponent, but can be most likely countered which is one of the main reasons why we have the Time lords here. I added alexandrite dragon as another choice for summoning, if you want to get rid of low level monsters with effects which can eventually build up to higher monsters. You can also see Ash blossom &amp; Joyous spring x3, and effect veiler x2, which are used to get rid of your opponents effects. Finally we have draw cards such as Pot of duality, and Upstart goblin."

This time, Invoked Volcanics, even though they have no synergy and this deck makes no fucking sense. Youâre welcome, fuckers.</span><span> </span><span>This guide took me, like, two days, and iâm exhausted and i want to die. Also, credit to my boy RATA for his vid that helped me with this.</span><span> </span><span> Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â <span> Â  Â  Â  Â  </span></span><span>Deck guide</span>  <span>3x Rocket- Rocket is a key card of the deck, as it searches the Accelerator spell/trap line up for your plays, as the Accelators are essential. Although, it does take up the summon which you would normally like to use for Aleister, so. </span><span> </span><span>3x Scattershot- Scattershot gives a miniscule amount of burn damage to the opponent, although thatâs not the most important part of Scattershot. Scattershot, when itâs sent to the grave, sends 2 more copies of Scattershot to the grave, which inflict burn 500 more burn damage. This stacks up to 1500, which is pretty meaty, and sets up the grave for more plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Shell- Shell is another important card for the deck, as you want to shit it out to the grave to infict a tiny amount of burn from the guns. Afterwards, youâll want to use Shellâs effect to get more Shells, providing a ton of more fodder to shoot off with the guns. </span><span> </span><span>2x Counter- Counter is a pretty nice card as a surprise against the opponent, as you can dump it and the opponentâll probably not read it and forget about it. When they swing in on you, you can use Counter to inflict a fuck ton of burn damage considering how high the modern stats are. Although, Counter is mandatory, so it can be creeped out with the smallest monster on the opponentâs board, so remember that.</span><span> </span><span>2x Agnizinmaud- However you spell it, the True King thingy is really good at getting a body on board and monsters in the grave. It can get itself onto the board without taking up the normal summon, which is great for this deck as it can struggle to get large bodies on board. Additionally, he props the effects of your Volcanics, since he destroys them (which sends them to the grave) for cost. Additionally, on summon, he gets non-targeting banishing, which is amazing.</span><span> </span><span>3x Royal Firestorm Guards- Royal Firestorm Guards mainly serve to recycle your resources and is your main source of draw power. You constantly shit out monsters non-stop into the grave, so Firestorm recycles them for later plays, and gives you aÂ  great draw 2 to extend your plays. Firestorm does take up your normal summon though, so you do have to be careful with it and Aleister.</span><span> </span><span>3x Aleister- Aleister is a key part of the Invoked engine, as itâs the main material of all of the Invoked fusions. Additionally, you mainly want to normal summon it if you donât have an Invocation in hand already, so you can search invocation. Although, if you did draw into Invocation, you donât need to normal summon Aleister, leaving your normal summon free for Rocket and Firestorm. Aleister can be bricky sometimes, but is worth it because of the strength of the Invoked engine.</span><span> </span><span>3x Gamma- Gamma is the deckâs main handtrap, as itâs an omni-negate for monsters. Gamma is really important in the current meta as it can negate VFD and the such, which is insanely important in the current meta for, yâknow, not dying. Gamma also gets a body on board. The main problem of Gamma is that it requires a brick just to use it,Â  which is a pain in the ass. </span><span> </span><span>1x Driver- Driver is, basically a shitty garnet thats just for Gamma. You want to keep it in the deck, as itâs a pain in the ass to draw into. </span><span> </span><span>2x Blaze Accelerator- Blaze Accelerator isnât very good due to how restrictive it is, meaning youâll want to just use it and then send it to the grave in order to activateÂ  Tri-Blaze. Blaze Accelerator can still be used in emergency situations, though.</span><span> </span><span>2x Tri-Blaze- Tri-Blaze is mainly used to send Blaze, and then activate it. Tri-Blaze is great for filling up your grave with Pyroâs (with way less restrictions than Blaze), and it gives non-targeting destruction. It also gives a small amount of burn damage, but coupled with Scattershot it comes to 2000, which is a big number for burn. </span><span> </span><span>3x Invocation- Invocation is an amazing card for the Invocation engine, as you can use monsters from your hand, graveyard, or the opponentâs grave. This is great, as you can fill up the grave with more Volcanics if youâre making a Purgatrio, or you can make literally anything else using the opponentâs bullshit.</span><span> </span><span>2x Meltdown- Meltdown searches Aleister whenever you need it, although iâve found in playtesting that you rarely need Meltdown due to the three of Aleister, so I cut Meltdown down to 2. Meltdown also gives your fusion summons protection, but thats not as notable. </span><span> </span><span>3x Foolish Burial Goods- Foolish Burial Goods is mainly used to send Reload to the grave, for itâs great grave effect.</span><span> </span><span>1x Foolish Burial- Foolish Burial is mainly used for sending shit like Scattershot to the grave in order to activate their effects, and it sends them for no cost, and without the iffy requirements of stuff like the Blaze Accelerators. </span><span> </span><span>1x Instant Fusion- Instant Fusion is mainly used for getting out Raidjin, so you can flip down the opponentâs main source of negates to either A) Bait out their negate, or B) completely rid the negates.</span><span> </span><span>3x Reload- Reloadâs on field effect effect is fairly solid, as it allows you to ditch a Volcanic (triggering their GY effect and filling up the GY), and draw 1, which is amazing for generating tons of advantage. Due to this being a trap, though, this is insanely slow and annoying to use. Itâs grave effect is what is special about Reload, though. Youâre able to banish Reload from the grave to send a Volcanic from d e c k, which is amazing, as you donât need to use your hand. This is great, as it fills up your grave and triggers things like Scattershot without having to use resources from your precious hand.</span>  <span>The extra deck</span>  <span>2x Caliga- Caliga is a great floodgate to end the turn off of on, as you can pass with it and make sure the opponent canât rebuild their board. Due to how common the Dark attribute is on a ton of decks, itâs fairly easy to make it with the opponentâs cards.</span><span> </span><span>1x Raidjin- Raidjin is mainly summoned off of Instant Fusion, and itâs used to bait out negates, since you can summon it and attempt to flip down the opponentâs negation boss monster. Theyâll be forced to either have it flip down, or use their negate on Raidjin, which can save your plays.</span><span> </span><span>3x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the deckâs main Invoked monster, as since you mainly useÂ  Fire monsters, you can get out Purg consistenstenly. Purgatrio is basically a big, strong beater, and a fun card in general to use.</span><span> </span><span>1x Cocytus- Cocytus is mainly used for just, being a big wall that can lightly poke at the opponent sometimes. Cocytus is rarely summoned, only in certain match ups or situations. </span><span> </span><span>2x Augo- Augo is mainly a large body mid- to late game, as you can get some removal with it and then it grows to be a big beater, which is great for closing off games.</span><span> </span><span>3x Mechaba- Mechaba is another amazing monster in the deck, as itâs the deckâs main source of negations. Mechaba also sends cards from your hand directly to the grave, which triggers the effects of the Volcanics, making Mechaba stack up value. </span><span> </span><span>3x Elysium- Elysium is mainly just a big boss monster for late game, as itâs a large 32k beater that can provide non-targeting banishing removal, which is amazing in the current meta.</span><span> </span><span>The side deck</span>  <span>3x Volcanic Queen- Volcanic Queen is a great card, as itâs basically a kaiju with extra effects. While itâs on the opponentâs field, it forces them to tribute monsters or take 1000 damage, which is great for the Volcanic playstyle. Itâs mainly just in the side due to certain match ups and such.</span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- Ash, you know what Ash does. Itâs in the side deck because there was no space in the main. </span><span> </span><span>3x D.D Crow- See above.</span><span> </span><span>3x Lightning Storm- Lightning Storm is a great card for clearing fields when going 2nd.</span><span> </span><span>3x Imperm- Imperm is mainly used for negating scary monsters when going 2nd.</span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span><span> </span><span>So, this is mainly a going second burn deck. Youâll want to opt to go second, as this deck dies going first. Immediately activate your Blaze Accelerators, so you can send your Volcanics to clear the opponentâs field and inflict a ton of burn damage (if youâre using Scattershot.) Youâll also want to use your normal summon after that, either normal summoning Rocket to fill the gaps in your hand, or Aleister to nab you a Invocation. Then, youâll want to turbo into either Purgatrio orÂ  Mechaba, and hopefully use Reload for more effects.
