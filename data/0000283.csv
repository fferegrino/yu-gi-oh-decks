The main combo you want to go for is 2 Toads + UDF, which you can get with any 4 bodies. Abyss Shark and Nettle lock you from doing it, but Abyss Shark increases the consistency of the deck by a lot and Nettle gives you a lot more grind, so you can't really go without them. You usually have a minimum of Toad + Kragen, which is a pretty decent board and it gives you an immense amount of followup.  I'm not playing C101/C104 or CNaphil because I think the package takes too much valuable ED space for the mediocre payoff . For this same reason, I'm also not playing Lantern Shark, as its main purpose imo is being summoned from the deck with Buzzsaw to make a rank 5.  &nbsp;  Some advice:  If you can only make 1 Xyz and you're playing blind, go for Kragen, unless you have Buzzsaw in the GY, in which case, go for Toad for the followup.  Kragen's floating is extremely strong and can help you a lot going second. Don't be afraid to purposely crash it into your opponent's monsters to get 2 quick non-targetting pops per turn or a free UDF. It can also attach Toad from the GY to get lots of advantage."

Powerhold the moving battery is kind of a boss monster in the deck being able to be a 3400 from a trap. Your spells and traps are meant to hold your opponents down while you are always +1 off your gadgets. The main boss monsters are Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer who you can get by hard drawing fusion destiny or by playing 2 of your level 4 monsters because they are all effect monsters to play Predaplant Verte Anaconda and using its ability to activate fusion destiny straight from you deck, and Apollousa who you mainly want to use if you get out Phoenix enforcer and have extra monsters with different names to throw into her link summon, you could also play her if your get out a lot of creatures with a lucky hand to make her very big. If you are going first they how great at controlling your opponents board state. If going second you probably still want Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer if possible but you boss monsters are Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe who you can get by using the rank 4 xyz Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid, or Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder who you can get by using your Zoodiac monster and making sure to end on Zoodiac Boarbow so you can attack directly then in main 2 summon Zeus out with 6 materials. All of your xyz can gain crazy amounts of power through Xyz Territory helping your big monster become even bigger and helpful for getting Number 27 to activate its ability. Double summon and Platinum Gadget can allow you to possibly even get out 5 or more level 4 monsters on your first turn to make whatever summons you need to win."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

An actually good deck!?,"So right off the bat... Wow. I genuinely didn't thought that both archetypes would mash so well together. Now, while it may have an arguably better endboard than what i personally believe is the best variant of Libromancers (Libromancer Dogmatika) it is not <strong>as</strong> consistent, but don't let that discourage you of trying it out, it still is quite consistent.  <em><strong>What do Nephthys do to aid Libromancer?</strong></em>  First of all, libromancers love having more ritual monsters to activate their effects. Nephthys has access to ""<strong>Pre Preparation of rites</strong>"" which nets you a nice +1 and searches a ritual monster. ""<strong>preparation of rites</strong>"" searches basically everything from both archetypes.  With only one Geek Boy/Fire/First Appearance/E-Teleport you can do the entire Libromancer combo. Diviner is naturally the Normal Summon of the deck, and you can search her out with Benten who is searched out by Preparation of Rites  <strong><em>Ok, but WHAT does Nephthys do?</em></strong>  If you summon ""<strong>Conductor of Nephthys</strong>"" you can make a 4 material apollousa or any generic Link-4 of your preference, while having a destroyed ""Phoenix of Nephthys"" in the GY ready to SS in your next Stand-by Phase and pop the entire backrow (or waste one opponent's negation) all by herself.  ...  Pretty dope, right?. And you can actually do it without losing advantage since conductor is a lv 2 monster, so you can tribute the leftover geekboy of the normal Libromancer combo to start it all.  The endboard should consist of: ""<strong>Baroness of the Fleur</strong>"" + ""<strong>Libromancer Doombroker</strong>""(with intervention set) + 3200 ATK ""<strong>Apollousa, bow of the goddess</strong>"" + ""<strong>Phoenix of Nephthys</strong>"" destroyed in the GY.  Notes:  -I tried to introduce a really small Dogmatika package (2x Nadir Servant, 1x Ecclesia, 1x Fleur) but since this build relays more on the extra deck Nadir is not that great of an extender unless used last. The only target to search by sending arc light would be White Knight/Relic which would require adding Dogmatikalamity, it is a good ritual spell, but at the same time really hurts the consistency. Also i hate opening with fleur.  -At first i played 1 copy of ""Libromancer Fireburst"" thinking it would give the deck OTK potential, but seeing how easily you can summon Accesscode/Borrelsword, it is just redundant.  -No, the Phoenix of Nephthys reviving and popping backrow doesn't hurt your plays since it SS during <strong>your</strong> next Stand-by phase, and by that time, if you still have backrow it's because your opponent didn't play a thing lol. Also the field spell doesn't matter neither since you'd search another with geekboy anyway  (I'm still testing it, so the decklist may be tuned in the near future)  <strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Main deck  Out: 1x Cerulean Phoenix Of Nephthys.  In: 1x Sauravis, 3x Ash Blossom and joyous spring.  Extra Deck:  Out: 1x Draco Berserker, 1x Stardust Warrior, 1x Herald of the arc light, 1x Nephthys the sacred flame.  In: 1x Avramax, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Borreload Savage Dragon  Reasoning: The ED is easy to explain, basically more going second options. Also, since this deck combo plays a link-2 you have easier access to borreload, which is arguably better than berserker. Cerulean Nephthys comes up... Never, i only played it to have another target for pre-prep in case i draw 2 copies, but that also doesn't show up, and to slim the chances even more i decided to increase the size to 45 cards to filter out the bricks better, i believe the deck has enough search power to endure this."

The appeal to the deck is easy to see - lots of 1 card starters that play nice with each other, lots of space for hand traps and interruptions. Very possibly the best Mechaba shell (until Branded Fusion gets here).  So, it's pretty simple - all of the Aleister cards, all of the Dogmatika cards (with a 2nd copy of Punishment), the DPE package, a pair of pots, 2 upstart, standard Ash/Maxx/Called by for Maxx ""C"" formats, standard Imperm as the first hand trap after that, and Forbidden Droplet, because the tech plays this card can make are pretty good in this deck (even though it isn't a GY deck it takes advantage of removing cards from your spell/trap zones). We also have 1 Shaddoll Schism, with 1 of each of the best Shaddoll fusions (really you're hoping to make Winda by sending Apkallone off of Nadir Servant). We also have a single VFD in the extra deck, to make using the pair of Mechabas in a grind game.  I forgot Upstart conflicts with the Pots. Fixed it now."

New T1 play goes into 4 mat Apo and Nat Beast, typically with Berserkion in hand for a T3 summon. Prefers going first but doesn't have much trouble going second, even against the current meta. Unga bunga throw shiny rock and magic sticky rock. Losing Needlefiber hasn't really hurt its viability as it was only really there for a water in the grave.

As the deck has no 1 card combo, unrelated cards (handtraps, for example) have to be cut for consistency. However, almost every board can be clearer somehow. if you draw the right cards.  One thing worth noting though, as the deck combos are all 2-3 cards combos, together with Card of Demise's discard effect, you will not have any luxury to run any handtraps, so don't bother trying. If your opponent runs any FTK deck it's gg.  Tips for playing the deck: <ul>  	<li>If you want to activate The Monarchs Stormforth in opp's turn, chain it AFTER True Draco's traps, or else the effect of being able to tribute opp's monster will not apply to the traps' tribute summon.</li>  	<li>Remember to chain True Draco's searches to opp's effect, then chain The Monarchs Erupt as chain 3. This way you can search for your cards while negate opp's monster effects at the same time.</li>  	<li>Amano Iwato will stop every monster activation effect. Always summon it first.</li>  	<li>Try to tribute summon your True Draco BEFORE activating any Pot cards or Card of Demise or Dragonic Diagram. This way even if your spell is Ashed you can still at least search for a True Draco card.</li>  	<li>When you do not have a good hand and have Dragonic Diagram activated,  do not hesitate to destroy a True Draco's monster on the field for True Draco Heritage. With your 2,3 cards draw you can get Disciples of the True Dracophoenix to extend your draws and your combo further.</li> </ul>"

Summoning Borreload Savage Dragon can easily be done in nearly every duel YET Borreload Savage Dragon is the main closer and often gets the most value later in the game after several link monsters have been destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck build runs heavily artillery trap cards that can devastate an opponent otherwise dealt with such as different variants of Mirror Force and Magic Cylinder (Mirror Force Launcher, Mirror Force, Magical Cylinders, and Magic Cylinder) and main decks Anti-Spell Fragrance as a stall mechanism to how this whole Rokket/Borrel/Dragon Link Deck build works. Any spells or traps that can prevent an opponent from flooding the field or attempting to win in one turn would tremendously help this deck build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Boot Sector Launches are VERY due to how Striker Dragon is currently at 1. Boot Sector Launch will often be destroyed, running 3 is an insurance to having another one available. This build heavily relies on Boot Sector Launch to summon Rokket monsters onto the field and begin Link climbing. Boot Sector Launch at 3 is very necessary. (There are no field spell extenders included aside from Striker Dragon the reason being is that field spell extenders can become bricks once Boot Sector Launch has been activated. There are very technical plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer that can help compensate and bring resources out onto the field while Boot Sector Launch is not active).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Quick Launch are because they are not limited to once per turn and extends 3 more copies of any other Rokket in deck. One of the most versatile cards in the deck next to Rokket Tracer and Boot Sector Launch. Quick Launch synergies with most of the Rokket monster End of Phase destruction effect and there are plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer and Quick Launch. (Very important to help bring out Rokket Tracer.)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Rokket Tracers - Without a doubt one of the most technical cards in the Rokket archetype. (Rokket Tracer and Quick Launch are the best Rokket extenders in the deck to help summon out Rokket monsters from deck). There are clever plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer due to its quick effect. For example, Rokket Tracer can be used to quick effect onto any quick-play spell being used (Some clever plays involve having Rokket Tracer on the field, activating Quick Launch as chain-link1 following it up with using Rokket Tracer's quick-effect to target Quick Launch as chain-link2, targeting Quick Launch to destroy it as chain-link2, granting a Rokket Tracer speical summon off chain-link2 and a Quick Launch special summon off chain-link1). This same exact combo can be done with Rapid Trigger, Squib Draw, Bayonet Punisher, and any other Quick-Play spell as long as Rokket Tracer's chain-link is of latter of the quick-spells activation. Please keep in mind that these combos can be done on your opponent's turn as well. The real advantage to this is that these combos can be used as the final parts of a chain due to how they are all quick-play/quick-effects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rokket Tracer can also be used to destroy a Rokket monster equipped with Borrel Regenerator to trigger Rokket Tracer's special summon effect, draw 1 from Borrel Regenerator and depending on the ROkket destroyed grant another Rokket special summon during the end phase. (This clever play destroys your Rokket and sends it to the graveyard. The Rokket Monster does not get banished. Borrel Regenerator is worded cleverly and only banishes the Rokket monster attached to it if Borrel Regenerator is destroyed or removed from the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Rokket Caliber - Helps provide variance to build Borreload Savage Dragon. Very useful when having Double Disrupter Dragon in hand and it is also very useful card to be able to be special summoned to any zone a Dark Link monster points to for resources to Link climb.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 of each other Rokket Monster - Provides variance for combos with Link monsters that can target (Mainly for Borrel Dragons and Booster Dragon. Striker Dragon as well can trigger a Rokket's quick-play destruction effect). All Rokket variance Gives Boot Sector Launch even more value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Borreload Riot Dragon - Possibly the heaviest brick in the deck but was included to provide more value out of Double Disruptor Dragon. Can be very strong if summoned early on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Absorouter Dragon, Noctovision Dragon and Outburst Dragon - All 3 of these have different extending functions YET their main purpose is to go +1 when link summoning. Both Absorouter Dragon and Noctovision Dragon are the main Rokket Synchron targets to build a quick Borreload Savage Dragon. Outburst Dragon helps further extend Rokket monster effects by destroying them when being special summoned. (This sets up resources in GY for Boot Sector Launch to have more value later in the game)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Triggering Wurm - Was put in mainly for Topologic Zeroboros. Has follow-up synergy with most of the deck when used as link material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Speedburst Dragon - A fun and useful extender that helps search 2 Rokkets when tribute summoned. Its in hand effect can also be triggered when Exploderokket's quick-play effect is triggered on field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gateway Dragon - One of the best first turn extenders to summon out a level 4 or lower Rokket monster from hand before Boot Sector Launch has been activated on the field. (Helps provide a Rokket to link summon into Striker Dragon to then search Boot Sector Launch to add to hand. Striker Dragon can then destroy itself and add the Rokket monster in graveyard back to the hand. Boot Sector Launch can then be activated to special summon the Rokekt monster that was added back to the hand to then link off into a Link-2 Dragon link monster).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hibernation Dragon - a very useful mid-game card that can help bring back a level 4 or lower Rokket monster from graveyard to hand to then special summon with Boot Sector Launch. When Hibernation Dragon is in the graveyard it serves as a Link Monster Reborn for your own link monsters by being able to be banished to special summon 1 Dark Dragon Link monster from your graveyard. (All link monsters in main deck are Dark Dragon link monsters).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Borrel Regenerator - Helps set up mini combos for Rokket Tracer or Squib Draw to trigger special summon effects and draw engine. Very useful and can also help set up resources for a link summon OR to summon Booreload Savage Dragon if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Squib Draw - Very underestimated draw engine. Synergies with most of the End Phase Rokket effects and helps provide a draw 3 with Borrel Regenerator. Very underestimated and versatile. Since it is a quick-play spell it can be used during your opponent's turn to bait spell/trap removal and easily go +1. Can also be used with a Rokket attached to Borrel Regenerator to draw 3 cards and trigger an End Phase Rokket effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bayonet Punisher -&nbsp; Very underestimated. More than often 1 Borrel link monster will either be on your field or GY (being able to banish 3 cards from your opponents graveyard). Any of the other effects on this card is a plus and can easily be met if this card is activated later on in the duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rapid Trigger - Fun card to bring out Borreload Furious Dragon early in the game. Destroys materials on field to fusion summon Borreload Furious Dragon and also protects Borreload Furious Dragon from any other special summoned monster effects from the extra deck (Rapid Trigger triggers Rokkets End Phase effects). Borreload Furious Dragon helps stun and provide synergy with Rokket monsters End Phase effects. Very underestimated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Borrel Supplier - Gets its most value when being able to summon a lower Link Borrel monster to help get Borrel Supplier's Standby special summoning effects. Get its most power when used with a Borrel Link-4 (Ideally with Borreload Dragon and Borrelguard Dragon).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Force Launcher and Mirror Force - Synergies with Rokket/Borrel/Dragon Link Deck functions. Forces opponent to use spell/trap removal and provides Boot Sector Launch GY resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Magical Cylinders and Magic Cylinder - Provides similar function to deck as how Mirror Force Launcher and Mirror Force do. Though Magical Cylinders effect is slightly different from Mirror Force Launcher's in that it is not a continuous trap, Magical Cylinder helps set up a trap counter to an opponent's monster's attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anti-Spell Fragrance - Very powerful, helps delay opponent's spell cards and leaves any normal spell card vulnerable to destruction. Forcers opponent to deal with it otherwise leaves their spells vulnerable on the field. Helps delay opponent from going off on combos. If necessary or if an extra copy is in hand Anti-Spell Fragrance can also be destroyed by Rokket Tracer for a +1. Synergies with the whole Rokket deck build due to the most versatile Rokket Spell cards being Quick-Play.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side Deck:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Red Reboot - Insurance card to seal the duel. Never set, always keep in hand and only use to end the duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Royal Decree - Tech card vs Eldlich</p>"

It's better to pull Winda out on your opponent's turn if possible. We run a lot of interruption and interaction, as the biggest body we're ever getting on board is 3000 power, which is far too easy to swing over. Try to keep Monster negates and big bodies off the field.  &nbsp;  Going first, you'll want to lay down your protective traps, and try to use as few cards in hand as possible to get into Tearalaments Kitkalos. If Reino is in your hand, grab a Shaddoll if you don't already have one, otherwise grab whatever. If Reino is not in your hand, grab Reino, put him in your hand. Never summon Kaleido-Heart on your turn unless you need to pop something or you need lethal.  &nbsp;  I'm not very good at Yu Gi Oh so I have no other advice, this deck could use Barrel Rock, but sadly that's only in the OCG. You can sub in any Stone Ogre Grotto, but it's not the same."

I thought they were the end of Yugioh and blah blah blah. But I've been playing with them for a while now, and a good chunk of my favorite archetypes are heavily focused on links: Tenyis, Krawlers, Live Twins, Mekk-Knights, and of course World Chalice. For those who aren't aware, World Chalice is an archetype that focuses on spamming normal monsters to use for link summoning a ton of monsters. It also used to include a busted synchro card, but that's been banned forever and probably will keep being banned forever, so pour one out for the real play maker of the deck. Gone but not forgotten. Anyways, your end boards in this deck could range from super cool link bosses like a Borrel or an Arrival Cyberse or even a Topologic. All of these are solid options, Arrival Cyberse just requires a ton of investment to be Kaiju bait, and I personally just hate the Borrels and Topologics. So, we'll be playing the deck as Takahashi intended and making Avramax or Apo instead. Keep in mind that any of those other options can absolutely work as well, it's just all personal preference.  First, let's go through a quick card by card of the deck and side deck.  <strong><span>MAIN DECK</span></strong>: <p><strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x -<a data-name=""Beckoned by the World Chalice"">Beckoned by the World Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Chosen by the World Chalice"">Chosen by the World Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Crowned by the World Chalice"">Crowned by the World Chalice</a>: Yes, they are all normal monsters. Yes, you will brick sometimes. But you need three of each since starting your combo basically requires a normal monster to be summoned. Some people run two of each, but unless you run a supplementary engine that spams normal monsters (like the Agent of Creation - Venus), you need as many of these cards as you can run.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Chalice&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Chalice""</a>: This card seems like a bit of a bizarre include at first glance, but it acts as an amazing combo extender in the deck. Since Imduk gives you an extra normal summon, you can tribute summon this card very easily during your combo and it brings out resources from deck if sent to the GY after being tribute summoned. It does add to the brick potential, so you can run one or two instead, but having more World Chalice monsters in your hand extends your plays so I try to max out on them.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a>: The archetypal Stratos that helps keep your hand full of World Chalices to extend plays. Its grave effect also allows you to send a card with a good effect in the grave (*cough* *cough* the next card) or proccing all your World Chalice link monster's effects in a pinch. Run three to ensure you see it most games, but just be warned it can't be used as link material for your combo starter.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon"">World Chalice Guardragon</a>: While the in-hand (or on-field) effect lets it work as a solid handtrap, its grave effect is what makes it so important in the deck. It lets you summon a normal monster from grave to a zone a link monster points to, which helps extend your plays that extra bit farther to end on a more formidable board than you otherwise could. Run three but try not to normal summon it unless you have no other choices since it does even less than Lee does when normal summoned.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>: On paper, Rescue Rabbit sounds awesome. It fetches two materials straight from deck by only taking your normal summon and it dodges Called by the Grave by banishing itself. It also happens to be the biggest handtrap bait in the deck, so you'll rarely see it pop off. Still, run three since in those one in a million games where it does work, it makes the best end boards the deck can produce.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong><span>Spells</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>: Summons a normal monster straight from deck. You run nine of them, so unlike some combo decks that run just one normal monster as a target, this will always have live targets turn one. Run three because it's the best way to start your turn.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a>: As it turns out, Chosen is a psychic-type, so you get to run E-Tele in the deck. This also opens the possibility of including Gamma and/or Ghost Ogre as a both handtraps and potential combo extenders if needed.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: Summons the dragon straight from deck while potentially setting up the grave for its effect to work. Run one because you can't run more, but if One for One ever moves off the limited list (it won't unless it's getting banned instead) run more copies. Just be warned that unlike Dai and E-Tele this has a pretty good chance to brick and is an awful card to top deck if you make it to the late game.</li>  	<li>3x -<a data-name=""World Legacy's Heart"">World Legacy's Heart</a>: This lets you refill your hand with World Chalices and offers some ok protection to your link monsters when in grave. Run three all the time.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>: A Monster Reborn if you have a free link zone open. Run two because it's searchable and a hard once-per-turn and run the actual Monster Reborn as well if you find the space for it.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Legacy Discovery"">World Legacy Discovery</a>: The archetypal field spell that isn't as important as most other archetypal field spells. Gives a teeny stat boost that comes up every once in a million duels and a nice recovery effect. You can run anywhere from zero to three, so if you're looking for some space to fit more handtraps or other tech cards, this is the card to trim down on to fit them in.</li>  	<li>1x -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Solid handtrap defense that the deck desperately needs. Crossout might be a better choice since you can run more copies, but it requires way too much main deck space to function properly, so I never use it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong><span>Traps</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: My favorite handtrap, but it could be replaced by any other handtrap instead. Ash is always a good pick and Ghost Belle is useful against a solid number of decks. Same with Ghost Ogre and Gamma but Gamma needs an extra card's worth of space to work.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong><span>EXTRA DECK</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Imduk the World Chalice Dragon"">Imduk the World Chalice Dragon</a>: You’re gonna see this card a whole lot if you play the deck. Every turn that doesn’t end immediately will summon this boi at least once, and there’s a good reason why. An extra normal summon in a deck that uses a monster who needs to be tribute summoned is just incredible. Through a normal turn you end up going through one or two, so you can shave one copy off. But personally, three always works the best for me with how many normal monsters the deck needs to link away.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Ib the World Chalice Priestess"">Ib the World Chalice Priestess</a>: This card acts like a mini towers but you’ll rarely see it used for that effect. It mostly just serves as additional extension with its grave effect as well as giving good arrows to complement Auram’s. Run two since you’ll never need the third, but you might sometimes need the second.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Auram the World Chalice Blademaster"">Auram the World Chalice Blademaster</a>: Can occasionally serve as a solid beatstick in a pinch, but you really need its tribute effect and grave effect to help extend plays. Run two for the same reason you run two Ib.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior</a>: The original “boss monster” of the archetype. Can draw up to three cards when summoned and allows you to non-targeting send a card to the grave by sending one of your own. A good card, but you’ll only ever summon him once.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a>: The best World Legacy support card ever released other than Girsu. Two completely generic materials can set any World Legacy spell/trap from deck and the pool of good World Legacy cards is just insane. You can grab Succession as a reborn spell, Heart as extra World Chalices in hand, Clash for some attack manipulation, Awakens if you want to run a link that you’d want to summon on your opponent’s turn, Struggle as easily accessible spell/trap removal, Cliffhanger as a really funny way to shift a game in your favor, and Sorrow as a good counter trap. Run one or two depending on how many targets you put in deck.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>: A solid boss monster to end on, especially if you summon it using I:P. Has great protection and redirects any attacks to itself while dodging targeted effects. Plus, its amazing battle phase effect helping close out games. Run one because you will only ever need one</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke"">World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke</a>: This is mostly just here because I wanted every World Chalice in the deck, but it can also help with OTKs. Especially against link-focused decks. It’s also a good Super Poly target against those decks as well, but that does sort of kill its OTK potential if you Super Poly into this card. Run one because you probably won’t even use one most of the time.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: The best way to get World Chalice Guardragon in grave in a pinch. You’ll only ever need the one tho since it’s only used to get Guardragon in grave.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Summoning Spider gives you the easiest access to additional tribute fodder for Chalice, but you’ll only ever need the one since past turn one, you’re trying to kill your opponent as quickly as you can.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: Just a solid card to summon Avramax with. You won’t always have the extra material for it, but when you do you can make a very tough to out Avramax. You could also use it to summon Apo or a different boss monster to provide that same protection tho.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: The best generic way to get negates for a deck, which this deck desperately needs to not die instantly. Only run one since you’ll only ever use one per game.</li> </ul> <strong><span>SIDE DECK</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Avida, Rebuilder of Worlds"">Avida, Rebuilder of Worlds</a>: This seems like a strange card to include in the side deck, but it does come up sometimes. Since this deck spams link monsters like almost no other, you can easily have the grave filled with different named links after turn 1, and if your board is broken on the next turn, you can sometimes fulfill the summoning condition on your own and just reset the gamestate in your favor. If you’re going against another link deck, this becomes even easier to achieve. And besides, you’re running World Chalices. Avida is like the very end of the World Legacy lore so you’ve gotta play it in the deck that features the very beginning of it.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>: Any Kaiju works here, but Gameciel is just the best. Do not play Lava Golem or Sphere Mode unless you desperately need the extra tributes though. This deck almost always needs its normal summon to start its plays, so using that up on a Lava Golem doesn’t always work super well.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>: Just another two copies of Feather Duster. This could be Twin Twisters or something like Raigeki instead, but I just like having a ton of anti-backrow insurance.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Harpie’s Feather Duster"">Harpie’s Feather Duster</a>: The best anti-backrow card ever printed, but it isn’t always enough to break through backrow decks.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>: Helps with backrow removal that also completely ruins some Eldlich cards as well as the ever-spooky <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a>.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: You’re already running Almarduke so you might as well run a way to summon him without sending your whole field to grave. You can honestly skip this one though unless you make space for more targets for this card.</li> </ul> <strong><span>EXTRA OPTIONS</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>More handtraps: This deck can make some space to fit in about 6-9 handtraps if you wanna cut down on the field spell and maybe Chalice and Rescue Rabbit as well. Just don’t cram too many handtraps in the deck because you need to see your starter cards as consistently as you can.</li>  	<li>Other link bosses: Avramax is a good card and all, but just passing on an Avramax doesn’t really win the game on its own. Apo is good as well, but both leave you open to Kaijus completely stopping your gameplan. You can try and make a triple co-linked Tri-Gate work, but it requires some specific links to be on board for the co-link to work. It’s still a good card though and gives an additional negate to your end boards if you manage to successfully do the co-link. The previously mentioned Borrels and Topologic monsters are also good options, but it depends on how you want to deck to work. Just be careful if you run Topologics since this deck loves summoning stuff to link arrows, which the Topologics don’t enjoy all that much. Arrival Cyberse still works as an end boss, but it takes more resources than anything else mentioned. Underworld Goddess is a good option in the deck, but it does require going second to make full use of its effect, which this deck struggles with. Other than that, there are the Knightmares as well, but I didn’t wanna include them for lore reasons.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a>: Acts as a search card that for your normal monsters that also sets up the grave. It’s an ok include, but you generally want as many normal monsters in deck as you can so Dai, Chalice, and E-Tele have as many targets as possible.</li>  	<li>Guardragons: If you trim down some of the excess World Chalice cards, you can put a Guardragon engine in the deck as well. It’s not nearly as good as it was before Elpy and Agarpain were banned, but it still gives some nice extension to the deck if you find yourself in need of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Agent of Creation - Venus"">The Agent of Creation - Venus</a>: A good initial normal summon for the deck that can make way better endboards than the World Chalices can make natively. It just tends to brick me more than it helps me since all the Mystical Shine Balls clog your hand easily.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>: This deck summons an absolute ton of monsters to perform its combo, and it doesn’t really summon a negate until it reaches its endboard. Crossout is the only real Nibiru protection the deck can make use of, so it might be a good idea to include it either in addition to Called by or instead of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a>: This card is a ton of money for a reason. If you get handtrapped you can draw some more cards, Forceful Sentry your opponent, or just snag one of their monsters. All three of these effects work well in the deck so having three copies isn’t a bad idea.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a> / <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>: Since this is a link deck, snagging an opponent’s monster helps a ton with extending your plays. It also forces out negates since this deck doesn’t work well through interaction.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> / <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>: Both cards are useful in shutting down negate boards when going second and Droplet even helps with graveyard setup.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>: This is the only link 1 monster that can use Lee as material turn 1 (from what I could find anyway). So, it’s useful for getting her into the grave if you brick, but it doesn’t do much other than that. At least Linkuriboh does something when it’s on board. Almiraj just kinda sits there and prays your opponent bricks as well. Still, it does have a single corner case where it can be useful, so it’s a valid option to run.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>: Makes your turns play much differently than they otherwise would, but Girsu and Lib play super well with each other. If you run him just be mindful that you’ll have to adjust your plays around him. I also just really love running all the “final stages” of the original World Chalices in the same deck as the originals. (Auram becomes Avramax and then Avida, Ib becomes Lib and I guess Lee does too but that’s a complicated explanation, Imduk becomes Almarduke, and Ningirsu becomes Girsu)</li> </ul> I was originally planning on going through every potential combo the deck can produce, but there is just so much variation in the deck to realistically cover them all. So instead, I’ll just go over the basic steps of the combo. <ol>  	<li>Summon a normal monster (Dai, Rabbit, E-Tele, or Normal Summon)</li>  	<li>Link summon Link Spider (if you have another normal in hand), otherwise summon Imduk</li>  	<li>If you summoned Link Spider, summon a Normal from hand and link it into Imduk</li>  	<li>Tribute summon Chalice</li>  	<li>Link away Chalice and any remaining card to summon Auram</li>  	<li>Activate Chalice, then Imduk in that order to chain block</li>  	<li>Resolve the effects to gain three more material on board</li>  	<li>Make sure one monster is in a zone Auram points to and that that zone is not the center monster zone.</li>  	<li>Link the two materials Auram doesn’t point to into Ib</li>  	<li>Tribute the other material using Auram’s effect to summon Imduk from grave</li>  	<li>If Guardragon is in grave, activate its effect and summon to a zone Ib points to. Otherwise, use Lee’s effect to send Imduk to grave to summon another card from hand. And if that isn’t available either, just link everything into Apo or Avramax and pass turn.</li>  	<li>If you used Guardragon, summon Lib with the Imduk and the extra material on board to set World Legacy Succession from deck. If World Legacy Succession is already in hand, set World Legacy’s Heart instead. If you summoned Lee instead, summon Apo or Avramax here and then pass turn.</li>  	<li>Special summon Imduk to the zone Lib points to.</li>  	<li>Link away Imduk and Lib to summon Ningirsu</li>  	<li>Activate Ningirsu and Imduk in that order both to chain block and to maximize the draws</li>  	<li>Summon the monster for Imduk’s effect to the zone adjacent to Ningirsu, and then draw 3 cards. Those three cards help you play during the next turn as by now your hand is almost entirely empty.</li>  	<li>From here, you can either link away Ib and Auram into Avramax, link away Ib, Auram, and the extra monster for Apo, link away the extra monster (if it was a normal) to make Imduk and have the whole World Chalice crew there or summon Almarduke to flex on your opponent. It’s up to you really.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Hopefully that explains the basic combo the deck can do. There’s a ton of variance between hands so the combo won’t always work exactly as intended, but that’s what practice is for. Test a ton of hands and see how far you can take the deck. It may not be the next meta-contender, but it really is a fun deck to learn and play. And I hope I was able to present a good way to run the deck here. If you have any questions about the deck or any suggestions, please comment them so I can either help you out or improve on a deck that I absolutely adore."

This deck focuses on getting Halq out asap then grabbing deskbot 001 and going into Auroradon. This will begin your combo to go into true king.  Sac Auroradon and a token to go into O-lion, then O-lion and a token goes into Rose Maiden. Rose maiden and deskbot 001 go into coral dragon. Then coral dragon  and a token go into Crocodragon. Then using Rose maidens effect you can banish it to bring back Coral dragon, then Coral dragon and another token goes into  Shenshen, Overlay shenshen and crocodragon to get True King of all calamities. Summon it in defense, set your traps/distruption you may have and the game is very  close to being over. Last thing to do is turn your Priority switch to On so you can use its effect on their draw step to prevent getting kaiju'd before you can use  its effect.  &nbsp;  The amazing thing about this combo it's a 1 card combo meaning you do all of that without losing your entire hand, it opens up your next turn to OTK or really put yourself super ahead of the game."

Circular adds a new take on Mathmech, expanding it's combo into just a single card. Your usual endboard ends out with Superfactorial, Heatsoul, some set traps and hand traps. The Mathmech combo of this deck can be utilized into a lot of Cyberse decks. Here is how to perform it:  1: Circular effect, send Sigma to the graveyard, special summon circular  2: Sigma effect, special summon itself  3: Circular triggers off of Sigma's summon, adding Superfactorial  4: Xyz into Alembertain, Alembertain adds either Addition or Subtraction  5: Special summon the added monster  6: Link into Splash Mage, special summon any monster  7: Link into Heatsoul  Heatsoul draw one card  Set any traps you drew from the draw phase or Heatsoul and pass turn!  The beauty about Heatsoul is that you can draw during your opponent's turn, giving you either more hand traps for your opponent to face or giving you follow-up. Superfactorial can make Laplacian, which can send a card in hand to the graveyard, a monster they control to the graveyard, or a spell and trap card they control to the graveyard. It's a great way to troublesome cards from the field while also removing any possible extenders or follow-up in their hand. This deck can also OTK utilizing Update Jammer, which can make Accesscode be able to attack twice. Since you're only able to attack with one monster when using Circular, this is excellent. If you want to see more Mathmech, you can add in a second Nabla to get the Mathmech engine to pop out more. Cynet Mining can discard your Eldlich cards, making both your engines synchronize by discarding a card you want to hit the graveyard to add Circular. This deck doesn't fair very well against cards like Dimension Shifter. Mathmech Eldlich is a interesting deck using Mathmechs to draw into more pieces, hand traps, or anything else while also granting the removal of 3 cards and follow-up. When it comes to Mathmechs, the sky is the limit."

The plays in this deck get a tad intricate so I apologize if I lose some of the detail, playing it yourself and reading the cards should help where needed.  &nbsp;  The goal of this deck is to enable high attack monsters to be uninterrupted in destroying your opponents lifepoints. It does so through effect monsters such as Calamities and Zeus.  Commonly this deck has enough SS power to outdo the negates found commonly, and options for plays after most negates though less optimal.  If at all possible, your field will scale according to performance, allowing you to potentially get monsters such as Infinitrack Megaclops on the first or second turn.  If megaclops is on the field, ensure good control/power XYZ are in your graveyard. Frequently use this effect to eliminate potential threats while creating further ones for your opponent, and restricting their field of play through the summoned monsters effects.  Otherwise, create special summoning loops and use simple effects like Citadel and Fortress to destroy one backfield card and all of your opponents monsters under 3,000 attack.  &nbsp;  Furthermore just play intelligently, if Superdreadnought Dora is on the field along with Citadel, use Dora's effects on itself and then activate citadel with Dora as the target. All of your monsters survive, all of your opponents monsters under 3,200 atk are destroyed and doesnt target.  This deck summons allot of monsters and allows you to construct and reconstruct your field in order to best overcome obstacles laid infront of you. Sometimes you'll be out of options, but I've never had any problems getting to platinum running this deck."

Of course, you can still <strong>interact with the opponent by sending cards from their deck to the GY</strong> using <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a> to trigger the Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> effect and <strong>destroy a card on the field</strong> but it's not the main focus of the deck in terms of End Board. Turn 1 usually you want to access <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> to be your <strong>Normal Summon and bring another high Level Vampire</strong> like <a data-name=""Vampire Scarlet Scourge"">Vampire Scarlet Scourge</a> onto the field directly from the deck. I don't use more copies of <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> because it <strong>RESTRICTS you in the Battle Phase</strong> to only be able to attack with the monster brought by Special Summon by this effect so you are harmed throughout the game by not being able to take important monsters from your opponent in the Battle Phase. Speaking of this <strong>RESTRICTION of attacking in the Battle Phase</strong>, <a data-name=""Vampire Scarlet Scourge"">Vampire Scarlet Scourge</a> itself <strong>restricts you to not being able to attack with the monster brought by its effect</strong> during the Battle Phase so you have to understand well the best way to use these effects to not lose chances of take monsters from opponent in Battle Phase.  //////////////////////////////////////  The idea behind the <strong>Vendread Engine</strong> is that it gives you <strong>more Grind Game options and aggressive plays</strong> because for example if you do the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> + <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> Combo you add the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> and Ritual Summon it by <strong>sending another Slayer from the deck to the GY</strong> and then use the two monsters to LINK-2 <a data-name=""Puzzlomino,"">Puzzlomino,</a> and the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> will trigger eff to add another <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a><strong> of Follow Up for the next turn</strong> at the same time it sends the <a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a> to the GY that will <strong>come back for Special Summon in</strong> <a data-name=""Puzzlomino"">Puzzlomino</a>'s <strong>zone and that way you manipulate its Level to XYZ Summon</strong> it together with a Vampire Monster you have on the field <strong>or to interact with the opponent</strong> by match the level with the opponent's monster you want to <strong>destroy with the second Puzzlomino effect</strong>. Another way to interact is to make the <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> in place of the Puzzlomino and in the same way as before you bring the <a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a> <strong>in the zone it points and exchange its control</strong> with the opponent stealing a Boss Monster he has on the field giving in exchange a 500ATK monster.  This engine then is <strong>interaction, enabler to XYZ Summon as mentioned before and Follow Up</strong> because you will Ritual Summon the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> again on your next turn and then team up with a Level 6 Vampire monster to make one of your <strong>RANK-6 available</strong>.  <strong>Details of this engine</strong>: After Summoning the <strong>first</strong> <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> you always <strong>use it as LINK material and not as XYZ material</strong> because if you don't you can't trigger eff when it's sent to the GY because it's no longer considered Ritual Summoned Card. The second detail of this engine is that the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> will be <strong>destroyed in the End Phase of the opponent's turn</strong> and that's why it's better to use it as a LINK or XYZ material on your own turn to avoid losing card advantage. The third detail is that sending the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> from your <strong>hand to the GY is free as you can Ritual Summon it in the GY</strong> so it's easy to <strong>pay the cost of cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Jack-o-Bolan"">Jack-o-Bolan</a> and <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////  Using the <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a> makes sense in this deck even with the <strong>downside of paying life points</strong> because you want to send your <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> Starters to the GY if they come in the Starting Hand and also because the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> can be Ritual Summoned from the GY with Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> so you don't lose card advantage by being the best <strong>consistency card option available</strong>. The trick for you <strong>not to take too much damage</strong> in the resolution of the <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a> and not being able to <strong>activate the effects of the Vampire monsters later</strong> is you start activating the Continuous Spell <a data-name=""Vampire's Domain"">Vampire's Domain</a> or Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> and setting the Spell <a data-name=""Vampire's Desire"">Vampire's Desire</a> or <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> and giving Normal Summon the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Samurai Skull"">Samurai Skull</a> to <strong>have in hand only the cards that will be discarded to the GY</strong> avoiding taking 4k or 5k damage.  <a data-name=""Jack-o-Bolan"">Jack-o-Bolan</a> also has the function of sending his <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> <strong>Starters to the GY</strong> and he also has the synergy of being <strong>able to Reborn one of the Zombie monsters on the opponent's turn</strong> for you to generate field presence/Follow Up and even interaction if Reborn from <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> while Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> is activated. This Monster Reborn effect is very useful for even you to bring the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> back to the field which is a 2400ATK monster that will be difficult for the opponent to take out of the field which makes the <strong>protection effect of RANK-6</strong> <a data-name=""Dragonlark Pairen"">Dragonlark Pairen</a> alive and will still make it possible to make <strong>more RANK-6 plays</strong> on the return turn.  Tip: Whenever you are going to use the effect of <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a>, <strong>never choose ""Trap"" because all decks in the format use</strong> <a data-name=""Paleozoic"">Paleozoic</a> <strong>Traps</strong> and choosing <strong>""Monster"" is also a bad choice</strong> given how many excellent cards the vast majority of decks wants to send to the GY so the best option is to <strong>force him to send ""Spells""</strong> because that's the least that will generate an advantage if his deck manages to use it.  The <strong>RANK-6 you always want to do first</strong> in the deck is <a data-name=""Dragonlark Pairen"">Dragonlark Pairen</a> because it will simply <strong>Reborn the</strong> <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> Starters during the <strong>next two Standby Phases</strong> for you to quickly gain advantage in addition to <strong>protecting itself from destruction by battle or card effect while a GY Special Summoned Monster is on the field</strong> making it a very difficult card to deal with.  /////////////////////////////////////"

The bulk of the deck is comprised of the VW strategy going trying to get out crystal wing and dragoon (caliga would be a suitable replacement if you want cards in hand for next turn plays). The P.U.N.K engine here allows for Gabu to be added to hand and can either set up a VW name on board or set up gossip before 5 summons. The swordsoul engine allows easy access to baronne and crystal wing if VW line gets shut down. Tons of options and varying combos make playing the deck fun and different almost every game. Please let me know what you think and if you have any advice! Thank you.

Red Dragon Archfiends focus on Synchro Spamming through their sub-archetype ""Resonators,"" which were also used by Jack in the anime, with non-Tuners and backrow to boot. This particular build utilizes the advantage that the ""Rokket"" cards provide. Rokket Tracer can serve as a Tuner or as a non-Tuner by destroying itself to Special Summon Rokket Recharger, whose effect itself can be helpful in the duel, and can serve as a smaller Tuner by destroying itself to Special Summon Rokket Synchron, which is also useful for extension and recovery. Rokket Tracer is also excellent for combo'ing with the Spells or useless Resonators, as you can destroy them to Special Summon Recharger and make an easy Level 8 Synchro.  The best end boards are always gained through the help of Crimson Resonator. Crimson Resonator is an insanely powerful card that Special Summons itself if you control no monsters, which saves your Normal Summon for an extender or just a Level 4 for the Synchro Summon of Red Rising Dragon. Red Rising Dragon is a very valuable part of the deck, as it is a Level 6 Synchro which is easy to make through a Level 2 Resonator and a level 4 non-Tuner like Wildwind. Red Rising Dragon's effect revives a Resonator from the Graveyard, most likely the one you used for its Synchro Summon, allowing you to immediately go for another Synchro Summon, usually for Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend of Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon.  Chaos Ruler is great because none of the good Synchros require specifically a Red Dragon Archfiend, instead requiring any DARK Dragon Synchro Monster, and Chaos Ruler can mill 5 upon Summon. This is an amazing effect because Synkron Resonator and Wandering King Wildwind are both DARKs you can add back from the effect, you can recycle dumped Resonators with Synkron or any dumped card with Burning Soul, and I would hate to fail to mention that milling Red Reign will allow you to add it right to your hand on your next Synchro Summon. Milling ""The Great Soul"" also gives you access to a negation of an opponent's monster effect that activates anywhere, and the fact that it's a Trap and banishes itself from the Graveyard as cost makes it even stronger, as most opponents would need to already have an omni-negate present on their field in order to negate it, and this strengthens your chains with Supernova, Red Reign, and Abyss disruptions.  When going first, provided that you didn't brick (which happens a lot, albeit less frequently with this build than with others), you should be able to make Red Rising Dragon, hopefully with a Crimson Resonator to revive. Then you can use Crimson Resonator to Special Summon a Synkron Resonator and a Creation Resonator from Deck, then you can use your three Tuners and your non-Tuner Synchro Monster to Synchro Summon the almighty Red Supernova Dragon. Even by himself, he can be a game-ender if the opponent doesn't have the resources to bait his effect out before making their main plays. However, it's usually possible to secure a Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss alongside him for added security.  Alternatively, if you've drawn a hand that can make Red Supernova Dragon, and you've drawn Burning Soul, you can prevent your opponent from playing the game. Simply make Red Rising Dragon once more using Crimson Resonator and Special Summon your Synkron and Creation Resonators. Alternatively, if you have a copy of The Great Soul, or a Trap Trick to gain access to one, then all you need is the Crimson Resonator, or even just a Red Resonator. Now, instead of making Supernova, make Scarlight or Chaos Ruler. Chaos Ruler is usually preferred, since you can potentially score a DARK monster, Red Reign, or The Great Soul off of the mill. Set Burning Soul and maybe a Trap Card, then end your turn.  At the start of your opponent's Main Phase 1, activate Burning Soul. Add whatever card to your hand, then perform your Synchro Summon, tuning your Level 1 and 3 Resonators to your Level 8 DARK Dragon Synchro Monster to Synchro Summon the also almighty Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King of All Mouthfuls - <em>ahem</em> - King Calamity. Just like another monster with Calamity in its name (or rather the plural version), this monster makes it so your opponent cannot play the game by preventing them from activating cards or the effects of cards on their fields. On top of this, it's a Spell Speed 4 effect, meaning it cannot be responded to with any card of the game. Now all your opponent can do is Set a monster and maybe some backrow and pray to whatever deity they worship that you don't have a hand coherent enough to kill them next turn, which seems a little optimistic, given you added a card from your Graveyard to your hand, you're drawing another card, and you likely have a Wildwind and/or a Red Rising Dragon to activate for more advantage.  Of course, this list is not 100% perfect. Some ratios can be adjusted to fit how you'd like to play. I've experimented with things like Dawnwalker, Duskwalker, and the Assault Mode package for easy Synchros, adding more Chaos cards like Chaos Valkyrie which is an easy-to-summon Level 4 and a LIGHT for recurring Chaos Ruler, and much, much more. This is simply the easiest, most reliable version of the deck that I've made thus far. I hope this is helpful for your future duel-ruling endeavors, Kings."

Evo-Singularity is actually such a good card it’s worth playing three trap trick alone for this incredible trap. Here’s how it works.  You pay the cost of targeting an Evoltile and an Evolsaur in your graveyard, summon an Evolzar from your extra, then attach the monsters targeted as material. It’s that simple, you can get a free boss, you get to choose from one who can get two monster negates, one who can stop two summons, or one who can Omni negate.  Then you support those monsters by backrow! This combination can overwhelm opponents pretty quickly and good enough hands can beat some really good decks."

Idea is to adopt a duel strategy of searching and drawing Exodia pieces. Use torrential tribute to destroy your own monsters if your opponent won't do it, especially useful when combined with double summons. If your opponent does manage to summon a heavy-hitter - mystic mine will lock them to an extent, allowing you time to gather the pieces. Swift scarecrow can also be your last line of defence.  Always magic mallet if you do not have any Exodia pieces in hand. The only cards you don't want to shuffle back in with a mallet on the first turn is trader/supply-squad/tribute.  Probably the most OP card is draw of fate - lets you stack 3 pieces of exodia on top and if you have a cardcar in hand."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.
