So one could say that they've leapt the Dragon Gate. What does that mean? Lemme explain.  &nbsp;  In Chinese mythology, there is a gate called Dragon Gate on top of a waterfall in the Yellow River. Many carp try to swim upstream and leap over the waterfall, but few are strong or brave enough to do this. If a carp manages to jump over the waterfall and reach the Dragon Gate, they will be transformed into a powerful dragon. This is so famous in China that ""trying to leap Dragon Gate"" means suddenly improving your social status.  &nbsp;  In light of that and how Marincess went from good to great, this deck is named ""Marincess Dragon Carp.""  &nbsp;  As for this deck, it does better going first, but thanks to the 12 hand traps this deck plays, it can be decent if it has to go second. Your strategy is to set up as many disruptions as you can, and this deck can end on a board consisting of Aqua Argonaut summoned with Marincess Crystal Heart, Toadally Awesome, Battle Ocean, and a Marincess Wave or two."

But seriously it is a contender for the wackiest deck out there. You take advantage of world chalice cards and Venus to make some insane link plays which includes ending on a board with 6 negates and a true king of calamity. Atleast thats the dream typcially you can get a 4 stack apo with DPE or true king out fairly easily with the deck which in alot of games is enough to end the game. The deck is also very fun to play as each game feels like a new journey/path needed to get the win. So if you enjoy puzzles give the deck a try.

They are cool-looking 2. I genuinely love the deck based on what they are and their lore  But either way, Swordsouls main goal is to bring out their main Synchro boss monsters, Chengying, Qixing Longyuan, and Baronne (the rest is for just in case and negaters) This is my own personal take on Swordsouls and honestly I love it. Before I forget, I only have the Psy monsters in the side deck and Framelord in the Extra deck is so I can find a good way in between duels to get Framelord out with its negates in between duels  Tenyi are known for their great support for many monsters and their strong monsters with Synchros as well as the Yang Zings  And remember, This is your friendly Duelist going through Battle City, Ultra/Echo, and until then Duelists...

You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!!!!!  It's all mirror force, plus a little extra. There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps."

This deck heavily relies on your monster effects to bring out many Link Monsters and attempt to summon strong Borrel Dragons to negate and stop your opponent from play. Though I barely see this deck ever, I wanted to make it since it was my first ever deck in Master Duel and I loved it since it was so powerful.  I really hoped you guys enjoy this deck because again, I love this archetype and would love to change it from time to time, or just help you guys on your preferences.

A lot of the cards in this deck are hit in other formats, but the engine is basically untouched in Master Duel - the third Rocksies is a Rock Deck hit, not a Pranks engine hit at all.  I decided to try and splice in DPE, and couldn't quite cut it to 40. Still experimenting with the list, this is one I didn't play in the regular format so even though I know what is strong about it I'm not adept at building Pranks lists yet. I think DPE is either worth it or obligatory, but I'm eschewing not to run Scythe, because I think there's more counterplay to it than people realize floating around, and I want cards that will gain me points against skilled opponents where I need them, rather than aiming for easier wins against unskilled opponents. Could be wrong - the right matches and Scythe is truly broken. But it also depends on making DPE all of the time, whereas here it is just a nice option when you see Fusion Destiny or overextend or get stopped."

So it's time we expiriments for efficient alternatives ,"Video link in the description below  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/QsIAPSEuwlU"">https://youtu.be/QsIAPSEuwlU</a> )  It's still amusing how we're on the way into being already 6 months into the Albaz Strike's release date, and Branded-Despia still holds on as a top spot for the current metagame. Don't get me wrong though, I do love how fluent and flexible this fusion deck can be; but the main problem out of all this time playing it comes from how it runs out of gas too quickly. How does it run out of gas so quickly? The answer comes from the main deck and not from the Extra Deck, where you have pieces from Branded-Despia such as <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a>. So today I'm going to do a little experiment that adds a little extra fuel that doesn't cost an arm or a leg, but actually has something to utilize in its own way.  &nbsp;  Hence why I will be using an archetype known as *The Agents,* an archetype that usually utilizes in the cards <a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a> and <a data-name=""Master Hyperion"">Master Hyperion</a>. Why did I choose them over something like the *Thunder Dragons* or even a singular card like <a data-name=""Fairy Tail-Snow"">Fairy Tail-Snow</a>? To be reassuring, *The Agents* are an archetype that are both light/dark attribute; have searchers/millers that can be useful in extensional fusions for <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> and even <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a> (such as <a data-name=""The Agent of Life - Neptune"">The Agent of Life - Neptune</a>); and can take full advantage of their own effects if <a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a> is on the field (such as <a data-name=""The Agent of Mystery - Earth"">The Agent of Mystery - Earth </a>and its effect that searches <a data-name=""Master Hyperion"">Master Hyperion</a> if the field spell is on the field). Arguably, it does seem unorthodox considering that most of the time you want most of your fusion resources (that aren't <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia </a>or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>) in your GY; however it isn't always the case you need to build up your boards immediately on hand at the fastest rate possible (which if the disruption occurs could result in a hard time replacing the pieces you already used too quickly). Finally there is the new link monster (known as <a data-name=""Proctector of the Agents - Moon"">Proctector of the Agents - Moon</a>) which basically tributes any agent monster on the field (such as Earth, Uranus, and itself) to pop a card on the field, and on summon can add earth from your deck or GY to the hand.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You can easily summon it by using gizmek and the danger cards effects. Also focus on banishing as many cards from the extra and normal deck to then be able to utilize gren maju effect to its max.

SO not playing this card is indeed bruh  Marincess Sleepy Maiden: you can sp this card from your hand by targeting the Marincess card you have and it can not be destroyed by card effect the importance of this card is allows you to play after getting hand traped also you can target your field spell and sp her.  one for one with Testudo Erat numen: basically the only card that saves you from kaiju  now some main points ( if I summon Erat I can't play my own combos ) don't worry you can use Marincess aqua Argonaut to return Erat to hand with one card your opponent controls to hand and guess what after you finished your combo ns Erat again and don't worry about getting destroyed by battle Marincess aqua Argonaut has effect says your opponent can't attack other monsters you have except this one so if you draw one for one it's gg and game over for your opponent.

Built around Vampire Kingdom unlike of the usual Zombie World build.,"<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"">I like playing pure vampire because every vampire playaer seems to be on some sort of Zombie World package. So this is dedicated for all you purists out there. The deck is like fun casual deck but can surprise even meta decks. Especially when going first because it can search an omni negate counter trap which is always strong. I think the vampire deck plays a lot like salamangreat. Putting up couple of strong negates and can recover using graveyard. No overly complicated and long combos. The weak point of the deck is Vampire Ghost Ogre. Ash blossom on it can just stop your entire turn. Though you can add extenders like Vampire's Desire to try and keep going.</span>  https://youtu.be/-4zAkK_IQkE"

Youtube link inside","<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto""> I've consistently reached Platinum/Diamond 1 with this deck for several seasons already, so I thought I would share it!</span>  If you want a detailed explanation how to use this deck, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/generaider-windwitch-july-2021/"">click here.</a>  This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.  While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.  I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!  Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!  The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell). This weakness is avoided with Pot of Prosperity and Maxx ""C"" functioning as cards that will get you starters for the deck.  If you ever use this deck in Master Duel, I hope you enjoy piloting it as much as I do! GLHF Duelists!  "

This deck can comfortably play though interruption and deal with threats on board, especially with the right cards in hand. A central crux of this deck's strategy is turboing out Chaos Ruler to mill 5 to the GY + get a light/dark monster.  This deck is extremely expensive since it's 60 cards and mostly made out of SR/UR rarity, do don't make this deck in Masterduel unless you have deep pockets or you already own the cards. Regardless, this deck is super fun to pilot and extremely competent on ladder!"

It also helps you recycle your one of Naturia monsters, except Naturia Ladybug (for the purposes of which I'll discuss later), but in order to maximize this card's use, you'd also need Naturia Spring Breeze.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Rosewhip&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Rosewhip</strong></a> - <span>This is a card that I don't really know how to feel about.

Also, Naturia Beast and Naturia Barkion already can fulfill that role already, so I don't know. I might cut this in future testings. It's good for turn 3+, but it doesn't help me set up going first or second.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Cosmobeet&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Cosmobeet</strong></a> - <span>A searchable extender, I've decided to play only 1 of this for that reason. It's a low Level Tuner, I suppose, but that's really all it has going for it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Sunflower&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Sunflower</strong></a> - <span>Mandatory 1 of. Naturia Beast covers Spells, Naturia Barkion covers Traps, this and Naturia Camellia covers all monster effect activations of your opponent, which is not hard to set up with Naturia Sacred Tree.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Ladybug&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Ladybug</strong></a> - <span>This card is crazy. This is basically a Level Eater for Naturias whenever you Synchro Summon a Naturia monster. It's great for both Synchro and Link climbing.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Molcricket&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Molcricket</strong></a> - <span>The other new Naturia support. It's a half Rescue Rabbit going 1st, unless you get Gamma-d, and full going 2nd. It also Special Summons itself if your opponent summons a monster from the Extra Deck, or if you summon a Naturia monster from your Extra Deck (it doesn't have to be a Synchro Monster). Great for both setting up and follow up.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• The Vernalizers (EARTH Fairies)</strong> - <span>The complementary search engine for your Deck. They actually work great with Naturia, it sucks that they xenolock you into EARTHs though but hey, I guess you can't have everything. Their effects are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Qardan the Great Sage&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Qardan the Great Sage</strong></a> - <span>NOT a Vernalizer nor a Naturia card, originally part of Ishizu's EARTH Fairies (at least I think so). This is a searchable one of, and is most likely your preferred Normal Summon, since it allows you to set a Naturia Sacred Tree from your hand or GY which can be activated immediately, after sending it there to search a ""Naturia"" card from your Deck, except a copy of itself. It also lets you protect your Naturia Sacred Tree from destruction until the end of the next turn if it's sent to the GY.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer Foolish Burial for EARTHs.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer archetypal omni-searcher.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Flowers and Fields&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Flowers and Fields</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer Monster Reborn for EARTHs.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze</strong></a> - <span>The new Vernalizer card, that is a searcher for EARTH Fairies. This is how you get Qardan the Great Sage, after searching it with Hills and Blooms. I only play 2, originally I played 3 but I figured I can manage with less copies.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>• </strong><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;One for One&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>One for One</strong></a> - <span>Great one of for searching either Naturia Molcricket or Naturia Ladybug.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></strong> - <span>For Naturia Sacred Tree.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>Great for decks that need help establishing GY set up.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> - <span>This originally wasn't here, but I figured to add it because it's a sacky one of extender.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></strong> - <span>Search power, I'm actually a bit iffy about this one too but, better have it than not. Feel free to cut this if you don't like it btw.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - <span>Defense.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Spring Breeze"">Naturia Spring Breeze</a></strong> - <span>The third new Naturia support. A Quick-Play Spell that allows you to either Special Summon a Naturia monster from your hand or GY (which includes any of the Synchros or Exterio), or either Synchro Summon or Fusion Summon during your opponent's turn. My only Fusion target here is Naturia Exterio, because Naturia Gaiastrio only protects from cards and effects that targets EXACTLY 1 CARD, and requires you to have a card in hand to negate its activation, so yeah.</span></span>  <span><strong>Trap, without an ""s"", because I only play 1.</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a></strong> - <span>You wanna send this card to the GY as soon as possible, because it's the omni-searcher for the Deck. It also has an effect that lets you set up during your opponent's turn with negates and interruptions by Tributing either a Plant or Insect-type Level 4 or lower Naturia monster to summon another one with the other Type from the Deck. 2 is fine, in case you draw one.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a></strong> - <span>The secret boss of the Deck. This deck can actually play 2 of this, which is funny. It's a Fusion of both Naturia Beast and Naturia Barkion, that negates a the activation of an opponent's Spell/Trap by banishing 1 card from your GY then milling 1 off the top of your Deck, which is not only a better version of both but also makes sense thematically. Also, this is why I'm siding 3 Waking the Dragons at my Side Deck lol.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen"">Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</a></strong> - <span>It's a walking Macro Cosmos that doesn't hurt you because you mostly pay cost by either milling your Deck or banishing from your GY. Also, it's a generic Level 9 that can come back for later purposes.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Leodrake"">Naturia Leodrake</a></strong> - <span>Oh man, I just wish you were better. The only relevant thing about it is that it's a second Level 9 (not even generic btw) and a Naturia monster by name. Naturias really need a new Synchro boss monster because Leodrake is just not enough by modern day standards.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>I'm not gonna lie, I never really see this coming up that much. I'm actually considering cutting this because I'm not playing <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Baronne De Fleur&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Baronne De Fleur</strong></a></span> anyway. I mean, it's a neat monster negate with a combat effect, I suppose.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>I mean, if you can make it, might as well, am I right? If Vernalizers didn't xenolock you into EARTHs, this would've been great with <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;XX-Saber Gottoms&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>XX-Saber Gottoms</strong></a></span> and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Cloudcastle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Cloudcastle</span></strong></a> for either <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</span></strong></a> or the other Rank 9 that I chose to play instead.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Landoise"">Naturia Landoise</a></strong> - <span>Landoise... is not that bad. It's just not great. It's good enough to be a one of, since it can cover your opponent's monster effect activations at a cost of sending 1 Spell card from your hand to the GY.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Barkion"">Naturia Barkion</a></strong> - <span>It's the third boss monster, kinda, of the Naturia. It covers your opponent's Trap card activations at a cost of banishing 2 cards from your GY.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a></strong> - <span>Probably the most well-known Naturia monster (aside from Bamboo Shoot and Pineapple) for actually good reasons. It's a semi-generic Level 5 Synchro Monster, which isn't hard to make, and if my memory serves me right I think it got errata'd, but regardless, it covers your opponent's Spell card activations at a cost of milling the top 2 cards of your Deck.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></strong> - <span>My Rank 9 of choice, since I can't play the hand loop version. It's an Invoked Mechaba but it detaches instead of discarding a corresponding material with the same card type in response to the activation of a card or effect to negate its activation. Plus, it's an EARTH monster.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>After a pretty short deliberation, I've decided to go with the ol' reliable Avramax as my Link 4 of choice, with</span> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Borrelsword Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong></a> <span>as the close second, and</span> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Accesscode Talker&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Accesscode Talker</strong></a> <span>as the initial choice for the following reasons: Borrelsword doesn't have targeting protection but can provide massive damage, and Accesscode doesn't have any protection at all and will only get 2 pops at most with its effect. If I want to have a beat stick, I might as well get one that also protects itself.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a></strong> - <span>Probably unironically your best Link monster, if you really bricked that hard.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></strong> - <span>I mean, I'm playing Avramax. Can't have one without the other. At this point I'm really struggling not to use both of them in any of my decks. They're just so good together, and I can't pass up the opportunity.</span> </span>  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong> </span>  <span>Side deck can be consisted of whatever you want. Either any <span><strong><a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Kaiju</a></strong></span> + <span><strong><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll</a></strong></span> or <strong><span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a></span></strong> + <strong><span><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Lancea</a></span></strong> can work. <span><strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a></strong></span> or <span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">DRNM</a></strong></span>, it's up to you. <span><strong><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong></span> or <span><strong><a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong></span>/<span><strong><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">TT</a></strong></span>/<span><strong><a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong></span>, your choice. I just played <span><strong><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a></strong></span> because it's funny and I play 2 Exterio.</span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>I haven't really had any fun outside of non-Fusion decks in a while, and I just love decks that shit on Sky Strikers. It's just a good time. I still think that Naturias could use a new Synchro boss monster though. Since Naturias don't restrict you into anything I think I'll go test this deck more, probably to see if it could work with my Fusion decks since the only thing that xenolocks me into anything are the Vernalizers or if I could run it at 42+ cards instead and still be just as consistent or even more, possibly. Overall, I'm satisfied with this deck so far and I'm glad to see Naturia get love after all these years. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: I've edited the list since I didn't notice that <a data-name=""Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze"">Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze</a> are not appearing. I also made some slight list adjustments relative to what ratios I'm playing currently, but it doesn't change the philosophy of the list.</span>"

Swordsoul monsters with the maindeck Tenyis enable numerous synchro summons and pushes into established boards. Deck can go first or second really well and can play through numerous disruptions. Deck count is pretty high but I think this deck doesn't mind the large deck size due to its overall consistency. Extra deck is kind of standard I think but Dragite is my ""flex spot"". Could be Crimson Blader, Psychic End Punisher, or Draco Masters of the Tenyi potentially. Side deck is subject to change based on metagame and things I want to try, mostly trying to focus on ""board breaking"" going 2nd cards. Flex spot would be the ghost mourners I suppose but they're decent against token collector. Other options could be Forbidden Chalice or Rivalry of Warlords  Any constructive criticism or suggestions welcome!"

Dragon Link Deck - Master Duel (TCG Legal),"<span>Buster Blader Dragon Link renewed! After actually playing it for a little while, I've added and taken away things and this is my current list. This is legal in TCG too, which is why I like this deck so much and plan to actually purchase it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>➥ Monsters:</span>  <span>• 3× Buster Whelp: Whelp searches Prologue, which starts your Buster Blader fusion play. Its also just good material for Striker Dragon, so you don't have to pop Striker to return the Rokket to hand. </span>  <span>• 1× Dragon Buster Destruction Sword: Your extra deck lock that gets equipped to Buster Blader by Buster Dragon. You can send this to the GY by any way you want, whether it be by discarding, link material, foolish burial, dragon ravine or whatever. It's also nice to have a level 1 tuner that can summon itself, as on your turn after equipping it you can use it and the Buster Dragon to go into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss for a negate.</span>  <span>• Rokket Synchron: Just a good one-of, a solid normal summon and is also just another name for Boot Sector and Rokket Tracer.</span>  <span>• 2× Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: It's Ash, why wouldn't you run it?</span>  <span>• 1× White Dragon Wyverburster and 1× Black Dragon Collapserpent: Solid self-summons that search eachother and are targets for Chaos Space. </span>  <span>• 1× Rokket Recharger and 1× Silverrokket Dragon: Just good level 4's and once again just more names for Tracer and Boot Sector.</span>  <span>• 3× Rokket Tracer: The best Rokket in the deck. Targets a card to pop to summon another Rokket from deck, and is a level 4 tuner to allow for easy level 8 Synchros. </span>  <span>• 1× Starliege Seyfert: I run just 1 Seyfert for space reasons, and I just search for Collapserpent. The GY effect is also really useful for when you want something like Borreload or Chaos Ruler back in the ED. </span>  <span>• 1× Fallen of Albaz: This is your Hieratic summon target to go into Sprind.</span>  <span>• 2× Buster Blader the Destruction Swordsman: Buster Blader himself. I use the retrain because he has a better effect than the original, and I don't use Buster Whelps effect to summon it from the hand or Destruction Swordsman Fusion for the Super-Poly type effect. </span>  <span>• 1× Absorouter Dragon: It can special summon itself and has a great GY effect, not much else to say. Searches for your combo pieces, and is your main Foolish or Dragon Ravine target.</span>  <span>• 2× Noctovision Dragon: Another card with a really easy Special Summon, and goes +1 when sent to the GY for link material, which is just amazing. It can also protect your traps with it's first effect, but that doesn't come up very often.</span>  <span>• 1× Chaos Dragon Levianeer: A free pop-2 on summon, and also a big body on the field. It's also searchable through Chaos Space, which is nice.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>➥ Spells &amp; Traps</span>  <span>• 2× Chaos Space: This is mainly to search for Wyverburster or Collapserpent, but can also search for Levianeer if you want. The GY effect is also really nice. It applies to Extra Deck monsters too, as they can't be Normal Summoned/Set, so you don't need Wyverburster/Collapserpent banished for it to work. </span>  <span>• 1× Foolish Burial: This is to send Absorouter or Dragon Buster, whichever you want. It lets you skip a whole step in the combo process. </span>  <span>• 1× Dragon Ravine: Searchable through Romulus and can send Absorouter or Dragon Buster by discarding 1. The discard cost is also helpful sometimes, as you can send Memories if you hard drew it, or Absorouter / Dragon Buster if you drew those too.</span>  <span>• 1× Boot Sector Launch: Searchable through Striker Dragon and can put Rokkets on the field for free. Pretty self explanatory.</span>  <span>• 3× Quick Launch: A free summon from the Deck and it's not even once per turn. Insanely good as you can summon literally anything you need. </span>  <span>• 1× Called By The Grave: Just nice to have, can stop some handtraps or other plays if you banish the right card. </span>  <span>• 2× Destruction Sword Memories: This is to be sent by Prologue for it's GY effect to banish Fusion materials for the Buster Blader fusion.</span>  <span>• 3× Prologue Of The Destruction Swordsman: This 1 trap allows for a 2-turn monster lockdown. Send Memories and Buster Blader to grave, chain Memories and summon both the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon to change all enemy monsters to Dragons. </span>  <span>• 2× Trap Trick: These serve as extra copies of either Prologue or Red Reign. That's about it</span>  <span>• Red Reign: A great field wipe that also protects your remaining monsters. It also comes back from the GY really easily, so it's constantly accessible. You can run Destruction Sword Flash instead of this if you want, but I prefer Red Reign because it's applicable more often, protects your monsters and comes back to your hand from the GY should a Dark Dragon be Sunchro Summoned (literally any Synchro in this deck). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>➥ Extra Deck: </span>  <span>• 2× Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman: Your main man, he locks down all Dragons, does piercing, and can easily reach super high ATK.</span>  <span>• 1× Sprind, the Irondash Dragon: your Albaz target after summoning him via Hieratic. Bounce 1 with Hieratic, yoink the other with Albaz to go into Sprind. </span>  <span>• 2× Busted Dragon: This card lets you lock down any opponent field even if they're not dragons, by forcing them into becoming dragons. It also equips Dragon Buster from grave to lock your opponents ED.</span>  <span>• 1× Borreload Savage Dragon: Pretty simple, the best generic Synchro in the game with a once per turn omni-negate and easy access to Link monsters in grave. </span>  <span>• 1× Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon: Mills and searches for extending potential on summon, and can come back from GY by banishing a Light and a Dark. Just a really solid level 8 to go into. </span>  <span>• 1× Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss: Once again just another really easy to access monster with a negate. It can also summon a tuner from grave after damaging your opponent, which can come up fairly often. </span>  <span>• 1× Guardragon Pisty: Sometimes useful, but you can cut it if you really want. Not really necessary but I have found I've needed it in very specific situations. </span>  <span>• 1× Striker Dragon: Searches for Boot Sector and can add a Rokket from grave to hand by popping itself. Pretty simple and really good.</span>  <span>• Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres: like a better version of Knightmare Unicorn. Bounces one and can summon Albaz from deck for another yoink. </span>  <span>• 1× Dragunity Knight - Romulus: Searches Dragon Ravine on summon, and its second effect can come up every once in a while. Once again pretty simple</span>  <span>• 1× Quadborrel Dragon: This is for when you don't have the best hand or misplay. 1 Rokket Tracer can become a 2-negate Borreload Savage because of this card. And once again the discard cost is kinda nice sometimes. </span>  <span>• 1× Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman: It can help sometimes when you misplay because its materials are generic, but it also serves as a way to garuntee Dragon Buster or Memories is in the GY.</span>  <span>• 1× Borrelsword Dragon: I like it more than Accesscode, and it fits the Rokket theme as it's in-archetype, plus it's got really good OTK potential. </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span>Its a lot, but it's a deck with a LOT of tiny moving parts you need to keep track of, but it's very very fun regardless.</span>"

Now I've beed Naturia-pilled.  Camellia, Molecricket, Spring Breeze and Sacred Tree form the backbone of an extremely powerful yet unsassuming recursive strategies with the help of Vernalizers. You need to setup so Molecricket is in your GY, then you summon Camellia to dumps Sacred Tree from the deck which searches Spring Breeze, then you revive Molecricket and use it's effect to summon from deck Sunflower. This means your board consists of a repeatable monster negate (Sunflower thanks to Camellia's cost substitution effect), Molecricket can summon Horneedle to destroy anything your opponent special summons and even if you need monster to tribute, Molecricket revives itself to cover the cost. This is just the bare minimum of what the deck does, tho'. Now let's talk about Vernalizers...  Vernalizers pitch any monster from your hand along with themselves to use a specific effect and all revive any earth monster with the only condittion being getting locked into earth monster effects (but not summons, remember that). Essentialy ara a roundabout and costly way to summon monsters from your hand and deck. Forest is the best starter, since it's unique effect is foolish burial for any earth monsters but it won't be revived by its second effect. This translates to Foolish Burial King Regulus so you can revive it with your other Vernalizers. Hills searches any Vernalizer card, mostly the trap, which bounces any number of your opponent's cards as long as you can also bounce earth monsters (this also translates to the possibility of bouncing a Maxx ""C"" you summoned from the GY, but since this a TCG focused list we don't have to worry about that, sorry OCG). Finally, Seedlings adds you any earth fairy monster which means any of the other two Vernalizers. Since both, at the very least, set up your GY you still play them at three. I decided to play Mountains because it unbricks your hands full of Vernalizers, but it can be cut. Now, the real star of the Vernalizers is Vera. She is a Crackdown, Splight Elf and a monster negate (if you have 5 earth monsters on the field, which isn't uncommon) in one. She revives King Regulus during each of your opponent's turns. She is the second pillar of the deck (along with Camellia).  One extra note: remember how I mentioned that you're only locked into earth monster effects? This means that you can still summon Zeus or Baronne since you'll be using their effects during your opponent's turn anyway."

also combos well with </span><b>Abyss Shark.</b></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Because the deck can struggle to play through large amounts of removal or negates this card can remove at least one monster on your opponent's side of the field as long as they can be tributed and so you will never be at a complete disadvantage going second because you can even draw this card in your draw phase turn 2 and it is still as useful where </span><b>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring </b><span>becomes essentially useless.</span></li>  	<li><b>This is the first card you side out if you are going first</b><span> and side back in because you want them in the main deck in case you get stuck going second you will have them as a possibility to save you from your opponents likely established board however if you win the First duel of the match you won't side them out or change anything with your deck generally unless you know a hand trap in your extra deck that affects your opponent more like </span><b>Artifact Lancea </b>would be more useful <span>but unlike these other Hand Traps </span><b>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</b><span> will not lose their effectiveness as often (like if your opponent does not use the thing you locked them out of using with a card like <b>Artifact Lancea</b>) because </span><b>most decks will have a monster on field </b><span>and you can remove it for essentially free.</span></li>  	<li><span>This card can shut down cards like </span><b>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</b><span> or </span><b>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer (neither are in this
