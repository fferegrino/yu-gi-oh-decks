Funny stuff,"Hand rip your opponent for 4 cards, or 5 cards with a revival spell.

Best way to learn scraps is by playing it yourself sense it's very awkward archetype to run by alone. Ending combos are fine, but starting is not always easy. You will have to find alternative routes with some hands, and no amount of pre built combos will help with that. So leave now if you don't like the idea of ""hard work"" or ""trail and error."" This other deck I made takes a bit of a dive into scraps (not much, but better than nothing), so you might want to check it out if you're starting off: https://ygoprodeck.com/pure-scraps-going-first/

I had a lot of inspiration from Infernites sense they have necromancer which basically does the same thing as Scrap Golem. So shout out StardustYgo's channel, the absolute Infernity master

Anyways, I lot of testing went into this. The hands aren't dead extremely often. While it can occasionally evade a hand trap, it has a hard time dealing with Nibiru if you don't draw into signs to force it out with a second hand rip pre-wyvern. That's why a small Dino package with Misc. provides a solid backup plan as well as protection from your opponent's Psy Gammas when starting off.

I'll probably come back to edit this and provide a more detailed explanation, until then, here's a video:

Fallen Paradise for the amazing Pot of Greed and protection of your sacred beast

Fallen Paradise will protect Raviel if you get him out.

Shimmering Scraper is for the OTK and for fallen paradise if you need a Sacred beast to draw additional +2 cards after your draw phase

Opening of the spirit gates can be easily used with Eldlich engine, with cursed eldland. Use cursed eldland to add Golden Lord and use Opening of the spirit gates to bring back a 0/0 monster by discarding Golden Lord, then use Golden Lord effect to bring himself to hand and special summon by sending the cursed eldland you used , and you can discard any golden land/ Golden Lord with cursed eldland 2nd effect.  Then since Golden Lord is a lvl10 on the field, you can use Opening of the spirit gates 3rd effect, to add Cursed Eldland from your GY to your hand.

Darkest Diabolos is an easy card to get out and makes your opponent send a card from their hand back to their deck.

Metal Reflect slime/ Egyptian God Slime can be used for rank 10 xyz spam....Fusion material to bring out Phantasm Emperor....to summon Shimmering Scapper (if needed for Fallen paradise) or just for flat out protection for your other monsters on the field.

Sacred Beast awakening has 4 effects. you are mainly using the +1 &amp;+2 effects and the last effect. +1 effect gives you life points if a Sacred Beast in on your monster zone, and each time your opponent summons/special summons, Gain life points equal to the monsters' attack. +2 sacred beast on the field basically ""skill drains"" your opponent side of the field and you still gain the +1 effect. The last effect states that if you have a lvl 10 (golden lord/Raviel/egyptian god slime) you can add a continuous trap from your graveyard to your hand. I usually add back Metal reflect slime since its an easy lvl 10 and can be recycled over and over again. Easy XYZ 10 spam and you can use Opening of the Spirit gates last effect to recycle a continuous spell card.

1 Greater poly is a great tech card since you do not want to banish everything with Dimension Fusion Destruction and gives the secondary effects to your fusion monster which is Phantasm Emperor (only needs 3 lvl 10's) which isn't protected under Fallen Paradise and the added extra effects goes will with that card. You can always Anaconda either fusion cards anyways so take your pick!

This deck kinda struggles with handtraps so theres +1 called by the grave, +3 gravediggers to deal with them.

The extra deck is mainly to either otk/burn your opponent

basic eldlich engine :

+3 Conq, +2 Hauq, +3 cursed, + 3 Scarlett, +2 Golden Lord

Basic Sacred beast engine:

+3 fallen(i like it at 3), +3 Opening, +3 Beckoning, +3 Summoning, +2 awakening and total of +5 Raviels

Thank you and let me know if you can make it any better!!

So basically 8 negates + your opponent can only activate 1 s/t per turn. Very nice if you go second. I'd say you can get the 8 negate board about 60% of the time. You just need a way to special summon 2 Six Samurais + a counter generator like Temple or Dojo.

Link the 2 Six Samurais for Isolde

Use Isolde to search

Use Isolde 2nd eff to special summon one of the tuners

Link Isolde and tuner for Battle Shogun

Discard your Isolde search for Battle Shogun eff

Search Gateway.

At this point you should have 4 counters on your counter generator. Remove 4 to search Kizan.

Summon Kizan to link arrow pointed to be Battle Shogun to get 4 counters total on board

Remove 4 to search another Kizan

Summon Kizan to link arrow

Overlay for Shadow Shien to link arrow (You should have 8 counters after this)

Remove 4 to search Grandmaster

Summon Grandmaster to link arrow

Remove 4 to search Shinai (Make sure 2 of the counters are from Battle Shogun)

Link for Saryuja using Shadow Shien, Battle Shogun, and Grandmaster

Use Saryuja to summon Shinai (You should have 7 counters)

Remove 4 to search Mizuho

Summon Mizuho by its own eff (You should have 6 counters)

Remove 4 to search another Shinai

Summon Shinai by eff (You should have 5 counters)

Next use Mizuho eff using Shinai as cost to target itself and destroy it

Shinai eff to return the destroyed Mizuho back to hand

Summon Mizuho (You should have 8 counters)

Remove 4 counters to return Shinai from grave

Summon Shinai by eff (You should have 7 counters)

Repeat Mizuho's destruction effect to gain infinite counters or as much as you like. You get 2 counters each time you do it.

Once you get enough counters, summon 1 Kizan and 1 Grandmaster

Use Saryuja, Kizan, Grandmaster, Shinai, and Mizuho as 4 materials for Apollousa

Bring back Mizuho

Summon 2 Kizans overlay into Dugares

Special summon tuner from graveyard.

Use the level 1 tuner + Shinai + Kizan for level 8

Or Level 2 Tuner + Shinai + Mizuho for level 8

Summon Borreload Savage Dragon

Target Saryuja to equip to Savage Dragon.

IF your initial token generator was Dojo, you can remove it to special summon Great Shogun Shien from the deck

Now you have your board. There are more plays you can do. This deck is real fun!"

Deck is still at 44 cards. It's nice having a few extra cards so that I have a better chance not drawing the obvious bricks.

I've taken out Ghost Ogre. I almost never saw it when I wanted/needed to. Even with Emergency Teleport.(Psychic Wheeleder and Tracker are the better targets) I've added in Stained Greives in Ogre's place.

I've taken out Nightmare Unicorn for Unchained Abomination. The spot isn't something I go into a lot. UA is an underrated card in PK IMO. It matches well with Rusty. UA is a card I need to test out more.

I've taken out Red Reboot for Imperial Order. I'm thinking of also putting in two Anti-Spell Fragrance.

I've decided to keep in the Artifact Package in the side deck. I stick by Rusty or Twin Twister to destroy Scythe during your opponent's turn, locking them out of their extra deck. Sanctum puts Scythe at four. Or, it'll give you Lancea if that's what will work best against your opponent.

Like I've said in my previous deck post, there are some very expensive cards. There are replacements for most of them. But the replacements won't obviously be as good as the listed cards.

Forbidden Droplets can be replaced with Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Chalice. Zeus isn't needed for the deck. It's used as a last ditch effort to wipe my opponent's board. Accesscode Talker can be replaced with Apollousa. I know Dragoon is expensive, but there's no good replacement for it. You can take it out entirely and add in some other cards in the main and extra decks that work well with PK.

If there's anything I'd change, it'd be with the choice of hand trap. Ash is a main stay. But Nibiru is still strong this format. It's hard to find room for Nibiru though. The deck I have is thought out and I want to keep it at what it is. That includes the side deck. I don't know what I'd even take out for siding in a couple of Anti-Spell Fragrance. I'm sure I'd be told to take out the Artifact package. But I like playing it.

I filled up all the empty space with all the budget options I could think of, and I've got the entire deck + extra + side to be $150. I discovered that There Can Be Only One is actually decent with this deck, and although it can hinder your plays it oftentimes hinders your opponent more, and you can link off for a knightmare if you want to. The Storming Mirror Forces are in there because the deck is even more fragile without dark ruler no more, infinite impermanence, and especially triple tactics talent, so if you end up stuck a mirror force can save you until the next turn, where hopefully you can go off. It might be a better idea to shave a desires for another mirror force, I'm not sure. I put in only one of the field spell and one terraforming for two copies of it. I hope you find this useful!"

This is not a meta deck, I've been playing dragons since Tyrant Dragon, now, this current format happens to make my deck more viable.

As such, this current format makes very viable to play different flavors of Dragon decks that uses Rokkets and Guardragons with favorable win rates.

I've just picked almost all my favorite Dragon-type monsters out of my binders and put them in a deck that performs decently at locals.

You may already know how Dragon-Link works, so I'll simply add these notes:

Black Metal Dragon and Starliege Seyfert are one-card combo starters that guarantee you at least a Dragoon and a Borreload Savage.

You may also use another extenders to summon an Apollousa before summoning the Guardragons in order to avoid getting Nibbed.

You can remove Beelze and add a 3rd Striker Dragon, a Hot RDA Abyss or Number 38 Hope Harbinger, a 2nd Hieratic Seal or an Unchained Abomination. However, Beelze can be difficult to out as it has some nice protection, it can't be destroyed neither by battle or effects, but can be targeted, thus get rid of in other ways.

I play 3 Rokket Tracer and 2 Rechargers because I have 3 Dark Synchros in the Extra Deck, but you can change those ratios if you plan to play other Extra Deck monsters.

The 3rd Rokket could also work as a wildcard if you plan to switch your Framegear combo with another handtrap trio while side decking. Or also, you can just simply add 2 Starliege Seyfert to play a 44-card deck, or you can replace one Rokket Tracer to play 2 copies of Rokket Tracer and 2 copies of Starliege Seyfert."

#ColossusToOne","So I know a few things. One, Thunder Dragons don’t use the normal summon whatsoever so that leaves it open for things like Gem-Knights who absolutely need their normal summon. Two, Gem-Knights have some thunder monsters and sometimes ask for a thunder monster, like a Thunder Dragon, as a fusion material. Three, both Gem-Knights and Thunder Dragon are fusion decks.

With staple slots too, howwwwwWW","https://youtu.be/-z0hBP38KsU

Watch the combo in the video down below.

After several testing, the main deck Fleur monsters are just an ""okay"" Halqifibrax engine (at least Noble Knight Shield-Bearer is an Ash bait). So we need to play better Halq engine like Deep Sea/Atlantean because it plays through handtraps. We're not using Isolde as our monsters on field won't just be warrior alone, but beast (Horse of The Floral Knights) or beast-warrior (Centaur Mina). Only 1 Horse of The Floral Knights because we already run normal summon like Diva which does a better job than it. Lv3 synchro is there as we will have spare Diva if from Prima Donna search after using Minstrel, Baroness can revive Prima Donna after using the negate then we can make Baroness again using Diva+Neptabyss+Baroness via this lv3 synchro. Overall, it's just a worse Infernoble Knight because it lacks good built-in extender.

PS: The database isnt updated yet, so some cards are invisible here (but visible in EDOpro).

You want to go second with this deck so you can enter battle phase since all the equip cards has battle related effects. Then you have ""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"" which is one of, if not the best field spell for Normal Monsters in general. It allows you to have the Phantasm Spiral traps as hand traps, and can summon a token if your opponent is playing the game as long as you don't have a token (if your opponent gets rid of the token, you can summon it right back!). Next, we have the generic normal monsters/normal monster support, like ""Unexpected Dai"", which allows you to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower normal from your deck. Last but not least, we have the Normal Pendulum Monsters. Even though they are slightly unneeded for this deck, they are a great support tool. For example, ""Dragon Horn Hunter"" can grant a small boost of attack to all Normal Monsters as well as negating battle damage if your opponent targeted a normal monster for battle."

This is mainly accomplished through Toon Black Luster Soldier.

And even if ","This deck focuses on summoning Toon monsters under the effect(s) of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>. These Toon cards can both destroy your opponent's cards with ease, but also be prevented from being destroyed themselves and even attack directly while under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>; a powerful double-edged sword that makes it easy to control the board!

The main card in this deck is <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a>, as it allows you to banish cards from your opponent' side of the field. It's best to summon him under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Toon Dragon"">Red-Eyes Toon Dragon, and </a><a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> as they allow you to special summon Toon cards while ignoring their summoning conditions!

It's fairly easy to get the materials necessary to start dominating the board early thanks to <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a>, <a data-name=""Teraforming"">Teraforming</a>, <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a>, and <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a>, as well as <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> as they allow you to continue cycling your deck and special summon Toon monsters from the deck or your hand.

However, this deck is most powerful when under the effects of <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>, so it will almost always be vital to keep it on the board for as long as possible. That's why this deck also focuses on completely negating common counters to this deck (<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, etc.) through cards such as <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> and <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a>.

Another gimmick to this deck is it's ability to steal opponent's monsters. This can easily be accomplished by <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a>, but can also be done through <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. You can do this to both use your opponent's monsters against them in battle, or even be used to summon Link Monsters such as <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> that will continue allowing you to continue easily dominating the board.

<strong>Gimmicky Combos:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Using <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>'s effect that has you discard a ""Toon"" card, you can discard <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> (even if you've already played a <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> on the same turn) to have more defensive resources to protect your <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>.</li>
 	<li>You can also use <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a> to take control of key monsters on your opponent's side of the field for Tribute, XYZ, or Link Summoning your own monster(s).</li>
 	<li>Abuse the heck out of <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a>'s ability to keep <a data-name=""Toon &lt;a data-name=&quot;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&quot;&gt;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;"">Toon </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>(s) in your deck, as well as <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>s in your hand to keep summoning them!</li>
 	<li>If you already have a god-like hand/board, but have a single <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> in your hand, you can use it to search for the other <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> in your deck until they're all gone, and use the final <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> to get a card you need! That way, you'll be more likely to draw other important cards in your deck that aren't Toon cards so that you can defend your <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom </a>(<a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Use <a data-name=""Toon Page-Flip"">Toon Page-Flip</a> to make your opponent summon a <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a>, <a data-name=""Toon Dark Magician"">Toon Dark Magician</a>, or <a data-name=""Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Toon Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> for you. No matter which one they choose, you can combo the summon into summoning your <a data-name=""Toon Black Luster Soldier"">Toon Black Luster Soldier</a>.</li>
 	<li>You can use <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> to look for <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a>, then use <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> to look for <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>. This way, you already have resources at the ready (i.e. a <a data-name=""Toon Bookmark"">Toon Bookmark</a> in the Graveyard) to counter your opponent if they try to destroy your <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>.</li>

You can swap out super poly with dark ruler no more, ghost ogre with ash blossom, appointer with solemn strike, pot of duality with pot of prosperity, remove terraforming, metaverse, and Emulelf for infinite impermanence, heavy storm duster with cosmic cyclone, and add in apollousa, accesscode, and underworld goddess in the extra.

Es hora de mostrar el poder de la curación. Nuest","Deck creado por: Darklab

<strong>Objetivo:</strong> Aumentar nuestros LP con Red Resonator y transformarlo en daño con Manipulator of Souls. &gt;w&lt;

<strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/JhZ0kBQgS5c &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

<strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>

Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!

<strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>
 	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>
 	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>
 	<li><strong>Kagemucha Knight: </strong>Ya que la mayoría de nuestros guerreros es de nivel 3, al invocar uno de esos, éste se invocará gratis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>
 	<li>Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>
 	<li>Hay dos Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún queda otro.</li>
 	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>
 	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>
 	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Contras:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que le afectan los incrementos de LP del oponente.</li>
 	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>
 	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>
 	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li>

Now with the Despian Fusion Fieldspell card they are even consistent. Both archetyps are dark fairy so good synergy all in all. Try draw as many cards as possible till u have all the materials to fusion into something big. REMEMBER you can't special summon from extra deck after using ""Stigmatika Curtain Rise"" except fusion summoning.

Not so strong going first. Most of the time you will end on a Quaeritis an Dramaturgia.

Going second you can OTK most of the time. Use your field breaking cards like Super Poly (Tragedy is the perfect discard), The First or Zerato (not once per turn raigeki) to finish your opponent off with your beatsticks. Draglubion into Number 100 or The First + Delight/Quaeritis.

If you have any ideas for changes feel free to comment :)"

Synchro is a back up strategy ","This deck is a hybrid build of three or 4 summoning mechanics if you count the kariboh

i’ve updated this deck a bit and bear with me I’m am a budget player so that’s why I have 2 warnings and 1 strike because I just don’t have 3 strike yet but if you have 3 by all means play 3 solemn strike and yes the deck is running a little thicc with 45 cards but I just couldn’t part with some of them but if I were to it would be the crush card and de-fusion. I just have them in there for the memes &#x1f602; and I thought of bumping cards of consonance to 2 but I only have 4 targets so I kept it a 1

also suggestions are appreciated just be aware that (I resent HandTraps)"

Classic Dark Magician Strategy, except dragoon isn't in it because my friends complain about dragoon (which is fair). This deck has a lot of draw power thanks to Spellbook of knowledge and Magicians'  Souls. You can look up any dark magician video (even a duel links video) to see 80% of the combos this deck uses. One combo you may not be familiar with is using Magicians' Souls with Magicians Restage to get a free monster for link summons, drawing 2 and a free spell negate via magician's right hand.

your main goal is to end on the classic dark magician combo with maybe a negate or two depending on what your able to draw. Obviously this deck isn't standing up against anything meta since im not summoning 20+ negates and this is at the end of the day a control deck. But its still fun to play if your opponent isn't playing anything meta.

<strong>Some Card's Purpose in the deck</strong>

imma quickly explain a few cards,
-Magicians' Combination: I wanted to use dark magician girl for the soul servant bonus, and with the draw power this deck already has along with magicians' souls, getting a dark magician in hand/grave along with a dark magician girl isn't too hard. Plus its a continuous omni-negate

-Magicians Right Hand: I don't have dragoon any more to negate harpie's feather duster, or twin twisters, This along with magicians' combination and maybe a dark magician fusion through eye of timaeus is all we have as a counter to those cards. Plus Magicians Right Hand forces them to give up a spell if they wanted to wipe the board with a spell (assuming you have a spellcaster on the field)

-Grand Spellbook Tower: exists as an extra spellbook card to searh for when you use Crowly. If I drew any of the three spellbook cards, then crowley would be useless for the entire duel. I didn't like that so I threw this in here, and now I can go +1 in the standby phase if I used a spellbook card already (Which I probably will have). I'm also now able to recycle my spellbook cards to use later in the duel for more draw power.

-Triple Tactics Talent: I get ash blossomed alot, and I dont like it.

-Magician's Navigation: 90% of the time will be used as a discard, and will only be used on the field If im getting super unlucky and can't draw eternal soul.

-Dark  Magician Girl  Dragon Knight/Dark Paladin:  There is no excuse, I had no idea what to add, and I had an extra extra deck slot. So I was like ""Its a free discard i guess, might as well"" also follows the dark magician + dark magician girl theme. And Dark paladin is a massive beatstick against some decks so... yea replace this with whatever you want

-Palladiums they are in the deck to boost soul servant's draw power, and to use mahad as a searchable dark beat stick. if you draw them at a bad time, or in general, discard them. These are also the main cards you would remove for your side deck choices, they aren't essential for the strategy but they are useable against any deck.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Please don't be too harsh in the comments, I know the deck isn't perfect, I change it almost every week. But Still don't be afraid to give suggestions."

Your main goal is to link summon Vampire Sucker, than use the vampire cards to tribute your opponents monsters while zombie world is on the field. Avendread slayer is usually used to get a vampire in the grave for a play, or to get Banshee in the grave for zombie world, then you make your tributing plays in main phase 2. This is definitely a casual deck, since it can't really play through a lot of negates and also has its biggest weakness being running out of zombie worlds. But overall still fun, I like vampire cards and the newest one can gain alot of advantage using vampire sucker. I'm not going to list combos since I don't really have any big combos, I usually just wing it with this deck.  If you have any suggestions for this deck without changing the core theme of Vampire  Zombie World, I'd love to hear them with a reason why."

I think this is the strongest way to play red-eyes as of this date (if u ignore dragoon as a red-eyes deck). The main strategy is to win by burn damage through summoning as many Red-Eyes Metal Flare Dragons as possible on turn 1. If its turn 2, you try for a beatdown strategy with Dragoon and other big monsters. Its nothing too crazy, can play through a few negates if you have enough extenders, but probably not meta enough to stand up against the toppest of tiers. Some cards can probably be removed to make it more powerful (red-eyes darkness dragon and among other cards) but I played them cuz I think their fun to summon sometimes. And finally, the side deck was thrown together, its probably bad. The deck's biggest weakness is definitely dark ruler no more since it'll shutdown your whole turn 1, and there isn't much you can do to stop that besides side-decking spell/trap negates. I'm open to criticism, I just don't want to change the strategy of summoning 3 Metal flare dragons on turn 1, since thats the whole reason the deck was made.

now that im done rambling, here is your main combo

======================================================================================================================================================================================

<span><strong>Combos:</strong></span>

Turn 1: Black Metal Dragon + Any Level 7 (preferably a Red-Eyes) + 1 Discard
1. Summon Black Metal (normal or special, whichever you can do)
2. Make Striker
3. CL1 search for Boot Sector Launch CL2 Search for Darkness Metal Dragon (this may change order depending on whats in your hand)
4. Banish Striker to summon Darkness Metal
5. Special summon Black metal using Darkness Metal's effect
6. Make Romulus, CL1 search for Ravine CL2 Search for Red-Eyes Insight
7. Activate Ravine, and Discard 1 card, and Mill Absorouter
8. Search for Rokket Tracer
9. Activate Boot Sector Launch and Special summon Rokket Tracer
10. Activate Rokket Tracer and destroy your boot Sector launch to special summon Rokket synchron
11. Make elpy
12. activate Romulus to special summon the level 7 in your hand
13. make pitsy
14. using pitsy to special summon absorouter from your graveyard
15. XYZ into a Metal Flare dragon
16. Activate Red-Eyes insight, mill a Red-Eyes normal monster, and search for anything except red-eyes fusion
17. activate Metal flare and detach your level 7 to special summon the red-eyes in the graveyard
18. activate elpy to special summon tempest
19. XYZ into another Metal Flare Dragon

======================================================================================================================================================================================

by now your board should be an elpy, a pisty, a romulous, and two metal flare dragons (one with 2 material and the other with 1). Your hand should be 2 cards and a red-eyes spell/trap Depending on what you have there are many routes you can go from here.

======================================================================================================================================================================================

-If the level 7 was a red-eyes (or if you found some way to get extra red-eyes in the graveyard)
20. you can Link away pisty and elpy to make galaxy satelite dragon
21. then link away satelite and romulous to make predaplant verte anaconda
22. then activate your second metal flare dragon to detach Tempest and special summon a red-eyes from your graveyard
23. Activate tempest in the graveyard and banish pisty and elpy (or two other dragons doesn't rlly matter) to special summon itself
24. XYZ summon your third Flare metal dragon.
25. activate anaconda and special summon Dragoon
26. Set whatever card you searched for with insight
27. End your turn with 3 Metal Flare Dragons, A Dragoon, a Predaplant, Red-Eyes Spell/Trap with 2 cards in hand.

-If the level 7 was not a red-eyes
20. you can Link away pisty and elpy to make galaxy satelite dragon
21. then link away satelite and romulous to make predaplant verte anaconda
22. activate anaconda and special summon Dragoon
23. Set whatever card you searched for with insight
24. End your turn with 3 Metal Flare Dragons, A Dragoon, a Predaplant, Red-Eyes Spell/Trap with 2 cards in hand.

-If you don't want to or can't summon Dragoon at this moment in time (You require an extra red-eyes in the grave or an extender to do this)
20. Use your extender or Red-Eyes metal flare to get another level 7 or your Rokket synchron on the field
21. Link Pitsy/Elpy with Romulous to make Triple burst dragon
22. link Triple burst with elpy/pisty to link into Darkness Metal
23. Special summon either a level 7 or a Rokket synchron, depending on whichever you are missing
24. Synchro summon your level 7 and rokket synchron to make borreload savage
25. equip triple burst in your grave to borreload savage
26. End Turn with 2 Flare Metals, a Borreload savage, and a Darkness Metal

======================================================================================================================================================================================

<strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>

the extenders in this deck will typically allow you to change up the combo a bit so you can consistently end on 3 Flare metals if you go uninterrupted, but if you are interrupted, you will usually end on 1 if there are a lot of interruptions or 2 if there aren't that many. There are more combos that you will probably just figure out exist when you see some of the test hands yourself. Such as using starliege instead of black metal dragon for a weaker but still effective combo, or using the rokket cards as your method of getting bodies on the board for when you don't have starliege or black metal dragon.

This deck is rlly fun in my opinion, But can struggle with comebacks or playing after your board gets broken, so don't over-extend unless your that sure your opponent won't break your board. If you have any suggestions, put them in the comments with an explanation of why, so I would actually make the changes on my personal deck list and for anyone else who reads them, I won't argue against your opinions or reply to any comments since everyone doesn't have to play the same way. Thanks for reading.

and yes I agree Red-Eyes Darkness dragon is a horrible idea and a bad card, I didn't wanna play a one of tech card."

In other words, we have to wait for an official release date. <a>https://mortalkombatpoland.splashthat.com/</a>

<a>AUstralia </a>

a slightly longer answer is that everything can probably be changed at short notice. Some other Warner Bros. movies have skipped theaters and gone straight to streaming. You can rent the thriller ""The Little Things"" on SF Anytime, and stream DC's big movie ""Wonder Woman 1984"" on HBO Nordic. These are titles shown on HBO Max in the United States. <a>https://mortalkombatukraine.splashthat.com/</a>

Other big movies like ""Godzilla vs Kong"" are waiting for their cinema premiere. But the strategy at Warner Bros. and SF Studios right now is to release ""Mortal Kombat"" in theaters as soon as possible, hopefully later this spring. <a>https://themarksmanukraine.splashthat.com/</a>

<a>https://nomadlandpoland.splashthat.com/</a>

Because it premiered on April 28th earlier, if I remember correctly. But how come the US runs the <a>movies</a> in theaters. Do they have different restrictions there now so that more than 8 people can visit the cinemas? Otherwise it should not be profitable for them to keep it open either, you think. In my hometown, however, the cinema is open. But there is hardly any point in them being open when no new premieres come. Now only a few films are shown that have already been seen because they have remained in the cinema for several weeks since the premiere <a>Stream</a>. And it is probably an animated film about a poodle and a Danish film with Mads Mikkelsen they are going to show at the moment. But for some it is not of interest until the film with Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland or Godzilla v Kong goes to the cinema. Then it's Cruella I hope for in May. And a little craving is also on Mortal Combat.
