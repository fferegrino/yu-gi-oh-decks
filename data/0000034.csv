Their server is a baboon tree. They order a cup ramen. But this is a haunted bar. Plant life grows wild, and ghosts wand","A revision of sorts.  With a bit more consistency, and a lot more plays.  Following the same strategy as the old deck, which is to set up a strong board by continuously special summoning monsters out onto the field. I'm sure that the Extra Deck could use a few tweaks, but that's in due time. (Thinking the Insulator for Proxy, to open side zones for more monsters?)  Again, more so a casual deck for fun as opposed to regionals or whatevs, this might be an eye opener, maybe a door opener for further experimentation.  &nbsp;  If I had to give this deck a rating a lá Exordio, then it'd be... Attack: 7 Defense: 8 Consistency: 7 Versatility: 8 Recovery: 5  Sounds about right. You can replace stuff in the extra deck to place in a Utopic Future or even Saryuja, although the latter isn't quite required. Depending on the situation, you can go either Azathot, or just make Future with a Zoo XYZ and Redoer.  This deck is constantly evolving as I get more ideas, so don't be surprised if a V3.0 comes out in the next few days."

Going first is okay if you can set up with Topologic Bomber Dragon, but you need to open kinda busted to get it done properly. Making room for Ash Blossoms wouldn't be too hard, but I like how fast the deck plays without them. Beware big beaters when Full Armor Master is on the board. Blackbird Close and Black-Winged Dragon are only here for meme factors, but have helped in a pinch."

You can run hand traps if you want to, just replace Dinowrestler Pankratops with like Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre or etc. Honestly, you can run whatever XYZ monster that fits well for you but these are the XYZ monsters that I am running and is very effective for me. You don't run a lot of Link monsters since this is an OTK base so you need to focus on the fusion monsters as well. With the instant fusion, honestly you could run whatever. I chose Thousand-eyes because of it's effect to take a monster which could really help clear the board of taking a high attack monster and I can use him as a fusion material for Starving Venom afterwards."

Here's a guide on how to manage without, as well as more general pointers on","<h1><span>Preface</span></h1> <span>Orcust is a deck I've </span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/orcust-soul-fusion/""><span>covered</span></a> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/orcust-savage-strike/""><span>before</span></a><span>, including a prospective look at using Savage Strike's new release of <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a>. However, a lot has changed since that article - I've learned new combos and techs, I've had time to refine the deck with real playtesting, and a new banlist has quite recently dropped that leads to a few small changes. In this article I'll be starting over, so this can stand on its own, and explain just how my brew of Orcust ticks. I'll also shamelessly be cribbing </span><a><span>MonoBlueTron's Ten Minute Testing</span></a><span> format, because honestly it's just a really good way to break down a deck. So that means I'll be giving some background on the archetype, outlining how my deck works, give a card-by-card breakdown justifying usage and ratios, show an example of how the deck plays, then finish with a summary of the deck's pros and cons and other options.</span> <h1><span>Introduction to Orcust</span></h1> <span>Orcust, as a theme, is an army of malevolent musical machines introduced in Soul Fusion, created by <a data-name=""Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu</a> after <a data-name=""World Legacy's Sorrow"">losing his sister</a></span><span> while he was <a data-name=""World Legacy's Nightmare"">busy fighting</a></span><span> sent him <a data-name=""Orcustrated Return"">mad with grief</a></span><span>. In gameplay, they're DARK Machine monsters that banish themselves from the graveyard to Special Summon others from the hand, Deck or graveyard - with their latest support complementing this by sending others from the Deck to the graveyard - at the cost of being locked to DARK monsters for the turn. Meanwhile, their Link monsters shuffle them back from banishment into the deck to power their effects while only needing a single Orcust as Link material. With a Field Spell that makes them all Quick Effects, they're a strategy with high potential for disruption, and if I had to pick one attribute to be locked into, DARK is quite possibly the best for maintaining access to powerful generic Extra Deck monsters. </span> <h1><span>The Deck's Goals</span></h1> <span>After some <a data-name=""Sheorcust Dingirsu"">fantastic</a></span><span> new <a data-name=""Orcustrated Climax"">support</a></span><span> in Dark Neostorm, the latest set in the OCG, the deck got some serious competitive attention, which is both a blessing and a curse. It's lead to a lot more optimisation and combo development than one dork going X-2 at locals can manage, but the star of these new combos is the highly-demanded <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a>, and since everyone knows about it already, finding and affording 3 copies of a card that Extra Link decks only ever needed 1 of is almost impossible for a casual budget player - the kind Orcust was most attractive to in the past. </span>  <span>However, there's a silver lining to this cloud, and I don't mean Iblee's Secret Rare foiling. All Iblee actually does for Orcust is grant access to <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a>, since Orcust Knightmare's name does indeed include that second word. There are plenty of affordable ways to make a Link 2 Knightmare monster, and they work as material for Mermaid just as well as they always have in other decks. They're not DARK, but that doesn't matter if we summon them before using any Orcust effect - which we do. Orcust has other tech options I'll discuss a bit later, but this particular build aims for a laser-like focus on consistently achieving this Knightmare starter, leading into the combo I'll lay out later. </span> <h1><span>Card-by-card Breakdown</span></h1> <h2><span>Core Engine</span></h2> <span>3 <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> </span><span>2 <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcust Brass Bombard"">Orcust Brass Bombard</a> </span><span>2 <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Wand""</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcustrated Einsatz"">Orcustrated Einsatz</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Orcustrated Return"">Orcustrated Return</a></span>  <span>2 <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator"">Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcustrion"">Orcustrion</a></span>  <span>Harp Horror and Knightmare are the deck's main playmakers, and effectively the same card since they can summon/send the other and converge from there. We want them at 3 because they can keep things going during the grind game, and if we start the game with one we can go straight into our combo and save a Link Knightmare for later. Cymbal Skeleton and World Wand are at 2 because having spares can be useful in the grind, and we don't </span><i><span>hate</span></i><span> drawing them, but we do still want another in our deck for the combo in that case. Brass Bombard on the other hand is only there for the aforementioned case of opening a 3-of, in which case it's sent straight from the deck to the grave - after that, the chance of having something in hand to summon is miniscule. </span>  <span>Babel, despite being the absolute lynchpin of the deck, is so definitely accessible and self-recurrable that we only need the one, since drawing multiples is dreadful and it makes space for combo starters. We do have another in the Side Deck for situations we expect that it might be banished, though. To contrast, the reason Einsatz is at 1 is because it's not crucial at all - it really helps keep up in the grind game, but being dependent on the opponent bars it from any potential use in combos. (Besides, if you're like me you'll always forget to activate it anyway). You can cut it if you want, really. Return being at 3 is admittedly something I could be talked out of - I did just complain that you don't have Orcusts in hand enough for Brass Bombard. However, being able to open it is pretty nice, and you can always just send from the field the Galatea that set it.</span>  <span>Galatea is a crucially important card, fetching Babel directly from the Deck - finally, a part of the combo not crucially vulnerable to Ash Blossom! - and helping get Orcust monsters into the graveyard for their effects. Longirsu is substantially less useful, but being able to remove a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> and other protected cards without having to go all in on Orcustrion's negation is too useful to miss, plus its 2500 ATK is helpful for a cute little surprise I'll explain later. Finally, Orcustrion's complete destruction immunity and potential for mass negation can apply a massive amount of pressure in the grind game and help close things out. </span> <h2><span>Phantom Knights</span></h2> <span>2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> </span><span>2 <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a></span><span> </span>  <span>1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a></span>  <span>While some Orcust builds aim for a full-on hybrid with Phantom Knights to help Link Summon, here I'm playing a rather small package as a part of the combo. The 2 Silent Boots are a similar situation to Cymbal Skeleton and World Wand, and everything but Shade Brigandine can be part of the main combo depending on the situation. As for Shade Brigandine, it overlaps with the next category, so let's take a look.</span> <h2><span>Iblee Replacements</span></h2> <span>3 <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Dark Grepher"">Dark Grepher</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Crystron Rosenix"">Crystron Rosenix</a></span>  <span>2 <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> </span>1 <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>  <span>All of these cards, bar Rosenix, are a 1-card Link 2, which will be Phoenix or Cerberus, to make Mermaid and start the combo. Phantom Skyblaster summons a <a data-name=""Skyblaster Token"">Token</a>, even if you only control itself. Scrap Recycler will send Crystron Rosenix to the graveyard for a <a data-name=""Crystron Token"">Token</a>, and Armageddon Knight or Grepher, searched by RotA, will send a Phantom Knight monster to search Shade Brigandine. Mathematician can send either option, and all of these mill cards can instead send an Orcust monster, either Bombard because you opened one of the 3-ofs, or whatever you need in the grind game.</span> <h2><span>Miscellaneous</span></h2> <span>1 <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></span>  <span>1 <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Summon Sorceress"">Summon Sorceress</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a></span>  <span>Foolish Burial and Monster Reborn are the most flexible slots by far. You can cut them for a cheap hand trap - <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> is getting that common print soon! - or as two of the spaces for Iblee if you can in fact afford it. Called by the Grave is pretty necessary, since just about everything we can do is stopped in its tracks immediately by the Forehead Zombie. </span>  <span>Topologic Bomber Dragon and Summon Sorceress are the remaining core components of the primary combo - lucky for us that Sorc survived the banlist for another format. Trisbaena is an alternate option against backrow decks, which seem like they'll comprise the majority of the upcoming meta, as well as - </span><i><span>sigh</span></i><span> - eking victory after time in the round. Be careful of banishing Babel, though. Wee Witch's Apprentice and Borreload Savage Dragon are your other flexible slots - Wee Witch can turn Skyblaster Tokens into an Effect Monster, and has one particular use I'll explain shortly, but otherwise doesn't have much going for her when you could summon Galatea, and Savage Dragon is a fearsome threat, especially when equipping a bigger Link, but difficult to summon in practice, requiring Bombard and either Knightmare or both a Level 3 and 4 - not the most efficient use of resources. </span> <h2><span>Side Deck</span></h2> <span>3 <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></span><span> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Orcustrated Core"">Orcustrated Core</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus</a> </span><span>3 <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> </span><span>1 <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a></span>  <span>Now, obviously a Side Deck is incredibly dependent on what you, personally, expect to face, and may as well not exist online, but this is what I have as of writing. My apologies to Punkrocklee, it has not been built with </span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/sidedecking-basics-3-rules-that-apply-to-every-format/""><span>this excellent article</span></a><span> in mind, and you should probably read that instead of just copying this, but I'll explain what I have nonetheless.</span>  <span>That's a lotta backrow hate, huh? In my experience at locals the Altergeist and Sky Striker matchups are significantly tougher than Thunder Dragon, which might be on the decline anyway - not that we're ignoring it with that D Barrier, which also takes care of the pesky locals Cyber Dragon player who loves to turn Orcustrion into a <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>. I honestly never faced DARK Warrior very much, but that was slaughtered by the banlist so hopefully we don't have to worry about it.</span>  <span>Pankratops is just a good, cheap card that should be useful against the variety of rogue strategies you might face without specifically preparing for. Cosmic Cyclone and Imperial Order are generic backrow hate - Order is probably not actually good, considering Babel is a card we use, but Sky Striker tears are just too tasty to ignore. Speaking of Babel, as mentioned before, that second copy helps out if we expect to get our Main Deck one banished - either by our opponent, or our own Trisbaena. Core is another Orcust card which… exists? It's not good enough to run but it's not bad enough for me to throw in the bin like <a data-name=""Orcustrated Attack"">Orcustrated Attack</a> or <a data-name=""Orcustrated Release"">Release</a>, so it's here as an honourable mention. It chain blocks <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a> like 3 times, that's fun. </span>  <span>Last but not least, Eradicator Epidemic Virus is a delicious little toy the latest banlist traded us for Grepher, and it's a trade I'm very happy to make. Longirsu (and Orcustrion in a pinch) is a valid Tribute for it that can be easily revived, but this is also where Wee Witch's Apprentice comes in handy - it pushes Rusty Bardiche over the threshold, allowing us to integrate it into our opening combo - which I think it's finally time for me to explain!</span> <h1><span>Playing the Deck</span></h1> <span>As a reminder, the following cards are our openers: Phantom Skyblaster, summoning a Token; Armageddon Knight, Dark Grepher and Reinforcement of the Army, sending either Phantom Knight to search and activate Shade Brigandine; and Mathematician or Scrap Recycler, sending Crystron Rosenix to summon a Token. You can also bypass the Knightmare step if you open Orcust Harp Horror or Orcust Knightmare along with any of said mill cards, just send Brass Bombard and summon it to make Galatea. </span>  <span>Once you have a Link 2 Knightmare, Link it away for Mermaid and summon Orcust Knightmare, use those two monsters to Link Summon Galatea, then use the latter Knightmare's effect to send Harp Horror to the graveyard. This is where the path converges with the Bombard opening. Use Harp Horror to summon Cymbal Skeleton and Link it with Galatea for Summon Sorceress, then revive Galatea with Cymbal and shuffle a card back for Orcustrated Babel - which card you shuffle depends on whether you're going first or second, though Knightmare is always an option. From there, Summon Sorceress can target Galatea for World Wand, and those two can be Linked away for The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche.</span>  <span>Here, things diverge on the dice roll. Going first, Galatea can't shuffle Harp Horror because you'll now use World Wand to summon it and Link Summon Topologic Bomber Dragon with Summon Sorc. Use Bardiche's effect to send a Silent Boots to set 1 Fog Blade, then search another with said Boots. This means you'll be sending Ancient Cloak to get Brigandine at the start, if you did. During your opponent's turn you can trigger Bomber at least twice, first with Harp for Cymbal, then that same Cymbal for Galatea, who can Chain to Bomber to grab Einsatz or Return from your Deck. If you're siding in Epidemic Virus, you'll summon Wee Witch's Apprentice instead of Bomber Dragon (in the most efficient use of Link Material since <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall</a> Pass), allowing you tribute Bardiche for the Virus in your opponent's Draw Phase.</span>  <span>Going second, you summon Cymbal with World Wand, send Ancient Cloak with Bardiche (and Silent Boots for Brigandine if necessary), and search the other Silent Boots, which you can summon and then overlay with the Cymbal for a Break Sword in a Bardiche points to, destroying 2 cards - 1 with each Phantom Knight. It's not quite the non-targeting send of <a data-name=""Sheorcust Dingirsu"">Sheorcust Dingirsu</a>, but it will do for now.</span>  <span>Later in the game, you can use your variety of mill cards to send Orcusts, either spare or shuffled back, to the graveyard and try to reach your leftover power cards like Longirsu, Orcustrion or Borrel Savage to close out the game. For example, you should already have a Galatea in grave from the first turn, so you can just Normal Summon any miller, send a Harp, summon Cymbal, and between linking away those two and reviving the Galatea you have a Link 4 worth of materials. The constant recursion and, if established, powerful disruption should help keep the pressure on your opponent in the grind game.</span> <h1><span>Final Thoughts</span></h1> <span>This deck has a lot going for it - it's fairly cheap, it has access to a fairly powerful opener and some devastating techs, and it's quite consistent which I'll analyse in a moment. However, it's incredibly vulnerable to disruption at the moment, losing to Ash Blossom, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, Called by the Grave, or any way to negate your Normal Summoned mill card. Also, at the end of the day it's still fundamentally the same Topologic Bomber Turbo strategy that I don't blame people for being a bit bored of - things don't really get more interesting until Dark Neostorm. We also don't really have the element of surprise we used to when people were sleeping on the deck, now that it's getting more attention. </span>  <span>As for that consistency analysis, </span><a><span>yugioh.party</span></a><span> is regrettably offline at the time of writing, so I've made do with </span><a><span>https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/hypergeometric.aspx</span></a><span> - shout-out to TreeTopDuelist for </span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/yu-gi-oh-hypergeometric-probability-distribution-function/""><span>this article on using it</span></a><span>. This build has 12 starters in a 40 card deck, and with a 5-card hand we have an 85% chance of opening 1 or more - and that's not taking into account the chance of drawing through your deck with Return, or alternate more janky options like Foolish Burial + any Normal Summon. If you can afford your Iblees, even just adding it to a now 43-card deck increases the odds to 89%, and if you cut 3 cards (I recommend Monster Reborn, Foolish Burial, and maybe Einsatz or 1 Return) it rises to almost 92%. </span>  <span>Now, this deck is both budget and focused on one particular gameplan to the exclusion of almost all else, but that doesn't mean it's all Orcust can do. If you can afford them, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrel</a> <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Link</a> monsters and <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> - conveniently DARK - fit right in, and of course it would be nice to find some room for hand traps. The Sky Striker engine is also another way to start the combo, making a Knightmare with <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Kagari</a> and a <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace Token"">Hornet Drones Token</a>. For alternative techs, World Wand, Brass Bombard and Orcust Knightmare are all valid targets for <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>, and with Knightmare especially you can make <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. You can also leverage the Level 4s and Phantom Knight access to make something like the new <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a> and Rank-Up into <a data-name=""Outer Entity Azathot"">Outer Entity Azathot</a> using <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>. There are other builds entirely that I don't have much experience with, such as going all-in on World Legacy cards like <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Crown</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">Succession</a> in order to mill with <a data-name=""World Legacy Survivor"">Survivor</a>, or sending <a data-name=""Destrudo, the Lost Dragon's Frission"">Destrudo</a> to make <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a>, summoning <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a>. You can also now play 3 <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> for a disgusting chance of opening more than 1 and just going straight to Orcustrion or even Longirsu to end the game immediately. </span>  <span>If it's not already obvious from the fact I've written like 2000 words about them for the </span><i><span>third</span></i><span> time, I really love Orcust. Their artwork and aesthetics, their gameplay as a deck, their role in the ongoing lore storyline, just everything about them inspires me to play them, and make them as good as I can, even if I can't have every card I'd like to play. Maybe this article will inspire you to play them, and take them to a level I can't afford to. Regardless, thanks for getting to the end of this wall of text, and enjoy any Orcust-related endeavours you undertake.</span>"

This deck can syncro very easy with a tefnuit-su- lv 4 dragon to bring your rank 10 Dracocytos out for example. Gebab and assault wyvern enable you to special summon dragon monster from hand/deck/or grave. Another thing is there is a defensive loop with keeper of shrine and any normal dragon when they die and you have a keeper in the hand or grave when the normal dragon dies keeper special summons itself and the normal monster hits grave and bounces back into your hand. Andrake is an interesting card when you tribute tefnuit for a su for example or just tribute to activate its effect special summon Andrake and instead of his attck going to 0 due to the hieratics effect instead it triggers andrakes effect and instead goes to 4k attck. You also have the option of using Chaos Levianeer by banishing dragons or Chaos Emperor Dragon Envoy of the End/ or (Chthonian Emperor Dragon which im playing right now in its place) or Red Eyes Darkness Metal. World Legacy Ark and Guardragon is for your links. The spells wingbeat/spell shattering arrow/ stamping (magic trap destroy) , Monster reborn/ return of dl/ monster rebone (grave res), Raigeki/drowning mirror/ Karma Cut/Guardragon Corrupt(monster removal note corruption can be used to remove monster/spell/trap), Summon limit/rivalry (slow pace down lock), Dragon's Lost Strain is a new and fun card put it on a trick star light stage and let the games begin turn the burn against them for example. hieratic seals self explain barrier and solidarity is for attack increase. Think of your links/syncro/xyz as a toolbox for example if you had the material Hieratic seal of celestial/Atum/ Guardragons when alligned/galaxy stealth combo extenders, Beelze/dragocytos indestruct while borrelguard cant be targeted by card effects, Topologic/BLS/Dark rebellion for their effect,Queen Dragun (dragon protection), triple burst (negation), tornado dragon (spell/trap removal). The side deck has a few alternatives."

Dragon and Phantom Knights' Silent books to the GY to summon slash dragon, then use silent boots effect to search fog blade, once you have done all of that, you can set all the traps in your hand. the reason why I play the phantom knights engine in this deck is so you can protect the red-eyes monsters on the field(mostly because red-eyes don't have any protection), and after tweaking with the deck a bit, I do believe that this is one of the better red-eyes decks to play(keep in mind that tomahawk is in the deck, and because of the new banlist, the best card to switch out for this is Mech phantom beast dracosac)."

Use this deck to burn your opponent at every turn.,"This is a go second deck, so you'll usually ""win"" the coin flip to see who goes first.  Your best option is to go second, if the draw goes well you'll have a full back row and one Timelord to summon.  Summon Michion or special Time Maiden to get Michion in order to normal him your first turn to halve your opponents Life Points.  Starting on your opponents second turn, let loose with the chain burn to inflict massive damage directly to them.  Fairy Wind, Torrential Tribute, and Drowning Mirror Force are a good way to keep your opponents field open and give you more time to set up if need be.  Kamion and Michion are a must, but they are at two because Kamion is easily searchable/summonable with Time Maiden, and you can't actually reduce your opponent's Life Points to zero with Michion.  Depending on the situation, there is a Timelord who has an answer for everything. Feel free to switch out other Timelords I didn't add to cater to your play style.  Cherries is a Side Deck card in case there is an Extra Deck monster that is giving you trouble, and that is why most of the Extra Deck and Side Deck are Link/Syncro/Fusion/XYZ monsters.  &nbsp;"

To doing fast and special summons, you'll need get the Dragon Ravine, with him, you can choose a best card to develop your game.

Benefits:  1 - Most monsters on this deck are of the LIGHT attribute, so the cards that support this attribute and help dragons too be very good;  2 - Making special summons with this deck is relatively easy, you need to discard a monster or send it to GY and use the effects of other monsters or spells / traps to be reborn.  3 - Powerfull and massive attack is granted;  Disadvantages:  1 - The most dangerous and critical disadvantages are lock your graveyard or special summons; 2 - Extra-deck. Yes, i created this deck using my real cards, so i don't create a recipe with cards i don't have.  To ending:  I hope you have enjoyed my recipe and feel free to build a similar or better. I'm open to suggestions.  e-mail: pokefan2007@hotmail.com  Thanks!!"
