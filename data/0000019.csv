The goal of this deck is simple, just get out ABC-Dragon Buster and banish your opponents cards and beat them down with this massive 3000 attack beater! Also I added Limiter Removal and Raigeki in the main deck to help get over boss monsters like Borreload Dragon, which this deck struggles severely to get over."

For additional counter plays the deck uses Artifacts to prevent the opponent (or yourself) from banishing cards, prevent extra deck summons or simply destroy cards from your opponent.Â  Depending on your opponents deck, there are an additional Moralltach and Lancea in the side deck. The Paleozoics are the main traps in this deck and you can use them for your XYZ plays with the frogs.  Additional stuff: Eater of Millions and Sky CavalryÂ  are used for some protection in case the artifacts brick or when you need to remove a threatening monster. The Handtraps in this deck are Effect Veiler and Artifact Lancea. Ash blossom was to expensive in my opinion so i use effect Veiler as alternative. There are Solemn Warning and Solemn Jufgement in this deck. I didn't include strike to keep the Call of the haunted in the deck But there will be no problems with swapping CotH for some strikes.  Side deck note: Some side deck cards can be swapped out. I have kept Paleozoic Dinomischus because i'm not sure if i should use only 1 copy of that card or 2. I rarely use him but when i use him, he can be helpful. Another card that isn't that important is the Call of the Haunted. I just didn't knew what to include at this point."

The goal of the Electrumite abuse is to stock the Extra Deck with Pendulum Monsters to bring out a variety of cards (whatever is suitable). With Clear Wing being a board wipe, Starving Venom being an extender (whether that be more negates with Odd-Eyes Vortex, or another card like Electrumite --&gt; which you might want to preserve the effect of for even more looping). The Mythical Beast engine is simply there to speed up the deck (and you include cards, like Rescue Hamster --&gt; which is a tech option in my opinion because it requires cards in the Extra Deck to be of use). If you'd like to see a board with 4+ Negates: Run 2 Starving Venoms, Firewall, Underclock, Norito, and an Odd-Eyes Absolute to pop into a Odd-Eyes Vortex (I don't run this setup but I've seen it, and it works). Other tech options include Psy-Frame, Gameciels (which slow down the deck), Ash or Ghosts (both slow down the deck), and standard side deck cards (for T1 meta like True Draco). This deck is a little more casual than your average Pendulum Mag. build, but it does have an incredible sense of speed --&gt; speed that, if played correctly, can match (if not surpass) many tournament standard decks."

Of course, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> is one easy step to clear your opponent's field, but it doesn't necessarily destroyed its spell/traps, which means you'll be opened to any traps/spells your opponent control. In this case, this deck fulfill its its requirements to sweep the field while also maintaining its safety. This deck contains all Strikeblade Archetypes and Spellbook Engine (<a data-name=""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"">Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</a>, <a data-name=""Spellbook of Secrets"">Spellbook of Secrets</a>, and <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledges"">Spellbook of Knowledges</a>) and Bamboo Sword Engine (<a data-name=""Broken Bamboo Sword"">Broken Bamboo Sword</a>, <a data-name=""Golden Bamboo Sword"">Golden Bamboo Sword</a>, and <a data-name=""Cursed Bamboo Sword"">Cursed Bamboo Sword</a>).

Jamming Waves can take care of any monsters that ""cannot be targeted by card effects"" since Jamming Waves doesn't specifically say ""target"". You can use Afterburner to take care of any powerful monsters like <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>Â (you have to lure it, or to negate it to destroy it).  <a data-name=""Strikeblade Ignition Engage"">Strikeblade Ignition Engage</a>Â is the very key to this strategy. If you use it, it is an endless loop of drawing one ~ eight from the deck, while also grabbing three cards from the deck itself, which is extremely consistent. IF you don't have any monster in your hand, or any to draw, go for <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Hornet Bit"">Strikeblade Battlegear Hornet Bit</a>, then one of the two: <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Widow Anchor"">Strikeblade Battlegear Widow Anchor</a>Â or <a data-name=""Strikeblade Battlegear Eagle Booster"">Strikeblade Battlegear Eagle Booster</a>.

You can add Call from the Grave to cancel your opponent's Ash Blossom for easy access. It also is a spell, so it is a great addition to your deck. The only unluckiness in this is when you can't afford to draw a card AND cannot summon a monster.

Great combos with <a data-name=""Magical Dimension"">Magical Dimension</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Renewal"">Dark Renewal</a> and Spellcasters, <a data-name=""Vengeful Bog Spirit"">Vengeful Bog Spirit</a>/<a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a> and Toon Monsters.  <a data-name=""Vengeful Bog Spirit"">Vengeful Bog Spirit</a> shares the Toon Monster handicap to the opponent. <a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a>Â is usable too, because tribute summoned monster (except for <a data-name=""Toon Magician Girl"">Toon Magician Girl</a>) couldn't attack immediately.  <a data-name=""Comic Hand"">Comic Hand</a>Â steal an opponent monster for free, and it could even attack in your very next turn.  <a data-name=""Magical Dimension"">Magical Dimension</a> is a great opponent's End Phase combo.  It has an enormous (ridiculous) staying power thanks to <a data-name=""Toon Kingdom"">Toon Kingdom</a>, also has great defenses like Mirror Forces, <a data-name=""Toon Briefcase"">Toon Briefcase</a>, Bottomless, <a data-name=""Black Illusion"">Black Illusion</a>, Compulsory, the Solemn. Even more defenses in the Side Deck, eventually.  Some cards like <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> are needed because of activation cost and maintenance of Toon Kingdom, as you can see I use 44 cards because of this.  You can use another Palladium or Red-Eyes instead of <a data-name=""Sorcerer of Dark Magic"">Sorcerer of Dark Magic</a>, it's here only for a ""Yugi Deck"" factor.  In side deck there are some combos too: <a data-name=""Toon Defense"">Toon Defense</a> with <a data-name=""Drowning Mirror Force"">Drowning Mirror Force</a>Â (you should use at least 2 of them for each one and remove all Toon above level 4).  <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>Â is a pain in the ass for the Pendulum/Link Decks and <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a>Â + Toon direct attacks are the death sentence for old decks."

Use it at your leisure. I'm not a fan of the cloud castle/calamities combo but I feel it might be better than twin burst which is why it's there.  Main combos, terraforming into mausoleum if you have 2 tuners in hand, bonus if one of them is Maiden, who summons a blue eyes from deck when targeted by mausoleums effect ,allowing you to go straight into needlefiber.  If you have destrudo, arkbrave or goliath in hand terraform ravine instead. Crystron needlefiber effect to summon o-lion from deck then link into summon sorc, either summon a dragon from hand if none are on field, not recommended but can be useful in certain situations like a matchup vs brandish.  You can easily get dark matter on field into arkbrave goliath combo. From there it's up to you, I don't like bringing out Saryuja unless I need the special summon, the deck for effect is just a bonus.  Enjoy."

This deck actually did really well in testing and has a pretty low brick rate considering they got hit hard on the last banlist. After days of testing and making this deck from scratch, this is what I came up with for Spyrals for the current 2018 meta format. The goal is to get out Spyral Double Helix using two Spyral monsters, Trigate Wizard, more link monsters, and Spyral Sleeper. Spyral Sleeper is the boss monster of the deck. Summon him by removing from play 3 Spyral cards in your grave. Then equip him with Spyral Gear - Last Resort and use Sleepers effect to target himself and two of your opponents cards for a nasty combo. This deck takes tons of practice so be sure to play it often if you wish to master all the combos and are new to the deck. Or, if you are already a Spyral pro from the previous format then you know the drill. Enjoy!"

This is the deck that will dominates for,"The deck strategy of this is mainly to OTK using Candina, Lycoris, and Kagari and lastly, Trickstar Bouquet. It's best if this goes second, and you do whatever Strikeblade Spells you need, and get out Kagari. Then you use Trickstars. There, you can get Candina, then get Trickstar Light Stage if you have Bouquet. Get Bouquet if you don't have one yet. Then you can deal huge battle damages using the combo of Bouquet AND Lycoris to boost your Kagari's huge attack. Last time I used this deck is that I deal 9000 LP damages at best. This deck doesn't really involves burns, but if you can burn it with Reincarnation and Lycoris Combo, that'll be great."

Summon out <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> to use its effect t0 destroy your opponent's spell &amp; trap cards up to the number of fusion materials used. My strategy is to summon out Rampage Dragon using Power Bond, thus doubling its attack points. Then I use its effect where you send up to two light machine monsters from your deck to the graveyard, and Rampage Dragon gains an additional attack for each monster sent to the graveyard. If you get the right hand you can easily OTK your opponent.  One other strategy is to have both Cyber Dragon and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> in your hand. You then special summon Cyber Dragon from your hand while your opponent only controls a monster. Then you normal summon Cyber Dragon Drei which its effect will change all Cyber Dragon monsters on your field to lvl 5 including itself. Then proceed to use those two monsters to XYZ Summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>, then special summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> over Nova. Infinity's effect allows you to turn your opponent's attack position monster into an overlay unit once per turn, which also increases Infinity's attack points by 200 for each overlay unit. You can also use Infinity's effect to turn one of your monsters into an overlay unit for Infinity which will boost its attack points.

This is actually really consistent due to the Deviritual cards, allowing you to easily get both a ritual monster and Advanced Ritual Art/Chaos form. You can also search the ritual monsters with melody of awakening dragon. If you get both rituals out and they have atleast 2 monsters (with 1 of them not being a link monster) you pretty much win since you can switch attack position monsters to defense and reduce their defense to 0, then attack with Chaos MAX and kill them with double piercing damage. Also, you can add any extra deck monsters you want."
