Main Deck  2 Alertitt. Most important recycler in the deck. With Shaddoll Ariel, Huaquero, and Invocation running around you don't want too get your Alertitt banished.  Queen. Personal preference either run 1 queen or 1 king or some list drop both entirely. I think Queen is the stronger of the two with her non targeting sending any card.  2 Nauya. You can drop the queen and run 3 Nauya if you so please. Personally I rather not open with a Nauya in hand she can somewhat start plays in certain hands, but rather see Nunu in hand.  Zoha. Idk why he dosent show on this list but this is 40 cards just dosent show zoha.  2 Water Lilly. You don't want to see this card in your opening hand. Always search for it with nauya secondary effect and always go for the full effect to special summon a reptile from graveyard.  Invocation. Again don't want to open Invocation ever. This list only runs 3 Invoked fusions so 1 is more than enough.  3 Judgments. This deck loses to dark ruler, droplets, and superpolys. ( Side Deck: 1 Imperial order and 2 Anti-spells specially for superpolys and pray they don't chain it.)  Extra Deck.  Invoked fusions. Personal preference you can run 2 Mechaba and 1 Calliga or 2 Mechaba and 1 Augueodies. I like having the options so I run 1 of each.  Sanaphond. Flex spot. People run dweller I find sanaphond easier to make and dosent interfere with the combos like dweller having to give up the rikka combo in order to go into a dweller opening play. Also has self protection and gets big really fast.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

In all of the decks I post I will use decks that have fallen under the radar even with their supreme powers. Welcome to...</span> <h1>Reviving Old Powers</h1> <h2>Deck 1 - World Chalice</h2> This deck is very smooth when you can use it right, and it is connected to very well known decks, such as Mekk Knights and Knightmares, and not-so well known decks, such as Krawlers, Crusadias, and Guardragons. I will go over strategies and maybe even a bit of lore. So lets dive in! <h3>Monsters</h3> <span>Lets start with the three most basic monsters in this deck: Beckoned, Chosen, and Crowned by the World Chalice. These are the easiest to summon and the ones with the most combos related to them. They also have the heaviest lore out of all of the monsters. You can use these monsters to Link Summon Imduk the World Chalice Dragon and make it where you can basically summon twice in one turn. Then you can use that to get Lib the World Key Blademaster. Having a 2000 ATK point monster that can put a Spell or Trap Card on the field every turn is pretty cool, especially since we have a lot of great spells and traps in this deck. Anyway, another helpful card in this deck is World Legacy - World Chalice. This card not only combines two archetypes, it also has an incredible effect. The effect activates when it is destroyed by battle, card effect, or even just a tribute. It makes you able to summon two World Chalice monsters from your Deck, expanding the possibilities of strategies. Lee the World Chalice Fairy helps you the most when you control Imduk, as it brings a World Chalice monster from the Deck to your Hand just by being Normal Summoned. World Legacy - World Key has multiple uses, as it can help Tribute Summon and destroy any opponent Link monster, as well as connect Lib to the World Legacies.</span> <h3>Spells and Traps</h3> <span>This is where it gets interesting. Call of the Grave is a very special card that not many people know about. If used, it can block the effect of Monster Reborn! That kind of effect can seal any chance of victory away from your opponent. Call of the Haunted is well known, however, since it works like a Monster Reborn with a bit of leverage for your opponent to grab on to. World Legacy Struggle can destroy a couple of spells, but make sure you have co-linked monsters. Bottomless Trap Hole is a card less used than some other cards, even though it can destroy the dreams of many duelists in one effect. It's effect destroys and card with 1500 or more ATK as soon as it is summoned. Then there is the Field Spell known as World Legacy Discovery. This card keeps World Chalice cards from death and raises their ATK and DEF by 300. Finally, the card that can change the duel. The World Legacy is a card that, when a monster with 5 or more Levels dies, it gains a counter. With 7 counters, you can destroy the card, making you able to Special Summon any Cyberse Link monster from the Extra Deck, so make your choice!.</span> <h3>Lore</h3> <span>I saved the best for last. According to some flavor text and some improvising on my behalf, the Mekk Knights have invaded a planet inhabited by the long forgotten World Legacies. These Mekk Knights, along with Krawlers and maybe even a couple of Crusaidas, destroy towns in their wake, and are on the brink of destroying this beautiful planet. Then, after years of obscurity, the World Chalice speaks to 5 brave characters who, since it does not say, have no actual names, so I will improvise. Ningursu is a human who lives in the forest, where a type of card mentioned only in his flavor text, The Mekkstrosities, destroy every last bit of the forest, killing anyone in sight. Aurum is a young boy who has been facinated by stories of his ancestors. He wants to be a hero someday, but no one belives he can do it. When he grows up, he destroys Mekkstrocities and wears their skin. Ib, otherwise known as Lib, is a magical human in search of piece and prosperity, but she is out of luck. She protects her family and friends from Mekk Knights as they ravage her city. These three heroes, along with a baby dragon named Imduk, get a quest from a messenger from the World Chalice. This messenger, named Fairy Lee, guides them on a quest to find all of the World Legacies and bring them together to save the world. On the way, they fight hoards of Krawlers, groups of Mekk Knights, and I imagine they see some Mekkstrocities. In this quest, Ib dies in a evil magic shown in the card World Legacy Trap Globe. And at some point, Imduk either parts ways with our heros or he dies in a battle shown in World Legacy Clash. In the end, they complete their quest and the Mekk Knights either flee or they are destroyed.</span> <h3>Final Notes</h3> <span>I hope you give me suggestions for new decks to review in the comments and if you have any information to tell me about lore or anything like that, please let me know. That is all from me! Thank you, and have a good week!</span>  &nbsp;"

PK have always been a hard deck for me to get use to. Now it's definitely  one of my favorite decks because of the play style and from the anime. It's a good going first deck but it can sometimes struggle with going second against already crazy boards. That's why I added accesscode talker and knightmare unicorn to pop any cards and potentially OTK. Another card that can help OTK is Raider's Knight and Arc Rebellion. Obviously the best starter is Tour Gide and then summoning Graff into Cherubini. From there you can go into many different boards depending on the hand. This deck has a lot of good options and I've had a lot of success with it.

Dragoon is someway getting hit on the ban list sooner or later. This is what I plan to use if/when Dragoon gets hit. ,"Taking out the Dragoon package opens up other plays for PK Fire. Everything is still pretty standard. But here's the changes;  I've added in Isolde for extended plays. Living Fossil is in incase I draw D.D.R. Living Fossil is also an extender like Monster Reborn. But in this case it's better because of it's utility with Isolde.  I still think Artifact Scythe is heavily underrated. Preventing your opponent from using their Extra Deck for a turn can give you the game. Using Dagda is the best way of getting it out. Use Bardiche or Abomination to destroy it. Or even Twisters if you've sided them in.  After getting Scythe to the board, you can link off Dagda with I:P for Abomination or Talker.  I still like Abomination for the deck. A potential three card destruction per turn can put your opponent in check. They're going to want to destroy Abomination ASAP.  I dropped PK Wings. The most you'll see Fog Blade is two. Sending one copy of Fog Blade to the GY isn't going to hurt. I also replaced Wings with Brigandine. Easily brought to your hand with Boots for extra extension if needed.  I think everything else speaks for itself.  &nbsp;"

Firstly you special summon Ascend Sage and then activate XYZ Change Tactics and summon your other level 4. XYZ Summon into Utopia Double and search Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force. To activate Double's effect you must first have full knowledge of your hand's abilities. What do I mean? Check if you can make Number 39 with the cards in your hand in order to use him for Dagner. In this case I suggest you use Utopia Double's effect to rank him up to your Leo Utopia Ray. In case you cant make Number 39 with your current hand use Double's effect to summon him and then rank him up into Dagner. Your ideal target for Dagner's effect is number 38.  In case you want to use the new field spell (ZEXAL field) I suggest you add 2 of them plus 1 Shining Draw.

La Bone Tower absorberá el alma y Deck de tu oponente! 7w7 The zombies have started the apocalypse! The Bone ,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Enviar al Cementerio todo el Deck oponente usando el efecto de Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower. OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/3Pj2jyF2wc4 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Para iniciar, debemos invocar a Cherubini, para lo cual tendremos muchísimos extenders. Luego de eso, dependiendo de cuántos tengamos, nos decantaremos por una de las 3 posibles rutas (explicadas en el video). <strong>Nota:</strong> La ruta de Tenyi (3 extenders) no fue incluida por ser algo trivial, ya que funciona igual que en otros videos.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Tour guide from the underworld:</strong> Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Phantom knights of torn scales:</strong> Vale x4. Envía al cementerio a Cloak para traer a Boots e invocarlo gratis. Luego, destierras este último para traer a Brigandine y al mismo tiempo invocar a Scales por su efecto.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk forward:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic wheeleder:</strong> Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li><strong>Psychic tracker:</strong> Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li><strong>Gilasaurus:</strong> Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil dig:</strong> Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a Torn scales, Junk forward o Kagemucha knight.</li>  	<li><strong>Emergency teleport:</strong> Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, tiene muy pocos bricks y/o garnets.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo. Con 2 extenders es suficiente, y tener más solamente lo hace mejor.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El Deck usa mill, por lo que puede ser vulnerable a Efectos Rápidos que se activan en Cementerio.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the Grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si robamos 3 garnets, será gg.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

The rest are cards which are helpful in the Archetype like Searchers, Kaijus, Floodgates and Trap Cards.  <strong>Yosenju</strong>  <strong>Kama 1:</strong> It is the best, thanks to its effect of returning to the hand opponent monsters.  <strong>Kama 2:</strong> Normally Kama 3 is required together to be useful, even so it is the one with the most ATK so a copy is not bad.  <strong>Kama 3:</strong> Look for Yosenju cards, although in a somewhat extravagant way, even so is a important monster.  <strong>Izna:</strong> The effects it has are both very useful, it can be discarded to give protection to your Yosenjus although you will usually summon it since it will be able to draw you an extra card which will be important.  <strong>Fire Formation Tenki:</strong> Look for any Yosenju.  <strong>Sword Sting:</strong> Good trap to search with Kama 3 for a next turn, even so it has requirements and other cards could be more useful.  <strong>Main-Deck</strong>  <strong>Kaijus:</strong> These have good synergy with the deck thanks to the fact that Yosenju cards specialize in returning cards to the hand, so they are a great complement.  <strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton:</strong> This is one of my favorite cards, it has very good synergy with the Deck since you can control the columns in a simple way, besides the most important things about Tiamaton is the surprise factor.  <strong>Prosperity</strong>: Being able to have a specific card is useful, also losing certain things from the Extra Deck does not matter so much to you.  <strong>Super Polymerization:</strong> Overall a brutal card.  <strong>Dogmatika Punishment: </strong>You don't care much about the Extra Deck, and the effect is pretty good.  <strong>Summon Limit: </strong>There are turns in which summoning several monsters is necessary, but among many things you can change your style of play to be able to strongly stop your opponent.  <strong>Macro Cosmos: </strong>Does GY matter?  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>Starving Venom: </strong>The best Super Polymerization target.  <strong>Diplexer Chimera: </strong>Target for Cyberse of Super Polymerization.  <strong>Elder Entity N'tss:</strong> Combo with Dogmatika Punishment.  <strong>Mudragon: </strong>Easy Target for Super Polymerization.  <strong>Lightning Chidori: </strong>Good Wind Xyz.  <strong>Abyss Dweller: </strong>One of the best Xyz in the game.  <strong>Knightmares: </strong>Generic Links.  <strong>Other Options: </strong>  <strong>Pendulum Swarm</strong>: Practically all Pendulum Yosenju cards, it is a completely different style of play.  <strong>Direct Attack:</strong> You have to believe me that I lost thanks to the fact that they simply hit me directly several times, if this happens to you often, maybe a Swift Scarecrow or a Battle Fader could be more helpful, although I see them more from Side Deck.  <strong>More Traps!!!:</strong> Use traps to your liking to control the game. Crackdow and Lost Wind are good for monster control, Lost 1 Turn if you want to take advantage of the Yosenjus (Remove Tiamaton), Solemn is always good and Roar has protection from attacks.  <strong>Thing you should Know</strong>  I would recommend the minimum of 5 Kaijus, but many times a greater amount of these are of great help since sometimes you lose them and cannot get them back.  Remember that your maximum number of cards is 6, do not discard cards stupidly, thanks to the Fact of returning cards to your hand.  Macro Cosmos prevents the use of Dogmatika Punishment, be alert.  Izna is an impressive card, it can save you from the interruptions during your Normal Summon and it can give you a good amount of resources through its effect.  <strong>Upcoming decks?</strong>  <strong>True Draco Crystal:</strong> It is already mandatory that I promise the recipe, so next month it will be as an extra.  <strong>@Ignister</strong><strong>: </strong>I'll just say it's not a conventional @Ignister recipe, I'll probably post it next month.  <strong>Ogdoabyss:</strong> Thanks to a friend the doors to the Reptile constructions have been opened to me, now I can assure you that one of these days an Ogdoabyss Deck will be published.  <strong>Remakes: </strong>Best Fusion Deck: Nothing has changed, Abyss Actor: Done, and with changes, Infernity Xyz: Possibly I can finish it soon and improve it, Albaz: I'm a little bored with this one.  If you would like to see one of this deck, dont forget to comment, it cheers me up."

It can topple top decks already so that’s a good sign.,"I made another Dogmatika Cyberdark deck! This is my third one so far so I guess I’m still improving them. This time around I made a suitable side deck for it as well!  The deck is pretty consistent and builds powerful boards with tons of negates and protection, also it uses floodgates to add more pain. With the Dogmatika engine it’s pretty standard combo for winda, the Cyberdark side is a wing it and hopefully end on Cyberdarkness equipped with dragon buster.  I got a side deck too! If you’re playing against a player who tends to need the needs in your side deck fusions you can swap out a fusion and put in fallen for titankad to summon and then you also have super poly in case it’s more of a dragoon turbo deck.  Let me know what you think of the deck in the comments!"

Also, I recently realized that Lyrilusc can use one of the most obscure cards in the game, it’s name is Ghost Fairy Elfobia. Elfobia can reveal a wind monster in your hand and then until the end of your opponent’s next main phase 1 neither player can use the effects of a monster with a higher level than the revealed monster, if Elfobia goes through most of your opponents handtraps (ash,meister, belle, game, and so on) won’t work, it’s like miscell! the reason I chose effect veiler is because it’s a level 1 handtrap so Elfobia won’t stop it. Elfobia doesn’t effect xyz and link monsters so your entire extra deck is safe from it.  I hope you guys like the build! I’m still fairly new to pure Lyrilusc so I am completely open to new suggestions!"

Add Winda....,"This is a Virtual World deck but with a side deck that lets you add a mini Shaddoll engine for going second.  Basic idea is to play Virtual World normally going first, but going second against a heavy extra deck based strategy (Invoked Shaddoll, Dragon Link, etc.), you can swap the Pot of Desires, Foolish Burial Goods, and Called by the Grave for Shadoll Fusion, Schism, Genius, and Dragon to make Apkallone (Apkallone negate + Genius negate + Dragon S/T removal) to help clear opponent's field effects or bait out negates and hand traps before playing through with Virtual World. In addition, with Apkallone up, Muddy Muddragon can be used to go into Winda and setting up Schism to bring out Apkallone during your opponents turn (another negate) and Shenshen can be used to recycle Genius and Dragon to keep making Apkallone (recycles herself) during almost every one of your opponent's turns.  Been working out so far in online testing, but still trying out different things to improve it as getting rid of Foolish Burial Goods going second does hurt consistency."
