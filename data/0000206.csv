And in return you get more tokens to possibly go into bigger plays. The monsters used in the extra deck can be changed depending on what you prefer but i think the dark fusions are mandatory for the strategy.

&nbsp;

I've made another Magistus deck before this and thought in just updating instead of sending another, but this new version with Brave Token engine is much different.

What this deck do is basically synchro summon in the start and in the late game otk with a big link combo.

The only reliable turner in the deck is Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame and even with only one turner the deck is consistent.

Magistus archtype is very flexible so you don't have only one combo to do and is always situational.

Spellbook engine is easy and give you a draw 2.

Brave Token engine uses many cards but is easy too, Just ~activate Rite of Aramesia ~then Journey of Destiny ~With journey take Wandering Gryphon Rider but if you are planning in Synchro summon with the token DON'T take Gryphon, take Aquamancer instead and stop here ~if you added a Gryphon then special summon him and activate Journey of Destiny to equip your token with his exclusive equip spell ~active the equip spell effect if you need, Gryphon is a omni negate by the way.

&nbsp;

Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

Any suggestions are welcome."

One is a draw 4 combo (with one interruption) and the other is a setting up floating interruption combo, they both start the same way.

Normal neo space connector

connector effect summon dolphin

Link those two for isolde

isolde searches immortal Phoenix

Mill durendal for renaud

renaud recycles durendal

activate durendal and then destroy it for renaud no 2

Renaud no 2 summons itself as a tuner

link both renauds for halq

use halq to summon Valkyrie

link Valkyrie for gullvieg

banish Gearfried, gullvieg, and Isolde as cost

here where it differs

for mass interruption floating boss combo you summon Valkyrie, gullinversi, and deverg, gullinversi can recycle if you want.

pass without making an aesier

on their turn halq can instantly summon formula synchron and draw you a card, then you can accel synchro into quadriongandrax for 3 banishes and if itâs removed then you can float it into gearfiend

If you want draw 4 then do this

Summon diverg, ivaldi, and mimir

ivaldi searches hildskjaf

pass

on their turn you halq into formula synchron

formula synchron draw one

Formula synchron tunes everything else for crocodragon for a draw 3"

I think this deck is really fun to play if you know how Eldlich, Invoked, and Shaddolls work, theres a-lot of things you could do with this deck in just the first turn and could easily have 1-2 fusion monsters out on the field along with Eldlich the golden lord.

OKAY since I explained fewer combos last time I'll explain all things now

To start you only need one of the Magistus monsters and one of their spells and it's better be not &lt; Aleister the Crowley &gt; cuz it's hard, to start with it. the first thing you need to do is to XYZ summon &lt; Rilliona, the wonderous Magistus witch wardrobe &gt; ( warning do not XYZ summon Ninaruru we never gonna summon that cardÂ  understand !! ) after you do special summonÂ  &lt; Zoroa, the Magistus of flame &gt; equipped with Ninaruru or whatever you wanted just be careful what type of monsters your opponent playing in the extra deck. and then we're going to synchro summon &lt; Zoroa, the Magistus of daimon &gt; then if had field spell &lt; secret village of spellcasters &gt; activate that, don't limit the field spell we need that much more then other cards but if your opponent were playing a spellcaster archetype just find a way to summon &lt; Aiwass, the Magistus spell spirit &gt; and take control of it when he summoned that.

you may ask what &lt; PSY-Framelord Omega &gt; doing here, well if you think he's only here to return your banished Magistus monsters you're wrong the first reason I added that card was to return back &lt; Magistus Vritra &gt;Magistus Vritra is the only way to protect your equipped Magistus monsters and cards when you don't have your field spell, you should not summon Omega first turn you need him in your second turn.

well let's look at the extra deck we 3 additional hand traps ( Nibiru - droll &amp; lock bird - artifact Lancea ) you only gonna replace them with ash blossom and ghost belle, also we have 2 other synchro monsters to replace with other synchros &lt; Adamancipator Risen - Dragite &gt; &amp; &lt; stardust Dragon &gt; but you can also use &lt; Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend &gt; and for the last be careful when using &lt; Magistus theurgy &gt; you can even use that on your opponent turn.

anyways yup don't forget this archetype hasn't finished yet, there are 4 or more supports cards left to come in the future due to their storyÂ  till next time see ya

This deck is very consistent, can play through multiple negates/disruption","Gain access to your boss monster, the ultimate apex predator: <em>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno,</em>Â using <em>Souleating Oviraptor</em>, or summon it through <em>Double Evolution Pill</em>, searchable with <em>Overtex Qoatlus</em> and <em>Animadorned Archosaur</em>, in order to crush your opponent with it's immense sheer force! This deck can also utilize <em>Shaddoll Fusion</em> to lay down extremely suppressive fusion monsters such as <em>El Shaddoll Winda</em>, <em>Construct</em>, and <em>Apkallone</em>, while also triggering the various GY effects of the <em>Shad</em><em>doll</em> monsters used as materials, as well as a few of the Dinosaur monsters, such as the aforementioned <em>Overtex Qoatlus</em>, or to send <em>Mis</em><em>cellaneousaurus</em> to the GY in a pinch to summon <em>Animadorned Archosaur</em>!

Two basic combos:

<strong>Combo 1</strong>: <em>Shaddoll Fusion --Â </em>While your opponent controls a monster that was special summoned from the extra deck, you can activate Shaddoll Fusion to send one of your four Shaddoll monsters to the GY, as well as Overtex Qoatlus, in order fusion summon El Shaddoll Winda, and to gain the effect of the Shaddoll monster used as material, as well as add a Double Evolution Pill from your deck to your hand. From there, since you can only special summon one more time this turn due to El Shaddoll Winda's effect, activate Double Evolution Pill to banish the materials used to summon El Shaddoll Winda to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno from your deck!

<strong>Combo 2</strong>:Â <em>Souleating Oviraptor and Babycerasaurus</em> -- Normal summon Souleating Oviraptor and use it's effect to add Miscellaneousaurus from your deck to your hand. From here, activate Miscellaneousaurus' effect in your hand to discard it. Now, not only are your Dinosaur monsters well protected from your opponent's card effects, you can banish Miscellaneousaurus to summon Animadorned Archosaur from your deck. Next, activate Animadorned Archosaur's effect to destroy the Babycerasaurus in your hand and add a Double Evolution Pill from your deck to your hand, and Since Babycerasaurus was destroyed by a card effect, you can activate it's effect, and summon a second copy of Babycerasaurus. Here's where things get tricky. Activate Souleating Oviraptor's effect to destroy the new Babycersaurus, and special summon one of the two copies of Babycerasaurus back from your GY. Since Babycerasaurus is not Once Per Turn, you can use it's effect again because it was destroyed by Souleating Oviraptor. Special summon Giant Rex from your deck. Next, link summon Linkuriboh using Animadorned Archosaur, then link summon Secure Gardna using Linkuriboh. After that, activate Double Evolution Pill to banish Linkuriboh and the remaining Babycerasaurus in your GY to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno from your deck. Finally, xyz summon one of your two Evolzar monsters using Souleating Oviraptor and Giant Rex. During your opponent's turn, Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can destroy Babycerasaurus and flip all of your opponent's monsters face down, and then since Babycerasaurus was destroyed by a card effect, you can special summon a new level 4 or lower Dinosaur monster! Try summoning another Souleating Oviraptor to add another Dinosaur monsterÂ  to your hand who will help you out next turn!"

PK mirrors are funny. anyways, despite the number of bricks in the deck (Dragoon package, BA package, and toketomborg) the deck is rather consistent because of the bamboo engine. Basically he just wanted a free draw 2 without the downside of Allure of Darkness so he doesn't have to run as many DARK monsters to get it off consistently. Of course the usual dragoon package allows PK to still have a solid board present through some disruption, and the lack of tour guide is because ""you do not want your normal summon negated, especially in a deck like PK where negating the effect just stops your turn right there."" But then you might be asking the question ""well then why not run Kagemucha knight? It can chain-block against ash"" well that's because 1: Tour Guide can still be veilered/impermed and 2: ""kagemucha knight is a nice extender, but since it only works on normal summon, it can brick so i didn't run it.""

Control the flow of the game !!!,"This is an better and updated list to the v1 list that I released earlier this month I have had some time to really understand the deck's strengths and weaknesses, I have make some significant changes to the deck to make to run more consistently and address the previous issue of going first and not being able to counter your opponent effectively.

Cards cut Ash Blossom, Invoked Purgatrio, Dragon Shrine, Dragon Revival Rhapsody, and Twin Twisters (moved to side deck)

Card ratio's change Blue-Eyes, Aleister, Effect Veiler, White Stone of Ancients, Invocation, and Silver's Cry.

So my thought process to get this build was one of two things, cut cards/change ratio's stopping the deck from being consistent and having less brink hands. For example I changed the ratio's for the Invoked engine so that one it don't brink but you also still get good value out of it, support cards like newly added ""Terraforming"" and ""Foolish Burial"" allow allow for the deck to have easy access to Aleister and Meltdown. Now you might be thinking why would you wanna foolish an Aleister well if you open or draw into Invocation you can foolish Aleister to grave and then Invocation is fully live as you would banish Aleister from grave and it becomes a plus 3 as Aleister would be added to hand you'd have a Invoked Fusion monster on board and Invocation back to deck via effect. In terms of the Blue-eyes engine I changed the ratio's for both Ancients and Blue-eyes with Ancients the grave effect is the most important so that if you need to discard a Blue-eyes or Alternative you can add them back, with Blue-eyes I changed the ratio to 3 previously I said not to play Blue-eyes at 3 unless you decided to play ""Mausoleum of White"".Â  The thought process here was 1 Blue-eyes is a hand lock one is a grave lock and the third is open to be used in the way you need it to be, you need one in hand mainly for Alternative plays can be used for Trade-In plays and added back with Ancients or Seyfert. With the extra deck I substituted ""Invoked Purgatrio"" for ""Number 68: Sanaphond The Sky Prison"" for 2 reasons one because Purgatrio is harder to use as Ash was cut from this build so it would rely on opponents using Ash or them playing Fire type monsters which is not realistic or consistent and two Sky Prison is more consistent as it's a rank 8 that makes opponents have to overextend if there deck is grave special summon reliant.

Master and Sage are your MVP tuners, Master can also be used to get a rank 8 play off with ""Linkuriboh"" which is a mini combo in this build which would summon Master get normal summon effect if not negated you can add ideally a Sage of Veiler back to hand then link it off for Linkuriboh use Master effect in grave target Linkuriboh and special summon a Blue-Eyes monster. In terms for going for Synchro plays it all based on the duel situation if you to play more aggressive use Crocodragon and if you need to play more defensive play Spirit Dragon package, Cloudcastle can be used from defensive or aggressive but ideally only use it if you have another level 9 monster in grave so you can go into Enterblathnir which yes it gets over Dragoon.

If you have any questions or recommendations please feel free to leave a comment and I'll get back to as soon as I can."

The only interaction <strong>Eldlich</strong> has with Vampires is that your<strong> Eldlixirs</strong> can summon <strong>Vampires</strong> and <strong>Vampire's Domain</strong> is a continuous spell that <strong>Golden Lord</strong> can make use of. You go first with this Deck.</span>

<span>3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 2 <strong>Golden Lord</strong>, 1 <strong>Vampire Baron</strong> which helps with stealing monsters, 3<strong> Scarlet Scourge</strong> which also helps with stealing and reviving <strong>Vampires</strong>, 3 <strong>Retainer</strong> which searches spells/traps, and 3 <strong>Familiar</strong> which searches monsters. 3 <strong>Vampire Ghost Ogre</strong>. It ROTAs for a <strong>Vampire</strong> and either sends <strong>Retainer</strong> or <strong>Familiar</strong> to grave and it is also a quick eff Normal Summon. You want to use <strong>Familiar</strong> to search <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> for a follow-up next turn and you would want to search either <strong>Vampire's Domain</strong> or <strong>Vampire Domination</strong> with <strong>Retainer</strong> for more plays this turn or disruption.</span>

<span>Spells/Traps: 2 <strong>Eldlixir of Black Awakening</strong> which summons a Zombie from deck which is most important. 1 <strong>Eldlixir of White Destiny</strong>. 3 <strong>Eldland</strong>. 3 <strong>Vampire's Domain</strong> which is still a great additional normal summon enabler and a way to get back those LP you just burn through. 1 <strong>Vampire's Desire</strong>. <strong>Vampire Ghost Ogre</strong> is your main source of a <strong>Foolish</strong> and<strong> Scourge</strong> is a lest costly revive so you don't quite need it. 3 <strong>Prosp</strong>. 3 <strong>Scarlet Sanguine</strong> which summons a Zombie from Deck or Grave most importantly. 3 <strong>Conq</strong>. 2<strong> Huaq</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire's Domination</strong> which is a searchable omni-negate. You could bump <strong>Huaq</strong> to 3 if you cut <strong>Vampire's Desire</strong> also.</span>

<span>Extra: 1 <strong>Zeus</strong>. 1 <strong>Gaia Charger</strong>. 1 <strong>Dragulas</strong> for style points tbh. 2 <strong>The Undead Vampire</strong> which is just untargetable <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> that can yoink a monster that you milled from either player's Deck. This isn't Control Zombies so you are going to have to make it using 2 stolen monsters which isn't that hard with <strong>Scourge</strong>,<strong> Baron</strong>, <strong>Sheridan</strong>, and <strong>Crackdown</strong>. 2 <strong>Vampire Sheridan</strong> which can send a card to Grave and it can also steal a monster that was sent to the Grave by card effect. 1 <strong>Vampire Knight Bram</strong> which also steals monsters and you can make it using <strong>Golden Land Traps</strong>. It recurs itself so its okay at 1. 1 <strong>Accesscode</strong>. 1 <strong>BLS Link</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire Fascinator</strong> which is honestly here to link off monsters. It isn't that great here as compared to in Control Zombies. 3 <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong>.</span>

<span>Side Deck: 1 <strong>Vampire Voivode</strong> which is definitely playable but isnt that great except for very niche situations. 3 <strong>Nib</strong>. 3<strong> Kaijus</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire Fraulein</strong> which is good but since we are playing actual <strong>Vampire</strong> cards, it isn't as versatile due to you constantly burning LP. 3 <strong>Twin Twister</strong>. 1 more <strong>Vampire Domination</strong> and 3 <strong>Crackdown</strong>.</span>"

Most optimal route is opening either of the new Stardust monsters and <a data-name=""Stardust Illumination"">Stardust Illumination</a>.Â  Activate Illumination to Foolish Burial the other Stardust; <a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail</a> if you drew <a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">Stardust Synchron</a> and vice versa, normal summon a monster and activate the Stardust Synchron tributing the monster to special summon Synchron.Â  Search off the Synchron summon for <a data-name=""Arrive in Light"">Arrive in Light</a> and activate Trail to special summon.Â  Activate Arrive in Light to stack <a data-name=""Converging Wills Dragon"">Converging Wills Dragon</a> then synchro summon Stardust.Â  Chain 1 Arrive in Light chain 2 Stardust Trail.Â  Stardust Trail will summon a level 1 token then draw the Converging Wills with Arrive, activate the Wills and summon it off the draw.Â  Activate Illumination in grave to increase Stardust Dragon to level 9 then synchro for 11 and you have your <a data-name=""Shooting Majestic Star Dragon"">Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</a>.

There's so many ways to toolbox your way around you're just going to have to test the deck to find.Â  Way too many to type out here.Â  Give it a shot, pretty fun deck and can get exceptionally mean if it goes full combo.Â  Oh yea, can also play through a negate sometimes depending on your draw but not always, good thing to point out."

So of course ideally you want to go first setting up the 3 magnet warriors and sometimes Naturia Beast or Hyper Psychic rider for small disruption using Adamancipator Researcher. I didn't include more Adamancipators because I wanted this to be just Magnet Warriors with Adamancipators and not the other way around. The deck can make Imperion Magnum the Super Conducting Battlebot with Proxy F Magician though I quite rarely make it. Usually it is there to finish off opponent with its powerful omni negate effect when opponent is low on cards, usually after my OTK fails.

1. If you have luck and you choose if you want to go second or first always pick second, because you can get a Cyber Dragon from your Drawn Phase and special summon it and you can still normal summon in this turn.

2. Play for ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" from which you can go for ""Cyber Dragon Infininy"". But you can still go for ""Cyber End Dragon"" and ""Cyber Twin Dragon"".

3. When you get ""Future Fusion"" and play it go for ""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"" or ""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"" and for the materials always remove <span class=""VIiyi"" lang=""en""><span class=""JLqJ4b ChMk0b"" data-language-for-alternatives=""en"" data-language-to-translate-into=""bg"" data-phrase-index=""0"">at least</span></span> one ""Cyber Dragon"" and one ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and for the rest of the materials remove ""Machina Fortress"", ""Cyber Eltanin"", Armored Cybern"", ""Cyber Valley"". At this point your ""Chimeratech"" monster will be like 6000 ATK and DEFF, but If you want you can remove even more depends on the situation you are in.

4. Don't forget about your spells and traps, because most of this cards can bring you back monsters from your GY.

5. Last, but not at least have fun <span class=""VIiyi"" lang=""en""><span class=""JLqJ4b ChMk0b"" data-language-for-alternatives=""en"" data-language-to-translate-into=""bg"" data-phrase-index=""0"">while</span></span> playing with your friends, family, or even on a tournament."

The goal of the deck is to summon Arcana Knight Joker, Arcana Extra Joker, or Arcana Triumph Joker depending on your need.

Cards like Mirror Force, Swords of revealing light, or Kunai with Chain are used to temporise the game to let the user get the cards he wants.

The original monsters are pretty weak and their effects are useless so Noble Arms Destiny and White Veil are used to give immunity to destruction or effect and cant get combine with

Silent Swordsman also used as support and can become an ace if other strategies fell

E-Tele has a new target to summon as well (no, we're not using the old and slow <a data-name=""Krebons"">Krebons); </a><a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> is a wonderful hand trap that can be used with E-Tele!</p>
<a data-name=""Starleige Seyfert"">Starleige Seyfert</a> is an excellent card that we can use to tutor our <a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon by discarding a level 7 Dragon such as </a><a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon"">Absorouter Dragon</a><a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a><a data-name=""Absorouter Dragon""> (if </a><a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson ever comes back, this deck will LOVE IT!).</a>

Since the deck runs lots of Light and Dark support, running <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space is a no brainer and helps make the Chaos portion of the deck function. By adding chaos to the mix, we have a bit better GY control for our DAD.</a>

Everything else just helps the deck function. The extra deck is quite robust, having ways to Fusion, Synchro, XYZ and Link Summon. Remember, this deck is a rogue strategy, but a fun one. If anyone has any suggests to help the deck gain more consistency, please message me with some suggestions!"

","<h4>Â  Â Win without normal summon.</h4>
&nbsp;

This is an OTK deck where you have only one combo.

I chose infernoids becouse they are the only (not sure) monsters easy to special summon and that cannot be special summoned by other ways so perfect target to monster Gate/Reasoning.

To make the main combo you will need <strong>the right</strong> <strong>cards in hand </strong>and <strong>good RNG </strong>to extract it's maximum potential.

<strong>Â  The right</strong>Â <strong>cards in hand</strong> are Guardian Dreadscythe (the boss monster), 2 low level infernoid monsters and a monster gate. There's a secondary version with just Guardian Dreadscythe and Reasoning.

<strong>Â  Good RNG, </strong>it's basically don't end the game sending the 2 Dreadscythe's equip spell to the graveyard while gotting the maximum of monsters in the grave.

Monster gate and reasoning interactions with this deck are really interesting because instead of using them to summon a random monster we use to send tons of monsters to the graveyard and summon only one. Also... I need some sleep, ill finish this guide later zzzz.

&nbsp;

!1!update; I'm back :)

If you already have <strong>the right cards in hand</strong>; this is the combo with monster gate (With Reasoning just trigger and jump to the third step):
<ol>
 	<li>Summon a low level infernoid or a Photon Thrasher.</li>
 	<li>Use monster gate on the it and see the magic happening.</li>
 	<li><strong>Good</strong> <strong>RNG</strong>, if you are luck you may get a tons of monster in the grave.</li>
 	<li>Monster gate/Reasoning special summon Eatos.</li>
 	<li>If Infernoid Onuncu was send to the grave or is in your hand, special summon and active it effect, destroying Eatos and any enemy monsters with no protection on the field.</li>
 	<li>After Eatos has been destroyed you can active Guardian Dreadscythe in your hand, special summoning him and in sequence equipping Reaper Scythe - Dreadscythe.</li>
 	<li>At this point you have a spell/trap negate and a BEG beatstick so just destroy your enemy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
Â  The whole deck is made for this combo and will break if you got 2 Eatos in hand or send 2 Reaper Scythe to the graveyard.

Is easily disrupted by any trap deck or decks using ash blossom so i recommend you to use against friends and other casual decks. At least until 2031.

Pot of prosperity is bad since you may not win in one turn but helps alot to get a perfect hand.

Hidden Armory can save you from losing by having no Reaper Scythe in deck and can search Power of Guardians to protect your boss monster.

Infinite Impermanence is the only hand trap i could think that can't be special summoned, psy-framegear gama could've been a very good hand trap for this deck but unfortunately you would need at least one psy-frame driver and that would add one more layer of RNG to the combo.

!2!Update: Added Photon Thrasher.

&nbsp;

Sorry fo any grammar mistakes.

Any suggestions are welcome."

You always wanna go in seccond with this deck.

After trying to get the link summoning methods in my head I asked some people in reddit and they told about the crusadia archetype. They even made a deck with this tool in order to me to get the basics of link summoning and I felt in love with it. After watching some videos about the lore of the cards I believed they were inspired in Final Fantasy lore, specifically 7. God even some characters have are very close to the game ( yes I'm talking about those lions and little mages) and a tryceratops tank (in this case the Tryceratops is Thicc). Oh and the Kaijus are basically the weapons.

Now the strategies

Otk deck = You want to go second

Basically you want to see kaijus and crusadia power/arboria in your hand with anything else from the deck other than the trap and the codebreaker. The kaiju allows you to have a clear way from annoying cards (dragon, any despia, plasma or any other hero that is a pain in the ass) to deliver a one punch since maximus doubles equimax/avramax damage, being easily over 8000 and easily oneshoting in turn two. We have four here cuz this is my deck and I made it budget friendly but you could go for 6 even. They are always good to get your hands on and can save you games.

Crusadia power basically makes a magius unegatable and unaffected (not by counter traps if you try to chain it) but also makes your monsters nibiru proof. Yea who would thoght about that. And the token? don't worry about it, that is the whole reason of the Link Spider.

If your opponent already knows the deal and doesn't summon anything (only way to screw over your otk) or makes you play first you can always go for the Codebreaker (You need to have at least 3 monsters that can special summon themselves from your hand and at least 2 different crusadias) to get a two negate apollousa and a one negate equimax that can get you one of the two world legacy cards in the deck (Krawler basically) to make your opponent regret making you go first. Only weakness about this is our Rocky ''Friend''.

&nbsp;

Fire desires if you already have codebreaker or doesn't even need him, or bait the opponent if they have a lot of negates on the field in other to kaiju the other. Twin twister with Arboria, since she is a very good protection, or anything else, any flood gate or anything else will kill your will to play the game, so it is better to be safe than sorry. Always good to have our super dino friend that tributes himself in order to pop one of your opponents card. Jigabytes and Ranryus combos with magius but you could trade them for Parallel Exceed and a Mudskipper.

Crusadia basics :

Magius= Searcher

Draco= Extender

Arboria= Protection

Power= Bless

Avramax= To take the trash out

Spatha= Good to make your opponent regret their normal summon

Regulex= Spell searcher

Equimax= Literally one punch horse

Oh and if you are against a control or stun deck, <strong>pray, alot actually.</strong>

And remember, it is <strong>my</strong> deck with <strong>my</strong> budget. You can always improve and upgrade it to new other levels. Hope you enjoyed ^^"

So some key cards:

Vampire ghost ogre: serves as an better version of uni-zombie in vampires(dumps vampire from hand to search an level 4 or higher vampire, and then be able to dump retainer/familiar from deck/banish to provide additional normal summon)

Retainer/familiar: easily searchable/summonable s/t and monster searchers

Uni-Zombie: no explanation needed

Vampire scarlet scourge: when summoned, can bring back any vampire from grave for 1000 lp/summon any monster destroyed by it via battle

Vampire Fraueline: zomibie honest(not opt.)

Vampire Voivode: the main deck boss(genesis sucks too much lol), when brought out on turn 2+ via normal summon, can summon 2 monsters from opponents grave(which can be used for links, sheridan and undead vampire), can special summon itself from gy when a monster is summoned from opponents gy(too easy for vampires tbh), and partial monster effect negation.

(Grace, Duke, and Red Baron are good as one offs imo)

S/T lineup:

Vampire's Desire: Foolish Burial/level changer, as well as an monster reborn in 1 card. 3 c0pies at all times

Vampire's domain: additional normal summons/lifepoint recovery when dealing battle damage(imo 1 is fine due to searchability, but 2 copies can be good too)

Vampire Domination: Archetypal omni negate+lifepoint recovery(3 copies are good, but feel free to run 1-2, as its easily searchable)

Vampire takeover: archetypal metavers/call of the haunted(when field zone is empty): good 1st turn option, bit gets weaker in other turns(run 1-2 copies)

Vampire Empire: Zombies gain 500 atk during damage calculation+ when a card is milled from opponents deck, dump 1 vampire from hand/deck to grave, then destroy 1 card on field(non-tageting). (Decent, but as its easily searchable feel free to run 1-2)

Tech cards:

Foolish Burial: Zombies LOVE the graveyard, so...always use this

Monster reborn: No need for explanation.

Book of life: good 2nd turn card(remove from play 1 monster in opponents grave to summon 1 zombie from your gy)

Called by the grave: no need for explanations here.

Additional tech cards:

Jack-O-Bolan: Can special summon itself from hand by dumping 1 zombie from hand, can banish itself to ss a zobie in either gy(use th ezombie world varian if you want to use this properly

Zombie World: No need for explanation.

Necroworld Banshee: Can search afforementioned field spell(whther on the field or when its in the gy)

Mezuki: again, no need for explanation(banish itself to ss a zombie in your gy)

Gozuki: no need for explation here as well(foolidh burial, and when sent to gy: banish 1 other zomie in the gy to ss a zombie fron hand)

glow-up bloom: when sent to the grave, can banish itself to add an level 5 or higher zombie to your hand, or if ""zombie world"" is on the field: special summon it(good searcher, but even better with zombie world)

Doomking balderoch: seriously, no need for explantion(good target for glow up blooms special summon effect, can ss itself from the grave when ANY field spell is up during either players standby phase, can once per chain negate an zombie monsters effect, or banish an zombie from either the field or in the opponents gy)(use with zombie world).

Zombie Necronize/Power Struggle is good also.

No extra deck.,"A combination of True Draco and Eldlich with only the necessary cards.

Pot of Desires and Card of Demise are powerful draw cards, but they have potential downsides so try to use them after seeing your engine pieces.
Dragonic Diagram is a great card that can help set up your GY for Eldlich and search your True Draco cards.
Monarchs Erupt and Skill Drain can help control the board after you've set up.

Budget options:
Cursed Eldland($20 per) â Terraforming+Mystic Mine($9): Provides consistency and forces negate.
Evenly Matched($13 per) â Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju($2 per): Helps go 2nd and break boards.

Other cards to consider:
Artifact Lancea: Cosmic Cyclone and Evenly Matched hurt the deck a lot.
Twin Twisters: faster s/t removal for backrow decks.
Domain of the True Monarchs: to lock your opponent out of the extra deck.
Called by the Grave / Amano-Iwato / Solemn Strike are all cards to consider."

This decklist can also be tooled to be very budget friendly by replacing high-cost cards with low-cost alternatives (extra deck and side deck specifically). Primary weaknesses of the deck are decks that utilize face-up spell/traps (continuous or pendulum), monster effect immune decks, and imperial order."

<span>Strategy:</span>

<span>The goal of the deck is very straightforward, and it involves setting up a board of Myutant Beast and/or Myutant Arsenal with at least 1 floodgate and 1 Myutant Cry set. Starters include the 3x Myutant M-05, 3x Myutant ST-46, and 1x E-tele. You then use either Myutant monster starter to search out a spell/trap (usually Myutant Cry) or a monster to go into Myutant Beast or Arsenal, with Beast being the greater priority target. Pot of Prosperity helps quite a lot with searching out the starters/floodgate traps, and Nadir Servant can be used to send extra deck monsters to destroy cards or gain much more resources to restore card advantage. Severable notable combos below:</span>

<span>1. Starting with Myutant Evolution Lab and a Myutant M-05, you can summon M-05, get out ST-46, pitch both to summon Myutant Beast, summon ST-46 from banished with Evolution Lab, and then search out Myutant Cry, with the option to go into Myutant Arsenal or to continue with other plays.</span>

<span>2. Another combo is with Nadir Servant and Myutant ST-46/Myutant Cry in hand. You can use Nadir Servant, send a Myutant Ultimus, search out Dogmatika Maximus, use Maximus to banish the Myutant Ultimus and send Myutant Synthesis + another fusion (usually Titaniklad). By searching out Myutant Cry and/or having it in hand already, you have essentially set up the materials in grave/banished for the fusion summon of Myutant Synthesis for the next turn.</span>

<span>Notable Exclusions:</span>

<span><span>Myutant Expansion</span></span><span> - While very good for the Myutant archetype overall, cards like summon limit and TCBOO are much more preferred over having this card, which is much slower and does not impact your opponent's gameplan as much as the floodgate traps.</span>

<span><span>Psy-framegear Gamma + Driver</span></span><span> - In theory, the psy-framegear package is ideal because it helps prevent your myutant beast/arsenal summon from being ashed. In practice, however, this card is usually a brick even when you are going first. Effect veiler/impermenance screw you much harder anyways, and this deck has ways to continue plays past a negate on your Myutant starters with cards like Nadir Servant and Myutant Evolution Lab.</span>

<span><span>Myutant GB-88 &amp; Myutant Mist</span> - Both of these cards are bad even within their own archetype. Myutant GB-88 is too conditional and is a really bad normal summon, while Myutant Mist is unable to disrupt your opponent's plays (unlike Beast &amp; Arsenal) and therefore is not impactful enough on the board.</span>

<span>Notable Inclusions:</span>

<span><span>Shiranui Swordsaga</span> - Because Dimension Shifter forces you to banish cards instead of sending them, it may seems that the Dogmatika engine does not synergize well enough with the hand trap. However, with Shiranui Swordsaga, you can banish it from your extra deck to summon a token, which can be used as fodder to activate both Myutant Beast and Arsenal's quick effects.</span>

<span><span>Dimension Shifter</span></span><span> - The best hand trap for this deck. Banishing cards is not a big deal since Myutant Cry and Evolution Lab can make use of banished monsters and the Myutant lvl 8's can recycle banished Myutant spell/traps to the hand. Unlike Ash blossom, which your opponent may be able to play through, an activated Dimension shifter can ruin your opponent's entire turn due to most current decks relying heavily on the graveyard (Tri-brigade, Drytron, Prank-kids, etc.).</span>

If you open Journey, activate it, search Aquamancer, and pitch it. Feel free to banish Journey for your Gullveig activation (chain blocking it of course) as you can simply bring out the second copy next turn w/ the Rite you'll get off of the Aquamancer in GY.

Aquamancer and Foolish raise consistency so that you're basically playing 7 copies of Rite.

When opening Doll Fusion against an opponent w/ an ED monster, the line ive settled on atm is:
<ul>
 	<li>Activate Fusion, send Winda and Lord, summon Construct into the EMZ</li>
 	<li>Construct and Winda's effects, summon Ariel face-down and mill Resh</li>
 	<li>Make G-Controller, adding back Fusion</li>
 	<li>Lord eff, pitch Fusion, revive Lord</li>
 	<li>Resh eff, banish Construct, flip Ariel</li>
 	<li>Ariel eff, summon Construct</li>
</ul>
Now you could send say, Shaddoll Dragon for a s/t pop, or falco for an extra Gullveig mat. As said, I need to rethink the applications of this package.

That should be everything that needs explanation. I realize I havent updated my Tri-Bri list, I intend on reworking eventually."

Just got into the game for about half a year and I've gotten myself an Invoked Shaddolls deck so I want to share it with you guys. (Also my English is not my 1st language so sorry in advance if I butchered it :D )

Because this is my IRL deck and my budget is pretty low so there wouldn't be a Dogmatika package though It would be slightly better when mixed in.

The main strategy here is to go first and build a board consists of at least 2 interruptions (preferably a negate and Winda) to lock your opponents from playing the game. There is also a pretty neat combo in this deck that would lay out a Mechaba, a Dragoon and a set Schism and I'll tell you guys about that later. First I'll go over a few important notes about the rullings of these cards so that you won't misplay and you won't get cheated on like I did :')
<ol>
 	<li>Â  Â  Â All of the effects of the main deck Shaddoll monsters is a hard once per turn and only once that turn. So no flipping the card face-up to gain it's effect and activate it's other effect when sent to the GY in the same turn. This is also the same for the trap card Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</li>
 	<li>Â  Â  Â Shaddoll Schism can only be activated during the main phase. It may sound ridiculous to mention this because it's literally the first line of the card text but when I was in my local shop a surprisingly amount of players activate the card in the Battle Phase as an extra attack but that's not a legal play. Also you must remember that the monsters that are summoned using Schism can not attack directly (you should put a counter on it to remember).</li>
 	<li>Â  Â  Â You can get Ash'ed when using Shaddoll Fusion even though there aren't any extra deck monters on your opponent's field (Even with Meltdown's protection).</li>
 	<li>Â  Â  Â Your opponent can not Ash'ed your Anaconda effect.</li>
 	<li>Â  Â  Â If you used Red-eyes Fusion from your hand and the opponent negated it with an Ash, you could not Gamma it.</li>
</ol>
Ok now for the combo of this deck. What you need in your hand is a Magical Meltdown, a Squamata/Wendi and a Shaddoll fusion card. Another thing is that you can not have neither Resh Shaddoll Incarnation nor Ariel in your hand or the combo wouldn't work. Now here's the combo:
<ul>
 	<li>Activate Meltdown-get Aleister-normal summon Aleister to get Invocation.</li>
 	<li>Link summon Aleister into Moon-maiden.</li>
 	<li>Fusion summon Construct by sendingÂ  either Squamata/Wendi and the link monster to the GY (Construct cl1 Wendi cl2 to chain block)</li>
 	<li>Special summon Aerial face-down and sending Resh to the GY.</li>
 	<li>Link summon Gravity controller using Construct (make sure to summon Construct on one of the extra monster zone).</li>
 	<li>Activate Construct in the GY to get the fusion card back.</li>
 	<li>Activate Resh in the GY to banish it and Construct to flip Ariel and activate it's flip effect to special summon Construct from the banished zone.</li>
 	<li>Activate Construct's effect to send Schism to the GY (If you already have the Schism then I'd suggest you send the Shaddoll Beast to draw 1 card).</li>
 	<li>Link summon Anaconda using Ariel and Construct.</li>
 	<li>Get Schism back to the hand with Construct's effect.</li>
 	<li>Activate Invocation to special summon a Mechaba by banishing the Aleister and a light (preferably the link 2).</li>
 	<li>Activate Invocation in the GY to shuffle it back to the deck and get Aleister to your hand.</li>
 	<li>Now activate Anaconda to get out your Dragoon and set the Schism.</li>
</ul>
Now you have a pretty scary board with 2 semi-omni negate and a set Schism. If you got yourself to the full combo without any interruptions you've pretty much win the Duel here. But of course in reality the chances of you actually pulling off a full-combo is very rare so make sure to conserve your materials and even if you have all the cards you need for the it, I'd suggest you just hold them off and wait for a better opportunity where you know for sure that your opponent doesn't have a negate for it since all fusion decks have a big weakness in card advantage so keeping your materials to go all out is better in my opinion. Now I'll go over some of the more notable pieces of this deck:
<ol>
 	<li>Reeshaddoll Wendi: The wind fairy of the deck. This card basically revived the entire archetype when it first came out along with Resh Shaddoll Incarnation. For the longest time ever this deck needs an extender to turbo out your Shaddoll monsters for more material and the ability to recycle it's material or even boss monsters and these two cards basically resolve everything. Having the ability to special summon from the deck is one of, if not, the most ban-worthy effect of all time and this card has it on BOTH of it's effect. Also this card also serves as a wind material for you to go into Invoked Raidjin, which is pretty much a Book Of Moon with legs.</li>
 	<li>Shaddoll Schism: The absolute nightmare for combo decks with it's ability to special summon any Shaddoll fusion monsters by banishing the material from the field or GY. So getting out a Winda during your opponent's combo is just a kick to the balls and it can even send to the GY a monster that has the same attribute as the monster that was special summon using Schism's effect-a non-target and non-destruction type of removal is just a cherry on top.</li>
 	<li>El Shaddoll Winda: Basically a no for combo decks. You can only special summon once when this card is on the field and with the attack of 2200 this card can't really be beaten over with almost anything. Also did you know that this card can't be destroyed by card effects?</li>
 	<li>El Shaddoll Construct: The mommy of the deck. This card was once banned for quite a while before coming off the banlist. Our mommy's strength is not just about her ability to destroy any special summoned monsters before the damage step but also the effect of sending cards to and getting them back from the GY is not once per turn at all. So this card has become one of the most important combo piece of the deck to gain a bunch of advantage.</li>
 	<li>Aleister the Invoker: The Invoked and Shaddolls archetypes have always been best friends since the beginning. Being already really strong archetypes themselves , these two works surprising well together to maximize the deck's versatility and ability to turbo out very strong boss monsters and controling the board. This card alone is already an Invoked Mechaba. Overall just a great card for the deck.</li>
 	<li>Magical Meltdown: One of the most broken field spell in the entire game. This card shutdowns almost all type of negation when you summon a fusion monster and it also adds an aleister to your hand???</li>
 	<li>Red-eyes Dark Dragoon: This is the most controversial card I've ever seen. In my opinion I think this card is just a really good boss monster and it's your choice to take the risk of having 2 bricks in your deck or not.</li>
</ol>
Alright and that's the deck list. I don't expect anybody to read 'till the end but I hope you'd give it a try and tell me your opinion down the comments bellow. Anything is very much appreciated :D

Evoltile/Evolsaur Monsters: The Evolsaur monsters are efficient cards to reach the XYZ Toolbox that the deck uses, not only the excellent Evolzar XYZ but also the other generic XYZ 4, 5 and 6 as well. All Evolsaur have the characteristic of having effects only if they are brought to the field by SPECIAL Summon by the effect of an Evoltile monster which makes them Normal Summon horrible. Its effects vary between giving SPECIAL of other DINOs of the hand or GY or interacting with opponent or searching Evoltile for the hand as well (Follow Up). 90% of Evoltile has the effect of bringing Evolsaur to the field by SPECIAL Summon, most bring it straight from the deck, some bring it from the hand and only one is REBORN from the GY. They have different activation conditions and consistency effects as well. Some don't need to activate the effect to give SPECIAL, you just need to tax them with Spells from the deck. The deck has access to a lot of spells and excellent traps which makes the engine consistent and versatile, it sure is a very well done deck and a very smart game mechanic to use Reptile and Dinosaur to make Dragon-type xyz with the evolution theme . Despite being old depending on the hand you open it is possible to make a very strong end board to beat current decks because it is very difficult to play against two Evolzar Laggia or a Laggia and a Dolkka on the field without counting the Megachirella that returns the materials for xyz. It surprises me how many cards this archetype has (between 25 and 30) and to know that it works properly. It is by far the second best among the only 4 Dino archetypes in the game, just behind Structure Deck Dinomasher's Fury.

Evolsaur lv5 and lv6 are optional and it would be better not to use them and just focus on xyz rank 4 because you don't want to see Evolsaur monsters in your hand so you end up brick less and can use cards like Enemy Controller and Trap Evo-Instant and the best Reptile what is Danger!? Tsuchinoko?. Also use the Utopia engine to take out any monsters with the Rank 5 Â S39: Utopia the Lightning or OTK with Double or Nothing!
Remember that even without using lv6 monsters in the deck you should still use a copy of Evolzar Solda because it is possible to do it with the Trap Evo-Singularity.

The Side Deck just has more card options that you can try out to improve the deck."

Unfortunately this deck can't play in the pure version currently because it's outdated so I had to use cards from other Dino archetypes to make it work.

Jurrac Monsters: Battle Phase Oriented, some interaction and card advantage effects when monsters are destroyed or destroyed by battle, some versatility effects interesting to explore but slow in general. Difficulty fielding monsters, too weak for modern yugioh. It would need to be completely redone to be playable today and there are few main deck monsters that can be reused in future support, typical deck that has aged very badly and has not kept up with the game's evolution.

I also leave this very interesting video of a Jurrac decklist for old formats that I found on youtube:
