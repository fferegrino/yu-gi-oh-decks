This is my fourth deck that has been downloaded so far on this website.  Like the name suggests, this deck comprises of cards from one of the most recent Yu-Gi-Oh! Series (Not talking about VRAINS): Arc V's D/D and D/D/D archetype!  This archetype is full of powerful fiend type pendulum monsters with their respected monsters waiting within the extra deck and was used, and not to mention mastered, by none other than Leo Corporations Leo Akaba. (I honestly have a D/D deck myself but I do not have the full series)  Now... Here are a couple of boss monsters that I decided as this decks respective boss monsters:  D/D/D Doom King Armageddon:  This bad boy here is one that is to believe the most powerful pendulum card of its series (excluding the extra deck monsters.)  It has a grand total of 3000 attack points but a low point total of 1000 defense points.  However, the loss in defense points can be greatly protected by its special ability (Which is why I put three.)  When it or other monsters are destroyed (either by battle or card effect), you can choose one of the destroyed monsters and add its attack points to the rest of your monsters. This is specifically why I put three of these guys in.  Extra deck boss monsters:  It was a four-way-tie between D/D/D Super Doom King Bright Armageddon, D/D/D Super Doom King Purple Armageddon, D/D/D Super Doom King Dark Armageddon, and D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc.  For the Super Doom King's, each one of them tends to protect each other (like Declan said during his last duel with Yuya) and especially against non-pendulum and pendulum type monsters. The only reason why I added d'Arc in was for its special ability in which it can convert damage you would have taken into life points from the Dark Contracts."

Main decking 3 because it' s a machine to go into Chimeratech with only 1 normal summon of any of your Snakes (I call the little Cyber Dragons this)  3x Cyber Dragon - Released in Cybernetic Overload, he is a welcome support card and is a must-run to run at 3. Fans have been asking about this for YEARS and we finally got it.  2x Galaxy Soldier - Honestly wanna run 3 but I don't want to see him that much, 3 feels like it limits what I can do with my other cards I draw into.  3x Cyber Dragon Vier - Super good to get you into your links and get more bodies on the board. Weird interactions with this card, beware. You normal any Snake that you wanna Machine Duplication, hold this in your hand. He will boost the ATK of your Cyber Dragons and lock you out of Machine Dupe. Go right ahead and use him after using Machine Dupe since you already resolved it. Doing so will net you an Infinity with the 2 Cyber Dragons straight outta the deck and a Verte Anaconda/Sieger to do whatever. He's super useful and good discard fodder as well. Can fuse with Jizu and be dumped with Rampage Dragon if you want to minimize drawing into him later.  3x Cyber Dragon Core - Little snake here techs you into Cyber Repair Plant (Which with your link 1's, you can send him to the graveyard and immediately use it now since you meet the requirements of the card, searching your Kaiju (seriously this thing being Light AND Machine is stupid synergy) Galaxy Soldier, or anything else you need that's Light and Machine). Nova lets you search Cyber Emergency, Revsystem, or if you have a board you can search Cybernetic Overflow which is one of the few traps that might actually be decent to even set on the field. I'll explain this later. He also searches Cyberload Fusion but you wanna keep that in the deck for Verte Anaconda.  3x Cyber Dragon Nachster - Can ditch another card from your hand to summon itself from the hand. If you ditch a Cyber Dragon you summon Nachster and revive Cyber Dragon. You just summoned two Cyber Dragon monsters for free. You can ditch Herz to trigger his effect, a useless hand trap, an extra kaiju, whatever. He's deceptively bad but his interactions let you set up the graveyard for the next card.  3x Cyber Dragon Herz - His 2nd effect (Hard Once Per Turn) where if it's sent to the graveyard you can add a ""Cyber Dragon"" (hard quotes, the named monster) from your GY or Deck to hand is really good. Beware, none of your Snakes are treated as ""Cyber Dragon"" in the deck, but the ones we run are treated as such in the graveyard. So if you dump him you can get back Nachster, Core, OG Cyber Dragon, or a Vier for whatever you need at the time. He can be dumped via Rampage Dragon. Specifically, Rampage Dragon lets you dump 2 Light Machines so you can send Herz and then a Snake you want to add to your hand that you can't search from your deck otherwise. Rampage, dump Herz and Vier/Core/Nachster and add that to your hand with Herz' effect.  3x Effect Veiler - Recently I threw out Ghost Ogre for this. So when I open up with Impermanence(s) and Veiler(s) I get multiple field negates from hand on my opponents turn. You basically run 6 field negates, and odds are in your favor for opening up with this or a Kaiju to start ruining your opponents board. It's also a tuner, but the only synchro I have in the extra deck is Stardust when I ran Ghost Ogre in the extra deck for the sided Ghost Ogre because Infinity + Stardust comes up a lot.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Spells</td> <td>1x Overload Fusion - Running the 1-of I got the idea from a video, I can't remember but I give credit for whoever came up with the 1x Overload and Cyberload and 1x Verte Anaconda. You run the 1 so you don't draw it and can use it from the deck using Verte Anaconda.  2x Cyber Revsystem - Good combo piece when establishing a board. Searchable and Protects whatever you just summoned. Bring back a Sieger. If this card could bring back Infinity (I wish) easily a 3-of.  3x Cyber Emergency - This card is searchable by Nova due to it being a ""Cyber"" card. What this card does is search for a ""Cyber Dragon"" monster. Specifically, Cyber Dragon, Vier, Nova, Nachster, Herz.  3x Machine Duplication - Only works with Core/Nachster/Herz, but you can summon out 2 Cyber Dragons from your deck due to the name interaction. Beware of summoning out Vier before using this card. Vier, like I said before, boosts your monsters and disables you from using Machine dupe since your monsters need to be under 500 atk. Vier boosts by 500 atk/def and the lowest atk is Herz at 100, totaling at 600 atk. So, use machine dupe and spit out the 2 Cyber Dragons AND THEN summon Vier. This is important since you have 4 monsters on the field by having a snake, dupe, and vier. Which can go into Anaconda/Sieger/Infinity/whatever you wanna accomplish.  2x Cyper Repair Plant - Good amount because it's searchable. Both of it's effects are good, but it's first effect lets you search for Light Machine monsters. Which counts Jizukiru, and Galaxy Soldier.  1x Cyberload Fusion - Never really want to use this first unless you can make an Infinity through Rampage being level 5 for an XYZ. Your 2nd Fusion card for your 2nd copy of Rampage if the first one doesn't secure the OTK. Recycles your Field/Banished cyber dragons to fuse, and is a Quickplay. Usable from the deck by Verte Anaconda. No matter where this is, it's live. Except first turn, oh well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Traps</td> <td>3x Infinite Impermanence - It's Impermanence. Useful from hand if you have to go 2nd, disrupts your opponent who's setting up their board going first. Makes this deck win no matter what turn we go. This and Veiler give you 6 negates in the deck.  2x Cybernetic Overflow - Extremely good removal effect and even lets you set up for Cyberload Fusion. If you brick you can at least search this card to have a Nova and this set to disrupt. AND, and, if it's popped you can search for a Cyber Spell/Trap. So you are f*****g your opponent when this is set regardless.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Extra Deck</span></td> <td><span>2x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon - They really released Chimeratech Fortress Dragon that can contact fuse with 1 or both Extra Monster Zones. Absorb your opponents Apollousa or whatever the hell they put and contact fuse with a little snake, granted you can still normal summon. If not you should lose, but regardless, this thing is really good.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Twin Dragon - Rarely sees play but is there when needed. Can attack twice and if it's boosted with Sieger, turns into a 4900 double swing for a total of 9800 damage.</span>  <span>2x Chimeratech Fortress Dragon - Honestly the whole reason I even started this deck was because the Jizukiru/Snake/ChimeraFort interaction. Every monster in your deck that's named Cyber Dragon on the field can absorb Jizukiru. As Seth from Street Fighter would say, ""Become a part of me!"" cause your opponents board is your 7th monster zone. This is also just a good card if you just wanna contact fuse in a huge Beater and boost it further with Sieger, or just BM and absorb it with Infinity. This deck is deeply synergistic with itself.</span>  <span>2x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon - You get 2 chances tops to OTK your opponent, so run 2. When it's summoned you can pop backrow up to the number of monsters used to fusion summon this guy. Overload/Cyberload can allow you to pop multiple BOARDS worth of backrow TBH, so this card is busted in the hypothetical situation where you're in a 2v1/3v1 or Free For All duel. Also allows itself to dump Light Machines from the deck to gain additional attacks for each monster sent to the GY (dumping a Herz and another snake you wanna search from your GY to your Hand, or just dumping Viers/Galaxy Soldiers/Kaijus just sitting in your deck). That's all it does, and all it needs to do. It's also a Dark Level 5. Go into Infinity if you couldn't finished them off for a board, or make Volcasaurus to pop their board and their lifepoints. Rank 5 cowboy.</span>  <span>1x Stardust Dragon - I honestly had this in when I was running Ghost Ogre, since Cyber Dragon and Rampage were level 5 and can make a Stardust with it. But you can run a Volcasaurus instead for 2 good reasons. 1, if you couldn't finish off your opponent or they had too many monsters, make this and burn them more MP2. 2, it's a rank 5 cowboy and live more often than making a Stardust, that's IF you side in ghost ogre. Do whatever you want. I changed this card as I was writing this deck build guide.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Infinity - Negates 1 effect per turn and can Honor Ark your opponents monster. This is it's deck that it will get it's most potential brought out, being it's the archetype it comes from. Now you can not feel like a jerk for using this card, cause you're running it's archetypal deck haha.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova - Has actual interaction with the deck because it was made for this deck. Nova wasn't invented to go into Infinity in meta decks, silly. (1) Can Special Summon a Cyber Dragon from your GY by detaching 1 card,(2) can also banish a ""Cyber Dragon"" card from your hand or field (your little snakes on the field) to boost NOVA another 2100 atk until the end of the turn. (3) if it's sent to the GY from the field by your opponents card effect, you can just bring out any machine fusion monster from your extra deck. I even forgot about this effect as I was writing this guide TBH, throw in a Barbaroid, The Ultimate Battle Machine for the LULZ.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Sieger - My friend Siegfried here is treated as a Cyber Dragon face-up or in GY, so it interacts with a lot of cards notably Revsystem to revive OTK potential. Busted. If it hasn't attacked in the BP yet, you wanna boost your Rampage another 2100 attack so it can swing 4200 x3 times. We don't play nice in this format. Nobody takes damage involving Sieger, which isn't good or bad but useful to know. This is bad if you wanna swing directly with Sieger, because neither player takes damage. If you attack a monster and you maybe boosted itself or another card, you don't take damage from Utopia the Lightning or Honest. So it works both ways. I think. Double check this.</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda - It's so busted it can make any monster on the field a Dark Monster. It can also use ""Fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" normal or quickplay cards from the deck at the cost of 2000 LP too. Jokes aside, you can't special summon for the rest of the turn after using this, so get whatever monsters you wanna get out before using this effect that turn. It's really good.</span>  <span>1x Linkuriboh - If you open up a hand where you only have Herz or another level 1 cybersnake, you can summon it and send it to link summon into this so you can get a cyber dragon in the grave for maybe Repair Plant, or to get Herz on the field into GY to get a search. It helps bricks. Which is really good.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Almiraj - Super good protection, easy to bring out. Beware you have your &lt;1000 atk monster be normal summoned.</span>  <span>1x Gravity Controller - Decent option, can't be destroyed by battle from main monster zone monsters, also bounces your opponents extra monster zone monster if it battles it.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Side Deck</span></td> <td><span> </span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;"

Can fal","<span>So basically the goal of this deck is to OTK, while opening up cards that can either OTK your opponent straight out or enough cards to stun your opponent while you set up. Jizukiru is a must because of the interaction to Kaiju your opponents biggest threat and contact fuse to get a free Sieger. Effect Veiler/Impermanence are the other cards you'll open up with to disrupt your opponent during their setup. I really don't know if this is meta-worthy or meta-killing but I have something good here that I want to share and get advice to make this deck even better. I'll go through each card choices, this list is by no-means end-all.

It helps bricks. Which is really good.  1x Salamangreat Almiraj - Super good protection, easy to bring out.

The reason it is a Frog the Jam FTK/OTK is because you use him to get the final blow. Make sure you summon The World, Frog the Jam, and Grandmaster of the Six Samurai under Saryuja's arrows so they get the attack boost. Tribute both Legendary Six Samurai Kizan on the end phase of your turn to skip your opponent's turn with The World's effect, then summon them back on your next turn. Make sure the two Kizans don't gain Saryuja's ATK boost. Attack with the two Kizans to do 3600, The World to do it 3400 (with Saryuja's boost), then attack with Frog the Jam to do the last 1000 (he also has Saryuja's boost).  NOTE: Use Saryuja's 2nd eff to summon The World and Frog the Jam. If you run out of Saryujas in your extra deck, use your current Saryuja to make a Cross-Sheep, use two Kizans to make an Emeral, then shuffle the 3 Saryujas back with Emeral's effect. The side deck is completely optional."

Able to summon both Evil Hero Dark Gaia/Malicious Bane and Fossil Fusion with only Stratos + 1 earth lv4 monster, ","Happy Revenge of the Fifth day! Who would have thought that both Evil HERO and Fossil still have synergy in 2020 and is viable? Reminsicing the time we were playing in GX Tag Force or watching the anime, Supreme King was a tough guy to beat with his big Evil HERO Dark Gaia, while Jim Crocodile Cook was having his Fossil Fusion exclusive in the game and anime only, until now. Also so many new cards printed, making this build consistent and able to put big damage or break board in one turn going second. I will explain the combo and lineup here.  What we need is <strong>Elemental HERO Stratos + any earth lv4 monster</strong>, so we play E - Emergency Call, Solid Soldier (or Heroic Challenger Assault Halberd, pretty good if going second), and RotA to make it consistent. Combo is very simple, we search Addusted Gold via Stratos, use Addusted search Dark Calling, make Gallant Granite add Gigantes by detaching earth material, ss Gigantes make Verte (now we have 2 rocks in GY, Gallant and Gigantes). We can use Dark Calling to fusion for Dark Gaia or Malicious Bane if we have lv5+ in hand and we can use Verte to copy Fossil Fusion since we have rock in GY (some Fossil monster needs opponent's monster in GY as material).  HERO lineup: 3 Stratos, 2-3 Solid Soldier, 2 Addusted Gold, 1 Shadow Mist (Foolish Burial target, to search), 3 Emergency Call, 2 Dark Calling (can add Dark Fusion too if you want), and RotA. Assault Halberd has hero too in its name being Heroic Challenger (lol jk, its just free lv4 earth monster).  Fossil lineup: 2 Weathering Soldier (Foolish Burial target, searching Fossil Fusion), 2-3 Fossil Fusion (I only play 2 cus we have Verte and many other searchers), 2 Miracle Rupture (2 cus once per turn, dumps Weathering Soldier to GY), 1 Time Stream (Weathering Soldier target, super reliant on Fossil monster).  Other Support: 2 Nibiru 1 Kongrade (Running 3 Nibiru is an overkill and most combo deck can play around it; Kongrade is just another useful big atk and lv rock monster, despite being situational), 2 Radian Kaiju (useful big atk and lv fiend monster), Gigantes (combo piece while being a lv4 monster, can be replaced with Adamancipator Researcher), Nemeses Keystone (recycles banished card and itself while being rock monster, you can cut it since it will rarely used), Foolish Burial (self explanatory), Extra-Foolish Burial (to trigger the Fossil monster GY effect, utility card), Double or Nothing (OTK if has the opportunity), and the rest is just breaking board card or handtrap.  Extra Deck: 2 Skullgar (playing 2 cus its the easiest to summon while can be sent to GY for searching Fossil Fusion), 2 Malicious Bane (best Evil HERO).  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/2e0s5pW.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Nostalgic, consistency is ""<em>acceptable</em>"", able to break board or prevent opponent from building board, big monsters, and can even OTK. Fossil Fusion is free against Adamancipator.  Cons: 2 cards combo, super fragile, recursion is almost nothing, sometimes unable to put lethal damage (esp. when we use Malicious bane effect making us unable to atk except with HERO monster).  <strong>PS: the 1 card missing is Nemeses Keystone</strong>"

Exceed allows you to easily make a rank 4, which can be vital vs Adamancipator and Eldlich, but it also gives you Accesscode Talker, a wonderful new link that you can climb into for a nigh unstoppable new OTK. Some new additions to the deck are Formud Skipper, and One for One to summon it. Formud Skipper acts as your way to search Exceed thus increasing its consistency. I'm running 3 copies of exceed since you want to see it every hand and im running desires so we dont want to risk banishing the other copy. Due to Adamancipator and Eldlich, hand traps are not very recommended due to their low impact. The 2 best ones to main deck are Ash Blossom since it can block all of the Eldlixers as well as both Gallant Granite &amp; Block Dragon. We also main deck Lancea to stop Eldlich's advantage engine and to deny Adamancipators the chance to summon block dragon."

This is (no pun intended) a very special gem to me, as I don't think a lot of people realize just how strong this deck is with its own archtype. People keep adding cards outside the archtype, throwing in unnecessary traps or spells and it actually slows the deck down a lot. I used to shock people that I could even get out rainbow dragon as consistently as I did, and that was well before cards like crystal bond, conclave, ultimate magic (I had a high speed version that utilized advanced dark). Point is, there is a surprising amount of synergy in the cards alone, I can't say this can keep up with meta decks these days, but its still way faster than it used to be and really consistent. Getting out a turn two rainbow dragon is not hard, by turn 4+ you definitely have a few ways to win, whether its rainbow dragon, ultimate dragon, or abundance OTK. This is only going to get faster with Zenith coming out, although I'm hard pressed to figure out what to cut from this since the ratios are super perfect as is. (maybe one ruins, one bridge?)"

You can save yourself some grief if you wanna add beckoning light(s) to the deck, also people are afraid to have lightsworn at 40, but you don't really have to fear much. If JD gets negated/dies/etc. your other win condition is the actual lightsworn dragon which gets really beefy in this build. Shira does too for that matter.

Madolche lesson is quite live in this build, but it becomes a bit of a win more card since your field is probably already OTK worthy, though I've had times where a well timed lesson bumps all my monsters when opponent thought they could clear some of them. Nobody ever expects lessons, cus nobody plays it, even though it works so well in this deck. I don't wanna go through more stuff, cus this is my favorite deck, and I won't be heart broken if it stays as a personal gem of mine."

I really like this build, hopefully so do you. Please leave feedback and help the Crusadia community out :)!  Some comments overall:  ** General comments / Main Deck ** <ul>  	<li>I think Chaos Dragon Levianeer is just an insane card (you will see later on in my combos why). Multiple copies of it are live with any 2 starters/extenders in opening hand. You always have the option to use its Monster Reborn/pop 2 effect. If you dont like this card you might want to opt for multiples of Pot of Avarice, serving a similar purpose (that is, this deck can spam extra deck monsters like crazy).</li>  	<li>This is a going 1st deck. The main strategy is a 1.5 combo with Formud Skipper (leave a comment if you want a more detailed description) that ends on Bagooska + omni negate from Equimax + Crusadia Krawler. If you survive the 1st turn, then turn 2 you activate Crusadia Krawler, search World Legacy Succesion, combo off (including a search for Crusadia Leonis for piercing damage) and you should have at least 8k damage on board. This combo can also be achieved by Chaos Dragon Levinaar + lvl 4 Crusadia + any Crusadia monster.</li>  	<li>Crusadia really is a 15 card engine. This allows for the inclusion of a bunch of handtraps (no coincidence they are light and dark monster ofc, wink wink Chaos Dragon) and cards like Cosmic Cyclone. I have always been a fan of this card against pretty much any deck (e.g. Salamangreat, backrow, even decks like Cyber Dragon), but it is particularly good this format ofcourse.</li>  	<li>Parallel Exceed is why this deck works (hence the post ETCO). You run 3 + 2 + 2 copies (Formud Skipper/Cynet Mining) of this card. Any Crusadia monster + this card is full combo. Also note the Linguriboh in the extra deck for the easy link climb/backrow matchup.</li> </ul> ** Extra deck ** <ul>  	<li>Crusadia Magius is nuts. Really. Any 2 cards allows you to bring all of them on the field/in the GY, making room to abuse Chaos Dragon Levianeer or similar cards.</li>  	<li>Link Spider for when you get Nibirud! They Nibiru you, you link into Link Spider and you can extend with the Crusadia Monsters :).</li>  	<li>Crystron Needlefiber is new too! When you have Crusadia Arboria on the field + any link monster, you can do the ``standard'' link climb, but have an intermediate Needlefibre in between. This results in 2 Arboria in GY, which means better grind game. Seems pretty good to me!</li>  	<li>Topologic Trisbaena is NUTS! Its super easy to make in this deck, not OPT, and can be chain blocked with Crusadia Krawler. Is pretty much an instant win against any backrow heavy deck.</li> </ul> ** Side Deck ** <ul>  	<li>Kaiju package for going 2nd (I mean, it is Crusadia after all...).</li>  	<li>Heavy Storm Duster is nice for backrow/Mystic Mine matchup ofcourse.</li>  	<li>TCBOO because this deck can play it.</li> </ul> Leave suggestions and comments below! Crusadia players are STRONG!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With Cynet Mining, it makes us play 9 starters. Add those ","With Scrypton added to TCG (idk about OCG tho), it makes Formud Skipper a must use in Marincess. Not only it acts as extender itself, Scrypton recycles the banished together with Marincess Great Bubble Reef. I will explain both Blue Tang and Formud route (both still needs extender tho).  Normal summon Blue Tang, dump Sea Horse (or Mandarin if you alrdy have Sea Horse), make Blue Slug add Sea Horse from GY, ss Sea Horse make Sea Angel add Battle Ocean. From here we need another extender to continue with applied Crystal Heart. Ss the extender, make Coral Anemone (if you wanna recur your Marincess in GY or if you wanna make a link 4) in extra zone, make Crystal Heart, place field spell (always place field spell when you're about to make your last big monster with Crystal Heart), ss any big link Marincess monster (Marbled Rock if first turn, battle protection, and can recur your resource too; Great Bubble Reef to recur banished or in GY Marincess; Wonder Heart to OTK if locked to water; Accescode via Splash Mage - Transcode route for optimal OTK).  The Formud route, normal summon Formud (or via one for one), use Formud choose any Marincess in extra deck, make Sea Angel, add field spell then Scrypton from Formud, ss Scrypton make Coral Anemone, use Coral ss Sea Angel. From here we need extender to continue. SS extender, make Blue Slug (you can choose not to use its effect so the big link will have more equip later), then make Crystal Heart so we have enough material for link 4 (Marbled Rock is preferred despite it's a link 3).  I only run 2 Pascalus because we run many other extender which are not its target, 1 Mandarin because its condition is kinda situational. The rest is just extender or staple with the trap lineup to turbo out Marincess Wave since Blue Tang cant search it consistently enough while still running another great target for Trap Trick.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/d0Kalvb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent, big immune body, great recursion, bunch of handtraps, and can even run Deep Sea Minstrel (to snipe oppnent's handtrap).  Cons: Standard board is just big immune tower with no interruption, sometimes water/cyberse locked  Cards to think of: Frog lineup (Marincess is a 2 cards combo, so adding another 2 cards combo engine conflicts with each other), Mermail Abyssteus-spike engine (it searches Sea Horse, but needs 2 water discards, at that point we could combo with those 2 cards instead of running this engine), Kaiju (Gameciel is a must for side deck), Abyss Dweller (great card, but needs consistent Pascalus to make it, and most deck can still play around Dweller easily)."

This build excels on breaking boards, and by going first it can easily set up a Winda lock via Cherubini and Instant Fusion, Verte Anaconda really helps this deck on mantaining a reasonable amount of threat and by bringing out my ace monster, Starving Venom.  Ultra Poly is Strong because it turns my basic combo into a Chimerafflesia+Verte Anaconda, however, it does not simply bring good as it can brick, fortunately you only need one copy of it on the deck, and because this deck ""branches"" a lot on its combos, you can live without searching it.  Now on the card review:  Kaijus: As a going second deck, we have to deal with some powerfull monsters, and Verte simply turns any of them into material for Starving Venom, Greedy Venom or even Triphyovertum.  Heliamphorhyncus: Searchable easy Greedy Venom material.  Pankratops: A good Versatile threat.  Drosophyllum Hydra: Searchable ""Kaiju"" under the right conditions, and can activate its effect to drain 500 Atk from an opponent's monster, i know, conditional, however useful.  Spinodionaea: Good card paired with Predapractice and a target for Scorpio's effect, can put counters.  Edge Imp Chain: Part of the Patchwork Engine, can search Patchwork itself by being sent as a cost by Scorpio.  Edge Imp Sabres: Part of the Patchwork Engine, can be revived via its own effect to easily put bricks back onto the deck and be used as a material for Verte or her Effect.  Ophrys Scorpio: Bread and Butter of the deck, main enabler, allows for many of the deck's branching combos, you always want it on your hand and alongside the edge imps.  Darlingtonia Cobra: Allows for an important search, such as Ultra Poly, Instant Fusion and Superpoly.  Lonefire: Unfortunately, we need consistency, this isn't a bad card by any means, but it isn't a good card either, being easily ""Hand Trapped"", Called, ""Impermed"" and such, it does best when you don't have any more options.  Chlamydosundew: Fusion Enabler, combos with Spinodionaea and Ophrys Scorpio.  Sarraceniant: Enables search and sometimes used in a pinch via its own effect by being used as a ""Hand Trap"".  Cordyceps: Ok, this is new, i don't like this one that much,enables the closing of some games via its powerful effect and can trigger Darlingtonia, useful on the grind and allows for a powerful follow-up.  Predaponics: Basic revival for more material or for a lost Sarraceniant for more search.  Predaprunning: Revives the big Fusions.  Frightfur Patchwork: The engine enabler itself, allows for Poly Searching, Half Chimerafflesia Searching and Scorpio Cost Search, while also maintaining card advantage.  Instant Fusion: Allows the Winda lock and for you to play safe when going second, useful card.  Mind Control: Grab some Apollousas :&gt;, Seriously now, it lets you grab something to make Verte.  Polymerization: Enables the best summoning method :).  Pot of Desires: Consistency.  Predapractice: Helps with combos, consistency and such, allows Spinodionaea and Sarraceniant to be more productive.  Ultra Poly: Card Advantage, allowing Verte to come onto the field more easily.  Predaprime Fusion: Allows for Otk and substitutes Verte in case of Predapractice before the link summon.  Super Polymerization: Board Break, Mind Break(not the actual card) and usually people forfeit easily after this card, allows for your Fusions to easily access the field, while looking at your crying opponent, combos with Verte.  Evenly Matched: See Superpoly until the Fusion part, allows Spell/Trap dealing.  Impermanence: Hand Trap and being a ""Must Negate"" on board breaking(sometimes).  EXTRA DECK  Greedy Venom: Evolution of my dragon, allows OTK and Threatens the opponent, but be careful as it can nuke everything including your own field.  Triphyovertum: Negates Summons, High Attack, can be Revived easily.  Starving Venom: My Ace, easily eats opponent's monsters by absorbing their ATK, can copy effects and nukes opponents's boards.  Dragostapelia: Puts Counters, Negates effects, can be revived easily.  Chimerafflesia: Can topple almost any monster, Banishes low level monsters, Search Superpoly or any fusion card for the next turn(your opponent will keep that in mind).  Earth Golem: Superpoly target.  Winda: Superpoly target and enables her Lock.  Mudragon: Superpoly target and can be used by instant fusion to protect your monsters against target.  Millenium-Eyes: Protects against almost any monster effect, can be used as a material for Dragostapelia, just like Mudragon, Winda and Earth Golem.  BLS Link: Easily allowed by Scorpio, sometimes wins games.  Cherubini: Winda Lock.  Verte Anaconda: Allows for Superpolying on your opponent's board, sometimes for a second time, makes your own kaijus not threatening anymore(as if they were in the first place) and makes Gameciel an enabler for Greedy Venom.  SIDE DECK: Still working on one as it is format dependant, probably some going first cards.  Q&amp;A  ""Why don't you run Lightning Storm?""  Too Pricy, can't have it for now.  ""Since when do you play around with this archetype?""  Since they were announced, played with them physically with only INOV cards, basically Starving Venom Turbo OTK.  ""How many builds of Predaplant do you have?""  I'm around 340 builds rn.  ""Why do you keep playing with this archetype as there are more competitive decks running around?""  Well, i'm a mostly competitive player and i like the archetype a lot, as i had a very lonely infancy so i played with plants, i have a Dionaea Muscipula, Stapelia Grandiflora and some others since those times.  ""Will you keep making builds for this deck and posting them on here?""  Well, i will probably post some builds here, as i don't have that much time in my hands for now, i will probably keep building more of them though as i want to top with them at least once.  END OF THE LESSON  This build isstill being worked on, so i might upload a slightly different one later as i am testing it against meta.  Hope you liked, like and share the build if possible.  With regards, Joeri.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The surrounding of necrovalley shuts down almost all of the current decks, such as Eldlich, Sky Striker Recursion, Orcust, Borrel, and Salamangreat, while also giving you protection to use handtraps freely. This variant also includes the ability to go super poly into starving and mudragon. This also has an interesting tech against Altergeist, where you can take their monsters for Quintet Magician, then wipe the rest of their board. But basically, the best thing to do search Spiritualist as quickly as possible then go into Supernaturalist with Necrovalley up. Also a good tech is Almarduk to use against Link Spammers.  My favorite thing is to set Spy with backrow floodgates and necrovalley, flip spy to summon recruiter, link into Witch's Apprentice, get the search from recruiter for whatever you need(Spiritualist or other Gravekeeper for fusion) Then go into Supernaturalist. Lowest it can be in this situation is 3700 ATK."

Keep stunning your opponent by destroying your own spells and traps.,"This is a pure True Draco deck. Even with some of its cards on the banlist it still does pretty well in disruption and consistency. Since you won't need your special summons you can use duality and demise without worrying about much. Keep stunning you opponent's spells and traps by destroying your true draco traps or take out monsters with your true draco spells.  Attack: 4/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 5/5  Strong against: Rokket, Shaddoll  Weak against: Altergeist, Kaiju  Since this isn't such a complicated deck I'm not putting any combos on here because you should figure it out quickly :P  In my opinion this deck is good for beginners to try on Yugioh simulators and to get to know the game. It's a bit expensive for the average person but if you are willing to spend the money, you are almost guaranteed to beat everyone in your locals. Have fun!"

You'll always want to see boss stage in your hand because it's one of the main win conditions in the deck. You'd also want to start with Aleister so you can use him as a onecard Mechaba. If you have Mechaba on the field and Monstrosity in your hand, you can activate Monstrosity to summon out two more level 9s and use those two for true king of all calamities to lock out your opponent in their turn. Then once it's you opponent's turn, use boss stage's effect to summon out preferably either hoarr or nidhogg to completely sut out your opponent. This could reach up to 3-4 negates in one turn. You can also use kaiju slumber either as bait for spells/traps or to wipe out the field and just make your plays from there. Lots of boss monsters and negates mean easy win."
